Fridays my mother cleans at the Wiltons ' , and last week she said the lady , Mrs. Wilton , asked her if she knew anyone who could give an estimate on some remodeling work . My mother likes to tell people what I can do with a hammer and nails . I can hear her as clear as if I 'm standing right there , her voice with the cigarettes in it , telling Mrs. Wilton about her carpenter son . <p> She came home all excited , of course . Sure that she 'd found me a job . I was sitting in my chair on the porch , and was n't in much of a cheerful mood . And she said it 's not like me , which is true enough . My little boy , Willy , who 's almost eleven years old and ought to know better , had left his brand-new baseball glove out in the yard and the dog had got to it . Dog 's not even our do  --  this German shepherd pup the people next door are planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the thumb . <p> I 'd been wanting to get Willy interested in baseball , and to tell the truth Willy 'd rather play soldier with little plastic men . So I was giving him some words about the baseball glove , trying to be the good father , wondering to myself if they called him sissy in school and wanting , even if I do n't know exactly how to go about it , to at least be there for him , tending to him and giving a damn what happens to him  --  like my father never was or did for me , and , well , to tell you the real truth I was mad at him , too , about this first-baseman 's mitt that I could n't afford in the first place being left out all night  --  and when my mother walked up announcing that she 'd got me a job , this whole other area of worry came in on me , as if you could forget a thing like being out of work . <p> " You 'd never let a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Okay , " I said . " It just should n't have happened . " <p> " Well , it 's all going to be better now . " <p> " Go on inside , " I said to Willy . <p> He hung a little at the door while she went on telling me about the job . He wanted to know , too . But I was still peeved at him , could n't help this feeling that he 'd begun to depend on her to smooth things over when he was being disciplined . I mean this was n't the first time she 'd stepped between us , and Willy is smart . And I do n't mean to make any excuse for it , but being in the kind of trouble we 're in does n't make for much in the way of patience , at times . Maybe she should 've stepped between us a time or two . But sometimes it feels like you put so much into a child , into the raising of him , you love him so hard that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Go on , " I said to him , feeling low and mean , and out of control some way , watching him go on in . <p> " Are you listening ? " my mother said . <p> " I 'm listening , Ruth . The lady wants an estimate . " <p> " Paint and carpentry , too . She wants a ceiling redone , and some molding put up , and wallpaper . The library needs redoing and the whole porch has to be rebuilt and painted and all the eaves have to be done , too . This is your job if you play your cards right . " <p> Nothing ever stops her . She moved to the door and caught Willy , who had come back and was standing there . She put her arms around him and asked how 's her little man . And there have been times when I thought both she and Janet baby him too much . <p> " I told you to go on inside , " I said to him . <p> " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are you riding him again ? " she said to me , but she was smiling . It takes so little to make her happy . From the kitchen I could hear Janet rattling dishes . She 'd come in from work and insisted that she would put dinner on , as she always does when things are getting her down . Lately she has n't been very good about hiding the strain she feels with Ruth here , and of course there 's no place for Ruth to go , not to mention the fact that Ruth is also bringing in a good part of the income these days . These days , she and Janet make the money , and I generally keep the house . <p> You have to know that I 've been all over the area looking for anything : busboy , clerk , salesman , janitor  --  anything . The three houses I worked on the last time I had any kind of steady work are still standing empty in that big meadow south of here , and the builder  --  Teddy Aubrey  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's down to selling Oldsmobiles in Charlottesville . Went bust as a builder just after the first of the year . One of the new houses that he did manage to sell he never finished , and the people who live there do n't have any screens , are stuck with a dirt-and-weed patch as a lawn . No hydroseeding because Baylor , who does hydroseeding around here , refused to do anything unless Aubrey could pay him in cash . <p> Which is what I should 've done . I worked two months in the last one , flooring and dry wall and painting , and even a little plumbing , and I never got paid a penny for it . I went over to the new house last week and asked if I could hydroseed for them ; I 'd charge half what Baylor charges . Just enough above cost to pay my damn rent . Anything . But they do n't have any ready cash , either . <p> " I ca n't take blood from a stone , " Aubrey tells me over the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from college myself . I do n't know what I 'm going to do . " <p> Well , he 's selling cars , is what he 's doing . So he still drives a long cool Lincoln . I get cards from him saying " Come on in . " <p> " When the big ones go down they bring all the little ones down with them , " Ruth said . <p> " I would n't characterize Teddy Aubrey as big , " I told her . " Nor me as being so damn small , either . " I meant it as a joke ; I was always joking and kidding around before the trouble started . I knew it did n't come out sounding like any joke . <p> She said , " I meant the real estate companies , honey . " <p> When I was a kid we lived in a nice house in the country . Central air before anyone else had it . Swimming pool . Extra rooms , the works . My father worked high up for the airlines . Top-level executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody in every week to help out with the housekeeping : this big Mexican lady with a partially cut-off ear , who was always blessing the house with her rosary . The ear looked like someone had snipped it with scissors , a planned cut , part of some ritual or other , or at least that was how I thought of it until I heard my mother say it was the scar of an accident , the result of a fight with her husband , who still lived with her . Knowing this , I was always tempted to ask how it happened  --  but I never let on that I had noticed it at all . I wondered about the scar a lot , though , especially after my father went off to start a new life somewhere else . It seemed that whenever I thought of the cleaning lady I saw that sudden place where her ear just stopped being there , and how she and the one who did that to her were still married . <p> When I say my father went off to start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too : a man with a new name , a new identity , in another state , or maybe even in another country , who knows ? He was gone a lot , anyway , before he went for good , and so I never felt much connection with him . I guess I was always a little afraid of him , and was n't particularly sad to realize that he was n't coming back , except that we started having trouble making payments . We wound up moving to this little place in the north end of the county , living with Ruth 's older brother and his new wife , who it seemed I never saw in anything but a nightgown and robe , no matter what time of day it was , the whole time we lived there . Someone had told her once that she looked like that movie star , what 's her name  --  Katharine Hepburn  --  and I guess it went to her head a little . She wore her hair in exactly the style of those old movies , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her , always in some kind of uproar , like a person playing a scene in a movie . She loved piano music . It was always on in that house , always coming from their room during the nights , and we all knew it was part of the act . But she had a good laugh , too , and she did n't mind helping us out . We all tolerated each other 's ways , and we shared the bills , and had some fun in the evenings . By then I was working in the summers as an apprentice to Mr. Hall , who was contracting with Aubrey for almost everything . Then Mr. Hall retired , and I took over , and for a while there I had a pretty steady source of income , even in the winter months . That was our life for a time . It was what I ended my growing up in . When the changes came , they came quick . Or at least it seemed that way to me . <p> First , I got married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks about how scary that is , having a child . Being a father . At least nobody talked to me about it . I was plenty scared , but I loved that baby so much it hurt . Then when Willy was three , my uncle and his wife ran into trouble with each other and got a divorce , and while she moved to Hollywood ( none of us asked why ) , he went north , to Boston . He left the house for my mother , and of course she called and asked me to move back , with Janet and Willy . <p> " There 's so much room , " she said . " It 's lonesome here . " <p> But we were happy where we were , though we fought a lot over dumb things the way people do when they 're finding out how to be with each other all the time . <p> " We 'll come visit you , " I told my mother . <p> So we 'd go over for weekends . We 'd play with Willy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or have a few rounds of gin rummy while he slept . I 'd read something to Willy before he went to bed every night . It got so he knew the stories by heart , and then as he got older and was in school , he 'd read them to me . He 'd tell me how thins went at school . I 'd come in from reading him a story and the two women would be dealing the cards , laughing and teasing each other . We might as well have lived over there . <p> But then , a couple years ago , things started to go sour for her brother up in Boston , and he had to let go of the house in Virginia . This was just before the real estate business fell through the floor around here . Anyway , Mom had to move in with us . It was supposed to be temporary . And it 's a different thing when you have to live together . <p> Nobody  --  I mean nobody  --  thought everything would dry up so suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this poor county was building houses . It was coming down all around and we just did n't see it . There had been slumps and setbacks before , but everything always bounced back . This time it got so Teddy Aubrey could n't pay me for work I 'd already done , though he kept promising he 'd catch it all up , and I believed him because I could n't afford not to . For a while I was doing things on pure spec  --  working for nothing in the hope of some new development . But every shift in the winds just brought more trouble , and as you know the bill collectors and the banks never have been too notable for understanding this kind of thing . <p> The reason I bring all this up now is so you 'll understand what we came from , and where we had been , and maybe you 'll know how much it hurt me every time I saw that woman come walking up the sidewalk with her hair tied back like that , wearing sweatclothes and no makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd raised me ; she 'd never trained herself for anything else . She 'd been led to believe by everybody and everything that she would never have to , if she did n't want to . Now she 'd taken to smoking again . Her cough was back . I hated that , and so every day I was out looking for something , anything , any kind of work . Even handyman stuff , which I did get now and then-forty dollars here and fifty dollars there . Enough for a couple days ' worth of groceries , or maybe for part of one payment . <p> Do n't get me wrong . There are plenty of people worse off than we are . I 'm not asking for sympathy , really . What I 'm trying to do here is explain . <p> The night she came home with the news about Mrs. Wilton and the remodeling job , we all celebrated . We had a little beer in Ruth 's old champagne glasses , toasting Mrs. Wilton and her big old house . Janet already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer . Five thousand dollars net , at least . She hugged Willy and teased him about the baseball glove , and after dinner she asked Ruth , " How about a game of gin rummy ? " <p> We had n't played cards since the first days after Ruth moved in with us . Ruth looked at my wife and nodded with the best smile-a smile like all the good days we 'd had . It made me happy , and when I tried to tease them about the noise they 'd make , for a second I could n't quite find my voice . <p> I went in and watched the ball game , with the sound up fairly loud in case Willy did n't know it was on . He stayed in the kitchen with the women . <p> " Hey , " I said . " Willy ? " I was feeling good . I thought all I had to do was show him how happy I was . <p> He came to the door . <p> " Ball game 's on , " I said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I heard it , " he said . One thing I just hate is when a man does n't look you in the eye . When I was nine I was playing third base in Little League , and looking straight back at people . <p> " Come here , " I said . <p> " I do n't want to watch the game , Dad . " <p> I got up and turned the game off , and when I went into the kitchen he was standing by his grandmother 's chair . <p> " Get your mitt , " I said . <p> " I do n't want to , " he said . Still not looking at me . <p> I told him , " Stand up straight , son . " <p> And Janet said , " Leave him alone about it , will you ? You already yelled at him about it . " <p> " I wanted to throw the ball around , " I said . <p> " Okay , " Willy said . Whining . <p> No , " I told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go throw the ball around with your son , " Ruth said . <p> So we went out into the yard . My heart was n't in it . I felt wrong , and Willy looked like somebody being punished . He was scared of the ball , I could tell . " Okay , " I said , " I 'm beat . " <p> " Sure ? " he said . <p> " Really . " <p> He was a little too quick going up on the porch , and I guess he sensed it because he stopped at the door again . For just that second he stood in exactly the same stance as he did when I was mad at him earlier . Even the same look on his face . " If you want to , we can play catch some more , " he said . <p> " That 's all right , " I told him , and I patted his skinny shoulder . My boy . " You go on in , " I said . <p> I sat on the porch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cards , Willy making little war sounds with his mouth , his toy men . It was a pretty twilight . The sun came through the leaves and there was a little breeze stirring . I could hear the traffic way out on Route 29 , but the birds were singing , too . I felt sad , and it was as if I could turn around in myself and look at the feeling . I thought about how things go on , and other changes come . Ruth 's parents went through the Depression . <p> I was thinking about this when Ruth came out . : <p> " What about cards ? " I said . <p> " Janet 's using the powder room . Thought I 'd come out and smoke a cigarette . " <p> Janet does n't let her smoke in the house . She lighted up , standing there . Nobody enjoys a cigarette like my mother . " So , " she said . " We 'll go over to Mrs. Wilton 's at nine o'clock . I mean that 's when I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I told her I 'd bring you over and introduce you . " <p> " How bad did you brag on me , Ruth ? " <p> " I 'm not bragging . " She blew smoke , then she looked down at her feet in the tennis shoes . " I need new shoes . " <p> " Yes , ma'am , " I said . <p> " These are comfortable , though . " <p> " They 're falling apart . " <p> " They 're like an old pair of slippers , " she said , crossing one over the other . She leaned on the railing and smoked . " An old pair of slippers , " she said again . Then she sighed , and when she started talking again there was something else in her voice  --  she was someone remembering a thing with pain . Except it was n't quite that , either , because I heard no regret in it , and she did n't seem sad . " You know , I used to sap that was how your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of slippers . It used to make me feel good saying it . Imagine . " <p> " I think I remember you saying it , " I told her . <p> " It was a little joke we had , " she said . <p> I was quiet . <p> Then she said , " He never was much of a father to you . " <p> " No , " I said . <p> And she said , " I think you 're doing the right thing with Willy . " <p> " Well , " I said . " I wish I knew for sure , sometimes . " <p> Inside , Janet was shuffling the cards . " Mom " she said . <p> " Be right there , " Ruth said . Then she flicked the cigarette out on the lawn and leaned down to kiss me on the cheek . For a second I had this funny feeling , what she must 've been like when she was young , a girl , before her husband took everything she had to give him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said to me . " I think it 's going to work out fine . " <p> Mrs. Wilton lives in those hills south of here . A big gray house with about four different entrances . I could n't go with Ruth at nine o'clock because Willy messed around in his room and wound up missing the bus for school and I had to drive him , so Ruth called Mrs. Wilton and set up a visit for a little later in the morning . I got Willy in the car and we headed out , neither one of us much in the mood for talk . He stared out his side . I had yelled at him for putting everything on his mother , and then Janet got miffed at me for coming down on him too hard . It was a sunny morning , and I felt like hell . <p> " I do n't mean to be too hard on you , " I said to Willy . <p> Nothing . It made me mad . <p> " You hear what I said ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . " <p> I took his shoulder so he looked at me and then pointed out the windows of the car . " That 's the world out there , son . They do n't care a goddamn whether you make it or not . You understand ? They 'd just as soon walk over you as look at you . And it 's my job to make you ready for it . Get you so you can walk out in it and not get knocked on your ass . " I was yelling now . But I felt right . I did n't mean for him to do any daydreaming while I told him , and what I was telling him was the truth . " I need you to be tough , " I said . I said , " I do n't want you coming back to me when you 've been out there and saying you did n't know , that I did n't tell you . " <p> " Okay , " he said . And he started to cry . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm telling you the truth . " <p> " Yes , sir . " He was giving me this look , like a scared rabbit . <p> " Goddamnit , " I said . " Sit up straight . " It was like everything I 'd been through came rushing up behind my eyes , and I wanted to hit him . " Sit up , " I said . " And stop blubbering . You baby . " <p> He sat straight , looking at me out of the corner of his eye , ready to duck , as if all he ever had from me was getting hit . I have never hit him , or anyone else for that matter . I ca n't explain it any better than this . In my mind I saw myself reach over and smack him . I was that close . I did n't even like him in that minute . " Quit being such a baby about it , " I said . " Stop crying right now . NOW ! " <p> " Yes , sir . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wet all over his face  --  tears and stuff from his nose . He kept sniffling , and his hands went up to his mouth . I thought he might 've gagged . <p> " Okay , I 'm sorry , " I said . " I did n't mean to yell at you . " <p> Then I was just driving , and he was leaning over against the window , still sniffling . We went on that way for a while , and when I looked at his back , I felt something drop down inside me , like a big collapsing wall . <p> " They do n't care about you out there , " I told him , when I could get my voice again . But it sounded empty , now , and I knew something else had happened . I wished I had another mind , some other set of memories . <p> When we pulled into the school parking lot I took ahold of his arm . " You all right now ? " said . I could n't find any other voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goddamn drill sergeant or something . He just nodded , and I could see that all he wanted was to get away from me . I told him again . " I did n't mean to hurt your feelings . It just got me going . " <p> " Yes , sir , " he said . That little , scared , kid's-crying voice . <p> " All right , " I said . And let him go . He got out , dropped a book and bent over to get it  --  a boy out in front of a big brick-and-aluminum building , going through a bad morning in his life . I watched him walk on into the school , and then I drove back to the house , so sick at heart and full of rage that I drove past it . <p> Ruth was waiting on the porch . " Daydreaming ? " she said . <p> I went on up and into the kitchen , where Janet sat drinking coffee . " What ? " she said when I looked at her . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , " Ruth said from the door . <p> " In a minute , " I said . <p> " What happened , " said Janet . <p> I have never been able to get anything past her . When we 'd been married a year , I got into a little hugging-kissing thing with this woman at the end of a party I 'd gone to alone , and when I got home Janet knew the whole thing  --  I do n't mean that she saw lipstick on me or smelled the perfume or anything : she knew from me , from the way I was with her , that something was different . Now she sat there with her coffee and waited for me to tell her . <p> " Maybe I 'm not cut out to be a father , " I said . <p> " Poor baby , " she said . <p> I knew she was right about that , too . I 'm not always a son of a bitch . I said , " All right . " <p> " Did you yell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything . <p> " You did , did n't you . You got on him some more . " <p> " I told him I was sorry , " I said . <p> She stood and poured the rest of her coffee in the sink . " I wo n't have you yelling at him . " <p> " No , " I said . <p> " Good Lord , " Ruth said from the door . " He 's just like you were , son . You could daydream the year away if somebody did n't get after you and get you going . " <p> " Ruth , please , " Janet said . <p> " All right , all right . I 'll be out at the end of the sidewalk . " <p> We both watched her make her way out there in the sunlight . " Patience , " Janet said . It was as if she had said it to herself . <p> I said , " I do n't have any left . " <p> " Ha , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I did n't mean it that way . " <p> She got her purse and put it over her shoulder , then stood at the door watching Ruth , who was moving Willy 's bike off the sidewalk . " I hope she 's got you something , I 'll tell you that . Because lately I 've been thinking of taking my son out of here . " <p> " He 's my son , too . " <p> She turned , faced me , and when she spoke it was in a quick voice I did n't know . " We sound like a soap opera , do n't we " <p> " I love him , " I said . " I love you , too . " <p> Ruth called from the sidewalk . " We really ought to get over there . " <p> " I 'll do better , " I said . I did n't want to think about what she 'd do when she 'd had enough of all this . " Please , " I said . <p> She kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cry . " I took chicken out for dinner , " she said . <p> " I 'll make it , " I told her . <p> " Ruth wants to make her southern fried . " <p> We went out and joined my mother , who had opened the car door and was standing there waiting . <p> " Conference over ? " Ruth said . <p> We got in , and we took Janet to work . Nobody said much . Janet kissed me on the cheek and nodded goodbye to Ruth , and we watched her walk up the steps into the building . She likes the job ; that 's one lucky thing . You could see her step getting lighter the closer she got to the door . <p> " Okay , " Ruth said as we pulled away . " So tell me . " <p> " Nothing to tell , " I said . <p> " She hates having me around , I know . " <p> " It 's the whole situation , " I said . " It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I did n't know what she was thinking , but did n't want her to worry about it . " It 's me , " I said . " All right ? " <p> " Well , it 's all going to be better now , " she said . " We 'll have you working again . There 'll be more money . " <p> We went on south , and all the way she talked about what a nice woman Mrs. Wilton was . Not like so many people who have money . Mrs. Wilton looked right at you when she talked , and never put on any airs . She had a great laugh ; and she liked to tell stories on herself . She 'd love me if I got to telling my stories , and all I had to do was relax and be myself . Forget everything and just be who I really was . Her husband was some sort of expert in the antique business , and owned a lot of shops in the area . The house was a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it . <p> I went the long way , so we could go past the school . <p> " I could 've come with you when you took Willy if I knew you 'd go this way , " Ruth said . <p> " I thought I 'd go by , " I said . " Wave to Willy , maybe . " <p> There were a lot of kids out on the playground , four or five groups of them . I slowed down a little to look for Willy , and could n't see him in the middle of all that running and playing , all the colors . <p> " I do n't see him , " Ruth said . <p> I said , " No . " <p> And everything must have been in my voice , because she said , " It 's going to be okay , son . " <p> " I just want him to know I give a damn what happens to him in life , " I said .

It was just what she said it was , too  --  a big old gray clapboard place , more than a hundred years old and , for all its nice tall rooms and big porches and balconies , needing a lot of work . Mrs. Wilton stood in her door as we came up the walk . I was surprised how young she was  --  mid-thirties , maybe . Maybe even younger than that . Pretty , with brown hair and dark eyes , and a tan look to her skin . She held the door open for us , and Ruth said my name to her . We shook hands . I noticed her hands were rough-feeling , almost like a man 's . She was wearing jeans and a sweatshirt . <p> " So , " she said . " Your mother says you 're a good man with a hammer and nails .

" Ruth said . <p> " You were just here yesterday . " <p> " Well , but you had the rugs out on the porch . " <p> " Wo n't take a minute . " <p> My shoes sounded on the hardwood floors as I followed Mrs. Wilton , and Ruth said , " Son , you watch those big heavy shoes on my fresh-waxed floor , now . " <p> My fresh-waxed floor . <p> I never felt lower , never felt smaller , all my life . We went into the library and Mrs. Wilton was talking about her bookshelves and what she wanted done  --  the painting and the crown molding , and the wiring , the track lighting , measurements and kinds of wood and designs , and I just did n't hear most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , could n't really say anything when she asked questions . I heard Ruth running the vacuum in the upstairs hall . <p> " Look , is something wrong ? " Mrs. Wilton said . <p> " Yes , " I said . I was utterly unable to help myself . " All sorts of things are wrong . " And I wanted to go on and say how my mother once had a cleaning lady of her own , and it was n't always like this with us . But I could n't even speak then , for what was going through me , the whole thing , the whole disaster of the last couple of years . <p> " Explain , " she said . <p> I might have shrugged , I do n't know . <p> " Is there something about all this that bothers you ?

" But I was n't able to get the sullenness out of my voice . <p> " You do n't sound like you really want anything . " <p> " What do you expect me to do , " I said . " Jump up and down for you ? " I could n't help myself . It was out of me before I could stop it . This woman who was so comfortable having my mother running a vacuum in her upstairs hallway .

" <p> " You have n't done anything . You can take some notes down , ca n't you ? " <p> I said , " Whatever you say . " <p> " No , " she said . " Well , I guess there is n't any point . " <p> " I 've got an idea what this will take , " I told her . " I can write up an estimate . " But I could tell that something in my voice was putting her off . I could n't look at her . <p> We were standing there hearing Ruth rattling the sweeper on the stairs , coming down . Probably we were both trying to think what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . <p> " If you 'd let me do the work , " I said . " I 'll do a good job . " <p> " Well , write me an estimate , " she said . <p> But it was clear that everything about me had scared her , and she was n't about to go with me . She took a step back and looked me up and down . " The truth is , I 've already pretty well committed to someone else . " <p> Ruth came out then , all smiles . I wished I was dead . She took my hand and faced Mrs. Wilton . " He does n't like to brag about himself , you know . " <p> " Well , you were both very nice to come out , " Mrs. Wilton said . <p> Ruth squeezed my hand . " Yes , well . Next week then ? " <p> " For cleaning , " Mrs. Wilton said . " Oh , yes . Could you come on Tuesday ? " <p> " Tuesday 's fine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of breath . " Are you two finished with everything ? " She looked at me and then back at Mrs. Wilton . <p> " Yes , I 'm afraid we are . " <p> " Well , that was fast . You all are more efficient than I am . " <p> Then nobody said anything . <p> " Well , " Ruth said . " We wo n't keep you another minute . " And she started down off that porch . I felt like a child , being led . Ruth turned and waved . " Bye . " <p> Mrs. Wilton waved back . <p> In the car , we did n't talk . I drove back out to the highway and on toward home , and the wind blew into the open windows of the car . Ruth had lighted a cigarette . Finally she said , " Boy , that was quick . " <p> I could n't think of anything to tell her . <p> " What happened ? " she said . <p> I told her Mrs. Wilton had already taken estimates from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would write up an estimate . I said the woman appreciated my honesty , and that she promised to call me as soon as she knew for certain what she would want done . And there were other jobs , too  --  other jobs might come up . Lies , I know . <p> But what would you say ? I would like to know what you would find to tell her about it ? Would you be able to say that hearing her talk about someone else 's floor as if it was her own had set you off ? That it had made you angry and sick inside , because you had once felt that you liked people and you had always wanted to be kind and you did n't have that anymore , and because it reminded you of all this ? Of where you were and where she was , no more real to Mrs. Wilton than that poor Mexican woman with a cut ear had been to you when you were young and fortunate ? That it had made you see yourself as you were now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this might finally somehow change for the better ? That maybe you can learn to stop being this person you have mostly become  --  that man who makes his wife think of leaving him and frightens his own son ? And if you could find a way to tell her all of this , what would you then say ? If you were that man and she had asked you and you had spoken at all , you had found that you could say one thing , anything , anything at all ? <p>
