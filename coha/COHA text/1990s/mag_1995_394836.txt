Mars has always been an exciting observing target for many reasons . First , it has many Earthlike characteristics such as four seasons , polar caps , dust storms , and clouds . Second , about every two years Mars comes to opposition , rising at sunset and staying up all night , well-placed for telescopic scrutiny . It 's around opposition that the Red Planet appears most striking in the eyepiece . Unfortunately , not all oppositions are favorable and 1995 's happens when Mars is about as far from Earth as it gets . This year 's opposition , termed aphelic because Mars lies at its farthest distance from the Sun ( aphelion ) , happens on February 11 . At that time it lies 63 million miles from Earth and appears only 13.9 " across in the eyepiece . The last time Mars was this small at opposition was on February 24 , 1980 . But do n't let that put you off observing it this winter , for there 's still plenty to see . It 's been 25 months since Mars was this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 . Most of the time Mars hovers between 5 " and 6 " . In that light , even an aphelic opposition is a Godsend . So arm yourself with a 4-inch or larger telescope , eyepieces that yield high power , and a set of colored filters , and prepare to observe the myriad features of the Red Planet . Mars Viewing 101 A successful Mars observing session starts with the right eyepieces and magnification . Because Mars is small , observe at the highest power atmospheric steadiness allows . This will be 30x to 50x per inch of aperture . ( If the magnification is too high , the image goes soft and you see less detail . ) When using my 12.5-inch Dobsonian , I prefer a 4.7mm Ultra Wide eyepiece , which gives 340x . If the atmosphere is steadier , I use a 7mm Nagler coupled to a 2.4x Barlow , which yields 540x . Wide-field eyepieces are especially helpful on telescopes without equatorial mountings because you can let Mars drift through the field of view for a longer period . On motor-driven scopes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as orthoscopics or Plossls ) matter much less . On my 4-inch refractor , for instance , my 8mm and 6mm orthoscopic eyepieces ( combined with a 2.4x Barlow ) yield powers of 192x and 256x and provide good viewing . The key , in any case , is to use the best eyepieces you have . Magnification is important , but colored filters really make the difference when it comes to gleaning Martian detail , which is often subtle and low in contrast . Filters can improve the contrast between a particular feature and the disk of Mars . I recommend a full complement of standard Wratten filters because different colors bring out different Martian features . These are sold through mail-order dealers ( see the advertisements in ASTRONOMY ) and in telescope and photo stores . To observe dark markings , most observing experts recommend a red Wratten #25A . But in small telescopes this filter dims the image too much at high power . In these cases an orange filter ( #21 ) works admirably to improve the contrast of Martian dark markings , while leaving images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one filter , this should be it . Besides observing dark features , you might want to patrol for Martian dust clouds or storms . These show up as bright patches through the orange filter or a #8 yellow one . To spot frost or fogs , use the #58 green filter . Hazes along the morning edge of Mars and cloud features anywhere look like bright blobs when viewed through #38 blue and #47 violet filters . These features can be subtle , so experienced observers flip the filter in and out between the eye and the eyepiece . This helps them " pop " into view . Something in the Air Even with the proper combination of telescope , eyepiece , filter , and magnification , air steadiness will make or break a Mars observing session . If there 's a turbulent air column between your eyepiece and Mars , the planet 's image will " boil " and show less detail than the telescope is capable of revealing . At times unsteady air makes the image look like a fuzzball , devoid of all details . But unsteady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the sources of bad seeing . Tube currents . The moment a warm telescope moves into the cold out-of-doors , air currents start to move within the tube . Hot air flows toward the top of the tube , while cold air sinks to the bottom . This air movement totally obscures details in the image . Tube current problems reveal themselves as slow-moving , swirling blurriness when the image is defocused . To lick this problem , set up the scope outside well ahead of time so it has time to cool . If you ca n't afford to wait , try using a fan to blow air through the tube . This speeds the cooling . Left unattended , my 12-inch Newtonian takes a few hours to reach the same temperature as the air outside . When I use a fan to blow air through the tube , it cools in about 30 minutes . Nearby heat . Something radiating heat between the telescope and Mars generates turbulence . When setting up your telescope , avoid aiming it over warm roofs , chimneys , hot automobile engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On occasion , my own body heat has degraded a planetary image . ) In a defocused eyepiece , turbulence from nearby heat sources looks like a slow-moving river of blurriness . Atmospheric steadiness . Atmospheric bad seeing can shut down useful planetary observing for days . Though not much can be done about Mother Nature 's bad moods , you can stay alert for signs that she is relenting . Sometimes the turbulence is local , such as the area that surrounds an isolated cloud . lust wait it out ; the rest of the sky may be sharp . If you notice fog or haze forming around you , do n't put away the telescope ! Some of the best observing is through light fogs and haze , when the moisture-laden air is ultra-stable . When the seeing does steady , try your hand at drawing Mars . It 's a good way to train your eye and learn the planet 's geography . A drawing also serves as a permanent record of what you see . OK , your first attempts will look crude , but as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more polished and contain loads of information . To get a feel for how large some of Mars ' features are , draw the planet using a 42mm circle . At this scale , each millimeter corresponds to 160 km ( 100 miles ) on Mars . Do n't forget to observe Mars using as many of the filters mentioned above as are useful under the conditions . Regardless of whether you draw or just plain observe , the combination of Earth 's and Mars ' rotation makes it possible to conduct a leisurely " walk " across the Red Planet 's face . Because the Martian day is 40 minutes longer than Earth 's , each successive night you could see an additional 9deg of surface creep onto Mars ' disk on its eastern side . Thus if you observed at the same time each night , in the course of a little over a month , you 'd see all of Mars . A Stroll Around the Red Planet During this apparition , Mars ' northern hemisphere is experiencing local spring . The northern pole is tipping progressively toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shrinking of the north polar cap . Over the coming months , as the Martian northern hemisphere warms toward summer ( which begins late in April ) , the prominent cap will evaporate to a fraction of its size at the beginning of the year . When the polar cap shrinks , clouds often form above it . Use a green , blue , or violet filter to discriminate between the cap and clouds or haze . Also look for disconnected sections of the polar cap as it recedes . During previous oppositions , some observers have even glimpsed a feature called Rima Tenuis , a dark lane bisecting the cap . By May 1st , the north pole will be tipped 20deg toward us ( 25deg toward the Sun ) and the cap will look like a tiny white dot . After the white polar cap , the most prominent feature on Mars is Syrtis Major , near 290deg longitude . This feature , which looks vaguely like the continent of Africa , was one of the earliest recognized on Mars . ( A drawing of Mars made in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas like Syrtis Major were originally thought to be seas like those on the Moon or areas of vegetation . Today we know they are merely rough expanses of dark lava that reflects less light than the bright areas , across which blow drifts of light-colored sand and dust ( see " The Sands of Mars , " June 1993 ) . A bright impact basin ( some 1,700 kilometers in diameter ) called Hellas lies south of Syrtis Major . Further west , near longitude 320deg , is Mare Serpentis , which separates Hellespontus from Pandorae Fretum . These regions have fairly subtle contrast , but to the north lies unmistakably dark Meridiani Sinus ( 0deg ) . Look carefully to see if any linear projections appear coming from this feature . Projections like these still foster the illusion of " canals " on Mars . Why ? The human brain likes to see a continuation of linear features , and when details are subtle enough the imagination can easily run amok . Moving west of Meridiani Sinus , it takes no imagination to see Mare Erythraem ( 30deg ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie the bright Argyre plains , another round impact basin which some observers have mistaken for a polar cap . North of Meridiani Sinus is another dark feature , Niliacus Lacus . Look for its subtle mottling , bordered to the west by a lighter region . Continuing west , we come to Solis Lacus , the " Eye of Mars . " This feature has a dark spot surrounded by bright plains , which creates the illusion of a giant eye staring back through the eyepiece . Look for it just south of the equator . North of Solis Lacus lies one feature you wo n't see through a telescope , the huge Valles Marineris rift valley , discovered by Mariner 9 in 1971 . This canyon system stretches 4,000 km and is 600 km wide . Not too far from here is Mars ' largest volcano , Olympus Mons , which lies on an elevated plain called the Tharsis Bulge and shares the area with many other extinct volcanos . Use blue or violet filters to keep an eye peeled for morning mists and fogs . In 1954 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over these volcanos . The clouds form when warm afternoon air rises over the tops of the volcanos and cools . He dubbed them " W " clouds after their shape . Further on our journey , we come to the vast northern region , a lowland devoid of any features . To the south , however , lie the dark plains of Mare Sirenum ( 150deg ) and Mare Cimmerium ( 210deg ) . There is a nice division between Mare Cimmerium and Syrtis Major that brings us back to the beginning of our tour around Mars . Some Martian features may look different in your eyepiece when compared to the map and drawings seen here . Mars ' face changes with each apparition because its thin but dynamic atmosphere spreads dust all around the planet . It covers and uncovers features continually . You may be lucky enough to witness a sudden dust storm or see cloud activity near the volcanos . Observing Mars night after night is quite a rewarding experience in light of these long- and short-term changes . Enjoy the show it presents to you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . <p>
