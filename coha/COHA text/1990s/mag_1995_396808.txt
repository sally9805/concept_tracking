Last season , I decided to conduct an experiment . I stood in the middle of an intermediate trail , in the direct path of a skier making fall-line turns about 300 yards up the hill . He got within 50 yards of me , and he still had n't seen me . I waved my poles above my head to get his attention . Still no sign that he knew I was there . He did n't see me until I dodged out of his way to avoid getting hit  --  he was too busy looking at his ski tips . This guy was n't unusual . Many skiers do n't watch where they 're going . They do n't use their eyes correctly . And what they do n't see can hurt them . At Mammoth Mountain , where I teach skiing , nearly eight percent of all reported skiing and snowboarding injuries are due to collisions with obstacles or other people . Even in my bright ski school uniform , I 've been hit more times than I care to remember . And there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was agile enough to move out of the way in time . Being aware of other skiers is key to safe , injury-free skiing . And vision is a big part of the awareness picture . Skiers spend a lot of time thinking about how their arms , legs , and torso are performing on the slopes , but not enough about how their eyes are working . In fact , the eyes govern , to a large extent , what the body does . In skiing , your eyes are the " main information-gathering system " as opposed to the other senses , says Dr. Richard Meier , a Reno-based behavioral optometrist who has worked with skiers and snowboarders to enhance their visual skills . Your eyes ' ability to take in and interpret visual data quickly is vital . Skiing poses an unusually high level of visual challenge . The skier 's world is always in flux . A trail becomes more crowded . Snow and weather conditions change , often suddenly ( sometimes you ca n't see at all ) . The sun moves behind the mountain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly , making it easier to miss things you ought to see . " Skiers must have a keen sense of vision , " says Meier , " not only to assess a potentially dangerous situation , like a collision , but also to adjust movements of quick reactions and balance . " Unfortunately , skiers can become so absorbed in the moment  --  working on technique , negotiating an icy stretch of slope  --  that they forget to consider what 's going on around them . Call it Skier 's Tunnel Vision . Think about it the next time you go skiing : Do you use your vision as extensively as you should ? Or do you look down at your tips most of time ? According to Meier , there are several visual components that transmit information to the brain . Visual acuity  --  how keenly you see objects  --  is one . ( People wear prescription lenses to correct poor visual acuity . ) But having 20/20 vision is n't enough . " You 've got to be able to focus quickly , " says Meier , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components are equally important . Peripheral awareness enables you to see things on either side of you . Depth perception allows you to interpret distances , by using both eyes together , so that you can ski around obstacles or pass other skiers . Focus control enables you to focus from one point to another , at a distance and close up . Tracking is the ability to follow an object with your eyes . Skiers are constantly refocusing , first on a distant image like a lift line near the bottom of a run , then up close on a mogul . The quicker your eyes can readjust , the better . If you fix your gaze on one point ( like your ski tips ) for too long , your focus system can become " stuck , " so that when you look at a distant object , your eyes ca n't interpret information fast enough . Believe it or not , being in good cardiovascular condition can actually help you see better . Just like any other muscle in your body , the muscles around your eyes receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better the blood flow to your eyes and the more oxygen they 'll receive . When your eyes are deprived of oxygen , they can fatigue , and tired eyes mean slower eye/foot coordination and consequently delayed reaction time in a potentially injurious situation . There are many ways you can increase your visual effectiveness . Do the following simple exercises consistently , for a few minutes each day . You can also increase your visual effectiveness when you are engaged in other activities  --  driving , biking , walking  --  by thinking about how much information your eyes are providing . Then transfer this awareness to the slopes . * This one helps you change your focus from near to far . Arrange a group of written one-inch-high letters on a wall about 10 feet away , and hold a book 12 inches from your face . Alternate between focusing briefly on the letters on the wall and the letters in the book . * Hold one finger up about 12 inches in front of your eyes . Focus on just your finger in the foreground . Then switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you may see two of them ; this is okay ) . You 'll see that you can either focus on the foreground ( your finger ) or the background , not both at once . As you focus on the foreground , become visually aware of what 's in the background . ( Notice that moving objects in the background are easier to detect than static objects. ) * This enhances peripheral vision . Hold a book 16 inches in front of you . Read the first and last letters as quickly as you can , then scan the room in larger eye movements side to side . * Hold your arms straight out to your sides . Look ahead ( the way you should when you ski ) and slowly bring your hands forward into your peripheral view . Try to expand peripheral sight by being able to see your hands sooner and sooner . * Go outside and scan the horizon , whether it 's a building across the street or a mountain miles away . Do n't try to encompass the whole horizon at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , then another as you would in a crowded room looking for a friend . Try to see each small area clearly , while maintaining an awareness of the whole field . Do n't strain to see . Relaxation is essential to good vision . * Have an erect posture . The correct head and neck alignment will position your head so your eyes look out , not down . Try walking with your head down . Now raise it . Notice how your field of vision expands ( and your balance improves ) when you walk with proper posture . Here are some things you can do on the hill to increase your visual effectiveness ( and to keep from getting hit ) . Scope out runs on the trail map and from the chair before skiing them . Memory also improves visual perception . Breathe evenly . Your eyes need oxygen to function properly . * Look out for situations before they happen . Ski defensively : Do n't assume that others will see you ( wearing bright colored clothing can make you more noticeable ) . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in flat light or snowy conditions . Just as you would when driving a car , slow down until you can see better . * Get plenty of shut-eye . When you 're tired , you do n't see well . Rest plays an important role in enhancing vision on the slopes . EYE CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW Eyewear is an essential component in good vision . The right sunglasses , goggles , or shields can protect your eyes from the elements ( glare , wind , snow ) and make them more comfortable , while enhancing vision . Remember that time you skied under a bright , sunny sky without glasses ? Remember how you had to squint to see ? How your eyes ached and burned by the end of the day ? All good reasons to be nice to your eyes . You want to keep the bad light out , but let the good light in . Look for eyewear with lenses that clock 100 percent of the harmful UV rays . In the short term , exposure to UV can fatigue your eyes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light-reflective environments can cause snow blindness . Long-term UV exposure can result in cataracts . Lenses on eyewear should also transmit an optimum amount of visible light  --  that is , the light that reaches your eye and helps you see . Lenses do n't have to be dark to block UV effectively . Pick a high-contrast tint . Lenses with amber and vermilion tints can make objects appear more sharp and make terrain irregularities more prominent ( and thus more avoidable ) . One way they do this is by filtering out atmospheric blue light , which can cause objects to appear less distinct . Tearing can be a problem , especially for wearers of contact lenses . To reduce tearing , try a wraparound shield design , glacier glasses with side shields , or goggles . Any of the three will also prevent glare from sneaking in the sides . Unfortunately , goggles can impair peripheral vision . Some goggle manufacturers mitigate this problem by using lenses that wrap farther around the side of the face . And do n't wear the same goggles for night skiing that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark . Consider a pair with lenses designed specifically for night skiing  --  either clear or with lighter tints formulated specially for use under night lights . <p>
