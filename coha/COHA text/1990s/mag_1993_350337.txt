MOVIES Peru <P> Along a Murderous Mountain Path <P> You Only Live Once <P> Written and directed by Marianne Eyde <P> WITH ITS FOUNDER JAILED more than a year ago and many of its leaders captured , the Shining Path insurgency is badly crippled . But to Peruvian officials , Sendero Luminoso remains a frightening specter . Norwegian-born filmmaker Marianne Eyde discovered that after she completed a film about Sendero in September 1992 . For a year , the national film board nervously weighed the $150,000 movie 's " artistic merit , " and Eyde voluntarily screened You Only Live Once ( La Vida Es Una Sola ) for Peru 's top military officers so they could see it was not pro-Sendero . Retired General Sinesio Jarama liked it , he told Eyde , but cautioned , " You 're going to have problems because the film makes you think . " <P> A second board , which routinely hands out ratings to pornographic movies , dallied five months before approving it in September for viewers over 18 .

The insurgency 's effects are seen through the fictional Andean village of Rayopampa . By enticing its young people into their movement and provoking the military , the Senderistas force everyone to take sides , creating deadly divisions . Though the story is fictional , the tragic reality is that similar scenarios mark Shining Path 's 13 years of terror . The film has now opened in Peru , drawing favorable critical reaction  --  but so far few moviegoers . <P> Britain <P> Homeless Nocturne <P> Naked <P> Written and directed by Mike Leigh <P> MEET JOHNNY , THE INTELLIGENT , NIHIListic protagonist of Naked . The first view of him could not be more savage . In a dark , scabrous alley he has shoved a woman against a wall and is raping her . For the next two hours , he stumbles through a London nighttown of despairing , inarticulate souls , watching with embittered eyes and delivering mordant , nonstop opinions on everything from Homer to Nostradamus to the Berlin Wall .

In the moral and spiritual sense , Johnny is truly a homeless man . <P> Director Mike Leigh , a veteran of TV , stage and movies , works idiosyncratically , letting plot and character evolve from improvisations and brainstorming sessions with his cast . Over a period of weeks , a taut shooting script emerges . The result is depressing and uncompromising . In Britain Naked 's unredeemed hostility is straining the loyalty of Leigh 's many admirers . In Cannes , however , the film won him the Best Director award this year , and David Thewlis , who is brilliant as rotten Johnny , was named Best Actor . Life for Leigh 's lower-class mates is nasty and brutish ; women are doormats and men are misogynists . The director does not ask for sympathy for Naked 's characters , and the audience feels none . Once met , though , Johnny can not be forgotten . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Upamanyu Chatterjee ; Penguin India ; 303 pages ; $8
