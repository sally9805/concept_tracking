Robert was fired for downloading porn from the Web . And he 's not alone . More businesses are monitoring Internet use and disciplining abusers . Headnote Are you at risk ? // " I 'M AFRAID WE have no choice , " Robert 's supervisor began . " You 're fired . " Robert ( not his real name ) knew his job was on the line , but the news still came as a blow . For five years he 'd worked as a technologist for a state agency . Robert had a solid reputation , a wife of 15 years , and four children . Now he had been fired for surfing the Internet . Several months earlier , Robert had begun visiting sexually explicit Web sites after work hours . It became a habit and then an obsession . Before long , Robert 's supervisor summoned him into her office and told him she knew he 'd been visiting pornographic sites . She warned him that if it happened again , he could be dismissed . Within a few months , Robert was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I just could n't control it , " he says today . " With Internet access , suddenly there was this wealth of material that I could get easily-and for free . " For many organizations , access to the Internet 's rich resources has come at a high price . Employers pay the cost in lost productivity , as some workers use their " free " Net access to shop , chat , pay bills , play games , or even download sexually explicit material . For employees like Robert , misuse of the Net can cost them their jobs . Robert 's story may be extreme , but it 's not unique . According to a PC World survey of top executives at zoo companies , one in five firms has disciplined employees for improper Internet use-from taking away their surfing privileges to taking away their livelihood . Photograph // In fact , one-third of the companies we contacted monitor where their employees go on the Net . Another 12 percent plan to begin this kind of monitoring in the next 12 months . In addition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monitor than their small and midsize counterparts . But watchful eyes are n't lurking in every corporate boardroom . More than half of the executives we surveyed are opposed to peering over their employees ' cybershoulders . Their primary reason for not monitoring ? Concern over employees ' rights . // PC WORLD PHONE SURVEY // PC WORLD PHONE SURVEY // When it comes to Internet surveillance , corporate America is clearly divided . But better play it safe : Remember that whatever you do on the Internet-from downloading files to visiting sites to sending e-mail-someone may be watching . FROM WIRED TO FIRED INAPPROPRIATE INTERNET USE onthe job is fast becoming a major problem , concurs Richard Power , spokesperson for the Computer Security Institute , an information security consulting and training firm in San Francisco . " People are getting fired for this all the time . " Repeated visits to adult-oriented Web sites are the most common cause for Internet-related job dismissals . But employees have also been fired for shopping , gambling , or chatting online . In our survey , we uncovered nine companies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we found these notable cases : * Four employees at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico were fired between late 1996 and early 1997 for surfing adult Web sites on the job . Ten others were disciplined during the same period for using the Net for online shopping and other personal reasons . Similar crackdowns occurred at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in Livermore , California , and Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque , New Mexico . * An employee of a Southern California aerospace engineering firm who was working as a contractor for NASA was terminated earlier this year for spending too much time in an Internet forum on home repairs . * Six employees at an Electronic Data Systems site in Troy , Michigan , were fired earlier this year for abusing their Internet privileges . The discharged workers included one highly regarded systems administrator who , despite several warnings , made 15,000 visits to the same adult Web site in just one month . Companies that monitor Net usage often have big investments to protect . To find out how their workers are using that investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technology Net Access Manager or Net Partners Internet Solutions ' WebSense , which can keep track of the sites people visit and the material they access . ( See " I Spy : Tools for Corporate Intelligence " for an overview of Internet monitoring software . ) Ironically , by monitoring Internet use and disciplining abusers , companies contend that they 're protecting employeesparticularly when it comes to potential sexual harassment in the office that can arise from downloaded pornography . THE NEED FOR MONITORING ACCORDING TO OUR SURVEY , nearly 58 percent of employers who monitor their staff 's Internet travels do so to crack down on recreational use ; 47 percent hope to put an end to downloads of pirated software ; and exactly one-third want to avoid sluggish Internet connections due to recreational browsing or excessive downloads . But experts warn that the biggest problems resulting from inappropriate Internet surfing are legal liabilities . " Most companies have n't fully realized the potential for liability that the Internet poses , " says Albert Gidari , a partner in the Seattle law firm Perkins Coie who focuses on Internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the workplace can mushroom into an expensive , embarrassing sexual harassment suit , Gidari adds . Some companies use monitoring software almost exclusively for preventing charges of sexual harassment or fostering a hostile workplace . For instance , the 6ooo Internet users at National Semiconductor 's worldwide offices are monitored randomly to ensure they are n't visiting adult-oriented Web sites , according to Dick Wilson , vice president of worldwide human resources for the Santa Clara , California , chip maker . " Our MIS people take a random sampling once a month to see if any users are visiting sites that we know have offen- , sive material , " Wilson explains . " If we find an employee is going to any of these sites , we notify that person 's manager . " Simply monitoring Internet usage is n't enough , explains Ed Cavazos , senior vice president and general counsel of Interliant , a data network/Internet service provider in Houston . A company is at risk if it does n't clearly notify employees that downloading or viewing sexually explicit materials will not be tolerated . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supervisors are aware that their employees are visiting adult-oriented Web sites but fail to wam or discipline them , Cavazos adds . But pornography is n't the only Internet abuse that should flash a warning light to employers . <p>
