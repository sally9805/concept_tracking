<p> Economy uses underclass <p> I do n't know if socialism is the answer , but I do n't think capitalism is such a wonderful system , either . And , anyway , it is practiced with dishonesty in this country . <p> We do n't have a pure capitalistic system here , we manipulate the system in favor of the owners and employers . <p> Part of capitalism is that when labor gets scarce , wages go up . But here in the United States , we circumvent that by importing immigrant labor - usually people willing to work for very low wages - and then when that group and their children become assimilated , we import more impoverished immigrant workers . <p> Capitalism not only needs , but it could n't exist as it 's practiced , without a largely uneducated underclass with no real likelihood of escaping their class . <p> If too many seek an education in order to escape their status , then the bars/requirements are raised - what it takes to get a good job becomes tougher to accomplish and thus more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies , business practices and laws that tweak it , usually in favor of the rich or those who intend to get rich . <p> And if a subtle tweak is n't sufficient , then this country has a long history of blatant manhandling its capitalism , designed to create a favorable condition in favor of labor or of low prices , or in favor of many making a profit instead of a few powerful people taking the lion 's share . <p> It kills me to hear people crowing about what a splendid system our capitalism is . Capitalism is America 's religion - not what it practices , but what it says it practices . <p> Wayne Holton , Houston <p> Some students are violent ones <p> Lest we forget , for well over a decade the media have been relentless in crucifying public school administrators and teachers for meting out any and every form of discipline to students . Everything from corporal punishment to isolating students for poor behavior was considered cruel and unusual punishment . <p> Year after year , school districts were bombarded with lawsuits from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell their children how to act , dress , etc . <p> More often than not , the courts sided with the parents until , eventually , school districts across the nation got the message : Discipline was out , students ' rights were in . <p> I read with great angst the article " Girl sues Tyler ISD over alleged attacks " ( Metropolitan , June 9 ) , about the student suing for alleged attacks that took place over two years . The lawsuit refers to schools as " snakepits of violence , " yet it is not the schools which are violent . However , many of the youth are . <p> This problem begins at the elementary level when children are defended by parents for every imaginable kind of behavior , including lying , stealing , cursing , cheating and disrespect to any kind of authority . <p> Children in elementary school know and will tell you there is nothing you can do to them . And , basically , they are right . <p> The parents of this girl would make a bigger impact if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . <p> Sondra K. Pickering , Houston <p> No ' average ' bottom line <p> The Chronicle 's Page one listing of top executive salaries for Houston CEOs made for interesting reading ( " Harvest of gold , " June 7 ) . I noted there were only 16 of these corporate leaders who make more money than Jeff Bagwell , the Astros ' first baseman . Parents should evidently put less emphasis on MBA degrees for their children and more on their batting averages . <p> Otto W. Glade , Houston <p> Colombia 's security issues <p> The June 4 Editorial page , " In Colombia : More than mere lip service needed for democracy , " was correct to highlight the strengths of the Colombian democracy , demonstrated on May 31 by a record voter turnout in the first round of the presidential election , and by calling America 's attention to the complexity of the problems that Colombia is facing . <p> However , the editorial was totally wrong to describe the Colombian armed forces as " brutal and corrupt right-wing counternarcotics forces . " By policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by the Colombian security forces to defeat drug trafficking and terrorism has been done within the framework of the rule of law , as it should be . <p> The cases of violations of human rights , which have at times involved members of our security forces - but certainly not the institutions themselves - have been , are being and will continue to be thoroughly investigated , judged and punished by the proper Colombian authorities . <p> Roberto Serrano Avila is the consul general of Colombia in Houston . <p> Leave bankruptcy laws be <p> Most economists argue that our bankruptcy laws are the single most important reason for the rapid economic rise of the United States . These laws empowered small businesspeople to take risks . Now , powerful lending lobbyists have convinced Congress to protect their indiscriminate clients ' bad credit decisions by changing those laws . <p> The winners will be big business , big banks and the re-election war chests . The losers will be small businesses , the economy and anyone living from paycheck to paycheck who loses their job . <p> Those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Great Depression and then take a quick look at Japan 's remarkable 5.3 percent current quarter economic slump , reported $ 300 billion in bad bank debt and the financial catastrophes in Korea , Indonesia and Russia . <p> Don Carpenter , Houston <p> Restore states ' rights now <p> Our fellow Texan , Bill Rinko-Gay , was right on the mark with his June 10 Outlook statements that the federal government has gone far beyond its constitutional authority , to the detriment of both the individual and all 50 states ( " When I 'll stop throwing away my GOP junk mail " ) . I wonder why governors of all 50 states and their attorneys general have n't come together in a class action suit to regain the powers given states and individuals in the 10th Amendment of the Bill of Rights ? <p> Obviously , the suit would win nine to zero because there is no Constitutional confusion on this issue . As it is , the purposeful intrusions by the feds since the presidency of Lyndon B. Johnson have divided Americans into two incompatible camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , and the other which is encouraged to demand too much . <p> The latter group , projected to become 70 percent of the population in the coming century , will completely alter the outcome of majority rule unless states ' rights are restored . <p> Joyce King , Houston <p> Puerto Rican statehood ? <p> Thanks to the Chronicle for your coverage on the political situation in Puerto Rico and on the 15 prisoners of conscience ( " As ' quirk ' of history , Puerto Rico struggles in quest for statehood , " May 31 , and " Prisoners of conscience ; Despite acts of violence , 15 Puerto Ricans who want their homeland independent say politics keeps them locked up , " June 7 , Page one ) . I thank you for serving as a beacon of uncensored information . <p> Over the past 100 years since the United States invaded Puerto Rico , no one on the mainland has wanted to talk about Puerto Rico - despite the fact it has the power to change the U.S. flag if it becomes America 's Spanish-speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under siege , with the U.S.-imposed U.S. citizenship and the almighty dollar serving as the opium , just like that with which Britain sought to enslave the Chinese people . <p> Only by accurately informing the American and Puerto Rican public will it become clear that statehood is a really bad idea for both Puerto Rico and America . <p> Javier P. Berrios , Houston
