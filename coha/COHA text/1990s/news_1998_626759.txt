<p> One-person plays have been a theater staple for years - but lately , these solo voices have swelled into a chorus . <p> The proliferation of monodramas is apparent in Houston this month , with seven either on the boards now or opening soon . <p> A major factor in this summer surge is Theater LaB Houston 's Fringe Theater Festival , which is presenting three solo shows , beginning with Tim Miller 's Shirts and Skin , opening Wednesday . The LaB 's series will continue with Jill Morley in True Confessions of a Go-Go Girl , opening June 24 , and Ntozake Shange in Ellington Is Not a Street , July 10 . <p> Stages is hosting Rob Nash in his latest solo comedy , Freshman Year Sucks ! , beginning Thursday . Keith Antar Mason is currently performing his In My Living Condition at Renaissance Performing Arts Center , while gay activist Ray Hill plays a Wednesdays-only gig in his The Prison Years at the Little Room Downstairs . Tony-winner Melba Moore brings her Sweet Songs of the Soul to the Ensemble , opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seasons past drew on famous figures . Hal Holbrook set the standard in the 1960s with his Mark Twain Tonight ! - though that was less a play than a flexible re-creation of Twain on the lecture circuit , allowing Holbrook to vary his program from Twain 's writings . Playwright William Luce perfected the form of biographical monodrama with a string of works , from The Belle of Amherst ( starring Julie Harris as Emily Dickinson ) to Barrymore ( with Christopher Plummer as John Barrymore ) . <p> Most recent solo outings , however , have been autobiographical works , recounting the experiences or expressing the concerns of their author/performers . <p> Given the high cost of producing theater today , the abundance of solo acts is understandable . A one-person show is less expensive , and travels more easily , than any production of a play or musical . A particular appeal for performers is that solo shows allow an actor to work without waiting to be cast in a production . <p> Miller is one of the best-known performance artists , partly because of his notoriety as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sued successfully to get their 1990 National Endowment for the Arts grants reinstated after they were revoked under political pressure . Miller 's latest , Shirts &; Skin , is adapted from his recently published memoir of the same title , describing his journey through life as a gay man . <p> " This one is kind of unusual , " said Miller , " because of the process of putting it together . I 'd taken all my previous shows and worked them into my book , rewriting everything to live on the page . Then I wanted to pull sections from the book and turn them into performance versions . It 's an opportunity to pull out the most important , juiciest , sexiest narratives . The show is a sampler of the first third of the book - my ongoing inquiry about growing up and becoming human as a queer man . " <p> Miller has witnessed an explosion of solo performance since he began doing his shows in the early 1980s . <p> " No one was doing them 15 years ago . It was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solo performers now . About 100 theaters have solo pieces up . It 's an interesting form , but it has its limits . The question is ' whose work will be strong enough and persistent enough to sustain interest ? ' In some ways they are economically motivated , because this is a way for writers or performers to take power over their own creative life and not wait for a job to happen . <p> " They 've also become popular at a time when lots of people want to make their identities present in society - so we have queer performance , Latino performance , and so on . What intrigues people is that it 's an intimate form that connects . I 've performed in England , and there they see these monologues as typical of the American fascination with the self , the un-British revealing of all one 's secrets . " <p> Miller has done about 11 solo pieces ( " depending on how I count " ) , culminating in this latest , premiered last fall . He also teaches in the graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensemble pieces . <p> " The good thing about solo work is the audience becomes the other performer . There 's an intimacy , a collusion . It 's a form where the performer acknowledges the presence of the audience , that they are part of the event . " <p> Miller performs Wednesday through Sunday at Theater LaB , 1706 Alamo . Also in the LaB 's Fringe Festival will be Jill Morley in True Confessions of a Go-Go Girl , June 24-27 , and Shange in Ellington Is Not a Street , July 10-12 . For ticket information , call 713-868-7516 . <p> Less an autobiography than a personal response to contemporary issues and events , Mason 's In My Living Condition was created as a reaction to the Rodney King case , the 1992 acquittal of policemen who beat King and the ensuing riots in Los Angeles . <p> " It got started on April 29 , 1992 . When I heard the words ' not guilty ' in relationship to those cops , I knew I had to speak out about what happened on that day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community healer and storyteller . It made me totally invest in making life better for young black men in America , " Mason said . <p> The Los Angeles performance artist heads a performance group called Hittite Empire , for which he writes and directs productions . <p> First performed at San Francisco 's Solo Mio Festival in 1992 , Living Condition also has played in New York and Mexico City . In past presentations , it also has involved the participation of a dancer ; the Houston run is the first time Mason performs it alone . <p> The show has continued evolving , with Mason encompassing other events , including the Abner Louima case in New York City , in which police officers were charged with beating the Haitian immigrant in a police car and sexually assaulting him with a wooden stick in a station house bathroom . <p> " This thing in Jasper ( the racially motivated slaying of James Byrd ) has become part of it now , too , " said Mason . " I 've interviewed people connected to each incident . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found out about each of these things , how the news hit me . <p> " I embody different characters along the way . The narrator is an Afro-centric professor , Dr. Spook , the love child of Bill " Bojangles " Robinson and Aunt Jemima . " <p> The immediate and intimate connection of live performance is crucial to Mason . <p> " We 're more concerned with the sacred space , the public space where you can relate to others and the world . It 's the place for discussion and debate . <p> " The great thing ( about solo performance ) is that if you have a great story to tell , people are generous in listening and experiencing it . People have told me they feel like it 's a one-on-one conversation . That connection is important to an audience . " <p> At the same time , Mason acknowledges the challenge of holding the stage alone . <p> " You learn respect for the actor . " <p> Mason performs Thursdays-Sundays through June 28 , at Renaissance Performing Arts Center , Suite 308 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built a career on solo performance with his series of " dysfunctional " comedies , including 12 Steps to a More Dysfunctional You , seen here and around the nation in recent years . <p> Nash switches gears with his new show , Freshman Year Sucks ! , about a group of friends in a boys-only parochial high school . Loosely based on his experiences at Houston 's Strake Jesuit College Preparatory , the show launches Nash 's Holy Cross Quadrilogy - yes , there will be a show for each year of high school . <p> Freshman has played in New York , Los Angeles , Atlanta and Austin . " Instead of just doing six characters ( as in the Dysfunctional shows ) , I do 26 . It 's less about talk and more about action . <p> " It 's the story of boys finding their personhood , their manhood . Learning that - with their parents and teachers and school a bit out of touch - their friendship is the best thing they have going for them . The ( show ) is set against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a freshman . It 's the end of the disco era , beginning of the Reagan years and we 'd just found the word for AIDS . " <p> Yet Nash does not plan to stick to a realistic time frame for the remaining chapters of his high school saga : Sophomore Slump will be set in 1992 , Junior Blues in 2013 , and Senioritis in 5455 . Each chapter will find the classmates only a year older . <p> " Solo shows are a producer 's dream , " said Nash . " They are very cheap . They 're also fun and novel , a chance to showcase talent in a place like L.A. But it 's possible to tire of the many autobiographical monologues , when the people do not have very interesting stories to tell . So I 've fictionalized a lot in this show ; I 've embellished . " <p> For Nash , the advantages and disadvantages of going solo are one and the same . <p> " It 's that it 's all up to me to make it new and fresh every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and material . I 'm a one-man band both onstage and off - I do a lot of producing , distributing flyers , making calls . I 'd like to have more time to write and have a life . " <p> If one is successful in the solo field , Nash reports , you can earn a living at it - " just barely . " <p> Nash performs Thursdays-Sundays through July 12 , at Stages , 3201 Allen Parkway ( 713-52-STAGE ) . <p> Tony winner Melba Moore had an unusual answer when asked about the catalyst for her creation of her one-woman show : " welfare . " <p> Moore explained that her crisis began in 1991 , when her husband initiated a messy divorce . <p> " I suddenly found myself in a situation of all-out war , " said Moore of this personal disaster , which left her broke and out of work . <p> With solid Broadway credentials including Hair , Timbuktu and her Tony-winning role in Purlie , Moore fought to get her career on track again , working in cabaret . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear you talk . So between songs , I 'd stand up and start talking . That began to grow into a scripted show . " <p> While acting in a production of From the Mississippi Delta in Florida , Moore seized the opportunity to try out her solo show . She 's been touring and refining it ever since and plans to hire songwriters to add original music and lyrics . <p> " I start with my childhood and talk about coming from a musical family , with my mom a professional singer . It 's about the legacy of being in this industry . More than half the time I 'm singing . Going back to childhood gives me a chance to do numbers I heard growing up , like Stormy Weather . I talk about going to college and majoring in music , which lets me do some classical style . I touch on my theatrical credits and also my recording career , which lets me do some disco numbers . There also are some religious songs . So it 's a variety of styles , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels that coming back to performing in such a personal project makes an important statement . <p> " If you 've been cut off from your work for awhile , it makes a good showcase - lets people know you 're here and what you can do . And since so much today is big slick productions , I think the intimacy of this form is a welcome change . " <p> The disadvantage of going it alone , Moore said , comes in the sheer nuts-and-bolts realities of self-protection . <p> " I was a novice at learning to book myself , how to negotiate . You 'd be surprised at the shenanigans you can run into - like people who do n't want to pay you after you 've performed . " <p> No business like it , is there ? <p> Moore will perform June 25-28 , at the Ensemble , 3535 Main ( 713-520-0055 ) . <p> Hill , Houston activist , talk-show host , " and general rabble-rouser " ( according to his press release ) , performs his autobiographical Ray Hill - The Prison Years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Little Room Downstairs , 2326 Bissonnet ( 713-523-0791 ) .
