My daughter said she 'd found God on a farm in New Mexico . She wrote this on postcards , in the looping handwriting of a child , though she was nineteen and had seen her share of trouble . <p> " It 's not a cult , " Laura wrote . " The land is beautiful and the roads are smooth . In the fields there 's corn  --  tiny husks , green and perfect-shaped . God planted them . He built the roads . There 's so much I never understood . " <p> " God does n't build roads , " I wrote back . " People do . Mexican workers and kids without college degrees . Come home now and I 'll take care of you . " <p> She 's my only child . In my room , above the desk , hangs a painting she made for me when she was a girl .

" <p> I brought her first postcard to Kit Jernigan , the Presbyterian minister who lives next door . He was seated at his desk , reading , shoulders stooped , his red beard dipping toward the pages . <p> " This is n't good , " Kit said . <p> " What should I do ? " <p> " You can wait . Often they come home after a short while . They get tired and miss their families . " <p> " And if she does n't ? " <p> " You can try to have her rescued . " <p> " Kidnap her ?

He put down his reading glasses . <p> " Are you telling me I should kidnap her ? " <p> " I 'm not telling you anything , " he said . <p> I 'm fifty-two years old , and have spent a good part of my life alone .

I stopped going to confession when I went overseas , and in Munich , in 1962 , I drank beer and ate sausage on Good Friday . Now , every few years , I go back to Christmas Mass and just watch . I listen to the voice of the priest , to the gentle rustling of men and women in their pews , clean-scrubbed and reverent on their holy day . <p> Ruth and I did n't baptize Laura ; it seemed hypocritical to do so . But later , after Ruth had died and Laura was in trouble , I wondered about our faithless home , and about the non-believing world we live in  --  thought maybe if I 'd taken Laura to church , pretended I was someone I was n't , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ended up on a farm two thousand miles from me , hoping to find meaning in her life . <p> In the attic , I kept a huge stack of books on parenting . Attachment and Loss ; The Making and Breaking of Affectional Bonds  --  more advice than I knew what to do with . I used to read these books at night , in the years following Ruth 's death , as if being a parent were a subject I could study , as if the reading itself were protective . <p> AIDS was in the news . Laura had been staying out late with troubled boys , stringy-haired kids who skulked in the alleyways in scuffed-up cowboy boots , liquor heavy on their breath . <p> I found Laura in her bedroom when I came home from work . That morning , I 'd left her a newspaper article on safe sex . She was fifteen . Already I was corresponding by mail . <p> She had a large bowl of paste in front of her and was building a pelican out of papier-mache .

" The world sucks , " she said . <p> She leaned over her soggy bird . Her legs were pale and hairless , her knees pressed hard against the floor . Around her left ankle was a bracelet of beads ; a Tunisian rug , a gift from her mother , hung fiat against the wall . A kimono lay carelessly over her wicker chair . It blew in the breeze , casting ribbons across her pale face , my daughter with her kimonos and saris , with her Indian beads , with her James Dean posters and bandannas and SAVE THE RAIN FORESTS buttons . Her patched-up panda lay on the bed , and beside it , on the nightstand , was her diaphragm case . She revered Gandhi and loved Elvis . She was a mishmash of likes and dislikes ; and I was her father , fumbling and mute , following her around the house like a ghost , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , " life was easy .

" I reached out and took her hand ; her fingers were bony and vulnerable . " If you died , I 'd be alone in this world . I 'd have absolutely nothing to live for . " <p> She looked up at me , and for an instant her face softened , and in her eyes I saw the weight of my needing her , of my asking her to be happy for me . <p> She pulled her hand away .

" <p> " You have an answer for everything , " I said . <p> " What 's that supposed to mean ? " <p> I leaned toward her . " It means I care about you . It means I want to make sure you 're all right .

She wanted to watch us eat . <p> " I hate Thanksgiving , " Laura said . It was the two of us now , and I 'd burnt the turkey . I wore a brown tweed jacket and a tie , as if we had company , as if this were a date . In the silver hoops of Laura 's earrings , I could see the reflection of cranberries . <p> " It 's a disgusting holiday , " Laura said . " We ripped off the Indians . " As a child , she 'd played Pocohontas in the school play . She 'd brought home husks of corn and painted the kernels red and orange , planting them in the garden , hoping to grow maize .

" <p> She stared at the bird , splayed out on its back like a baby . <p> " Your turkey 's getting cold , " I said . <p> " I 'm a vegetarian now . " <p> " What 's that supposed to mean ? <p> " I 've decided this instant to become a vegetarian . " <p> " You ca n't just decide . I wanted us to eat together , for everything to be perfect .

" Sweetie , " I said , and reached out to touch her . Her shoulders were hunched over and her chest heaved . <p> " What am I going to do ? " she said . " It 's just me now  --  me and this big world out there . " <p> " I 'm here . We have each other . " <p> She pinched her arm . " Look at me , I 'm starting to grow fat . " <p> " You 're beautiful , " I said . <p> " Would you think that if you were my age ? If you were a guy in my high school , would you even bother talking to me ? " <p> " I 'd love you , young or old , " I said . <p> She looked up at me . Big tears the color of her earrings dripped down toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " I 'm such a fucking burden .

" <p> " You are my life , " I said . " You 're the only thing that matters to me anymore . " <p> She left home the first time when she was seventeen . I 'd agreed she could be on her own if she finished high school . She graduated , barely , and skipped commencement . A week later she drove cross-country in a pink polka-dotted van , then spent a year in Boise , Idaho , where she raised horses for a man she 'd met at a Denny 's . He drove a Kawasaki , and had been sitting in the booth next to hers , smoking cigarettes and dropping the ashes by her feet . <p> " His name is Axel , " Laura said . She was calling from a pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tapes ? " <p> " What does he do ? " I asked . <p> " He owns horses . " Beyond her , through the static , I could hear the sounds of tires screeching . <p> " Do you know him ? " <p> " Sort of . I do now . " <p> " He could kill you , " I said . <p> " Anyone can . I heard about this man who shot his wife and kids . Rich guy  --  jacket and tie , the whole bit . Came home one night and just blew them away . " <p> " His name is Axel ? " <p> " Dad , " she said , but then her change ran out . <p> It was the fall of 1990 , and the country was preparing for war . You could see it in the polls , and on the faces of the newscasters and the people in government . Laura had left an address where I could reach her , and I sent her messages on the back of postcards . <p> " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote . " What do you think of that ? " <p> " Send money , " she wrote back . <p> I thought it over . I could try to starve her and make her come home . But who knew where she might end up , my daughter with nothing but a tattered duffel bag and a horse breeder she 'd met on the side of the highway . I phoned Kit and asked him for advice . Then I wired her five hundred dollars . <p> Now , with Laura on the farm , I drove to the city , to a huge postcard warehouse on Bleecker Street . I found Ansel Adams photos , and cards with Rembrandts painted on them . There were New Age postcards ; crystals in dizzying patterns ; holograms ; black-and-white snapshots from the Thirties and Forties ; Slavic men in fur hats standing by pickle stands . <p> I bought Laura postcards of horses  --  sleek stallions , Arabian mares , Stevie Cauthen riding Secretariat , a photo finish at the Belmont Stakes . I 'd taken Laura riding when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote , drawing the words carefully in felt-tip pen . " Wild horses could n't drag me away/Wild , wild horses we 'll find them someday . " <p> " Why are you sending me these notes ? " she wrote back . This was a pictureless card , bought with a stamp already printed on it . " That 's not a father-daughter song , it 's a song for lovers . Besides , I do n't like the Stones anymore , they do nothing for me . P.S. , " she wrote , " it 's ' ride them '  --  ' We 'll ride them someday . ' You got the lyrics wrong . " <p> I sent her a card with Miss Piggy on the front . Miss ' Piggy was holding a briefcase and wearing curlers and yellow sunglasses . She looked like Liz Smith . " Mike Tyson squeezed all eight of my teats , " Miss Piggy said . " Clarence Thomas stole my panties , and it 'll cost big bucks for me to tell what happened at the Kennedy compound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I wrote . " Awful people are being appointed to the Court . You 're isolated , Laura . There 's a big crazy world crying out for your help and you 're ignoring it . " <p> " I 'm ignoring what 's worth ignoring , " she wrote back . " Ron 's the only thing that matters and I 'm not ignoring him . We love each other here  --  we love Ron and he loves us  --  what more does the world need ? If you cared about me , Daddy , if you loved me , you 'd want to know how I was doing , you would n't be writing me about politics . " <p> " Of course I love you , " I wrote . " Tell me anything , darling . I just want some correspondence between us , I want to know what 's on your mind and in your heart . " <p> " Ron 's in my heart , " she wrote . " He makes me happy  --  happier than any man ever has or ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she was tiny and fig-like , I could n't imagine her having an opinion . She 'd learn words and sentences . But a mind of her own . She grew bigger  --  slow , imperceptible  --  until she was gangly and pubescent , until she was who she was , and I tried to pinpoint the moment she stopped needing me , the moment she so much did n't need me I wondered if she ever did . <p> She got chicken pox and strep throat . I worried about rheumatic fever . She sneaked candy and soda into the house . She hid Tootsie Roll lollipops under her mattress . Her arteries were filled with cholesterol ; sugar ran through them , and Red Dye #2 . She drank too much beer and wrecked a car . A bong sat on her bureau , a turquoise bong in the shape of a woman 's body . She asked me to grow pot in our garden . " We can control what 's in it , " she said . " Who knows what 's in the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when she was out , I listened for the sound of sirens . I waited up to hear a key . I asked her what she did with her friends , wanting to know what I should n't have wanted to know , because knowing only made me stay up longer . <p> I thought about nature versus nurture . I wondered which one let me off the hook . <p> I had slapped her once , a quick angry stroke across the face . Again I wondered  --  wondered if that was the reason she went wrong , if finally I could blame myself . <p> These are the questions I asked : How much television ? What kind of food ? Should I help her with her homework or hope she perseveres ? The day she was born , Ruth and I opened a bank account in her name . We added cash every year , so someday she could pay for college . When she left home at seventeen , I refused to give her the money . " Come back , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was in Boise , I suggested junior college . She was raising horses with a man I 'd never met , and junior college sounded good to me . Now I did n't care about college . I offered her bribes on the back of postcards . " The money is yours , " I wrote . " Come home and get it , use it as you like . Use your own bad judgment . " <p> That day , on the way back from the postcard warehouse , I saw a retarded girl along the New Jersey Turnpike . She was about four , and she stood with her parents at a rest stop . The girl 's face was slack and puffy , her head angled to the side , her gait was uncertain . Down 's Syndrome , I thought . I looked away . <p> This is what you fear . You decide to have a baby . You take care of yourself , you eat the proper food , you pray for the right number of chromosomes . But as I looked back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'd grow older but would never leave home , for a foolish instant I regretted my life and wished I could switch places with her parents . <p> For a time I thought Laura would be an artist . Ruth painted , as did her mother before her , and I myself keep a sketchbook . I sit in the garden when the afternoon is warm and draw what I see . <p> In Laura 's painting , the one that hangs above my desk , a man and a monkey are sitting at an ice cream parlor eating banana splits . The monkey holds a spoon in his hand . Around his neck hangs a bib . Laura painted the picture when she was seven . For three months it hung on the wall of a Howard Johnson 's next to the art of other schoolchildren . These are the words of a parent , I know , but when I look at that painting , at the expressiveness drawn on the monkey 's face , I 'm convinced this is the work of a sensitive soul . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I called Kit and got the name of a deprogrammer . <p> " Have you met him ? " I asked . <p> " No , " he said , " but I 'm told he does good work . " <p> I drove to the man 's house wearing a pin-striped suit and black loafers ; I 'd gotten a haircut earlier that day . I wondered who usually came for this man 's help : divorced parents , alcoholics , fathers and mothers in unkempt clothing . He 'd ask me questions , want details about my life . Already I resented him . <p> He was no more than thirty , and had a full head of auburn hair . His skin was pearly and unwrinkled ; he sported sideburns . How , I wondered , had he gotten into this business ? Did he know someone like Laura ? A girlfriend ? A brother or sister who 'd been lured away ? Maybe he enjoyed other people 's trauma ; here was someone who loved a chase . <p> He had his diploma on the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williamson , " I said . <p> " Call me Ralph . " <p> Ralph . Ron . Everyone had a name like that . <p> " So , " said Ralph . There was crumpled newspaper on the floor . An empty coffee cup , its handle chipped , lay on its side by the carpet . A few feet away sat a soggy tea bag . To my right , three tube socks hung on the spine of a rattan chair . None of them matched . Maybe Ralph was disorganized , maybe he forgot details . He stared at me coolly , his palms folded on his lap . " Where exactly is your daughter ? " <p> " In New Mexico , " I said . <p> " It 's a big state . We 'll need to locate her . " He laid his hands along the edge of the sofa . They were large hands , pink and fleshy , athletic , the hands of a fighter . " This will cost you , Lawrence . I hope you understand . " <p> I looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my first name . <p> " One thing you should know , " he said . " Sometimes the subject does n't come voluntarily . " <p> " The subject ? " I said . <p> " In this case your daughter . " <p> " You mean you 'll have to rough her up ? " <p> " We try our darndest not to do that , Lawrence . Do you remember Carter and the Iranian hostages ? They botched the rescue , the helicopters did n't even get off the ground . On the other hand , there was Entebbe . Entebbe was perfect . " <p> " Entebbe was n't perfect , " I said . " A passenger died in the hospital , and an Israeli soldier was shot to death . " <p> " They were in Uganda , " Ralph said . " Try rescuing someone from Uganda . " <p> " We 're not in Uganda , " I said . " We 're here , in Bergen County . What does Uganda have to do with it ? This is my daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope . " <p> Ralph looked at me smugly . " I was just trying to make a comparison . " <p> At the gym the next day , Kit pumped me with questions . <p> " I did n't like him , " I said . <p> " You do n't have to like him . You just have to trust he 'll do his job . " <p> We were on the track , running abreast . Kit lived alone , he 'd never been married or had children . He cared about Laura , but I was her father . He could manage to be happy without seeing her again . <p> " Sleep on it a while , then trust your instincts . " <p> " What would you do ? " <p> " It 's not up to me . " <p> " Give me a straight answer , " I said . <p> " I do n't have a straight answer , " said Kit . <p> " I 'm having Ron 's baby , " Laura wrote the next week .

You girls are concubines , all of you . " <p> I crumpled the letter and started again . <p> Dear Laura , <p> I 'm very sick . The doctor says I have six months to live . I must see you at once . <p> Love , Dad " I ca n't visit you , " she wrote back . " Ron has forbidden it . But if you 're well enough , you can fly to Albuquerque and meet me at the airport .

I stepped forward gingerly and placed my bag by my feet ; then I took hold of her in my arms . <p> " Daddy , " she said . <p> " Your voice , " I said , " it 's beautiful . " <p> She took a step back . Her blond hair had been cropped short ; she looked like a tomboy . Her biceps had thickened , her veins shone through . I quickly scanned her body . She seemed healthy . There were no bruises , none that I could see . " Dad , " she said , " this is Ron . " <p> A man about forty stuck out his hand ; I 'd thought she would come alone . <p> Ron was a philosopher and psychologist , according to Laura , but to me he looked like a high school gym coach . He was sandy-haired and had a small button nose and a firmly set jaw . His skin was creased and leathery , with a slightly orange , artificial hue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanning salon . He was about six foot three and had a short tree stump of a neck . His Adam 's apple bobbed in his throat . <p> I 'd expected something different . Moses , the Dalai Lama , flowing cape , high forehead , braided hair , furrowed brow . Ron stood opposite me with his hands behind his back . My daughter worshipped a football player . <p> " I need time with you alone , " I said . <p> " We 'll have to ask Ron 's permission . " <p> " Thug , " I muttered . <p> " What ? " said Laura . <p> Ron hesitated for a moment . " You have fifteen minutes , " he said . <p> We went across the terminal , to a darkened lounge with sofa seats , a cross between a restaurant and bar . It was called Prey and Potion , and it looked like an indoor game park , with furs and pelts along the walls , and a long bar with rifles dangling from the ceiling , and a bartender who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A moose head hung from the wall above us . <p> " I thought you were coming by yourself , " I said . <p> " Ron and I are inseparable . Even when I 'm far away , he 's still with me . " <p> " Sounds like a disease , " I said . <p> " Here , " Laura said , " feel my stomach . " She grabbed hold of my hand and pressed it against her . " Soon the baby will be kicking . It 's incredible , there 's been no morning sickness . " She hesitated for a moment . " I hope you 're alive when it 's born . I want you to be a grandpa . " <p> " I 'll be alive , " I said . " Nothing 's wrong with me . " <p> The waiter strutted toward us , crossing a row of rugs , one animal pelt after another . Dark tattoos covered both his forearms . <p> " What 's on tap ?

" He tipped his cowboy hat and walked off . <p> In the back of the lounge two men were playing pinball . Rodeo Ripper , read the neon sign , and I could see purple lights flashing and hear the sound of bells and sirens and automated voices shouting , Lasso him , cowboy kick his butt . <p> I turned toward Laura . " I want you to come home . We can take care of the pregnancy and forget it ever happened . I 'll send you to art school if you 'd like . You used to paint , you know .

" I 'm the happiest I 've been in my whole life . " She dipped her spoon into the tea . <p> " How would Mom feel about this ? What would she think if she were still alive ? " <p> " She 's not alive , " Laura said . " Who cares about Mom ? " <p> " I do . I think about you both all the time .

I did my best , I wanted to say , but the words would n't come . I reached out to touch her , but I grabbed too hard , and in a flash Ron was over , tugging on her in the other direction . There was a frenzy of grunts , not a word was exchanged , just Ron and me pulling on Laura 's arms .

The waiter was standing across from me , and in the background I could hear the automated voices of the pinball machine shouting on . I continued to pray , but I was n't sure what to ask for , and at that moment I knew I 'd become like Laura  --  grown closer to her than ever before , cast off and looking for something .
