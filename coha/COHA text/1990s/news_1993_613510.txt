<p> Randy Blazak stands on a chair in the middle of the crowded terrace outside Cafe Diem and announces that the poetry reading will begin - " Where we wow you with the musings of our local street poets ! " he shouts above the roar of passing cars . <p> He begins reading a poem called " Incapacitated , " which sums up the feelings of some longtime struggling poets : " But mostly I 'm incapacitated because Henry Rollins is on MTV reading poetry and I 'm not ! " The crowd laughs and cheers . <p> The scene harkens to the days when Beat poets read verse in dark clubs and trendy coffeehouses in the late 1950s and ' 60s . Someone in the cafe crowd actually wears a black beret . <p> Once the secret language of artists , poseurs , intellectuals and teenagers working through their angst , poetry has recently blurted into the mainstream . <p> MTV aired a special show called " Spoken Word " last month with musician Henry Rollins , in which young , raw poets ranted about sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie , " Poetic Justice , " features Janet Jackson as a poet reciting works from the distinguished author Maya Angelou . <p> And in the last year , three poetry nights have blossomed around Atlanta - at Cafe Diem in Virginia-Highland , the Liquid Bean on Ponce de Leon Avenue and the Star Community Bar in Little Five Points . <p> As with any renewal of an old love , there are always comparisons to the first time , which means talk of the Beat generation and the whole coffeehouse movement . A new generation seems to want the grit , freedom , excitement and stream-of-consciousness approach of Allen Ginsberg , Lawrence Ferlinghetti and Jack Kerouac . <p> So how can you be avant-garde and retro at the same time ? <p> For Alexa Simmons , a heavily tattooed and pierced poet who reads regularly at the Liquid Bean , it 's all simply a matter of looking forward while tipping a nose ring to the past . She reads a piece she calls " one of the speed freak poems " that tumbles out in true Beatnik form , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1,001 William S. and Hunter hallucinations " gurgling to the top . <p> " I hope that it 's part of a pool of ideas and creative energy that will somehow coalesce into a flowering like we had in the ' 60s , " says the 34-year-old . " I think there are superficial similarities to the Beats - I think what we 're doing is different . " <p> " It 's a different kind of thing entirely than what most people who study poetry would call poetry . It 's more like performance , " says David Bottoms , a creative writing professor at Georgia State University , who says his class on introduction to poetry has remained steadily full for the last decade . " I think what you can gather is there 's a need for this kind of expression . " <p> " I wo n't write my poem till I 'm in my right mind " <p> - Allen Ginsberg <p> Mr. Blazak , a founder of the Cafe Diem readings , says more people are interested in listening to local poetry because they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club scene . Now the coffeehouse is the place to hear and be heard . <p> " It fulfills an image of people 's idea of what a cafe is like , " he says . " The real thing is if you drink enough coffee , you 'll get up and say anything . It 's really a caffeine experience . " <p> The atmosphere at Cafe Diem differs greatly from that of the Star Bar and the Liquid Bean , where there 's more of a rough-and-tumble crowd . Here you 'll find a lot of young , cool cats sipping cappuccino under the starry night . And a lot of young writers screaming things like " I 'm alive and my fist is clenched ! " with eyes tightly closed . <p> Some , however , are unmoved by this soulful display . <p> " It 's not bad , " says T.J. Silverman , 18 . " But sometimes it gets a little outrageous . Last month there was a guy who was ranting and raving about fish . It was kinda scary . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write poems does n't mean you 're a poet , " says Daniel Thompson , 20 . <p> But occasionally , among the people who write poems , a poet does emerge . Everybody could sense an artist at work when Alicia Stallings stood barefoot on the chair and read from her poem , " The Old Woman Laughs at the Love Letters of Her Youth " : <p> Love poems is sweet and nice to hear , <p> But Honey , they ai n't so clever . <p> Love ai n't flowers - they stay put , <p> Or stars - they last forever . <p> Only thing love 's like is an old stray cat , <p> Skittish , but full of fight . <p> Sticks round till it 's shiny and fat , <p> Then just runs off one night . <p> ' Cause love do n't belong to nobody , Honey - <p> It ai n't Man 's best friend . <p> But if you do n't dare name it <p> or try and tame it , <p> It 'll be back again . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kerouac <p> What makes people get on stage and pour out their innermost thoughts to a roomful of strangers ? <p> " Healthy dose of exhibitionism , " says Deadbeat Burt , a poet with a requisite black goatee who co-founded " Howl , " the Star Bar 's monthly reading - named for the Ginsberg poem that helped launch the Beat Generation - with fellow poet Copacetic Chris ( Chris Briedis ) last spring . <p> " Poetry is very real , " he says . " It 's a person at the mike and nothing else . " <p> As if to prove he lacks none of the necessary requirements , Deadbeat Burt ( who refuses to divulge his real name ) presents a few choice poems to the odd group of homeless poets , scruffy students , exotic dancers and street characters assembled at the Star Bar , including a ribald attack on Sen. Sam Nunn ( D-Ga . ) . <p> " Alexander the Great was gay <p> And so was Attila the Hun <p> But they would n't be good enough <p> To serve in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem in a booming , melodramatic voice to the gleeful hoots of the audience . Topicality really brings this house of freaks down . <p> The beauty - and the beast - of Howl is that anything goes . A guy called Wolf , who looks like he could be Neil Young 's grandfather , plays a badly out-of-tune acoustic guitar . <p> Blondie , an exotic dancer from the Clermont Lounge , reads a poem about a fish fry and tells the audience in a raspy voice , " I like to bring happiness - whether it 's shaking my rump or reading poetry . " <p> John Howell , an engineer from Lawrenceville , recites the " Crispin Crispian " speech from Shakespeare 's " Henry V. " <p> You have to employ " the 10 percent rule " when dealing with amateur poetry , advises Ian Fuller , a cook and printer who reads a poem about a brick . " You have to put up with 90 percent crud to get 10 percent golden . " <p> But if the Star Bar crowd can make this distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything with only occasional bursts of obvious enthusiasm . <p> This is no poetry slam , where rowdy audiences give the thumbs up or down to decide whether nervous poets should be thrown to the lions . Here no one even cracks a smile when a guy called the Silver Fox , who 's reading a poem about a frog poet who lusts for a princess , stops midsentence to belch before rambling on . <p> " Nobody but nobody can make it out here alone " <p> - Maya Angelou <p> What the Star Bar needs is a good heckler , like the one they 've got at Liquid Bean . An older guy in a dirty T-shirt and baseball cap scrunches down on a ratty couch in the java house , waiting for the show - " Scream of Consciousness " - to begin . <p> Copacetic Chris , who makes all the rounds in town , is trying to read a straightforward love poem . " She may not love me now . . . " he begins , but the heckler gets there first . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's like an inebriated Greek chorus , forcing the poets and listeners to think about what 's being said . In fact , he 's probably paying closer attention to the readings than anyone else in the smoky room . Most of the audience , which consists mainly of tattooed loveboys and pierced punkgirls with a few street bums thrown in , mills around the counter , sucking on cigarettes or tanking up on iced coffee , cafe au lait and other specialty joes . <p> A young man who calls himself Sage X takes a seat on the stage . " A lot has been happening in the last two months , " he confesses to the crowd . " Got in a car accident , got engaged , been shot at , been told I was a father . " The crowd moans sympathetically . <p> The 20-year-old reads a few poems , trite images of love and life that could have been swiped straight from " Days of Our Lives " : " Elusive are the grains of sands that slip effortlessly through the hourglass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and poetry is how he gets over . <p> " It 's good because you get to release a lot of anxiety , " he says . <p> He believes poetry , like some forms of music , is an ever-present force that 's just being exploited by the media momentarily . " A lot of people made a big deal out of grunge but it 's always been around , " says the Sage . " It was just never mainstream . " <p> And if grunge - last year 's flannel-flapping , combat-booted media darling - can show up in Donna Karan fashion shows , can a poetry Happy Meal be far behind ? <p> " America , that usually only has room for MTV and McDonald 's , now has room for Beat poetry , " says Deadbeat . " I think that 's great . "
