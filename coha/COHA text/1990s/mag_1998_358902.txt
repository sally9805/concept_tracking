Coco Chanel was n't just ahead of her time . She was ahead of herself . If one looks at the work of contemporary fashion designers as different from one another as Tom Ford , Helmut Lang , Miuccia Prada , Jil Sander and Donatella Versace , one sees that many of their strategies echo what Chanel once did . The way , 75 years ago , she mixed up the vocabulary of male and female clothes and created fashion that offered the wearer a feeling of hidden luxury rather than ostentation are just two examples of how her taste and sense of style overlap with today 's fashion . <P> Chanel would not have defined herself as a feminist  --  in fact , she consistently spoke of femininity rather than of feminism  --  yet her work is unquestionably part of the liberation of women . She threw out a life jacket , as it were , to women not once but twice , during two distinct periods decades apart : the 1920s and the ' 50s . She not only appropriated styles , fabrics and articles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with how she dressed herself , appropriated sports clothes as part of the language of fashion . One can see how her style evolved out of necessity and defiance . She could n't afford the fashionable clothes of the period  --  so she rejected them and made her own , using , say , the sports jackets and ties that were everyday male attire around the racetrack , where she was climbing her first social ladders . <P> It 's not by accident that she became associated with the modern movement that included Diaghilev , Picasso , Stravinsky and Cocteau . Like these artistic protagonists , she was determined to break the old formulas and invent a way of expressing herself . Cocteau once said of her that " she has , by a kind of miracle , worked in fashion according to rules that would seem to have value only for painters , musicians , poets . " <P> By the late ' 60s , Chanel had become part of what she once rebelled against and hated  --  the Establishment . But if one looks at documentary footage of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vinegar of the fiery peasant woman who began her fashion revolution against society by aiming at the head , with hats . Her boyish " flapper " creations were in stark contrast to the Belle Epoque millinery that was in vogue at the time , and about which she asked , " How can a brain function under those things ? " Something that Chanel can never be accused of is not using her brain . Her sharp mind is apparent in everything she did , from her savvy use of logos to her deep understanding of the power of personality and packaging , even the importance of being copied . And she was always quotable : " Fashion is not simply a matter of clothes . Fashion is in the air , born upon the wind . One intuits it . It is in the sky and on the road . " <P> It is fitting , somehow , that Chanel was often photographed holding a cigarette or standing in front of her famous Art Deco wall of mirrors . Fashion tends to involve a good dose of smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Gabrielle Chanel 's version of her life involved a multitude of lies , inventions , cover-ups and revisions . But as Prada said to me : " She was really a genius . It 's hard to pin down exactly why , but it has something to do with her wanting to be different and wanting to be independent . "
