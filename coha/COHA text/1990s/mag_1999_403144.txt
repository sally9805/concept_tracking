After last year , you 'd be forgiven for wanting to put most of your mutual funds in a big black bag and plop them into the nearest garbage can . After all , as we went to press near the end of 1998 , an appalling 2,611 out of 2,891 diversified U.S. stock funds were underperforming Standard &; Poor 's soo-stock index for the year ( according to CDA Investment Technologies of Rockville , Md . ) . That 's right : 90% of the funds did worse than the market average . What 's more , 335 U.S. stock funds had lost at least 10% of their value ( even though the S &P; 500 was up roughly 22% for the year ) , and 303 foreign stock funds lost 10% or more . So if your portfolio is stuffed full of underperforming mutual funds , you may be itching to dump them . But how can you tell which laggards you should toss ? Let me start by pointing out that most " experts " are far too quick to urge you to sell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lund , the Internal Revenue Service will take at least 20% of your proceeds when you sell . What 's more , you may well be bailing out at the bottom , right before the fund you sell takes off-and the one you replace it with goes down the tubes . That 's why , in most cases , the single best selling advice I can give you is : Do n't . Having said that , let 's look at why so many funds are giving off such a foul smell when you compare them with the S &P; 500 . Although that market index includes 500 of the nation 's most prominent public companies , the 25 largest stocks-giant firms like General Electric , Microsoft , Coca-Cola , Merck and Exxon-now make up 33.5% of the S &P's; entire capitalization . In other words , one-third of the S &P's; value is accounted for by just 5% of its stocks . What 's more , according to Leah Modigliani of Morgan Stanley Dean Witter , all of the S &P; 500 's gross return through November came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Computer ) contributed 12% of the S &P's; rise . " If you 're measuring performance relative to the S &P; 500 , " says Modigliani , " you need to understand that the index has been influenced much more by large stocks than by small ones . " Thus while the S &P; 500 roared back to record heights by late 1998 , 42% of the stocks within the index nevertheless lost money . And , according to the investment research firm Frank Russell Co. of Tacoma , Wash. , while the biggest growth companies rose 36% , the top value companies rose 17% . Meanwhile mid-size stocks rose just 4.5% , and small companies fell 8% . Think about this : If you own a fund that specializes in small stocks or " value " companies trading at low prices relative to their earnings , then your fund manager would be derelict in his duty if he did buy giant , highly priced stocks like Microsoft ( recently priced at 63 times earnings ) or Dell ( at a recent PIE ratio of 68 ) . Expecting a value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like these makes no more sense than expecting Dennis Rodman to stay married in sickness and in health . Says Robert Sanborn , manager of the bargain-hunting Oakmark Fund , which was up " only " 10% in 1998 : " The better a value manager you were , the worse you did in 1998 . " I hate to seem like your elderly aunt shoving a spoonful of castor oil in your face , but if you 're angry at losing money on a small-company or value-stock fund in 1998 , you probably should n't blame the fund manager . You should blame yourself for imagining that your fund could do well in a market that was so hostile to those kinds of stocks . It 's simply unfair to fire your manager for not doing the impossible . Stop obsessing Mind you , I 'm not saying that you should never sell an underperformer . A fund belongs in the garbage can if it has : Underperformed similar portfolios for three years Slammed you with high tax bills Repeatedly raised its expenses Changed to a strategy you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least two of those sad criteria lately : Fidelity Trend and John Hancock Growth ( low returns , shifting strategies ) , and Merrill Lynch Fund for Tomorrow and Pioneer II ( low returns , high taxes ) . If you think your fund might qualify for this list , the first step is to make sure you 've measured its returns fairly . Dig out your fund 's prospectus and annual report , and check to see which benchmarks the manager uses to measure his or her performance . If your fund has a clear style defined by size and price- " small-company value , " for instance-then you can quickly hunt up some comparisons on the Internet . Let 's say you own Baron Small Cap , which was down 8% for 1998 as we went to press . By logging on to www.russell.com or www.wilshire.com ( or simply by calling the fund company and asking for the returns of the Russell 2000 value index or the Wilshire small-cap value index ) , you can see that the small value-oriented stocks that this fund specializes in lost between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll stop obsessing over the fact that the S &P; 500 was up 25% while Baron Small Cap dropped 8% What 's more , short-term returns tell you nothing about what you can expect in the long run . Funds that do well in bull markets stink in bear markets ; other portfolios that thrive when most stocks are dropping will suffer when the indexes rise again . And even the most talented managers who have outrun the market averages over the long term go through dry periods . Ask David Schafer , who runs Strong Schafer Value Fund . From its inception in 1986 through the end of 1997 , Schafer 's fund outperformed the S &P; 500 by an average of 1.5 percentage points annuallybut lagged the index badly in several years along the way . In 1998 , Schafer fell 8% through November . " We 've never had a five-year period without at least one year when we were out of sync with the market and had a lot of explaining to do , " Schafer recalls . " But we 've always come back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key point . How can you know if a fund 's outperformance is the result of the manager 's skill or pure luck ? It can take decades to get mathematical proof that a fund manager is skillful rather than lucky . In fact , by the time his skill can be statistically proved , the manager and most of his clients may well be pushing up daisies . Think of the fund managers who in recent years have been anointed " the next Peter Lynch " - Gary Pilgrim , Garrett Van Wagoner , Shelby Davis and John Bogle Jr. , among others . All these managers ate the S &P; 500 's dust in 1998 . That does n't mean their earlier performance was just luck , but it does show that no one can say for sure that these managers possess true skill . " It takes so long to determine whether outperformance is real or just plain luck , " says Ted Aronson , an institutional money manager at Aronson &; Partners in Philadelphia , " that hiring an active manager is an act of faith . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty to a fund manager purely on whether he or she is beating the market . Since the manager may just be lucky rather than brilliant , you should focus instead on a fund 's more consistent , reliable qualities , such as low expenses , high tax efficiency and a stable investment strategy Precisely because performance is so unpredictable , it 's almost always a mistake to sell a fund after a year or two of bad performance . Dalbar , a Boston fund research firm , studied returns at hundreds of funds in the 14 years from 1984 through 1997 . By comparing the funds ' performance with the amount of cash that flowed in and out of them , Dalbar was able to calculate how much money the average fund shareholder earned over that period . The startling result : While the market rose an annual average of 17.2% during those 14 years , the typical stock fund investor earned only 6.7% annually . That gaping 10 1/2-percentage-point difference comes from the constant pursuit of the next manager who might beat the market-trapping investors in what fund commentator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " By dumping one fund that 's cold and buying another that 's hot , you 're likely to miss out on the recovery of the first investment style-and then get burned when the second style flames out . So if your fund manager 's only sin is to have bought small stocks or cheap stocks , then I 'd advise you to cut him or her some slack . No stock picker will ever make money for you if you do n't stick around until the decisions have a chance to pay off . <p>
