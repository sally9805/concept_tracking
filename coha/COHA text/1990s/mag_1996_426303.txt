A British teen faces death from an illness once linked mainly to cows // UNTIL THE SPRING OF 1993 , VICKY Rimmer was an average Welsh teenager who loved hamburgers , rock music and shopping with friends more than studying for school . " She was 15 and never still , " says her grandmother Beryl Rimmer , 56 . Then , suddenly , the mysterious symptoms started : That May , Vicky developed a bad cough and sharp neck pains that her doctor could n't explain . During a period of three months , she became absentminded-forgetting where she 'd hung up her coat-dizzy , and so weak that she could n't hold a teacup . Even her personality changed . Once avidly antismoking , Vicky took up cigarettes . " I thought it was just teenage rebellion , " says Beryl . " But now I think , " God , she must have been so frightened . ' " Vicky , who now lies comatose in a Deeside , Wales , hospital room strewn with stuffed animals , is no longer alone in her fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine other young Britons since 1993-a new vari ant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease , or CJD-is not only fatal ( eight of the victims have already died ) , it has also triggered the greatest public-health scare in recent British history . On March 20 , the government admitted , after many denials dating back to 1990 , that the illness may come from eating meat from diseased cowsnamely those with so-called mad cow disease , a close relative of CJD .

" // Certainly the outcry comes too late for Vicky Rimmer , who can no longer move , swallow or see . But for Beryl , who has publicly battled the slowmoving government for three years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a sense of hard-won victory . Vicky , born in North Wales 18 years ago , was raised by Beryl , a former clerical worker , and her late husband , trucking contractor Glyn Rimmer , when their only daughter , Helen , left home four months after having Vicky at age 18 . ( Helen now visits the Rimmers two or three times a year . ) Vicky , an aspiring artist and model , was " animal-mad , " her grandmother says , spending every weekend working at a kennel and lavishing attention on her springer spaniel Sophie . " She would have any animal if I would let her , " says Beryl . When the teenager first complained of neck and arm pains , her doctor in Deeside could n't find anything unusual . " There 's nothing wrong , " he told Beryl . " Send her to school . " Yet Vicky 's forgetfulness persisted , and she began to get thinner and weaker . Finally , after nearly falling off a ride during a class trip to Alton Towers theme park in England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for tests . That same week , Vicky 's grandfather Glyn died at 53 from a heart attack after showing symptoms strikingly similar to his granddaughter 's . " My husband was a big guy of 252 pounds and lost weight down to 154 , " says Beryl . " He started lighting four cigarettes at time and put on his sweater back to front . This was a guy who had his own business . " Beryl is convinced his death was caused by CJD . By late August , when Vicky was undergoing more tests at Walton Hospital in Liverpool , she too was rapidly losing weight , dipping to 84 pounds . One day , when Beryl was feeding her yogurt , she realized Vicky was no longer swallowing . Her body began jerking violently , and she went into a coma . It took a government scientist from Scotland three weeks to finally deliver a firm diagnosis : fatal spongiform encephalopathy . " I drove home that night and called my doctor , " Bery says . " There was a deadly silence when I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Of course I 've heard of it . It 's mad cow disease . ' " With no hope of recovery , Vicky was moved to Deeside Community Hospita two years ago so her grandmother can visit daily . Since medical bills forced Beryl to sell the family home last year , she has lived in nearby Heswall in a house loaned by a sympathetic friend . Unlike the other young people diagnosed with CJD , who have died quickly , Vicky has gained weight through artifi cial feeding and could live for years , doctors say . For Beryl , there is bitter satisfaction in her granddaughter 's stubborn survival . " It 's like Vicky is hanging on to say , Prove it to them , Mum , ' ' " she says . " They just thought she would go away . " <p>
