<p> This was supposed to be the season when the Astros took the next step . The script seemed to be in place to go from doormats in 1991 to break-even in 1992 to contender in 1993 . <p> It 's now mid-June . And the script is not being followed . <p> So far , all the Astros are is a shinier , more expensive version of the teams from the past two years . They still ca n't pitch on the road , still ca n't establish any kind of consistency and have yet to demonstrate what kind of mark they will leave on the 1993 pennant race . <p> " " That 's true  --  we 're not defining ourselves , " said general manager Bill Wood , who has been candid in assessing the team 's shortcomings recently . " " There 's no stamp on this ballclub . We 're not dominating the league with our pitching ; we 're not dominating the league with our hitting ; we 're not proving that we 're a comeback ballclub on a consistent basis . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our club . It 's a quote , " nice club . ' And we 're headed for a quote , " nice season . ' But we want more than that , and the players want more than that . If we continue at the pace we 're headed , we 'll probably win 90 games . <p> But we want to win the division . In order to win , the players need to take the game a notch higher . " <p> As they begin what could be the most important week of their season tonight against San Diego in the Astrodome , the Astros find themselves teetering on the brink . With first-place San Francisco following the Padres into the Dome , the Astros have the opportunity to get back into the National League West race with a good week . <p> It is obvious that this is the time for some players  - -  especially the pitchers  --  to take their game a notch higher , as their boss puts it . <p> " " The one thing this team has been able to do in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've been able to bounce back , " manager Art Howe said . " " When we 've been in the toughest spots , we 've been able to pull it together and come up with a solid performance . " <p> But even if the Astros do follow form and play well during this six-game homestand , a treacherous 10-game trip to Los Angeles , Atlanta and Cincinnati follows . Unless the Astros can find a way to improve their road play , this will go down as a season of high expectations that were not met . <p> There are rumblings , mainly from the talk shows and other traditional second-guessers , that Howe 's job might be hanging in the balance if results do n't improve in a hurry . Wood is quick to back up Howe and his strategy during games . The general manager believes the players need to take more responsibility for leadership inside the clubhouse . <p> " " I think our effort there ( managing ) , and the conduct of the ballgames , is fine , " Wood said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players to overcome our shortcomings and to try to get players to make adjustments necessary both physically and mentally . So far , the response of the guys is n't what we want it to be . <p> " " Maybe as a group , they 're at a point in time in their development where they have n't realized how important this side of the game is . It 's not just how many runs I drive in tonight that determines whether we win or lose . It 's the mental side of the game : Support each other ; push each other . To get to a higher level of accountability . " <p> The form chart says the Astros will follow the embarrassment of the weekend sweep in Colorado with a hot streak . They have been able to bounce back from every horrible stretch with a winning week that puts them right back where they started . <p> After being swept three games at home by Philadelphia to start the season , the Astros had a 5-1 road trip . They went 5-5 from April 15-26 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season . <p> Since then , they have had stretches of 5-0 , 1-4 , 6-2 , 1-7 , 8-2 and 1-5 . That kind of up-and-down tendency usually is not the calling card of a division contender . <p> " " There is a lack of continuity and a lack of focus on a regular basis , " Wood said . " " We 're hot and cold , up and down . We have these streaks . We need to gain more consistency in all phases of the game . " <p> The biggest problem , as it has been for the last three seasons , has been pitching . Wood described the situation as " " pitching lights-out at home and being stinko on the road . " Though the Astros ' staff is older and more experienced than in the recent past , the disparity between the home and road numbers has been no better than that of the younger pitchers of the last two seasons . <p> At home , with the big dimensions , the staff has a 3.02 ERA . <p> On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come up with an average of five runs per game to have a chance . Because of that , the Astros are 13-15 on the road this season . <p> Moreover , since going 8-3 on their first two trips , they are 5-12 on the road and have allowed 94 runs in those 17 games , an average of 5.53 . No Astros pitcher has a better ERA on the road than at home . Only Greg Swindell ( 4.70 home , 5.32 road ) and Mark Portugal ( 2.93 home , 3.64 road ) have road ERAs even within a run of their home figure . <p> " " If you get a well-pitched game night after night , you 've got more chance to be consistent , " Wood said . " " Hitting is going to come and go . Defense is going to come and go . We 've improved our offense from last year ; we 've improved our defense . Our pitching needs to step up . " <p> Wood also believes that the players need to look inward and come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He does not think any one player can be the potentate of the clubhouse . Rather , he would like to see several players get involved . <p> " " Look around baseball today , and name me five guys that are leaders , " Wood said . " " I mean true , upfront leaders . Maybe in today 's baseball world , maybe all of the veterans need to pitch in in that regard . How about a little togetherness and a little community effort to provide the leadership ? That would be a new and novel idea . <p> " " I 'm not asking them to do anything evident . They do n't have to do it in the dugout . They can do it in the clubhouse , behind closed doors . But they need to look at the game beyond their own individual performance . Whether or not we won or lost the game . <p> That 's the bottom line . We have to illuminate the situation for the players and try to get them to broaden their view . " From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a critical part of the show . He likes the talent on the team he has put together . He just wants to see more in the way of the consistency on the field and maturity in the clubhouse . <p> " " I feel we 've got as good a talent as any team in the league , " Wood said . " " The key is which team is most successful dealing with the things that happen to every team during the season . That 's where that leadership comes in . <p> " " The leadership factor inside the club is important . There are players right now who are disappointed . But do they let it ride ? Or do they expect more out of themselves and their teammates ? <p> " " In order to be a winner , you 've got to develop . The last few ( road ) trips have shown us we need to pay more attention to this ingredient . " The next week should provide some answers as to whether the Astros will become the contending team many expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs around the middle of the division .
