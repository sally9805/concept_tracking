Each year Saudi Arabian border guards monitor transports carrying Muslim pilgrims back from Mecca . The purpose is to discourage any of the 2 million or so visitors from staying on illegally ; a fine of 1,604 riyal ( about $430 ) is levied for each person recorded as entering the country who does not appear on a checklist of those leaving . This year companies bearing the Turkish faithful home have so far been forced to pay some 200,000 riyal ( $54,000 ) for no-shows . The trouble is , almost all of them were probably among the 1,426 killed in the July 2 tunnel disaster . The Turkish government is complaining that Saudi officials hastily interred many of the victims in mass graves without identifying them ; since no death certificates were issued , it was impossible to prove to authorities that people were not going out of the country because they had been buried in it .
