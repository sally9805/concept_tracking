<p> The giants of Japan Inc. may be full of vitality , but they increasingly resemble oases in a wasteland . <p> Take the Toshiba Corporation , which churns out some of the world 's most advanced laptop computers , compressing 2,000 tiny parts into a machine in a dozen hours , start to finish , at its sleek factory here on the far outskirts of Tokyo . <p> But once those laptops enter Japan 's labyrinthine domestic distribution network , they can still take up to three months to move onto the store shelves in a major shopping district in Tokyo , a two-hour train ride away . <p> This is the divided nature of the Japanese economy , where the strong and the weak , the export powerhouses and the domestic sluggards , the highly efficient manufacturers and the featherbedded service sector often operate side by side . That is why it is so hard to respond when asked : Is the Japanese economy staging a comeback ? Or is it withering away ? <p> The answer is yes  --  to both questions . <p> Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toshiba to Sony , from Toyota to Fuji , are muscling their way once again to the forefront of the global marketplace . Forced to battle with American and European companies in open markets with volatile exchange rates and fickle consumer tastes , these companies have been bruised and battered , but remain perhaps the toughest competitors in the world . <p> At the same time , the cosseted pillars of the domestic Japanese economy  --  retail shops , distributors , utilities , brokerage firms and banks  --  are limping along or falling through cracks in the path . <p> " The polarization of the economy is deepening , " Osamu Watanabe , the top bureaucrat in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry , declared at a news conference on Sept. 8 . " If we hear opinions from poor performers , they suggest a rather serious economic outlook . If we hear opinions from good performers , however , they provide a more positive view . " <p> The Government is trying to fix the gap with a bells-and-whistles deregulation program that it hopes will nudge competition and efficiency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , the duality is making economic recovery all that much more elusive for Japanese policy makers because the same bag of economic tricks will not work for everyone . <p> In the past , when Japan 's brand-name exporters did well , they acted as a locomotive , pulling the entire nation along behind them . Partly because exporters now make their products with parts from all over the world , that formula no longer works so well . <p> " You ca n't have a self-sustaining recovery when only leading manufacturers are experiencing a big improvement , " said Mineko Sasaki-Smith , an economist at Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo . " We can not expect the top leading elite companies to pull the rest of the economy out . " <p> Even as the exporters are getting leaner and richer , companies in more conservative , protected industries are becoming fatter and poorer , creating an increasingly stratified business system in a country that prides itself on egalitarianism . <p> And the Government often makes things worse . A nationwide increase in the sales tax in April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the economy . In part to beat the tax increase , consumers and business went on a spending spree , pushing the economy ahead at an annual growth rate of 5.7 percent in the first quarter , only to see the economy fall off sharply in the second quarter , actually shrinking at an 11.2 percent annual rate . <p> But even as the Japanese economy struggles to emerge from the long period of weakness that followed the bursting of the speculative bubble here in the early 1990 's , a hardy corps of super companies and super industries has emerged from the muck . <p> Earlier this year , the Sony Corporation , the Honda Motor Company , Canon Inc. , the Sharp Corporation and Sumitomo Electric Industries , among others , announced record profits for the year ending in March 1997 . And now , Sony , Honda and Canon are poised to post a second year of record profits . Year-over-year production of Japanese personal computers , mobile telephones and other telecommunications products has increased rapidly since the industry emerged from recession in 1994 . Electronics companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 percent this year , mainly because of strong exports . <p> While exporters hum , Japanese financial institutions , unable or unwilling to write off losses from the past , are still wading through piles of bad debt . Nippon Credit Bank , one of the nation 's largest banks , was essentially rescued by a Government-orchestrated bailout . For the first time since World War II , a Japanese life insurance company , Nissan Mutual , went bankrupt . Many brokerage firms expect losses in the first half of this year , and oil companies , electric companies , airlines and paper companies are barely keeping afloat . <p> " This is not a good phenomenon , " said Masaru Takagi , chief economist at Fuji Research Institute . " We need homogeneous economic expansion . " <p> The expanding cleavage in the Japanese economy means that employees at Toshiba 's computer factory can use microscopes to manipulate the steel heads one-tenth of the size of a piece of hair on a hard drive , but its sales people can not manipulate the wholesalers and retailers to conduct transactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middlemen . <p> This is especially painful for Toshiba because the life cycle of a given model of , say , a laptop may be only six months , half of which may be lost to transportation . Still , Toshiba 's computer division has fared rather well , though the company 's profits , hurt by a weak market for semiconductors , fell by 26 percent , to 67 billion yen ( or $553.5 million ) , last year . It expects profits to rise modestly next year . <p> The dual nature of the economy also creates a split personality within international companies like Toshiba . Managers who have sparred with foreign competitors overseas return home to find themselves infuriated by less open-minded , more relationship-bound Japanese managers who are used to relaxing under protection or adhering to regulation in the domestic market . <p> " It 's like some kind of fight , " said Fumio Yamashita , a senior manager of Toshiba 's domestic computer business . " There are the domestic people , then there 's the efficiency-wise international business side . They 're totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the have-nots may grow in the coming years . Deregulation will begin to kick in in a number of industries , including the financial sector , and create huge new opportunities for the best companies or bankruptcy for the worst . <p> Oil , one of Japan 's most heavily regulated sectors , is a prime example . The industry is undergoing a shakeout as the Government allows more companies to import oil , causing domestic prices to fall even as crude oil , priced in dollars , becomes more expensive . <p> Similarly , the Government proposed this spring to cut power costs to bring them in line with overseas standards and help make the industry more competitive . Although the proposal would cut profitability in the power industry , even the utilities are acknowledging  --  a bit grumpily  --  the need to lower their prices . <p> " There 's a movement among some industries that are behind to reform themselves and catch up with the tide of the times , " said Tatsuo Matsuoka , a senior equity analyst at Daiwa Research Institute . " Their primary domain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been exposed to keen international competition . And now , they 're beginning to realize they ca n't ignore international competition . " <p> These industries are in the sinking half of the economy , and as they face new market pressures , they are hemorrhaging red ink . The hope here in Japan is that market discipline , while trimming salaries and jobs , will eventually impel some companies into the booming part of the economy . Change , though , has been excruciatingly slow . The retail industry , for example , has watched large stores encroach on mom-and-pop shops , but the small shops still made up 91 percent of all retail establishments in 1994 , compared with 96 percent in 1979 . <p> Another monument to inefficiency is the airline industry , which has fallen behind international competitors like United Airlines because flights and air fares into or out of Japan have been so heavily regulated , elevating ticket prices to among the highest in the world . The loosening of regulation and prices , coupled with growing foreign competition , has pushed Japan Airlines into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $74.3 million ) this last year . At All Nippon Airways , the major domestic carrier , profits tumbled 34 percent from the previous year . <p> " The business is good and the numbers of passengers are growing steadily , but prices have fallen , " said Tadatoshi Utaka , an airline analyst at Nikko Research Center in Tokyo . " Japanese airlines suffer from high costs , but they must lower their prices to compete with foreign airlines . " <p> Even when the airlines recognize the problem , though , it is hard to cut fares when wages and other costs are so much higher than elsewhere . After regulations were relaxed more than a year ago so that airlines could adjust prices without Government permission , average ticket prices at All Nippon Airways fell but only by tiny amounts  --  2 percent on international flights and 3 percent on domestic prices  --  said Masato Matsuyama , a spokesman for the airline . <p> " When foreign airlines lower prices , you have to keep up with them in order to compete , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may find that nobody is on your plane when it 's ready to take off . " <p> Graphs : " JAPAN 'S ECONOMY IS HALF FULL . . . AND HALF EMPTY " Japan 's economy is dividing into the haves and the have-nots . While exports are rebounding , helping companies that make high-tech products , weak growth in the domestic economy is hurting companies in other sectors .
