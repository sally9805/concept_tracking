The Neptunus 54 hardtop express cruiser will seduce you with her sensuous styling , inviting interior and lusty performance . Photograph Photograph // eptunus Yachts is named after the Roman god who was king of the sea-but for the just-launched 54 Express , with its sensuous curves and elegant interior , sea goddess would be the more apt epithet . As I approached the 54 at Surfside 3 Marina in New York City 's Chelsea Piers sports complex , it definitely stood out , both for its sleek Eurostyle looks and for its innovative lowprofile hardtop configuration . The appeal of the hardtop is the streamlined weather shelter it provides , allowing the yacht to offer three distinct social areas in its unique layout , including two near-equal salons : an upper salon in the enclosed helm area , a lower salon with galley , and an open cockpit . For diehard sun worshipers , on the other hand , the 54 also comes in an open Express Sport version . Semicustom builder Neptunus Yachts , based in St. Catherines , Ontario , is the Canadian arm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Canadian division , according to its head , corporate V ? . Jan Willem de Jong , focuses on larger-end luxury yachts from 50 to 70 feet designed expressly for the North American market . A delivery trip de Jong was making on the 54 from the factory to Neptunus ' Suburban Boatworks dealership in Brick , NJ. , gave us a chance to ride along for the 40-mile southward leg from Manhattan to New Jersey 's Manasquan Inlet . With de Jong at the helm , the 54 , powered by a pair of optional 660-hp Caterpillar diesels , eased onto plane quickly with minimal bow rise as we headed down the Hudson River . We were soon plying our way through New York Harbor at about 28 knots , dodging commercial traffic as we watched the rising sun set the World Trade Center and Statue of Liberty aglow . The engines were impressively quiet , allowing easy conversation . Shortly after heading out through the Narrows and past Sandy Hook , N.J. , into the Atlantic , I took the wheel for a spell . We began cruising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled back to a still-swift 25knot/1700-rpm cruise as the seas built to lumpy two- to four-footers . The 54 felt surefooted , giving us a smooth , stable ride in the predominantly quartering seas . When we changed course briefly , its landings in head seas were respectably soft . The yacht was responsive and graceful in turns , and tracked well . ( We only used the autopilot for a short stretch . ) In calmer waters , the 54 has posted a top speed of 34 knots/2300 rpm with these engines , according to de Jong , and with larger options is expected to hit 38 .

( opening spread and above ) . // Barely over an hour and a half after setting out , we entered Manasquan Inlet , separating the popular ports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its beautiful beach and boardwalk . This area was once the scene of the real-life incident that inspired " Jaws , " but today 's excitement seemed to be the Neptunus ' grand entrance , which turned more than a few admiring heads . On taking a look around the 54 , I was struck by its first-rate workmanship and elegant , luxurious appointments . One notable attribute is the near absence of square corners both inside and out . U.K.-based Tony Castro was the yacht designer , while de Jong and his Neptunus team , including Marco Vandermaas as interior designer , were responsible for everything else . The builder employs advanced CAD/CAM techniques , including a 3-D program . The hull is a deep-V with 19-degree transom deadrise and prop tunnels , and construction is high-quality , utilizing handlaid fiberglass and end-grain balsacore . At the transom is a large nonskid swim platform with hidden ladder . Aft side steps lead forward to nonskid walkarounds to the foredeck , with a high , continuous bowrail for safety . All fittings , including the jumbo cleats , are of stainless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an anchor roller and standard electric windlass , while the foredeck sports a large sunpad . Starboard transom steps and a gate lead to the boat 's nonskid cockpit , which holds a large vinyl aft L-lounge with fiberglass table , and , under the hardtop overhang , port and starboard consoles hiding a standard Kitchen Aid grill , wet bar , and icemaker or fridge . Electric sunroof An artistically sculpted **25;142;TOOLONG sliding door with pullacross drapes leads into the 54 's lightand-airy upper salon and helm station . A unique feature is a big glass sunroof which is fitted with a shade and , along with the side windows , opens electrically . The feeling of spaciousness here is further enhanced by the yacht 's generous 15 ' 6 " beam and 6 ' 8 " headroom . Visibility is almost 360 degrees , and is exceptional over the bow through the large wraparound windshield . At the helm station , to starboard , is an adjustable UltraLeather Recaro helm seat with a backrest that inflates to give the driver lumbar support , and there 's an adjacent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , linked to hydraulic steering , and standard single-lever Microcommander electronic engine controls ( which I found a tad hard to reach from the helm seat , but this is being remedied ) . A Carpathian-elm-veneer dash holds the neatly laid-out instrument and electronics panel , below which are the systems switches and controls for a standard Vetus bowthruster and trim tabs . In addition to a standard compass , this 54 was equipped with a full complement of optional Raytheon electronics-from radar to autopilot and chart plotter . Immediately abaft the helm station is a six-person UltraLeather L-lounge/ sofabed with fold-out cherry dining table facing a standard entertainment center with a 20-inch Sony TV/VCR and a 10-speaker stereo system with CD changer . Lending richness and warmth , the cabinetry here and throughout the yacht is of exquisitely crafted and finished lacquered cherry , complemented by leatherette-covered walls and overheads and thick wall-towall carpeting . A range of color and fabric choices is available . Several port-side steps lead down to the roomy lower salon , which has a curved six-person UltraLeather lounge with cherry coffee table to starboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are provided by two screened overhead hatches and four portlights . On the port side is an open L-shaped galley with a tile floor and a long Corian countertop . All standard are a concealed Sub-Zero fridge/freezer , Panasonic convection/microwave oven , ceramic stovetop , B &D; coffeemaker , and double sink with pull-out Moen faucet . Adjacent are the a.c. and d.c. electrical panels . Storage is plentiful here and throughout the yacht . The spacious master stateroom , aft behind a privacy door , has an island queen berth with box-spring mattress and mirrored headboard , as well as twin nightstands , two cedar hanging lockers , two portlights , a vanity and TV . In the ensuite head are a Corian countertop , tile floor , round shower , portlight , fan , Raritan electric MSD , and a locker housing a standard washer/dryer . The forward VIP stateroom , with privacy door and another queensize berth , is similarly appointed , and has access to a dual-entry head . Optional crew cabin Beneath the 54 's cockpit lounge is an electrically controlled hatch that opens to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew cabin or laundry facility . A door here leads forward into a roomy engine compartment with good walkaround space . Helping to minimize vibration and noise , there 's three-inch-thick sound insulation and the engines are mounted on steel plates and vibration-damping pads . Neptunus offers eight power choices , with twin 550-hp Detroit Diesels standard . Other major standard features include an 11-kW Westerbeke generator , Cruisair air-conditioning , central vacuum system and Halon fireextinguishing system . The Neptunus 54 's beauty , in short , is far more than skin-deep , and she comes loaded with big-boat features and extra touches-all at a surprisingly reasonable price . s // Neptunus 54 Express // <p>
