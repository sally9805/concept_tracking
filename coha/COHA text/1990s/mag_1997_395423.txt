Packed with late-season bloomers , recycled pots make a vivid statement . // Looking for something in which to display cut flowers or potted plants ? You might consider going to a store and buying a vessel made specifically for the purpose ; vases and cachepots of cut crystal , sterling silver , and porcelain have been around for centuries . Or you could put aside your wallet and forage through your basement , attic , or garage and uncover a wealth of possibilities : Tin cans , chipped teapots , and galvanized buckets all provide spirited support for flowers and plants . It appears , in fact , that some floral designers and savvy home gardeners have shied away from formal vases altogether ; instead , they reach for quirky castoffs . These promoters of " attic art " seem to be saying , " Sure , you can buy a vase or a terra-cotta pot , but can you see the possibilities in an old graniteware bread box ? " In Potted Gardens ( Crown ; $27.50 ) , garden designer Rebecca Cole extols the virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even a retired baby 's bathtub hold miniature gardens well suited to small spaces , including city balconies and rooftops . Along a deck railing or windowsill , a half dozen abandoned toy trucks form a posie-packed convoy . An old colander holds a happy spring display of tulips , primroses , and hyacinths , while rusted rejects such as cable spools find new life when laid on their sides and planted with sunny coreopsis and other bright bloomers . Photograph Cut flowers lend their exuberant colors to a variety of containers , including ( clockwise , from top ) an earthenware milk jug , spongeware crock , red ceramic pitcher , graniteware coffeepot , and glazed ceramic teapot . Among the many sources for similar finds are flea markets and yard sales , attics and garages . Casual arrangements such as these look wonderful when displayed outdoors on top of picnic and patio tables-even on a rickety chair In the middle of a grassy field . // Where do gardeners find such trashy treasures ? Popular haunts include weekly flea markets held in most major cities , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors are loath to reveal their favorite sources , others are more than forthcoming . Veteran collector Mary Randolph Carter names namesand provides addresses , too-in Garden Junk ( Penguin ; $29.95 , paperback ) . Her pleasantly surrealistic approach to design incorporates the study of fine art : Paintings by Matisse and others have inspired the author 's acquisitions of bowls , pots , and kindred containers in a courageous attempt to reproduce favorite images . Ms. Carter reveals that many of her purchases cost less than $5 . Of course , some gardeners have all the luck : They or their relatives live in big houses or on farms where it is easier ( and sometimes less painful ) to squirrel away no-longer-loved coffeepots and canisters than it is to throw out the relics . These fortunate few need only rummage through closets , sheds , and storerooms to gather material . The key lies in learning to view objects in fresh ways : Just because a discarded firebucket once had a serious purpose does not mean it can not now be a home for cyclamen . Getting Ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displaying cut flowers . And even those that have cracks , holes , and crevices through which water may seep hold possibility . Simply fit the container with a second , smaller pot , jar , or bottle . For instance , a splint basket will make a handsome nest for just-picked daisies , lady 's mantel , and foxgloves if the flowers are first arranged in a recycled mayonnaise jar . Or consider placing a glass milk bottle inside a defective watering can and filling the bottle with long-stemmed cut flowers such as black-eyed Susans or the smaller sunflowers ( see " Late Bloomers for Cutting " for specific varieties ) . On the other hand , containers meant for pot culture must have holes . And this is where " junk " becomes therapeutic : Without guilt , gardeners may puncture the bottoms of cast-off cans , tubs , and boxes ( even boats ) knowing that far from mauling these castoffs they have saved them from oblivion . The fact is , without adequate drainage plants can not live . Correct watering of a pot-bound plant is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the water gardeners must give them to be sure roots are nourished deep down . And roots that sit in excess water will rot . A thick layer of potsherds , gravel , or recycled Styrofoam " peanuts " will delay death but wo n't prevent it . Buckets and tubs constructed of heavy metal need not be shunned in favor of materials more easily punctured . By using an awl and hammer or the pointed end of a pickax , gardeners can poke one hole every three or four inches in the container 's underside , the approximate number needed for adequate drainage . Remember that rust can alter a soil 's pH level , so most metal planters should be lined with black plastic garbage bags cut to fit ( poke drainage holes in the plastic to correspond with holes in the container ) . Wine and milk crates , toolboxes , and other wooden containers are even easier to prepare for planting , thanks to batterypowered drills . Rebecca Cole uses a threequarter-inch standard bit to create one large hole every six inches or so . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each corner . Creative Planters The simplest materials can transform flea-market finds . Inexpensive wooden finials applied to each corner of a wooden crate turn it into a spiffy Versailles-style planter ( to add height and improve drainage , consider placing the box on wooden feet ) . Or use weathered bricks to build a chimney-shaped home for a small tree or rose topiary . Easy-to-use latex paints can spruce up galvanized tubs and terra-cotta pots . One method : Paint the entire container ( exterior only ) a single color . Then create geometric surface designs such as checks , diamonds , and triangles with one-inchwide masking tape . Repaint the container a second , contrasting , hue and allow it to dry thoroughly . Remove the masking tape to reveal a distinctive , two-toned design .
