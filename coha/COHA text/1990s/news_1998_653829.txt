<p> TO hear lobbyists and lawmakers in Washington tell it , giving patients the right to sue insurers that refuse to approve medical treatment would be either the death of managed care or the salvation of patients . <p> If Federal protection against such suits is eliminated , " you 'd have businesses dropping health care coverage right and left , " warned Mark Merritt , a vice president of the American Association of Health Plans . <p> Supporters of such a change argue that it is the fair thing to do . " If you make a medical decision affecting patient care , you 've got to be responsible for it , " said John Stone , a spokesman for Representative Charlie Norwood , the Georgia Republican who sponsored an early liability bill , which has been stuck in a House committee . <p> Under the banner of patients ' rights , a new set of bills is under consideration in Congress ; some of which would allow a broader range of legal actions against health maintenance organizations and other employer health plans . And as Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the ability to file such suits , as well as a separate process to appeal insurance decisions , has been available for more than a year . <p> What lessons does Texas offer ? The short answer is that the spotty early evidence does not support a lot of the dire warnings on Capitol Hill about a landslide of litigation . In fact , lawyers in Texas say that not one suit has been filed so far , and there have been fewer appeals of insurance rulings than expected . Still , decisions in fully half of those appeals have gone against the insurers . <p> Doctors here in Texas , meanwhile , report that H.M.O. 's  --  which have been the focus of the most criticism  --  are showing more willingness to go along with their treatment plans . Yet figures reported to the state by health plans indicate that medical costs have not begun to spiral . <p> It was stories like that of Leon Hand that persuaded a Texas lawmaker , State Senator David Sibley of Waco , to push through the nation 's first legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Hand , a 49-year-old auto mechanic in San Antonio , left a Humana hospital before dawn in the fall of 1990 after a managed-care doctor decided by phone that he did not need to be admitted for a severe headache and high blood pressure , even though an emergency room physician said he should stay . As he was getting into his pickup truck , Mr. Hand said he suffered the first symptoms of a stroke . His left side has been partly paralyzed ever since , and Mr. Hand says he is disabled for life . <p> Mr. Hand sued the Humana Health Plan of Texas but soon learned that such a case would be pushed from state to Federal court , where a Federal law would shield his employer-sponsored health plan from virtually all liability . <p> MR . HAND settled with Humana for $100,000 . He also collected $275,000 from the managed-care doctor and a token $150 from the emergency physician who had tried to get him admitted . <p> In answering Mr. Hand 's suit , the health plan denied his allegations and added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Income Security Act of 1974 , or Erisa . Bruce Anderson , a lawyer for the managed-care doctor , said there was no way to have predicted Mr. Hand 's stroke . He added that the emergency room physician could have called another doctor to try to have Mr. Hand admitted , since he was covered by a less-restrictive preferred provider organization rather than by an H.M.O. <p> In any case , under the malpractice shield of Erisa , Mr. Hand probably would have been able to collect only the cost of the denied treatment plus court costs and legal fees  --  if anything . It is that shield that Texas has tried to pierce . <p> Now , under a bill sponsored by Senate Democrats in Washington , all states would be given the freedom to adopt similar laws . That measure , as well as competing Republican " patient rights " bills without such liability provisions , are pending before Congress . The Norwood bill is not under active consideration . <p> Proponents of exposing H.M.O. 's to such lawsuits say a health plan should not be exempt from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is practicing medicine when , in a quest to contain costs , it decides not only whether a plan covers a type of treatment but also whether the treatment is necessary for a particular patient . <p> Now , " if the lack of care kills you , " Mr. Stone said , " you can only recover the cost of the care . " <p> The goal of the Erisa protection , which applies only to employer-sponsored health plans , was to keep multistate corporations from having to tangle with a mass of state regulations . Opponents of easing that protection say it would lead to more litigation and higher premiums and leave fewer Americans with health insurance . Changing Erisa , they argue , would mean suits not only against H.M.O. 's but also against employers who provide the insurance . <p> The bills before Congress also propose independent reviews that would let patients appeal insurance rejections without suing . Here , too , Texas is among at least 14 states that have led the way . The 1997 Texas law allowing lawsuits also established an independent review process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator Sibley  --  who is a a former oral surgeon and a practicing lawyer  --  have testified before Congressional committees on the state 's law and have traveled nationwide to speak to others considering such measures . <p> " We have circumnavigated the United States about 10 times , " said Kim Ross , a spokeswoman for the Texas Medical Association , which represents the state 's doctors and lobbied for the legislation . <p> Ron Pollack , executive director of Families USA , a national organization for health care consumers , said , " The Texas example is cited frequently because Texas has the most far-reaching legislation as far as this litigation question . " <p> True , some Texas H.M.O. 's say they are losing money and will have to raise premiums , but they are suffering mainly from their battle to underbid competitors and gain market share , said George Parker Young , a lawyer in Fort Worth who handles suits against H.M.O. 's . The bill " has not added one dime to the litigation budget of the H.M.O. 's , because not one lawsuit has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anyway . Mr. Young concedes that he is planning to file two lawsuits soon . And Jeff Kloster , general counsel for the Texas Association of Health Plans , a trade association for insurers , points to newspaper ads run by Texas lawyers seeking patients as clients and to conferences held around the state to educate trial lawyers about the new law . " There will be lawsuits , " he said . <p> Even the law 's proponents  --  who , for the most part , say they do not expect an onslaught  --  acknowledge that it is probably a matter of time before some suits arise . The bill took effect on Sept. 1 , 1997 , leaving little more than a year for patients to suffer injuries , contact lawyers and prepare suits . Texas law generally gives victims two years to sue . <p> Mr. Young said one of the suits he was preparing involved the family of a 68-year-old man whose H.M.O. decided he was ready to be released from a psychiatric ward despite his history of suicide attempts . The night he was released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young said . <p> One reason for the slow start on litigation is uncertainty over how open the field is for litigation . Questions remain about whether the state law can erase the presumed Federal protections without Congressional action . Before the Texas law went into effect , the Aetna Life Insurance Company and its Texas subsidiaries challenged the measure in Federal District Court in Houston . That suit is pending . <p> Even the bill 's sponsor , Dr. Sibley , is unsure of the extent to which it applies to Erisa-protected plans , which may cover as many as 80 percent of Texans with private , employer-provided insurance . Not subject to Erisa are those covered by government employee plans , government programs like Medicare , policies bought by individuals and some small-employer plans . <p> To complicate matters , some Erisa employer plans are more protected than others . States have less power to regulate self-insured employer plans  --  which are widespread among the largest employers  --  than ones bought from insurance companies . <p> Without Congressional action , the question of whether Texas 's law skirts Erisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In responding to the Aetna suit , Texas argued that its law made H.M.O. 's liable only for " medical treatment decisions " that affect the quality of patient care and therefore was not pre-empted by Federal law . " Congress never intended to pre-empt states from regulating people that make medical decisions , " said David C. Mattax , an assistant attorney general in Texas . <p> In fact , some Federal circuit courts have ruled that Erisa protections should not apply in cases where the health plan made a decision involving quality of care issues . So even without new laws , Erisa 's protection may narrow . <p> And the Texas law is also intended to demolish one argument that H.M.O. 's have used to avoid liability . Like some other states , Texas bars the practice of medicine by corporations ; insurers have used that provision to argue against malpractice suits , saying that because they are forbidden to practice medicine , they can not be sued for malpractice . <p> But critics question that logic . " It 's like being stopped by a cop for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't possibly have been speeding because it 's against the law in Texas to speed , ' " said Elizabeth Kilbride , a Houston lawyer who handles medical malpractice cases . <p> The new law removes that argument , Dr. Sibley said ; Missouri made a similar change . <p> The Texas law has also not resulted in the expected number of appeals from patients who are denied treatment by insurers . <p> The Texas Insurance Department forecast as many as 4,400 appeals the first year . But by Sept. 4 , just more than a year after the law took effect , there had been only 218 . <p> Is this because H.M.O. 's were already doing a good job ? Or because the new law has made them more responsive ? Or because patients just have n't heard about their right to appeal ? The answers depend on whom you ask . <p> Mr. Kloster , of the Texas Association of Health Plans , points to the myriad internal appeals that were already available . The low number of appeals to the state , he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process has always and continues to work effectively . " <p> But proponents of the appeals emphasize that about half the independent review organization 's decisions have gone against insurers . " We 're finding out the H.M.O. is wrong half the time , " Mr. Young said . " That 's pretty scary . " <p> And Phil Dunne , chief executive of the Texas Medical Foundation , the only outside organization certified by the state Insurance Department to perform reviews , said in an interview in August : " Would you be confident if 50 percent of the time you went to a hospital or a physician or health care provider you did n't get what you needed ? " <p> While there have been relatively few independent appeals , the number of complaints to the Insurance Department is up sharply . <p> The independent review organization has overruled insurers and granted surgery to repair a chest-wall deformity for a 4-year-old ; a kidney transplant for a 51-year-old woman , and a second circumcision for a 9-month-old to correct a botched first one . <p> It sided with insurers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulin injection unit because he feared needles ; a 21-year-old with a deformed head who requested surgery , and a 48-year-old with ovarian cancer who asked for high-dose chemotherapy . <p> ONE patient who won her appeal was Dora Cisneros , 34 , of Tomball , just north of Houston , who said she suffered from chronic pain since being treated for a hyperactive thyroid two years ago . She appealed her health plan 's denial of training in " chronic pain management " so she could cope without resorting to strong drugs . <p> Fifteen days after the case went into independent review , Ms. Cisneros prevailed . " I felt like I had won the lottery , " she said . " I was just so thankful that somebody that reviewed this could see that this was beneficial . Thank God that we live in Texas . " <p> Ms. Cisneros said she went for her first pain-management training session on Aug. 5 . By Aug. 25 , " I was able to open up my apple juice . " <p> " I was so excited , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A spokesman for her managed-care plan , Jefferson Pilot Financial , said it had no comment . <p> At the organization that conducts reviews , the Texas Medical Foundation , a doctor in the appropriate medical specialty goes over the record and then makes a decision , Mr. Dunne said . The specialist might consult with other experts but does not talk to the patient or doctor involved , he said . Under Texas law , the insurer pays the cost of the review , which is $460 or $650 , depending on the specialty . <p> While Ms. Cisneros was pleased with the way her appeal was handled , some others are skeptical of the process . <p> " How can anyone evaluate anyone properly without seeing them one on one ? " asked James C. Benson , a Houston lawyer who represents another patient who went through the process . " If it 's just a records review , how is that any different than an insurance review ? " <p> The Texas Medical Foundation has a response . " You 're getting an outside entity to evaluate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interest in the outcome , " said Rhonda Eidom , a spokeswoman . <p> Despite the lack of suits , some Texans say insurers have already changed the way they do business to avoid lawsuits and reviews . <p> Dr. Phil Berry , an orthopedic surgeon in Dallas , said insurers were less likely to drag their feet in approving a procedure or to give his staff members the runaround . " We have seen a much better attitude on the part of H.M.O. 's now as to recommendations we make for patients , " he said . " They seem to be more willing to pay for what we ask for . " <p> Keith Kouba , a lobbyist for the Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce , also suspects that Texas insurers have become more liberal in approving treatment . But that does not make him happy . " We 're looking at basically going back to indemnity insurance days where insurers paid for whatever the physician asked for , " he said . " We 're going to be back to the era of defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sustain that . " <p> While there are anecdotal reports that insurers are paying for more procedures , even some unnecessary ones , insurance department statistics through the end of March suggest otherwise . The state 's full-service H.M.O. 's reported an increase of only seven-tenths of 1 percent in the amount spent on medical expenses for each member per month from the end of September 1997 , compared with a 4.5 percent increase the previous six months . <p> A national survey this year by the Kaiser Family Foundation , a health care philanthropy , and Harvard University found that 55 percent of respondents said they were at least " somewhat worried " that if they were sick their health plan would be more concerned about saving money than about the best treatment . Sixty-four percent said they favored a law allowing patients to sue health plans for malpractice , and 88 percent wanted a law requiring independent reviews . Support dropped when those polled were faced with the prospect of employers ' stopping coverage or insurers ' raising premiums . <p> In Washington , there is a wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Congressional Budget Office reported that the Democratic bill 's liability provision would add 1.2 percent to insurance premiums . Its independent review process would add three-tenths of a percent , the agency said . <p> A study conducted by the Barents Group of KPMG Peat Marwick for the American Association of Health Plans predicted that the liability provision in Representative Norwood 's bill could push up premiums as much as 8.6 percent and result in a loss of health insurance for 1.8 million Americans . The insurance trade group says the same analysis would apply to the Senate Democrats ' legislation , which has a similar provision . Sixty-seven percent of employers responding to a Chamber survey in July said they would drop employee health coverage if Congress approved legislation that could make them liable in malpractice suits . <p> IN Texas , Dr. Sibley , who won a Friend of Business award in 1995 from the Texas Association of Business and Chambers of Commerce for his role in passing tort reform , said he hoped Congress would reject all the bills . Dr. Sibley said he feared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas had done . The Democratic bill would open businesses as well as insurers to liability , he said . <p> Mr. Stone and others suspect that nothing will happen during this session , which is scheduled to end on Oct. 9 . The Republican leadership does not want added patient protections , he said , and the Democrats would be just as happy to keep the issue alive to use in coming elections . <p> Support is growing to simply watch Texas for the next two years to see what happens there , he said . <p> So far , the Lone Star State yields little that is definitive for either side . <p> " I do n't think we 'll see the true impact until the Erisa pre-emption goes away  --  if it goes away  --  and we see lawsuits filed , " said Mr. Kloster of the state health plan association . <p> Chart : " Comparing ' Patient Bill of Rights ' Proposals " Three bills pending in Congress would , among other provisions , give patients new rights to sue health plans or to seek independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill 1890 Senate Democrats LIABILITY Lets states pass laws giving patients the right to sue health plans governed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act , or Erisa , for personal injury and wrongful death .
