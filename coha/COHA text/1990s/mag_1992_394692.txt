Imagine what it would feel like to be catapulted hundreds , even thousands of years into the future , or to travel into the misty past to visit your ancestors . Ever since H. G. Wells penned his classic The Time Machine nearly one hundred years ago , humans have dreamed of breaking the bonds of time . But will these dreams ever become reality ? In just the last few years , scientists looking into this question have reached a startling conclusion  --  time travel may indeed be possible . The time " machine " needed to pull off this fantastic voyage is called a wormhole , a tunnel of warped space-time predicted by Einstein 's general theory of relativity . Before we can travel through time , however , astronomers and physicists have to learn much more about both space and time . Fortunately , we have some control over space : we can move to any point in our immediate neighborhood with little difficulty . Time , on the other hand , appears to be uncontrollable . As much as we might like to slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we speed it up . It ticks away relentlessly and at the same monotonous rate no matter what we do . Isaac Newton was convinced that time was absolute , that it ran the same for everyone throughout the universe . But in 1905 , Albert Einstein proved Newton wrong . His special theory of relativity showed that time passes at different rates for different observers . If you travel at a speed close to that of light relative to some friends of yours , your friends would perceive your time as running slower than their own . This was a significant breakthrough . Suddenly , traveling through time and voyaging to the stars seemed possible . Astronauts who leave Earth and travel close to the speed of light could , by their reckoning , cover light-years in mere days . Upon returning to Earth , however , the astronauts would find that thousands of years had elapsed . In effect , they would have traveled both to the stars and thousands of years into the future . Einstein 's special theory of relativity opened our eyes to some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory , applying only to straight-line motion at a constant speed . Einstein was n't satisfied with this . He wanted a theory that applied to all types of motion and in particular to accelerated motion . For ten years he struggled to extend the theory and , finally , in 1915 he succeeded . But his new theory did more than just generalize special relativity to accelerated motion ; it also was a theory of gravity . Acceleration and gravity , it turns out , are intricately linked . WARPED SPACE AND WORMHOLES Einstein 's general theory of relativity , as it is called , provides an important insight into the nature of space and time : gravity profoundly affects them . But because matter creates gravity , matter controls space and time . Matter curves space ; in other words , it warps and distorts it . As the density of matter in a region of space increases , the curvature of the space increases and this , in turn , slows the rate at which clocks run . If the space is curved severely enough , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physicists called the region where clocks stop the " forbidden sphere . " As scientists mathematically explored this forbidden sphere , they were dismayed to learn that its interior was cut off from the rest of the universe . General relativity could say nothing about the conditions inside it . Furthermore , the space leading down to the sphere was twisted into a bizarre funnel . No matter what direction you approached the sphere from , you would appear to be in a tunnel made of curved space . While analyzing the space-time geometry of the forbidden sphere , Einstein and a colleague , Nathan Rosen , showed that the tunnel had a mirror-image tunnel attached to its other end . It was like a " wormhole " in space with two entrances . What would happen if you tried to pass through a wormhole ? Einstein concluded that you would have to end up in another universe . After all , if a distant observer sees your clock stop as you reach the forbidden sphere , then you would see the time in the rest of the universe move infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of the universe would pass before your eyes as you descended into the wormhole . Einstein found the idea of passing into another universe repugnant . Fortunately , the details of the calculations gave him a way out  --  it would take a speed greater than that of light to pass through the wormhole , making it impassable . Whether or not you could pass through these wormholes and forbidden spheres begged the question of whether they existed and , if so , how they arose . Because matter curves space , the places to look would be regions of high densities , densities far beyond those found on Earth . One possibility stems from the fact that stars evolve  --  they are born , live for millions or billions of years , then die . And when they die , many collapse in on themselves . If a star has enough mass , it can collapse so far that it becomes cut off from our universe . Robert Oppenheimer of the California Institute of Technology was the first to use Einstein 's theory to study a star 's collapse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as it passed a particular radius ( called the gravitational radius ) , it would leave a black sphere  --  a black hole in space . The collapse would not stop there , however , but would continue until all the star 's matter occupied a point , or " singularity , " at the center of the black hole . The surface of a black hole is known as the event horizon . It is a one-way surface  --  once inside it , you can not escape . To get out you would have to travel faster than the speed of light , which relativity tells us is impossible . The simplest type of black hole is named after the German astronomer Karl Schwarzschild , who first described it in 1916 using Einstein 's theory . A Schwarzschild black hole warps the space surrounding it into a wormhole , which theoretically could act as a " subway " to distant points in the universe or to different times . These wormholes did not bring the dream of space or time travel any closer to reality , however , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a wormhole at a speed greater than that of light . BLACK HOLES GALORE The same is not true for the wormholes associated with more complex black holes . A Schwarzschild black hole is simple because it possesses neither spin nor charge . When a spinning star collapses ( and most stars do spin ) , the black hole created also spins . In 1963 New Zealand mathematician Roy Kerr solved the equations for spinning black holes , which are now called Kerr black holes . Besides mass and spin , electric charge is the only other property not crushed out of existence when a black hole forms . In the late 1910s , H. Reissner from Germany and G. Nordstrom from Denmark solved the equations for a charged black hole , which is now called a Reissner-Nordstrom black hole . The only other type of black hole possible is one with both charge and spin . The type was solved by Roy Kerr and E. Newman and is known as a Kerr-Newman black hole . The collapse of a massive star is just one way to form a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme conditions in the big bang explosion that gave birth to the universe might also have created black holes . If the big bang was inhomogeneous , black holes could have formed when pockets of matter were crushed under the tremendous pressures present . These primordial black holes would be far different from stellar-collapse black holes because of their incredibly small size  --  a typical one might have a mass of a few billion tons packed into a sphere no larger an atom . At the other end of the size spectrum , astronomers suspect that the cores of some galaxies harbor gigantic black holes with masses millions or billions of times that of the Sun and diameters the size of our solar system . All stellar-collapse black holes , on the other hand , contain a few solar masses in a sphere a few miles across . Scientists studying the physics of the four types of black holes made an unexpected discovery  --  it 's possible to pass through the wormhole of any non-Schwarzschild black hole at a speed less than that of light . Perhaps wormholes can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passageways to the stars . Scientists have encountered and overcome a host of theoretical objections to time travel since they learned wormholes could be traversed . But before the first adventurous time travelers journey through a wormhole , scientists will have to overcome many more obstacles . One of the biggest conundrums facing physicists exploring the possibility of time travel is whether time travelers could change history . Consider the grandfather paradox . Assume for a moment that wormholes will one day allow humans to travel through time . In theory , we could have a wormhole that begins near Earth and twists through space-time so that it also exits near Earth . If you passed through this wormhole , you would return to Earth either many years in the future or many years in the past . A DEATH IN THE FAMILY Now imagine finding out that your grandfather was a cruel person who destroyed many people 's lives . To protect your family name , you decide to travel back in time through one of these wormholes to do away with the nasty gent . If time travel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mother or father was born , then presumably you were never born either . But if you were never born , you could n't have traveled back to rid the world of this person in the first place . Let 's look at the problem from a different point of view . Assume you went into a time tunnel at 11:00 a.m. , passed through it , and returned to roughly the same point on Earth at 10:55 a.m. the same day . If so , you would see yourself getting into your spaceship to leave . You could then run over to yourself and say " Hello . " Indeed , you could even stop yourself from going into the tunnel . In fact , if you actually went back in time and saw yourself leave , then you should have seen yourself watching you leave in the first place . After all , it was just a replay of what happened earlier . You can imagine dozens of similar paradoxes along the same lines . They all violate what is called the causality principle , which says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a pitcher throws a baseball across home plate and a batter hits it , common sense says that the ball was not hit before the pitcher delivered . The idea that effect can come before cause is irrational to the human mind and goes against common experience . As strange as it may seem , scientists are seriously asking whether it is possible , in principle , to violate causality . If time travel is somehow possible , it seems likely that causality could be violated . If , in fact , causality can not be violated , ten time travel into the past may be prohibited . Even if causality ca n't be violated , we might be able to travel back in time as long as we do n't interfere with the past in any way . Though not as glamorous as tinkering with history , such time travel still would be exhilarating beyond imagination . Beyond the paradoxes time travel presents , strong physical constraints could keep humans from using the wormholes belonging to black holes as time machines . Shortly after wormholes were envisioned , theorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to voyage through one , the wormhole would pinch off , crushing the ship crew . And even if the ship could somehow pass through to reach a distant point in the universe , it would not be able to make the return trip . Because of a black hole 's event horizon , wormholes offer only one way passage . To get back to Earth , time travelers would have to find another wormhole nearby  --  a remote possibility , at best . ( And this assumes that the travelers know precisely where each wormhole exists . ) In all probability , our intrepid explorers would never return to their starting point . If that is n't bad enough , time travelers might not even make it into a theoretically traversable wormhole . The primordial black holes described by Stephen Hawking would stop them in their tracks . Hawking showed that these tiny black holes actually emit particles and radiation . Particle pairs created from the black hole 's energy spontaneously form in the vacuum near the event horizon . If a spaceship approaches this region to access the wormhole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupants . Fortunately , this is a serious problem only if the black hole is extremely small . A TIDAL WAVE OF PROBLEMS But the wormholes linked to stellar-mass black holes create their own set of problems . If a spaceship approached one of these wormholes , severe tidal forces would pull the ship apart , along with all its inhabitants . These tidal forces are the same as the force that creates tides on Earth . The Moon 's gravity pulls on the near side of our planet stronger than on the far side . The net effect is that the Moon stretches Earth and its ocean waters into an oblong shape . Tidal forces arise anywhere there 's a source of gravity . Earth creates minuscule tidal forces in your own body , pulling stronger on your feet than on your head . Fortunately , the difference is so small that you ca n't feel it . If you stood on the surface of a much denser object , however , the tidal force would be significant . Near the surface of a neutron star , the force would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stellar-mass black hole is even more dense than a neutron star , so you would n't survive even a close approach to its event horizon . Obviously , no spaceship or passengers would make it as far as the entrance of a wormhole connected to a stellar-collapse black hole . But tidal forces are not as big a problem in the vicinity of more massive black holes . As the mass of the black hole increases , the tidal forces at its event horizon decrease . That 's because the radius of the event horizon increases with the black hole 's mass and tidal forces fall very rapidly with increasing distance from the central singularity . For a black hole of 10,000 solar masses , the tidal forces at its event horizon would be moderate and a human could pass through the horizon without discomfort . Safe passage is n't the only criterion for future time travelers , however . Astronomers suspect that black holes with masses of 10,000 solar masses or more lurk only in the cores of some galaxies . This means that the nearest candidate for a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our Galaxy . But black hole wormholes allow only one-way travel , so to have any hope of returning to Earth , the time travelers also need access to other wormholes . That means journeying into the cores of other galaxies . Though we need wormholes to travel long distances through space and time , the wormholes connected to massive black holes are separated by millions of light-years . Even if these wormholes offered the only hope for time travel , it would n't make much sense to use them . In many ways it looked hopeless . Not only did the possibility of time travel raise troubling theoretical paradoxes , but also the doorways to time travel  --  wormholes harbored by black holes  --  seemed shut by either lethal forces or enormous and essentially unconquerable distances . The problems proved so severe that scientists soon abandoned the idea of time travel . As far as they were concerned , time travel by way of black hole wormholes would forever remain beyond the reach of mankind . But that 's not the end of the story . A glimmer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's equations of general relativity found a way around the physical problems . If any wormholes exist apart from black holes , they conceivably can be made traversable . HAVE WORMHOLE , WILL TRAVEL The solution to the many problems came about almost by accident . In the early 1980s , Carl Sagan of Cornell University began writing his science fiction novel Contact . In the novel , heroine Ellie Arroway detected a radio signal from the vicinity of the star Vega . With some help , she managed to break the code and translate the message . The code contained instructions for building a " machine , " a machine that eventually took Ellie and several of her colleagues to a planet near Vega . In the original version of the book , Sagan used a wormhole associated with a black hole to get the group to Vega . As a scientist , he wanted to be sure that the science presented in the novel was as accurate as possible . He sent the manuscript to one of the foremost black hole experts in the world , Kip Thorne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look it over . Thorne was disturbed when he saw that Sagan used a black hole wormhole to transport the crew . Though Thorne knew the problems associated with these wormholes , he still wanted to help Sagan . So he wrote down Einstein 's equations and began looking for a solution others had overlooked  --  a solution that might allow time travel . And he found one . The solution was so simple he wondered why no had noticed it before . Einstein 's equations predicted that you could get around the pinch-off effect by using a wormhole that existed by itself and not in conjunction with a black hole . ( Though this wormhole , by itself , would not be a time machine . ) He sketched out the solution and left it to one of his students , Michael Morris , to fill in the details . Pinch-off was not the only problem the theorists had to overcome . To be traversable , the wormhole had to possess several properties . Thorne and Morris listed them : the wormhole had to have small tidal forces ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have an event horizon ; the time it took to travel through the wormhole had to be reasonable , from the point of view of both the time traveler and the people outside the wormhole ; any radiation effects had to be minimal ; and the wormhole had to be constructed with reasonable materials and within a reasonable period of time . The most serious problem was stopping the wormhole from pinching off . Thorne came to the conclusion that some sort of matter would have to be threaded through or applied to the surface of the wormhole . This would n't be just any sort of matter either  --  it would have to produce an outward pressure strong enough to contain the inward squeezing of the wormhole . Thorne found a solution to Einstein 's equations that allowed him to do this . Thorne and Morris soon devised a solution that met all the requirements on their list . The only problem is in the nature of the material needed to line the wormholes . It ca n't be ordinary matter . In fact it has to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The inward pressure on the tunnel is so great that the matter needed to counteract this pressure has to exert an outward tension comparable to the pressure at the center of a neutron star . This means the tension has to be greater than the total density of mass energy of the wormhole itself . Nothing on Earth even approaches this . However , thousands of years from now the production of such material might be routine . It appears possible , at least in principle , that one day humans will be able to traverse one of these wormholes . But that , by itself , wo n't transport us through time . We still have to make the wormhole into a time machine . The germ of the idea for doing this came from Thomas Roman , a theorist at Central Connecticut State University . At a conference in 1986 , he talked to Morris and learned about his and Thorne 's work on wormholes . Roman mentioned that special relativity could point the way to transforming wormholes into time machines . At first Morris did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , the more he liked the idea . Morris applied the tenets of special relativity to the concept of wormholes and discovered that someone entering two wormholes , one after the other , could travel back in time . He showed his calculations to Thorne and together they refined the idea . Eventually the two found that a single wormhole could be transformed into a time machine capable of transporting people into both the past and future , depending on which direction their spaceship traveled . The key to their discovery lay in what special relativity says about the rate of running clocks . If one clock moves relative to another at constant speed , an observer at rest near the stationary clock sees the moving clock tick off seconds at a slower rate . This leads to one of relativity 's more famous results  --  the twin paradox . Imagine a brother-and-sister set of twins who decide to test Einstein 's special theory . While the brother stays at home , the sister hops aboard a spaceship that rockets her away at a speed close to that of light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twin has aged much more than she has , with the exact difference depending on how fast she traveled and for how long . A FEASIBLE TIME MACHINE Thorne and Morris , together with Ulvi Yurtsever , another of Thorne 's students , discovered that the two mouths of a wormhole could act in much the same way as the twins . ( To an outside observer , the mouth of a wormhole would appear to be an ordinary object . ) The theorists found that if one of the mouths moved off into space at high speed and then returned to a point near the other mouth , the wormhole would become a time machine . To understand how this is possible , consider clocks both inside and outside the mouths of a wormhole . A clock just outside the stationary mouth does not move relative to the one just inside the mouth , so they will show the same time . By the exact same reasoning , a clock just outside the moving mouth will show will show the same time as a clock just inside the moving mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages more slowly than a stay-at-home twin , the clocks near the moving mouth will show an earlier time than the clocks near the stationary mouth . Even after the moving mouth returns to the vicinity of the stationary mouth and comes to rest , the clocks will forever read differently . So , if you enter through the mouth that has moved and exit through the stationary mouth , you will go back in time . You will come out of the second mouth before you entered the first one . In the same way , if you enter through the stationary mouth and exit through the mouth that has moved , you will go into the future . As in the case of the twin paradox , the amount of the effect depends on how fast and for how long the moving mouth traveled . For a significant effect , however , you have to get the mouth up to a speed near 99 percent that of light  --  obviously a task reserved for advanced civilizations that have mastered space travel and , presumably , the production of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . One way they might attempt this is with a large asteroid that gravitationally attracts the wormhole 's mouth . Start the mouth moving toward the asteroid , then accelerate the asteroid to great speed while keeping the mouth just out of reach . Another way would be to put some electrical charge on the wormhole , then use an oppositely charged object to attract it . Although time travel is possible with a wormhole of this type , remember that the clock at the moving mouth is just slowed down relative to the clock at the stationary mouth . Because of this , you could not travel back in time any further than the day the time machine was created . If you want to go back further , you have to hope that some ancient , advanced civilization has already created wormhole time machines  --  as happened in Sagan 's novel . So far we 've been talking about traversable wormholes as if they are fairly easy to make . They are n't . Unless we want to count on some hypothetical advanced civilization that 's already built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way to get a traversable wormhole . In their paper on wormholes , Morris , Thorne , and Yurtsever suggest a method . " One can imagine an advanced civilization pulling a wormhole out of the quantum foam and enlarging it to classical size , " they write . The quantum foam they refer to is a foam of space and nonspace  --  a fluctuating region filled with wormholes that exists on a scale much smaller than atoms . Although no theory directly postulates this foam , its existence seems to be a natural outgrowth of what we know about the theory of quantum gravity . And most physicists are convinced that the quantum foam exists . Even if it does exist , we must ask if we will ever be able to enlarge and stabilize a wormhole out of this foam . We 've overcome many problems just to see a way to travel through time , but formidable problems remain . Obviously , time travel is n't around the corner . But science and technology are advancing rapidly so it 's difficult to imagine what we will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present time scientists are not concerned about whether time travel is possible in the near future , but whether it is possible in principle . And at this stage the answer to that question appears to be yes . Barry Parker is a professor of physics and astronomy at Idaho State University .
