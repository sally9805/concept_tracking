Self-Sufficiency Will Improve Them <p> Our national parks are in trouble . Their roads , historic buildings , visitor facilities , and water and sewer systems are falling apart . The Park Service says it has a $4.5 billion backlog of construction improvements and an $800 million backlog of major maintenance . Even Yellowstone Park , the crown jewel of the national park system , is crumbling . Cost estimates to fix its pothole ridden roads run as high as $340 million . <p> What has gone wrong ? " Decades of forced neglect " is the answer given in a 1995 article in U.S. News &; World Report , implying that the parks have n't received enough money from Congress . <p> But Congress has n't been all that stingy . Indeed , since 1980 , the total budget for the National Park Service has nearly doubled , increasing from almost $700 million to about $1.3 billion . From 1980 to 1995 , spending on park operations grew at a healthy annual rate of 3.1% after adjusting for inflation , and full-time staff increased from 15,836 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spending for major park repairs and renovations fell at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 1.5% . It appears that long-term investment in our national parks has played second fiddle to bureaucratic growth . <p> In addition , the healthy increase in operating expenses has not led to better service in Yellowstone , Yosemite , and other popular parks . According to a recent Consumer Reports survey , the two most frequent complaints were crowded conditions and the lack of adequate visitor facilities . <p> This sad state of affairs is brought about because there has been no link between money earned from park visitors and costs . Congress is partially to blame . It severely limited the ability of the parks to generate and keep revenues . Until recently , they could not raise fees , charge fees for new programs and services , or market their unique natural amenities . The incentives inside the Park Service are perverse as well . Since the Park Service budget is largely derived from Congress , politicians , not park visitors , are the agency 's clientele . And , unlike a private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating costs and apply savings to needed improvements . It is a no-win situation for parks and the public , and a far cry from the original vision for the parks were to operate . <p> If we are to improve the condition of our parks , the incentives governing our parks must change . The goal should be to make them financially self-sufficient , supported by those who use them . <p> Self-Sufficiency Begins With Realistic Fees . Very simply , self-sufficiency means relying on park visitors , not Congress , for operating support . ( True self-sufficiency would mean covering the costs of capital improvements , too , but self-sufficiency in operations would be an important start . ) Attaining self-sufficiency will require , among other things , charging higher fees and practicing greater diligence in fee collection . <p> In the past , park fees have been a subject of controversy in the halls of Congress and state legislatures . But public sentiment has been changing . A 1995 nationwide survey by Colorado State University revealed that 80% of those surveyed did not oppose higher fees as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were collected . <p> When it comes to realistic fees that can support our national parks , we have a long way to go . In 1995 , proceeds from park recreation fees totaled $80.5 million , or about 7.5% of the total cost of park operations . At approximately 270 million park visitors , 1995 proceeds from all 369 parks represented an anemic 30 cents per visitor . <p> A primary reason for the low per-visitor return is the fact that over 200 park units did not charge entrance fees , and those that did charged by the carload per week . At $10 per vehicle , a family of four could visit in Yellowstone Park for a week for 36 cents per person per day in 1996 . Furthermore , entrance fees have failed to keep pace with inflation . Beginning January 1 , 1997 , Yellowstone 's annual vehicle pass , which provides the user unlimited visits for the year , was raised from $15 to $40 . But this hefty hike did not bring the price anywhere near the $133 ( in 1995 dollars ) that visitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit California 's state parks is more realistic . <p> If national parks are to be self-sufficient , park managers must not only be allowed to charge more realistic fees , they must be allowed to retain most of the proceeds to enhance their parks . Most of the receipts from fees go to the federal Treasury instead of the parks themselves . Most national parks give up 85% of their proceeds to the Treasury . Not being able to keep the lion 's share of the proceeds weakens the incentive for park managers to maximize revenue . <p> Indeed , a 1993 audit by the Department of Interior 's Office of Inspector General found that the Park Service collected $59 million from user fees in fiscal year 1991 , but it could have collected $105 million more from entrance fees alone without raising existing fees . One of the chief reasons was weak fee collection . Of the 136 units authorized to collect entrance fees  --  and retain only 15% of the proceeds  --  131 had made inadequate collection efforts . For example , fees were collected from only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from only 5% of the 356,238 vehicles that entered Cedar Breaks National Monument and Capitol Reef National Park . <p> Furthermore , hardly any national parks charge fees for popular activities such as hiking , nature tours , or fishing . Yet trails need upkeep , fisheries need monitoring , and interpreters have to be paid . An additional $123 million could have been collected if fees for these activities were charged , according to the audit . Supposed to Be Self-Sufficient <p> At first , the national parks were supposed to be self-supporting . Congressional appropriations were to be limited to initial investments in roads and visitor facilities . Ferdinand Hayden , one of the early explorers of Yellowstone , the country 's first national park , assured Congress that the park would require no appropriated funds . Yellowstone 's first superintendent , Nathaniel Langford , even suggested that toll roads be leased through the park to pay for road maintenance . <p> This attitude was still strong in 1916 when Congress authorized the creation of the National Park Service . Interior Secretary Franklin Lane appointed Stephen Mather to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mather ' s first report on parks to the secretary , he stated : " It has been your desire that ultimately the revenues of several parks might be sufficient to cover the costs of their administration and protection and that Congress should only be requested to appropriate funds for their improvement . It appears that at least five parks now have a proven earning capacity sufficiently large to make their operation on this basis feasible and practicable . " The five parks were Yellowstone , Yosemite , Mount Rainier , Sequoia , and General Grant ( now part of Kings Canyon/Sequoia ) . <p> By 1916 , at least seven parks had seasonal auto fees , from $2 in Glacier and Mesa Verde to $10 in Yellowstone ( $26 and $133 in 1995 dollars , respectively ) . Auto fees increased revenues , which reached over $65,000 in 1916 ( $858,000 in 1995 dollars ) . Mather noted that " no policy of national park management has yielded more thoroughly gratifying results than that which guided the admission of motor-driven vehicles to the use of the roads of all parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a special account , accessible to the Park Service without congressional appropriation , that could be used for road maintenance , park development , and administration . Mather considered agency control of the funds important for responsible management . But the legislation that created some parks  --  Rocky Mountain , Mesa Verde , Crater Lake , Hawaii Volcano , and Lassen  --  required these parks to turn their receipts over to the federal Treasury . Mather tried to persuade Congress that revenues collected at these parks should be returned to the parks , but he was unsuccessful . <p> Succumbing to Politics . It did n't take long for Congress to take full control of the purse strings . In 1918 , Congress began to require that all park fees revert to the federal Treasury . This broke the link between park revenues and park spending , and expenditures have been political footballs ever since . <p> In 1965 , the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act was passed to help finance the establishment of more parks . The act also redirected all national park user fees from the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act and subsequent amendments , Congress dictated what fees could be charged , how much could be charged , and which parks could charge them . Throughout the 1970s and 1980s , entrance fees were minimal , and sometimes not collected at all , and camping fees were permitted only in " developed " campgrounds . <p> A Reversal of Sorts . A reversal of sorts began in the early 1990s . Some parks discovered the benefits of charging fees for special use permits . Unlike other revenues , these receipts could stay in the park . Yellowstone , for example , began charging $5 for an annual fishing permit in 1994 . The program brought in $425,000 to the park in 1995 . The fee was doubled in 1996 , and revenues rose to $660,000 . In addition , beginning in 1993 , parks were allowed to keep 15% of fee revenues to pay for the cost of fee collection . <p> An even more important policy change came in 1996 when Congress authorized the Recreational Fee Demonstration Program , which went into effect January 1 , 1997 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 park units ( 93 of which have been selected so far ) to participate in a three-year fee demonstration program . Entrance fees at these parks have more than doubled , on average , and the price of annual park passes has nearly doubled . Some parks initiated entrance fees for the first time , and some began charging fees for the first time for interpretive nature programs , back-country use , boating , and snowmobiling . <p> While the fee demonstration program is a step in the right direction , it does not address all the obstacles that prevent popular national parks from becoming self-supporting . For one thing , it applies to only 100 out of 369 park units . Second , it allows only 80% of revenues above and beyond the historical base to remain inside the park . Most of the remaining amount goes to the federal Treasury , lessening the impact of fees on each park 's budget . The lion 's share of park operational funding still comes from tax dollars , and thus financial control of the parks remains with Congress . Finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs . Why Self-Sufficiency ? <p> There are several reasons why our park systems should move toward self-sufficiency . First , self-sufficiency would give park managers an incentive to provide more services and maintain parks in good condition . Park managers who depend on visitors for funds want them to have a memorable experience that brings them back . Unhappy customers will be less likely to return . <p> Self-sufficiency would also encourage more realistic pricing  --  that is , prices that cover the cost of services  --  and careful attention to collecting lawful fees . In contrast , a tax-financed park offers limited service , fails to collect fees , and encourages park overuse by subsidizing goods and services . <p> Self-sufficiency would also give park management an incentive to balance costs and benefits . Since costs must be covered out of revenues , managers would add services that covered costs and eliminate those that did n't . In contrast , when park operations are mostly funded by taxes , management can ignore such economic realities . In the summer of 1996 , Yellowstone Park managers closed a campground to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it cost to operate , but since the revenues went to the Treasury , not to the park , the managers had little incentive to keep it open . <p> Self-sufficiency would also free park managers from a major obstacle to protecting park resources  --  politics . Because most national park funding is controlled by Congress , park managers must cater to politicians and special interests . Politics is making it difficult to control runaway elk populations in Yellowstone and Rocky Mountain national parks , to keep " exotic " mountain goats from eating rare plants in Olympic National Park , and to protect wildlife from snowmobile use in Yellowstone Park . Self-sufficiency would give park management the incentives and the freedom to avoid congressional meddling . <p> Politics , in fact , tends to keep public funding low . Parks that rely on tax revenues for operating support are at the mercy of legislatures or Congress and the mood of the taxpayer . Public spending on state park systems averaged only two-tenths of a percent of total state spending in 1994 . As taxpayers rebel against higher taxes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding . And when public funds are appropriated , they tend to flow to bureaucratic support and not to the parks themselves . <p> Self-sufficiency alone , however , will not necessarily lead to the lowest possible costs . Unlike private business , government managers are not motivated to maximize " profits . " To deal with this problem , some state park systems have created incentives for government managers to find cost savings or have " contracted out " park support functions to private-sector organizations that can provide services at lower cost . These actions are in addition to the move toward self-sufficiency . <p> The great benefit of self-sufficiency is that it is a spur to provide more services . While it is difficult to say whether a park with many services is " better " than a park with fewer services , revenues tend to grow . This indicates that the parks with more services are pleasing their customers . At the same time , we have found no evidence that greater services damage the environment of the parks ; indeed , the greater flexibility and availability of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since 1980 , many state park systems have felt the pinch of fiscally tight legislatures . As general support lagged , state park managers began to rely more on fees . In 1980 , user fees collected at all state parks totaled $181.7 million , or about 17% of total park spending . Fourteen years later , in 1994 , user fees totaled $637.9 million , or about 33% of total park spending . <p> Sixteen park systems regularly obtain more than half their operating costs from user fees . These include New Hampshire , Alabama , Arkansas , Colorado , Kentucky , Michigan , Nebraska , Oklahoma , South Carolina , South Dakota , Tennessee , Texas , Indiana , West Virginia , Wisconsin , and Vermont . In fact , both New Hampshire and Vermont fund their entire operating budgets out of user fees . ( See box , above . ) <p> In spite of this trend , many states still receive only a small return per visitor . Alabama , New Hampshire , and Vermont collected more than $4 per visitor in 1994 . States such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected less than 27 cents per visitor , and the National Park Service collected 28 cents per visitor . One reason for these low average returns is the failure to collect an entrance fee from many day visitors . The percentage of day visitors not paying entrance fees at parks in Alaska , Pennsylvania , and Wyoming was 91% , 95% , and 68% respectively . Back To The Future <p> Only by making those who run our parks financially accountable to users can we spur effective management and stable funding for our parks . Toward that end , we recommend several policy changes . If enacted , they would unleash entrepreneurial abilities , increase revenues , save money , and enable park managers to refurbish visitor facilities and protect natural resources . <p> Congress should establish a fixed schedule that gradually reduces annual appropriations for park operations over a 10-year period until they reach zero . Removing the dependency on general funds spurred several state park systems to become more self-sufficient . The Park Service has to face the same reality . <p> Congress should allow park managers to institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collected in these parks , about 95% , should remain in the park in which they are collected , to be used to fund operations there . A small amount , perhaps 5% , could be used to fund system-wide administration . Any revenues in excess of costs should be retained by the parks . <p> Park managers should be allowed to keep all cost savings and apply them to their budgets for subsequent years . These funds would be treated as budget enhancements , not offsets to subsequent state funding . <p> Each park should have a special " park endowment fund " for capital improvements and repairs . Profits from user fee revenue , concessionaire sales , as well as park-road tolls could contribute to the fund . Interest from the fund would be used for annual repair and renovation of buildings and roads . Allocations from the Treasury have a way of going to the creation of new parks instead of maintaining existing ones . Giving park managers a capital fund dedicated to an individual park and the wherewithal to finance it can avoid this problem . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commercially valued assets to be self-supporting . If these parks are to remain public , they should be funded separately out of general funds and not be subsidized by high-use parks . Another option is to turn them over to private , non-profit groups , with a one-time endowment fund for maintenance . <p> Requiring popular parks to be self-sustaining is the surest way of spurring responsible management and financial stability . This is , after all , what Stephen Mather and other early park supporters had in mind near the turn of the century when we were a much poorer nation than we are today . Surely , with our higher incomes today , we as users can afford to pay for these amenities and help make our parks the treasures they should be . A Self-Supporting Park System <p> New Hampshire State Parks is an agency that is legislatively mandated to be self-supporting . The system 's 89 recreational , historical , and natural sites cover nearly 75,000 acres of land , and there are more than 6,000 miles of trails . The park system attracts about 1.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas , with several sites on the National Register of Natural Landmarks . <p> New Hampshire finances all of its nearly $5 million operating budget from fees , and has some left over for construction improvements . It was the first to implement different prices for campsites , reflecting the different levels of amenities offered and the different levels of demand for various parks . It was one of the first park systems to charge entrance fees per person instead of per vehicle . In 1996 , prices for campsites ranged from $12 to $30 , and entrance fees were $2.50 per adult . The annual pass to all state parks costs $35 . ( Children 12 years and under and resident adults over 65 are admitted free . ) <p> Although New Hampshire has a long history of heavy user support , mandated self-sufficiency did not come until 1991 . In the midst of a growing general fund crisis , the legislature required the park system to rely solely on park-generated revenue . Park revenue had actually exceeded operating expenditures for three consecutive years prior to passage of the act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state treasury . The 1991 act let receipts flow into a park fund that carries over unspent park moneys from year to year . This encourages self-sufficiency because park officials know they have a reliable source of money dedicated to parks over the long term . <p> In addition to operations , some major maintenance and capital improvements are now being financed through park income . Allison McLain , Director of Recreation Services , calls the current backlog of park maintenance and capital projects " manageable , " averaging $333,000 per park , but growing . <p> The system has taken other initiatives to make ends meet . It has an extensive donor program and an ever-growing system of partnerships with companies . In 1992 , volunteers contributed $2.8 million in labor and private funds . <p> An example of company partnerships is the recent agreement with PepsiCo , Inc. , which has an exclusive five-year right to beverage sales in all state parks . PepsiCo won this agreement through a competitive bid process . As part of its proposal , the company promised to fund an education and awareness program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leal and Holly Lippke Fretwell <p> <p> Mr. Leal is a Senior Associate and Ms. Fretwell a Research Associate at the Political Economy Research Center , or PERC , based in Bozeman , Mont .
