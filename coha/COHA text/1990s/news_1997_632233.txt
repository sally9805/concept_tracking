<p> For most of us , plunking down big bucks for a boxed set is not something we do without a little , shall we say , forethought . While retail prices vary , expect to pay $ 11-$ 15 per disc . Even beyond the money , there 's the time element . If you 're going to listen to hours and hours of the same artist , it had better be good . To help you wade through all the multidisc offerings out there  --  and there are a lot of them  --  the Sun-Times music staff compiled a list of this year 's most notable boxed set offerings . <p> FOR FANATICS ONLY <p> The Beach Boys , " The Pet Sounds Sessions " <p> ( Capitol ) Pop <p> This being the holiday season , let 's err on the side of kindness by ranking this box as a must . If you 're a Beach Boys obsessive like me  --  the kind of fan who owns all the albums , plus the first box set , and has read at least three or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the best Christmas gift ever . But if you 're a novice who just wants to find out why many people consider " Pet Sounds " one of rock 's indisputable masterpieces , this four-disc box is overkill , and at $ 65 , you might even consider it a ripoff . <p> Released in 1966 , before " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band , " which it partly inspired , " Pet Sounds " is a touching and tender plea for love and understanding . Back in the early ' 90s , it was remastered and reissued on CD ; that mono mix is included here , along with the gem of this collection , a new stereo mix . Then there are 34 tracks of instrumental backings and first takes ; 11 tracks of a cappella vocals , and 19 alternate versions of the 13 finished songs . As indicated by David Leaf 's extensive liner notes , the intention is to allow the listener an unprecedented glimpse at how the album was constructed . But it 's hard to imagine this extra material appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners are best advised to enjoy the existing single-disc " Pet Sounds , " or wait until the new stereo mix is released as a single disc . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> Bill Evans , " The Complete Bill Evans on Verve " <p> ( Verve ) Jazz <p> Destined to be remembered as much for design as content  --  it is housed in an industrial-strength box  --  this 18-CD set contains music recorded between 1962 and ' 70 by the enormously influential pianist . Boasting no fewer than 98 previously unreleased cuts , Evans ' fifth box set comprises mostly trio performances . It also includes overdubbed " conversations " and orchestral and vocal efforts to which he lent support . The compilers chose not to include a commercially motivated album of movie themes because it lacked artistic merit . They should have let us be the judge of that . When you reach this level of excess , is taste really a consideration , anyway ? <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> Paul O'Dette , " John Dowland , Complete Lute Works " <p> ( Harmonia Mundi ) Classical <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you insane ? Well , that 's what I thought , too , but I put this set in , and suddenly , two discs had gone by before I knew it . Clearly , this is music for fans of the lute , or those who can recognize the beautifully extreme delicacy of Dowland 's writing . <p> Kevin M. Williams <p> Various artists , " Complete Beethoven Edition " <p> ( Deutsche Grammophon ) <p> Classical <p> With its exquisite , gargantuan excess , this is the ultimate box set for you or someone on your list . Contemplate , if you will , everything written by Ludwig van Beethoven . Not excerpts , but every last note . If you do the math , it 's about 106 hours of Beethoven , separated into 20 volumes . And get this . The cost is a mere $ 950 . <p> Kevin M. Williams <p> WORTH THE BUCKS <p> Ray Charles , " Genius &; Soul : The 50th Anniversary <p> Collection , 1949-1993 " <p> ( Rhino ) Soul/pop/jazz <p> It fades in the homestretch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decades-long achievement of the great American original , " Genius &; Soul " qualifies as the box set of the season . It 's all here : Charles ' astonishing breakthroughs of the ' 50s , when he invented soul ; his forays into big band jazz , country and sanctified pop ; his duets and movie themes and " America the Beautiful . " The discs number five , the epiphanies to the nth degree . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> John Coltrane , " The Complete 1961 Village Vanguard <p> Recordings " <p> ( Impulse ! ) Jazz <p> Such are the glories of John Coltrane 's Vanguard performances that no one who enters the famous New York club can yet escape their shadow . This four-CD set documents the historic five-night stand when the saxophonist staked out his own turf after leaving the employ of Miles Davis . Coltrane 's solo on " Chasin ' the Trane " and exchanges with Eric Dolphy are legendary . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> Paul Desmond , " The Complete RCA Quartet Recordings of Paul Desmond featuring Jim Hall " <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound , because he was so professorial-looking and maybe because he was white , altoist Paul Desmond ( best known for his work with Dave Brubeck ) never acquired the serious reputation he deserved . On the lovely , transcendentally lyrical albums collected on this five-CD set , recorded between 1959 and 1965 , he teams with guitarist Jim Hall on standards , expansive orchestrations , bossa nova and beyond . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> Benny Goodman , " The Complete RCA Victor Small Group Recordings " <p> ( RCA ) Jazz <p> Recorded between 1935 and 1939 , these three discs document Goodman 's ascent as one of jazz 's most brilliant soloists  --  and his virtual invention of chamber jazz with pianist Teddy Wilson , drummer Gene Krupa and vibist Lionel Hampton . Twenty of the 67 tracks are alternate takes , too high a percentage for comfort . But you can never feast on the wondrous Goodman-Wilson partnership too much . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> Phillipe Herreweghe , <p> " Requiem " <p> ( Harmonia Mundi ) Classical <p> Herreweghe 's authentic-performance practices put the lie to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His readings of the Mozart , Brahms and Faure requiem masses absolutely crackle with fire and vitality . Fans of vibrato , which original instrumenteers avoid like the plague , will want to stay clear of this four-CD set . But the Collegium Vocale is a beautifully trained ensemble , and when they 're having the spurs put to them by Herreweghe 's La Chapelle Royale , there 's never a dull moment . This beautifully packaged set will gobble up an afternoon before you know it . <p> Kevin M. Williams <p> Charles Mingus , " Passions of a Man : The Complete Atlantic Recordings 1956-1961 " <p> ( Rhino ) Jazz <p> Bass virtuoso/composer Charles Mingus aspired to the coloristic sophistication of Duke Ellington while stroking his own battering muse . The six-CD " Passions " documents the flowering and most sustained expression of his oversized musical personality . It takes in temperamental early masterpieces such as " Pithecanthropus Erectus , " harmonically heated standards , Mingus ' killer band with Eric Dolphy and the first CD appearance of a supporting turn with vibist Teddy Charles . Disc six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sachs <p> New York Philharmonic , " Historic Broadcasts " <p> ( Available only from the New York Philharmonic : 800-557-8268 , fax 203-877-1601 , or at **27;428;TOOLONG or Tower Records . ) Classical <p> This 10-CD set evinces the chameleonlike nature of a great orchestra . Depending on whose hands are wielding the baton , the New York Philharmonic can be anything from intense and visceral to uncertain and sluggish . Culled from the orchestra 's live radio broadcasts , these 12 hours of performances from 1923 to ' 87 feature legendary conductors such as Fritz Reiner , Leonard Bernstein , Rafael Kubelik , Otto Klemperer and pretty much anybody else you can think of . Any doubts about whether this set is worth the money are immediately quelled by the first selection , Beethoven 's " Corolianus " overture , conducted by Willem van Hoogstraten . The energy present in this resurrected , digitally remastered broadcast will give you goosebumps . The sound of the early broadcasts is spotty , but the musical quality makes any sonic nattering superfluous . <p> Kevin M. Williams <p> Herbie Nichols , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Jazz The perennial hands-down winner of jazz 's Most Neglected Genius Award , pianist Herbie Nichols coined a unique trio sound through his use of brilliant offbeat harmonies and an uncanny ability to lay back as he spun the music forward . Sadly , these recordings ( featuring Art Blakey and Max Roach ) , here on a three-disc set , and one later album are his entire output . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> Psychedelic Furs , " Should God Forget : A Retrospective " <p> ( Columbia/Legacy ) Rock <p> My choice for box set bargain of the season , this two-disc collection includes all the Psychedelic Furs you need to own , spanning the group 's career from post-punk drone masters ( " Imitation of Christ , " " India " ) to postmodern glam-rockers ( " Pretty in Pink , " " The Ghost in You " ) . <p> OK , so the Furs were n't a major band . They were still a heck of a singles act , and I guarantee you 'll find yourself swept away and singing along with these 33 well-chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to portray the group as the missing link between the Sex Pistols and Nirvana . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> Sonny Rollins , " The Complete Sonny Rollins RCA Victor <p> Recordings " <p> ( RCA ) Jazz <p> Such is the wonder of Rollins , several of his periods can be argued as his greatest . During this brief but prolific one , spanning 1962-64 , he responded to the free jazz challenge after a two-year hiatus by teaming with Ornette Coleman sidemen Don Cherry and Billy Higgins on the monumental " Our Man in Jazz . " He also tested tradition opposite his idol , Coleman Hawkins , played off the lyrical voice of guitarist Jim Hall and deepened his involvement in Latin and Caribbean music . Not everything on this five-disc set is golden , but what is n't still glows . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> Mstislav Rostropovich , " The Russian Years , 1950-1974 " <p> ( EMI ) Classical <p> You know you want this 13-CD set . Imagine the greatest cellist to ever live cherry-picking from a vast array of his best performances . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw-dropping technique are all here , in hour after hour of marvelous musicmaking . Everything from Dmitri Shostakovich and Benjamin Britten to Galina Ustvolskaya and Lev Knipper is represented here . These performances , taken from the vaults of Russian 's Ostankino Radio Archive , capture Slava at the top of his game , in heretofore unavailable performances . <p> Kevin M. Williams <p> Dusty Springfield , " The Dusty Springfield Anthology " <p> ( Mercury/Chronicles ) Pop <p> Long before mopes such as Tori Amos and Sarah McLachlan , there was the cool pop-soul of Dusty Springfield . Born Mary O'Brien in London in 1939 , the Duster had tons of mid- ' 60s hits such as " I Only Want To Be With You , " " You Do n't Have To Say You Love Me " and " Stay Awhile " ( a hit for Rachel Sweet ) . <p> Springfield hit her stride in 1968 after leaving Philips for Atlantic Records , where producer Jerry Wexler teamed her up with the Muscle Shoals Rhythm Section . Those songs are among the highlights of this three-CD set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Preacher Man , " and her take on the Donnie Fritts-Eddie Hinton composition is flat-out sexy . But do n't overlook the way she drives her intrepid alto through spritely interpretations of Barbara Acklin 's " Am I the Same Girl ? " ( popularized in 1992 by Swing Out Sister ) and Thom Bell-Jerry Butler 's " A Brand New Me , " recorded in 1969 under the auspices of Philadelphia 's Gamble &; Huff . <p> Dave Hoekstra <p> Various artists , " The Anthology of American Folk Music " <p> ( Smithsonian Folkways ) Folk <p> This six-CD box set is a must for all serious fans of American roots music . Originally issued in 1952 , the 84 tracks were recorded and edited between 1926 and ' 31 by the nomadic filmmaker and ethnomusciologist Harry Smith . Viewing artists as fertile products of their environment , Smith paid no attention to race , style or fashion , which is what gives this box set its staying power . The anthology was a building block for the songbooks of Bob Dylan , Joan Baez and Jerry Garcia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Dave Hoekstra <p> Various artists , " Beg Scream &; Shout : The Big Ol ' Box of ' 60s Soul " <p> ( Rhino ) Soul <p> This six-CD set featuring 144 tracks by 144 different artists is essential for anyone interested in exploring the inherent longing of 1960s soul music . This was an era when the voice mattered in black music  --  forget synthesizers , drum machines or hard-charging rock guitars . Just about everything is here , ranging from a stunningly funky Jackson 5 version of Smokey Robinson 's " Who 's Lovin You , " to the late great O.V. Wright  --  a major influence on Chicago 's Otis Clay . Chicagoans Tyrone Davis , the Impressions and Clay are included , but a minor quibble is that the project did n't go deeper into ChiTown soul by including LaVern Baker , Billy Stewart , etc . <p> Dave Hoekstra <p> Various artists , " The Philly Sound : Kenny Gamble , Leon Huff &; the Story of Brotherly Love ( 1966-1976 ) " <p> ( Epic/Legacy ) Soul <p> Kenny Gamble and Leon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of help from friends including the O'Jays , Harold Melvin &; the Blue Notes ( including Teddy Pendergrass ) and Billy " Me and Mrs. Jones " Paul , the Philadelphia producers also turned out soul-intensive moral statements . Punched up by their signature strings , the songs frequently overwhelm with their social , political and satiric intensity without sacrificing their infectious pop appeal . This three-CD set shows how house artists as well as outsiders including the Jacksons , Laura Nyro and Wilson Pickett took to the Gamble &; Huff touch . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> SLIGHTLY IFFY <p> AC/DC , " Bonfire " <p> ( EastWest ) Rock <p> Plenty of critics have joked that Australian head-bangers AC/DC only really had one song , so why on earth would anyone need a box set ? But fans know how good that one song could be , so why not celebrate its many subtle variations ? <p> Unfortunately , this box is not a comprehensive overview of AC/DC 's career . It focuses on the band 's early years with original singer Bon Scott , including three discs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix of metal , punk and blues . This is good stuff , but the inclusion of a fourth disc with 1980s classic " Highway to Hell " makes you yearn for more of the band 's concentrated studio firepower . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> Cream , " Those Were the Days " <p> ( Polydor ) Rock <p> Cream is responsible for popularizing some of the worst trends in rock history : endless guitar and drum solos and the blind worship of instrumental prowess inherent in the very idea of a " supergroup . " But Jack Bruce , Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker also were capable of crafting wonderful , concise , hard-rocking psychedelic singles such as " White Room , " " Badge " and " Sunshine of Your Love . " This four-disc box set gives you an overview of both the good and the bad . It includes all the band 's studio efforts in one handy package , and those are indeed well worth owning . But the extensive live sets ( much of which have been released before ) are all of dubious merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have been if only its members had checked their considerable egos . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> Phil Ochs , " Farewell and <p> Fantasies " <p> ( Rhino/Elektra Traditions ) Folk <p> On this three-CD retrospective , it 's compelling to hear Ochs acknowledge influences such as Woody Guthrie in " Bound for Glory " and " Links on the Chain , " which Ochs sang to Guthrie on his death bed . And Billy Bragg has obviously studied the political acumen of Ochs ' " Santo Domingo . " <p> But " William Butler Yeats Visits Lincoln Park and Escapes Uscathed " is a madrigal kind of spooky , a song that 's regarded as the turning point in Ochs ' life . That song was written and recorded in 1968 ; eight years later , Ochs was dead at 35 , after hanging himself in his sister 's bathroom . <p> " Farewell and Fantasies " scores extra points for this year 's best box set booklet , a sterling 96 pages that includes commentary from Ochs ' daughter and memorable pictures from his brother Michael 's photo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elvis Presley Platinum : A Life in Music " <p> ( RCA ) Rock <p> The only genuine retrospective set , " Platinum " follows the once and future King from his early years to the final curtain . Where previous RCA collections focused on his work from specific decades , " Platinum " strips down Elvis to his purest essence  --  raw , vital and untamed . Though heavy on alternate and live tracks , the four-disc set proves why 20 years after , Elvis still matters . <p> Laura Emerick <p> Simon and Garfunkel , " Old Friends " <p> ( Columbia ) Pop/folk <p> Old friends ? These guys are n't even speaking to each other . Merry Christmas , holiday shoppers . The big news in this triple-CD box set of 59 songs is the unearthing of the previously unreleased " Blues Run the Game , " a dark 1965 road ballad written by singer-songwriter Jackson C. Frank , a compatriot of Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and an influence on the likes of Nick Drake . All the S &G; hits are here , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early years , such as their interplay on traditionals , including " Peggy-O . " <p> Dave Hoekstra <p> Various artists , " Centenary Edition : 100 Years of Great Music " <p> ( EMI ) Classical <p> This 11-disc set is precisely what it claims , excerpts from the label 's stable of marvelous recordings , released to celebrate EMI 's 100th anniversary . These 11 discs feature extraordinary performances of gems such as Enrico Caruso 's 1902 " Vesti la giubba " or composer Edvard Grieg playing his own piano work " To Spring . " From today 's era , we get bits of finery such as an excerpt from Mstislav Rostropovich 's otherworldly Bach Cello Suites , or Klaus Tennstedt 's ethereal Mahler Symphony No. 8 . The upside to this set is that it offers a lot of great music . The downside , if there can be said to be one , is that many brilliant complete works are merely excerpted . <p> Kevin M. Williams <p> Various artists , " The Sugar Hill Records Story " <p> ( Rhino ) Funk/rap <p> Sugar Hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 83 , yet it is now the subject of a 56-song , five-CD set . Certainly that must rank as some kind of record . Sadly , one of the most revealing aspects of the box set is the label 's inability to evolve from its extended hard funk loops , a sound that was most appropriate for its beginnings as a 12-inch singles label . <p> Dave Hoekstra <p> TAKE A PASS <p> The Doors , " The Doors " <p> ( Elektra ) Rock <p> Four CDs of greatest hits you already own , plus several live sets you 'd just as soon miss , and a " new " track that 's as contrived , worthless and necrophiliac as the Beatles ' " Free As a Bird . " The Lizard King would be appalled if he were still around . <p> Jim DeRogatis <p> Keith Jarrett , " The Impulse Years , 1973-1974 " <p> ( Impulse ! ) Jazz <p> When it fired on all cylinders , pianist Keith Jarrett 's American quartet attained a probing intensity while navigating among free jazz , gospel-tinged mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-CD collection , he and bandmates Dewey Redman , Charlie Haden and Paul Motian were not always on the same page . The best " book " here is the live-at-the-Vanguard " Fort Yawuh , " expanded to two discs via restored edits and previously unreleased tracks . <p> Lloyd Sachs <p> Rahsaan Roland Kirk , " Dog Years in the Fourth Ring " <p> ( 32 Jazz ) Jazz <p> Producer Joel Dorn 's latest serving of unearthed live performances by the iconoclastic reed and flute player is enjoyable but nonessential . Taped by a fan in 1961-75 , " Dog Years " features Rahsaan Roland Kirk detonating jazz classics with his time bomb wit and fevered soul on two of the set 's three discs . His conceptualism is served by the CD debut of " Natural Black Inventions : Root Strata , " a woolly and reflective 1971 effort featuring him in a mostly unaccompanied setting . Lloyd Sachs <p> Peter Tosh , <p> " Honorary Citizen " <p> ( Columbia/Legacy ) Reggae <p> Murdered a decade ago , reggae star Peter Tosh is the subject of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 44 tracks are from his two Columbia albums . The remainder includes 19 obscure Jamaican titles recorded between 1967 and 1980 , and 11 live performances , always the bane of the box set world . Of marginal interest is Tosh 's vamping of Richie Havens on an obscure 1971 cover of the Beatles ' " Here Comes the Sun . " And fans of Chicago 's Kinsey Report will want to check out the live 1983 doo-wop version of " Johnny B. Goode . But if Tosh were still alive , much of this material would not have seen the light of day . <p> Dave Hoekstra
