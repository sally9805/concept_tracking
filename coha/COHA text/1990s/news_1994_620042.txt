<p> ' HOW TO KEEP THE VOTERS BACK HOME HAPPY ' <p> Editor  --  Could Clinton do better ? <p> He could easily appear to many to be able to do so by : <p> 1 . Ignoring the population explosion which is rapidly destroying our world , by denying help to the needy here and abroad on birth control . His predecessors did so . <p> 2 . He could ignore unwanted large families and women 's rights by taking no stand on abortion . <p> 3 . He and Babbitt could let our streams , our air and our forests be destroyed by taking no stand on clear-cutting and the continued gift , for private profit , of our national forests and other natural resources . <p> 4 . He could let our treasury and nation go bankrupt and let our grandchildren try to pay our bills with what resources are left , by continuing to subsidize a health and farm system not only when needed but when and where they are being unmercifully milked without need . <p> 5 . He could ignore the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich as well as the poor out of deficit spending  --  by adding to our debt . <p> 6 . He could continue the practice of adding $ 200 billion in annual interest on the debt , to the total of that debt . <p> 7 . He could ignore the need of 35 million of our citizens for health care , which they can not afford . <p> 8 . He could further defer resuming wartime taxes on that part of our current income which comes from the gift to this generation of a scientific , social , capital and other infrastructure which is such a large factor in producing such income . Must we pretend that we did it all ? <p> Is that posture what is needed to sustain democracy ? Must this and future presidents be irresponsible to keep " the voters back home " happy ? Must a majority of our well- informed people in Congress be equally irresponsible ? <p> SAMUEL W. GARDINER <p> San Rafael <p> . <p> TRUTHTELLING ABOUT GAYS <p> Editor  --  I have a bone to pick with Charles Hummer ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headline , " Senate votes to punish schools that teach intolerance , " as a misleading characterization of what the Helms amendment would actually do . What it would actually do is prohibit the schools ' suggesting that gays and lesbians can and frequently do lead happy and productive lives . Helms and his supporters would like to smother this heresy . In other words , prohibit schools from telling the truth . <p> What is the net effect of being truthful about homosexuality ? The very few homosexual kids in the school will be less inclined to self- loathing and suicide . The great majority of heterosexual kids will grow up less ignorant about this aspect of human sexuality . Indeed , they may one day have friends or relatives  --  even children  --  who are gay or lesbian . It 's hard to know who is served by demonizing homosexuals . The pope with his highly suspect clergy ? Right-wing pols whose Communist antagonists have closed up shop ? Televangelists who need to keep those dollars rolling in ? Ordinary Joes and Jills who need to ennoble their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> . <p> CHALLENGING A ' TRUTH ' <p> Editor  --  I wish to reply to the letter on August 8 entitled , " It 's a Life , Not a Lifestyle . " In it the thought was expressed , " ( Gayness ) . . . , as we all know , is a naturally occurring phenomenon , . . . ( and ) a God-given blessing . " <p> But , I would like to challenge this " obvious truth . " Why have so many former gays been able to change to heterosexuals ( a fact unmentioned by the liberal press ) by using their conservative faith ? <p> The obvious fact , rather , is that we are all born with varying degrees of homo-hetero tendencies . Early in our sexual maturation we can become influenced either way , if we have the capacity to be of either persuasion . It is n't a matter of saying , " Let 's see , I think I 'll be gay , " but rather the course of least resistance . <p> My point is that young teens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be and such support groups need to be available to them . We are n't doing them a favor by encouraging the gay lifestyle . And yet , we must not permit gay-bashing . <p> BEVERLY HART <p> Lafayette <p> . <p> PROP . 187 IS A COMPLEMENT <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle 's headline , " Immigration Measure Would Cost Schools  --  California Could Lose Billions in U.S. Aid Over Privacy Issue " ( August 13 ) , is an excellent example of linguistic duplicity . Which is it , would or could ? I think neither . <p> The legal opinion stated in the article referred to a recent state Senate Office of Research report ; but any report which states its findings as " appears , may , might and could " is hardly definitive . <p> A 1982 Supreme Court decision stated that any child of school age residing in the United States is entitled to a free public education . The ruling does not mean that the federal government can not or should not make an effort to identify illegal aliens . Plyer vs . Doe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrators , not teachers , will be required to ask for proof of citizenship or legal resident status from every applicant ; but they already ask for a birth certificate , immunization record and proof of residency . Prop . 187 complements current requirements and is not invasive . <p> Finally , President Clinton is not going to deny California millions of federal dollars as he prepares for re-election . <p> PATRICK SKAIN <p> Bay Area Coalition <p> for Immigration Reform <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ' A SIMPLE SOLUTION ' <p> Editor  --  Denying health care and education to the children of illegal immigrants will not solve our economic problems , nor will it make the children disappear . It will just make their lives harder . Instead of being in school , they will be wandering the streets unsupervised and uneducated . And they will be getting sick . If they are not treated , we could end up with major health problems for our entire community . <p> Hitler identified the Jews as responsible for Germany 's economic ills , and got the support of ordinary citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe the solution was that simple , and so do we . We have identified the illegal immigrants as the cause of our problems and have set about getting rid of them in our own way . <p> But what if 187 does n't work ? What if it passes and we still have the economic problems , plus the new social problems we have created through this legislation ? Would we round up the illegal immigrants and lock them away ? <p> We did just that to the Japanese Americans during World War II . We justified our actions by saying we were at war with Japan . What justification will we need to act more repressively toward the illegal immigrants ? Let 's not start down the road of repression . Let 's defeat 187 . <p> DIANE SWENSON <p> San Anselmo <p> . <p> ' WE 'RE ALL CARPETBAGGERS ' <p> Editor  --  Since I am a disgusted average alienated voter and do n't care for either Huffington or Feinstein , I was happy , at least , to see a letter in the paper ( Letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no less a millionaire than Huffington . It would be swell if average people governed , but they do n't  --  it takes too much effort just to pay the bills and put bread on the table . So , until the day that we have government-financed elections , we 'll just have to deal with almost total rule by rich people . <p> But while we are at it , should n't we dismiss the carpet-bagger criticism hurled at Huffington ? I thought that California does n't care where anyone came from . I came from the East Coast , and almost everyone I know came from somewhere else , too : all 50 states plus every imaginable foreign country . Are we now to be shamed in the papers and denied rights and privileges because we are not blue- blood , native-born Californians ? Give me a break . <p> CHRISTOPHER KOX <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> JAZZ , A TO C <p> Editor  --  Since no one else seems to have the nerve , I guess it remains for me to be the Grinch at the grieving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a total jazz nut for some 40 years , 22 of them spent in the Bay Area , and it has always seemed to me that for at least 95 percent of their playing time , KJAZ represented the range of jazz from A to C. For the great part boring , unadventurous and relentlessly middle-of-the-road , KJAZ 's programming seems to have been based on a few simple principles : nothing that was n't , or could n't have been , played 30 years ago , and nothing that was played over 40 years ago . If Bob Parloccha ( KJAZ 's long-time program director ) can show me that in the past 20 years KJAZ played , even once , any record by Jelly Roll Morton ( the first great jazz composer ) or the post- 1965 Cecil Taylor ( the most important jazz figure of our time ) any day between the hours of 8 and 10 p.m. , I will join in the grieving . If he ca n't . . . well , hasta la vista , squares . <p> CHRIS BREYER <p> Inverness
