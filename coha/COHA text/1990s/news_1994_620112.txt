<p> JOURNALISM AND THE STRUGGLE FOR JUSTICE <p> Editor  --  I would be quick to agree with Rabbi Stephen S. Pearce ( Open Forum , October 15 ) that journalists can provide an important bulwark against injustice . <p> But I would be less optimistic in expecting today 's press to show the courage and dedication to justice of the French journalist Emile Zola , who came to the defense of Captain Alfred Dreyfus 100 years ago . <p> I come to this unhappy conclusion from personal experience with the press and the police/court system and also from what seems to be a steady stream of reports in the news about men who have served many years in prison  --  sometimes on Death Row  --  before the state admits it made a mistake and sets them free . <p> Do these convicts owe their freedom to some vigilant and dedicated journalist ? No . <p> Why is this ? Let 's say police have been a little slow in solving a case that ( because of the media ) has caught the public fancy . Then police say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and the public ) all the reasons why they " know " he is guilty . In the weeks before the trial , more incriminating " facts " leak out . <p> Comes the trial . Prospective jurors tell the court they have some doubts about the defendant but are sure they can hear testimony with an " open mind . " This " open mind " idea has been exploded by many social science studies and by occasional candid remarks of trial lawyers , but acceptance of the myth is crucial to our system . <p> And who are the Zolas covering the police reports and the trial ? Usually the same folks who cover the police and district attorney day in and day out . But of course , being pals with news sources never compromised a reporter 's objectivity . <p> Combine all this with everyone 's ( media-induced ) dread of seeming " soft on crime , " and it is n't surprising that the machinery of justice sometimes grinds up the innocent . <p> JACK PAGE <p> Oakland <p> SMOKING GUN <p> EDitor  --  When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to pass a law , it is reasonable to ask what 's in it for them . The answer is certainly not " tough statewide smoking restrictions " as the industry claims . Only someone who believes that Saddam Hussein and the tooth fairy are one and the same would believe that the tobacco industry is spending all that money so that people will have less opportunity to smoke . <p> The reality is that Proposition 188 would emasculate 20 years of hard work by citizens and public officials in hundreds of communities in the state to improve the public health . Just when most of us thought it was safe again to breathe in public places , along comes the industry to perpetrate a cruel hoax . <p> They want to fool Californians into voting for a measure that would subject them to the harmful effects of secondhand smoke almost everywhere they go , under the pretense of being a measure to protect them from secondhand smoke . <p> PETER HANAUER <p> Past President <p> Americans for Nonsmokers ' Rights <p> Berkeley <p> RED FLAG ON IMMIGRATION <p> Editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California at Riverside , opponents of Proposition 187 called for the repeal of employer sanctions and a change in funding priorities away from border enforcement . <p> Simply by qualifying for the ballot , Proposition 187 has provided California taxpayers with the greatest catalyst for change in more than a decade . It has forced politicians to acknowledge the costs associated with illegal immigration and caused the opponents of the measure to support enforcement of employer sanctions and improved border security . <p> To stop illegal immigration , we must enforce employer sanctions and secure our borders , but we must also address the ever-increasing cost of benefits provided to illegal aliens . Most of our politicians have lacked the courage to meet this challenge . <p> Proposition 187 provides the driving force in the fight against illegal immigration . After its passage , its opponents may flip-flop again ; but our resolve to stop illegal immigration and to deny benefits to illegal aliens will be evident . <p> PATRICK SKAIN <p> San Francisco <p> OVERWORKED <p> EDItor  --  The words " racism " and " racist " have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promiscuously have they been employed , in so many different situations , that they have long since ceased to have any precise meaning . Often , they are used simply as attack words  --  to intimidate , to close off discussion , to impugn the motives and good will of others  --  in much the same way as the words " communism " and " communist " were used in the early 1950s . <p> Unfortunately , name-calling of this sort seems to work most of the time . And because it works , it tends to become addictive and to make rational discourse on all matters touching on race nearly impossible . Is this what we really want ? <p> ROBERT H. KANTOR <p> Palo Alto <p> STRESS AND CONFUSION <p> Editor  --  A recent government study reported ( October 15 ) that our exhausted working women are overworked , underpaid and stressed out . The same study also reported that 79 percent of the same women either liked or loved their jobs . <p> I believe the study needs further study . <p> GENE LEDBETTER <p> Oakland <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting in favor of Proposition 186 , the health care takeover by the state of California , they need look no further than your article on the imminent collapse of state-run health care in Britain ( October 13 ) . <p> After more than 30 years of experience in running socialized medicine , the British government is still unsuccessful , despite a budget of $ 70 billion and a staff of one million employees . <p> Medical treatment has become a political football . Those who can afford it go outside the system for care . Does anyone really think that California politicians will perform any better ? <p> JOSEPH W. HAYDEN <p> San Francisco <p> THE COST OF BART <p> Editor  --  Referring to BART fare increases , BART board member Nello Bianco ( Chronicle , October 4 ) stated , " There 's just no way around it . " I disagree . <p> On one hand , we have both AC Transit and BART with serious financial problems . On the other hand , we have horrible East Bay traffic congestion and pollution caused mostly by automobiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a solution that will solve more than one problem at one time : Raise the Bay Bridge toll from $ 1 to $ 3 during peak times ( 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. ) and give 75 percent of the additional revenue to BART and AC Transit so that they will not raise fares . <p> It does n't take an economist to figure out that raising the bridge toll will decrease the number of single drivers on the bridge and increase the use of car pools and public transportation . But if the Board raises the BART fare , the number of riders on BART and AC Transit will drop , and the use of cars increase . In short , a bad situation will get much worse . <p> It 's time for East Bay lawmakers and transportation officials to find a solution that will increase quality of life for the entire Bay Area . Perhaps Quentin Kopp can facilitate a process that gives commuters a monetary reason for taking public transportation ! <p> MARK J.

" They know that Columbus had never heard of Santa Cruz either . <p> When Columbus landed , he found the residents all camped out in tents in a 3,000-mile wide national park , just as their ancestors had been since they ate the last mammoth . <p> Since then , a civilization has developed that has set foot on the moon , taken close-up photos of the most remote planets and peered through telescopes at the fringes of the universe . <p> But Santa Cruz wants to return to national park myopia . Well , they are n't all that important . After the Loma Prieta quake , they were n't heard from for over a week . We all assumed they had floated out to sea and went about our business . <p> But the University of California missed their local campus . So they financed an exploration flotilla to sail out of Berkeley harbor in search of the missing tuition . <p> When the Hoopla , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they found their history department seated on a curb near the Boardwalk , playing a mouth organ .
