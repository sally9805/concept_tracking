Is n't this just the cutest little universe you 've ever seen ? After centuries of technological striving , we finally got to Earth 's strange sere sibling Mars  --  and found rocks named Yogi , Scooby Doo and Barnacle Bill . Someone high up in NASA must have issued a firm directive : " Keep it cuddly , guys . We do n't want Mars to seem like , you know , outer space . " So when Sojourner bumped into one of the rocks , we were told Yogi gave her a " boo-boo , " and when she ( yes , the robot is a girl ) made a close approach to another one , we were informed that " Sojourner and Barnacle Bill are holding hands . " Kind of made you look at the vast red deserts of the two-mooned planet and want to go " Coochy-coochy-coo ! " Or , depending on your sensibilities , retire to the bathroom and retch . <P> But what can you expect from the culture that brought us Hercules ? In the myth Hercules was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his cradle , but with far less than the normal quotient of self-control , he kills his wife Megara and their three children in an inexplicable fit of rage and is condemned to perform his superhuman feats as a way of atonement . There 's a lesson here , maybe , about the disproportion between human ability  --  mental or muscular  --  and our capacity for moral reflection . But in the movie the tormented demigod becomes " Herc , " an ultra-buff teenage superstar who adores " Meg " and addresses the Great Goddess Hera as " Mom . " Maybe Disney did n't realize that Socrates was forced to drink hemlock for impieties far milder than that . What next ? Medea , who kills her own sons after Jason jilts her , as a perky homecoming queen who struggles with low self-esteem ? <P> We do it all the time , of course . Watch one of our shlockier televangelists , and you 'll be introduced to an affable deity eager to be enlisted as your personal genie . Yes , the Great Spinner of Galaxies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " love offering , " to relieve the itch of hemorrhoids and help you prevail in office intrigues ! At least the ancient Hebrews had the good sense to make Yahweh unnameable and unseeable except in the flames of a burning bush  --  a permanent Mystery . <P> When the sense of mystery is abolished , when the truly awesome gets replaced by the merely cute , we do n't stop wanting to feel the goose bumps of cosmic wonder . We just pack up our curiosity about the universe and trundle it off to a place like Roswell , N.M. , where a few unanswered questions are still allowed to live a furtive life . Though even there the wondrous quickly collapses into kitsch  --  T shirts and coffee mugs featuring darling little almond-eyed fetuses from space .
