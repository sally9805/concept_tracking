<p> Few issues are more sensitive than U.S. spying on friendly countries , except possibly CIA operations in this country . But both have been going on in Silicon Valley for years . <p> CIA agents have secretly enlisted high-ranking U.S. executives to help monitor key technology developments in Japan and other rival economic powers , businessmen who cooperated with the spy agency have told The Chronicle . And the incidents came long before the current debate in Washington over an expanded role for the agency in economic intelligence-gathering . <p> Sources said CIA agents approach chief executives or other officials at Bay Area high-tech companies who have inside knowledge of Japanese companies ' efforts in semiconductors , computers and other technologies . Some agree to share confidential information . <p> In one dramatic example , a prominent entrepreneur says he spied on his employer , a major Japanese electronics company , in the early 1980s while holding a high-ranking job at the company 's Silicon Valley unit . For several years he passed sensitive company documents concerning high-speed microchips and other plans to a CIA agent who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This guy would call me from the lobby with a pseudonym , and I would go out and give him a packet , " the executive said . <p> Another source , who says he passes the agency information about technology development in Japan and China , believes that the CIA is stepping up such efforts amid evidence that foreign intelligence agencies conduct spying operations against U.S. companies . <p> " I 'd bet my last nickel on it , " the executive said . " Everybody is doing it to us and we 're getting smart and doing it too . " <p> The executives ' stories provide a glimpse into a small corner of the CIA 's domestic operations , which are usually overshadowed by actions abroad . They come to light at a time of unusual ferment in the U.S. intelligence community . <p> A radical proposal from the chairmen of Congress ' intelligence committees would cut the CIA in half and create a new czar over several restructured agencies . CIA Director Robert Gates is expected to weigh in with his own reform plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . U.S. intelligence agencies since World War II have been obsessed with the Soviet military threat . Although the splintering of the U.S.S.R. actually could complicate the CIA 's job , policy makers are rushing forward with plans to improve efficiency and cut the $ 30 billion intelligence budget . <p> Technology also has transformed the agency 's agenda . Integrated circuits , which gave Silicon Valley its name , are essential to the type of smart weaponry that bludgeoned Iraq . To monitor compliance with an arms-control agreement , a CIA analyst might use satellite photos , high-tech microscopes , desktop workstations and supercomputers  --  all made possible by the ubiquitous microchip . <p> Japan 's lead in several critical technology areas , including some semiconductors and computer displays , make its companies an obvious target as the CIA tries to keep U.S. leaders informed of key events . <p> " We assess developments in specific technology areas , from semiconductors to advanced materials , " said a spokesman at CIA headquarters in Langley , Va . <p> The CIA does not comment on specific operations involving friendly countries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant " moles " in U.S. high technology companies . If the agency does target foreign companies in some circumstances , those complaints may seem hypocritical . <p> But there are key distinctions . Based on the accounts of Silicon Valley executives , CIA activities there have generally focused on developments that affect national security and the world economy . Other intelligence services allegedly work to help their countries ' industries or particular companies . <p> SHARING ISSUE <p> Although some policy makers think the CIA should share foreign company secrets with U.S. competitors , there is little evidence it has . " We are not in the business of industrial espionage , nor will we be , " the CIA spokesman said flatly . <p> CIA officials also do n't discuss domestic operations . It wo n't even disclose the location of its long-time San Francisco office , nor any of the others believed to operate in 37 U.S. cities . One former agent said one CIA office is in the Presidio , though other sources say the agency rents downtown office space in the guise of bogus companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number are answered with a recorded message , or sometimes only a beep to prompt callers to leave a message . That office did n't return calls ; at another unpublished number , an agent who has interviewed Silicon Valley executives declined comment . <p> One CIA unit , recently called the national collection division , interviews travelers returning from countries of interest to the agency and other people knowledgeable about foreign affairs . Another domestic unit , the foreign resources division , carries out more covert intelligence-gathering against foreign targets in this country , according to Jeffrey Richelson , an author of several books on U.S. spy agencies . <p> In Silicon Valley , CIA contacts apparently range from chief executives to market researchers . " There are businessmen who volunteer information to the U.S. government , " the CIA spokesman said . " We are happy to listen . " <p> EXECUTIVES ' STORIES <p> All of the Silicon Valley executives who spoke about their involvement with the CIA insisted on anonymity . They are identified here by fictitious first names . <p> Henry , the first executive quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high-frequency chips his Japanese employer was developing might find their way into spy satellites , sonar systems and communications hardware in China and the former Soviet Union . <p> As a high-ranking executive , Henry frequently traveled to Japan and sat in on advanced planning sessions during which five-year technology plans were disclosed . " Copies were provided to the CIA , " he said . <p> His CIA contact was described as a conservative dresser in his early 30s . " This fellow you could not pick out of a crowd , " Henry said . " He certainly had a handle on what was going on in Japan . " <p> In this case and others , patriotism rather than money was the motivation for helping the agency . Martin , chief executive of another medium-sized high-technology company , put it this way : " I 'm a former Air Force officer . I still go to bed with the flag . " <p> Louis , who heads another small Silicon Valley company , said his first contact came when he traveled to Japan a few years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their first appointment in Tokyo was with a senior CIA agent ; they discussed issues such as Japan 's production and pricing of microchips , and the ways its Ministry of International Trade and Industry influences companies . Contacts with a CIA agent followed in Silicon Valley . <p> " He asked me to write down whenever I spoke to a Japanese company or their agents here , " Louis said . <p> The agent was particularly interested in developments concerning prices on certain memory and logic chips , Louis said . Such products have been the focus in recent years of allegations that Japan has " dumped " chips on the market at less than production cost . <p> Sources said a CIA approach often starts with a phone call , followed up with a face-to-face meeting at which agents ask an executive to call if he learns something that might interest the agency . In some cases , agents ' business cards disclose they work for the CIA ; sometimes the cards simply list a person 's name and phone number . <p> Louis reached an agent by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I remember six months later we had occasion to call him again , " Louis said . " He was gone . " <p> MARKET RESEARCH <p> Silicon Valley market research firms are another resource for the CIA . Daniel , a former analyst at Dataquest Inc. , said he traveled to CIA headquarters to meet with buyers of the San Jose firm 's research reports . <p> " They wanted a heads-up with regard to U.S. competitiveness vs. the rest of the world , " Daniel said . <p> Military technology is another key focus . Pentagon officials have expressed concerns about the growing U.S. reliance on Japan for electronic components used in weapon systems . During the Persian Gulf War , CIA agents asked at least one Silicon Valley chipmaker about Japanese competition in military sales . <p> " They were trying to gauge the penetration of the Japanese in the military market , " said Karl , a mid- level executive who has been contacted several times by CIA agents over the years . <p> A more traditional CIA concern is technology in the former Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has met with one CIA agent at least twice , said the agency feared that a piece of sophisticated chip production equipment may have been diverted from India to the Soviet Union . That did n't happen , it turned out . <p> Michael , who works for another San Jose market research firm , said his company occasionally tipped off the agency to other cases involving suspected transfers of sensitive technology to Soviet-bloc countries . <p> But he also suspects that the CIA or some other intelligence professionals have burglarized his firm 's offices to inspect confidential files and also may have tapped phones . <p> " There is nothing taken , but it 's obvious that all the files have been gone through , " Michael said . " You see phone wires lying outside the phone box that were n't there the night before . "
