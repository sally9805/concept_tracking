<p> AUSTIN  --  Ann Richards may look invincible for re-election in public opinion polls , but several potential Republican challengers say the governor has demonstrated a lack of leadership that could be her undoing next year . <p> Texas Rangers baseball team owner George W. Bush , state Rep. <p> Tom Craddick of Midland , former gubernatorial candidate Tom Luce and Houstonian Rob Mosbacher Jr . say they are considering seeking the GOP nomination to challenge Richards in 1994 . <p> Each admits Richards might be tough to beat in a personality contest . But all use such phrases as " " absence of leadership " when outlining game plans for Richards ' defeat . <p> They say Richards ' failings were most evident in voters ' overwhelming rejection on May 1 of Proposition 1 , the school finance plan that she supported . They also cite the election defeats of Railroad Commissioner Lena Guerrero and Sen.Bob Krueger , her two most high-profile political appointees . <p> Luce and Mosbacher are veterans of past statewide elections . <p> Luce finished third in the 1990 Republican gubernatorial primary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP nomination for lieutenant governor three years ago but pulled only 45 percent of the vote against Democrat Bob Bullock . <p> Bush and Craddick have never run for statewide office . But Bush was active in his father 's past two presidential campaigns , while Craddick has been in the Legislature since 1969 . <p> Dallas oilman T. Boone Pickens says he also may be interested in running for the Republican gubernatorial nomination next year  - -  if the natural gas market improves enough for him to leave his business . <p> " " We 've been helped in the last six months , but not to the point where I can turn loose and run for governor , " Pickens said . <p> But Pickens said he believes 1994 would be his last opportunity to run . <p> " " If I 'm going to do it , I 've got to do it this time . I 'm 65 years old now , " he said . <p> " " I feel like I have good name I.D. , so it allows me to maybe wait longer than somebody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd have to do it by late fall . " <p> The other four Republicans say they will make earlier decisions . Bush and Mosbacher said they will decide whether to run by October , while Craddick and Luce give themselves until the end of this summer . The party primary elections are in March . <p> " " Anybody who is going to run will understand they need time to go out and build a coalition to run , " said Luce . " " I did n't announce until September in 1990 , and I can tell you it 's too late . " As a past candidate for governor , Luce , 52 , might be expected to have a leg up on the others . And he readily admits to having criss-crossed the state for the past two months giving speeches and making contacts . <p> But some Republicans may not forgive Luce for having served as one of Ross Perot 's top lieutenants in the Dallas billionaire 's presidential campaign , before Perot briefly dropped out of the race . <p> Luce , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried to make peace with President Bush before Perot re-entered the race , and he did not help Perot when he revived his candidacy in the fall . <p> He says the Perot association will not hurt him . <p> " " I 've talked to Republicans all over the state . I think they understood my longtime friendship with Ross Perot , " Luce said . " " I also think Republicans know that to win the governor 's race we need to reach out to Perot voters , independents and Republicans . " <p> Luce said next year 's Republican campaign against Richards should avoid becoming a clash of personalities and instead focus on issues such as " " leadership and education . " <p> " " What they ( voters ) have said all along is we 've got to fix the schools and then fund them . There 's been no leadership to do that , " he said . <p> Mosbacher , 42 , said Richards is potentially vulnerable on the issues of education , criminal justice and enhancing the state 's economy . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job at dodging bullets for the complete absence of leadership she 's provided in Austin , " he said . <p> " " I do n't think there is a singular event that today people identify as her responsibility . " <p> Mosbacher said Republicans should focus on voters ' pocketbooks and whether Richards can improve the economy . <p> " " The top issue has to be : Does the governor have a clue as to how to kick this state 's economic growth into overdrive ? " Mosbacher said . <p> " " She does n't have a clue as to how to fix it . She 's just a caretaker  --  " schmooze and feel good . ' " <p> Bush , 47 , said he is undaunted by Richards ' current popularity . <p> " " I understand how approval ratings work , " said Bush , who last year saw his father 's popularity plummet during the presidential campaign . <p> Bush noted that Richards ' approval rating has dropped from 73 percent to 63 percent in the past year in Dallas Morning News polls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " " Ann has n't been defined very much . She 's gotten a free ride . I have n't read too many editorials on her failure to lead on the education issue . She 's kind of ducked . So it may require a campaign to define her , " Bush said . <p> Richards , he said , needs to be pushed to take firm positions on improving education , limiting the growth of government and reforming the criminal justice system . He said she also should be forced to take responsibility for her appointments . <p> " " The defeat of Lena Guerrero and Bob Krueger , the two most visible appointments of a sitting governor , at a very minimum will send a psychological signal that this is a good year up and down the ticket , " Bush said . <p> Craddick , 49 , acknowledged that any Republican is going to find a race against Richards difficult . <p> " " She 's going to be tough to beat , " he said . " " But I do n't think she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taking any positions on the issues . " <p> Craddick criticized Richards for going on statewide television after the defeat of Proposition 1 to urge voters to support the Legislature on public school finance without herself stating support for a specific plan . <p> Although few statewide officeholders spring from West Texas , Craddick , who is from Midland , said he does not believe his regional background poses a problem for him . He said polls he has commissioned show he is well-known among Republicans in Dallas , Houston and San Antonio . <p> While the Republicans are lining up to take their shots at the governor , Democrats say that Richards is a savvy campaigner who boasts a solid record of accomplishment on which to run . <p> They point to the fact that the state has avoided a major general tax increase for time in a decade during her administration , while government has been overhauled to consolidate several agencies and create new savings . <p> They also note that lawmakers ultimately passed a school finance bill that averted closure of public schools this year .
