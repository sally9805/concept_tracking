" Here , we reveal your thoughts on your diet , body image , work sleep , exercise , emotions , even your spirit  --  the true elements of fitness . // Every gym has a rat . You know , that girl who 's always there , lifting , stepping , Spinning . She never misses a day , shows up in nearly every class , has n't met a machine she ca n't master . You see her rippling muscles and think , boy , is she fit . Is she really ? It 's tempting to gauge fitness by measuring the size of your biceps or mileage on a stationary cycle . Yes , fit people are powerful and agile . But a truly fit person makes it a priority to eat well , explore her spiritual side , find satisfaction in her work , have a positive body image and be emotionally content . And when the day is done , she knows the importance of giving her body ample time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of experts and women just like you about each of the seven elements of fitness and why they are significant And then we asked them how they - and you - cm bring these elements into our lives . Here are their thoughts . ELEMENT 1 Why It Matters : You know how you feel after a really great workout-strong and renewed and bursting with energy ? Well , in addition to keeping your body strong and flexible , exercise does wonders for your mind . It goes hand in hand with higher self-esteem , gives you the satisfaction of striving for and attaining your goals , helps keep the blues at bay . For your fitness , the American College of Sports Medicine recommends 20-60 minutes of aerobic activity , three to five days a week ( with a target heart rate of 55-90 percent your maximum ) along with total body resistance training and flexibility training two or three days a week . For your health , experts recommend 30 minutes of physical activity daily . ELEMENT 2 Why It Matters : It 's not just about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the nutrients that are-or aren't-in the foods you eat that really matter . As we learn more about how foods protect us from disease , eating well is more significant than ever . " The very foods that most nourish us - whole grains , legumes , and fresh fruits and vegetables  --  also reduce our risk of disease , " says Elizabeth Somer , M.A. , R.D. , author of Age-Proof Your Body : Your Complete Guide To Lifelong Vitality ( William Morrow and Co. , 1998 ) . " But they 're the very foods we 're not getting enough of . " your workout WE ASKED : Why do you work out ? Julie DeTraglia , 28 , television market researcher in New York City : " I feel better . To be honest , I 'm not the world 's most consistent exerciser . I 've gone months without doing anything . But every summer I run a 15k road race in Utica N.Y. , my hometown , and that gives me a goal and helps me motivate myself to work out . " How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airline pilot in Milwaukee : " For a while I was in a different hotel every other night , so I used the hotel pool for exercise , I went for walks in all the different cities , and I did calisthenics and sit-ups in my hotel room . For a while I was even doing kickboxing moves there ! " What 's your biggest exercise frustration ? Angela Ford , 35 , property manager and mother of 10-year-old son in Chicago : " Definitely , it 's getting to the gym . So I try to schedule it in , and write it down in my Franklin planner . That helps me because I look at my planner book three or four times a day . " OUR EXPERTS ADVISE : * If you do n't have time for a traditional workout each day , break down your workouts into three or four smaller chunks of 10 minutes each . And you can do different things in each of the chunks : Housework , gardening and washing the car all count , too . * If results come slowly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like - focus on the real reason you exercise , says Ellen McGrath , Ph.D. , psychologist and mental fitness director at La Palestra Center for Preventative Medicine in New York City . " You 're doing it to be healthier and stronger , not to look like a magazine cover model . " * Make fitness goals that are small and doable  --  steps that you can achieve each day . For example , make your goal " I will exercise every day for 30 minutes " rather than " I will get in shape before bathing-suit season , " says Ann Kearney-Cooke , Ph.D. , director of the Cincinnati Psychotherapy Institute . Photograph // * Set out to accomplish something : Run a 1 Ok , learn to snowboard , even learn to surf . your diet WE ASKED : Are you happy with what you eat ? Kate Willever , 24 , deputy sheriff in Greensboro , N.C. : " In college , I was a compulsive exerciser and I ate very little . It was a competition with my roommates who could be skinniest . Now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work - sometimes days , sometimes nights - it 's easy to eat candy or doughnuts . Now I pack a lunch  --  bagels , fruit , yogurt - and eat through the night as if it were day . " How do you work good nutrition into your life ? Emily Reid Kehe , 22 , graphic designer in Boston : " I try to cook my own meals . When you have control over what you are eating and not just ordering from a menu , then you can make better decisions . " OUR EXPERTS ADVISE : * Drink enough water , especially if you exercise a lot . " You lose about 10 cups a day just from normal activities , " says Diane Quagliani , R.D. , a dietitian in Chicago and a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association . To replenish , drink at least eight cups a day - the rest can come from the foods you eat - more on hot or physically active days . * If you 're counting calories , avoid calorie-rich sports drinks , unless you 're exercising really hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 60 minutes , plain old water is just fine , " Quagliani says . After more than 60 minutes of intense exercise , however , you need to replenish carbohydrates and sodium , and sports drinks are perfect for that . * Keep a fruit bowl by the front door and grab an apple , banana or other easy-to-eat fruit whenever you leave the house . " Fruits and vegetables can be just as quick to grab as foods that do n't give you much good nutrition , " Quagliani says . ELEMENT 3 Why It Matters : Photograph // Many of us spend so much time caring for our bodies that we forget to nurture our spirits . That 's a mistake because the balance spirituality provides has both physical and mental health benefits . " The greater a person 's commitment , the fewer his or her psychological symptoms , the better his or her general health , the lower the blood pressure , the longer the survival , " says Herbert Benson , M.D. , a Harvard researcher , founder of the Mind/Body Medical Institute in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , during which the body escapes from the health-sapping stresses of everyday ! life and enters into a relaxed state . How you get in touch with your own spirit varies by individual , Some people find spirituality through the rites and rituals of organized religion ; others discover it within themselves or in nature . ELEMENT 4 Why It Matters : Most people need eight hours a night . If that sounds like a lot , you 're either among the minority who need less , or , more likely , you 're chronically depriving yourself . " Most people just do n't ge adequate sleep , " says Jed Black , M.D. , director of the Stanford Sleep Disorders Clinic in Palo Alto , Calif . Chronic sleep deprivation can undermine your health in a variety of ways . It slows reaction time , affects sports performance , weakens the immune system and decreases learning ability . It also leads to irritability , depression and an inability to handle stress . your sleep WE ASKED : Do you get enough sleep ? Alicia Battle , 40 , sales manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out at 6 a.m. , which means I have to be up and out of bed by 5:30 at the latest . When I do n't go to sleep by 9 , I feel sluggish and unmotivated . " Do you sacrifice sleep for exercise ? D'Arcy Thomson , 35 , paralegal in Boston : " I will always choose workouts over sleep , which usually takes a back seat to both working out and my social life . " Laura Rose , 37 , health economist with The World Bank in Washington , D.C. : " I never blow off my rowing practice or other workouts because of lack of sleep . I 'll feel better if I work out , even if I 'm tired . What suffers , though , is my work later in the day . If I do n't sleep enough I simply fall asleep at my desk . " OUR EXPERTS ADVISE : * Exercise is important , but sleep is even more important , says Jonathan Schwartz , M.D. , medical director of the Integris Sleep Disorders Center of Oklahoma in Oklahoma City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a while is okay , but if you do it on a regular basis , your performance as well as your overall health may suffer . * If you 're not sure how many hours of sleep you need each night , do n't set the alarm clock for a few days in a row and see how long you sleep . " Your body knows how much sleep it needs , " Schwartz says . ( continued on page 141 ) ELEMENT 5 your emotions Why They Matter : When you 're in a bad mood , your whole world seems unbalanced . Sure , you can reach for a pill , a cocktail or even food , but if your moodiness is not severe , you 're better off chasing the blues away by building your emotional fitness . " If you ignore mental fitness , you accomplish significantly less , " says Ellen McGrath , Ph.D . " You need to build up mental muscle just like you 'd build up your biceps . " WE ASKED : Do you handle your emotions well ? Susan Shea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ages 7 and 4 , in Oak Park , Ill. : " I do , but who does n't go ballistic once in a while ? What are my triggers ? Running late ( I hate being late ) , my children running around screaming while I 'm trying to watch " Antiques Roadshow , " the program I wait all week for and the only one I watch . " Sarah Wright , 29 , journalism grad student in Columbia , Mo. : " I get cranky when I work too much . But exercise is a real soother . Sometimes I think this is the worst day , and then I go running and I come home wondering , Why all the fuss ? " ' Are you happy ? What do you do to make yourself happier ? Angela Ford : " Yeah , I am . I 've committed myself to being happy . Nobody 's going to do it for you , but do n't think that I did n't used to sit around and wait for someone to . When I feel blue I go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , play my favorite songs , drink some wine , light some candles . I do the whole thing until I 'm through it , or until " Frasier " comes on . I say I 'm going to be depressed right up until my TV shows come on . I 'm not missing my shows , especially if they 're not reruns . " Lorrie Cunneen : " Generally , yes . Even when I come in from my redeye flight , the people in the airline operations room say , You 're always smiling . " ' When I 'm down , sometimes I turn to chocolate , but other times long walks really help . I think things through , and when I come back , I have a better frame of mind . " How do you deal with the stress in your life ? Wright : " I tell myself to lighten up , quit being so petty , quit thinking this is a big deal . Lots of times I clean my purse when I 'm stuck in traffic and not moving or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go outside , take a deep breath , and look at the sky . I know this sounds New Age ' but it works . As for the kids running around , I try to picture the day when my children are grown and I would pay anything to have them be young and running around in my house again . " OUR EXPERTS ADVISE : * " Exercise is an essential mood manager , " says McGrath . " It 's critical for being able to manage stress and depression . Nothing 's a more consistent mood booster than regular exercise . Even a two-minute walk can help . " * Understand that building mental fitness is as tough as building muscle . " It takes time and effort and focus , " McGrath says . " It 's OK if you struggle with it . " * Have a list of positive , constructive activities that you can do to pull yourself out of a bad mood - go for a hike , learn a new sport , train for an event . " All of these types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kearney-Cooke says . " They 're not like the fleeting good feeling you get when you buy a new dress . " * Acknowledge your negative feelings . " Sometimes when we have negative feelings we drink too much or eat too much or spend a lot of money to get away from them , " says Kearney-Cooke . Let yourself feel them , she suggests . Then , try to come up with an action plan to uncover the source of negative feelings and to solve the underlying problems causing the negative feelings . ELEMENT 6 your body image Why It Matters : " The way women hate their bodies holds them back more than most anything else , " says McGrath . " It really hurts you to focus on the parts of your body you do n't like . " Here 's an example : You 're in front of a mirror in the gym , doing a biceps curl , and instead of putting your energy into lifting , you fixate on your upper-arm flab . Not only are you giving in to negative body images , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A positive body image , on the other hand , allows you to focus on the real purpose of exercise : to make your body strong and healthy . Plus , research shows that body image plays a critical role in women 's self-esteem , says Kearney-Cooke : " The body is the house you live in , and when you talk negatively about your body , you 're talking negatively about yourself , affecting your overall self-esteem . " WE ASKED : Do you accept your body as it is , or are you constantly trying to change it ? Kate Willever : " I 'm happy now . When I exercise regularly I 'm the happiest , and lately I 've been exercising three to five times a week . " Kim Garcia : " At 38 , I 've noticed some things that were n't the way they were when I was younger . I 've never had a weight problem , so it 's all relative , but for me they 're problem areas . But overall , my body image is pretty healthy . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body ? Carrie Cerullo , 24 , marketing analyst in Brighton , Mass. : " I love taking the time , whether it 's an hour or two hours , to focus on nothing but myself once a day - for a run or to sweat my way through a cardio-boxing class . Afterward I feel so accomplished and refreshed . I try to treat my body like a mutual fund , knowing I 'm only going to get returns on what I invest in it . " OUR EXPERTS ADVISE : * " Keep track each day of positive things that you do for your body , " says Kearney-Cooke . Include exercise , long walks , even a trip to the grocery store to stock up on fresh fruit , a bath , a massage , or whatever works . * At the gym , stay focused on yourself and your muscles , not your flab . " Instead of competing with Thong  --  Girl next to you , focus on the movement of the muscle and getting that movement as precise as you can , " McGrath says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which negative feedback stays in your mind and positive feedback falls through the holes . * Talk to yourself about what you like about your body - your strong legs , your full breasts . Think about the positive rather than the negative . ELEMENT 7 your work Why It Matters : Does your job ever remind you of that old episode of " I Love Lucy " in which Lucy and Ethel , hired to wrap chocolates at a candy factory , ca n't keep up with the chocolates flying by them on the conveyor belt ? If your job is that stressful , you could be jeopardizing your health . " Workplace stress is the No. 1 health problem for working adults , " says Barbara Bailey Reinhold , Ed.D. , author of Toxic Work : How to Overcome Stress , Overload , and Burnout and Revitalize Your Career ( Plume , 1997 ) and director of the Career Development Office at Smith College in Northhampton , Mass . " It contributes tremendously to cardiovascular problems , hormonal imbalances , immune system malfunction , depression and anxiety . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitzgerald , 36 , free-lance graphic designer in Brooklyn , N.Y. : " I had a very stressful staff position and never had time for a run , a swim , a bath . Free-lancing , I can make time for those things that make me happy . " How does work satisfaction affect your overall well-being ? Alicia Battle : " I used to have a job where I spent 10-12 hours a day . My health suffered and I gained 30 pounds . So I quit the job and got smart . Now I have a job that I can handle and that does n't handle me . " OUR EXPERTS ADVISE : * Decide to learn to like your job or find a job you 'll like . Find ways to exert control over your daily tasks , because , according to Reinhold , the people who feel most stressed by work are the ones who have the least control . Also , ask : Do you have a bad job or a bad attitude ? If it 's truly your job , talk to a career counselor. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , learn to live on less money and downsize your work commitment . " You 're not stuck ! " Reinhold says . " You can cut down to two-thirds time and do something else with the rest . Or you can do another job you 'd like better that does n't pay as well . " * Seek career advice : Web sites ( www.monster.com ) , books ( I Could Do Anything If I Only Knew What It Was by Barbara Sher and Barbara Smith , Delacorte Press , 1994 ) and college career offices ( which offer networking services to alumni ) . * Avoid " anesthetic spending " in which you self-medicate with credit cards . You 'll only chain youself tighter to your job . Author Affiliation Alice Lesch Kelly is a writer in West Newton , Mass. // <p>
