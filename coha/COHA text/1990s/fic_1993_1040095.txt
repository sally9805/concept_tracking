" The conversation would die again . From the rear would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man commanding the scene and climb up on the darkened porch to snuggle up to his uncle . Purposely , Mr. Archy would not notice him . " What a night that must have been " " It was a rough one , Mr. Archy " " A goddamn plantation full'a slaves , an ' you couldn'a find one of ' em .

" " All alone , Mr. Archy . " " All alone . An ' from a dead woman " " Yassuh " " Poor Charlotte , " Mr. Archy would always conclude . He would collect himself and climb back aboard the buckboard . And say quietly : " I loved her , Ben . "  | And Ben would be just as quiet : " I knows you did , Mr. Archy . " He would pause again , and then he 'd say , " I never loved Mildred . " To which Ben would reply , " I knows you didn ' , Mr. Archy . " Now he would clutch the reins . The heavy air of nostalgia would take its toll . " Ben , " he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what y ' all used to do for me ? " " I ' members , Mr. Archy . " " Do you think . . . ? " He would not lose the thought ; rather , he would sit there , searching the air . Prolonged moments , and he 'd ease back . " Do you think . . . Ben , do you think you could do just a little bit of it for me now ? Just a little bit , Ben just a little bit for the boss-man . " " Yessuh , Mr. Archy . " And from out of the darkness of the porch , the tired old brokenbacked black man would sing to the beat and conscience-stricken white man : " Go down , Mo'ses Way down in Egyp'lan ' ... . Tell of pharaoh To let My peeple go .... " And as this was sung softly , together the two minds would roll back to what someone had referred to as the good old days . The good old days of slavery , when his plantation stood as a symbol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sprinkled nicely with obedient , sunup-tosundown blacks toiling at the land . Those were the days when he confusingly ruled , when he could , in secret , love an insouciant black girl but would not permit the others to leave the boundaries of the plantation . They were the latter days too , when he would not allow them to go as far as tiny Red Springs in fear they would find out that slavery had , in fact , been over for four long years . He was not there at the start of slavery , but he was there on time . He was there , and , in his  | first few years after marriage , he ruled when the good and decent ? the linen-suited as well as the putrid and smelly  --  would drift in for a visit , and he would dispatch Ben on the mission of rounding up all the female slaves so that the visitors from " the big sidy " could be properly entertained . And if they did n't feel so disposed , he would trot out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed male slaves for the females so that the " big sidy " visitors could watch a show of unrestricted lewdness . And those were the days , too , when , prompted from God knows what , he would order the slaves to momentarily stop their back-breaking work and surround his porch with song . It did not have to be on a moonlit night : " Go down , Mo'ses , Way down in Egyp'lan ' ... . Tell of pharaoh To let My peeple go .... " " An ' I let ' em go , did n't I , Ben ? " " Yes , suh , Mr. Archy . " " If Mildred had been livin ' , it never would'a happen 'd , would it , Ben ? " " No , suh , Mr. Archy . " " She did n't like a damn thing I did , did she , Ben ? " " No , suh . Mr. Archy . " " Did you ever know anythin ' that woman waned , Ben ? " " Never know 'd , Mr. Archy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I. " He would wait , and then he would say , " I long for the old days . . . . But I did somethin ' good , did n't I Ben ? " " Yes , you did , Mr. Archy . " " I did somethin ' right . " " Real right , Mr. Archy. "  | " Ben  --  Ben  --  Ben , do you think  --  Ben , can you ? ? Ben , do you ? could you just just a lil ' bit ? " He did not have to finish the question . Again  --  low , and haunting : " Go down , Mo ' ses , Way down in Egyp'lan ' ... . Tell of pharaoh To let My peeple go .... " " An I let ' em go did n't I , Ben ? " " Yes , y'did , Mr. Archy , " Ben said quietly . " You let ' em go " " Night , Ben " " Night , Mr. Archy . " The boy snuggled in closer to his uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Boss man , " said the boy . But the man on the buckboard did not want to listen . He was gone . If they did n't eat , Ben and the boy would retire for the night . The full measure of darkness would swing down and clamp a special kind of silence on everything except the frogs , the crickets , and the mosquitoes . The rest of Red Springs , North Carolina , would sleep .  | Time pushed forth a modest but welcomed change on the plantation . Before the days of servitude were over , Mr. Archy had acquired a few additional slaves from a farmer in nearby Shannon who had drunk himself into bankruptcy . With the added help , Ben no longer had to go and nurse the fields on Sundays ; he did , however , have to spend a few hours at the main house , tidying up a few odds and ends , and covering areas overlooked by the house staff . But those chores were generally over well before noon , and Sundays , in the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocker and somnolently sifting through a batch of youthful questions . The boy , Moses , had not quite reached the age where he could tie things together , but it was at that time of life when the world was expanding and Ben was no longer able to avoid questions about Mr. Archy , and more important  --  to him , at least  --  he was no longer able to romp across the dusty battlefields and charge armies without question . Not that the boy doubted him , or that the stories were any less spirited or interesting , but it was a matter of youthful syllogistics that prompted him to ask more questions . " Un'ca Benny , " he asked one typically beautiful and lazy Sunday afternoon as he sat on the edge of the porch undoing a knot he had tied on the hind legs of a petrified frog . " Was Mr. Archy ever a gennel in th ' army ? " " Heavens , no , boy . Whatever made you think of somethin ' like that ? " " Cause he 's always tellin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' cause my position 's changed . " " If it hadn'a changed , could you tell him what to do ? " " I could . " " Sho ' wish you was a gentler And with that , the frog croaked once and lightly hopped away . The frog , though , pointed to one of the little oddities of Sundays . Ben did not mind the boy playing with frogs or worms or anything else he normally entertained himself with . But on the day of the sabbath he did n't want the rough stuff . No running or jumping or stories . It was , he contended , against the will of God . This was odd , because the boy had once asked him about New Hope Church and Ben had replied , rather tautly , " T'aint worth talkin ' ' bout . " The issue was closed . Ben 's attitude toward the church no doubt stemmed from the attitude the church members had toward him , which dated a long way back . Hints of freedom were in the air back then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in those incredible , those wild and hectic days , laced with whooping and shouting and singing and merriment that seemed like they would never end , the blacks did not hesitate to praise God to the highest . Every single night , New Hope Baptist Church bristled with activity . But Sunday was the day of all days . No self-respecting black would let high noon shine upon him outside the door of New Hope Baptist . The aged , the weak , the crippled , would hobble into New Hope , and in most cases , be more than adequately prepared to spend the day listening to  --  and for  --  the word of God . They did not have nor could they read hymnals or Bibles , but Reverend Terrell , fired as no Baptist preacher in the whole South , would unleash a sermon that would have the congregation shouting beyond all measure . Monday morning would roll around and all the working " how-do-u-do 's " would be reverently flavored with such comments as : " Sho ' was a good Sunda ' service we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd . " " Freedom day is a-comin ' . " " Glory ! "  | " I feels it . I feels it ! Good God a'mighty , I feels it ! " There was one person , however , who was not renewed , and did not " feel it " at all : Ben . The blacks had tossed him out of favor long before thoughts of obtaining freedom , at that time charging him with such diverse and unseemly activities as snooping , snitching , withholding information , and for being overly subservient to Mr. Archy . The conflict gained impetus one Sunday about a year before freedom was granted . Out of the spirit of good fellowship , a missionary group extended a " conditional " invitation to Mr. Archy 's main man to attend a brief evening service . Main-man Ben waited almost a year before honoring the invitation , but he did it on a Sunday morning . New Hope was not a beautiful church . Owing to a lack of proper building materials and workmanship , it leaned toward the distressed side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen from the main road , it was an " eyesore . " Worse , in their words , it was an " escape hatch that sits plumb in the middle of Archy 's place betwixt the road and Red Springs right where we ca n't see what 's going on " The observation was not entirely correct . The church , sitting not on Mr. Archy 's property or even Red Springs 's land , for that matter , was built on the " no-man 's " section just forward of a swamp , which discouraged escape , and the church 's main function , which it did with commendable struggle , was to serve as a place of worship . It was not designed for anything else . Again , like any slave-constructed church , New Hope was a church of hope and spirit , and it rightly merited the best Sunday finery ? which , essentially did not differ from the weekday finery of overalls and torn print dresses . But at least the attempt was made to wash them in a kettle of soap made from lye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolled around . Ben 's grunt of the year before finally led to a visit . When he slowwalked up to the door that sweaty and humid Sunday morning , he was dressed  --  and smelling  --  no better than he would had he scheduled a visit to the nearest pigsty . Sweet Elsie Pratt was heard to say that there was enough dirt under his fingernails to grow groceries . Whether the observation was true or not had never been established . It was known , however , that the moment he walked through the door ,  | the politely nosy and surreptitious head-turnings normally associated with congregations were completely abandoned . Necks strained and eyes rolled as though Satan himself had breezed in . And just about like Satan would have done , Ben nonchalantly strolled on past the eyes , necks , and intended-to-be-heard " 00000hs , " and plopped down on the deacon 's bench , tossed a thick wad of tobacco in his mouth , and sat uninvolved throughout the ceremony . When it was over , still like Satan , they politely but firmly escorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , needless to say , never returned to New Hope . So against the church did Ben become that one day , while visiting the store , McMillan had asked him when and where the slaves held their meetings . Ben told him everything he wanted to know . It would prove costly . Ben would have remained aloof and in relative isolation , spending his time on the fields or in his shack or somewhere around the plantation had it not been for Sweet Elsie Pratt . Sweet Elsie , as she chose to be called , was a two-fisted , nonprized ex-slave from " the big sidy " of Lumberton , North Carolina , population : 985 . She was proud , heavy-hipped , and an avid snuff-dipper . After escaping ( with secret blessings from her former slavemasters ) , Sweet Elsie arrived in Red Springs after having fallen woefully short of her original destination of New York City , some five hundred and eight miles away . But not being one to let such an insignificant thing as misdirection upset her , and thankful because the swamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make the best of outer Red Springs and set about the most improbable task of blending in with the rest of the slaves at Mr. Archy 's plantation while importantly and quite incorrectly assuming there was a price on her head . It would have been somewhat disturbing for Elsie to have learned that all three of her masters had , in fact , planned her escape for months and were quite displeased she was slow in taking the bait . In what had been an extraordinarily short period of time though , and while strategically remaining out of Mr. Archy 's view , Sweet Elsie managed to install herself leader of the tiny-town slaves , and some say that had it not been for her leadership , Mr. Archy never would have released them , which , of course , lends itself to serious  | doubt . While Elsie might have been responsible for prodding the slaves to think about freedom , it was not through her initiative , or the slaves , for that matter , who had caused Mr. Archy to free them . But to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a knowledge of something the McBride slaves had no knowledge of : freedom . Bold for the times , she was primarily responsible for the many uneasy " freedom " meetings that were held in New Hope , and on the fields she brought to the plantation spirit and color . In a lot of ways , Sweet Elsie Pratt was a born leader . She had a strong voice and a face that glistened , and when not troubled , could have been described as jolly and infectious . But the face could not benefit from the attributes because most of the time it was kneaded in agitation and aggravation . As a speaker she was a stem-winder . No one could pull her off stage . At the meetings in church , and always speaking from the pulpit and in a voice soaking in condemnation , she would always start with the question : do you know what freedom is ? No matter how many times she asked the question there would always be a lone , thin voice , more than likely coming from the church 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the word " no'am , " and you could almost see it ducking back outside as it answered . But the no'am , meaning No Ma'am , would start it . Elsie would rear back from the pulpit , and v0000m . Eight minutes of salty impieties would get her warmed up , and then she would be just about ready to launch into a subject that , at about the time she was through , would have her breathing as though coronary arrest was imminent . The subject would be the white man . Sweet Elsie Pratt did not like the white man . Church etiquette aside , she would cuss him and all that was his . She would cuss him , his mother , his father , go easy on the children , come back and cuss his relatives , his possessions , and anything he might own in the future . She would fall back and cuss any and all of his ancestors , foreign and domestic . There was not a thing about the white man or the white man 's family tree that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried away with her dislike of the white man that Reverend Terrell , New Hope 's pastor , knowing better than to make the approach on his own , would signal the deacons to sit her down . Getting Sweet Elsie Pratt to sit  | down was not an easy assignment . Very often the deacons , having made the approach with fear and head-hanging dismay , would find themselves in the same category as the white man , and she would take a swing and send the pastor and the deacons scrambling . One day she took a swing , she missed , picked up the pulpit and sent everybody running . When she finished , there was n't anything left in church but the sound of the tambourine . And that was coming from outside . It was in the path of the running congregation . It was said that it was because of Sweet Elsie that the church had come under several attacks by the Red Springers . More than likely it was true , but Elsie could n't be stopped . She brazenly decided to hold the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the direct center of Mr. Archy 's fields . Naturally the meetings were supposed to be top-secret and therefore did not include Ben . He and Mr. Archy would have had to have been deaf not to have heard her , because even out there Elsie had a voice that rang like a cannon . When she laughed , as she sometimes did , or stressed a point , or reached back for an apt description of the white man , she sounded like a cannon exploding . The biggest boom , however , was reserved for when she talked about Ben and Mr. Archy , so the trick as learned in church , was to pump her with as many niceties as possible during the course of the meetings , and at all costs , avoid mentioning Ben and Mr. Archy and the white man . For some reason during that last year , it seemed that Sweet Elsie had mellowed , because she actually spoke to Ben in a civil tongue once . In fact , she was the one who had extended the original invitation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended the original arm in escorting him out of church that muggy Sunday after-noon ) . Elsie probably would have ignored Ben altogether had it not been for a rumor that popped up sometime later concerning Mr. Archy having fathered a child by a cute , far-too-young , and much-too-frisky housekeeper who had rejected her slave lover in favor of the plantation owner . Worse , Ben was keeping the child because the young mother had died during childbirth . Sweet Elsie thought such a thing too preposterous to be believed and probably would have passed on it had it been anyone else other  | than Mr. Archy . Since it was him , and knowing that the man could n't be trusted , she decided to investigate  --  as any good busybody would have done . Taking the mile trip and catching Ben in the fields one particularly hot and dry afternoon , Elsie got one of the more sudden shocks of life when she learned that not only was there truth to the rumor , but that the girl had died during childbirth , and Ben was there when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred in mind ) , Ben tried to give a halfhearted explanation . Elsie would n't have any of it . She screamed , cursed , and called him every name in the book . She rolled up her sleeves , threw up her fists , and dared him to defend himself . He could n't . " Where 's th ' child ? ! " " He wit ' me , Elsie ! " " Wit ' who ! I do n't see no baby ' round here ! " " He at th ' house . " " What house ? ! " " My house . " " Your house ? ! " " S'where he is . He can take care'a hisself . " The response was so outrageous she could no longer speak . Instead , she grabbed Ben and almost threw him on the wagon . All she could think about was seeing a tiny , crib-size infant wrapped in swaddling clothing and crying out for maternal care . When the wagon pulled into the yard , the boy had already completed a jaunt through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creek and was now back , napping comfortably on the porch . Elsie , upon seeing the stretched out figure , screamed : " Lan ' sakes alive , boy , where you come from ? ! " Almost like one would greet thunder , the boy rolled over and opened his eyes , focused , and scrambled to his feet . " Hi'ya , Un'ca Benny , " he said , flashing a what-you-doin ' - in- so- early grin , and then extending a courteous who's-you nod to the fat visitor . Elsie was flabbergasted . " S'that him , Ben ? Is that him ? " " Yep , that 's him , " Ben said proudly . " H'it just ca n't be , " said Elsie . " You shore that 's him ? "  | " Umhum , " said Ben . " Where you from , boy ? " Elsie asked . " The cav'ry . " " Th ' who ? " Elsie asked , not having the slightest idea who or what the cavalry was . " Th ' cav'ry in th ' army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' how long is you gon na be with us ? " Elsie asked . " ' Til th ' nex ' war . " It was love at first sight . She absolutely adored him , and her questions were endless . What'cha name ? How 'd you get'cha name ? How old is you ? Where y'been hidin ' ? Is Ben been good t'you ? How 's your eatin ' ? Been t'church ? Wha'cha do all day ? Is Mr. Archy been by t'see you ? You wan na go home with me ? and on and on . She concluded that he was a " smart , fella , " hugged and kissed him royally , and vowed that she would always be there for him . And he was smitten with her . Sweet Elsie had hugged him , kissed him , and asked him questions . No one had ever done that before . From Sweet Elsie 's point of view , it was fortunate that he was a " smart lil ' fella . " Had he not been , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Archy would have been in trouble . On the way in from the fields , Sweet Elsie had made up her mind to take the child . Unknown to her , such an act could have been accomplished only over Ben 's dead body , and because he stood in the fields in seeming helplessness did not mean that under serious threat of losing the boy he would n't have challenged death itself . The point being that his attitude in the field was just another oddity in the long line of inextricable things about Ben . Happily no other problems arose that day and , ironically , what had started out on a note of utter hostility flowered into something special for all of them ; for as the day drew to a close , the fine , uncharted seeds of need had subtlely taken hold , and when Elsie left well after midnight , something wonderful nibbled at her  --  as it did Ben  --  and it was an altogether new and different feeling . It was not as bubbly or springy or bucolic or idyllic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm and cozy , something strong enough to ward off the  | loneliness of the long evenings and the pitiful process of aging . That 's what it was ; something for the old and the growing old . Like the moon that followed her and slid behind dirt-poor old New Hope and silhouetted her as she stopped the wagon to go inside , she knew the beauty of what she felt that day , and sealed by a tingling evening , would last . After being on her knees and giving thanks to a good and giving God , she would hurry to the slave quarters and get her things . She did not have much , but now Sweet Elsie Pratt had a home to go to . Soon , very soon , for the first time in her life , she would know a man , and she would have a man ; they would have each other . In the morning when she awakened , they would have a son . If all went well in the coming years , perhaps the old church could stand one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three of them . It would be good for family . All did not go well in the coming years . All did not go well those hours after midnight . Like the church , Sweet Elsie Pratt died at the hands of a wagonload of Red Springers . It was their third attack on the little church where the big lady had stood and spoke for freedom . The flames were short and blustery .  | While Red Springs slept in obscurity and remained oblivious of everything but the change of seasons , the days passed without much happening at the plantation . Ben did not linger on the memory of Sweet Elsie , and only once or twice did he recall that night . When he ( lid , it was with the shallowness and fleetingness of unformed vapor . Ile had accepted it all for what it was , as something that had happened and , like the vicissitudinous winds of life , things come ; things go . To question life further would be fruitless . If Elsie had remained , it would have been different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something even deeper than he had imagined  --  something for him ; something for her . But it did not happen .

And so , with the boy at his side , Ben would spend his evenings sitting on the porch , inwardly alone , absently sifting through a batch of questions and quietly rocking with an uncluttered mind . Like the lowing of a clock , the former plantation master had been coming into the yard later and later . That was just fine with Ben . More and more Mr. Archy 's days were weighted with loneliness . His nights , unfittingly set up by the slow crawl of uneventful evenings , grew in length and had begun to wrestle with a troubled mind . I le would never admit it , but it would have helped if the boy would have been at the creek when day was dying  --  when , seemingly , activity was needed most . But lately , certainly since Sweet Elsie Pratt , the hoy was seldom there , preferring to spend his time waiting for his uncle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring down the shades of night .  | There was no question about it , the boy missed Sweet Elsie Pratt . He often asked when she was coming back , and he wondered , too , if she had ever been inside the big house . He had n't . Unlike before , though , maybe the boy would 've been welcomed in the house because Mr. Archy needed something to break the monotony of everyday living . There was simply nothing to do . Nothing to say to anyone . The nothingness was getting worse . There was a time , too , when Mr. Archy actually asked himself , did he really want the place ; and then he looked as if he were dissatisfied with the answer his mind was leading him to . Coinciding with that , he had now fallen into the pattern of waiting late into the day , of mounting the buckboard , circling the entire plantation , coming back to the house , and slowly taking the route leading to Ben 's place . In the yard , he would- n't climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ; rather , he would stay aboard and consume minutes before saying anything . Dutifully , Ben would wait . Cautiously , the boy would try to remain inconspicuous behind Ben 's rocker . " Y'say t'morrow is town day , Ben ? " Ben had n't said anything . But he 'd lie : " Y'suh . We runnin ' pretty low . " " Ben . . . Ben . . " He 'd drop it and sit there with a wandering mind . Ben knew what he was going to ask . " Yassuh , Mr. Archy ? " " Ben . . . Ben . . . do y'think  --  Ben , you s'pose it 'd be all right if I went in ? " It was not all right , and Ben knew it . Red Springs and Archibald McBride were pure trouble , and why he persisted in going there was beyond the black one 's comprehension . On this subject , Ben would always try to avoid the answer . " Huh , Ben ? Y'think it 'll be all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archy did n't want one . " I s'pose it 'd be all right , " Mr. Archy would say . " You stay an ' tend to th ' fields . I 'll go " He lowered his eyes tiredly and fingered loosely on the reins as Ben rocked slowly . " Ai n't always been like this , huh , Ben ? " Ben could answer that one : " Nosuh , Mr. Archy. "  | From the buckboard , Mr. Archy looked away again . He then looked up on the darkened porch , and then , as the boy found courage enough to come from behind the rocker to straddle one of the two beams that held the porch in relative distance from the house , the plantation owner started again : " Do you die givin ' birth to somethin ' like that ? " It was , as usual , not so much of a question as it was a statement . " Y'better keep ' im out of my sight , Ben . I do n't care what you do with ' im just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben ? You got that ? " Ben got it , but Ben would n't respond . Nor would the boy . They had heard it before , and they would hear it again . But despite the harshness of content and tone , never once did it overly disturb the child . He did n't welcome it , but it did n't truly upset him . It could not be said that he had not understood , that protected by the coat of youth he was impervious to the barrage , it could not be said that he did not know at least something of this man 's ire . No , it could n't be said . What could be said , though , was that Sweet Elsie Pratt  --  sensible Elsie Pratt had  --  confirmed something in him that he did n't understand . The night she went away , she had talked about the hope of man , and the inevitable goodness of man . This was a time to remember . But even if he did not remember , even if he did not understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significance of what was being said , it was not that important . After all , the child knew something the man did n't know . Deep down inside , he liked him . " Night , Ben . " " Night , Mr. Archy. "  | The next day 's morning peeked out with a kind of sleepy-eyed lateness , hung for a while , then hoisted a slow but generous sun that found Ben at Mr. Archy 's place , readying the buckboard for the trip into town . A moment later , a disgruntled Mr. Archy came out adjusting a hat that corresponded with his crumpled white seersucker suit . He took only a fleeting glance at the headstones and , totally ignoring Ben , climbed aboard and stung the mare 's rear away . Ben looked after him for a long , unreadable moment and then mounted his wagon and headed back to the fields . The Red Springs store was precisely four and three quarter miles from the big house , and save for the midway point where , deep off the road , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been considered a calming trip , made all the more peaceful by endless stretches of wild but scented greenery . Normally it was Ben 's job to make the monthly , and sometimes bimonthly , supply trip because Mr. Archy had once vowed that the only way he would ever set foot in dried-up Red Springs again was as a stretched-out dead body . He made no mention of what was to be done in the event the body was not stretched out . The thought never troubled anyone . It was even less of a concern of Silas 's , as he and a few others sat on the stoop of McMillan 's store that day . With his feet lazily soaking in the pickle barrel , Silas happened to peer off in the direction of the approaching buckboard . For some  | reason , he did n't comment to the others and waited for man and horse to come within squinting distance . When they were closer , Silas two-toed a pickle from the bottom , grabbed it , popped it into his mouth , and leaned farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckboard . It was Archibald McBride 's , all right , and now even the others could hardly wait for the man on-board to close in on the stoop before uttering the appropriate greetings . " Well , well , well , " Silas started off , " look what th ' sun 's done brung out . A dead body . " The other men complemented the remark by chuckling lightly and registering a derisive " Mornin ' to ye , y'ole polecat . How y'be ? " Mr. Archy refused to look in their direction , climbed down from the buckboard , and quietly tied the mare to the hitching post . " Didn ' s'pect to ever see you back in th ' Springs , Mr. McBride . Somethin ' wrong at'cha place ? " Silas said , munching on the pickle while shifting a sly eye at the other men who urged him on . Silas nodded agreeably and waited . Then , just as Mr. Archy 's foot touched the first of the two steps leading to the stoop , Silas winked for the benefit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownin ' up to your lil ' blackberry . " He knew that remark would get him . And it did . Mr. Archy reddened with the intensity of a beet . He stopped short in his tracks , his jaws muscled in tightness . But he did n't turn . He simply held there , rigid . He took the second step and held again . Do n't , he said to himself . The shabby interior of the store never gave evidence of having enjoyed better days , and the musty atmosphere remained the same ? the same as when the youngster had started telling the story . It was the height of summer , but J. D. , Shep , and the newly added Tonic and Okra were perched around the unlit stove , engaged in idle chatter with three other old-growing codgers along with a strapping , slow-moving , and dim-witted character by the name of Cruddup , who , at thirty-eight , represented the youth of the group . Both Okra ,  | who had a head like a bullet , and Tonic , untrusted because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about twenty years older than Cruddup . McMillan was behind the counter , and the only other person in the store , and not exactly doing much for the female gender , was a weebosomed , fragile little lady with an angelic face and heavenly thoughts . She represented Red Springs 's churchgoing uppercrust . Sometime ago McMillan had once nailed her on a sack of flour in the back of the store and promoted the good act the next day by showing the stains to Silas , who in turn claimed the tiny spot as his own . " S'all for t'day , " she said sweetly , arming the sack of groceries . " Okay . " McMillan said , and respectfully waited for her to withdraw from the counter so that he could run over and confirm lust by poking Cruddup in the ribs . The eyes remained on the long-skirted and backside-starved rear as it completed the move from the counter to the door . Cruddup shot his imagination up to fanciful heights and wheezed to McMillan , " What 'd you say they looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hot damn ! " said Okra . In further exaggeration , McMillan pushed his arms out barrellike . Cruddup vibrated at the demonstration : " Hottttt dammmmmm ! " The salacious air came to an abrupt end . Just as she fully disappeared outside , tilting her birdlike nose in the air at Mr. Archy , in he came . There was a nudging silence . He said nothing , and went to the counter . There he waited . And waited . Finally he slammed a fist down . " McMillan , am I gon na get service , or are you gon na stand over there like the idiot you 're known to be ! " " You ai n't in no position to come in here an ' orderin ' people around , McBride ! " McMillan said . " It 's Mister McBride ! " Mr. Archy said . Shep grunted . ? Mister ' ? now , ai n't that th ' last word . " " Shep , when I 'm talkin ' to you , I 'll go back to hog callin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ' findin ' some'a them pigs you used t'sleep with , " Shep said .  | Mr. Archy shot for the stove poker . " I 'll kill you , y'bastard . " Cruddup , Okra , and Tonic sprung to their feet and grabbed him . " If you got any sense , Archy , you 'll get'cha can outta here . An ' stay out . I done told you that a long time ago ! " " You do n't tell me where I can go an ' where I ca n't . I built this town " J. D. leapt up : " You ai n't built a dawddang thing ! " " Not a damn thing ! " Echoed Silas from the door , still munching on the pickle , his feet still damp from the pickle brine . " Mac , don'cha let'em have a dang-blasted thing . Nuttin ' . " " Nuttin ' , " echoed the suspected half-breed . " An ' y'aint built this town ! You allus sayin ' it ! An ' you allus wrong ! Wha'cha did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' finest spot th ' Lord ever done number two on ! " Silas snorted , and then strutted around like a peacock , emulating Archy 's moves , as if he 'd been there that day . " Folks , " Silas said , " t'day is th ' day I 'm gon na free you . T'day is th ' day you gon na be'a thankin ' Archibald McBride for a long , long time . Well , you see how they thanked you . Y'see how they thanked Red Springs ' ? Ya dum ' bastid ! " He reloaded and refired . " They ai n't a nigger in sight ! Not one ! Exceptin ' that hunch'a yours . An ' he 's too dum ' an ' cripple to even know how to move on ! " The men agreed and , sure that the points were driven home , backed off a little  --  not much , just enough to permit a thorough soaking of the words . Silas continued to encircle the group . " Y'better leave while th ' leavin ' is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wants so 's he can get outta here . " " Why give im anythin ' ? " Cruddup said without releasing his hold . " Let th ' black buck a'his come an ' get it . " " He ai n't a buck ' ! He 's got a name , you jackass ! " " He ai n't got nothin ' ! An ' we do n't want him in here , " Cruddup said . " An ' we do n't want you in here , Archy ! " J. D. said . " If'n you got any business here , you gon na have to send th ' hunch " " He 's not a ' hunch ! ' " Mr. Archy said . " He 's a hunch , Archy ! A black , buck hunch ! " Silas accidentally dropped the pickle as he raced around the stove for a nose-to-nose  | confrontation : " What would you call somebody bent over with a hump on his back bigger'n Miss Cora 's behind ? ! A hunch ! " " Get'cha filthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Th ' color'ds was filthy , Archy ! " Silas said . He got closer . " ' Member them , Archy ? R'member color'ds ? Slaves ? Them things that'cha freed ? " " ' Member that black heifer that drove y'out'cha mind ? " Cruddup got closer . " An ' drove Mildred to committin ' suicide ? " J. D. said . " Y'poor of wife , Mildred , " Silas picked up . " A white woman . Gone . D ' ceased . Pois'oned by her own self . " " That 's somethin ' else agin you , Archy , " Okra said , trying to emulate Silas . " A bony-feed daughter of Red Springs , a maid'n of th ' South ! Kilt herself ! " Silas said , adding emphasis by picking up the sawdustcaked pickle and cramming it back into his mouth . " An ' beside stealin ' all her money an ' makin ' her commit suicide , you ruined th ' best set o'pink cheeks this side of the Miss'sippi ! " Mr. Archy 's face tightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten , low-down , good-for-nothin ' bastards ! " J. D. crinkled his nose and sent a blotch of dark saliva splattering in the center of the man 's face . Mr. Archy stood motionless . J. D. took it one step further . He rolled his tongue around his tobacco-darkened mouth and heaved another load at him , and without waiting for a reaction , he turned his back . " Drag his ass out'a here , " J. D. said . Wisely , Mr. Archy left under his own power . On the way back to the plantation , he was far too angry to think about what happened that day . But it was a day that the men in the store would never forget . It was the day , as they had alleged , when Mr. Archy made that godawful decision , that terrible decision that retarded a town and crippled a way of life . A decision that stabbed the fields and robbed them of a right . A decision that hurt like a giant , wayward boomerang that zoomed from his plantation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hundred worlds and then U-turned back to the starting point . And Silas , as nutty as he was , had every  | right to strut and bring the point home : Archibald McBride freed the slaves . Though McBride delayed their emancipation by many years ? he freed them just the same . The chorus of naysayers had changed over the years , but the contents had not . Dammit to hell , Archibald McBride ! You did n't have to do it ! What'n th ' hell was ailin ' you ! Didn ' you know how well off we was ? Didn ' you know how well off you was ? Jee-zus H. Ker-rice ! You didn ' have to be sittin ' up there on that big of pillar 'd porch of yours that day , sippin ' rum an ' lemonade an ' starin ' out at th ' darkies pluckin ' away out in them distant fields and have to worry . They was happy , Arch ! An ' you was happy ! An ' Ben , sittin ' there at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our combined twenny-nine slaves , we was happy ! Everybody was happy ! Life was a bed of roses ! Don'cha like roses , Arch ? . . . Arch ? Archy , did th ' rum a'fect you that much ? Or was it that lil ' black heifer , Charlotte ? Did she drive you totally out-'cha mind by workin ' on you at night when Mildred wo n't there ? An ' speakin ' of Mildred , Arch , where was she that night an ' day that ' cha freed ' em ? Somebody said she 'd made a second trip into Fayetteville . Why ? An ' with some kinda papers , Archy ? An ' who was that with her , Arch ? Who drove her ? Why was they there ? How come Mildred wo n't there to put a stop to that nonsense ? She was nuts , but she was a woman of th ' South . She said she didn ' like slaves , but we know better . She wouldn'a let you turn ' em loose . She 'd a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd a done . We 'd a tied you and that black heifer to a tree an ' tared an ' feather 'd th ' life out'a both'a y'all . Speakin ' of Mildred , for one more lil ' thing , Archy . Didn ' somethin ' happen in Fayetteville that none'a us know about , includin ' you ? But let 's get back to that god-awful day you call 'd " freedom day , " that day that you shock 'd ' em , an ' like Silas was sayin ' , when you stood on th ' porch actin ' like you was th ' preacherman . It must be said that the preceding account did not occur . The false hearsay as to how Mr. Archy went about freeing the slaves had been around for so long that now it had cemented itself as fact . What was true , and not a figment of somebody 's imagination , was that on the  | day in question , Ben , as ordered , had been all around the plantation rounding up the slaves . His last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony he hollered out to the workers : " Mr. Archy say come there ! " It was just that simple , but the slaves knew something was up . The tipoff came from house boy number two ( aged forty-seven ) . Houseboy number one had stolen enough goods to keep him in happy independence for about a year . He had pilfered everything that was n't nailed down from the storage house , and kept the booty buried underneath some self-made gravemarkers . What gave him away was the newly dug dirt and some names he had x 'd on the wood . They were a little too unfamiliar . One day , led by Reverend Terrell , New Hope 's pastor , and brother Cromardy , the church 's head deacon , a group went to the cemetery and dug for name confirmation . The church services that Sunday were characterized by an unmistakable threat of eternal damnation  --  which would be expedited by the clear-cut rule : Stealing from the master was an act punishable by hanging . If the culprit was n't fingered , the selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not trusting the latter , houseboy number two tearfully explained the errors of houseboy number one 's ways and went on to relay his personal suspicions about Mr. Archy 's impending decision . Houseboy number one was forgiven , but he was never heard from again .  | Docility and obedience were the hallmarks of being a good slave . Archibald McBride had very good slaves , and it was a monumental day in the lives of the very good slaves . They had quite properly gathered around the porch as very good slaves , different this time , because they had hope and anticipation . Some thought a speech was in order . Others thought a ceremony of some sort . Perhaps a document or a piece of paper would be given , one that they were not able to read , but something to hold on to , something that they could show the world that they were members of humankind , that they had names , birth dates , family ; that they belonged , and had belongings . That they were free , and that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the chains , the ropes , the guns , the swamps , the mean-jawed traps , and the tracking bloodhounds . They did not have to worry about being tarred and feathered . No longer would there be the fear of running through the woods and thickets and encountering all the things that conspired against ungranted freedom . Your souls would have a redemptive moral compass , a compass of a renewed spirit , pointing the way , advising that although you are a freed people , your rejoicing should be held at a minimum because the unshackled troubles are not over . But saying first that I , as a slaver , was wrong . We , as slavers of over four million of God 's children , were wrong , and saying , too , that a nation that condoned the institution , a nation that was founded on the principles of equality and justness , abandoned decency and ignored its covenant ,  | was wrong . On behalf of that nation , my people , and myself , I offer my apology , and along with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways in a land whose customs and ways you do not know , and among a people that will remain forever hostile to you and all that will be yours . But Mr. Archy never said any of that . In fact , Mr. Archy never even came out on the porch that day . He sent Ben back out . The simple message his man-servant delivered was ever so quiet . " Mr. Archy said y ' all free " When Ben arrived at the store , the setting had not changed from when Mr. Archy had arrived . He did n't expect change . But he did expect trouble , because when Mr. Archy came back , he was wordless . He quietly drove into the fields , gave him the money without saying anything , and he left . That was not a good sign . The same three or four lazing old-timers were up on the stoop decorating the front of the store , and Silas , just off to the left , was back resoaking his feet in the pickle barrel and at the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the brine all while taking in the sights . Looking off to his right , as he had done with Mr. Archy , he peered off , saw Ben 's wagon approaching and unnecessarily cleared his throat to Okra , Cruddup , and Tonic : " 01 ' Arch did send th ' hunch , after all , didn ' he ? " Silas said . When Ben got there , he did n't look at any of them directly , he simply pulled the wagon up front , climbed down , and quietly started hitching the wagon to the post . Silas waited until he had finished and said , " Lemme ask ya somethin ' , Hunchy ol ' boy . How come when Archy freed th ' othern 's , you didn ' scat out outta here with ' em ? Wouldn'a been ' cause you was scare't of what they would'a done to you , since you almost broke y'back bowin ' an ' scrapin ' to Arch ? " Ben wisely said nothing , knowing that any word from him would only inflame matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything . Okra shouted , " Mr. Silas done ask 'd you a question , boy ! " Ben took his time . " Mr. Silas , " Ben said . " I think this ol ' back got  | this a'way when I was still in my mama 's belly , when she was runnin ' an ' hurtin ' from slavers an ' troublemakin ' peoples like you . Now it 's my back , an ' I 'm free . I think I got th ' right to bend it an ' scrape it to anybody I want " Silas almost fell out of the pickle barrel . " Lordy-Lord , Lord , Lord , Lord ! Whas done happen to us ? Whas done happen to th ' good of U.S. of A. ? Help us , somebody ! They runnin ' wild ! They kil't th ' town , an ' now they aimin ' for the country , all eight States ! LordyLord , Lord , Lord , Lord . Why , oh Lord , why ? Why would'ja let me weaken to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' for d'liverence from raccoons and colored folks if you wo n't tryin ' to hurt me in some way . I love you Lord Jesus , but my load is gettin ' too heavy to bear . An ' I a-sumes , I said I a-sumes you knows it . Amen and good day . Yours truly , Silas Crookashank . Hey , Doc , J. D. , Shep , y ' all come ou'cheer ! " " Whas'up ? " J. D. could be heard yelling from inside . " We unda attack ! " Silas yelled back , and continued overdoing it to the others . " What 'd I tell y'all ? Didn ' I tell y'all they 'd start gettin ' uppity . Didn ' I tell you ? Huh ? Huh ? Huh ? " The newly arrived man with the cane hobbled out . " Whas ' trou-ble ? " he said . " Him ! Y'shudda heard ' im , Doc ! My Lord , y'shudda heard ' im ! " said Silas , pointing and jumping up and down . J. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd he do ? " J. D. asked . " Takin ' to sassin ' folks , " Silas said . " You 's a liar , an ' you knows it , Mr. Silas , " Ben said . " J'hear that ? J'hear that ? See ! See ! See ! Ai n't even been free long enough to use soap ' n water , an cussin ' a white man already . Lord , why you punishin ' us like this ? Why , 0 Lordy-Lord ? Father of Pickles an ' All Things That Ai n't Greasy , help us ! Help us , Lord Jesus ! " Silas said . J. D. waited until Silas 's sense of high drama had receded , studied the black man for a moment , and said quietly , " You just talked yourself from comin ' in , Ben . " Ben responded just as quietly and with a look to the store owner , he said , " I didn ' hear Mr. McMillan say nothin ' about it "  | " He ai n't got to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cane hobbler . McMillan quietly said , " Better git , Ben . " Ben was surprised . Mr. McMillan , he always thought , was a bit more reasonable than the rest of the Red Springers . There were times when he had been there and the man had actually engaged him in conversation ; such as the time when he inquired about the meetings at the church . One time he even went so far as to say he had heard that there was a new little boy on the plantation . Ben had explained that the child was his , and that he was in good care . Mr. McMillan wished him luck , gave him a little piece of licorice , and told him to make sure that the boy got it . Indeed , McMillan was the best of the bunch ; the licorice and the church inquiry were nice gestures , Ben thought . He also remembered the boy so loved the candy that he wanted to buy some at a later time and McMillan said he was out of it and would n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wagon , and thought about it again . Still , at the time , giving candy for the boy , and asking about the church were mighty nice gestures , indeed at the time . Perhaps the store owner would have a change of heart one day . Apparently the store owner was not thinking the same thing . " Git , " McMillan repeated . " An ' do n't even think of bringin ' y'black ass back here a'gin , " the cane holder said with finality .  | " Th ' bastards . The rotten , low-down , dirty , good-for-nothin ' , bas-tards , " fumed Mr. Archy , already waiting in his front yard , and without Ben having to say anything , he stood there fuming . " I ough t 'a go into town an ' shotgun every single one of ' em . Th ' no-count bastards ! " Ben sat , his hands still wrapped in the reins . " Maybe , " he said slowly , " maybe we ough t 'a go to Fayetteville , Mr. Archy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired . " We ai n't goin ' a gawdamn place but back to Red Springs " " That 's gon na spell a lot ' a trouble , suh . " " You ever known me to be afraid of trouble ? " " Nosuh , but ? " " But ' hell ! " Mr. Archy said , and spun back into the house . Inside , he went directly for the shotgun and went into the pantry drawer for the shells . On his way back out he crammed the chamber and jammed the rest of the shells into his jacket pocket . " Let 's go , Ben , " he said , hurrying off the porch . " Y'kno , Mr. Archy , " Ben said with true reasoning in his voice . " I was just thinkin ' , if we goin ' back to town , why not wait ' til it gets dark . " Mr. Archy hopped on the wagon . " For what reason ? " " Maybe Mr. McMillan 'll be alone an ' I can talk to ' im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a real what-for ? " " Well ? " Ben said .  | " Wait for what , Ben ! For what ? " " I 'm thinkin ' . " " You do n't think . I think ! Now , let 's go " " Mr. Archy . Please let 's not do it . Please let 's do n't go . An ' I ai n't sayin ' it b'cause I 'm scared . But there 's trouble there . An ' there 's a heap of them , an ' only two of us . " " Move th ' wagon ! " " Mr. Archy ? " " Move this gawddamn wagon , Ben ! " " Suh ? " " I said , move the wagon ! " " Think about what I said b'fore , Mr. Archy . We do n't have to go to that store . It 's better to go to Lumberton anyhow . There 's more stuff there . It 'll only take us an hour more . Then there 's Fayetteville " " You gon na move this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suh , but I ai n't gon na move it . An ' I ai n't gon na let you move it . I jus ' ca n't . " " You ai n't gon na let me ? Why , you ? ! " And with that , the plantation owner punctuated his feelings by lifting his foot and cramming it into the laborer 's side , knocking him clear out of the wagon . Mr. Archy then slid over , leaned out , and in a fit of boiling anger blasted : " You do n't let ' Archibald McBride do a gawddam thing ! I freed you , but you are still a gawddam slave , and a slave do n't let me or no white man do nothin ' ! Y'understand that , you black bastard ? " Ben remained crookedly motionless on the ground and made no attempt to counter the man . Mr. Archy blistered him again . " Get up ! " Still Ben would n't move . " Gawdammit , I said up ' ! " The old black man slowly answered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and taking his own good time , he carefully put his foot on the step as though to make the swing to sit down . Instead , he sent a frightening and stinging back-handed slap across the white man 's face . He slapped him again , and hopped back down .  | Mr. Archy reacted in horror and , in doing so , accidentally kicked the breaking lever forward . In panic , the mare bolted and galloped forward . Mr. Archy fought for the reins . Controlling but not stopping the fast-moving vehicle , he shouted back , " Im gon na kill youuuu , Ben ! Y'hear me ? When I get back , you 're dead ! When I get back , you 're dead ! Dead ! Dead ! You hear meeee , Bennnn ! You 're dead ! " Ben heard him , but one would have never known it . Not giving vent to his feelings one way or the other , he simply stayed on the ground and turned his head to the most unexpected direction . He settled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a blur . " That Archibald McBride has got to be th ' dummes ' thing I 've ever seen in my life , " Silas announced from his regular spot on the stoop . The wagon was blistering the final approach . " Hey , J. D. y'all come on out ! Th ' man is crazy . Plum ' loco " Silas said . The old man with the cane was there and led the others out to the stoop . J. D. , trailing , waited for the wagon to get closer . " That 's far enough , Archibald McBride , " J. D. said . Mr. Archy ignored him and brought the wagon to a stop . It was ill advised . The old man with the cane led the charge . That , too , was ill advised . He broke from the porch , cane held high , and promptly fell clown the two steps , and was out . " Now , y'see what you done done , Archy ; You done kil't th ' only doctor in Red Springs ! Y'done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas said , coming down to check the man 's condidtion . Silas was wrong on both counts . The man with the cane was not dead , and was not a doctor . He laid claim to the title , but a doctor he was not . He was a former Klansman and snake-oil salesman from Mississippi who had arrived in town some forty years before . He was lost and thought Red Springs was the port of the Cape Fear River . Someone peered into the back of his wagon , saw the little bottles of oils that bounced on top of two sheets and a pointed hat , and promptly announced that there was a doctor in town .  | Silas withdrew an ear from the man 's right shoulder . " His heart ai n't no more . It is my solum duty t'say th ' doc is dead , " Silas said . Mr. Archy stepped over the body and tried to push past the idiocy . He was blocked . " Out of my way , you worthless piece'a trash ! " Mr. Archy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' th ' biggest piece'a trash born a foot pass th ' Mason-Dixon is you . An ' do n't you f'get it ! " Silas continued . " He wo n't f'get it , " said Tonic . " He 's got somethin ' home to keep ' im reminded . " " I 'm gon na tell you somethin ' , " Mr. Archy said . " An ' it goes for all'a you  --  to include this ignoramus on th ' ground . An ' do n't y'all f'git it . Some of th ' slave children that left Red Springs had light skin . They didn ' get light skin by bathin ' in milk or usin ' bakin ' soda or flour . Ev'ry last one of you at least tried to have a colored woman ? an ' more than a few of ' em is dead and buried because you animals couldn ' take no for an answer . " " But none'a us would'a had they lil ' black bastards , " J. D. said with his usual cruelty . " Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shep said . Pointless to argue the matter further , Mr. Archy tried again to push his way up the two steps . Cruddup blocked him with his body . On the move , J. D. , Shep , and Tonic grabbed him around the waist and collar . A clumsy , staggering old-timer 's struggle ensued , culminating with the main two , J. D. and Mr. Archy , spinning off the stoop and then down to the side of the wagon , where Cruddup rejoined them by tossing J. D. aside and pressing his full body weight against the older man . He sent the body arching toward the seat . Fully encouraged by the group , Cruddup pressed harder . Mr. Archy tried desperately to fight the stronger man off . He could n't . Mr. Archy appeared to be going down . " Now , y'gottem ! Y'gottem now , Cruddy-crud ! " Silas said , jumping up and down , leading the cheering . " That'szit ! That'szit ! That'szit ! " " Hog-tie , ' im , Crud ! Break his back ! " Shep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged McMillan .  | " Tie his pecker to th ' spokes ! " Silas said . The encouragement continued . Cruddup , lifted the man and landed a blow to the side of his head . Mr. Archy 's head reeled back in pain and drops of blood cornered his mouth . Cruddup released him for a fraction of a second . The body slid partway down . Cruddup then charged in with a bear hold . Mr. Archy was gasping for air . The men whooped louder . Cruddup pressed harder . Struggling and pushing himself up Mr. Archy was finally able to free an arm , dip it in the wagon , and send his fingers pawing and stretching for the rifle under the seat . He barely got a hand on it , and when he was fully able to grasp it , he clutched it by the barrel , braced himself , and pushed his body forward , simultaneously unloading a mouthful of bloodied spit directly into his oppressor 's eye . Cruddup dipped back defensively and , in an instant , Mr. Archy sent a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the weapon . The big oaf reeled back dizzily and clutched his head in pain . The men fell silent as Cruddup staggered around and then slumped to the ground . After the initial stunning moments had worn off , J. D. spat at Mr. Archy and called him an " unfair , lowdown , dirty dog , " and urged the group to " git ' im " Silas backed him by shouting , " Wha'cha 'll waitin ' on ? He done kilt't two peoples ! " " Git'im ! " J. D. ordered again . " Tie his pecker to the spokes ! " Silas shouted . The group made a tentative move . Mr. Archy leveled the rifle . " One step in my direction an ' I 'll blow a hole right through you " " Archibald McBride , you ai n't got th ' nerve ! " J. D. said . " Try me . " No one would . They stood there crouchlike , each of them waiting for the other to make the move forward . Nobody moved  --  nobody except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was now coming to . Back at the standoff , Mr. Archy shouldered some of the blood away from his mouth and made a feigning move , as if to get back on the wagon . The group started to close in.  | Mr. Archy leveled the weapon : " Don'cha be no fool . " " Takes courage t ' pull a trigger , Archy , " J. D. said , " an ' that 's somethin ' you ai n't never had . " " One more step an ' I 'm gon na have your life . " " You scare't , Archibald McBride ; y'scare't , " Silas hollered over , having slipped back to the barrel and was now alternately fanning , kicking , and sending his pickle-inspired little toe digging up Cruddup 's drippingly crowded nasal passage . " Y'jus ' plain scare'tan ' y'aint doin ' nothin ' but runnin ' off at th ' mouth ! " " Try me " Archibald McBride meant business , and the rest of them knew it . They held off . As they stood there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas 's antics with the prostrate Cruddup . " Get up , y'lazy good-fer-nothin ' ! Get up ! Y'sleepin ' on th ' job ! " " Silas , th ' man 's hurt ! " McMillan shouted . " That ai n't no excuse ! " Silas blurted back , and then proceeded to kick the man . " Get up , y'lousy , good-fer-nothin ' , hog-smellin ' lunkhead ! I said up ! " " Silas , ca n't you see th ' man 's hurt ! " McMillan said again . " What I see is him sleepin ' ! " Silas retorted while giving another kick to Cruddup 's rear end . " Up , I said . We got work t'do ! " Finally , Cruddup reeled back into consciousness , and under Silas 's barrage he staggered to his feet , clutching his head and moaning , " Where I 'm at ? Where I 'm at ? " " Where th ' hell y'think ? Where y'big dum ' b'hind is always been ! " Silas said , aiming and delivering another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' finish wha'cha stared . " The big man looked around and tried vainly to bring the surroundings into focus . Had he been able to see , he would have seen Mr. Archy had already climbed aboard the wagon and was preparing to rid himself of the nonsense . Shep was the first one to spot him . " See , y'runnin ' , Archy , jus ' like th ' coward y'allus been ! " Mr. Archy stopped . " Nobody calls me a coward . " " Then why you runnin ' ? " Shep said .  | Quietly , businesslike , Mr. Archy picked up his rifle , and climbed hack down . " Your move , " he said . Once again everyone was circled ; and once again everyone was afraid to make the move . The other man who had been knocked senseless by his fall from the two stairs , and the man whom Silas had pronounced dead , was on his hands and knees , patting the dirt for his cane . Silas was standing on it . " Move , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " I ) ammit , I said move ! " The big dumb one charged , responding to the command . And in that same instant , Mr. Archy 's big , booming shot sent the body back wickedly . It contorted in the air and fell lifelessly to the ground . No one , including Mr. Archy himself , had ever thought such a thing would happen . He , as they , were all talk . To kill someone ( anyone other than the totally accepted practice of dropping an errant slave ) had never been a way of life in Red Springs . Hatreds , dislikes , disagreements , mistrusts : All of those things had been allowed to smolder , fester , simmer , and to occupy idle minds , and occasionally take the form of air-bloated threats , that would eventually follow them to the grave , and there to rest . But now that was gone too . Silas , J. D. , Shep , McMillan , and the other four or five men now realized that another change had come to Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in peace , nurtured in slavery , and sabotaged to death by the unholiness of one Archibald McBride . Now he 'd done it again . Mr. Archy came to the slow realization that a man was dead . He looked at the body again , and then at the men . In panic he withdrew anti scrambled aboard the wagon under their still-stunned eyes . Pulling tightly at the reins and bearing down hard on the mare 's rear with the strap , the buckboard spun around and drove off recklessly . Of the men , J. D. was first to collect himself . " Well , that did it , " he said . " I never thought this kinda thing would ever happen in th ' Red Springs , " intoned McMillan . " McMillan go in back an ' get'cha wagon , " ordered J. D.  | " An ' while you back there , Mac , git some kerosene , " said Silas . " An ' rags , " J. D. said . " Them you wearin ' will do nicely , " Silas added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short order the wagon was loaded . The cane hobbler , back to life and seeking support on the kerosene drum , said : " Mac , do n't feel like there 's ' nuff kerosene in here " " S ' puff . " J. D. climbed from over the backseat and gave the drum a look . " Ai n't ' nuff kerosene in here to singe a bug 's nuts . Y'all go get some bottles an ' fill it all th ' way up , " J. D. said with menace . " We goin ' to start a fire , not a roast "  | Never had Mr. Archy fractured the road as he did that day . It was all the more difficult because he was driving Ben 's wagon and not the buckboard . He had n't driven a wagon in over thirty years , but still he was able to manage . The entire countryside whizzed by in a blur , and he gave no thought to slowing the pace . He knew the towners would he coming soon . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veer to the left as he had done earlier ; rather , he stung the mare over to the smaller road that led to Ben 's place ; and before even getting to the yard , he was yelling for Ben . " Ben ! Benn ! Bennn ! " When the wagon rumbled into the yard , he was still calling for his black servant . " Ben ! Ben ! " He continued shouting as the wagon came to a rolling stop . Quickly , he hopped down and went to the door , which was never closed in summer . " Bennnnnnnn ! " He heard nothing in return , so he whirled back to the wagon . Aboard , he stood and squinted off into the fields . He did not see Ben . He sped off anyway , hoping a closer look would find him . But Ben was not to be found in the fields that day . He and the boy were spending the afternoon at the bank of the creek , something he had never done in his entire life . Moses was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't know whether to stand , or sit , or kneel , or squat  --  and for a while tried to do all four at the same time . He elected to sit only after Ben had assured him that sitting was a luxury the other three could n't afford . The boy sat , but he still was n't quite content . He wanted his uncle to participate  --  to run , jump , ride , and to lead the cavalry . The  | uncle , of course , would have none of that . Still , there was unbridled joy in having the wrinkled and leathered and tired old love right there beside him , right there in his favorite spot in all the world : the creek . They were at the creek , and they were n't being bothered by anyone . A great occasion like that , though , had to be questioned . He started off by asking why was he there , and where was Bess and the wagon . Then the boy rattled off what must have seemed like a thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a pebble into the water . Unca Ben , why this ? Why that ? What is that ? What is this ? How come this ? How come that ? Who was this ? Who was that ? The questions went on and on . But each time he would come back with the unhurried refrain , " Unca Benny . . . it shore is good you here . " It was good . The loneliness of the long summer days had come to an end  --  for both of them . As Ben had explained , he would be spending more time with him . They would enjoy the creek together , and although it was not much , whatever they had , from this day forward , they would enjoy it together . In answer to a " how-come " question , the uncle had been honest enough to say or had delicately suggested , that there would be a slight change taking place , and that he had done something not to Mr. Archy 's liking , and that the consequences could be far-reaching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live in the woods and make do off of the land . That was not the worse thing the boy could have heard . In fact , in thinking it over , it was downright pleasing and he could n't wait until the subject was further explored . Although the tone of voice the uncle had used was not exactly uplifting , the subject matter certainly was , and that sent him through a series of more questions . The uncle gently steered him back to the possibility of dire consequences , and added that if anything ever happened to him , he was to grow up strong , and be just and honest in everything that he did . Strange , thought the boy . That was the same thing that Sweet Elsie Pratt had told him that long-ago night just before she left . Wonder where she went ? Wonder when she comin ' back ? God , how he missed her . " Unca Benny " A delayed thought was made audible . " What is just , and what is right ? "  | They were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Was that right ? He would go through life without privilege . Was that just ? " I s'pect you 'll learn in time , son . " That was not the answer the boy was looking for . Nor was it the answer Ben would have usually given . That in itself was not right , nor just . The boy sat there and permitted the cool mud to ease through his toes , he felt a wee bit slighted . He would n't pursue the matter though . Rather , his mind went back to something the uncle had touched on when he first got there  --  something he had said before the living-in-the-woods idea  --  and something he had said with far more conviction . " But if you did go to Fayetteville to stay  --  well , y'didn ' say nothin " bout me goin ' too ? " It should have been an automatic assumption that anywhere the uncle went , he would go too . But , again , there was something about the way the uncle had said it . Ben , obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes planted upward . " Well , like I said b'fore , no matter where I go , I 'm gon na always come back an ' spend time with you . We gon na spend more time togeth'r than we ever did before , " Ben said . " Unca Benny , you tryin ' to say if you went away from here , I ca n't go ? " " Well , son , tek'nically speakin ' , I ca n't take you away . " Ben wanted to say more but could n't , and even if he could , it was too late to stop the tears that flooded the young eyes and cherubic face . Youth spoke . He wanted to run . He did not think about riding his horse . He did not think about being a soldier and charging . All he could think about was motion : his legs in motion , carrying him away from a world teetering on the verge of collapse ; and he could hear the sound , that awful tumbling and rolling and shattering sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being alone . It was far more tragic ; a love  --  a belonging was being destroyed . " Unca Benny , you would n't really leave me , would you ? " The old man got up and went to be close to him . And then he hugged him . " Never in a million years , son . Never in a million years . "  | While Mr. Archy searched the fields for his laborer , searching maniacally , row by row , thinking maybe he would find Ben sleeping under a patch of corn , the Red Springers had already wagoned in to his place and had commenced rolling the big kerosene drum on the porch . Tonic and Okra had already taken the smaller containers upstairs and had begun soaking the furniture under the running commentary of the cane hobbler , who , though bandaged and still feeling the effects of the tall , had taken it upon himself to be scout . Purposely spilling as much kerosene from the air hole as possible , McMillan and Shep , under the direction of Commander Silas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the long hallway to the kitchen , where they encountered unneeded difficulty getting through . McMillan became discouraged after several tries and suggested going ; ill the way back to Red Springs for smaller containers . " Y'gawddang nut , " Silas flared . " We fill 'd it up ! An ' all y'gotta do now is find somethin ' t'punch another hole in it and let it drip from right there ! " " Y'ever tried punchin ' a hole in a kerosene drum ? " McMillan shot hick . " It 's a hell'va lot quicker'n goin ' ? " " Silas ! " J. D. yelled , rightly cutting him off . " Just bend over an ' remove th ' screw cap ! " " I didn ' know it had one , " said McMillan , the storekeep and owner of the drum .  | The bandaged man with the cane hobbled by , and said , " Shep , you an ' McMillan find a couppla pots an ' pans an ' take some ' a that stuff an ' help ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found the pots and pans on the bottom shelf of the pantry  --  and thinking about a resale , started wiping and blowing off the dust . " McMillan , dangblastit ! " Silas said . " We ai n't here for dinnah ! " During the pandemonium , J. D. went to the stairway and hollered up , " Okay  --  c'm on down . We got ta go . Arch 'll be back any minnit ! " " J. D. , where d' ya s ' pose ? " He broke it off . J. D . did n't have any more of an idea as to where Archy was than he did . But what stopped Silas was something he spotted in the living room . It was always his intention to pocket a few loose items , but it was the two portraits that grabbed his attention . In the South , it just did n't happen . It just did n't happen that a plantation owner would have a portrait of a black girl so prominently displayed . And , to make matters worse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silas would have thought worse had he seen the gravestones ; still , he was so disgusted , he could n't even steal anything . Outside , everyone was contentedly in place . McMillan was about to inch the wagon away . The man with the cane , and the bandage that had now slipped down and seriously impaired his vision , had felt his way to the driver 's seat , and assuming they were on the road , he was ordering McMillan to put on some speed . McMillan was trying to get around to telling him that they were not yet moving , when J. D. , rather soberly , came up with an inquiry : " Ai n't y ' all forgettin ' some-thin ' ? " He had asked it as though they had all day to spare . McMillan stopped the now inching wagon . " What ? " he asked . Except for the man with the cane and impaired vision who was busy wondering where daylight went , they all looked at one another . Nobody had forgotten anything . J. D. raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yeah , " said Silas . " We f'got to find Archy so 's we could tie him to a tree an ' cut his pecker off . " " Is that wh'cha came here for ? "  | " We came here , " sputtered the cane man now struggling with the bandage . " We came here t'set th ' place on fire . " " Do you see anything burnin ' ? " The cane man , struggling with the head bandage that had slopped down and covered his eyes , wanted to say , " I ca n't see anything " Silas beat him to the punch . " It ai n't burnin ' ! " " Dammit ! " J. D. fired . " Will somebody get off'a this wagon an ' go an ' set fire to the gawddamn house ! " No one had a match . They sat there in stony silence , eyeing each ether , accusing each other . Of all the dumb , stupid , idiotic things to dolt was up to Tonic , the half breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a match . They could n't fire the stove or light the kerosene lamps without them . Quietly the man who had always hid the Indian side of his heritage hopped down from the wagon and walked the few yards back to the house . He took his time going inside . A moment later he was back out and waited with the others . ' Together they waited a moment more . Soon a slither of flame crawled up the left front window 's curtain . Maybe it was the sight of the flame , but no one said anything at the time , and they felt nothing but a strangeness as the slither grew and reached over to the next window and then joined the forces that blew from the foyer . Soon there was an explosion , and the entire house was seized by a great roar that spearheaded a wicked burst of flames that spewed from every opening . It was the end of the McBride plantation . Strangely , though , for all it meant , there would be no parting shots from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bandaged man with the cane said , " Let 's go . " And they were gone . In the fields Mr. Archy was still traversing the endless rows in search of his laborer and had now gone so far as to conduct the search on his hands and knees . Ben had to be somewhere . But Ben , as he had been since the earlier incident , was at the creek , dozing . So , in a  | sense , Mr. Archy 's suspicion did contain an element of validity . But , conversely , in all the years he had been out in the fields , never once did he entertain the thought of taking a nap , quick or otherwise . The old black man was supposed to be out in the fields working  --  and that was exactly what he did ; even when the pains of sickness racked his body and the curse of fever dimmed his vision and sapped his strength , Ben was out there , working . Though he was no longer a slave , he was still a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple : slaves had no right to get sick ; those that did  --  well , let ' ern die . At the creek Ben dozed contentedly . The boy , simply for the sake of wanting something to do , and not wanting to leave his uncle 's side , got his hoe and playfully swung it over his head . Tilting it up , and angling it in the direction of the house , he spotted the smoke rising over the shrubbery and billowing in the distance . He tried to get his uncle 's attention . And then the smoke really got serious . " You better take a look , Unca Benny , " he said , nudging him . Ben would n't move . The smoke spiraled higher . " Look ! Unca Benny , look ! " Slowly getting the message , after the boy had said it again , Ben rolled over and sleepily shielded his eyes . There was no doubt about it , fire was in the air . Quickly he scrambled to his feet , looked up , and saw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the plantation house that was burning . For an instant he started to hurry in that direction , but he held back . Anticipating the move , the boy had already started to make the long run . " Hold it , son ! " Ben called . The boy , legs still in motion , running in place , looked at him quizzically . " We goin ' home , " Ben said surprisingly . " But , Unca Benny ? " " We goin ' home , son , " Ben said again , this time with more stress . The boy was stunned . " Home ? " " Yes , " said Ben , and pointed . " An ' home is this a'way . " " Why ? Why ? Why ? " the boy demanded . He wanted to know why the uncle would n't fire off with him ; why he wanted to turn his back  | and go the other way . Although it could not be seen from the creek , he knew it was the plantation house burning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the worse thing that could ever happen to anybody . There was a fire at Mr. Archy 's . Mr. Archy needed help . He needed it desperately . The plantation was going to burn to the ground . He reminded the uncle that he had said if someone needed help-anyone  --  help them . Do n't be afraid . Well , he wanted to help , and he was not afraid . The hunched old man did not want to disappoint the boy further . He could not find the words to explain his feelings and those that lay deeper . He looked at the smoke , and then at the boy . Slowly he turned and walked away . The anxious and confused boy looked after him for a bit , and then at the smoke that had now darkened the sky . He would go there . He had to hurry . When Mr. Archy first saw the billowing smoke he was at the extreme far end of the tobacco field . He was still on his hands and knees , looking for the old black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay his move more was the fact that he had strayed too far from the wagon . In truth , even if Mr. Archy had arrived at the house earlier than he did , it would not have mattered . There was nothing he could do . The house could not have been saved under any circumstances . It did not take long for the heat to give testament to the awesome and consummate power of fire . First to be seen , and burning in the foreground , was his horse . His legs had become trapped in the overturned buckboard , and they both went down in flames . The heat shot out and singed everything around it , so much so that when Mr. Archy 's wagon did try to come into the yard , it was stopped even before getting to the outer edge . Crazed , the old man stood up wild-eyed and bore down hard with the whip and yanked angrily at the reins . The frightened mare would go no farther . The man cracked her again . This time the animal responded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , and bolted , throwing the wagon askew and sending the man sprawling to the ground . Though down , he would not stop . With his eyes riveted on the house ,  | he started to crawl forward , his belly clinging to the ground . The closer he got , the more madly the heat blistered out . He would continue to fight forward until the heat became absolutely unbearable , when it seemed as if his entire body had been picked up and devilishly thrown into some sort of man-devouring oven , when the heat parched his skin and seized the passageway to his lungs  --  and it was only then that he stopped the forward progress . He had stopped , but he would not turn around . Instead , he lowered his mouth to a crooked arm and set the free fist pounding in the dirt . When the boy arrived , panting on the outer edge , the man was still pounding in the dirt , uttering over and over and over : " Th ' bastards . Th ' bastards . The dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moses knew he was sinking fast . " Mr. Archy  --  Mr. Archy ? " the boy screamed and screamed . He was not heard . Another gust of scathing heat spewed out . Now the situation was beyond desperate . The boy tried to move in again . He was stopped . " Heat rises , " his uncle used to say when they sat close to the kitchen stove during those long story-telling winters . And so he fell to the ground and began crawling to rescue an old man who had nothing to do all day but try to catch him peeing in the creek and later sit up there on that buckboard with the pretty horse and call him a lil ' black bastard  --  words and thoughts he did not fully understand , and from a man who now , except for his throat-rattling coughing , fell silent and motionless . He had to hurry . The heat told him not to . It was more oppressive now and , mixed with a white , almost clearless smoke , it undulated along the ground snakelike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thin and muffled voice to say : " Hold on , Mr. Archy . Hold on , I 'm coming " He did n't know how , but he was determined to find a way . Off with your clothes , something told him . It was a female voice . It continued . Now take the clothes off and use the clothes to shield yourself He did just that . When he finally reached the plantation owner , his little body could not move him . He tried pulling and yanking on the arms , the legs ; he moved to the head and then back down to the torso . No matter how hard he tried , he could move the unconscious body only an inch or so . Now he could do nothing but cough and cry , and soon he was about to  | lose all reason . This is not the time , said the voice . He knew she was right . Think , she said again . Quickly , now , beyond childlike efficiency , he tied his trouser legs protectively around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he first arrived , he had seen the mule entangled in the wagon and reins . Bess was the answer . He quickly went to her , freed her from the entanglement , and tried to lead her back to the burning house . But the mule was too frightened and yanked for freedom . The only other choice was to mount her , aim her in the opposite direction , close her blinders as much as possible , and then quickly spin her around and charge back for Mr. Archy  --  hopefully reaching him before the mare would again panic and before the man would die . He tried , but the effort failed ; he was too small to even mount the mule . Time was running out , and there was no time to race all the way across the fields to summon his uncle . He did n't have enough time to even make it to the creek . Still , he did not panic . Again he was helped by the voice . She simply said : Think . Steadying Bess , he went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sure enough there was a rope inside . He quickly got it and tied one end to the reins and coaxed the mule back to the area . Bess sensed that she did not have to go all the way in . Placing herself in jeopardy , she was cooperative enough to come in closer than she had before . She came in close enough for the boy to tie the rope around the man 's body . The plantation owner was pulled to safety . " Hi , Mr. Boss Man , " said the boy , his childish exuberance back , his eyes unmoving . They were at his favorite spot , the creek . They had been there for a long while and the boy remained propped up on his elbows , his caring eyes not leaving the man for a second . It was a long time , too , before the seeping dawn of reality had slowly returned to the old man . When he came to , he more or less hoisted himself up to a quasi-sitting position and was cognizant enough to wet-eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawned on him yet and he filled the initial moments rueing the sight that greeted him . The boy , not quite three feet away , squatting in his face . Not only that , he was still naked . So ,  | now , not only did the man have to contend with the boy doing number one ( peeing ) in the creek , damned if he was n't all set to do number two . Small wonder the man was not touched by the boy 's childish exuberance or by the friendliness of the greeting , or anything else he had to offer . When the loss of the house did begin to settle on his cobwebbed mind , Mr. Archy became even more disgruntled . The reason stemmed from the deep-seated belief that the boy was the source of all his troubles . The fact that he , Mr. Archy , selected a black woman to have an ongoing illicit relationship with did n't enter into his thinking at all ; it was the result  --  the boy , that nagging residue of the affair , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything I can do , Mr. Archy ? " Mr. Archy had no evidence that number two had taken place-yet  --  and so he figured he would cut him off at the pass : " Y'can begin by not peein ' in my creek . " " ' K , " said the boy , unable to recall the last time he made a little deposit . Feeling good about it , he picked up a pebble and started to toss it in , but he held up . " Mind if I toss this in ? " There would be no further conversation with the man . He got up and stumbled away . The move did not stop the boy 's concern : " If you lookin ' for y'horse , ai n't nothin ' I can do ' bout that . But if you lookin ' for Bess , she 's this a'way , " he said , helpfully pointing . " An ' if you lookin ' for th ' wagon , h'its back that way  --  but th ' wheel on it is broken . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have somethin ' to ride on " The man did not stop . He ambled on without looking back . Without looking back even at the ruins of the house . The boy scooped up a handful of pebbles , laid back , and arched them individually into the water . Soon the urge would come .  | Dusk settled calmly if not gloomily around Ben 's place ; on came the lamp and the shadowed figure moved away from the window . Ben had moved from the one room to the kitchen . Ben 's kitchen was the center of activity . It said it all . It was the utter depths of poverty . With its stained floor giving way to an old Thatcher stove whose chimney nervously touched a roof that was independent of anything secure , it almost defied description . The walls had never warmed to wallpaper , paint , or varnish , and the shelves that housed the few cooking and eating utensils sagged to U-bolt proportions . In the corner nearest the stove was a pile of chopped wood , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the center of the room was a homemade table with two weak chairs , and there was nothing else . Swinging into the adjacent room , the bedroom , there was a huge , high-posted wooden bed that suffered from age and was covered by a multicolored  --  and multisoiled  --  quilt that , despite its many colors , failed in the attempt to match anything . Diagonally across from the bed was a large trunk and next to it a bottom-hanging , high-backed rocking chair that angled away from the loosebricked fireplace . A lone kerosene lamp nested on a small round table just a few feet forward of the front wall and flanking window . All over the tiny room , including the ceiling , there were faded patches of burlap , paper , and straw jammed protectively in a host of cracks and crevices .  | Ben , who had just stepped outside to answer the call of nature , quietly returned with a pair of damp overalls , and lost his head in the big trunk . He was still scratching and pulling when Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice was not as harsh as it could have been ; to be sure , it had an almost solicitous tinge to it  --  but still , it was Mr. Archy 's . Unnecessarily , Ben decided to go to the window for a confirming look , and just as unnecessarily he shuffled back to the trunk . It was only after he had finished what he had started that he responded , and even then he was not sure about his plan of action . The voice called again  --  and again , oddly , the voice did not become stronger ; it did n't yell out , it did n't command , it continued in that same strange tone . The texture of the voice was noticed even more when Ben went outside to see the man . Out there , there was an even bigger oddity . Mr. McBride was on the porch . Even though he owned it , he had never been that close to the house before . But , to go back , the first thing Ben had noticed was that the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did not have his shotgun . He did n't believe Mr. Archy would have actually used the gun , but he was wise enough to know the irrational mind could n't be trusted . He would wait to see what the man had to say . " Ben , " Mr. Archy said hesitantly , his hair unruly and his mind far from being settled . " Now , Mr. Archy , " Ben interrupted , and in violation of his promise to wait . " If you come here to ? " Mr. Archy stopped him with a wave of the hand : " F ' get all that ? we 'll tend to that later . Right now I need your help . " " If you talkin " bout goin ' after Mr. Silas an ' them , I ai n't gon na do it . " " You ai n't gon na do it ? " " Nosuh " Neither one of them spoke with harshness , yet everything was said with conviction , and Mr. Archy , although seemingly on the verge , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood quietly and searched the presence of the man who would not look at him directly in the eye . He then stared out into the dark . " Ben , what 's got into you lately ? "  | " Nuttin . ' " But you 're tellin ' me what you ai n't gon na do . " " I know that . An ' I 'm tellin ' you I ai n't goin ' into town for no fight-in ' ? an ' I do n't care what you say . " Still with patience : " You ai n't ailin ' , is you ? " " Nosuh . " " Y ' feelin ' all righ ' ? " " Never felt better . " " No ; you ca n't be feelin ' well . So let 's just forget ' bout what you said for now . " " I ai n't gon ' f'get nuttin ' ? an ' I done told you I 'm feelin ' fine . " " Naw , Ben , y'aint . Y'aint been yourself lately . Y'must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . I 'll tell you what  --  gwoan back inside an ' lay down for a spell . We 'll get to that bunch later . Be better if we wait , anyhow . " " I ai n't gon ' lay down , an ' I ai n't goin ' inta town after them peoples later on  --  or any time after later on " " Now I know you ai n't feelin ' right , tellin ' me what you ai n't gon ' do after what all they done done t'my place . Or do you know what they done ? " " Saw th ' smoke from the creek . " " From th ' creek ! From th ' creek ! " Mr. Archy said , hotly shedding the mask of patience and calling hard for the old ways . " Umhum , " Ben said , still maintaining composure . " S'matter a'fact , I was layin ' down at th ' time . " " You mean , " Mr. Archy flustered , " you mean you was layin ' down restin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the gawddam ground ? " " I s'pose that 's a pretty fair way of puttin ' it , " Ben said , calmly moving away from the door and comfortably sitting . " ' Ceptin ' I did n't know they was burnin ' it at first . Then when I did figgure it out , it didn ' bother me none . " " Ben , do you know what you 're sayin ' ? Do you have any idea what you 're sayin ' ? " " Shore do , " Ben said , rocking easily and ignoring hard glares . " But'cha know , I figgered if they did n't shoot you when you went  | into town , they 'd do somethin ' like that . An ' I also figgered that if they did do somethin ' like that , I wo n't gon try an ' stop ' em " " You wo n't gon try an ' stop ' em , ' " echoed Mr. Archy . " Nope . ' Cause if I r'member correctly , you departin ' words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill me ? ' course I didn ' pay that no mind  --  but I did pay a'tention to that thing you said about bein ' free but still bein ' a slave  --  an ' a slave , you said , do n't tell no white man what to do . Now , do I have to r'mind you what Mr. Silas and them is ? " " Ben , you 're an ass , a dum ' black stupid ass ! " Ben looked up coolly at the man who was bearing down hard , and slowly shook his head . " Mr. Archy , " he started to say , comfortably crossing his legs and folding his arms above his head . " This is just one'a them days where we just do n't seem t'be agreein ' a'tall . Ben was a ass , but Ben ai n't no ass no mo ' . " " Where you get off talkin ' like this ! Y'crazy or somethin ' ? Y'outcha mind ? " Ben sprung forward in the chair : " I ai n't th ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! An ' you even crazier if y'think I 'm gon na spend th ' rest of m'life kowtowin ' to you . I ai n't got ta do that no mo ' . An ' I ai n't gon na do that no mo ' . I do n't need you , Archibald McBride . You need me ! " " I need who ? " " Me ! Ben  --  your ol ' darkie ! " Ben said , jabbing himself in the chest . " An ' as dum ' , black , an ' stupid as this ol ' darkie is , you ca n't git along without me ! " " Nigger , I 'll have you lynched " By who ? You ca n't do it yourself ! An ' I purposely  --  purposely-let'cha screw y'self up with Mr. Silas an ' them . You ca n't go to Lumberton , an ' there 's too many of my kinda folks in Fayetteville . An ' you know they do n't like you ! " " Maybe they do n't , Ben , maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with somebody , I do n't think I 'd have th ' problems you would . " " We may be dumb through the next ten centuries , Mr. Archy , but God help the day when my people start pickin ' the ex  --  slave master over th ' ex-slave. "  | " You do n't know your people . An ' as far as that ten ? " Mr. Archy let it drop because it was getting away from the real issue . It was not his thought , but ten centuries might have been stretching it . Ben did have a point though . A very good point . What Mr. Archy wanted to say , and it would have been interesting had he pursued it , was : " An ' as far as that ten centuries goes , your people ai n't gon na last one century , from what I 've seen let alone ten . " He would have said it at any other time , but here he declined in favor of settling for a moment , thinking things over . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said quietly : " Ben , I want you off my property . " Ben responded as if he knew it was coming . " I'da been off a long time ago , Mr. Archy , ' cept ? " " ' Cept what ? " The loudness was about to come again . " Need ? I ask 'd myself that forty years ago ! What do I need you for ? You ai n't got a pot to piss in ! " " An ' you ai n't either . An ' if you do n't believe me , open up your nose an ' smell th ' smoke ! You know what that smoke means ? The smoke means the end , Archibald McBride , th ' end . Your end ! " " My end ? " He even chuckled for a bit , and then he came back : " The end ' my b'hind . " Mr. Archy said it as though holding something in reserve . He made a move , stared out at the fields , and came hack again : " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you an ' nobody like you will ever understan ' . " " I undastans one thing , " Ben said , topping him . " You ai n't got nothin ' . " " Land , Ben land  --  look at it ! G'woan , look ! " Mr. Archy said , gesticulating widely . " Land  --  l-a-n  --  land ! I got land ! " " Mr. Archy , suh , " Ben said quietly . " Every inch , every yard , every mile  --  everything you can lay your eyes on , I  --  me  --  Archibald McBride owns it ! I own lan ' ! " " I beg you pardon , Mr. McBride . " Ben tried to continue with surprising ease , but in a way to strongly emphasize a point to a man going downhill . " You do n't own nothin ' . " " Can y'see it ! " Ben was right . The mind was slipping . " Mr. Archy ? "  | " Lan ' . " I sees , Mr. Archy , but ? " " Damn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sees ai n't yourn " " You lookin ' at lan ' . " " But th ' lan ' ai n't yourn " " Land Ben ! " Mr. Archy shouted , his mind now positively slipping away . " Mr. Archy ? " " Lan ' . " Mr. Archy ! " " Land ! " " Th ' Ian ' , Mr. McBride , " Ben said , coming back , and still with ever so much calm . " Th lan ' ? all of it  --  b'longs to a lit ' black boy by th ' name of Moses . " But it would not register . Mr. Archy 's mind had snapped . " Lan ' , Ben ; 1-a-n . Go ' head ! Set fire to it ! Light it up ! Haw , haw , haw . See ! Ho , ho , ho . See what I mean ? Ho , ho , ho . Hey , you in Red Springs . Hear me talkin ' to you ? Send ' em back ! C'm on back , McMillan . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an ' what about you , Tonic ? An ' that ignorant ass with the cane ! An ' you , Okra , bring y'matches . Cruddup , raise y'self from the dead . Get up ! Get up , you lazy , good-for-nothin ' slob ! C'm on  --  All y'all , let 's have a fire ! Let 's burn Archibald McBride 's Ian ' . Let 's burn th ' sunovabitch to th ' groun ' . Burn th ' bastard outta Red Springs , run ' im out of North Carolina . Run this sunovabitch clean on out of th ' country and all th ' way back to Scotland . Back to his mamma 's belly ! Haw , haw , haw . . . . But wait-a-minnit . Hold it , Ben . Arch ai n't going nowhere . Archibald McBride is still here . An so 's his gawdamn lan ' ! ? Hey , you slaves  --  c'm on back ! They couldn ' kill Archy an ' the lan ' ca n't burn ! They could n't burn th ' lan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! Hee , hee , hee . Hee , heee , heee . . . Land ! Ben , land ! Mine ! " And so it went for a long while . The man , circling the yard , screaming , gesturing , banging on the wagon , and pounding in the dirt . It was so bad that Ben had to leave the porch . He went inside to his bedroom and sat on the trunk , peering out every now and then , making sure  | that the man did not hurt himself . And when he quieted down , he would come back out . What he had to tell the plantation owner could not wait , and if he was at all well enough to hear it , he would tell him . When he got back out to the porch , Mr. Archy had stopped , and was sitting on the step , looking off  --  and as though nothing ever happened . Ben did not wait to ask if he wanted to hear what he had started to say earlier , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Archy , " he said easily . " Is you all righ ' ? " " Are you ? " Mr. Archy said in return . " Yessuh " " Well , if you 're fine , I 'm better . I 'll always be better . " " I 'm glad to hear that , suh , " Ben said , sitting and feeling that the time was right . " B'cause , what I was tryin ' to say to you , is that th ' Ian ' is in Moses 's name . " Mr. Archy continued to stare straight ahead . " Th ' lan ' b'long 's to th ' boy Mr. Archy " " Th ' lan ' belongs to who ? " " Moses . " " Come agin ? " " Moses owns th ' lan ' . " " Who ? " " Moses " " Moses . Th ' boy ? " " Yessuh " " Now I know you sick , " he wanted to say laughing , but he could n't . " No , I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " S'little far-fetch 'd , ai n't it ? " " Nosuh . Not if th ' boy 's in your family . " Mr. Archy 's face tightened . His mind went back , but he did not take off in a tirade . His mouth was in a kind of half-fixed position that seemed to wave off Ben 's credibility . " Nigger , you even crazier'n I thought . " He looked a little strange when he said the word . He shook his head and walked to the edge of the yard . That was another interesting thing about Mr. Archy . He was n't thinking about it at the time but he seldom used the term nigger . Oh ,  | he used it all right  --  he used it twice on Ben . But he never used it with the everyday frequency of the average white or plantation owner . Nigger was a term that was just downright base . He loathed it . There was nothing about it that he liked . Of course , he knew that it had an attachment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but most of the slaves did n't even come from that area . Some even came from Cuba , Haiti , the Bahamas  --  from all over the Caribbean , so he often wondered about the appropriateness of it . No one ever called them Caribs . He often wondered , too , why the slaves would have even answered to something so repugnant as nigger . Of course , they would have been shot , or lynched , or whatever life-ending measure was convenient at the time of infraction  --  infraction meaning not properly responding or being obediently respectful when addressed , but the slaves could have found another way to bury the term . For instance , he thought , why not just simply play dumb ? They did n't understand the language anyway . And if one or two of the slaves had been shot or lynched for the cause , so be it . The whites could n't have killed them all . It would have been economically unfeasible . Why buy something for a day and then go home and shoot it ? But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking nigger was just simply a bad , ungainly word . The blacks should have used some kind of  --  not intelligence , but mother wit perhaps ? Give the term back to the people who gave it to them . Simple . It was such a thought that also had him wondering how long the connection to slavery would last . Not long , he once concluded , but then he heard a new batch of slaves from Ghana calling each other niggers . They were not offended . Oftentimes they laughed . Stupid , stupid , stupid . The connection , he reassessed , would last forever . With his mind fully loaded , Mr. Archy returned to the step and sat . Ben picked up from right where he left off : " I may be crazy , Mr. Archy , but th ' boy own 's th ' land . " And before Mr. Archy could question it , he added : " His maw helped him get it . " There was something in the way the black man had said it . Something that caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the verge of exploding again . Still thinking , he got up and  | strayed back to the yard 's edge and rolled back the years . " His maw ? " He turned back to Ben . " Y'mean Charlotte ? " " S'right , " Ben said knowingly , and louder so that the man could hear him clearly but yet in a manner that sent the other man 's mind hack to the edge : " Nigger , you done lost your mind . " " Like I said b'fore , Mr. Archy , mabbe I is , but that do n't change nothin ' . Th ' boy own 's th ' lan ' . " " Fool , do n't you know a slave didn ' own nothin ' . " He then walked hack to the porch and said in what he thought was edifying clarity . " An ' do n't you know a slave couldn'a given anythin ' away , especially nothin ' of mine ? " " But y'wife could . " Ben said it with such a quiet confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reddened it to an unhealthy degree . He turned his head to question logic , but he could n't say a word . He came back , slid down , and slumped over to the edge of the porch , and there he sat for a long while , gazing at nothing while churning old thoughts through his mind . Mildred , as he had known her , was a hateful , mindless old witch with nothing but spite in a warped heart . There were things she would have done to hurt him . But give away land ? Violate the law and give it to a boy born in slavery ? No , anything or anybody but that . More certain , she never never would have given anything away that could have even been remotely connected to Charlotte . " Y'lying , Ben . " " Then go to Fayetteville , Mr. Archy . " " Ai n't necessary . Ai n't necessary , a'tall . " " Go to Fayetteville , Mr. Archy . " Once again there was something in the way the old black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said it with so much poise , so much calm , with such a calculated confidence that it became a downright challenge . Fayetteville was the county seat . If there were any records at all , Fayetteville would have them . But , no , the whole thing is just too absurd . " Mildred couldn'a done nothin ' like that "  | " Yessuh , she could , " Ben said quietly . " She wouldn ' a " " But she did . " " Even if she wanted to , she couldn ' a . She couldn ' a . It ai n't legal . " And then he thought about it . The conclusion was n't all that satisfactory . Hesitantly , he said it again : " She couldn'a . " " Miss Mildred found a way t'give th ' boy th ' land , Mr. Archy . " " She couldn ' a " They were to go back and forth , and Ben wanted to end it . But not Mr. Archy . " I know wh'cha tryin ' to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mildred wouldn'a done nothin ' like that to me " It had changed from couldn'a to wouldn'a . There was a chink in the armor . " Mr. Archy , " Ben said with hopeful finality . " Think of what you did to her . " That got him . Then again , everything Ben had said seemed to 've merged with a certain kind of well-laid knowledge . His total posture was one of utter ease and contrasted bluntly with that of the man who could n't find a way to respond to the last statement . One thing was certain , the air of absurdity had vanished and that look of wild impossibility gave way to moving clouds of doubt . What bothered Mr. Archy more now was that the boy who , dragging his hoe behind him , came drifting in from a prolonged stay at the creek . He stopped and delivered a light " here I am " wave at the two men . They did not respond to him , not even commenting on his lack of clothing . Sensing his presence was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his room to put on his last pair of pants and came out to the rear and stayed there , looking every bit as though he had been saddled with the chore of rearranging raindrops . " She wouldn'a done nothin ' like that . I know she would n't  --  she just could n't , " Mr. Archy said , and almost with the depths of a plea continued on to say : " Y'lyin ' , Ben . Y'gotta be lyin ' . " " Then like I said , Mr. Archy , go to Fayetteville . You 'll finds th ' truth is in Fayetteville . " What a god-awful moment that was . He wanted Ben to say  --  and  | somewhere deep in his mind he thought he heard him say : " Yessuh , Mr. Archy , I 'm lyin ' , I 'm makin ' this whole thing up . I 'm crazy , an ' I do n't know what I 'm talkin ' about . An ' Mr. Archy , suh , I 'm sorry I caused you hurt by stirrin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' boy was born . It didn ' bother Miss Mildred . An ' even if it did , there wo n't nothin ' she could ' a done about it , anyhow . She was smart , very smart , but even she couldn'a fix a way t'give nuthin ' to no son of a slave . " " What 's that you jus ' said , Ben ? " " I did n't say nuttin ' , Mr. Archy . " " Yes , you did  --  that last part  --  repeat it , Ben . Wha-what was it ? Ben  --  Ben , what was that ? Huh , Ben . Huh ? R'peat wha'cha just said . " " When I said what I said , Mr. Archy  --  I said th ' truth is in Fayette-ville . " " Yes , " he said absently , his mind was away . " Yes  --  that 's where th ' truth would be .... " " In Fayetteville , " Ben added quietly . " In Fayetteville " " In Fayetteville . " " Ben ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the conversation between the two men came to an end . Tomorrow morning he would be in Fayetteville . They had only the one wagon now , and Ben dutifully prepared it for the long forty-mile trip which , because of the hour , would have to be overnight . Mr. Archy thanked him for the effort , checked to see that the lanterns were fore and aft , and except for the crunch of the wheels in the dirt and the cry of aged wood , the wagon rolled away slowly and soundlessly . Ben stood looking after him for a long period , and then ambled to the backyard to collect an armload of wood . Moses sprang out to help him , but rested his case by chin-sitting on the step . " Where was you all'a that time , son ? "  | " Th ' creek . " " D'jew put out th ' fire ? " " Wanted to , but Mr. Archy didn ' want no help , " he said , somewhat pi zzled and without making reference to the rescue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I ca n't . " Ben allowed the remark to pass without comment . " How come you didn ' wan na go over there ? " " Jus ' tired , I guess . " " But you was gettin ' plenty rest by th ' creek , an ' you ai n't never done that b ' fore ? " " Son , as you get older , things change " " That th ' reason you did n't go ? " " I s'pose you can say that , " the uncle said , not wishing to pursue the matter . " Well , since I done said it , how'cum you didn ' go ? " " Now , now , " Ben said , trying to end it . " A feller like y'self shouldn ' be worrin ' ' bout things like that . " " I ai n't worried , " he responded casually . " I jus ' wan na know why you didn ' wan na go " " Questions , questions , questions . Y ' hungry , boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , now , let 's jus ' put a stop to that right now . Gon na fix you somethin ' d'licious . " The boy popped up excitedly : " Like what ? " " Now , y'gotta be careful , " Ben said , aiming him back into the kitchen . " ' Cause this here day is a very special day . " " T'is ? What is it ? " " Let 's jus ' say it 's special . An ' since it is special , we might as well eat special . What 's y'favorite , Mist'r Moses ? " The boy who was about to scoot up to his chair stopped and turned . " Mist'r ? Unca Benny , you jus ' call 'd me a Mist'r . " " You is a Mist'r . " " Oh , no , Unca Benny . Mr. Archy is a Mist'r . " " An ' so is you . An ' he ai n't no better'n you , is he ? "  | " Well , now , I do n't know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got every righ ' t'be call 'd that  --  an ' do n't you ever let anybody take that away from you , y'hear ? " At that point the boy was too occupied rolling the sweet sound of the word around in his mind . " Mis'ter " ? he tried phrasing it in different ways ? " Mist'errr  --  Mizzt'r  --  Mus'tur ? I 'm one'a them ? " " All of ' em . " " All of ' em ? ' Hottt zzziggidy ! " Ben smiled as he shirttailed one of the grubby pots from the shelf . " Now , Mizzt'r , what 'll it be ? " " Ummmm  --  Er . . . Ummmmmm  --  er ! Rice , bacon , an ' peas ! " " But we have that ' ' most every day " " But it 's still my favorite . " The boy was smiling happily . Ben waltzed over and got a pail . " Would th ' Mist'errr like to t'get us some water from th ' pump ? " " Th ' Mist'errr be gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puffed out . The pump reminded him of something else he liked  --  the world beneath the pump . It always held a strange fascination . You could look down the big hole for hours and not see a thing , but when you tossed a rock in it , or a stone , or some tools , or some corn , or a can , or a snake , or a frog , or mule dung  --  almost anything  --  you 'd hear a kerrrrrplunk . Fascinating . Worms , beetles , ants , bees , butterflies , grasshoppers , Junebugs , chicken feathers andlor droppings , would n't do that . No kerplunk . Not fascinating . When the boy returned , and after trying out a new kerplunk with a bottled firefly , Ben had already tossed the kerosene liberally over the chunks of wood and the fire had begun to roar up the stove 's narrow tin chimney . Smoke squatted heavily over the room , and it , along with the fire , sent his mind back to Mr. Archy 's place . But that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place . " Unca Benny , how y'think that fire started over at Mr. Archy 's place ? " Ben busied himself evasively . " Du n no , son , " he said , and then won-  | dered if Silas and J. D. and Shep and McMillan and all the others were satisfied . And if , pray tell , they had anything else in mind . He purposely lost the thought by concentrating on the heavily salted strips of meat that he took out of the lard can and slapped in the pot that bounced on the stove . Since , in cooking , Ben was impressed with directness , he never troubled himself to wash or closely inspect anything , and it was probably due to the long-held belief that anything foreign clinging to meat could do nothing but enhance the flavor . " Unca Benny , " the boy said , thoughtfully curled on top of the table . " Is t'morrow a special day too ? " " From here on out , every day is a special day . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ' mornin ' ? " " Grits ? " " N00000 . " " Okra ? " " N00000 " " How ' bout mustard greens an ' peanuts ? " " Sounds good , but n00000 . " " Corn pons ? " " Like them too , but n0000 . C'm on , Unca Benny . Our really , really , really , really really-really favorite . " " Dumplins an ' collard greens ! " " N0000 " " Bread ' n lard ? ! " " N00000 . " " Bread ' n buttermilk ? ! " " C'm on , Unca Benny ! " " Then what ? " " Fatback ' n blackstrap molasses ! " he said , forgetting he would walk eight acres for cracklin ' bread and okra . And another two for pork rinds or pigs ' feet . And if he had been thinking right at all , he would have said licorice  --  lightly fried . How that came about was when McMillan gave Ben that little bit of licorice that time , Ben brought it home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy ate it ,  | MI in love , and looked as though he 'd walk on water for another piece . He still would . " Fatback ' n blackstrap molasses ! " " Oh , sure , " Ben said , glad that the boy had forgotten about the licorice . Feeling good , and again not exactly going by the book , he dumped a kettle of partially shelled peas into the water , and as an afterthought added a ladle full of dark , spotted lard . " Yessuh , we can have as much of anythin ' as we want . An ' you know somethin ' else ? We can eat as long as we want to . I do n't have to go in the fields no mo ' . " " Y'aint ? " " Hope . " " Y'mean y'kin stay ' round here all day ? " " Ummhum " " Hottttziggidy ! " " Yep , I ai n't goin ' back in them fields no mo ' . Them fields done see th ' last of y'ol ' unca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ' em ? " " Wouldn ' think so " " Who gon ' tend to ' em ? " " Beats me " " Hmmmm . . . well , h'its shore nice you ai n't got ta go out there , " he said happily . " An ' h'its shore is nice of Mr. Archy not to let you go out there . Is that what y'all was talkin ' bout ? He seemed a lil ' mad . " " Not exactly . " " Then what ? Did he get mad at your singin ' ? " " No . T'wont that . " " Y'kno , I like that song , " he started singing , " Go down Moses " and said . " It 's got my name in it . " " Glad you do . " " Y'reckon that 's why Mr. Archy likes it ? " " Do n't think so . " He took his time coming up with , " Unca Benny , do I have a last name ? "  | " You have one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sweet Elsie Pratt had one . " " T'wont hers . " He rolled over on the table . " That 's one thing I 'd really like to have . A last name . " He took a moment more . He gave it more thought and asked , " Did Sweet Elsie Pratt like my name ? " " S'pect so " " Wished I know 'd where she went . " He moved , and put a thoughtful hand under his head . " I miss her . " Ben would not comment . The boy plowed on . " What was my mamma like ? " " Tol't you b'fore , son  --  you never had one . " It was coldly delivered ; it was coldly received . The boy fell quiet . And then he started humming : " Go down , Mo-ses ... " ' He broke it off and fell quiet again . More quiet moments passed and , unable to sit without fidgeting and animatedly thinking , he got up and circled aimlessly around the table , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . He was out there for a full ten minutes , at the pump , searching , thinking ; he then scooted back in and moseyed over to the stove to savor the sweet smell of the pot 's contents . There was only one bad thing about a good meal , he thought . It just takes too long to cook . He elbowed his way back up on the table : " Unca Benny , you think Mr. Archy eats as good as us ? " " Not quite , m'boy . " " How come ? " " Welllll , a man like that pr'bly ai n't got the taste . " " Wha'cha think he eats ? " " Lotta funny things . " " S'what I figgered . . . no fatback an ' blackstrap molasses . An ' no corn pons . " He evaluated it for a moment , and added : " Jus ' ca n't undastan ' people like that " " Well , do n't be in no hurry , son , " Ben said as he sampled another mouthful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pot to the table . " I ai n't too sure he can undastan ' you . "  | The boy was too busy thinking to have gotten the last part of the statement . Thoughtfully , he drummed his fingers on the table and mused , rather disconsolately , as Ben slid a battered tin plate in front of him " No corn pons  --  an ' n0000 fatback ' n molasses . An ' I bet he ai n't never ever heard of fried licorice . " Poor Mr. Archy . And a poor Mr. Archy it was . At that point in time he was stroking the wagon to Fayetteville and , among other things , he was not all that happy with the mode of transportation . The mule was deplorable and slow , and far worse than the highsprung buckboard , Ben 's old wagon shook and creaked miserably and surely did n't look as if it would make it even part of the way to Fayetteville . He had no such thoughts when he used the wagon going to and certainly when he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , and it would be a long journey , cutting six miles on the other side of Red Springs before even getting to Lumberton . Even so , the tiny burg would be closed by the time he passed through , and there was only one other town in his path . No question , the ride would be nothing but one dark and miserable pain with nothing to soothe him but the monotony of yesterday 's South . Accompanying him , too , were intermittent thoughts of Mildred and that unholy day she decided they would marry . They had taken this same road . That was a bad day then ; this was a bad day now  --  and , coupled with that , were all the strains and pressures of a woefully newfound concern . What a miserable day this had been . There was the bitter confrontation with Silas and J. D. and that numbskulled bunch , culminating with a shooting  --  no , a killing ; the outrageous and shocking insolence of Ben ; the burning down of his place ; the loss of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that , there was that pesky little pee-dripping son of  --  son of who 's ? Certainly not mine . I do n't have to own up to anything like that . Gads , what a day . But the most stabbing of all  --  the thing that really did it , the killer , the thing that got right down to the gritty core and wrenched every single nerve and seized every single solitary fiber in his gaunt old body and sat his conscience talking , were those words . What words they were  --  O000h , what satanic-sounding , brutal , and sav-  | agely cruel words : " Th lan ' ai n't yourn . Th ' lan ' ai n't yourn , Mr. McBride . Th ' lan ' ai n't yourn . " " But , now , wait a minute . Wait just a gawdammm minnit ! How'n hell would he know if it ai n't mine or not ? How could he know ? How would a broken-down , shiftless of nigger know what I own ? How could he know ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't been a gawdamn place outside'a Red Springs ' cept for th ' time when Priminger found him hidin ' outside'a Rennert  --  or wherever th ' hell he was . An ' ? an ' he was too gawdamn dumb to leave th ' plantation when the others left , an ' ai n't nobody been back to see ' im , includin ' that big black tub o'lard Elsie whatsername ; and it 's for sure that Silas an ' them do n't know a damn thing  --  an ' even if they did , they wouldn ' tell that black bastard ! I must be out of my cotton-pickin ' mind to listen to that fool ! " It was as if a Greek tragedy was at work : " Fool , are you out'ta your mind ? " " No . " " Admit you 're tellin ' a gawdamn lie !

" " That was some mighty good eatin ' , Unca Benny , " Moses said , winding up the meal and sending quick , satisfying pats on a protruding belly that reminded one of a tiny cantaloupe . Ben smiled and tossed an after dinner wad of tobacco in his mouth . " Y'say that every night we gits a chance t'eat . " " Yeah , but you said t'night was special . " " Well , it is. "  | " Is it a special day for Mr. Archy , too ? " " In a way . " The boy thought about it , and persisted . " What makes it so spe-cial ? " " O000h , lotta things . " " Lotta things , like what ? " Hoping to avoid more questions , Ben got up and took the tins to the tub and harmlessly splashed about a thimbleful of water on them , wiped them , and moved to the shelf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like what ? " " Ca n't we say just a lotta things , an ' let it go at that ? " " N0000 . An ' you allus said , if you wan na know somethin ' , jus ' ask . I 'm askin ' . " " Ummhum . But there 's a lotta things a little fella like you ai n't s ' pose to know . " " Like what ? " " See , there you go again . " " Then why 'd you tell me to ask ? " " ' Cause , y'spose t'know things " But how can I know things if you ai n't answerin ' no questions ? " " You ai n't asked th ' right ones yet . " " Okay , I got'a right one . " " Shoot " " Tell me what you know . " Ben sagged " Good heaven , boy , I do n't know what I 'm gon na do with you " And then he thought about it . " Course , I do n't know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him , shaking his head . " Questions , questions , questions . C'm on , son . Bedtime . " After the initial resistance , the boy always found something intriguing about sliding under the quilt and entering another world . Every night , after undressing and slipping on a pair of undies that rivaled a dark cloud for color , he would back off for a running start and pounce on the bed and reacquaint himself with the burlap that served as both mattress and sheet . There would be no prayers , appeal , tribute , or silent acknowledg-  | ment of a Superior Being . But had Sweet Elsie Pratt lived , there would have been , and the comforts of religion would have occupied both his days and nights . The big woman would have told him , and he would have understood , the unending mercy of God , the Father . She would have spoken of all His children , and of the big book  --  the book with pages she could not read but nevertheless understood through the inexplicable miracles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken of a creation so stupendous in magnificence that man would always stand in awe and would forever be unknowing of its fullness . She would have spoken of Adam and Eve , and of Cain and Abel , and of good and evil . She would have taken him back to the Garden of Eden and likened the actions of the serpent to that of the slaver . She would have spoken glowingly of Mary and Joseph , and of the Wise Men , and of days unknown to him  --  Christmas and Easter , events so Monumental they would forever touch the hearts of all right-thinking people , and would forever change the course of history . From the Book of Genesis to Reve-lations  --  the beginning and the end , she would have recounted untold numbers of trials and tribulations ; triumphs and defeats . She would have indelibly implanted on his young mind the great legends of the big book  --  from the forgivable wanderings of the Prodigal Son to the adventures of Shadrack , Meshack , and Abendego . She would have gone from the prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zion , and to the seas . From the everlasting power and wisdom of the Ten Commandments to the outright dread of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse , and she would have spoken of these things in her own special way . The big black woman with the roaring voice and glistening skin would have talked of the many tribes  --  the Assyrians , the Babylonians , the Canaanites , the Hittites , and of all the people , from the Jews to the Samaritans , she would have spoken of the Apostles , of Andrew , James , Jude , Peter , and Simon , and time and time again she would have retraced the steps of the favored Matthew , Mark , Luke , and John , and she would have constantly reminded him of his namesake , Moses , and what he was to the world  --  and what he could become . It would have delighted him to no end , and he would have promised her that he would be as she wanted him to be . She would have talked  | on wisely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it , us he , would not always be understood , but that if hurt , he was to continue , and be afraid of no man  --  for try as he will , the true power was not within him , but rather above him . She would have said , be not afraid to turn the other cheek , and if harm was done to that cheek , be not afraid to cry , for the greatest of all men cried . Cry in pity , she would have said , and cry in forgiveness of the man that wronged him , and then cry again in toleration of the indignities . She would have said , dry your eyes  --  dry them in preparation , for the time was coming when they as a people would rise up and mightily smite those that had oppressed them . Prepare , she would have said . Prepare , because even though they were the oppressed people , they were no less than anyone , and , in an unheralded way , they were the favored . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and although they had not been nailed to the cross , they had been beaten , stoned , tarred , feathered , and denied  --  and without benefit of palms at their feet or wreaths on their heads , they had been lynched by the thousands and with God as a witness they would always suffer at the hands of a misguided breed of man . Though created in His image , they have violated His trust , and would forever be devoid of decency , blinded by the light of His texture , cursed by the notion of superiority , and unknowingly reduced to the level of a dunce . But there was no Sweet Elsie Pratt for the child Moses . There was only his uncle Benny , and so the typical good nights for the eager young mind centered on the next day 's activity , which , of course , would change little . That was good , and it was comforting to have another glimpse of the uncle before meeting the people , places , and things that lived beneath the quilt . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer nights sang with the heaviest of humidity , the cover would remain  --  and thus the friends of the world beneath . Ben came in for the last-minute check and was immediately hit with the question : " Say , Unca Benny " ? the boy frowned in thought , reassessing the day ? " where 's Mr. Archy gon na sleep t'night ? " " Ai n't so much as where he 's gon na sleep t'night that bother 's me , "  | Ben said , tucking him in . " It 's where he 's gon na sleep t'morra night . " " He can sleep in town ? " " Do n't think Mr. J. D. an ' them 'll go along with that " " Y'think he 's gon na ? " " Awp  --  that 's ' nuff questions . Too much on y'mind will make you have bad dreams . " " But I do n't never have no bad dreams . " " That 's ' cause you ai n't got much on y'mind . " " Well , I 'll shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think it 's so hot not havin ' anythin ' on y'mind . " " It 'll come , son . It 'll come " Satisfied , the boy slipped way down . Ben lowered the lamp , knowing that the fuel would n't last much longer than ten to twenty minutes . He also knew the boy would have at least one more question . He did . Buried under the cover , he probed : " Wha'cha think Mr. Archy got on his mind ? " " If I was him , I 'd have you on my mind . " The head shot up : " Mr. Archy 's thinkin ' bout me ? " " Ummhum " " Really ? " " He 's got to be thinkin ' about you , son . " The youngster smiled with an inner glow , thinking : Well , I 'll be ! Imagine that ! Mr. Archy 's got ta be thinkin " bout me ! " Hottt zigggiddy ! " Ben looked at the curled figure under the cover , thought about him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " came the voice from down under . " Did you really mean it when you said I was a Mist'r ? " " Ummhuh , " Ben said generously and quietly . " An ' you 're the best Mist'r I ever did see . " No finer words could have ever been spoken . " Hotttzigggiddy ! " Just wait m'friends hears ' bout this . Mr. Moses is a Mist'r ! Whoooo-weeee ! " Hootttzzzigggidy !  | As in the case of Mr. Archy  --  which was about the only thing they had in common  --  the old Red Springers never cared much for the advent of night . This was particularly true of Silas and his stoop-sitting bunch . They did n't care for darkness simply because of the ageold condition of not being able to see anything  --  and seeing was always a part of a true stoop-sitter 's diet . Of course , and to repeat , there was not that much to see  --  even in the light of the midday sun all they were able to digest were the exact same sights they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMillan , as a storekeep , should have lined the more strategic areas with lanterns  --  strategic meaning lining the entire Red Springs road in the hope something commentable would show up . Silas advanced the idea because he had heard that 's what they did in big cities . McMillan politely rebuffed Silas 's notion with the suggestion that he would do just as well by setting fire to the match that he used to unwax his ears and pick at his few remaining teeth . The offer , of course , led to another yearly round of arguments with Silas always threatening to burn down the store and take his business elsewhere . The fact that Red Springs had no other store did n't seem to trouble him , though even if there had been another store , any management worth his salt would n't have tolerated him or his paying record . Silas was a nonpayer from ' way back . McMillan could n't remem-129  | ber the day he had ever seen him with money  --  other than the time he cleaned out Cruddup . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old regs  --  none of them had anything , and in contradiction to circulated yarns , not all of them had been farmers or slavers , but they claimed it . It just was n't true . Only Tonic , the quiet and suspected halfbreed , and Okra had been farmers in the group , and only the late-arrived canehobbler and storekeeper McMillan were actual slaveholders ; the rest of them simply could not afford the luxury , and even if the market price in Fayetteville for slaves had slumped all the way down to three cents a body , Silas and J. D. and all the rest of them could n't have purchased one under any circumstances . Individually and/or collectively , they could n't have bought a slave if the rate of exchange had been the proverbial pot . They could n't buy time , and yet , to listen to Silas , one would have assumed that he had had a whole plantation of bondaged humanity . Not to stretch the point , but Silas was poorer than a freed slave . Angling for a loan with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put his house up for collateral . The ex-slave took one look , declined , and kept on running , fortunately . Silas never had legal title to the six logs and a piece of canvas anyway . But like J. D. , he was never much of a homesteader , and only in the early days did they both enjoy back-toback shacks that measured only a few feet longer than an outhouse . Of the group , only Cruddup , the big oaf that died in the name of ignorance , had a place worthy of mention , and that was only because of an inheritance . But be damned if he did n't let the place burn to the ground one drunken summer night . In fairness to his memory , though , the occasion was not entirely his fault  --  thanks to the agile mind of the bony Mr. Silas Crookashank . The incident occurred somewhat in the following manner : Cruddup , the dumber one , came to Red Springs from the neighboring little hamlet of Lumberton . In Lumberton , word had reached him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on her last legs , and since he was the sole survivor , it might be a fairly warm idea for him to come and give final aid and comfort to the kind old lady who melted and sighed even at the name of her " beebee in Lumm'tum . " But when the big " beebee " came , he did not give comfort to the old  | lady ; instead , he spent all of his time around the front of the store , trying to establish friendship with the irrepressible Silas . But Silas would n't give the stranger the time of day ; could n't stand him . Hated the big , dumb ox . Would n't even allow him around the pickle barrel . And so the outsider 's days were spent dawdling around the outer edges of the stoop without anyone even bothering to learn his name . Finally , Granny received the call from the Great Beyond ; but before leaving , her feeble old hands saw to it that the " beebee from I umm'tum " was taken care of . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest place in Red Springs , and it was not too far from the storefront . That was a great convenience because Bobby Jo Buggs , another coot of questionable repute and even less intellect , had taken it upon himself to act as town crier in such matters . Bobby Jo 's brain was as about as stable as a teacup on the Mississippi . One sunny morning , while fitting himself with a pilgrimlike hat , he got the bright idea that he would combine poetry with town crying just what Red Springs needed . When someone became sick , he 'd grab pencil and paper ; if they were really sick , he 'd start collecting data ; if they were on their last legs , he 'd start writing . If they recovered , he 'd start cussin ' . When Granny 's great call came , though , he dutifully dusted off the hat , put on some leggings , grabbed a cowbell , and paraded to the storefront . On that low-overhanging day he stood in front , mournfully intoning : " Anothern 's gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rapp is He'ven boun ' ; But her house r'mains on th ' ground . Whose it is now is news to me ? ' Cause h'its in th ' name ? of a beebee . " While " beebee " Cruddup remained aloof over at his section of the stoop , the others were leaning forward in hopeful attentiveness , for the passing of property was the major event in Red Springs and at no time was a single word to be missed . Fading minds did strange things ,  | and one never knew who left what to whom . The cowbell kept working . " Gawddangit , Bobby Jo ! " Silas fumed , voicing everyone 's thoughts . " Ca n't you stand out yonder an ' give me more infa'mation than that ? " Bobby Jo sang : " Anothern 's gone .... An'a house is pass 'd on . " " Gawddanggit , Bobby Jo ! What'n th ' blazes is you talkin " bout ? A beebee ! What'n hell 's that  --  You see any dam 'd beebee 's ' round here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Who got th ' pr'perty , y'ignant cuss ! " " Find th ' beebee An ' you will seeee Who is got ? The prop-pit'teeee . " " Bobby Jo Buggs ! Y'gawdamn sot ! " " Anothern ' s gone . . . . An ' a house ... " Away went the town crier . But who  --  and what  --  was " th ' lil ' beebee ? " While others went off to ponder the unknown entity , Silas remained on the stoop , digging his toes in the pickles , and fighting hard for the answer . It was even more difficult because Cruddup , unmoved from his position at the far edge of the stoop , was there with his long , dragging face , and annoyingly hampered Silas 's serious thinking . When Silas tried to drive him off , Cruddup brushed away a tear , " I 'm leavin ' anyhow . I 'm goin ' t'see my granny . I been here all this time an ' I ai n't even see 'd her once " " Well , hurrup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " B'fore she kicks th ' bucket . " Cruddup stood and brushed away another tear . " I used t'be her lil ' bay-beee . " " What ? "  | Cruddup went on to reveal the story , and by the time he had finished , Silas had his arms draped around the big man 's neck and both his feet soaking in the pickle barrel . Now they were the best of friends . " Good , good buddies . " Glue . Inseparable . It fell to Good Buddy Silas to protect Good , Good , Buddy Cruddup from the evils of others . Granny Rapp 's house was a museum of antiquity . The word mausoleum would have worked as well , but in deference to Granny and her rat-packing , pipe-smoking ways , one favored the less heavier of the two . Her house , large by any standard , was one of the first built in Red Springs , and everything the workers left was still there . Sawed-off planks of lumber , discarded nails , tar , and so on had found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , passed on from a father who spent considerable time in Europe claiming that he was a collector while all the while being a master at the slave trade . The Red Springers knew of Granny 's eccen-tricities  --  meaning she was apt to have anything , so when Good Buddy Silas led Good , Good Buddy Cruddup over to the place , he made sure they were dragging sacks behind them . Needless to say , neither of them knew the value of art ; neither of them had ever seen art . Good Buddy Silas looked at the collection and said Granny must have been pretty handy with crayons , and they both started filling the sacks , Good Buddy Silas at one end , and Good , Good Buddy Cruddup at the other . In the process , Good , Good Buddy Cruddup asked what the plan of action was going to be . Good Buddy Silas told him that it would be a pretty good idea to take everything movable over to his house , come back , and : " Sell ! " " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , Good , Good Buddy , we gon na have a gran ' openin'I " " Good thinkin ' , Good Buddy . How we gon na do that ? " " Tell somebody , Good , Good Buddy . " " Good thinkin ' , Good , Buddy  --  how we gon na do that ? " " If it 's gon na be gran ' ? you got ta tell ' em gran ' , Good , Good Buddy . " " Good thinkin ' , Good Buddy . Wha'sit gon na take ? "  | " Whas that in y'right pocket ? " " Oh , jus ' some money . " " Toss it in m'sack . Got ta take it home . Got ta inspect it . " " Anythin ' else ? " " Whas that in y'left ?

" " Jus ' th ' kitchen " " Th ' bigger the  --  hold it ! ? thas where we can put th ' still ! " " Good thinkin ' , Good , Good Buddy . " Good Buddy Silas was so enamored with the idea of having a still  | in the kitchen , he took the two sacks , pawned them off , got drunk , and returned to the house two days later , lugging two fun-size jugs under one arm and an apple-mouthed pig under the other . Tagging behind him , equally drunk , and carrying equipment for making the still was Good , Good Buddy Cruddup . " What we gon na do with th ' pig ?

" The house burned for three hours and twelve minutes .  | Fayetteville , North Carolina , the onetime state capital ( 1789-1793 ) , seat of Cumberland County , fifty miles south-southwest of Raleigh . Founded by the Scots , named for a Frenchman , and occupied by Sherman . Benefactress of the Cape Fear River ; scented by magnolias , spotted with azaleas , and flavored by a mirage of exquisitely dappled sunrises . Changed now , but exciting were the early days of the big meets . Under a roving carnivallike atmosphere , the curious mingled with the serious and the serious mixed with the shoppers and became lost behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eager-eyed youngsters flitted around them and gathered innocently at the far end of the street , plotted their course , grinned mischievously , and hopped merrily alongside surreys , carriages , and carts that cluttered Hays , Gillespie , Green , and Person streets . At the big circular intersection they would slip across to the big-bannered Fayetteville Market House  --  site of where the action would take place . Quickly , they would post a lookout and duck around to the rear and steal sniggling glimpses of the chained and squatted merchandise . Confirmed , the children would skip off to find rocks and other items suitable for throwing . They would return and the fun would start . Dallying music swelled from the park , and amid the bowing , scraping , and dainty amenities of the day strolled buyers , who , flushed with the sense of gentlemanly astuteness and newfound importance ,  | order the captain exacted swift and brutal punishment . The crew of thirty-five men and six officers hanged forty-six men and one woman . They were shot at , mutilated , " made sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for at sea barbarity was not held by the American slaveship Kentucky . That distinction belonged to the English . In September of 1781 the master of the Zong threw 136 slaves overboard . It was not done because of a community . Captain Luke Coilingwood did it to collect the insurance . Aboard the Brookes and other slave ships , with two and a half feet allowed for head room , the slaves were made to lie in the spoon position , naked , on hard boards , and with the left wrist and ankle shackle of one person , shackeled to the right wrist and ankle of another . From the mouth of the river Congo , the journey to the Americas was expected to last for six weeks , but it sometimes stretched into three months , and very often when the ships reached port , any number of the cargo had been lost . " Disobedience , " claimed many . Illness claimed more . Some were driven mad by the conditions and by lying helplessly in the belly of the ship and hearing nothing but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling and pounding of the sea itself . Others , for no other reason than being paralyzed by the loss of freedom , thought of suicide . Those that sought to carry out the final hope found it virtually impossible to do so because of the shackles and more often than not by the inability to even sit upright . They were left with the lone act of self-starvation . When the condition was noticed , and making certain that it was not a normal case of seasickness helped by ground corn , molasses , and rice , or other foods the blacks were not accustomed to , the crew would spring into immediate action . Motivated by the fear of economic loss , they would first try to beat the offenders into opening their mouths with the cat o ' nine tails . Failing in that , the crew would get a bucketful of piping hot coals from the galley and push the recalcitrant head and lips either directly into the scorching bucket or on its side . Sometimes the purpose would be defeated entirely . With the chains conducting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , or the cheeks would be cooked to the bucket .  | With no medicine aboard , all would be lost . Along with the hot coal method , another system was used . It was called the speculum oris . That method required forging a flattened metal device between the teeth to force the mouth open , thus food could be funneled down the throat . A thumbscrew was used at the same time . It was to divert the pain . In the long run neither method proved sucessful and , as matters ended up , if it did n't appear that the self-starving slave would have a change of attitude or that he was unlikely to last the journey , he , or she , was released from the shackles and removed from below deck . He was simply thrown overboard . But the troubles aboard the ship were of no concern to the auctioneer . The slaves had made it to the New Land . From Angola to the little kraal on the other side of the Zambezi they came . And now they were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale in an English-inspired structure so unique that it stole the thunder of a courthouse and became the focal point of a city . Built in 1832 , replacing the old State House where forty-three years earlier the state of North Carolina ratified the Constitution of the United States and where , too , she chartered a university and generously ceded her western lands to form the state of Tennessee , the Market House was an architectural wonder . Flanked by two beautiful second-story white balconies , it was made of pink brick , laid in Flemish bond . The entranceways and windows were cathedrally arched and pine pillars elevated eyes to the second floor , where a large , Boston-made Howard clock chimed at mealtimes and fell in line with a melodious bell that rang from the cupola . Sometimes , on a slow day , there were not just all slaves on sale at the Market House : REAL ESTATE AND NEGROES AND FURNITURE AT AUC-TION  --  At the Market House on Thursday the 22nd inst . I shall sell at auction a house and lot situated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands of Mr. James Kyle ; 42 1/2 acres of the land 3 1/2 miles north of the town of Fayetteville on the Raleigh Plank Road opposite Mr. C. P. Mallett 's , adjoining  | W. B. Wright , Esq . One negro ( sic ) woman , 25 years of age and child three years old . A lot of furniture among which is one piano , one extention dining table , bedsteads , chairs , and so on , and one excellent milk cow . ? January 9 , 1863 . John H. Cool , Auctioneer . And sometimes there were still fewer : NEGROES FOR SALE  --  I will expose to sale on Tuesday , the 10th day of November at the Market House in the town of Fayetteville at 12 o'clock P. M. four negro slaves belonging to the estate of the late James A. Byrne , a decree of the County Court has been obtained at September term for the sale of said slaves in order to effect a division . ? October 21 , 1863 . J. T. Warden , Commissioner . But on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they were called , the site bristled with activity , but no one could do more than keep an eye on the auctioneer . He was a proud man . Usually well traveled , he considered himself a true artisan , a master of the trade . It was his feeling that no one knew the market better than he , and he was quick to leave the impression that no statistic avoided his uncanny mind and eye . He could name dates , titles , and places , and without being pressed , and no doubt generated from his own imagination , he could recount tale after tale of the white man 's heroics in capture , and he would expertly lead an enraptured audience from the wilds of Africa to the stormy ports of the Americas . The auctioneer was essential to the South ; and in some cases , he was the South , and to his way of thinking , he was that galvanizing link between man and beast ; he was au courant  --  transient light of the Dark Continent . The auctioneer knew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly sought , and sometimes he would come into town and cases of whiskey and stuffed envelopes would be at the waiting ; and better still , the telltale hankies and pungent perfume of the late-night female callers would leave him with amply more than mere good wishes .  | At the start of the auction , particularly if it was held out front and in view of the coy eyes of fanning belles , the glib auctioneer would meander through the crowd , spilling quick bon mots about slaves as a people , and the looks and ways of the savages that remained in the jungle . His dialogue and their habits would leave the audience laughing in enriched smugness . Banter would take the good sport back to the platform . With everyone uplifted , he would call for the start of the parade . Quickly the handlers would race off , and in an instant the first line of bodies would be led from a barren warehouselike structure across the street to the beauty of the Market House  --  and there they would stand , frozen in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrender . The master of the trade would not let dejection take hold . Almost like a lion tamer , but with the artistry of a badinaging salesman , he would lead the slaves around the platform , and by the time he had completed the second circle , everyone was convinced that dejection and misery was but the better of obedience . If the first group of slaves appeared strong and virile and had those big backs that could hump the fields and stir the soil with animallike stamina  --  and if they had that added touch of moping docility  --  the audience would applaud enthusiastically , a clear signal that it had been a good catch , and that the traders and the plains of Africa had not run dry . The applause also meant that any and all troublesome stateside slaves could now be dealt with properly and without endangering progress . In the matter of the children clinging to their elders , or the old holding firm to the young , or in the case of entire families holding on to one another with such intensity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slithering off fingertips , there was noth-ing  --  no sympathy , no commiseration or pity for the ones from the jungle . There was nothing , either , for those that red-eyed each other in the deep and merciful hope of staying together in a land with strange customs , which spewed a language they did not understand . There was nothing except the cold , hard fact that the hope of one species did not affect the will of the other , and all he , the latter , had to do was to  | simply nod  --  and the auctioneer knew : Mr. Suchnsuch will take that , or it , or them . Without that additional tilt of the head , the auctioneer knew that Mr. Suchnsuch did not want them . He will take that  --  and that alone , and obligingly , that would be ushered aside  --  and whether it was man , woman , or child , the threat of the backstage bullwhip hung high , and anything the whip could n't handle , the butt  --  or sometimes the muzzle  --  of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few in those days , and the North 's belated , selfrighteous unwillingness to accept slavery for what it was would be cleverly shot down by a new thing called the American Colonization Society . To be organized in Washington , D.C. , by Robert Finley , the Presbyterian minister from New Jersey , and encouraged by President James Madison and Senator Henry Clay , and other influential leaders , the society would create and provide a homeland for the free blacks . Land would be purchased in Africa . An African state of Maryland on Cape Palmas would be founded , and the colony would become Liberia . In 1822 the dream came true ; but the first group of settlers , totaling 114 , was almost destroyed by disease . Other organizations were to follow the society , but they , too , would fail . Mr. Archy , as well as others , did n't know this , and it is doubted they would have cared . The abolitionists and insurrectionists never received serious Fayetteville talk . The abolitionists , it was felt , did n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the flag-waving rhetoric was nothing more than bloated talk and thinly veiled efforts to cover their own guilt-ridden inadequacies , as their true feelings did n't run any deeper than a duck walking on water . " Take the downtrodden beast of a man , " it was argued , " and put him in the comforts of the abolitionist 's bed , and then see who would want to banish what " The insurrectionists felt , too , that the abolitionists were far too errant , disorganized , and insignificant to create harm , and even if not , the South had organizations that would eventually blast them back into obscurity . Before the Civil War , along with the Brookes , there was another incident that created somewhat of a stir in Fayetteville , and that was TELL ME A TALE 145  | the case of the schooner L'Amistad wherein the slave hunters had captured a group of Sierra Leone natives and headed them for Spain . But four days out at sea , and led by their young chief , the natives arose , killed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whites to surrender . Cinque and his men had hoped to return to Africa , but the vessel mistakenly ended up in New York 's Long Island harbor , where they were promptly arrested and jailed . Because of international implications and the outright boldness of Cinque 's act , an act that could have fired every slave in the nation into rebellious conduct , the slave owners became concerned and hoped that the United States would dispose of the matter quietly . But the case proved to be much too complicated . Several court cases ensued , but thanks to John Quincy Adams , the former President , who at a weakened and almost blind age of seventy-three , later argued the case before the Supreme Court , and who had previously introduced resolutions into the House of Representatives directing President Van Buren , a southern sympathizer , to report to Congress the authority by which the Africans were held , the United States admitted lack of jurisdiction . On March 9 , 1841 , a landmark decision was handed down : The Africans were illegally held and therefore were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were returned to Africa . Accompanying them was a group of breast-beating , Bible-toting missionaries . They would show the Africans the proper way to live in the jungle . Long before the L'Armistad incident , however  --  starting with the period right after the turn of the century  --  gradual changes began to take place in Fayetteville . Some of the glitter of the slave trade became commonplace , and the artful auctioneer no longer enjoyed celebrated status . As with the carnival atmosphere , his star dimmed and eventually gave out , and , as it was said by some , so had the quality of the slaves  --  although it was not the slave quality that spelled the end of one of Fayetteville 's better-known practices . Oddly enough , that distinction belonged to Mrs. McBride , Mr. Archy 's imperious but dippy wife . On her second visit to market , the first having led to the second marriage , she had stood and criticized the notion of applauding . " Are  | we sick ? " she charged , startling everyone by doing the most unladylike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the jungle , and yet we 're applauding them ? I have never heard of such a thing , clapping for a man from the jungle ! Nowhere  --  nowhere on the face of the earth is that done ! It is preposterous ! We are white people ! White people ! The superior does not applaud the inferior ! " And just like that , she charged away , leaving mouths ajar . Mildred McBride , nee Byrd , daughter of Carruth C. , was an unconventional sort , so unconventional that her sanity had always been in doubt . It came into further question when days after the death of her first husband , 011ie Priminger , she married young Archibald McBride , at the time a handsome but poverty-stricken escapee from the back roads of Mt . Mitchell , high point of North Carolina 's Appalachian Mountains . Two things set up the marriage : her wealth and his designs . Archy McBride , then a slender and sandy-haired Scot whose father had jumped ship , gotten lost , found a house , claimed squatters ' rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , was about thirteen years younger than his salty-faced wife . His job at the time was to prepare the slaves for delivery  --  and there the duty was supposed to end . But the wealthy lady from Red Springs caught his dollar-signed eye on that first-time visit ; he delivered the slaves she had purchased after saying more than once she would no longer be a holder of slaves and that she would get rid of those left to her charge . She was there to receive the slaves and the young Scot . Four days later , the honey-tongued Appalachian had acquired a wife and a plantation load of slaves .  | The road from Red Springs to the city where it all began , and a city Archibald McBride had n't seen in years , was hard and long and treated the plantation owner from Red Springs with telling disrespect . Insects , bumps , and lack of sleep united with the pitch-black night and tried to stop him , but it was those strong , reverberating words that pushed him on : " Go to Fayetteville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . She lived up to her name . Majestically , as though a host of chariots should have heralded the approach , she came gowned in the dust of a spreading mist and slunk with the grace and intimacy of an unhurried seductress . Sure , coy , she slithered forward  --  slowly  --  and made it appear as if the universe would benefit from low-lined cushions of haze . Softly , like an enchantress , she toyed with the dew and sent her long , elegant fingers weaving through the stillness and set sight on the only thing that dared interrupt the calm . Without anger , though , she sighed , dipped her graciousness closer , and there caressed the head of the straight-eyed old man who loosely held the reins and directed the crunching wagon on its course . It was a stubborn and cantankerous old head , and though persuasively touched , it would not surrender completely . Though slowed , the wagon creaked on . Unworried , dawn swayed and jested with the foliage and then , with something on her mind , she went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The mule was not the subject , but he was first to feel the effect . He stopped , and after a moment or two he yawned himself to sleep . Unwillingly , the  | head aboard the wagon followed suit . It tilted back and over , and for a time looked as if it would lead the body tumbling down to the ground . Confoundingly , it struggled back and fought to remain upright . Dawn was undaunted . She smiled , and taking her own sweet time , she disrobed completely . Like the seductress that she was , she slinked her everything on top of him . And he was deep in the dungeons of sleep . She looked at him , smiled , and rolled over . She waited for a moment more , and then she arose , and without doing anything more , she pranced away . The hot rays of noon , she knew , would not be so kind . Dawn was right . Noon came resentfully and tried to singe the man to a crisp . The sun had so baldly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in Fayetteville , his mind was still in a state of siege . It was hours before full orientation came  --  and the changes in Fayetteville were of no help . The textile and lumber mills were still scattered about , but there were no signs of the big , smoke-billowing silos that reached for the skies as he had imagined . There were still many cotton houses , but it was the tobacco houses that established prominence . Fayetteville was now a leader in industry , and the unlimited stretch of new and revamped and strongly odored buildings attested to the fact that it was the industry of the future . Workers , wagons , and scales were everywhere , and it was for certain that everyone was gearing up for the arrival of the new cigarette-making machinery . It was said that the new invention could cut , sort , sift , roll , recut , reroll , resort paper , print , and trim a whole cigarette without being touched by human hands . Tobacco could even be boxed and shipped to loading platforms without human guidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were due . The new industry was not , however , the concern of the troubled man from Red Springs . He had memories and he would not allow himself to go through the center of the city . It was not a wise decision . He had forgotten or was still too disoriented to remember that the road he often took to get to the now-old Market House was sprinkled with a group of old-timers representing the low end of the city .  | Usually there would be a dozen or so , but the ranks had thinned and today there would be only a sextet who squarely reminded one of the Red Springers . On this day there was Epps , Wills , Bud , and Austin , and one other old head who never said anything to anyone and stood leaning against a post staring longingly at the nearby intersection as if trying to look the new tobacco machine into being . The five or six old saws spent their days idling up on the stoop and underneath a warehouse sign that inappropriately announced WE BUYS AND SELLS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stringbean of a man with a protruding belly , and a Silas counterpart , had found enough energy to paint the sign , and had never gotten over the artistry . He was always first to arrive at the stoop and last to leave . Going or coming , he would always acknowledge the great work with a beaming wave of the hand . He even suggested covering it up at night . " I like it , " he said that day , and as he had said every day for the past eight years . " Y'like it , Mr. Epps ? " Epps , the proprietor of the drab , bone-empty building , had never liked the sign , had never commissioned it , and never paid for it . His everyday response to Wills was to look up and say : " High art . " Wills would beam even brighter . It was a magnificent compliment . What Wills did not know was that Epps was not really talking to him . The story goes that Epps , a man of short sentences , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . His name was Arthur . Friends called him Art for short . When the father died , Epps , realizing the errors of his ways , promised himself that he would speak to his father every day . Thus .. . The conversation among the men  --  and indeed the city of Fay-etteville  --  was always about the impending arrival of the machines . Not a store , not a shop , not a place , not a person , not a thing , could escape the daily talk . The stoopites were typical , though they did n't have as much to gain as in the case of many of the others . Needless to say , they were not  | farm or land owners , nor were they the big moneymen , but they did have a modest stake in what was to be . Their conversations usually started about an hour after sunrise and would conclude at dusk . Wills , since he was first to arrive in order that he could check on his sign , would often start by inquiring  --  as if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , hinting and hoping they would arrive unpainted . If they did , he wanted the franchise . If they did not , he wanted the franchise . His argument was that Fayetteville had its own color scheme , and no city northerner should ever paint for the South . Bud would counter the argument by saying that the machines were coming because of industry , and the color did n't make a damned bit of difference . Austin would follow by quite rightly pointing out that people chewed tobacco , not paint . And then it would start . They would argue for hours . The only time they would stop and collectively come together was when they would see a person of negro descent , usually strutting with jaunty independence , crossing the street to the nearby meat market . The blacks were generously friendly and could be counted on to toss an eye up on the stoop , give a cheery wave along with a musical " how-de-do , " and keep on strutting . Somebody in the group could always be counted on to deliver an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who said the color of the machines did n't make any difference . " Do n't be how'doin ' me , y'thief . " That was typical . The man was not a thief . Bud did n't even know him . " Why you want to call him a thief ? " " Had to call him somethin ' . " " Why ? " A question  --  or position  --  which would start another argument . There were mixed emotions about freed blacks in Fayetteville . The bounteous city with the bright future did n't know whether to encourage or discourage , whether to open arms or close doors , whether to move for or to stand against . The one thing it promised itself it would not do , it did n't . It did not stand still . When Mr. Archy finally rolled in that morning , he caught the  | Fayettevillans by surprise . They had n't seen him in years . They still would n't like him , and what had caused them to dislike him so much was that the poor Appalachian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate , after coming into wealth . Jealousy no doubt played a large part of it , after all , the country widow , while painfully hurt in the looks department , was a prize catch  --  financially speaking . It was said Archy used underhanded tactics to get her and the slaves . In a sense he did . In the case of Mildred , the tactic was obvious , and was as old as sin . In the matter of the slaves , he was more inventive . Knowing that a slave sale depended on a slave 's appearance , Archy , an ambitious and very fine groomer at the time , would go down to the pier at night , sneak aboard the anchored slave ship , go to the galley , and steal all the flour he could carry . He would then make a mixture and take it to the hole and dust the more virile and promising-looking slaves with the concoction . In the morning when they came down the gangplank , it would look as if they had a skin disease . Young Archy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty good groomer , he had an intuitive and uncanny knowledge of the slave physique , and , when he wanted to , he 'd make it work for him . There were times when , working legitimately for the market , he 'd use that knowledge to advise , give tips , and generally do things favoring the house . Often , in using that uncanny ability , he 'd be at the gangplank before anybody else , sizing up the merchandise when they made those first few steps downward . Several times he was offered a job as a trader , but he declined , saying  --  doubtfully  --  that seasickness was a problem . " What th ' hell brings you back to Fayetteville , McBride ? " " An ' in a wagon . Sure ca n't be lookin ' for slaves ? " The man on the wagon thought it best to seek information elsewhere . But he did n't know where else to go , and he was in a hurry , and he was bone-aching tired . " Th ' County House  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " They knew something was up . " Righ ' next to that buildin ' where we used to have th ' auctions "  | " Next to where you used to control th ' auctions , " said Austin . He left without comment . But he did n't get far before turning to look over his shoulder  --  and sure enough , he could see two or three of them following . His presence alone would provide enough gossip to last through winter . The building Mr. Archy was looking for was a small but beautiful structure , winged in a deep parklike setting . Off to the left , and as though guarding the pure , natural wood of the door , was a somewhat imposing statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee . The pigeons had n't been kind to the shoulders or face , but it was still an impressive piece of work . Looking north , and respectfully away from the general , was another monument  --  a big cement pedestal with rows of chains hanging down from a series of iron posts , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of slavery . Inside , the building was exceptionally clean , and spotted behind the big counter was an efficient , young , balding talker by the name of Warren . When he could get a word in , and when the clerk was n't constantly interrupting about how exceptionally loving and seductive the early morning had been , and that he hoped the same would be true when the new machines arrived , Mr. Archy introduced himself , and after suffering another barrage from the clerk , explained what he was looking for . Warren talked himself through several logs and files but could not come up with the name . There was no " Archibald " McBride . McBrides , yes . But no " Archibald " McBride . The plantation owner was concerned , but not overly fazed . Try " Mildred McBride . " The clerk did as suggested . Double checking , there was no " Mildred " listed . But the clerk quickly rectified the mistake : " No wonder . You said Red Springs . I 'm looking in the Fayetteville files , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get many requests from that part of the country . S'matter of fact , do n't think I ever had one from Red Springs . " Now there was no reason to worry . Mr. Archy 's records were there  --  everything was in order . For a moment his mind wondered about the tobacco industry . Should he commit to it ? He took a  | glimpse out of the window to see what the spying trio was up to . Epps and the sign painter were the culprits . They made little attempt to duck , and simply stayed across the street , staring . Mr. Archy , as he had been throughout , was surprisingly calm . He withdrew from the window and his mind took a turn and made an involuntary trip back to the early days . Across the street , where the men stood , was where he first laid eyes on Mildred . What an empty-headed , argumentative , suspicious , and spooky old woman she turned out to be , he thought . And that moaning and crying all night . Priminger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three solid years , but by moaning over scented candles Mildred , strange Mildred , had found a way to keep the memory alive , and daily , daily , she would find a way to have it intrude upon their lives . If she thought so much of his memory , why did she become Mrs. McBride so quickly ? Why , in less than four days after they had met , were they married in Lumberton ? She would never answer the question . Even with others she would always avoid questions relating to the marriage . Mr. Archy was inclined to believe that in the long run she married him because he knew how to handle slaves . It was important for her to marry young Archibald McBride because she was a lonely woman in a huge house with nothing but slaves between her and total isolation . And that was terrifying . Most women alone  --  most white women  --  while excellent at putting up a good front , were deathly afraid of slaves . Slaves were too unreadable , sometimes too quiet  --  especially at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crudely imbecilic that they were apt to do anything ? anything in the world . And they would too . They would because they were from the jungle and the fragility and daintiness of whiteness could stir them to beastly heights . And as far as Miss Mildred was concerned , they even looked at their own women menacingly . What if she said something out of the way to them ? Suppose she had reprimanded one of them , night came , and she was alone  --  again . What was she to do ? Whether there was one or a hundred and one , there was just something about a slave and that stinking , ebonized body that got to her  --  as it did with all the women of the South . What could a southern woman do ?  | And the nights  --  oh , those terrible , terrible , god-awful nights ? nights when even the silent movement of the houseboy would send shivers up her spine ; and that Ben  --  that new creature Priminger found . He was the worst . And what about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chants ; singing , they said . They should be ashamed of themselves calling those gruesome sounds singing . It 's too flesh-crawling . Why do they have to do that ? And when Priminger died , the moaning was nonstop . Why ? Priminger had been their captor . He was their slave master . Did n't they know that ? Did n't they know better ? Mourning the man who had virtually chained them up and brought them here ? That was just about as stupid and asinine as the Fayetteville auction applause Priminger used to talk about . She would go to the auction and tell them exactly how she felt . Would she buy a slave ? Under no circumstances . Slaves were too scary for a woman alone . And she 'd get rid of the ones she had ? that 's what she would do . And then the nights would be restful . Silent . Why is a house so silent after death ? Why does a big house creak so much after a body 's been laid out for viewing ? Up North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that . They do n't have you sleeping in one room and the body stretched out in another  --  hanging around for three days and nights . How ghastly . Why is it that the dead do n't take their all with them when they go ? Do n't they know how frightening it is for those who remain to hear them ? They lay there , whispering your name when they 're supposed to be gone , reappearing , ghostlike , inviting you to join them in some forsaken place you 've never heard of . Do n't they know that fear rides with the silence of night  --  for those who are alone ? Why do memories have to hang on ? Why do they taunt so ? Why ca n't they be uprooted ? Why ca n't they be plucked out ? Why ca n't they go away ? Why ca n't they shrivel up and die ? It is ungodly to hang around and taunt the lonely . All living things must die , all from the soil must return to the soil  --  all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just why is memory more privileged than anything else ? Because it 's intangible ? What kind of an excuse is that ? Excuse me . Yes ? Priminger ? I 'll be joining you shortly , dear . Archibald McBride ca n't be trusted .  | " Both death certificates are in order , and , let 's see . . . hummm-double-checking the date of deed transfer ... hummm-hummm  --  and signature . . . prior to death . . . . Oookayyy ; and notary . . . out of Lumberton . . . Yep , it 's all here . S ' all in th ' name of Priminger . " The prematurely balding little clerk had been standing there a full two minutes , talking . Talking to himself , as it turned out . Mr. Archy did not hear him , or so it seemed . It was as if his mind had taken leave at some point before the clerk returned from upstairs , struggling with ledgers , records , logs , maps , all while reading , quoting , and pointing . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all that Warren was saying , he certainly did n't show it . His look contradicted everything one would have thought . He stood there , saying nothing . Even when the clerk tried to poke him into saying something , still he said nothing . It could have been that he had already started a change , and that in thinking of Mildred and that bent state of mind , anything could have been possible . Perhaps not legal , but certainly problematic . But what about the law ? What about the legalities ? Mr. Archy did not grant it full significance at the time , but the very next day  --  after what he thought was a rather strange marriage cere-mony  --  if it could have been called a ceremony in a house without witnesses and with a preacher who did n't use a Bible and who never once asked them to repeat a vow , but on the way back to Red Springs , Mildred brought up the subject of the property , marriage , and the law and pointed out with further untimeliness : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property one does n't own " " One can not dispose of property one does n't own , " he remembered thinking at the time . " One can not dispose of property one does n't own . What th ' hell does that mean ? " He said nothing aloud at the time and never bothered to question it further . At the counter , Warren , the clerk , took it upon himself to reread certain information aloud . On the third reading , not getting a response  | from the previous two , he took it upon himself to reread the entry louder and slower . He was careful to fully enunciate every word . There was a delay , but eventually there was movement . When the man from Red Springs finally brought his eyes back to the counter and up to face the clerk , they could n't stay there . It was like they had been coerced into going back down again to fulfill a promise the head had made , but was not sanctioned by the rest of the body . Again the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the relatively small and dusty cardboard box . Knowing that it was not necessary to perform full duty , the eyes came back up to face the clerk again . Warren said something else , but there was no need . Mr. Archy was gone . For the sake of brevity , Warren had repeated that the described property had to be located by address , as the property was not in the name of Archibald McBride or Mildred McBride . He had told the man from Red Springs  --  as he was later to repeat to the snooping two from across the street , and who were to subsequently get it wrong . " The property in question , " Warren repeated , " had been owned by Mr. and Mrs. 011ie Priminger , both now deceased . Mr. 011ie Priminger preceded Mrs. 011ie Priminger in death . In the intervening period , however , and under notarized signature of mother and widow , said property had been kept in the Priminger name . It had been deeded to one Moses Priminger , heir and only son of Mr. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that intervening period . When it hit , it hit hard . Mr. and Mrs. 011ie Prim ? ? ? What kind of crazed  --  What'n th ' hell ! What kind of convoluted crap ! Mr. and Mrs. 011ie  --  Priminger ? Mildred McBride was Mrs. 011ie Priminger ? An ' Mrs. 011ie Priminger was a widow  --  and the widow Priminger never what ? An ' that little conscious-nagging sunovabitch was who ? Moses Priminger ? Son of Mrs. and Mrs. 011ie Priminger ? Mother ! Mother and widow ? Th ' boy was the son of a man who 's been dead for over twenty years , and couldn ' even get it up when he was alive , was the father of who ? My son ? Archibald McBride 's son ? Th ' hell you say ! What gawdam 'd gall ! It 's gawdamn insanity ! Wicked ! Is th ' world  | done gone plum ' crazy ? What is this ? How unbalanced could a human bein ' get ? If this ai n't th ' gawdamn joke of th ' century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mule puke ! It 's insane ! Madness ! What kind of a sick , distorted , and evil mind could even think of something so gawdam p'verted ? An ' think she could get away with it ? An ' notary ? What kind'a gawdam notary worth his salt would go along with such buffoonery ? Th ' whole thing was sick . Mildred McBride was sick ; a lunatic , depraved . A gawdam 'd sick , depraved lunatic ! Lunacy was not restricted to Mrs. McBride : What are you going to do about the property now , Mr. Archy ? Sorry , could n't hear you , sir . Still could n't hear you , sir . But moving on . . . Your son , you 've just acknowledged him for the first time . Did you know that ? Do you realize you did that , sir ? Ca n't hear you , Mr. Archy . But you 've acknowledged your son . What are you going to do about him ? Mr. Archy ? Mr. Archy , did you want to say something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ?  | That day  --  that ? " marriage " to the widow Priminger did come back again . It hung heavy . It would not have been excessive to use the words almost comatose in describing the condition of the man who had been on the other end of that " marriage " It was a mummified man who now sat aboard the wagon that slowly creaked past the pigeon-stained statues , the monuments , the slave-reminding icons , the stores , the stoop-sitters , and everything else Fayetteville had to offer . Later , on the long road home , he did not see the spot where he had encountered the passion of dawn . There would be no seduction this time . Even had there been an attempt , it would not have penetrated . The former plantation owner was too busy fighting for the return of another visitor : full sanity . Owing to the impaired shape of the mule , his condition , and the hardness of the distance , they plodded along all that evening and all through the night . Mr. Archy did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon of the following day , and when the old shack did appear in the darkened foreground , he did something he had not done during the journey . He stopped the wagon . He stared out at the old place and lowered his head from the trancelike position . He came out of it but , still , it was as if all the pressures of the world had weighted his shoulders . He remained downward for an extremely long while and , finally , as if he could find no answers , he pulled his head up and wearily sighed . He stayed in that position . His eyes went back out to the place . Minutes more , and slowly , lightly , he tugged at the reins  | and the wagon chomped at the remaining distance . If full sanity was returning , he knew , it 'd better hurry . Ben knew that it was about time for Mr. Archy 's return , and so he had positioned himself on the porch , and with Moses at his side , he waited . An hour later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dipping snuff , sipping sassafras tea , and starring out at the broad fields of corn that were before him . The boy did not know the wagon was coming and celebrated another good day by downing the last few gulps of a concocted mash consisting of blackberries , mixed with strawberries , cantaloupe , watermelon , pears , peaches , plums , huckleberries , gooseberries , walnuts , peanuts , and pecans . Nicely sated , he reared back and comfortably arched seeds , pits , cores , shells , shucks , and hulls at the big red ants and the zooming green-backed flies . The world was at peace . When the wagon finally arrived to within earshot , the boy scrambled to his feet and started to bounce out with a greeting . Ben 's tap on the knee kept him in place . Back down he went . Slowly the wagon inched to a stop in front of the porch . There was an acquired silence , with neither of the two men looking directly at each other . Moments passed , and with Ben determined not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the boy , and then looked over at the vast acreage . He was vague and gaunt , and after a time sat there and tried to fish for words . But the words did not come easily , and when they did , unlike the ring of old , they were soft and with that oily mixture of humbleness struggling for strength . " Got anything to eat , Ben ? " Ben sipped easily on the sassafras and said unheavily , " Oooh , I s'pect there 's somethin ' back there worthwhile chewin ' on . " " I can make you summa what I just had , Mr. Archy , " the boy volun-teered . It went unnoticed . He wanted to say nothing more . But the man was starving . " Think you could fix a little somethin ' up for me , Ben ? " " I think you can rustle it up yourself . " Mr. Archy nodded understandingly and relapsed into silence . The  | boy 's eyes darted from one to the other , not having the slightest idea as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Archy had never looked worse and that his uncle Ben , on the other hand , had never rocked so freely in his presence . And then he was truly stunned . " How you doin ' , son ? " the man on the wagon came back . The word son had slipped out , but Mr. Archy did not want a retraction . For the boy , he 'd just heard the other side of the universe . Heaven just called . His ears popped and there was wide-eyed joy . " Me ? " And then he could n't think at all . Ben rescued him : " Well , tell ' im how you been . " " Oh , er  --  fine . I been jus ' fine  --  suh . " Mr. Archy nodded quietly , and continued to look at him , thinking . " Y'look tired , " Ben said , bringing his attention away . " I am , Ben . I am . " " How was things in Fayetteville ? " If Mr. Archy was at all ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back into an unhappy silence . Down went the head again . Mentally he went away again . " Y ' ai nt feelin ' good , Mr. Archy ? " the boy asked as though wanting to help . Mr. Archy said nothing , and as the boy waited for an answer , he moved close to the edge of the porch and started to say something else . Ben quieted him with a polite look . Minutes later , and with his actions grounded down to the slowest of movements , Mr. Archy lifted the reins and prepared to leave . The boy looked quickly at his uncle , who did nothing to try and stop him . If the uncle did n't , he sure would . " Where you goin ' Mr. Archy ? " " Home , " he answered vacantly . " But  --  but you ai n't got no home . It bur n't up . " As if on cue , Mr. Archy allowed the reins to slip from his hands . Finally , Ben stood and came down to the wagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to eat . " Mr. Archy was in no shape to refuse the offer , and responded to  | Ben 's extended hand . Down he came , and Ben helped him inside . Moses , feeling better , trailed with dancing eyes . Feebly , Mr. Archy was seated at the kitchen table . The boy quickly climbed up to the shelf , got a plate , hopped back down , and slid it in front of him . With the kettle already simmering , Ben took the plate and spooned it full of food . " Y'in for some mighty good eatin ' , Mr. Archy , " the boy said , crawling up in a chair and propping his elbows up on the table so that it could rest a head that was watching the visitor 's every move . With the plate in place and sight of the contents strongly contradicting what the boy had said , Mr. Archy cooled a polite forkful and bit down gingerly . It was most unappetizing , but he would n't let it show because he was too exhausted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the boy asked eagerly . Mr. Archy nodded affirmatively but weakly . " Got ' nuff there , or you want some more ? " " No , this is fine , thank you . " " Plenty more where that come from , huh , Unca Benny ? " Ben nodded . Moses persisted . " Want th ' kettle ? " " No . No , thank you , " Mr. Archy munched tenderly . " This is fine " " You can have th ' whole kettle if y'want . " " Thank you . But this really will do me " " Unca Benny lear n't how t'cook when he was in th ' cav'ry . Was you ever in th ' cav'ry , Mr. Archy ? " Ben knew the answer would be directed at him . And it was . " No , " Mr. Archy said as though trying to penetrate armor . " That 's one'a th ' pleasures I 've missed in life . Fact , I 've never been off th ' plantation . " From plate to lips to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archy 's every move . It was an extraordinary time for him . He had never seen Mr. Archy eat before . He had never seen him in the house . In fact , he had never seen Mr. Archy do anything but sleep at the creek and wagon into the yard . And that was no way to get to know someone . " Bet'cha never thought you 'd be eatin ' this good , huh , Mr. Archy ? " It was the most anemic of all head shakes .  | " Why don'cha give ' im some cracklin ' bread so 's he can sop his plate , Unca Benny ? " " S'all right , " Mr. Archy courteously interjected . " I do n't care for anythin ' else . But thank you anyway " " Y'dont know what you 're missin ' , Mr. Archy , " said the little salesman , " th ' cracklin ' bread soppin ' th ' plate is th ' best eatin ' of all . " " Sounds wunnerful " " Want some ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , you can get some if you want " " Thank you , but  --  cr ? " It became lost . Moses waited for a moment and energetically popped : " Bet'cha I know somethin ' you do n't . " " Um ? " " I 'm a Mister . Jus ' like y'self . " " Nice , " the man chewed thinly . The boy was quiet for a second or two and then , with his eyes still planted on the movement of the food said , " Where y'gonna sleep t'night , Mr. Archy ? " " All righ ' , m'boy , " Ben said , " that 's enough questions  --  c'm on , uut'cha go . Go play on the porch . " " Can I get m'hoe an ' go down by the creek ? " " S ' an even better idea . " " ' Bye , Mr. Archy . " " See y'later , son " See , there was that word son again . He did n't know exactly what it meant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awfully good , and added to that he said , " see you later . " Happily , he left them . Outside on the porch , before getting his hoe , the boy took a moment to reassess matters . It was a breathless time , there were so many things happening . The world was spinning by at break-neck speed , and these two were responsible for it . He had to catch up . These two were not just ordinary people  --  they were the hubs of the universe and something told him that there was more than work to be done , there was a commitment to be made . A dedication to the notion that these two hubs deserved the best he could give them .  | So , no , he would not race down to the creek , he would grab his hoe and walk . That way he could think . The two hubs deserved no less . Ben sat at the table . Without rushing , businesslike , he tossed a lidful of snuff inside his jaw . " Now , Archy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to brass tacks " Mr. Archy looked up from his plate . " Didn ' you forget somethin ' ? " Ben looked around to see what was forgotten . " Mister Archy , " the plantation owner said , reminding him of his station in life . " Mister Archy ? " Ben toyed with the word . " Well , ai n't gon na be no more of that Mista ' stuff when th ' boy ai n't around . " " Oh ? " " An ' when I do say it , I will be sayin ' it for his benefit an ' his benefit alone . " " Ummmhuh " " Y'see , I do n't want him to lose r'spect for you  --  jus ' yet . " " I see , " Mr. Archy said , suggesting that he was a step or two ahead of the black man that sat across the table . " Meanin ' that if he was to lose r'spect for me , he 'd lose it for you  --  bein 's that I was always over you " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An ' you ai n't doin ' too bad yourself , " Mr. Archy said in a voice that differed from a compliment . " N0000 , must say I ai n't . " " An ' it seems you ai n't just started . " " Well , now , I have been sorta keepin ' up with things  --  you know how ' t is " " No , I do n't , Ben . S'pose you tell me . " " We 'll get to it . " Mr. Archy pushed the plate aside and picked at the debris that had lodged between his teeth . Ben picked up the can of snuff and offered it to the man . Mr. Archy refused and tried to push the subject forward . " So what 's next ? " " Y'gotta choice to make . An ' it is your choice . Y'see , far be it for me to try an ' ' pose my will on you  --  see , I ai n't like some peoples I  | know  --  peoples that jus ' forces other peoples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on " " Now , ' bout that choice . I was thinkin ' that  --  well , you see , I been out in them fields all m'life  --  an ' you , on th ' other hand , you only been out there to  --  to  --  er , well , let 's jus ' say to  --  to visit . Now , for some reason or other , Archy , that jus ' do n't seem right . " " Oh , it do n't ? " Mr. Archy said easily . " No . It do n't . " " Well , then , why do n't you tell me what is right . " " You know what 's right , jus ' as good n ' well as I do . " " Ca n't you talk , Ben ? After all , in y'new position , you gon na have to know how to do that . Y'gonna have to know how to deal with people . Y'gonna have to be able to state y'position , come to a point . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple , Mr. Archy ? " " Watch it , Ben  --  you just call 'd me Mister . " It was an easy reminder , the smooth work of the other hand at play with the born-to-be-inferior . Ben realized the mistake , hesitated for a bit , and then continued as though nothing had happened . " Mr. Archy ? " " Yes , Mr. Ben ? " Ben hated  --  despised himself for making the same old dumb mistake . Mr. Archy smiled knowingly . " It takes years , Ben . " " I do n't give a good gandam if it takes th ' rest of m'life , I 'm gon na do it ! " he flared , and then realized for the first time in his life he had actually uttered a profane word . And again he felt terrible . Mr. Archy looked at him and penetrated : " What are you tryin ' to say , Ben ? " " I 'm sayin ' ? not tryin ' to say that , one : I 'm gon na beat that Mister thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm gon na do it  --  an ' two : I 'm gon na see you out in them fields  --  sweatin ' ? like I been doin ' all my life ! " Mr. Archy , still maintaining reserve : " An ' then what ? " " I 'll think of somethin ' , Mr. Archibald McBride . Th ' of darkie will  | think of somethin ' . An ' you can sit there an ' think y'self as high'n mighty as you want , but I will think of somethin ' ? an ' no more will you ever get th ' best of me  --  or th ' boy . " " How 've I been gettin ' th ' best of th ' boy ? " " It 's his lan ' . " " I see , " an unruffled Mr. Archy said , and then reared back in the weak-backed chair thoughtfully . " Lemme ask you somethin ' , Ben . If you knew th ' boy own 'd th ' property , how come you did n't do nothin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' them , " Ben responded smartly . " Y'see it wouldn'a been healthy if they know 'd a lil ' colored boy owned anythin ' ? an ' you could'a tied in with ' em . Now you ca n't . " " So , now , " Mr. Archy said slowly , " you plannin ' on takin ' th ' boy an ' leavin ' ? " " Oh , if I could'a done that , I'da done it a long time ago . You must'a didn ' read all'a them papers , ' cause I know it say in ' em somewhere that the boy 's got ta stay on th ' property . " " An ' why 's that ? " " B'cause Miss Mildred wanted him to always be righ ' where you could see ' im . Always in your eyesight . Sorta like a r'minder to your conscience we always thought you never had . " " We ? Who 's we ? ' An ' who figgered all that out , Ben ? " " Miss Mildred , " Ben said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With whose help did you figger that ? " " Friend o ' hers . In Lumberton . " " Th ' same man who drove her to Fayetteville , I s'pose th ' same man who falsifi 'd papers . My marriage . You 're talkin ' ' bout that preacherman " " Trouble is , Mr. Archy , he wo n't no preacher , " Ben said knowledgeably . " He was a jackleg . " What Ben was trying to say  --  as the deed to the land was trying to indicate  --  was : " If they wo n't no real preacher , they wo n't no real marriage . An ' if they wo n't no real marriage , Archibald McBride wo n't entitled to no real property . " Had Mr. Archy been normal , had he been able to think clearly rather than leave Fayetteville in a state of shock , he would have con-  | eluded that the above notion was ridiculous . But then to hear Ben give credence to the absurdity by saying the preacher was a jackleg was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have thought of before , but he was n't going to worry about it . He had no reason to . Bogus and sham marriages were nothing new in the Carolinas . They even sanctioned inbreeding . The courts had dealt with the issue ; the courts had ruled on the issue . There was nothing else to be said . Archibald McBride was on firm ground . So convinced of his position was he  --  and of something else he had in mind  --  Mr. Archy did not devote undue time to the matter , and though it appeared that his seeming calm and upperhandedness had crumbled at the sound of the words , there was a resiliency about him . He was not the same ; it was not the same old Mr. Archy who would fire off a barrage with or without sufficient cause . It was not that he was surrendering everything . But the feistiness was gone  --  the arrogance had waned . Oh , sure , he was still Ben 's superior  --  always would be . But even that did not have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraction of what it had been the day before . Something else had replaced that complex mechanism that ticked the movements of Archibald McBride . It could have been argued that the trouble with the Red Springers  --  especially the killing , the fire , the destruction of the big house  --  Fayetteville  --  the idiocy of even going to Fayetteville , let alone what had transpired there , all or any one of those things should have sent him under and , for sure , would have changed the balance of any man 's mechanism . But not Archibald McBride . And now , best of all , full sanity was back . Ben knew who he was dealing with , and he had to be careful . He rose , went to the tub , and stayed in that area , realizing Mr. Archy had n't said anything for a minute or so . " Now , like I said before , Archy , " Ben said , studying him , " I ai n't th ' kind that likes to be forcin ' peoples inta things they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a choice . If you do n't go this'a way , " Ben said , pointing to the direction of the fields , " then , you goes that'a way . " Patiently , slowly , Mr. Archy started unloading his position . " Now let me tell you one gawddam 'd thing ? " " Ah , ah , ah , " Ben freely admonished hin . " Now , Archy , I want you  | to consider y'position . You is both homeless an ' friendless . An ' that ai n't good in this day an ' age . An ' cussin at me ai n't gon na do you no good " " Ben , " Mr. Archy said advisedly . " If I had my rifle , I 'd blow a hole plum ' through you . " " Ummhuh . An ' then what ? " Ben said , confidently coming back to the table and using the term he 'd used before . Mr. Archy did nothing . And though he looked at him harshly , he still was n't fired into action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben  --  even when he made the threat about the rifle  --  there was no real menace to his words . " Y'kno somethin ' , Mr. Archy , " Ben said , and not really caring about employing the word Mister . " You gon na have to start doin ' a heap a'changin ' . Things like that rifle talk keeps you in trouble . " It was obvious Mr. Archy 's mind was n't where he wanted it to be . He wanted to respond differently  --  but yet he wanted to get something off his chest , something he had wanted to say to the ex-slave earlier , and something he had been reminded of when he was in Fayetteville and saw the Market House and all the things that brought back the days of slavery . " Ben " ? he seated himself and started off reflectively ? " you ask 'd me why you stayed on my land . I said you stayed on b'cause you ai n't got a pot to pee in . That 's true , but that wo n't all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinkin ' about it . Thought ' bout it a lot . An ' now , sittin ' here , watchin ' an ' listenin ' to you , I know a lil ' bit more . Lemme tell you what I 've come up with ; lemme tell you why you 're still here . Out there you 've got to fend for yourself . Y'all got what you wanted . Freedom . Th ' master ca n't tell you nothin ' no more . He ca n't tell you where to go , how to go , when to squat  --  nothin ' , cause you 're free . The color 'd man is free . Thank the Almighty for th ' favor he done . I 've even thanked m'self ! But then , on th ' day I freed th ' coloreds , I sent you out there to give ' em the word . R'member ? Y'know why I did it , Ben ? I was inside feelin ' sorry  --  feelin ' sorry for who ? ? m'self or th ' slaves ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to m'self : I said you free 'd ' em , Archy , but the first night of freedom  --  where they goin ' ? How they gon na get there ? I said to m'self , tell ' em do n't go lookin ' for th ' northern white  | man that say he fought for y'freedom . He 's gon na tell you he 's done all that he 's gon na do ? ' for y'freedom . ' In his mind there 's a sign that says Niggers , go that-a-way ' ? go away from me . He 's gon na say , Get away from me  --  an ' stay away from me ! ' Ben you 're free , all right . You free , but you too dumb to read his mind and too blind to read the sign . Your slavery 's over , but ai n't nothin ' gon na change . A hunnert years from today , two hunnert years from today , you still gon na be sufferin ' an ' shufflin ' . You might not be shufflin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' as much . " " Th ' coloreds ' biggest thing in life is not knowin ' how deep the white man 's dislike of you is . An ' he 's smart enough to get you to do enough to dislike yourselves . Now , when this slavery thing is completely done with , years from today , he 's gon na give you a lot . Some coloreds might be livin ' high on the hog one day , might even be invited to th ' white man 's home  --  might even share a drink or a cigar with ' im . But th ' one thing he ai n't never gon na give you  --  an ' I 'm gon na r'peat this , Ben , he will always  --  always think he knows more'n you . An ' he ai n't never , he ai n't never gon na give you r'spect . He can be twenty times dumber'n you , he ai n't gon na give you the one thing that makes you equal : respect . An ' like a fool , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd thing about it  --  an ' th ' bad thing about that is the colored man 's got th ' advantage . He do n't know it , an 'll never use it . " Now , there 's somethin ' else I waned you to think about while enjoyin ' your newfound freedom  --  an ' I say this because to be truly free , you 've got to be truly able : You sick  --  your children need somethin ' as simple as croatin ' oil , how you gon na read th ' label ? You free , but you hungry  --  fatback cost a quarter a slab , sorghum ten cents a bucket . Th ' body need nurishin ' . Go buy what you need . G'woan , dig in y'pocket , pay for it . Th ' body needs sleep . Buy some burlap , some canvas . Get it ! Buy some land , nails , tar , lumber ; buy y'self a hammer , a saw , an ax ; go ' head , build you someplace t'stay . Now , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th ' things . A long time ago , and I do n't know why she did it , but I saw Mildred give you a pocketful of money . How much was it , Ben ? I 'm sure you counted it a hunnert times . Show me how somebody from Africa is gon na function in this  | land of lib'rty . Tell th ' mean , old ex-slave master , somebody hog-tied to ignorance and tradition , tell him ; tell him how much you got . Do one simple thing for me  --  no , do it for yourself go get th ' money and count it ! Add , multiply , or subtract ! But count ! " Ben looked at him wordlessly . " No , do n't look at me like I 'm crazy , Ben . Count . Like I said , to be truly free , you got to be truly able . Countin ' goes a long way t'ward showin ' what you got upstairs " Ben withdrew his look and said nothing . " You can do it , ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much you got goin ' . Prove it . Count . " Ben still refused to do or say anything . " C'm on , Ben ! The price of wheat is risin ' ! " Again Ben looked at him , still refusing . " A simple little thing like countin ' your money ? C'm on , Ben ! " Ben finally surrendered . " I been too busy t'count . " " You 're a liar ! Count ! One and one is two ! Two an ' one is what , Ben ? " Once again the old black man lapsed into silence . He got up and moved away . Mr. Archy was furious . He charged after him . " What is one an ' one , Ben ? Two an ' two ? C'm on , count'cha money ! The white man is gon na clean you out if you ca n't count ! C'm on  --  add , Ben , add : One an ' one is two , two an ' one is what ? Go on from there , Ben @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , count : One ! Two ! Three ! Go on from there , Ben ! Countin ' is just th ' start of it ! If you ai n't got it in your head , you ai n't got it nowhere ! " " All right ! You made y'point ! You done made y'point ! I ca n't read and I ca n't count ! An ' you know it ! You know it b'cause when th ' slaves got t'gether an ' did try'n learn a little somethin ' you put a stop to it ! You an ' th ' law put a stop to it ! Now I ca n't read , an ' I ca n't write ! But that ai n't got a damn 'd thing to do with what 's goin ' on now . " " All righ ' , then , lemme get to that . " Mr. Archy positioned himself to say it : " Negro " ? and it was the first time he had ever used the  | word . " I ai n't no different than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead an ' in my grave b'fore I let you or anybody like you take over my land . " " Then , Mr. Archy , you might as well get on out there an ' start dig-gin ' , ' cause it 's gone . " Mr. Archy started off slowly , and said as if addressing every black who ever lived , " Mr. Colored Man : If you ca n't do somethin ' as simple as count , all the schemin ' in th ' world ai n't gon na do you no good . " Ben digested it and said " You wrong , Mr. Archy . Dead wrong . I ai n't been schemin ' . I been thinkin ' . " " You ai n't capable of thinkin ' ! That 's what I 've been tryin ' to tell you all along ! Colored man , you ai n't capable of thinkin ' ! " " I might not be able to think th ' way you want me to think , but I done ' null of it to put me in better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Th ' boy owns th ' lan ' . " " I would n't bet my life on that if I was you " " I 'd bet mine , yours , and his . I do n't know what I haft ' a do or how to make it more clear to you , but th ' boy owns the land ! An ' he got it by me thinkin ' ! " Ben shot up from the table and fired again . " Me , Ben  --  THINKIN ' ! An ' if I hadn'a been thinkin ' , what would'a hap-pen 'd to ' im  --  even without th ' lan ' ? What would'a happen 'd to him if I hadn'a stayed on ' round here ? What would you 'd a'done with a lil ' black young'un you ca n't stand th ' sight of ? Huh ? What would'a happen 'd to him ? You would'a tared an ' feather 'd him , that 's what you would'a done ! Tarr 'd an ' feather 'd ' im ! An ' ask y'self this  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' im if I hadn'a been interest 'd in what was goin ' on ? What would'a happen 'd even if I hadn'a been standin ' there that night , waitin ' for th ' birth of somethin ' that you was r'sponsible for ? That 's how long I been thinkin ' , Mr. McBride ! That 's how long 's it been ! " Ben had been excessive , as Mr. Archy would not have tarred and feathered anyone . He would not have physically harmed anyone . Ben had scored heavily with the point . And Mr. Archy knew it . He  | remained motionless for a long while . His mind made another involuntary trip back to that night  --  that night the results of which could not have been questioned . Mr. Archy had been in Fayetteville for the week , but still his body tensed hard , always as if he had been there that night , always as if he could hear the screams , and always as if he could see the blood spewing from an uncoordinated uterus and an unwilling placenta that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to comply with the natural order of birth . Louder grew the screams that night as the team swelled and used a blockinglike tactic that for a moment looked as though they would prevent any hope of life-bearing passage . And the screams grew louder still , screams from a young black slave-girl , swallowed in the newness of delivery , sweating , grunting , and pushing with a determination that only a mother would know . It was through her efforts and her efforts alone that defeated the conspiracy . The moment came . There was a release . Down it came and so did the blood . But the blood would not stop . The boy survived . But the mother would never know . " Ben . . . Ben , you just said standin ' there that night waitin ' for th ' birth ... " ' Mr. Archy had measured and reevaluated what Ben had said . It took a while longer , and then he asked : " Ben , you just said ? " He lost it for a moment . He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You said standin ' there waitin ' when the boy was born , didn ' you ? An ' that 's been your story all along , ai n't it ? Standin ' there waitin ' . " Ben would n't answer because in firing off his delivery , he had slipped . He made a crucial admission , and he knew it . What he said was at definite odds with the original story , the story so often repeated when Mr. Archy would come into the yard with the troubled mind , reliving again and again : " What a night that must have been . " " It was a rough one , Mr. Archy . " " A goddamn plantation full'a slaves , an ' , Ben , you could n't find one of ' em . An ' when you got back from lookin ' for help , it was too late . " " Too late , Mr. Archy. "  | " An ' not a midwife in sight . " " Not a one . " " An ' it rain 'd that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why I hate storms to this day . " " Me too , Mr. Archy . " " If  --  if only you could'a found  --  what was that loud , fat one 's name ? " " Elsie Pratt . But she wo n't here at th ' time . " " If you could'a found somebody like her  --  somebody  --  anybodysomebody that could'a taken charge  --  somebody who knew ' bout birthin ' . . . Charlotte wouldn'a . . . She 'd still be here . . . She 'd still be alive . " " She 'd still be alive , Mr. Archy . " " An ' you had to d'liver th ' boy by yourself " " By m'self " " All alone . " " All alone , Mr. Archy . " " All alone . An ' from a dead woman . " " Yassuh . " " Poor Charlotte . " The troubled old white man ran it through his mind twice more . Suddenly he came alive : " Ben , Ben , you couldn'a been standin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' boy was born . You wo n't there . You said you went to the far slave-house to get one'a th ' women folk who knew somethin ' about birthin ' . A midwife . You said you went to find somebody  --  anybody  --  an ' when you came back , Charlotte was dead . Alone an ' dead . An ' then th ' baby was deliver'dby you . All by yourself . Ai n't that what you told me , Ben ? Ai n't that what you told me and Mildred ? Ai n't that what you told th ' slaves ? You told everybody  --  you wo n't there ! Ai n't that wha'cha said , Ben ? " Ben was trapped , and he knew it . He was silent . Drawn . Mr. Archy charged from around the table . " Talk to me , Ben ! " Ben said nothing . " Gawdammit , man . Talk to me ! "  | Still Ben would say nothing . By this time he had managed to sit , but there was an urge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body shaking with threat . " Talk to me ! What did you do to her . Ben ? What on gawd 's earth did you do ? " Now the man with the hump on his back had to move . He rose , brushed Mr. Archy aside , and went and stood by the tub . Mr. Archy started to charge after him , then stopped , lowered his voice , and pleaded , " Ben , for gawd 's sake , please  --  please , tell me what you did . " Ben stood motionless by the sink . " Tell me what happen 'd . How did she die ? How did she go , Ben ? You can tell me somethin ' . " The pleas fell on deaf ears . Ben stood there , still saying nothing , looking at nothing . The hump on his back was hurting . More time , and Mr. Archy came to his own conclusion . Slowly he said , " You  --  you just let her die , didn ' you ? Didn ' you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . " Ben  --  didn ' you let Charlotte die ? " Although Ben said nothing , Mr. Archy knew . He knew that his servant had let the young girl die . Mr. Archy came closer . " But why , Ben ? Why ? Why 'd you do it ? Why ? " He would ask him several more times , varying the question , but Ben would say nothing . The white man came back to the table and buried his face in his hands for a moment . He then got up , circled the kitchen again , and returned to the table . " You let her die  --  you just let her die . You let my woman and that boy 's mother die " The old white man simply could not come to terms with it . " You let Charlotte die .... Do you have any idea what she must'a felt ? What she must'a been goin ' through . " There was no way he was going to be able to get over it , and the only thing he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  which he did . But it was a failing effort . He did n't rush , but when he finally came back inside , Ben still had n't moved . Mr. Archy sat . He would n't let go , and as though talking to himself  | first , he sighed heavily . " All the years  --  all the wasted years .... All the hurt . B'sides takin ' her life . . . Ben , do you have any idea how much of my life you wasted ? " He did not receive , nor was he expecting an answer . He took more time , and went in a different direction : " You kill 'd somebody . You kill 'd one of your own . Why ? " Even if Mr. Archy had continued looking at him directly , Ben could not face the man , and , again , it did not appear as if he were in search of an answer . For a moment longer he stood there , hanging on the tub . Soberly , after that , he collected himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not follow him . It was a bad night to recall , that September night when the boy was born . It had been ushered in by weeks of stiff and solid Carolina rain , and the young girl was terrified at being in the old unsteady place . Worse still , as she had told Mr. Archy months before , she simply did not like being around the old black man with the tilted head and a hump on his back . If slave Charlotte had remained in the big house , where she normally was quartered , there is no doubt the outcome would have been different . But Mrs. McBride had so taunted her during the last days of pregnancy that she , at Mr. Archy 's strongly worded suggestion , moved in with Ben . Ben , as he promised Mr. Archy , would take care of her . At the proper time it was said that there would be a midwife on hand even though Mr. Archy knew that there was apt to be trouble with some of the female slaves . This was so mainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting interim help , Ben had told Mr. Archy that owing to harvesting season , he had been rebuffed at every turn , but at the expected time , someone would be there to assist in the delivery . It bothered Mr. Archy that none of the slaves would come over before that time , but he was also aware of the demands of harvesting . Further complicating the matter was the fact that neither he nor Ben could do much more than gently nudge for assistance in fear of arousing added suspicions , particularly those of the now strangely subdued Mrs. McBride . If anyone had reason to be suspicious of the pregnancy , it should have been Mildred McBride . Often when she and slave Charlotte  | were alone , the perky and uppity young miss would float all too freely around the big place , and , as though she were momentarily about to be crowned lady-in-residence , she would gaily chime about redoing this or restructuring that , and , in general , revamping the entire plantation . In her second favorite spot  --  the first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sprawling oaks in the front yard . But it was in the master bedroom , her true favorite , where she would coo and sigh and drop unsubtle little tidbits about the titillating prowess of the plantation owner  --  still later , even though it had been drilled into her head by Mr. Archy and meekly supported by Ben , that the escaped slave she had once taken up with was supposed to be the father , she further rippled waters by enrapturedly melodizing to the lady of the house . " M'baby 's gon na have light skin , an ' rich , straight hair  --  sump'um like Mr. Archy 's . " Small wonder the other woman once again went to her preacherman friend in Lumberton . Revenge is mine , sayeth the Lord . The night of baby Moses 's birth had been particularly rough on Charlotte . Thunder and lightning belted the skies , and the rain came through Ben 's ceiling as though it had never seen a roof . Every inch of the old shack was soaked , and his plugging and patching efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid , and rhythmically paining , and now panicking on the drenched cot , with sweat and rain blanketing her face , the young girl cried out in further pain , " Bennnn ! Ben  --  h'its comin ' ! H'its comin , Ben ! " She had cried out earlier as well , but not with the same pain and urgency . Pain or not , urgency or not , Ben did nothing . Incredibly , he made no attempt to go and fetch help . Incredibly , he stood there  --  in total detachment , fumbling with an old patch rag . Sporadic pain gave way to the short bursts , and the girl screamed her last series . It was only after she had pleaded and bloodied herself into unconsciousness that the old black man with a hump on his back finally made a move . But then , instead of helping her , or going for black help , he went to the big house  --  and there , carrying out what had been secretly prearranged , Mrs. McBride  --  Mildred  --  met him at  | the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied him back to the shack . There she performed the delivery . She cleaned and wrapped the boy called Moses . They did not look at  --  nor did they touch the young girl . A moment more , and Charlotte had no more blood to give .  | The genuinely distraught Mr. Archy did not stay in Ben 's kitchen long , and when he left , he was still grim , still searching . At the edge of the porch he stood , staring out in thought . The two men did not look at each other , and though tired , Mr. Archy would not sit . Finally , with an unreadable commitment on his haggard face , he ambled off the porch and walked slowly down the path that led to the creek . He hoped the boy was there . Moses was comfortable on the ground , legs cocked in the air , both hands serving as little pillows under a daydreaming head . The thinking period had been put on hold . With the hoe beside him , he was taking in the deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved the sky because one could lay on the ground and still paint a thousand and one pictures on the never-ending ceiling and still have room for more . And the clouds : ah , those great , great , wonderful clouds . What a treat . Clouds were always Johnny-on-the-spot , always at the right place at the right time , adding that right touch . Even when they moved , they did so with a gentleness and solemnity that defied words  --  and they were mindful enough not to erase the pictures . The big puffy clouds were his favorites . They were dimpled , huggable , and they reminded him of giant , free-formed marshmallows . Sometimes they made him hungry . He imagined they were not quite as tasty as that little piece of lightly fried licorice he had that time , but there could have been a nice sponginess to them . Lately he had begun to wonder if any of his friends had ever taken a plug out of them . But  | that would not have been right , he thought , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridden on them ; and , if so , what was it like ? Were they as cushy and soft as they looked ? An ' what made them move ? ? Ain ' t no horses up there . Do they have fun ? ? Do n't see ' em laughin ' . They ever get sad ? ? Never seen no tears . How 'd they get up there in the first place ? ? Ai n't no stairs up there . Did they have a mule ? ? Do n't see no barn . An ' how can they just stay up there ? ? Ai n't no string tied to ' em . An ' where do they sleep at night ? ? Ai n't no beds up there . Where they eat ? ? Do n't see no tables . What happens when it rains ? ? Ai n't got no shelter . An ' when it gets cold ? That 's it . Clouds should have something to keep them warm . Maybe a quilt . He had a spare . And if they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them anyway  --  they should get to know each other . But first he would check with his friends beneath the covers . Maybe they would like to go along . " ' Lo , son . " The boy rolled over without fully seeing the stooped figure . " Well , hi ? 0000ps , Mr. Archy ! " he said , finally realizing he was not talking to a dropped cloud , and simultaneously starting to scramble to his feet so that he could run . " No , do n't get up , " the man said . " Mind if I have a seat ? " " Y ' mean you gon na sit on th ' ground ? " " Why , of course . I do n't see too many chairs ' round here . " " No , " the boy said , seriously looking around . " Do n't see none . But I 'll run back to th ' kitchen an ' get'cha one . " " No , no " Mr. Archy smiled and tried to sit without showing undue strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was probable that he would not have survived had it not been for the boy 's quizzical but innately bouncy spirit . " Shore is a pretty sky , huh , Mr. Archy , " the boy said with more than a wee bit of nervousness still hanging on . " Ummhuh "  | " S'got a lotta clouds hangin ' from it . I like clouds . Clouds r'mind me of Sweet Elsie Pratt . Y'like clouds , Mr. Archy ? " " Love ' ern . " " How far y'think they is ? " " Too far for an old-timer like me to tell . " " Y'really a old-timer , Mr. Archy ? " " Yep . An ' at th ' moment I feel every bit of it " " Howz a old-timer feel ? " " Not too good " " Is Unca Benny a old-timer too ? " Mr. Archy tossed something he wanted to say about the other man away , " In a way , I s'pose he is . Might even be a little bit more . " He then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched it sink . " You know somethin ' , Mr. Archy , " said the boy , itching , but yet with the solemnity and pace of a confession , " I know y'been mad at me , but I don ' mean to do y ' creek no harm . I mean , I  --  I ? I jus ' come out here ' cause I like it . This is my f'vorite spot in th ' whole wide world . I did do number one in it a couppla times , Suh , but never number two . An ' th ' water never did get salty . " " That 's all right , son . You keep on comin ' , an ' do in it wha'cha want . " " An ' you ai n't gon na get mad at me no more ? " Mr. Archy hunched his knees up and rolled a ball of dirt between his fingers . " From now on , th ' creek is yours , son . " " Mine ? " " Umhum . " " Th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ca n't have a creek without water . " " Oooh , Mr. Archy  --  this is jus ' soon nice . This is th ' best thing I ever did get . " " I 'm glad to do it . " " Is th ' mud mine too ? " " Th ' mud , th ' water  --  everythin ' " The boy swelled : " Oooh , L-L-Lordy , Lordy . " He jumped . " Hottttzzzigidy . Can I run an ' tell somebody I got it ? "  | " Sure . But who you gon na tell ? " The boy thought about it for a second . Mr. Archy was being real , real nice but would he understand the friends beneath the covers ? Anyway , they were secret pals . " Nobody , " he said . There was a lowliness to it , and then he looked at it and bounced back : " This is s00000 nice . " " Listen , son , " Mr. Archy said after the boy had settled a bit , and after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think you could ever get along without your uncle Benny ? " " O000h , n000 , suh . Never in a million years , " the boy said automatically and sincerely . And happily  --  and unable to keep his eyes off of " his " water . " S'pose . . . s'pose ? I mean if he did somethin ' bad . I mean real , real bad " " He would n't do nothin ' like that . Y'think th ' water needs anythin ' ? Maybe sumthin ' t'eat ? " " I 'm not really sure . But I do n't think so . " With such firmness on Ben , Mr. Archy knew it was n't going to work . Without looking up at him directly , he consumed more minutes and picked up with : " Your maw . You ever give any thought to who your maw was ? " " Unca Benny said I never had one . " " You had one . An ' she was a good one , the best . " " You know 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Did'ja like her ? " " Mor'n that , son . . . . Far mor'n that . " " Why ? " " Why ? B'cause they didn ' make ' em any better . " Mr. Archy thought about her for a moment more . " She had spirit . Heart . An ' she was very smart , an ' very special . You 're a spittin ' image of her . " " That time when Elsie Pratt come by , she was like a maw . Maybe a gran'maw . She told me to be good , an always love th ' Lord " " T ' was nice of her . Now , son ? " " Know where she went ? " " No , no , I do n't . " And he did n't . He did n't really know her . She had been just another number , a worker  --  and like so many of his num-  | hers who disappeared without reason , he 'd never given her much thought . But now that the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Archy never knew a body had burned in New Hope Church that night . Of course , he knew there was a fire . The church sat deep off the road  --  along that vast stretch between his place and Red Springs . Mr. Archy had smelled the smoke , came out on to his porch , saw the smoke and the distant glow , concluded that it was nothing belonging to him , and never thought any more about it . " Your paw . Did your uncle ever say anythin ' about him ? " " Said I ai n't never had one'a them either , " the boy said , untroubled . It was rough on the old man , but he continued on troubled waters : " If you had a chance to have a paw , a paw that was , well , s-s-sorta different ? " His voice halted uncomfortably and the touchiness of the subject left him on more than unfirm grounds , for if the boy had answered in the affirmative , what would he have done ? The boy nonchalantly withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's my creek . Back into the water went one foot , and into the mud went the other . " Y'aint mad , is you , Mr. Archy ? " " No , son . You jus ' go on an ' enjoy yourself . " The boy sought to do just that . Fully clothed , he jumped in and started paddling like a rowboat . " Son  --  what if ? ? H-h-how would you take to havin ' ? to havin ' a paw ? " " Don ' really need one long 's I got Unca Benny . " " Ah , but you 'd have a paw  --  your own flesh'n blood . You 'd have somebody that cares for you , somebody to teach you things , somebody to look out for you " " But that 's Unca Benny . " " Do you know what a future is ? " " No , suh . " " Well , that 's what you got ta have . An ' as smart as you is , you can have a great one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , suh . " " Y'ever hear of a somethin ' call 'd readin ' an ' writin ' ? " " Yessuh "  | " Would you like t'start learnin ' how to read ? How to write ? " " Ma'be t'start learnin ' how t'read . " " Y ' can start both of ' ern . " " No , suh . " " Why not ? " " Lately I been thinkin ' I do n't wan na learn ' bout no writin ' . " " Why not ? " The boy came out of the water briefly , spotted a worm , and slid back in . " How come you do n't wan na learn no writin ' ? " " I 'm color 'd , " he replied . " I ai n't got nothin ' to write about . " It was obvious the boy 's delivery had hurt him . It was obvious Mr. Archy was hurt in other ways as well . The cynic , the hardened , or the unforgiving could have very well argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they very well could have questioned his motives . They could have argued , too  --  with certain justification  --  that he had lived a virtual lifetime desensitized to the lives of the downtrodden , and that it was because of people like him that this boy felt unattached to a past and bereft of a history . The cynic , the hardened , or the unforgiving could have said that he sat there manufacturing a change after the harsh and crushing news from Fayetteville and now that he was without the big house , he had no choice but to change , and sit there in clumsy and suspicious acknowledgment of paternal-ship  --  if he had changed at all . But , to be fair , the trio should have taken closer scrutiny of Archibald McBride , and surely of the man on the way to Fayetteville ? before he received the ownership news  --  if at the time he was capable of receiving news at all . But beyond anything else , the trio should have acknowledged that the change did not occur solely because of the transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of it , but there were other considerations . One , and it should have been examined more closely , the man  --  or the man 's conscience  --  had been ground to a pulp by the mere mentioning of the name Priminger in connection with the boy , and then further along , it had been picked up , reassaulted , hammered , and traumatized by the sheer gall , the absolute audacity of Mildred , a supposed wife , who , with the help of  | a jackleg idiot from Lumberton , executed a document , listing herself as mother . And then there was that matter with Ben . " Your maw , " said the man , getting up . " She 'd a'been proud of you . " He came over and placed a fatherly arm around his son 's shoulder . The boy was a little bit frightened , a little bit exhilarated . He did n't understand it , none of it , but , then again , there was a lot about Mr. Archy he never understood  --  to include him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . My , my , my , ai n't life nice ? To which he said , " Would Sweet Elsie Pratt be proud of me too ? " " Yes . Yes , she would . " Whoever Sweet Elsie was , she would have been awfully proud . And then he had one question before leaving . " Son , if you had one wish , any wish you wanted in the world , what would it be ? " " I 'd have to ask th ' Lord for it " " What would you ask Him ? " " T'make you an ' Unca Benny like each other . " It had an achievable ring to it ; the man would not forget it . Moses continued : " An ' I 'd like to have a dog . " And then he added dismissively , " But I do n't really need one . Unca Benny say they eat too much . Maybe a El ' piece of licorice . But Unca Benny say they all out o'that , an ' they ai n't gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole wide world I 'd jus ' like for you an ' Unca Benny t'like each other . I dream ' bout that . " Mr. Archy gave it serious thought . He wanted to say , if that 's what it takes to make you happy , that 's what will happen . An ' if you want a dog , I 'll get you a whole kennel of dogs . An ' the licorice ? well , maybe a sack full . But he did n't say it . It was in his heart . But he did n't say it . What he did say before heading back to the house was : " Thanks for savin ' my life . " He moved part way to the path , stopped , and turned . Off to his left , away from where the boy was enjoying the creek , was the other path that led to where the plantation had stood . Mr. Archy looked in that direction for a long time . Memories came back to him , but he would n't allow them to linger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thanks for saving my life ? twice . " The boy was at a momentary loss . He had forgotten all about the  | fire , and that second thanks ? Whatever it was for it was nice to hear . " Thanks for th ' creek , Mr. Archy . I 'm gon na take th ' best care of it . An ' if you ever need anythin ' , jus ' holler . " Mr. Archy did something he had n't done in years . He laughed pleasantly . He thought about it  --  and the plantation . He moved away , smiling . In the water the boy did a half cartwheel . " Wait ' til m'friends under th ' quilt hears about this ! " Mister Moses owns a creek ! Mud an ' all ! Yeah , yeah , yeah . It was a sure but strained darkness that enveloped the old place . A pensive and motionless Mr. Archy was sitting on the far side of the porch . The other chair , well away from him , was empty but shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were moments of cricket-chirping quiet , and then , inside , Ben 's silhouetted figure doused the light . The new owner of the creek slid excitedly under the liberally and permanently stained patched quilt , and the muffled voice was heard to say , " Say g'night to Mr. Archy . An ' tell ' im I gon na take good care of our creek " The thought did nothing for Ben , and he left the room without comment . When he came out on the porch he did not acknowledge the other man 's presence and moped over to the rocker as though he did n't have a care in the world . It was strictly a pretense because the man that was sitting to his far left , aside from a greatly eased conscience , was in enough trouble to last for quite a while . He knew , too , that something had to give . But the problem was that if he gave  --  even if he did something as unthinkable as getting out of Red Springs forever  --  the situation still could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no way on God 's earth that the Red Springs bunch would even come close to tolerating the thought of all that acreage falling into black hands . Whether Mildred had a legal right to turn over the property was not the point . The legalities , he knew , could have been contested on several counts  --  except one . And that one could not have been easily dismissed . It was a major issue and it surely deserved more thought .  | In all accuracy , though , and as stunning and woefully contrary as it might have sounded , on the way back from Fayetteville , and further supported by his trip to the creek , one of the thoughts that had seeped into his mind was that he  --  Archibald McBride  --  should have been the one to have given the land to the boy , and no one had the right to usurp him of the privilege . He was old , time was running out  --  what was he going to do with it ? But no matter what he thought , Mildred heat him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an idiot . Mildred was a long-gone dead-and-buried idiot who had no right to do what she did . Earlier he thought he would fight the issue . That was one of his positions , and whether that one came about because he was tired , whether he felt life had already beaten him into submission , or whether , and certainly more likely , that one consideration was aided by the seductive qualities of a strange morning 's dawn that had oozed inside of him and brought back those never-to-be-forgotten bed-shaking , free and wild and enraptured times known only to him and a slave that could turn him upside down with the bat of an eyelash , that was his position . Archibald McBride 's position . There was an addendum to the deed . The document , as written , stipulated that the boy had to remain on the land , where he would always be seen by Mr. Archy . But then , if it had to be questioned , what if Mr. Archy were no longer around ? What if he died ? The land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not of legal age ; there was no record of birth ; and Ben , as his guardian , in fact , was not his legal kin , and even so , like most of the slave-reared fieldhands , he could n't prove his own existence  --  legal or otherwise . In the matter of Ben , surely the questions would come : Where were you born ? When were you born ? Parents ? Where were they born ? What were their names ? Do n't know . Do n't know . Do n't know . Do n't know . All right , what is your name ? Ben . Ben what ? Ben nothing . It was a dirty , rotten shame , that 's what it was . Ben what ? Here he was , an ancient , beaten-down , hump-backed black who knew absolutely nothing about himself or the world he lived in . The only thing he knew was that he was born somewhere , at some time , and at some place ; born to do nothing but labor all of his natural life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and grew worse with the  | passing years .

Forget the niggers , darkies , coons , pickaninny , and all the other things he had been called at one time or another , he had a name . A name of his own . When ? Long time ago , that 's when . Long before that knot he got from his mother started spreading and swallowed the neck and crooked the head to the side ; before African-named maw know 'd that African-named paw was sold and sailed quietly out of view down the Senegal River , leaving her to hold everything together . Long before he came over on the boat , and long before , too , he saw her in the same look-alike chains , being taken off the same look-alike boat .

Priminger liked him , named him , and gave him a home . At first Mildred thought it was an appalling idea , but relented somewhat when Priminger convinced her that he would be exceptionally obedient , and that because of his deformity , he was less likely to be unruly .

He thought about it again and , trying to get away from it , he concluded , " That whole night was jus ' ? jus ' too unreal . "  | As far as Ben was concerned , the subject was dismissed . Again , never once weighing the gravity of his wrong . Fortunately Mr. Archy never knew of the conspiracy , and fortunately he did n't have that to contend with . Still , it took a long while for him to speak again , and when he did , it was about Mildred . " Mildred never would'a understood what I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white wimmin would'a unda'stood , Mr. Archy ? An ' th ' way you went ' bout it , she thought that it violated somethin ' . " " What ? Marriage ? " Mr. Archy said , thinking back to the occasion and what they had talked about earlier . " I 'm suppose 'd to believe that there wo n't no gandamn marriage . Ai n't that 's th ' whole point of it ? Th ' gawdamn preacher was a jackleg . " He could have also added , since the entire matter was clear to him now , that not only was the preacherman a jackleg , he was also a falsifying notary . This was a matter he was going to get to later , as well as what he intended to do about it . But the old man concluded his thoughts with what he thought was a touch of irony : " So young Archibald McBride was tricked by an old woman and a jackleg preacherman " " Umhuh , " Ben said . " A jackleg preacher an ' suppos 'd to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it didn ' matter who he was . Th ' lan ' was hers . All hers . She could do with it what she waned . " " I 'm gon na tell you again , Ben . Do n't be too sure about that . " Getting married in lowly Lumberton was not fashionable and Mr. Archy did loosely question it at the time . Mildred said that it was something she wanted to do , and that was that . Mr. Archy had always believed that she felt uncomfortable because he was much younger than she , and that the union was far too immediate after Priminger 's death . He also quite rightly reasoned that he was an outsider and that he would not have been welcomed even if he had n't latched on to the wealthy widow . And there was the problem of Priminger 's reputation as well . The dead did n't simply die in Red Springs . Reputations hung on . And if he was wealthy  --  as Priminger certainly was , and had  | a reputation that stretched from Red Springs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on with renewed life . So there was no need for the young Appalachian to have questioned anything . Mildred selected the time and the place , and it was the minister of her choice . The fact that he was bogus , to learn that the whole thing was based on fraud and deceit  --  well , that was something else . Ben intruded on his thoughts . " She said that 's why y'all got married in Lumberton . " " I went through that pretense b'cause I was a damn fool . I'da done better if I 'd done like a slave  --  a broomstick marriage . Jump over a broom an ' say you married . " " At least you had somethin ' . " " What 'd I have ? Charlotte was th ' love of my life . " It took forever to get it out , but he had to say it : " She was th ' love of mine too . " There would be no comment from the other man . Going back , maybe Charlotte was the one-sided love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own admission , he 'd never even had a life . And that was why , contrary to what she had hoped , Sweet Elsie Pratt never would have been a love . She would have been a companion , a warming companion , and he would n't have been lonely anymore . And neither would Moses . Silence came and stayed longer than both of them had wanted . It was up to Mr. Archy to take the lead . " Y'know somethin ' , Ben , " he said in a spirit of truce . " Lookin ' back , ai n't nothin ' been too pleasant in our lives . I mean , if y'think about it , we both should'a been hung . I also got a feelin ' there 's a whole lot more you ai n't tellin ' me . An ' I got a feelin ' it 's somethin ' I do n't want to know . I do n't want to know how a man who do n't know about birthin ' a baby can suddenly learn to cut th ' cord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't wan na know how he could do that alone  --  how he could do it on a night with so much rain pourin ' that he could hardly keep th ' kerosene lamp lit ; how he could come even close to doin ' anything like that without help from somebody much smarter than he is . I just want you to know that I 'm feelin ' somethin ' about th ' whole thing ca n't be right . But I made up my mind I ca n't be figger'n on things like that . It 's too big for me.  | An ' too late . Somebody , though , is gon na have to take it up with a power higher than me . " Ben looked away sullenly . He did not comment . " But gettin ' back to what I started to say , I had no business doin ' what I did , an ' you shore as hell didn ' have no right  --  or cause  --  to do what you did , an ' what I think you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty low in our lives . We ai n't got many of ' em left . That means we gon na be takin ' a trip soon  --  an ' at th ' end of that road there 's a man that 's gon na be sittin ' there , an ' we gon na have to face him . You know who he is , Ben ? " Ben said slowly , his mind elsewhere : " I do . " " We 're gon na be facin ' God , Ben . We 're gon na have to face God , face-to-face . Wonder what we gon na say ? What 're you gon na say to Him , Ben ? " Ben said nothing . " Say somethin ' , Ben . " Mr. Archy could have asked him a dozen more times , still he would have said nothing . Ben was amazing . Truly amazing . Here , Mr. Archy , in a most clear-cut fashion , all but told him that he knew there was complicity in Charlotte 's death . He was generous enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , preferring to leave it in God 's hands , and he spoke of his suspicions in the most conciliatory and accommodating way  --  but yet there was Ben , sitting there , swelling over something else Mr. Archy had said . He was not thinking of the gravity of the crime or the downright wrong of fostering someone 's death ; that did n't move him in the slightest . Ben sat there aiming his thoughts on what he considered an irony : " This man 's done changed , " he thought , meaning Mr. Archy . " At long last , this man is goin ' to say something to God . Not tell , say ! The white man do n't say anything to God . They tell God , just like they do with colored peoples . They tell , yell , shout . They order  --  cussin ' an ' haranguing : color 'd man do this ; color 'd man do that  --  God damn this ; God damn that . Orderin ' color'ds  --  an ' tellin ' God whatever and whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em everythin ' under th ' sun . The color'd 's , on the other hand , had nothing . They had  | absolutely nothing  --  and always beggin ' God . Every Sunday  --  an ' all through the week  --  mornin ' and night , on their knees  --  beggin ' . An ' somewhere now , still doin ' it ! Still at it  --  beggin ' and beseechin ' . Not tellin ' , not orderin ' . Beggin ' . An ' still ai n't got nuttin ' . " The old non churchgoer went on to think , with equal inappropriateness , that maybe , just maybe , that 's why when he was first introduced to the idea of joining the rest of the slaves in attending New Hope , thought that it was a rotten idea . To begin with , the church was misnamed . There coloreds had no hope  --  new or old , and he saw no reason that they would even bother to have those bi-weekly " freedom " meetings . Freedom did n't mean free . The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color . Old Ben concluded his thoughts by mulling over that final night . The church should not have been burned to the ground . Elsie was in there  --  not tellin ' , not orderin ' , she went in there bein ' color 'd . She went in there beggin ' . Beggin ' and besee-chin ' . He was sorry about what had happened . And he was sorry , too , that the week before he had been seduced by the storekeep 's kind words . Nice words from the man , an inquiry about the church , and a little piece of licorice . The white man did n't ask God , he told Him . And he burned His house to the ground . There was a body in His house  --  a plantation worker . And the plantation owner never even bothered to find out whose . " You might as well start talkin ' , Ben , b'cause we gon na have to tell Him something . It 's gon na be a long line , an ' we gon na have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na say , an ' we better start gettin ' ready now . We got ta chance to tell ' im that we did n't have time to let it grow , but we did plant th ' seeds for somebody . We was tryin ' to do good for somebody who d'serves it . We got ta chance to tell ' im we ai n't expectin ' to be let off th ' hook , but simply at the end we at least tried to do a little good for somebody . We can do that good startin ' now  --  through th ' boy . Now , I know , as wrong as I think you 've been in some things , you 've done y'best for ' im . An ' I know you ai n't just started doin ' it , an ' you ai n't just stay 'd on because of what Mildred  | put in them papers . You stayed on b'cause you was hurtin ' deep , down inside . You stay 'd on b'cause your conscience was hurtin ' you , ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head , but said nothing . " C'm on , now , Ben , it 's time to start tellin ' th ' truth . Am I righ ' or wrong ? You stay 'd because your conscience was hurtin ' , didn ' you ? " " I do n't know what to say , Mr. Archy . " " Well , then do n't say nothin ' . Sit there and do nothin ' . An ' then think about what choice you got if we do n't get t'gether an ' try an ' do somethin ' positive . " Ben surrendered . " I ai n't got ta go that far . I really made a'mess of things . " " An ' y'conscience 's been hurtin ' you . " " Killin ' me . " " An ' mine 's been hurtin ' me too . But we can start doin ' right for right 's sake  --  not for forgiveness , but because it 's right , " Mr. Archy said truthfully . He slid to the edge of his chair . " Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines is due in Fayetteville . They expect ' em any day , now  --  an ' y'know , some things like that is gon na r'volutionize the entire South . Th ' smart money is gon na gear up and gon na go with ' em . Ben , they gon na be right in a mighty big way . Now , I 'm askin ' you to forget about the past . It 's gone . All of it . If we really want to do some good for th ' last few sunsets , let 's do it for th ' boy . We can build this place up for ' im . We can build this place up for ' im so 's he can one day be one'a th ' biggest suppliers in all'a North Carolina  --  maybe the whole South . An ' the best thing about it is , plenty a'people can grow cotton , corn , soybeans , an ' all'a that . But they ca n't do what we can do . They ca n't produce th ' quality of tobacca like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything . Mr. Archy got closer with the chair . " Man , think about what I 'm sayin ' . We got somethin ' special here . We got th ' land  --  an ' we got a lil ' boy who 's got a mind that when he grows up can compete with anybody 's in the country . Ai n't nobody can touch ' im . Now , put two an ' two t'gether . Th ' boy supplyin ' th ' machines . First , an ' here 's why them machines is gon na be so big : They gon na be able to make  | chewin ' tabacca , pipe tobacca , cigarettes , cigars ; they gon na be able to pound snuff faster'n anythin ' known to man . Smokin 's here to stay , Ben . There 'll always be somebody somewhere with some kinda tobacca hangin ' in their mouths . If they ai n't chawin ' it , they 'll be smokin ' it  --  all over th ' world . They might even put tobacca in medicine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it spells one thing , Ben . One thing . Power . Whoever controls the fields in North Carolina controls the power . Now , I 'm askin ' you to f'get the past  --  it 's done with ; over , gone . " Now , I got news for you , Mildred , that Lumberton buffoon call 'd a preacherman an ' notary , and that clerk feller in Fayetteville . That whole fabrication over th ' land is so stupid , it 's downright laughable . This property could never  --  never leave my hands unless I wanted it to . Whether th ' marriage to Mildred was legal or not , it 's mine . All of it . We lived t'gether as man an ' wife . If you done it for seven years , a small thing called common law makes it legal . I lived with that woman for three or four times that amount . But , again , that 's over . Th ' land is in th ' boy 's name , an ' it 's gon na stay that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him in th ' proper way , but proper or not , it 's his . An ' it 's gon na stay his . An ' we gon na work it for ' im . We gon na fix it up for ' im . If you d'cide you got somethin ' better to do , then you go right ahead and do it . I know what I got ta do . And I 'm gon na do it . An ' whether I 'm able or not I 'm still gon na take these old bones a'mine an ' go out there an ' work the fields , an ' if I ai n't able to culta ' - vate but a foot of it , I 'll still be able to say to my son , Here , here 's wha'cha paw did for you . ' " Ben looked at him , " You 'd do that for th ' boy Mr. Archy ? " " I 'm gon na do it for my son . " " You ownin ' up to th ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownin ' up to my son , " Mr. Archy reemphasized . Ben grinned . " Lawdy , a'mercy , " Ben said to himself . He looked at Mr. Archy again and saw the urgent truth working . He wanted more confirmation . " Y'serious , Mr. Archy ? " " Never been more serious in m'life . " " An ' y'ai n't jus ' sayin ' it ? " " Sayin ' it for what ? How many more sunrises do I have left ? How  | many do you ? Moses is got a lifetime a'head of him . An ' that 's who we 're doin ' it for . " Ben got up and circled the porch and shot an eye back to the unlit bedroom window . " An ' you 'd done already made up y'mind t'give th ' land to th ' boy " " Every last inch of it . As God is my witness . " Ben 's circle grew wider , and he was talking more to himself : " Lawd , Lawd , Lawd , to think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Archy heard it . " He owns th ' land . An ' he ai n't a Priminger . How'n hell can a dead man father a child ? Th ' boy is a McBride . He 'll always be a McBride , an ' th ' way this McBride is gon na fix them papers , ai n't nobody on th ' face of this earth is gon na be able to take th ' land away " Mr. Archy was convincing and Ben could n't get over it . " Boy , that shore would be somethin ' . Good God , that would be sumthin ' . " He came back up on the porch and tried to temper himself . But he could n't . " Mr. Archy , I think you done hit it " " I know dang tootin ' we done hit it , Ben . " Mr. Archy said , stressing the we . More thought , and with his enthusiasm building again : " An ' y'say th ' place is gon na be built up for ' im ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ai n't no saint , but it 's up to God and his mama to be th ' judge . They up there . We 're down here . But to do what 's got to be done down here , I need your help . " Ben rolled the words around in his mind and looked at Mr. Archy , again seeing how serious the man was , and said : " Who 's gon na do th ' buildin ' ? " " Me an ' you . " " An ' who 's gon na work th ' fields ? " " Me an ' you . Side by side . " Ben knew that the man could n't make it out in the fields . " Now , Mr. Archy , you know you ca n't ? " " Hold it , Ben . I can try . I can give it all I got . That 's all any man can do . But we ai n't gon na fail th ' boy . We can start . An ' if an ' when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " On me , " Mr. Archy acknowledged . " We 'll wagon in some folks from Fayetteville . " " Mabbe out ' a Lumberton or Charlotte  --  maybe out ' a Rennert or Shannon , an ' there 's Raeford , an'a coupl'a more of them lil ' places in between . " " We 'll stick with th ' big stuff . But we gon na get it done . All we got ta do is get it fixed in our minds . Y'with me ? " Ben , by this time , had sat down and was standing again . He sat again , pictured it in his mind , and unnecessarily asked , " When we gon ' start ? " " Sooner than soon , " Mr. Archy said . Ben was now back standing and grinning again . Even though it was dark on the porch , it looked as if his few remaining teeth had pushed stain and hardship aside to sparkle one last time . Feeling good , Mr. Archy extended a hand , " We gon na do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na do it . " Ben held on to his hand much too hard and then vigorously shook it . " You bet'cha we is , Mr. Archy . You bet'cha we is " In their exuberance they never saw the boy peeping from the bedroom . If ever there was about to be a happy moment in a boy 's life , this was about to be it . When he saw Mr. Archy extend for the handshake , he put his little hands over his mouth to breathlessly wait to see what the uncle would do . It was a moment of high tension for him , and when the uncle acknowledged the handshake in what amounted to a new and lasting friendship , and then gave it that something extra , the boy did n't leap , he sprouted wings and levitated back to the bed . Landing safely , he hesitated for but a fraction of a second , and then he pounced , and rolled , and wiggled , and giggled , kicked his heels the air , thought about the clouds , offered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog , blew Sweet Elsie a kiss , promised to sweep the creek , slid under the covers , summoned the gang , put them on hold , came back up , hit the floor , spun around the room , looked for his horse , settled for a frog , and slipped under the quilt again , and  --  kerplunk . The world was at peace .  | It began as envisioned , and in the long days that followed  --  which stretched into weeks , the trio labored under a series of bright and rotating suns . Ben did not keep his normal sunup-to-sundown hours because he knew that the sheer mugginess of August alone would have been too rough on the former plantation owner . The old black man 's concern was totally justified . Daily Mr. Archy would be dressed in overalls and straw hat , looking like  --  and moving with  --  the speed of a stationary scarecrow , and even at that he would be puffing like a train in trouble . Neither he , Ben , nor the boy was certain as to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was supposed to have been in the area of clearing the fields , but , owing to Mr. Archy 's condition , Ben changed the plans to include building on an addition and restructuring the tired old place . Since it was easiest , Mr. Archy and the boy filled the first few days wagoning in the lumber from Lumberton while Ben busied himself with the sawing , hammering , and unloading chores . The questions and play had slowed from the boy because he was in a modest state of dazzled shock . For the first time in his life he had seen something other than the grounds of home : He had seen the nation at work and play , never dreaming that it could be so huge and active . Why , Lumberton ( population 21 ) had more people in it than they had in the whole wide world . And Fayetteville was bigger ? Lordy , Lord  --  Lord ! Mr. Archy promised Moses that he would take him to the big city ,  | and he would have been more than happy to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another day in the fields . And , too , there would be the added bonus of locating a few bookstores  --  and possibly a school that would eventually be of benefit to the boy . Moses had never been to Red Springs either , but had he and Mr. Archy changed routes and passed through there on that particular September morning he would have found Silas , the cane hobbler , J. D. , Shep , and one or two others already on the stoop , lazing to the early-morning sun . Silas , without troubling himself to move , yawned inside to McMillan , " Hurrup an ' roll that other barrel ou'cheer , Mac  --  I ca n't seem to rest right ' lessen I got m'foot prop't up on somethin ' . " " Maybe , " Shep said , " h'it 's ' cause you got that there foot people used to talk about . " " W'kinda foot is that ? " " Sidy folk 's foot , " said the cane hobbler . " H'its got one'a them hifalootin ' names " " A-letic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks that like to play them there games . " " A-letic , ' " the cane hobbler confirmed . " S'it " The barrel came out , and Silas , instead of getting up and moving out of the way , pulled his legs up and lazily waited for McMillan to place it in position . " I a-surnes  --  I said , I a-sumes we 'll be gettin ' some new pickles soon ? " McMillan went back into the store without comment . Tonic asked the cane hobbler : " Why 's of Mac all slick 'd up ? " " H'come you all slick 'd up ? " the cane hobbler hollered . McMillan hollered back out , " Goin ' to Fayetteville . Got ta restock . " " An ' while y'orderin ' this time , Mac , do n't forget my raisins ! " Silas hollered . " An ' be good e ' huff to think ' m ' feet . Bring m ' back some ' a them soft pickles " And there was an afterthought : " Hey , Mac , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to try standin ' in this thing one'a these days " Although Tonic had used the term , slick was not quite the way McMillan was dressed . But he did have on his Sunday best , which  | took on the form of an unpressed dingy off-white suit , capped by a crumpled fedora . " Wan na take a ride in with me , J. D. ? " He was outside now , hollering from the back . " Ca n't . " " Okra ? " " My feet 's too tired " " Doc ? " " Too much ridin ' f'me . I 'd be sorer'n a coon 's can by th ' time we got back in th ' mornin ' , " answered the cane-hobbler . " Tonic ? " " Like to , but I do n't trust your wheels . " McMillan did n't want him along anyway and only asked him because he was standing in his face . He tossed a few more empty sacks and jugs on the wagon , unhitched the mule , and led him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in wit'cha , " said Shep . " Good . Me an ' you always seem to light ' em up when we get there " " We th ' talk of the cat house , all right . Hee , hee , hee . So 's I can really put on th ' dog , maybe I should change first . " " Into what ? " inquired Silas . " It 's agin ' th ' law to ride naked . " When McMillan and Shep arrived in Fayetteville late that day , Epps , Austin , Wills , and the other old-timer who never said anything were engaged around a game of checkers . McMillan always made it a point to stop by the warehouse first because it used to be a solid place to do business . It was the one-stop of Fayetteville . Epps sold every-thing  --  from snuff to syrup , pins to plows , thread to rope , and without a doubt he could have still been in business had he not gotten caught by the glamour of the tobacco industry . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward them . " Ca n't kick . " " Need any sign paintin ' out yonder ? " " Not ' Chet . " " Wan na be lookin ' good for th ' new machines . "  | " They here yet ?

" " Ha , ha , ha " " Hairy . " " Likes it ? " " Lovzit . " " Haw , haw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McMillan and Shep did enjoy a brief stay . But it was not overnight . Again they went to Middie 's house of ill repute . As usual , they paid their money , selected two women , went to their individual rooms , laid there in vain , departed with excuses , and spent part of the night in a saloon . But the other part of the night would find the two on the road , speeding back to Red Springs like a bullet . Epps and the sign painter had come into the saloon and , amid good drinking , had bragged to the two visitors how they were getting set to  | sell tobacco products to some people in Raleigh , the state 's capital . McMillan and Shep did n't really know that Raleigh was the state 's capital , and trying not to appear too dumb , they switched the subject to everybody 's favorite topic , Archibald McBride . Misinterpreting everything , the two were told that Archy had come to town and went to the clerk 's office to secure information about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up to something . " Must'a been , " said the sign painter . " After he left , we went in an ' check 'd . Warren told us he ai n't got nothin ' in his name anymore . " " Must'a done gone plum ' loco , " said Epps . " H'gave some screw'd-up story ' bout him bein ' 011ie Priminger , " continued the sign painter . " Or th ' son of ' em " " Somethin ' like that . " " Is you sayin " ' McMillan digested " Archibald McBride was here tryin to tell th ' clerk he was somebody else ? " " Not only that , " said the sign painter , " but he done deeded all the property to his son . Whoever that is "  | If the man had never worked so hard and long in all of his natural life , and after the last wagon load , he was moving around like a punch-drunk fighter . Numbly , he would take a plank and do nothing but walk around in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would be a good idea if they put the house-mending chores on hold and sought lesser work in the fields . It was not a good suggestion . Even there the rigors of labor got to him , and soon he was on his knees . Seeing him , Moses skipped out for bright assistance . " H'ya doin ' , Mr. Archy ? " " Oh , fine , " the man said as he quickly started patting the ground as though he had lost something . " Wha'cha doin ' down there ? " " Jus ' ? jus ' lookin ' . " " Wha'cha lookin ' for ? " " Er . . . er  --  m'hammer . " " What would y'be doin ' with a hammer ou'cheer in th ' fields ' ? " " Oh , ha-ha-ha , never can tell wh'cha might have to nail up out here " " Ai n't tired , is you ? " " No , " said the all-but-exhausted man . " Takes more'n this t ' make this of workhorse tired . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Cause Unca Benny says that since  | we runnin ' a lil ' bit b'hind , we gon na have to stay ou'cheer ' til it gets dark . " " What ? " Mr. Archy shouted , and then caught himself and tried to disguise tragedy by easing into . " What I meant to say is , I 'm glad that he feels that way . It gives me somethin ' to look forward to " " Me too , " chimed the boy , and stood there waiting for the man to get up . Obviously they were not thinking the same thing . The boy just stood there for a while . He wanted to offer assistance , but he was n't sure it was wanted . Mr. Archy , conversely , wanted the boy to leave so that he could capture a few moments rest . For a while it was like a standoff , and when it appeared that the boy would outwait him , the man on the ground summoned the last of his energies , and then courageously but falsely said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grind . Nothin ' like a good day 's work , I allus say . " " I allus say th ' same thing . " " Good , son . Good " It was said with a good-bye ring , but the boy did n't catch it . " Any chance y'uncle got a lil ' somethin ' for you to do ? " " I 'll go see . But if you need anythin ' else , just call me " " Ha-ha-ha , I 'll be sure'n do that , " Mr. Archy said limply . The boy smiled and darted away . Mr. Archy hung an eye on him , and when it looked as though the coast was clear , he started to go down again . Suddenly the boy stopped and turned and delivered a friendly wave . It was returned , and though lacking in spirit , it was enough to send the boy farther on his way , but not too far , as Mr. Archy was quick to learn when he tried to go down again . The boy stopped , turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held for a moment , and down he went . Ben saw Mr. Archy when he went down and mercifully signaled quittin ' time . By the time Mr. Archy had struggled to his feet , the boy was on his way over to him again : " Whas'a'matter , Mr. Archy , don'cha wan na quit ? " The man was going around in circles . " S'quittin ' time , Mr. Archy , " the boy said , grabbing his hand . Mr. Archy still could n't hear him . " Mr. Archy ! S'quittin ' time ! "  | In slow registration , the head turned and reacted as if he were a witness to a slow but fading dream . " C'm on , Mr. Archy , " the boy said , now hand-holding him across the field . " Right this a ' way . " At about the halfway point , Ben met them with the wagon , climbed down , and helped the man up . " Y'kno somethin ' , Unca Benny , Mr. Archy didn ' even want'a stop . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was a small groan from the man collapsed in the back of the wagon . Somehow the groan contradicted everything the boy had said . When the wagon pulled into the yard , Mr. Archy was assisted down and led onto the porch . " Think you can make it now , Mr. Archy ? " asked the boy , itching to take care of the mule . " Oh , he 'll be all righ ' soon 's I rustle up a lil ' grub , " Ben answered . Mr. Archy opened an eye . " Er ... maybe , " he said , remembering Ben 's habits in the kitchen . " Maybe I 'd better skip eatin ' t'night , Ben " " Ca n't do that  --  good eatin ' is th ' onlyist thing that 'll keep you alive out in the fields . " Mr. Archy smiled wanly , unable to make up his mind as to which was worse : Ben 's kitchen or Ben 's fields . " Any chance of sumthin ' simple , like ham an ' eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You got ta have somethin ' that 's gon na stick to y'ribs . " It was a stiff Mr. Archy that sat at the table later that evening , stiff because of the bevy of aches and pains , and stiffer still because he was not sure as to how he would avoid eating what Ben had prepared . The kitchen was small and stuffy , and this had been a particularly humid night , and Mr. Archy could n't help but take note of the sweat that poured down from the dark forehead , slid down the chin , and continued on down into the cast-iron pot . It might have been dandy for the boy , but the former plantation owner could n't take another meal : " Got anythin ' to drink , Ben ? " " Oh , I might have a lil somethin ' . "  | It was like manna from heaven : Thank gawd , Mr. Archy said to himself . " Lord , " he said , coming alive , " I 've found my supper . " Ben removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burlap-wrapped package , opened it , and passed it under Mr. Archy 's nose . Mr. Archy took the bottle and chuckled . " Join me " Ben slid a self-made tin cup on the table . It was filled to the brim . Grinning , he took a nice belt and significantly handed the cup back to Mr. Archy , who , without the slightest bit of hesitation , downed the remaining contents . Ben cracked a broad smile , " You gon ' be all right after all . " " Hell , " said the renewed Mr. Archy , " that 's what I been tryin ' to tell you all along . " The boy came in and Ben helped him with the pail . Easing over to Mr. Archy , he cocked an eye on the bottle and cup . " Tonic , " said the man . " Smells like mash t'me . " Mr. Archy looked over at Ben . " Smart lil ' feller , ai n't he ? " " Takes after his daddy , " Ben said lightly . Mr. Archy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face went bland , and then it cracked in laughter . Afterward , he pushed back in his chair and smoothed the cup in thought . There were inner questions , but time would provide the answers . The important thing was that there was hope , and so far , over the past weeks , they had gotten off to a very good start . The man with the plan did not delude himself into thinking that there would be no problems , and that the dark recesses of his mind would henceforth be stilled . No , he had not been entirely purged ; no , he had not been entirely freed from the shackles of his own bondage  --  that was impossible , and the very fundamentals of life would constantly be urging and prodding and pulling him back to the old ways . But they would fail , and while he was not impenetrable , he was a man of strength ; and while the call of the old ways might weaken him in the days and few years ahead , he was certain they would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his had not been a further wreckage of life , but rather a start . And a good one it was , for all grievances were gone now , and that in itself was new . He thought  | about Charlotte and wondered what she would think . Here he was , sitting in Ben 's kitchen , united with the man who had destroyed her . He then looked at the boy , and tried to be fair . Earlier Ben had asked where would the boy be without him ; what would have happened had he not been around ? They were good questions , very good questions . Mr. Archy did not have  --  rather , Mr. Archy did not want to think of ? the answers . The old white man sitting in the kitchen sipping on the refreshments shuddered a bit and thought of something else : If Ben was all that much of a wicked and sinister man , if his deeds were so evil and corrupt , and the boy , having nothing  --  nothing  --  or no other single living human being around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach , to helm his eager young life , how could he have possibly grown to be as wonderful as he was ? How could he be as pure ? How could he be so unswerving in his devotion ? And as deserving as he was , how could his mother  --  wherever she was  --  how could she look down from on high and allow this good and precious child to love this leathered old black puzzle so much ? And then again , thought the father , God knows I 've not been a saint either . How could he think so highly of me ? When the meal was over , the boy gave his stomach the usual pats and complimented the cook . " Y'did it agin , Unca Benny . " Mr. Archy , sitting at the other end of the table with the untouched plate politely off to the side , refilled his cup . " Unca Benny did it agin , Mr. Archy . " " Done what , son ? " " Cook some mighty good eatin ' . " " You sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him , the untouched plate , his own , Ben 's , and he still could n't figure out what the man was talking about . Ben smiled and slid back from the table . " S'bout that time , son . " " No playtime , Unca Benny ? " " Not as early as we 's got ta get up in th ' mornin ' . " The boy looked at Mr. Archy . " You gon na get up early in th ' mornin ' too , Mr. Archy ? " " Son , I 'll be up an ' out'a here b'fore you even turn over good . "  | " Bet'cha wo n't . " " Bet'cha I will . " " No , y'wont . " " Okay , tell you what , b'fore we go to th ' fields , let 's see who beats who down to th ' creek in th ' mornin ' . " " Y'gonna race me to th ' creek ? " " I 'm gon na beat y'down to it . " The boy was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait . Ben started to usher him to the lone room , but Mr. Archy , in a more serious tone , told Ben to hold off . " ' C'mere , y'cuddly lil ' rascal . You know , you 're one prince of a human bein ' " He then made wide gestures with his arms : " Son , " he began seriously , " all this is yours . Everythin ' . Everythin ' in here , everythin ' out there  --  everythin ' up to and beyond th ' creek  --  yours " " Whose ? " " Yours . " " Mine ? " He did n't get the full significance , but it sounded good . " Yours . An ' one day you gon na make h'story with it . Y'gonna be sharin ' your story with people , tellin " em about these days , Music 's gon na be playin ' , you gon na be runnin ' ' round the capitol there in Raleigh , you 're gon na be all gussied up , sportin ' a derby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , drinkin ' an ' sharin ' y'cognac , toppin ' it off with champagne " " Whas all'a that ? " " Champagne ? Only th ' finest drink th ' world has ever known . You drink it on special occasions  --  for special people , r'served for kings , lords , and princes  --  an ' anybody you think d'serves special treatment . " Ben did n't know what it was either , but led the boy in feeling good . " But what 's important  --  an who is important is an ' is always gon na be You . " " Me ? " " Right . An ' for a while longer , y'uncle Benny an ' me . We love you , son , an ' we want you to have th ' best . We want you to have all'a this , an ' we want you to grow up an ' be able to look back on these here  | days an ' this here place with fondness and love , an ' look back on us as two old men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so 's you can keep this here place " Ben took a long swallow and joined in ? " an ' so 's you can keeps it , you gon na be one'a th ' first color'ds to ever learn to read ' n write . " " I is ? " " Yessuh . Mr. Archy 's gon na see to that . " " An ' when you 're ready , we 're gon na start thinkin ' about the big schools , maybe in Raleigh . Maybe up north . Philadelphia , I say Philadelphia because it 's the cradle of American history . It was even th ' capitol sixty to seventy-five years ago . But I want you to go there . Learn . Go to great places like that . It 's a mighty big world out there " Ben said , " An ' one day , after you seen it , I want you to do somethin ' for me I always want 'd . Now , I ca n't read one , but I always wan-t 'd somebody to write to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I do n't care if it 's a letter , or note , or just a plain piece'a paper sayin ' h'lo , unc'l Ben , ' I want it . I do n't care how or when I get it as long 's I get it . An ' I want it from you . An ' I do n't care where I 'm at , see that I get it . An ' if you got it in you at all , write what 's in your heart . A good story is allus cared in th ' heart . But if you ca n't do that , drop me a note . I 'd love it just as much . Do that for your unc'l Benny . Thas ' all I want . " The boy , like Ben , was looking ever so serious . " An ' when you write to him , mention me . " The boy vigorously nodded his head to both of them . " An ' for yourself , I want you t'learn your hist'ry . Learn ev'body 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ben said , importantly remembering good counseling : " A black man without hist'ry is like a bird without wings  --  walkin ' when they ough t 'a be flyin ' . Y'undastans ? Walkin ' when they ough t 'a be flyin ' . Do n't you be in that po'sition . An ' , son , please please do n't grow up t'be like me ? " " Or me either , " Mr. Archy interrupted . " You wo n't undastan 's it now , but one day you will . An ' while you learnin ' , do n't question God , listen . An ' always , always try to be right in whatever you do . An ' if you do that , you 'll never never know th '  | thing that d'stroys a man inside out : a bad conscience . Both me an ' y'uncle Benny suffers from that " " We ai n't been as good as we shudda , son , " Ben added . " But we ai n't been as bad as we could ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our wrongs . " Again , not understanding the philosophy , the boy nodded his head in vigorous agreement . " But , now , listen to me , son , ' cause this is just as ' mportant : North Carolina has got somethin ' to offer th ' world . We want you t'have somethin ' to offer North Carolina . This is God 's country . You ai n't gon na find nothin ' no better , " the old son of a Scot said , continuing to show that he had more than an awareness of God and , for the first time acknowledging that he loved the land . It caused the boy to feel even better . It was all so wonderful , all so real and true . " What we been doin ' ' round here , " Mr. Archy continued , " is tryin ' t'start build-in ' this place up  --  for you . An ' when we done , an ' we got the whole place lookin ' like we want it to look , you know who th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But neither Ben nor the boy could spell . Mr. Archy quickly picked up : " See , that 's why y'have to have learnin ' ? Y-o-u spells you ! You is gon na be boss man " " Meeeeeeeee ? Boss man ? " " You . Boss man . " " Boss Man Moses " Already dizzy with the onslaught of information and promises made , the boy was swept away . " But , now , son , " Ben stepped in advisedly , " when you grows up  --  in fact , you do n't even have to grows up  --  all you got to do is be who you is , an ' you gon na have enemies . An ' them enemies can be poison . " " Rotten , " added Mr. Archy . " Don ' even call ' em by their names just call ' em thems . ' An ' them thems can put a hurtin ' on you . Watch ' em like a hawk . Keep y ' eyes on ' em . " " They 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' weeds in th ' fields out there , cuttin ' an ' chokin ' everythin ' off  --  not lettin ' th ' good  | stuff grow . They ai n't got no purpose in life , an ' God Himself ca n't seem to stomp ' em out . " " Ca n't even burn ' em out , " Ben added . " But we countin ' on you to never let ' em best you " Mr. Archy continued . " Even if you have to take ' em to heart an ' kill ' em with kindness , do n't let ' ' em pull you under . Find a way t'deal with ' em . There 's always mor'n one way to skin a rat . " " An ' rats is what they is . " " An ' when you finish 'd dealin ' with ' em , look ' em in th ' eye , an ' let ' em know th ' boss man did it . " " Don ' let ' em take nothin " way from you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Use y'mind , son . Th ' mind . Always use y'mind . Be clever . Very , very clever . That 's what any McBride will do " The boy did n't quite get the full implication . But in his own way he promised himself right then and there , he would always use the mind to serve them well . Ben clarified : " You one'a them " " I 'm a McBride ? " " You 're the McBride , " Mr. Archy said . " An ' if I 'd had any sense about it at th ' time , your mother would'a been a McBride " But the boy was too centered on the great news . He swallowed again . " I 'm a McBride ? With two names ? " " With two names . " " I 'm Moses McBride ? " And before the question could be answered , he was gone , too dizzy and breathless to continue . He simply could n't take any more . In his room , unlike the last time , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't use birdlike power to get into the room . He spun , airylike . He did n't pounce on the bed , he melted  --  and with the slowness of syrup in winter , he oozed under the quilt . Lord , Lord , Lord , he was the happiest , the most gladdened , the most joyous , the most tickled somebody in the whole wide world . The boy had reason to be at his height . He was living beyond a dream . He was a McBride ; he had two names ; he was a boss man ; he was cuddly ; he was a prince ; he owned land ; he had a creek ; he was 4  | going to learn how to read and write ; he would one day learn history , go places , drink champagne , and dress like the governor  --  whatever that was . But the benefits of living went on and on . And everything-everything  --  every single solitary thing in life was because of Uncle Benny and now Mr. Archy  --  buddies . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to each other . Ben and Mr. Archy there , touchable , talking , giving  --  giving everything they had to him  --  giving him a universe , and all they wanted in return was for him to grow and make a contribution , to use the mind , to be wary of the weeds of life , and write them a note . Good God Almighty . There was a man beyond the clouds . There had to be . Oh , how he wished he knew how to thank Him . Back in the kitchen , neither of the two men were overly wrought with pain . Mr. Archy had been liberal in his drinking , and Ben was coming on strong . The situation , and what they had said to the new boss man , had them feeling even better about themselves , and Mr. Archy said , hoisting the cup , " I think this calls for a small c ' lebration " They touched cups , and threw their heads all the way back  --  and the heads did not return upright until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , and Ben unsteadily arose from the table . " Arch , m'boy , we might as well keep it rollin ' . " " Y'mean , y'got some more ? " Ben nodded and weaved over to the shelf and pulled down another pail and showed the man two more bottles . Mr. Archy grinned : " An ' all th ' while I thought you was over here sufferin ' . " Ben unwrapped the corn shucks from around the bottles and said , " An ' all th ' while I thought you was over there ' njoyin ' y'self . " Mr. Archy slid the cup aside and went straight for a bottle . " Y'ever know a lonely man to ' njoy himself ? " " I never know 'd a lonely man " " You knew me " " Let 's drink to th ' lonely ! "  | They found about eight different things to toast . Time passed and the solid drinking continued . Both men were reeling in that good and high state of mind , and when one dozed off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a way to bring him back . " Ben , m'boy . I wouldn ' mind a lil ' cognac . " " An ' cone-ee-yakee is , Mr. Archy ? " . " A lil ' sumthin ' t'keep th ' heart pumpin ' " " I 'll have to put that one on m'list , " Ben said as he stood by the shelf , peering up and getting ready to invade his private peach jars . " Cone-ee-yakee . " " S'good stuff , Ben " " Bet it is , suh , but I 'm fresh out . Anythin ' else that a man like me would have handy ? " " On all great occasions we should have some'a that champagne I was talkin " bout . Y'aint liv 'd ' til you had it . " " Gon na have t'put that one on order too , " Ben said , and then came up with what he thought was a sensational idea : " Arch , let 's change bottles ! " " Great idea , Ben , " Mr. Archy said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete . When that was done , Mr. Archy said : " I got
