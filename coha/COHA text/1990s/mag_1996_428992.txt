ALF THE EARTH will harvest a total lunar eclipse on the night of September 26-27 , when the " harvest Moon " is cropped by the Earth 's shadow . This is the full Moon closest to the date of autumnal equinox , which this year falls on September 22nd . Named for the help it provides in getting the harvest home , autumn 's harvest Moon offers two or three nights of early evening light to hard-working farmers still bringing in the sheaves after sundown . In spite of the Moon 's eastward progress in its orbit , it rises close to the same time on each of these nights and appears before darkness requires you to throw in the sickle . Normally the daily delay in moonrise conspires against the swing shift , but around the fall equinox the angle between the horizon and the Moon 's path is seasonably shallow in midnorthern latitudes . Autumnal equinox occurs when the Sun crosses below the celestial equator . The equator 's blue arc curves through the southern half of our all-sky map on pages 62 and 63 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sun occupies on September 22nd can not appear on our star map , but you can locate it on the chart for the Sun , Moon , and planets on pages 66 and 67 . On the night of the eclipse the Sun will still be near its equinox position . Because the full Moon is opposite the Sun , the other intersection of the celestial equator and the Sun 's path ( the green ecliptic arc on the monthly sky chart ) is close to where we 'll find the full Moon this month , in the constellation Pisces , the Fishes . No matter how many encores we croon of " Shine on , Harvest Moon , " this year our satellite is going to pull the plug on any agricultural overtime . It will rise partially eclipsed over at least some of those amber waves of grain in the western half of the United States and Canada . A total lunar eclipse near the time of equinox tells us something else about the disposition of the Moon . Lunar eclipses can occur only when the Sun and Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path pierces the plane of Earth 's orbit around the Sun . Because the sky is cultivating a near-equinox eclipse , we know that the nodes must be near the equinoctial junctions . As the Moon 's orbit precesses in response to Newton 's laws , the nodes migrate westward in an 18.61-year cycle . Where they wind up on the ecliptic affects the angle between the Moon 's orbit and the celestial equator . That , in turn , modifies the monthly extremes of the moonrise point along the eastern horizon . Traveling on a trail tilted to the celestial equator , the Moon treks north , south , and back again , mimicking in a month what the Sun achieves in a year . Moreover , the precessing orbit makes the Moon 's monthly limits advance and retreat in the same cycle as the nodes . Once every 18.61 years the Moon undergoes its greatest excursions in declination . The northernmost moonrise is then well north of the point of midsummer sunrise , and the southernmost moonrise occurs farther south than any sunrise in winter . A half cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the celestial equator and the monthly limits of moonrise are much closer together . Although these two configurations confine the Moon between entirely different frontiers , both occur only when the nodes are near the equinox directions . In 1996 the Moon is near its tighter , inner limits - now trapped between the ecliptic and the celestial equator . The geometry steepens the path of the rising Moon and diminishes the harvest Moon 's effect , albeit subtly . So even without that total lunar eclipse , this year 's astronomical advantage to agriculture is not all it 's cracked up to be . Photograph // The term solstice has been used by almanac makers for centuries . Its Latin roots mean " Sun still " and refer to the way the sunrise and sunset points seem to linger for several days at their northern or southern extremes . Although we have no traditional name for the occasional stretches of many months when the Moon repeatedly attains the inner and outer limits of its monthly excursion , studies of astronomical alignments in prehistoric monuments in Europe led Alexander Thom to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outer limits the major standstill and the inner limits the minor standstill . Before Thom contrived his vocabulary of excursion in his book Megalithic Lunar Observatories , the possible significance of standstill Moon alignments was popularized and promoted by astronomer Gerald S. Hawkins in Stonehenge Decoded . Hawkins , like Thom and C. A. Newham , first identified astronomical targets in terms of telltale declination angles above or below the celestial equator - a perfectly reasonable search strategy . But the alignments themselves , like those Hawkins spotlighted at Stonehenge , were embedded in the landscape , not in the celestial sphere . If the builders of those antiquities were actually designing astronomy into their architecture , they were observing where objects like the Sun and Moon rose and set and were not necessarily throwing a grid upon the sky to map their movements against abstract coordinates . Actually , the first lunar line in a prehistoric monument was suggested in 1912 by T. Boyle Somerville , a British rear admiral who surveyed the standing stones of Callanish in Scotland 's Outer Hebrides and identified a pair of stones aligned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skepticism about such lunar orientations , but in the wake of Hawkins and Thom the Moon 's role has been investigated at other ancient sites far from Stonehenge . Hawkins himself proposed standstill alignments in Egyptian temples at Karnak . Anna Sofaer , Rolf Sinclair , and J McKim Malville advocate standstill significance in the Pueblo architecture of the ancient Southwest . John A. Eddy and William Romain have pointed out lunar potential in the Hopewell mounds of prehistoric Ohio . Despite these lunar alignments , other researchers are skeptical that anyone in antiquity was interested in the monthly limits of the Moon . These limits remain controversial in part because the motivation for paying attention to them is not clear . Thom 's argument linking them to eclipse prediction has n't withstood analysis . But archaeologist Aubrey Burl has presented a fetching case for ritual lunar alignments in a type of stone ring found in northeast Scotland . There , he believes , a recumbent stone flanked by a pair of commanding uprights may have provided a ceremonial stage for the low southern Moon , especially at the standstills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standstill southern Moon at the Castle Fraser ring , but we were washed out by the wettest weekend endured by Scotland in 15 years . // When the Moon 's orbit creates the greatest angle between it and the celestial equator , the Moon 's monthly limits of rising and setting achieve their greatest reach . From outside the celestial sphere at this time the daily path of the Moon at its most northern and southern arcs would look something like the trails above in red . And if you watch the Moon for 9.3 years afterward , you will see the monthly excursion of moonrise and moonset gradually diminish until the Moon 's monthly limits are minimized ( blue ) .

We find it in the written traditions of Babylonia , China , and the classical world . Hipparchus , for example , knew in the second century B.C. that the Moon 's path shifts . Yet the traditional folk calendars based on the Moon 's actual behavior make it hard to believe earlier peoples had n't noticed the peregrinations of the Moon along the horizon . The Germanic tribes of northern Europe monitored the position of the Moon with respect to the Earth 's shadow , and archaeologist John Barber reports that mountain farmers in southwest Ireland have a Gaelic word for the time when the Moon 's nightly path is so low that it remains hidden behind hills And horizon behavior , after all , is what the harvest Moon is all about . Last May , I mentioned that Venus would then reach its northernmost setting in an eight-year cycle . Now , with a minor standstill , the year has added the inner limits of the Moon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northern edge of the minor standstill envelope by stalking December 's full Moon on the 24th , just three days after the Sun hits its southern limit on the solstice . This is your early warning to take it to the limit one more time . Author Affiliation E.C .
