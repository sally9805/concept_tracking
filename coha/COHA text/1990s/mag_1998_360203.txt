The main reason living standards have improved so much in the 20th century is that businesses have become so much more productive . And it is managers who have helped drive that evolution . The great ones do more than just run things efficiently ; they develop and put into practice ideas that transcend their company , their industry , even their national borders . Their ideas survive to become vocabulary in the halls of management and often in society at large . <P> Alfred Sloan literally wrote the book on managing large organizations  --  My Years with General Motors . No large company is untouched by his concept of decentralized management . He came into a GM that was cash short , chaotic and nearly bankrupt  --  Ford had a 60% market share  --  and brought discipline to a sprawling company , clearly defining the issues of planning , strategy and organization . He mastered the concept of market segmentation  --  Chevrolets for Everyman , Cadillacs for the wealthy  --  to better target GM 's sales and avoid internal competition , a strategy that left Ford behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight " by visiting Ford dealers incognito to learn about buyer behavior and competitive offerings . <P> At the beginning of the 1980s , 45-year-old Jack Welch became CEO of another giant , General Electric . Farsighted , incisive  --  and controversial  --  he recognized the threat of competition from Japan and elsewhere and had the intellectual and emotional strength to deal with it . He set the tone for U.S. industry . GE became highly productive by undertaking a complex reorganization that simplified the company into one with dominant positions in its carefully chosen businesses . Welch then remade GE into a boundaryless organization that encouraged , and got , participation from employees at all levels . He extinguished turf wars and the not-invented-here syndrome that stultifies large companies . And he spread the wealth with stock options . It was a monumental accomplishment in a company of GE 's diversity and size . He was the force behind GE 's Crotonville leadership-development center at Ossining , N.Y .  --  No. 1 in the world , a veritable CEO greenhouse . That 's another reason why GE is so widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Coca-Cola , proved that there is no such thing as a mature business . His critical insight was an ability to define exactly what business Coke was in  --  a task that is far harder than you think . For instance , he taught his executives that when they set goals for market share , they needed to focus on the share of stomach , not the share of carbonated beverages . His adversary was water , not soda . By this definition , Coke 's 40%-plus market share became 3% , changing the company 's view of growth . He then redefined the term global for a company that was already seemingly everywhere . By 1997 he pushed Coke 's overseas profits up to nearly 80% of total earnings , from 65% . This global view was reflected in people too . Goizueta gave real meaning to the word diversity , developing a multinational talent pool . He also became an avid disciple of the idea of economic value creation  --  a gauge of success that eliminates accounting gimmicks . He used it to create more value in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
