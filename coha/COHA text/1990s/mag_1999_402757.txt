The space calendar for 1999 looks eerily like the one for 1998 , with the troubled International Space Station and a number of astronomy missions suffering delays over the past few months . The coming year also features a renewed assault on Mars , with no fewer than four missions active around our neighbor planet . // Mars " Attacked " As 1999 begins , Mars Global Surveyor has resumed its once-per-orbit dipping into the red planet 's atmosphere , a process ( termed aerobraking ) that lowers the spacecraft 's altitude without using fuel . By March the craft 's orbit should be circular and about 400 kilometers high . This path will run almost directly from pole to pole and be Sun synchronized , such that the landscape below can be mapped at the same local time on each successive orbit . Only then will the MGS craft  --  which reached Mars on September 12 , 1997 - be able to begin its intended mapping mission . The space year will be inaugurated on January 3rd by the departure of Mars Polar Lander ( MPL ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heels of the Mars Climate Orbiter , launched the previous month , MPL should arrive at the planet 's south-polar ice cap next December . As it approaches Mars , the MPL craft will release a pair of Deep Space 2 penetrators . These 2-kilogram probes will bury themselves in the ground to conduct surface studies . Unlike the Mars Pathfinder mission , MPL has no airbags - it relies instead on a retrorocket system at touchdown like the one used by the Viking landers in 1976 . In September , the Mars Climate Orbiter ( MCO ) joins Global Surveyor in orbit around the red planet . MCO will use aerobraking as well as rockets to reduce its speed and circularize its path . The final orbit , also Sun synchronous , will be achieved in early December , in time to be used as a radio relay for the lander at the south pole . The Mars Climate Orbiter 's main mission is to study Martian weather . Meanwhile , Japan 's Nozomi probe , launched last July , reaches Mars in October 1999 . The probe will fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of 150 km . No aerobraking is planned , so Nozomi will spend most of its time much further from the planet than NASA 's orbiters . The focus of Nozomi 's international payload of instruments is how the solar wind and interplanetary gas affect the fringes of the Martian atmosphere . The planet 's weak magnetic field offers much less protection against solar-wind encroachment than ours does , nor does it form trapped belts of charged particles or auroras . Other Interplanetary Probes In January the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft completes its three-year journey to minor planet 433 Eros and takes up a close orbit around it . Another asteroid mission , Deep Space 1 , was launched in October 1998 and should fly past minor planet 1992 KD in July if its experimental ion drive is successful . In February , NASA 's Stardust space probe will be sent into orbit around the Sun . Stardust will fly past Comet 81P/Wild 2 in 2004 and return to Earth with a sample of comet dust two years later . Japan 's sole scientific launch of the year will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Japan has flown spacecraft past the Moon before , but Lunar A will be its first to achieve orbit there . The 520-kg probe carries a set of " penetrator " rockets , which will be fired at the lunar surface to punch instrumentation deep into the dusty regolith . In August the Saturn-bound Cassini/Huygens probe swings past Earth at a distance of 1,000 km to pick up speed before heading off to the outer solar system . Finally , in October the Galileo spacecraft will complete its four-year exploration of the Jovian satellite system with a close pass of the volcanic moon Io . Astronomical Satellites Six Earth-orbiting astronomy missions are scheduled for launch in 1999 . The Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite ( SWAS ) was placed in storage several years ago when its Pegasus launch vehicle ran into problems . In mid-1998 NASA managers gave the go-ahead to reactivate the program , and the SWAS team began racing to meet a December launch slot . However , that now seems likely to slip into January , following more problems with Pegasus . SWAS is to study long-wavelength emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacecraft Nozomi ( formerly Planet B ) acquired this image of the Moon during a close swing-by last September 24th . In October the spacecraft reaches Mars to study the interaction of the planet 's magnetic field with the solar wind .

An acronym for " A Broadband Imaging Xray All-sky Survey , " ABRIXAS will make the first high-resolution studies in " hard " ( very high energy ) X-rays , thus complementing the " soft " X-ray survey done by its predecessor , Rdntgensatellit ( Rosat ) . This marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former East and West Germanies . The Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer ( FUSE ) will take over Pad 17A at Cape Canaveral as soon as the smoke clears from Mars Climate Orbiter 's departure and ride its Delta rocket into orbit in February . The Wide Field Infrared Explorer ( WIRE ) is the next astronomy mission in the Pegasus queue . Like SWAS , it is part of NASA 's Small Explorer program . Once it reaches orbit in March , WIRE will study the sky at midinfrared wavelengths . The biggest astronomy mission of the year will be the Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility , now scheduled to ride the Space Shuttle Columbia sometime in the early spring . AXAF 's launch was delayed twice because ground testing took longer than expected . Once the spacecraft is safely in orbit , engineers at the AXAF control center will spend a couple of months checking and calibrating the observatory 's systems . If all goes well , its long-awaited studies of the high-energy cosmos will begin during the summer . For the first two months of observations , AXAF will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its images , and at the Cassiopeia A supernova remnant and the Coma cluster of galaxies , both of which have been well studied by other satellites . Two additional months of observations will be made by scientists directly involved with the AXAF program before the telescope is put into the service of astronomers worldwide ( for example , I 'll be using it to look at the nearby galaxy Messier 33 ) . In 1996 the High-Energy Transient Experiment was placed in orbit , but this X-ray satellite was unable to separate from its rocket stage . A replacement , HETE 2 , has been built at MIT from spare parts and is due to fly in October . The design of the experiment , which is intended to locate gamma-ray bursts , has been improved following the recent successes in this field with BeppoSAX and other satellites ; an extrasoft X-ray imager has joined the payload . Other flights initially scheduled for 1999 have been postponed . The European Space Agency 's X-ray Multi-Mirrror ( XMM ) mission has slipped a few months , while the SpektrumX-Gamma observatory remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be ready for at least two years . Nevertheless , barring accidents it looks as if 1999 will be a busy year that clears the backlog of astronomy satellites waiting for their ride to space .
