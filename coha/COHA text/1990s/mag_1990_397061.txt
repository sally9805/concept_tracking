Par 2001 : Scientific breakthroughs to keep your balls warm and your putter straight . <p> For a game which rests on the bedrock of good sportsmanship and honesty , golf is played by a bunch of cheaters . <p> Well , maybe " cheaters " is a bit harsh . Let 's say " strivers for an edge , " or " searchers for a secret , " or " tiptoers on the edge of legality . " Whatever , most golfers are ever alert for some kind of device , or teaching aid , or idea that will help their game . Something that will carve those last few strokes off the handicap and allow consistent victory in the bloody battles of the weekend Nassau . <p> It is this unending search for golf 's Holy Grail that fuels an entire golf technology industry . <p> And here are some of its outstanding product achievements . Devices , gimmicks , clubs and balls  --  some of them heated  --  that are guaranteed to help you hit straighter and longer , drain putts from every corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another golf match again as long as you live . Maybe . HIGH-TECH , HIGH TOUCH <p> The Sony CaddyCam is a self-contained video camcorder and color monitor . You just wheel it out to the backyard and film a few of your swings . On playback , in slo-mo or freeze frame , it 's easy to see where your swing is breaking down . For information call 201-930-7075 . <p> Of course , the Sony costs $3,500 , and you could spend up to $23,000 on the Video Analyzer II sold by Miya Epoch , the U.S. distributor for Miyamae Ltd. of Japan . The VA II has two video cameras for front and overhead views , a 29-inch split-screen monitor , and a computer to analyze each swing . In Calif. call 213-320-1172 ; otherwise 800-228-6594 . <p> More reasonable are the compact , battery-operated swing analyzers on the market . These are portable , about the size of a VCR , and can be used indoors or out . <p> Miya Epoch also offers the Shot Analyzer , which uses photosensors to capture data on clubhead speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You make a pass across a rubber surface either with or without a ball . Then , after each swing , the machine tells you whether your clubface is open , closed or square at impact ; if you hit the ball on the sweet spot , toe or heel ; and how far the ball would carry under normal conditions . It can be programmed for any club from driver down to pitching wedge and putter . <p> The Shot Analyzer retails for $229 and can be found in The Sharper Image stores . Bridgestone Sports USA , another Japanese-owned company , markets a similar product called the Science Eye Handy 01 . A special metallicized magnet affixed to the end of your club enables the electronic circuitry to provide instant information on clubhead speed , angle and direction at impact . Again , this machine spits out estimated distance on each swing , depending on the club you use . <p> The Science Eye costs $100 and is found at various golf retailers . OF HUMAN BONDAGE <p> Somewhere along the way , golfers were told that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists from breaking down , or their heads from coming up . So the golf gimmick industry responded by bringing to market what can best be described as devices that would float the boat of the Marquis de Sade . <p> There are , for example , the Swing Link ( $24.95 ) , a canvas-and-velcro strap that pins the upper arms to the chest ; the Clyde Guide and Arm Guide ( $14.95 ) , which uses metal rods to keep the forearms , arms , and shoulders locked in place in the chipping and putting strokes ; and the Wrist Lock ( $4.95 ) , which slips into the golf glove and immobilizes one 's wrist completely . <p> Do these things really have any beneficial effects ? Maybe , but look at it this way : if these bondage devices do n't work on improving your game , you can always use your imagination . You will find these kinky items , and many others , in the Golfworks catalog , 800-848-8358 . TEMPO FUGIT <p> Most golf instructors teach the importance of tempo in the golf swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fully releases energy at just the right moment : when club meets ball . <p> To help teach the feeling of maintaining tempo anti releasing the club at me bottom , many turn to training devices such as the Swingrite ( $49.95 ) . <p> This driver has a weighted mechanism in the head which " clicks " audibly at the moment that the Wrists release . If you 're swinging from the top , or swinging too early or too late , the Swingrite will tell you . <p> Look for this item in the Golfworks catalog . PUTTING ON THE RITZ <p> If it 's true that one drives for show and putts for dough , and that fully 40% of your strokes in an average round are made on the green , why do n't golfers spend more time practicing putting ? Because it 's boring to stand there for hours trying to sink putt after putt . <p> The pros , of course , do n't necessarily try to sink putts when they practice . Instead , they work on aspects of their putting strokes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use a simple training aid like the Putt Square ( $18.50 ) , a T-squared guide that rests on the green and helps align stance to target at address . <p> At the opposite end of the spectrum , there 's the Bridgestone Science Eye Putter ( $7,000 to $10,000 . ) With video combined with photoelectric sensors , you can get a multi-image snapshot of each nanosecond of your stroke . At the moment these are only available in Japan , but as a service to FYI readers , Bridgestone Sports USA 's chief operating officer Hank Rojas says , " If you gave me $10,000 , I 'd probably make sure you got one . " Thanks , Hank ! Bridgestone : 800-358-6319 . HOT NEW STICKS <p> Every year there 's a hot new club that everybody 's got to have . Of all people , Player of the Century Jack Nicklaus is mainly responsible for this year s hot stick : the J 's Driver . Seems Jack was playing in Japan earlier this year with Japanese pro Jumbo Ozaki , who was regularly out-driving him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nicklaus said something on the order of " Sacre bleu ! " which Ozaki took to mean " let me have a whack with one of those . " <p> Armed with Jumbo 's driver , Nicklaus once again begar , smacking 290-yard drives , just like he did when he was 20 years old . Raymond Floyd also got his hands on one , and almost won this year 's Masters with it . <p> Faster than you can say " build a better mousetrap. , " Bridgestone Sports went into overtime production on the new driver , which is now available in pro shops at about $400 . <p> Of note , too , for traveling hackers : Tamrac Inc. is now manufacturing the Vantix retractable golf clubs , which , in their carrying case , fit neatly into the overhead luggage rack of an airplane . You can break one of these babies out , and keep your swing tuned while you wait for the rest of your bags to arrive . Cost : $1,100. 818-715-0090 . INDOOR GAMES <p> If you live in a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to come home every night and practice , you could furnish the great room with video , hitting nets , and carpeted , undulating putting areas . But this might have a deleterious effect on your Significant Other . <p> There are some simpler solutions . The Swing Memory ( $79.95 ) attaches to any wall , and its weighted practice shaft , connected to a swiveling rod , reinforces the proper swing plane and arc . Five minutes a day is said to cure a host of swing ills . Available from the Golfworks catalog . <p> The Swing Plane Trainer ( $39.95 ) is a shaft with flashlights projecting beams of light from each end . This allows you to constantly check the alignment of the swing plane from beginning to end . Available from Swing 's the Thing Golf Schools , 800-221-6661 . <p> You might also consider the Perfect Swing Trainer , an arresting-looking contraption made with PVC pipe . Standing inside the adjustable tubular hoops , you make golf swings while maintaining contact with the rings . This helps you put the perfect swing plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Swing Trainer will cost you from about $500 to $900 for a customized set . 800-456-8082 . <p> Probably the simplest and most effective indoor training aid is the ASSIST ( All Season Self-Improvement Swing Trainer ) . This funky-looking club has a special training grip to show you where all the fingers are supposed to go ; a weighted , hollow , tubular head ; and a bent and twisted shaft . " Bent and twisted shaft ? " Do n't laugh : it helps build up the right muscles , develop a full extension , and promote the proper wrist action . Not bad for just $49.95 . Available from Golf-works and golf stores everywhere . BACKYARD PRACTICE <p> If you want to graduate beyond the chipping  --  a  --  few  --  balls  --  around  --  the  --  backyard stage , you 'll need to invest in a good hitting net . String it up in front of the garage door , between two trees , or buy one that stands by itself . They 're priced from $40 on up to over $200 for convenient , quick-retract models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need the Tee Wizz ( about $80 ) , an automatic ball loader . The gadget holds about 50 balls , and when you tap the control switch with your club , a metal arm comes down and places a ball on the tee for you . Now that 's service . It 's available in many golf stores . <p> If you do n't want to spend money on a net , fork out about $4 for some Short Flyte balls . They 've got a solid core wrapped in foam rubber . When you hit them , you hear that solid , satisfying " click . " You can also make them hook or slice . But  --  the best part  --  they do n't go more than 30 yards , even hit on me screws with me driver . The foam rubber makes windows , pets and children safe from shanks . Available from the Golfworks catalog . THE LONG AND SHORT ABOUT BALLS <p> I sent away for a dozen of those mail-order " hot " balls . the ones that ca n't be named because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf courses in the world instantly obsolete . <p> Frank Thomas of the U.S. Golf Association , who specializes in determining the legality of all of these items , calls the balls " snake oil , " and he 's right . I played with the Condor Gold ( giving my opponents full disclosure ) and noticed no real advantage . I never hit one 400 yards . Or 300 yards . I noticed a little " juice , " but nothing perceptibly different from any other ball . <p> Of much more value , and judged legal , is the Sniper ball by AccuBall . This ball is painted with multi-hued stripes . Before the swing , you can use the stripes for alignment and aim . After you hit the ball , you can tell by its color in flight the spin pattern you 've created : purple for hooks , orange for topspin , etc . <p> The Sniper makes even more sense on the putting green : You want to hit putts so the stripes roll over and over  --  wobbly patterns mean a mis-hit putt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . They can be ordered direct at 800-338-7468 . HEATED BALLS <p> If it 's really hot balls you want , try Thermal Distance . This $40 appliance , which wins this year 's prize for most unusual golf gimmick , heats three golf balls overnight to a surface temperature of about 125 degrees . Then , an insulated sack keeps them heated for about lout hours . <p> Why heated balls ? According to the company 's explanation , the heating of a projectile reduces its surface viscosity and distorts the boundary layer formed between the projectile and its ambient surroundings , thereby decreasing air resistance , or friction , enabling it to travel a greater distance . But of course . <p> Why not just pop a sleeve of balls into the oven before heading for the course ? Bill Cohen of Advanced Golf Concepts ( 914-631-1000 ) , which markets the Thermal Distance , warns that you could end up with exploding golf balls . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Swing low , and this Sony chariot will VCR your stroke right back at you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the videotape " with the Miyamae Video Analyzer <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Bridgestone Science Eye Handy 01 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : How sweet it is , or is n't .
