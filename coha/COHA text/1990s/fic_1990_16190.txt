FADE IN : 1 EXT . FIELD - DAY A football game is in progress . Six guys on each side , all in their late teens and early twenties , wearing khaki pants , work shirts , T-shirts . OVER , we hear the voice of BRUCE DERRINGER . The first player we see is VIRGE HOOGESTEGER . &nbsp; BRUCE ( V. O. ) Virge Hoogesteger. , What kind of name is that ? Nicknamed The Virgin. Well , look at him . Poor kid probably tries to get a girl into bed and she wants to make him brush his teeth and wash behind his ears . Then we see JACK BOCCI bulldozing down one of the defense players . &nbsp; BRUCE ( V. O. ) Look at this goon . Jack Bocci from Brooklyn . He 's a magician . Wants to be the next Houdini .

Writes poetry . Likes to read . Hates sports . Danny makes the touchdown . He shouts with exhilaration and raises the ball in triumph . Just then , a huge olive drab B-17 bomber appears out of nowhere and roars directly overhead . The game is forgotten and everyone starts running towards a short , boxy control tower . Now we see that the football field is a grassy area on the side of an air field with three intersecting runways . Men are coming from all over the base , on foot and bicycle , shouting out the number of planes : five , seven , nine , twelve ! Planes are appearing all over the sky . &nbsp; EUGENEFifteen , sixteen ! &nbsp; JACKHow many went out ? &nbsp; DANNYTwenty-one . &nbsp; VIRGEThere 's another ! We MOVE UP TO the control tower .

The adjutant comes up to him with some papers , the CO grabs them and motions the adjutant away . The CO is shocked by what he hears . He speaks quietly . &nbsp; COWhere ? But we hit that target a month ago , sir . I thought . . . The voice on the other end interrupts . &nbsp; COI know we have to put the pressure on , but I almost lost a quarter of my . . . The S-2 , a scholarly , bespectacled young man , comes in from the balcony and waits to get the CO 's attention . Frustrated , exasperated , the CO listens to the voice on the other end . &nbsp; COYes , sir . Yes , sir , I 'll have my ground crews work all night .

CONTROL TOWER BALCONY - DAY The CO looks out at arriving planes through his binoculars . &nbsp; BRUCEYou know , people at home are getting pretty discouraged by our losses .

That 's where I come in . The nation 's going to fall in love with those boys .

The wheel touches the runway and the plane immediately tips to the right . It pivots on its single wheel , scraping its belly on the runway . The props on the right side bend back , slowing the PLANE 's spin . It starts to come to a halt , but just as it looks like it 's safe , it EXPLODES in a sudden fiery blast . 5B EXT . CONTROL TOWER LAWN - DAY The six boys recoil with shock and disbelief . Danny watches as long as he can , then turns away  --  he ca n't stand it anymore . 6 EXT . CONTROL TOWER BALCONY - DAY Bruce is also looking at the burning plane with horror . The CO is stony-faced . He shows no surprise and little emotion  --  he 's seen it too often before . &nbsp; COCome on , Bruce , you wanted to meet the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They were almost home . &nbsp; COAlmost . The pilot came in on one wheel . He should have belly landed .  --  8  --  &nbsp; BRUCEAre they all . . . ? &nbsp; COWhat do you think ? Let 's go , Bruce .
