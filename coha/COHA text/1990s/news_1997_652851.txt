<p> WHEN THE GERMAN ARTIST Martin Kippenberger died in March , at the age of 43 , he seemed to have left no esthetic stone unturned . Nor had he run out of things to do . These slightly contradictory impressions converge in Kippenberger 's sprawling retrospective at the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art , a lively new museum in Geneva that seems destined to give the city a more prominent position on the contemporary art map . <p> Covering more than 20 galleries , " Martin Kippenberger Retrospective : 1997-1976 " ranges through more than 300 works executed in a bouquet of antic , Pop-flavored post-modern styles . The show was selected and installed by Kippenberger during the final stages of his losing battle with liver cancer , which , while it may have been hereditary , probably was n't helped by a life of excess . The show compares favorably in size with the 250-piece survey of Sigmar Polke 's work , currently on view in Bonn , and furthers the sense that European museums have their own method when it comes to retrospectives : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , and do n't worry about the niceties of installation design , layout or even labels . <p> There are several galleries devoted to Kippenberger 's raucous paintings , which liberally mix appropriated images , bravura brushwork and odd materials . They make the polymorphous irreverence of Mr. Polke , an important early influence , seem almost restrained , like an aberrant offshoot of Color Field painting . <p> Space has been found in this show for numerous exhibition posters and announcements , by which Kippenberger , who had 93 solo shows in 15 years ( roughly 6 per annum ) , forged his public persona as madcap bad boy . He considered them his printed graphic work until the end of his life , when he turned to traditional printmaking , producing a wrenching series of lithographs titled " The Raft of the Medusa , " which depict his ravaged face and bloated , flailing body . <p> Also here are numerous examples of the idiosyncratic , often elegant drawings that the artist  --  a peripatetic traveler who made extended working visits to New York , Los Angeles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also incorporated everything from mini-bars to " Do not disturb " signs into his sculptures . ) And a nearly blocklong gallery contains some 50 sculptures , each reflecting the artist 's gift for what might be called the " manipulated ready-made "  --  amalgams of found objects ranging from garish to austere and full of acidic , anti-bourgeoisie asides . <p> One sculpture is a small disco floor for chickens . Another is a mini-refrigerator covered with elastic toweling as if by a tea cozy . A third is a cardboard box lined with color reproductions from the catalogue of " Post-Human , " a Swiss exhibition of figurative art . Elsewhere a pair of vertical rectangles , one made of black rubber , the other a stack of painted cinder blocks , is titled " Love Affair Without Racism . " Another sculpture is an armoire containing five thick books labeled " M. K. " Each volume contains several hundred pages printed with the image of a printing press , one of the artist 's " hotel drawings . " <p> There are works that operate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ un-post-modern robustness . One gallery features large wall reliefs in black or white latex that turn out to be casts of paintings . Another contains actual-size photographs of big , colorful paintings ; the original works , torn and broken , are stuffed into a small Dumpster in the center of the room . <p> ALL TOLD , THIS EXHIBITION conveys a vivid sense of Kippenberger hurtling through life , scattering a dense trail of artworks and art-related activities behind him , and then skidding to an abrupt , premature halt . As you walk into the final galleries , which are as weird and energetic as the opening ones , it seems possible that the artist is just around the corner , turning out a few more paintings and drawings . The last works here , added after his death , continue the sense of forward motion : they show him abandoning his usual late-Dada stance to make sardonic versions of Matisse still lifes and recapitulate Picasso 's portraits of Jacqueline . An open-ended ending , to say the least . <p> Born in 1953 to a mine director and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , near Cologne , the only boy in a family of two older and two younger sisters . He showed artistic talent , and independence , at at early age , boycotting art classes in elementary school after a teacher gave him only the second highest grade . By the time he was 20 , he had been through drug rehabilitation once and was living on his own in Hamburg , where he attended the Art Academy . In 1976 he quit art school and moved to Florence , where he began a series of black-and-white paintings based on postcards and snapshots . He intended for the paintings to form a stack that equaled his own height ( about 6 feet 2 1/2 inches ) , but he stopped about 4 inches shy of his goal , and soon returned to Germany . <p> His adult life was characterized by hard work and drink . Some of his friends and associates maintain that the habits were related : he had to be doing something or to anesthetize himself . He regularly gave up alcohol on doctor 's orders , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who worked with him said that he seemed to find sobriety unbearable or at least boring and characterized him as " an alcoholic with total recall , " who repeatedly surprised them by remembering in detail projects cooked up during drunken late-night conversations  --  and usually seeing them to fruition . <p> Accounts of his life make his hyperactivity palpable . He did n't just make art but rather conducted an extended performance in the vicinity of art that involved running galleries , organizing exhibitions , collecting the work of his contemporaries and overseeing assistants . He published books and catalogues , played in a rock-and-roll band and cut records , ran a performance-art space during his early years in Berlin , became part owner of a restaurant in Los Angeles during six months he spent there preparing for an exhibition and collaborated extensively with other artists . <p> Three years before his death , he founded a museum of contemporary art on the Greek island of Syros , on a plot of land given him by a friend ; using mostly his own money , he was designing and constructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his peers . <p> His main mission in life seems to have been to disturb as many status quos as often as possible , his own included . While visiting Brazil , he bought a gas station and named it after the Nazi leader Martin Bormann , considering the work a sculpture and also exhibiting large-scale photographs of it . <p> The words " cynical " and " nihilistic " echo throughout the extensive writings on Kippenberger 's work , but the feeling one gets from this exhibition is of a fierce , sometimes furious , passion and an artist both amused by and irate at art 's position in society . He clearly meant to turn one 's consciousness of art and its function in the world inside out , to fully reveal its role as personal expression , as visual commentary and as commodity . Not all his methods were entirely original ; in fact , maybe none of them were . If Kippenberger was an art-scene catalyst , his actual art is extremely reactive , made in response to the facts of his life and as often as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with John Baldessari , one of his first exhibition consisted of quasi-Photo Realist paintings that he commissioned a commercial artist to make . Robert Rauschenberg 's " Erased de Kooning " is evoked by a sculpture ( not in the show )  --  a table whose top consists of a small gray painting by Gerhard Richter that Kippenberger owned . <p> Kippenberger seems to have felt that every artwork deserved a worthy counterpoint . This show is rife with glimmers of his contemporaries ' work : Bruce Nauman , Joseph Beuys , Reinhard Mucha , Richard Prince and Daniel Buren . One gallery is devoted to kitschy wood reliefs reminiscent of works by Jeff Koons . <p> One senses in this visual turmoil , in which every gallery introduces a new esthetic tangent , an enormous fear of settling , of becoming a successful artist turning out a predictable , consistent product . In lengthy interviews , in which he sounds as much like an art critic as an artist , Kippenberger regularly razzed other artists , especially the German Neo-Expressionists who emerged just before him , for going soft , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careers . <p> It helps that he also razzed himself . He liked to say that he had to make bad paintings so people would be able to identify the good ones . And recurring throughout the show in painting , photograph and drawing , is a self-abnegating image of himself as artist-nerd , with his underpants pulled up over his potbelly , like a Germanic version of Martin Short . ( But Kippenberger specifies the inspiration , including a famous photograph of Picasso on the beach , in white swimming trunks with a sleek Afghan hound by his side in several collages . ) <p> Kippenberger 's refusal to settle , his determination to keep on moving regardless of the odds , may cost him a permanent place in history , and I say this thinking that he is one of the three or four best German artists of the postwar period . But his work is so much of the moment , so reflective of the art around it , that it can seem like the artistic equivalent of newsprint . Its all-for-now perishability attracts us , but could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , you can rest assured that Kippenberger 's achievement will lie in wait , coiled to spring at all artists in need of such wise and celebratory skepticism , and ready to blow up in their faces .
