<p> THE REPUBLICAN sweep of Congress did more than end 40 years of Democratic rule  --  it pushed black America into a corner . <p> The Congressional Black Caucus is politically impotent , its members stripped of key committee chairmanships and their voices weakened in the diminished choir of Democrats . <p> The most influential black American in government today is Republican-appointed Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas . <p> The African American with the best chance of impacting the political and ideological mainstream in this country is now a conservative military man with Republican patrons  --  Colin Powell . <p> And even as it pushed civil rights crusader Jesse Jackson farther from nation 's political center , it boosted his resolve to consider a third-party run for the presidency . <p> Tragically , at this moment when black America is in need of direction , the once-grand NAACP is suddenly powerless . <p> Those are the facts . And together , they offer proof that black liberal demands for more seats in Congress , more special programs for minorities and more support for a black separatist movement have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political dialogue . <p> In effect , the black liberal strategy of the past three decades has backfired by inadvertently strengthening the hand of a group long considered the enemy of strong civil rights  --  conservative Republicans . <p> " All the institutions we developed for the purpose of influencing the mainstream have become moribund , dysfunctional and self-destructive , " said Michael Meyers , executive director of the New York Civil Rights Coalition and a former top official of the NAACP . " We 've been so content with getting set-asides , carving a special program for our own , that we no longer engage the mass of the American population in dialogue  --  if anyone does n't agree with the civil rights groups they are written off as ideologues , called bigots . " <p> In political terms , the end of the dialogue between blacks and the rest of the nation surfaces most visibly in the efforts of black leaders to support congressional redistricting in the South . Those new boundaries will bring a record number of blacks to Capitol Hill in January  --  40 in the House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Republican takeover of Congress . <p> Although the new congressional boundaries created new black majorities , they delivered many surrounding areas into Republican hands by stripping those districts of their black , mostly Democratic , voters . For example , redistricting has brought eight new black seats to Congress from Alabama , Georgia , Florida and North Carolina . But it has also meant that 15 new Republican seats have been added from those states . <p> " A lot of people said redistricting was a strategy , a means to an end of getting more power for black people by getting more blacks in Congress , " said David Bositis , senior analyst for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies , the nation 's leading black think tank . " If redistricting was a means to an end , it turned out to be a dead end . The Black Caucus has never been weaker than it is today . " <p> In a sense , Justice Thomas , who has opposed using race as a factor to create new congressional districts , has now been vindicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress have also lost three House chairmanships , including the Armed Services and Government Operations committees , as well as 17 subcommittee chairs . <p> On the new political landscape , the black politicians with the greatest power are those who have centered themselves in the mainstream . Among those whose influence is rising , says Bositis , are the black mayors of Cleveland , Denver and Seattle , influential black leaders of state legislatures and blacks who won congressional seats in mostly white districts . <p> Phyllis Berry Myers , president of the conservative Second Look Institute , points to New York State Comptroller Carl McCall , the first black to hold statewide office there , as evidence that blacks can succeed if they appeal to a diverse constituency . <p> Jesse Jackson , the nation 's preeminent civil rights leader , who occasionally stirs the political waters by running for president , is not convinced that black strategies of the past should be abandoned . The fight for redistricting , he says , should continue as a means of increasing the number of black faces in Congress , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And he questions the notion that blacks should align themselves more closely with conservatives in order to have their voices heard . <p> " The question is working with them on what  --  going after welfare mothers , dismantling public housing and job training ? " he asks . <p> Jackson believes the GOP tidal wave was less a conservative shift in the nation 's thinking than evidence of low black voter turnout caused by dissatisfaction with President Clinton . And Jackson takes delight in the defeat of moderate Democrats like Rep. Dave McCurdy ( Okla. ) , figuring that their losses will help him push the party back to the left and enhance Jackson 's own role in setting the liberal agenda . <p> In an interview at his Rainbow Coalition office on K Street , Jackson also said he is considering a third party movement and hinted at a presidential bid in 1996 . Jackson said he will first try to prevent Clinton from moving more toward the right as he attempts to reach compromise with new Republican leaders . But if Clinton does n't respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will run himself . <p> " It 's not something I look forward to but something I may have to do to recapture the moral center , " Jackson said of a presidential bid . " I 'd rather Clinton return to the moral center and recapture his covenant with the people , but if he is pulled to the political center , and away from the moral center , then the burden , obligation and political risk of running for president will have to be seen as in the interest of our struggle . " <p> Already , Jackson is laying the ground work for a presidential run by discussing with Rainbow Coalition chapters nationwide the best means of forming a new black party that would get him on state ballots in time for the 1996 primary . He also has built a computer database filled with nearly a half-million names of people who would be supportive of such an effort . <p> For blacks in Congress , the strengthened hand of conservatives means it is time to rethink old political alliances and devise new ways to exert black influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Caucus , with 41 members ( two of them Republicans ) , should hold some leverage over Democrats still in the House : " We are now big fish in a little pond , " he said , " and we should not be dictated to by losers and marginal winners , " referring to white Democrats in the party 's congressional leadership . <p> Rep. Kweisi Mfume ( D-Md. ) hopes to move from head of the Black Caucus to head of the Democratic Congressional Caucus . That move would make Mfume a key player in shaping the Democratic agenda as the party tries to revive its political fortunes . <p> But some caucus members wonder whether Mfume could find himself the captain of a sinking Democratic ship . <p> The Republicans , on the other hand , have reason to pay attention to what the Black Caucus wants them to hear , argues Rangel : " I ca n't tell House Speaker-to-be Newt Gingrich what to do , but to the extent he needs 40 votes to get anything done , he should be willing to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise of the Republicans offers a chance to take a fresh look at issues in ways that will ultimately benefit black America . <p> " If you think of the problems affecting black people  --  from increasing illegitimate births to welfare , the working poor needing assistance and a need for developing more entrepreneurs  --  then there are great areas of opportunity for new Republican ideas to take hold , " said Myers of the Second Look Institute . <p> Black Republicans , however , are not expecting the new Republican leadership to do business in the same old way . There will now be now two black Republicans in Congress  --  J.C . Watts , newly elected representative from Oklahoma , and second-term congressman Gary Franks of Connecticut  --  and there are expectations that black Republicans will be given a louder voice amidst their suddenly rich white relatives on the Hill . <p> " Liberal black leaders have been advertising themselves as leaders of the black community for too long and this is a chance to reverse that , " said Alan Keyes , chairman of Black America 's Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My assessment of this election is that it was good for black people , good for black conservatives and bad for the liberal community . " <p> If there is a flaw in this way of thinking , it is that black Republicans are in many ways relying on the good will of white Republicans , and not much else . Unlike black Democrats , black Republicans have almost no power to force party doors to open . Already , some black Republicans complain that their party would have fared even better in the mid-term elections had more candidates reached out to black voters . <p> It is in the face of this political upheaval that the absence of a strong NAACP is all the more glaring and painful . The nation 's oldest civil rights group , the NAACP has long served as the moderate , reasoned voice of black America . Now that role will increasingly be filled by black liberal demagogues . <p> With a weakened NAACP , there is no prominent civil rights group to reach out nationally and impact political debate with some moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and white of the long struggle for integration and the benefits it has brought the nation . <p> All that can be said with certainty about the political crisis facing black America is that more talk of separatism , short-sighted visions of increasing black faces in Congress at the expense of black power in Congress and self-destructive delight in the problems of white Democrats is effectively painting black America into a corner with no escape . <p> Juan Williams writes frequently about politics for Outlook .
