It never occurred to Birnhaus that he might clean the apartment himself . Immediately after Sara 's departure he had dabbled at dishwashing and in the three months since then he had changed the bedsheets a few times  --  as many times as he had had other women in their bed  --  but that was about it . His heart was n't in it . A thick crust of toothpaste and sputum built up on the rim of the sink in the master bedroom and dust gathered like sea-wrack at the baseboards and around the bottom of standing lamps , table legs , chair legs . When one night Birnhaus waited for a video to rewind he unconsciously ran his finger across the top of the VCR and noticed the deep stripe he had drawn in the dust . A few evenings after that , while reading in bed , he dozed off and let the book slip from his grasp and when he reached down to retrieve it from the rug beneath felt something round and hard under his fingertips . This turned out to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to have been some time before Sara left-by Gingerbread , the rust-colored toy poodle his ex had brought to their marriage . <p> The milk curdling in the refrigerator , the mildew on the shower curtain , the mountain of Washington Posts that had grown next to his desk , the overflowing trash baskets , none of this had as much of an effect on him as did that single dog souvenir beneath the bed . His passions about the split-up had calmed a bit . Probably a month or two before , Birnhaus would have called Sara and shouted at her until she slammed down the receiver at her end with the same rage that had driven him at his . But things had settled . <p> Greg Johnson had told him they would , he of the many affairs and no marriages . <p> " How do you know all this stuff ? " Birnhaus said to him one night over the crashing waves of voices at Paolo 's . <p> Johnson , a few years younger than Birnhaus but with a lot less hair , sipped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do I know that within the next ten minutes in will walk a woman with an incomparable hard body who we will figure to be twenty-two and will turn out to be about sixteen ? " <p> " You do n't have to be Nostradamus to figure that , " Birnhaus said . " You just have to remember what happened to us last week . " <p> " Last week you were carrying a bigger torch for Sara than you are now . Everything runs down , Lucretius tells us . It 's the nature of things . " Johnson belched , a sound like the one a frog might make while being swallowed whole by a snake . He took another sip of tequila and gave Birnhaus a big fat grin . <p> A woman walked in , two women , in fact  --  or girls , as Birnhaus pointed out to Johnson without much glee-and they talked to them a while and since the bartender did n't make a fuss about it bought them some drinks . <p> But Birnhaus 's heart was n't in this either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction sent some liquid splattering across Birnhaus 's shirt sleeve , something he would have laughed off when Sara was around . Now all the accident did was make him think of all the other soiled clothing back in the apartment and of that hardened memento left behind by his former dog . <p> Later , at home , alone again with the eleven o'clock news , he tried again to face up to the mess that surrounded him and rushed into the bedroom and with a series of yanking and jerking motions stripped the filthy sheets from his bed . Voices in the other room startled him , and his heart stopped racing only when he remembered that he had left the television set running . He opened himself a beer , not a terrific idea since he had been keeping up with Greg Johnson all night at Paolo 's , and sat a while after the regular newscast to watch a group of broad-faced , dark-haired Middle Easterners discuss the disastrous events in their part of the world with a calm and coolness Birnhaus wished he could maintain when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night , only for a few hours before awakening to find himself burdened with an erection he promptly set about dealing with , christening the newly spread sheets with a thick and sticky hosing of salt-perfumed sperm . Then he lay back in the odd greenish glow of his digital clock and waited for the buzzer . Birnhaus did n't have to be Nostradamus to predict that some time or other he would lift himself out of this funk . But when ? When ? <p> The alarm caught him dozing , dreaming even , or so he thought , having in his mind the fleeting memory of a walk through a seaside resort with some unknown woman , something he knew he had n't done recently in his waking life . The conviction built in him as he showered and dressed for work . Something  --  something was going to have to change . <p> This sensation stayed with Birnhaus most of the day , during which he performed as a kind of sleepwalker the particular labors that brought him a reasonably large amount of cash each year since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of catching a bite to eat with Johnson or one of the other men in the office , he stayed at his desk , fiddling with numbers on his screen . It was odd these days how nothing soothed him so much as playing his fingers across the keyboard , odd and rather ironic , since it had been Sara 's great lament that he could n't ever figure anything out . <p> Figure what ? he 'd say . <p> Figure it out , she 'd throw back at him . <p> When everything fell apart and Sara and Gingerbread left for L.A. , Birnhaus dabbled a little at figuring in a series of Saturday morning sessions with Dr. Gordon , a psychologist with an office on a lower floor in his building . The location was obviously convenient and such sessions were covered in his health plan . But after a while his fatigue after late Fridays with women or even just drinking with Johnson at Paolo 's won out over his desire to find exactly what it was he needed to figure . <p> " Get a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night when they started at Paolo 's and then met two women and walked over to One Step Down . A trio played souped up ballads and got the others tapping their glasses on the little table . <p> " I 'd rather have a little Debussy , " Birnhaus said , " or Satie . Yeah  --  Satie  --  " <p> A blank look unfolded on the face of the girl closest to him . Only a few weeks before this would not have fazed him . He would have been encouraged that this woman  --  or girl  --  with streaked blond hair and a look of innocence painted over her already innocent , or was it ignorant ? face would not care much for knowing anything beyond the moment and the color of her nails and hair . Even a few weeks before Birnhaus himself was still not much for talking except for the sort of conversation that pushed you along toward the time when you stripped away her clothing and yours and tore breathlessly toward a climax . <p> " I 'm not feeling so good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date and her friend . He set down his drink and pushed his chair back from the little table . " I 'm sure Mister Johnson here can keep you both happy . " <p> " What 's that supposed to mean ? " said the girl with the painted face . Her voice was rather pettish and as she licked her lips to close off her remark Birnhaus felt a great rush of pleasure at the thought that he was about to make his exit . But in the next instant this look of hers that seemed at first so scornful turned into a sort of smile and her tongue peeked out , lizard-like , from between her thickly made-up lips in a little lascivious salute of farewell , leaving Birnhaus to ponder all the way home along shadowy streets broken only here and there by lamplight from a housefront or street lamps shaded by billowing wind-blown branches thick with leaves just what might have transpired between him and the girl if he had stayed . <p> No television news for him that night , no reading in bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind to discover the Satie he was thinking of and he played " Gymnopedies " loud enough to hear it in the bedroom when he threw himself into the half-soiled sheets and fell into a dreamless slumber , only to awaken early the next morning to find himself once again engorged with lust and ready to dabble in all of the ways he had sworn off the night before . <p> There was only one thing to do , he decided over his coffee , in order to break up the logjam in his head and give himself some peace in his chest  --  he could barely think about his heart itself anymore , let alone put the thought into a metaphor except to think chest . So after the coffee he passed up pedaling a few miles on his exercycle , found some clean clothes amid the huge pile of unfolded laundry overflowing his dresser , and took the elevator to the second floor . <p> When he stepped into Dr. Gordon 's waiting room he discovered a short , wide-hipped woman with a crinkled , nut-brown face and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years younger . For a moment he thought she was a patient . But then she smiled at him , revealing several gold teeth , and bent to retrieve the plastic lining from the wastebasket at the far side of the sofa , holding up for inspection the bundle of crumpled papers and used tissues as though it were a prize . <p> A door opened and from the inner office came the black-stick thin Mrs. Keen , Dr. Gordon 's secretary . Within a few minutes Birnhaus had arranged to see the psychologist again and to have the Mexican maid come up to his apartment to clean once a week . <p> Senora Claro brushed her hair from her wrinkled face and showed him where to put the accent mark when he wrote out her first check . Her breath was tinged with spices Birnhaus could not quite identify  --  cloves ? saffron ?  --  and he knew from then on that she had been at work on his apartment even before he saw the sparkling surfaces in the kitchen or noticed that the pillows had been carefully arranged once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traces of those same mysterious spices tempering the astringent odor of cleanliness that she left in her wake . Her English , as it happened , was good enough so that he did n't have to strain that first time when giving her instructions about the front lock  --  since Mrs. Keen gave her such a good recommendation he did n't hesitate to present her with her own set of keys  --  and though she said that she would have to come at odd hours in order to fit him into her schedule it scarcely mattered to Birnhaus because of his own long days . <p> The one time in the next several months that he came home early , he opened the door to sniff the by now familiar odor of her spicy presence and found her huffing and puffing as she struggled to pull the sofa away from the window so that she might clean behind it . As he put his own weight into the labor , he graciously ordered her never to try and do that again , and then laughed with her as she held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath where the sofa had stood . <p> " It was my wife 's , " he said , laughing with her , but in truth he did n't recognize the scarf . <p> " It 's uh-very beautiful , " said Senora Claro , catching her breath after the laughter . <p> Birnhaus could n't be sure if she was praising the scarf in order to pay him a compliment about Sara , or if she merely liked the scarf . <p> " Please take this , " he said , folding her hand over the discovery . <p> " Oh , no , senora , " said the Mexican maid , but it was clear that she was accepting it as a gift . <p> Hiring the maid or seeing Dr. Gordon again  --  Birnhaus could n't have said for sure which of these decisions made him feel better about his life until one Saturday a few weeks later when he awoke with that same young blond girl in his bed whom he had skipped out on that night at One Step Down . Janine was her name and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years on her . He should have gotten dressed and gone downstairs for his appointment , but instead he dawdled in bed with the girl , and then dozed off , dreaming that same dream again about walking with the woman by the seawall . <p> Janine had gone by the time he awoke . A shopping trip with her girl friend so and so , her note told him . In an odd new way , Birnhaus felt happy that she had left , although he admitted to himself she was n't much of a presence when she was with him , not being much more than her body and her makeup and her youth . Into the bathroom  --  and he was pleased with how clean the commode and sink and shower stall showed under the lights . Something pricked at his toe just then and he bent down to retrieve a hairpin that Janine must have dropped as she was making her escape earlier that morning . He stared at the pin a moment and then dropped it neatly into the wastebasket beneath the sink . The plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good he was feeling . <p> A few minutes later he called downstairs to apologize to Mrs. Keen for missing his appointment and asked to reschedule . There was a sternness to the woman ' s voice that he did n't appreciate , until she changed her tone to ask how Senora Claro was working out . <p> " Fine , " he said , " just fine . " <p> And it was true , she was working out just splendidly , vacuuming and scouring and dusting each week so that Birnhaus came to look upon himself as a man who lived in cleanliness rather than amidst debris . Now and then  --  miracle of miracles  --  he even stopped off at the supermarket on his way home and picked up some ground beef or chicken thighs and cooked for himself , free to splash about with sherry and oils because of the knowledge that the senora would be in within a day or two to clean up the mess on the stove and in the sink . <p> " You were right , " he said to Greg Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his direction . <p> " About what ? " Johnson flashed a foolish grin at the girl at his side . <p> " About fucking everything . You 're a genius . Bald , but a genius . " <p> Johnson gave him the finger . The girls laughed . This was the way things went for months . They drank a lot and then later in the evening went their way two by two , Johnson and his girl to his place  --  a fancy little efficiency over near Dupont Circle  --  and Birnhaus and his girl , first Janine , and then a secretary from the office named Karen , a freckle-spattered redhead from West Virginia , to his fresh-smelling quarters . <p> The season changed , which meant that now and then they might have to take a taxi to avoid the cold wet rain , and once or twice Birnhaus even cranked up his old BMW which usually spent most of its time in the garage below the building . The city , he had concluded long ago , was meant for walking and taxis and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken an occasional weekend drive into Virginia , but somehow Birnhaus was n't moved to travel anymore , not , at least , with the girls he was going out with these days . <p> He talked of Sara once in a while . At a session with Dr. Gordon before he let the therapy thing slide again , he put it this way : " I had n't been thinking about her , you know ? and then one night I was reading in bed , yup , I still stay home a few nights alone reading , watching a video , maybe , so anyway , there I was , and I turned a page , this was in a spy novel by Robert Littell , somebody you really ought to read , an old school pal of mine turned me on to him , anyway , so I was turning the page and that was when I remembered falling asleep with a book one night a few months after Sara left , and I woke up , you know how you sort of snap yourself awake ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? and I found this hard thing under my fingers , a turd from our old dog , a little doggie souvenir , and the other night I was in bed again and like I said I turned the page and I remembered that other time ... and that was when the thoughts of Sara came back to me . Can you believe that ? because I was remembering finding that dog turd ? But I do n't find shit like that anymore , oh , yeah , a bad pun , but anyway I have got a woman who comes in to clean , the same Mexican woman cleans this office as a matter of fact , Senora Claro , and she does a great job . I love coming back to a clean apartment . To tell you the truth , Sara just never got the place that clean , or how else do you think that dog turd stayed there under the bed in the first place ? I miss that dog now and then , you know . When Sara left I felt a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Sara felt a thing . She was according to her just beginning to have a hard time with me when she packed up and left . That 's how Sara always did it . Trouble coming up , she splits . She learned it from her father , I think . He abandoned the family a couple of times and came back and left again before he died . But that ' s Sara 's family , and I should be talking about mine , right ? " <p> Yet he scarcely ever spoke of his family , dead father , mother remarried and living outside Minneapolis , while the sessions with Dr. Gordon continued , which was only for a few weeks more . As it happened , work began to really pick up , three or four turns he suggested that the company take proving to be enormously successful and distracting him from vague unease that had sent him to see the psychologist in the first place . And then a new woman turned up , too , a Jewish girl from New York , a friend of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took the train down to see him several weekends that winter . <p> It was the night before one of those weekends that Birnhaus came home to a dusty apartment . By the following Monday the mess he and the Jewish girl had made was still there when he returned after dark . Another two days went by and he began to get antsy about Senora Claro ' s presence . By Saturday morning he was feeling quite annoyed . He wanted to call Dr. Gordon 's office to ask about the Mexican woman , but of course he did n't want to speak to Mrs. Keen . He decided to let it slide one more weekend , but the place was getting so filthy  --  and he had grown so accustomed to the opposite state  --  that he lasted only to the middle of the week . <p> Mrs. Keen was merciless with him on the telephone , as he knew she would be , explaining with ice-cold precision that Senora Claro had developed a heart problem and had gone in to Georgetown Medical Center for a catheterization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to work again , though she supposed it would be as soon as possible . <p> " She supports all of her sister 's family down in Puebla , " Mrs. Keen said in a voice that Birnhaus could scarcely let into his ear without wincing . " So I 'm sure she 'll be back just as soon as the doctors tell her it 's okay . " <p> All right , all right , Birnhaus was thinking , but at least she did n't bring up the subject of another appointment , and then they had finished , and Birnhaus found his finger , nearly unbidden , punching out another number . <p> " Hey , how 's the pup doing ? " he said when Sara came on the line . <p> " Norm , " she said , " what a surprise . But I ca n't talk to you right now . Can you call back tomorrow ? " <p> " Sure , " he said , trying to keep his disappointment from spilling out into his voice . Seated as he was at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keyboard , but then he set it aside and called Greg 's extension but the line was busy . He was almost tempted to call Mrs. Keen again to see if she had Senora Claro 's home number when Greg himself wandered over and they made plans for the evening . As it turned out , Greg had an appointment with his dentist just after work and so they decided to meet at Paolo 's later on . <p> At about seven o'clock Birnhaus came home to his apartment to find the door open a crack . His heart pounding from his initial fear of burglary , he peered inside , and then after listening carefully pushed the door a little further and stepped gingerly inside only to discover Senora Claro standing at the kitchen sink wielding her trusty sponge . Birnhaus stood a moment and talked with her , trying to calm himself , pleased to be inhaling once again the familiar odor of cloves and the other spices the woman chewed . He inquired about her medical problem and as much as she could tell about it she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catheterized and that it would be necessary for her to go back again for further scrutiny within the month . <p> " And have they put you on a special diet ? " Birnhaus was staring at her throat and it was only then that he realized that tucked into the top of her plain white blouse she was wearing the scarf he had given her . <p> " Oh , eh-yess , " she said , showing him her gold teeth in a smile . " Es-special diet . No meat , no fat . " There was a little tremor in her voice , and it might have been her normal way of speaking or it might have been born of fear at her condition . <p> " They eh-think I need an es operacion , " she said , her brown face crinkling into a leathery but pleasant smile as she turned to wipe the kitchen surfaces . <p> Birnhaus wrote out her check , and after a brief pause wrote a second check , which , he explained when handing it over , was to help her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Senora Claro , pausing to take both checks and stuff them into the pockets of her brown polyester trousers . <p> " I 'm going out now , " Birnhaus said . <p> " Si , " the woman said . <p> " And remember , " he said , pointing to the sofa and making a pantomime with his hands and arms , " no pushing furniture . Capisce ? " <p> " Si , Mister Birnhaus , I wo n't eh-push . " She showed him those teeth again in a smile . <p> So Birnhaus left for his rendezvous with Greg Johnson , feeling rather celebratory that the maid was back to work for him . <p> " What is it with you tonight ? " Greg said after a few drinks , though Birnhaus could hardly find the words to explain . And within the hour he was too drunk anyway even to try . So they decided to put their energy to the best possible use and call some girls . <p> Janine had her answering machine on and did n't come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at home but already in bed . <p> But Johnson finally hit the jackpot for them with a call to a new girl , a little Afro-American secretary from his part of the office . Her name was Delly , and she and her roommate were just sitting around watching a video and though they did n't want to come out they invited the two men over for a nightcap . <p> " It 's a different life-style , " Johnson said in the cab on the way over to their place in Adams-Morgan . " It 's passed down from generation to generation . Their ancestors , see , were kept up real late toiling in the fields , so staying up late just became a way of life in America . " <p> Birnhaus was trying to catch his breath , because for some reason his heart was racing uncharacteristically fast , and pondering this bit of social interpretation when they reached the apartment house where the two girls lived . <p> But it turned out to be three girls . <p> " Our cup runneth over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as they came in the door . <p> Birnhaus thought Delly was real cute , with her skin the color of mahogany not much different  --  the comparison leaped to his mind  --  from that of Senora Claro . And she had a pert , Indian-like nose , and a great smile  --  no gold teeth  --  and he wondered why he had n't noticed her before in the office . Alongside her the other two girls seemed dark and drab despite the brightness of their bathrobes and hair ribbons and smiling faces . <p> Greg ordered them a couple of pizzas and they ate these along with a large quantity of beer and watched the last half of " Pretty Woman , " laughing and talking . Birnhaus got to sit on the sofa with Delly , and enjoyed it immensely , especially , toward the end of their stay , the little fantasy he conjured up about what might happen if and when he asked Delly out for a drink . <p> The little nip she gave him on the ear just before he and Greg went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to decide to ask her out for lunch the next day . The problem was that by the time he got a cab and went home and took the elevator to his floor he had forgotten her name . <p> What was it ? he interrogated himself as he took out his keys and unlocked the apartment door . <p> The living room lights were ablaze , a welcoming touch left by the Mexican maid , and the air was filled with the odor of cleansers and the familiar scent of her spices . Birnhaus wore a smile on his face as the went for the telephone , hoping to extract the girl 's name again from Johnson before his friend fell asleep . <p> " You asked her , " Greg said at the other end of the line . His voice was blurred , as though the connection were made under water or he had suffered a stroke . <p> " You 're not pissed , are you ? " <p> " I 'm pissed , " Johnson said . <p> " It 's just for lunch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tidiness of it all . <p> That was when he noticed her , wedged between the television set and the wall , crumpled up into a jackknife position , as though she had been bending over either to pull out the plug or put it in when the attack came upon her . <p> " Senora , " Birnhaus said at the top of his voice , tossing the telephone aside and rushing to kneel and try to turn her body toward him . <p> She was very heavy . Remembering some vague instructions from a course he had only heard about in college but never took , Birnhaus with some effort pulled the woman away from the wall and turned her on her back in the middle of the rug . He clumsily undid the clothing around her chest , tearing at the scarf , pulling open her cheap synthetic blouse . Her brown chest was nearly as flat as a man 's and only the dark fleshy stubs of her nipples gave him pause before he began massaging her with his palms , pressing hard with his thumbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first he thought it was the woman , when he remembered the telephone and lunged toward the fallen receiver . <p> " Greg , " he said , " call an ambulance , " and then raced on his knees back to the woman 's side . Leaning close to her mouth he breathed in the faint familiar odor of her spices , and nearly gagging pulled back for a moment before dipping his head toward her again , using his fingers to pry open her cold , unyielding lips before he pressed his own against her . <p> Taking a deep breath , he blew in , and then pulled back as he pressed down on her chest . And then with a breath he dove toward her lips again , tasting beneath the layer of spices a bitter sip of oily food and a harsh dab of tobacco . Was she a smoker ? How could she do that to herself when she had such a terrible heart condition ? Blowing in , pressing down , blowing in , pressing down , these thoughts raced through his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have said how long this went on  --  breathing , blowing , pressing , breathing , blowing , pressing , as though he were some grotesque mother bird and this woman beneath him the nestling he was feeding mouth to mouth  --  but then he heard the sirens in the street below , and something caved in within his own chest , and he paused in his work above the body , panting , weeping , groaning , and somehow at the same time savoring in his own mouth the spices the woman had chewed , the meals she had eaten , the cigarettes she had smoked . There came a pounding at the door , and as if that were the signal he were waiting for , Birnhaus collapsed onto the woman even as his own gorge rose and spewed forth his own late supper and all the beer and  --  it seemed  --  all of the drinks he had drunk at Paolo 's , all of the meals taken there and at other exotic restaurants , and all of the smokes and the hors d'oeuvres and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and toppings and the saliva of a thousand kisses , from his mother 's to those on the lips of every woman he had ever tasted , this wretched acid gush of waste that flowed down over his shirt front and poured onto the prone body of the Mexican maid , sloshed over her chest and neck , and left an indelible stain on the rug beneath her . <p> At least it seemed as if it would never come out . After the paramedics left , Birnhaus walked in circles around the stain for what seemed like an hour , and then he suddenly dashed into the kitchen and went digging beneath the sink for cleaners and soaps and sponges and brushes and went to work on the mark on the rug . Wetting , washing , scrubbing , staring , studying , and then beginning the cycle again , he spent the last of his energies of the day  --  or night , for it had been night a long while now and was edging up on the deepest part of itself , when blackness is compounded on blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still and no birds sing . When he flung himself onto the bed , the last image he held in his mind before going under was the outline of the stain . Nearly circular , but with ragged edges , it might have been the circumference of some exotic country on a map in a yellowing geography . <p> Someone from the police called the next morning  --  on the telephone , not in person , because they had too many homicides to deal with these days , the woman said , and they were stretched thin enough to prefer a telephone call to a trip out into the field for a death by heart failure . He went over his story with her and the woman seemed satisfied . <p> " We 'll get back to you if we find that we need any more information , Mr. Birnhaus , " she said by way of farewell . <p> Birnhaus stayed at the telephone , first calling the office to say that he would not be coming in today .

But all the way down in the elevator-not a long ride , but at this moment longer than it usually seemed  --  he could n't seem to help but cling to that notion . <p> I 'll ask Mrs. Keen , he decided , since he had to break the news to her anyway . If she was n't in yet , he 'd just sit in the hall and wait . <p> Sniff , sniff , he tried to breathe normally through his clogged nostrils . Nothing doing . Sniff . Snuff . Sniff . <p> He had some questions for the doctor , too . <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
