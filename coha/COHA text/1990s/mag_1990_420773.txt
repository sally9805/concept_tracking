Section : News you can use ; Cover story ; 1991 Investment guide Opportunities abound even in the gathering economic storm . Take decisive action now-and think bonds <p> A more tortured investment environment would be hard to imagine . The economy , after dancing on the brink of recession for months , has finally gone over the edge and is now falling fast . Consumer confidence and business confidence are both plunging . Demand for goods and services is threatening to collapse . The cost of purging the debt-burdened financial system of the excesses of the 1980s is growing by the day . Inflation concerns have given way to worries about deflation , as housing prices and other asset values are being savaged . The limping banks , wounded by real-estate losses , have become the Ebenezer Scrooges of the holiday season , crunching the economy with their parsimonious lending policies . Finally , there is the ultimate uncertainty : The threat of war in the Persian Gulf , with a looming January 15 deadline for the outbreak of hostilities . <p> Rather than despair and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take decisive action . Just as the words crisis and opportunity are both represented by the identical ideogram in Chinese , the current bleak outlook , verging on crisis , is inevitably going to lead to some great opportunities to make money in both stocks and bonds in 1991 . But you 'll need to reposition your investments to take advantage of what lies ahead . Stock owners who have n't already pared back their portfolios to core long-term holdings should use the current bear-market rally to get the job done . Likewise , with interest rates falling , income-oriented investors should have started to move some funds into high-quality bonds . <p> Opportunity should not be confused with opportunism . In uncertain times , caution , steadiness , patience and a clear focus on quality will see you through and will also produce good returns at a relatively low risk level . " This downturn is already creating such opportunities that you do n't have to stick your neck out , ' says Richard Strong , chairman of the Milwaukee-based Strong group of mutual funds . " By staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up making a lot of money . ' <p> In its 1991 investment outlook , U.S. News presents a shopping list of 100 top stocks ( see page 96 ) , based on their ability to generate consistent and superior earnings , and 100 mutual funds ( page 112 ) - divided into 20 stock and bond categories - that have performed the best in recent market cycles . <p> Before setting off on a buying spree , it is paramount that you establish the right priorities for what is almost certain to be a tricky period immediately ahead . So far , the stock market has taken account of only a mild recession , but that view may have to be adjusted in coming weeks should a continued barrage of poor economic statistics reveal that a harsher descent is in store . More twists and turns in the face-off with Iraq are also likely to keep financial markets twitching for the next month or so . " The key watchwords for 1991 are safety , first , liquidity , second , and only then rate of return , ' declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beverly Hills , Calif. , investment firm . " Those who lose the least are going to be the biggest winners . ' <p> Although the most defensive posture would seem to call for keeping the bulk of your portfolio in cash , as short-term interest rates spiral lower , cash no longer is king . While you want to stay liquid , having too much cash is increasingly unwise . You are forgoing the opportunity to lock in higher rates for a longer period of time and also losing the chance for capital appreciation , which could turn out to be substantial . The time is definitely at hand to switch the bulk of your cash into longer-maturity government notes and bonds . <p> A continued speedy fall in short-term rates could leave you holding the bag if you stay too short . The rate on three-month Treasury bills is currently heading toward 7 percent , down nearly a point from six months ago . But , according to Salomon Brothers economist Richard Berner , a further drop to below 6 percent is likely in the next half year as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury notes are a good place to move money . The five-year note , yielding a tad under 8 percent last week , is particularly appealing . All such multiyear notes can be easily unloaded through a broker or bank and , as interest rates continue to drop , will be worth somewhat more when sold than what you paid for them originally . <p> Another alternative is to put some of your reserves into intermediate and long-term government bonds . In a recession , interest rates usually decline , making bonds , which rise in price when rates drop , an ideal investment . The longer the maturity , the greater the chance for price appreciation , though volatility also increases the further out you go . Treasuries , backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government , are , in a rare combination , both the safest and the surest investment bet you can make in a tumbling economy . <p> The case for stocks is a little more problematic and depends on just how steep the current recession turns out to be and how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are divided into two basic camps : Those who are looking for a typical mild " cyclical " downturn in the economy and those who see a more severe " structural " shakeout . Three of the four members of our investment round table ( see page 86 ) take the latter view . <p> The consensus , as usual , is cautiously optimistic . This middle ground of economists predicts that the downturn will end in the second or third quarter of 1991 , with gross national product dropping anywhere from one half to 2 percent , on an annual basis . ( The average GNP decline in the eight postwar recessions has been 2.3 percent . ) " The recession will definitely be over by early summer , ' declares Elliott Platt , director of economic research for Donaldson Lufkin &; Jenrette . <p> A " contained depression " is the bleak prognosis of economic forecaster S.Jay Levy . He expects a 4 percent decline in GNP and an anemic rebound . " The problems to be faced in the next few years - unemployment , distressed real-estate markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - make deflation a greater threat than inflation , ' Levy predicts . <p> So far , the stock market seems to be betting on the mild-recession scenario and has not factored in the possibility of a significantly worse decline . Nonetheless , some gurus are already declaring the bear market dead . The Dow , which peaked in July at around 3,000 , then dropped 21.2 percent to a low of 2,365 in October , has snapped back recently and was hovering around 2,600 last week , down less than 6 percent from where it began the year . Individual stocks have been hit much harder , with many of them down 50 percent or more from their 12-month highs . And small stocks , as a group , have been in a bear market for a year now . The Russell index of 2,000 small companies is down 25 percent over the past 12 months . <p> ' We have seen the bottom of this bear market , ' contends Michael Sherman , chief investment strategist for Shearson Lehman Brothers . He expects oil prices to drop , producing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an actual war with Iraq or just a continued stalemate , it seems more likely that the price of oil will go down rather than up , ' he says . Sherman is currently recommending a portfolio split of 65 percent in stocks , 30 percent in long-term bonds and only 5 percent in cash . <p> Other experts believe the recent share-price advance is only a sucker 's rally in a bear market that still has a long way to go . Steven Einhorn of Goldman Sachs Asset Management is telling his firm 's clients to hold only a small position in equities while keeping the bulk of their portfolios in 10-to-15-year government bonds . " Investors should be cautious because the fundamental factors that affect stocks are quite unpleasant right now , ' he says . " The economy is only in the early stages of a contraction of unknown depth and duration , and earnings expectations for 1991 are still much too high . ' Similarly , Michael Flament , senior vice president of Wright Investors ' Service , a Connecticut investment-management firm , thinks stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,000 before it bottoms out , down nearly 23 percent from recent levels . <p> Going global . One option is to look abroad for relief . And U.S. investors have indeed shoveled billions of dollars into foreign stock , bond and short-term cash mutual funds in the past year . ( See story , page 118 . ) But most foreign stock markets declined in 1990 , with the exception of the German market , which was up a slight 1.5 percent for the first nine months of the year . The worst drop occurred on the Tokyo exchange , with a fall of nearly 50 percent before rebounding recently . <p> The dollar 's big drop against most major currencies has cushioned a big part of that fall and , in some markets , has even produced profits for American investors in dollar terms when stocks were lackluster . But the dollar is close to a bottom , in the view of many analysts , and they warn investors to expect a reversal in 1991 that could reduce their returns from abroad - or exacerbate their losses . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecasters believe that the U.S. fixed-income market is more attractive on a total-return basis , and it does n't involve any currency risk . They are looking for long-term interest rates in the U.S. to keep going lower - dropping to at least 7.75 percent from around 8.3 percent currently . And economist Henry Kaufman says long-term rates " could plummet below 7 percent if the recession here spreads into a global downturn . ' The total return for bond investors in 1991 , including both interest income and price appreciation , should equal 12 percent , at a minimum , and could exceed 20 percent . <p> All the same , bond-market investors should be prepared for some setbacks . A temporary upward spike in rates is likely if war breaks out in the Persian Gulf and oil prices jump back to $40 a barrel or even higher . But given the weak state of the economy , a renewed rise in rates could n't last for very long , and the subsequent drop would be even more precipitous . Investors might want to wait to commit all the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 percent of that money now and hold the other 30 percent to put into the market if rates move up in anticipation of a war in the Gulf , ' suggests Donaldson Lufkin 's Platt . <p> The approach or actual start of fighting in the Middle East also could cause stock prices to retreat . But any major setback for share prices could turn out to be a chance to purchase quality stocks at what might be bargain prices . On the other hand , a peaceful settlement with Iraq could cause oil prices to fall toward $20 , improve consumer psychology as well as the inflation outlook and probably set off big rallies in bonds and stocks . <p> Meanwhile , for bond investors with the fortitude to use leverage , extra profits could be made by buying long-term zero-coupon Treasuries , which move up more than regular bonds when rates drop , or by buying government bonds on 10 percent margin through a broker , using stocks and other assets as collateral . On margin , you can purchase $100,000 in bonds for only $10,000 , multiplying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most low-risk way to make money in the year ahead seems fairly clear . Switch your reserves from cash to Treasury notes . The bull market in bonds should continue , so put another large chunk there right now . Stocks , however , are more vulnerable to a further price decline but should become more attractive as the new year unfolds . Concludes Robert Brusca , chief economist for Nikko Securities in New York : " The bond market is the place to be in the first half of 1991 , while the second half is when you start moving back into stocks . ' TOUGH TIMES <p> There have been eight recessions since the end of World War II . Here are the facts : 1948-49 . The postwar boom ended in an 11-month slump . GNP fell 2 percent ; unemployment rose to 7.9 percent . 1953-54 . When defense spending fell off after the Korean War , GNP dropped 2.6 percent , but unemployment more than doubled to 5.9 percent . 1957-58 . This slowdown lasted just 10 months , but GNP fell 3.5 percent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GNP fell by 1 percent . 1969-70 . The mildest dip of all . A General Motors strike in 1970 accounted for most of the 0.8 percent fall in GNP . 1973-75 . At 16 months , the longest and harshest recession since World War II . Oil prices quadrupled ; GNP plummeted 4.3 percent ; unemployment climbed from 4.9 to 8.5 percent . 1980 . In six months , GNP fell 2.4 percent because of tight-credit policies . 1981-82 . A full-blown recession was set off when the Fed fought double-digit inflation by letting interest rates climb over 20 percent . GNP dropped 3.4 percent and unemployment hit 10.8 percent . 1990-91 .
