Back in the early 1990s , when Russia 's Communists seemed to be fading into irrelevance , Gennadi Zyuganov used to visit an apartment overlooking Pushkin Square in Moscow , his arms laden with pastries and other delicacies baked by his wife . The apartment belonged to Alexander Prokhanov , a virulently nationalistic newspaper editor , and the occasion was an unlikely gathering of politicians , generals and intellectuals from the far right and far left of Russia 's ideological spectrum . With little in common save a shared conviction that Boris Yeltsin was destroying the motherland , the members of Prokhanov 's salon would practice running the country together . They would form a mock Cabinet , dividing up the various portfolios among themselves . Deciding who got which job was never easy , but the consensus pick for the top post was always the same . ' ' We chose Zyuganov , " says Prokhanov . " Every time . " <P> What was fantasy just a few years ago is now tantalizingly close to reality . Zyuganov , 51 , the head of the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consensus choice , this time as the presidential candidate representing a broad coalition of opposition parties and movements as well as the C.P.R.F. Leftists of all degrees have joined right-wing nationalists who once viewed communism as anathema . <P> As his success in those mock Cabinets shows , Zyuganov 's politics are malleable . He is , at once , red enough for old-style Communists and white enough for hard-line nationalists . At a late-April meeting with the candidate in the town of Sosnovy Bor , due west of St. Petersburg , an old man with damp eyes and a Soviet-flag pin stuck in his lapel reverently described Zyuganov as ' ' one of the best leaders our party has ever had . " At a May Day rally in Moscow , the heads of various nationalist movements praised Zyuganov as someone who shares their anti-Western , often anti-Semitic beliefs . In St. Petersburg , a man introduced himself as a member of Monarchists for Zyuganov , a contradiction so absurd even the usually dour candidate had to laugh . <P> Prokhanov says his friend is " like velvet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals to so many different constituencies . Because he is so flexible and cautious , as Prokhanov explains it , ' ' Zyuganov is the buffer , the go-between for all sides . All these political trends seem as if they 're struggling with each other , but the idea of compromise is ripening within them . They need Zyuganov , and Zyuganov needs them . Having received Russia falling apart in his hands , he wants to be the one who puts it back together . Russia and Zyuganov have found each other . " <P> In Mymrino , the tiny village in Russia 's Black Earth region where Zyuganov was born , memories burn brightly of the young , towheaded ' ' Genna " leading student brigades to pick potatoes at the nearby Red October collective farm . <P> " He had the aura of authority around him , " says Valentina Antipova , 57 , a neighbor who recalls Gennadi playing the conciliator even as a boy . " Whenever there was a quarrel , he would come out and break it up . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
