A sign at the entrance to Walton , a small community on the western fringe of the Catskill Mountains , proclaims that in 1993 , the village had the best-tasting water in New York State . Reading this claim prompted me to ask a shopkeeper where the local water comes from . " Mountain creeks , " he answered , " plus wells . " " Not from Pepacton ? " I asked . " Nope , " he said , and frowned to acknowledge the incongruity . Pepacton Reservoir is a 6,400-acre impoundment on the East Branch of the Delaware River . Although it 's located just up the valley from Walton , it 's part of the vast water supply system that feeds New York City , over 100 crow-flying miles away . " We built our wells before they started that mess around World War II , " the shopkeeper explains . " I used to play in the fields of the towns they flooded . There 's still lawsuits going on over the damages . " " Funny , " I say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even filter it , I 'm told . " " Filter it ! " he snorts , " Hell , they do n't even meter it . They 're taking showersout of fire hydrants . And to keep it clean up here they practically want us to put diapers on our cows . " The shopkeeper finally stopped reaming the city long enough for me to express genuine sympathy ; my great-grandfather was forced to sell his farmland to Gotham early in the century to form what is now Croton Reservoir , an impoundment in the suburbs . These are just two of the many reservoirs owned by New York City and used to fill the water needs of millions who know little if anything about their existence . Suburbanites en route to jobs in the Big Apple may see these pleasant looking waters daily from their car or train windows without giving them a thought . But a growing number of fishermen know about these reservoirs , and at Pepacton boat traffic has increased , especially since word spread of the 22-pound brown trout caught by a local fisherman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the largest brown trout that Pepacton has produced , but it may be the record for all of the city reservoirs . Those in charge of the water-supply system could n't care less about trophy trout . In fact , if they had their way there 'd be no fishing or boating in the reservoirs , and even stopping to take a photograph would probably be prohibited . As it is , on city watershed property , swimming , bathing , wading without waterproof waders , camping , picnicking , hunting , trapping , skating , skiing , using a motorized vehicle , disposing of bait , being within 500 feet of a dam , or urinating within 250 feet of the high-water mark are all prohibited . Boat launching at Pepacton and other city reservoirs is an arduous process . Only rowboats of a specific size are permitted , and they must be kept above the high-water mark at a designated site . You must have a boating permit to keep a boat here , and if you wish to remove the boat from the reservoir , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a permit at Pepacton , you must show up during the day with your boat . Inspectors will number it , then steam-clean it for zebra mussel protection . At the Downsville office of the New York City Department of Environment Protection , I asked an inspector about boat theft . " Oh yeah , " he said , " it 's a big problem . " Yet despite all the hassles , nearly 3,000 boat permits have been issued for Pepacton . Many hundreds of boats are chained to trees all around the reservoir , and their owners  --  who park along the roadway and tote oars , cushions , rods , bait containers , and fishing paraphernalia down steep banks  --  pull the boats to the water , and row . There 's no guarantee that anglers will land a monster trout to make up for all their trouble , but they can count on finding browns that average between 5 and 8 pounds . The walls of Al 's Sport Shop down in the valley show photos of many such trout annually , as well as 10-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and rigmarole notwithstanding , this mountain reservoir is a fine place to be when the sun rises on a summer morning , while a wispy veil of fog lifts off the water and a slight breeze starts to ripple the surface . You can almost imagine Rip van Winkle sleeping up in one of the hollows , propped up against a very old boat .
