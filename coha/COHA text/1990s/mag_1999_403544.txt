But until recently , this young mother of four could not afford such a luxury . When we first met , she complained to me of chronic leg and lower back pain , which she attributed to the strain of carrying water . Every day , Nyamutondo , her ten-year-old daughter ( her eldest child ) , and another young girl who lived with the family would go to fetch four five-gallon buckets of water for their household . Usually they paid a fee to draw from a neighborhood tap , but on days when water was scarce , they walked half a mile down from their house on Bugando Hill to fill their buckets directly from nearby Lake Victoria . " Sometimes you reach the source of water only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " she explained . " Sometimes those with piped water refuse to sell what they have . Sometimes you go there and they are closed . We never know how far we will have to go to fetch water . " Given those difficulties , Nyamutondo carefully monitored her household 's water use . " Because I have small children and they still wet the bed , I have to use one bucket for washing clothes , " she told me . " We use the other three buckets for bathing . Each one of us takes a small share of a bucket . Any remaining water I use to wash dishes , to cook , and to boil drinking water . " Sometimes , if she had n't earned enough from working as a tomato vendor to buy sufficient water , Nyamutondo did her family 's laundry in the lake . Obtaining clean water in Mwanza , a city of an estimated 419,000 residents , is a problem in part because the existing water and sewage facilities are out of date , in disrepair , and not integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve 15,000 people , less than half of Mwanza 's population at the time . Today it serves about 80,000 people-more than five times its intended capacity but only a fifth of the burgeoning population . The majority of residents must rely on septic tanks or pit toilets-or simply on the outdoors . The sewage system was supposed to pipe waste outside the city for treatment , but the pumps required for this step broke down in 1990 . Now some 925,000 gallons of raw sewage pour each day into a river canal that feeds into Lake Victoria near Mwanza 's busy downtown . Schoolchildren race across three narrow pipes that span the sewage-laden canal , daring one another to risk a fall into the murky waters below , while women selling fruits and peanuts nearby ignore the stench . Meanwhile , just over a mile away , water is pumped from the lake for domestic use . Lake water , the main source for the city , is piped to about eight thousand connections , including scattered public standpipes . This piped water serves about half the population ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the lake , or , to a lesser extent , rivers and springs . Water treatment consists of chlorination ( an antiquated filtration system broke down years ago and was never replaced ) . Calcium hypochlorite is stirred into a bucket of water and then added to one of the small vats that feed the city 's two supply tanks , which together hold 800,000 gallons . Although this task is usually performed several times a day , it is impossible to accurately monitor how thoroughly the disinfecting chemical gets mixed into the contents of the tanks before water is pumped into the city 's distribution system . Many people take the precaution of boiling and filtering their drinking water . Since only the wealthy have electricity in their homes , most city residents who want to boil their water must consume precious fuel , purchasing charcoal or scouring the already strained landscape for firewood . Inevitably , they minimize their water use or resort to unpurified water , which can precipitate illnesses such as intestinal worms , typhoid , schistosomiasis , and cholera . Statistics are hard to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 817 children in Mkolani , a ward in the southern part of Mwanza Municipality , are disturbing . Fourteen percent of the children up to the age of fourteen were infected with schistosome worms , while 25 percent had hookworms or roundworms . According to another study , there were 1,124 cases of cholera in Mwanza during the first six weeks of 1998 , and these resulted in at least fifty deaths . Lacking an adequate supply of pure water , Nyamutondo was not always able to follow hygienic practices she knew would benefit her family 's health . " Some of the people in the household may not bathe daily , although they usually bathe by the next day , " she explained . " It does depend on whether there is enough water in the household , and water availability depends on money . Sometimes you do n't have enough money to buy the things you need to boil the water , and you just have to drink the water as it is . That is why you find that children often fall sick . " Several years earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost two children to unidentified illnesses ; the four that survived suffered frequently from diarrhea . Photograph A faucet is locked , above , to protect a valuable amenity piped water Opposite page : worse in Mwanza than almost anywhere I 've been , " says Peter LeJacq , who worked for ten years in the community health department of Mwanza 's Bugando Medical Center . " You experience all these diseases in Tanzania that you do n't experience in countries where water is more available and soap and toilet paper more affordable . Those three commodities determine body hygiene . " An American priest and doctor working for the Maryknoll Missionaries , LeJacq confronted a sanitation and public health nightmare when he arrived at Bugando Medical Center in 1987 . The center , with eight hundred beds , was one of the four best-equipped hospitals in Tanzania to which patients could be referred . Built at the top of Bugando Hill , it was often the first place in the city to lose water during electrical outages . " There was no water in the hospital , " LeJacq recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads from the storage tank , and that was being filled by the fire truck , which would come and put some dirty lake water in it each day . " Lack of water affected not only medical hygiene but also the most basic sanitation and cleaning . " Many of the more than 150 toilets in the hospital were n't working , " LeJacq says . " When we opened the locked stalls , we found dead rodents and putrefied human waste . What they used to do , when the flushing mechanism was broken , was to use old soup ladles to scoop out the waste . Then they put it in buckets and dumped it in a hole outside the hospital . " LeJacq and the other staff members immediately set about raising funds and implementing improvements in sanitation and water . " We simply , as medical missionaries , were able to keep screaming that water is a priority , " he explains . " No , a CAT scan is not important ; water is important . No , a new telephone system is not important-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sanitation facilities were repaired . In 1994 private electric- and diesel-powered pumps were finally installed at the base of the hill to ensure that water would be pumped up to the hospital even when city pumps were not functioning . Then LeJacq learned just how precious water-supply equipment can be . Within three weeks of installation , one of the hospital 's new pumps was stolen . " The tires were new , according to the tracks , " he recalls . " These were not poor people stealing the pump . We could not put this off to people trying to feed their children . " Fortunately , the pump was replaced within the year , and the pump house is now surrounded by a cage . Standards of sanitation and hygiene at the hospital have been raised significantly . Nyamutondo Gaspari saw her family 's health improve a year ago , when the household obtained a connection to the city 's piped water supply . With help from a local charity , she and her husband spent about $300 to buy and install the necessary pipes-which , unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings to try again , and this time they knew to bury them in deeper trenches . The family can now bathe daily and wash clothes and dishes promptly . The children suffer less from diarrhea , and Nyamutondo no longer experiences the back pain she developed from balancing a water jug on her head . Freed from having to fetch water , Nyamutondo can spend more time selling tomatoes , potatoes , and other products , while her eldest daughter can sleep later in the morning and has more time to study after school . A few neighbors now purchase water from the family 's tap . Photograph Like other hillside communities in Mwanza , Bugando Hill , left , suffers whenever the city 's water pumps fail .

Most rely instead on the city 's public standpipes , a service that was originally free and for which there is now a nominal charge ( filling a five-gallon bucket costs ten Tanzanian shillings , less than two cents ) . For years , the system has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water engineer for Mwanza , explains : " Sometimes it is a problem of electricity ; sometimes it simply takes time to do the repair . " The city rests on an undulating landscape of clay valleys and round granite hills rising as much as 300 feet above Lake Victoria , and neighborhoods at high elevations suffer the most during electricity cuts , for they depend on booster stations to pump water uphill . Residents have responded by developing an efficient informal system in which people fetch and distribute water for a fee . " Normally that is illegal , as only the government is allowed to sell water , " remarks Shoo , " but they are doing it as a practice , and it is not easy to tell them not to . " Even the water vendors do not know from day to day how they will obtain water . One vendor who serves the community on Bugando Hill likes to obtain water from the city tanks at the top of the hill , where the price is lowest . Here he can both save money and minimize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his three-speed bike . When these tanks are empty , the vendor rides halfway down the hill to a church where he obtains water for a slightly higher fee . Often this option is also exhausted , however , and he has to look elsewhere . For a time , he was able to get water from a construction site at the hospital , where laborers and guards sold off water supplied by the hospital 's private tanks . Photograph Above , left : A woman bathes her son . Above : Nyamutondo prepares vegetables // Depending on the source , this young man sells water for four to ten times what he paid for it . Usually he charges 100 Tanzanian shillings ( about fifteen cents ) for a five-gallon bucket . Such high prices are common throughout the developing world , where the unit cost of vended water can be anywhere from four to twentyfive times the cost of water from a piped city supply . People with piped supplies pay at low rates or not at all , because water authorities often do not have the staff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with piped water may in turn sell it to neighbors and vendors at great profit , so the poorest people in the community end up paying the most for the least amount of water . Poor planning , financial limitations , inadequate training , mismanagement , and corruption have all contributed to the poor maintenance of ( and failure to improve ) water and sanitation facilities in many developing nations . But with financial assistance promised by the European Union and the World Bank , improvements are being initiated in Mwanza 's water and sewer services . A massive water-storage tank is to be built at the army base on Nyamashana Hill , enabling the Bugando Hill community and others at high elevations to receive water via gravitational flow even during electric shortages . At the Lake Victoria intake point , a diesel generator will be installed to supply the main network with water when the electricity fails . To improve water quality , both the waste treatment facilities and the water supply 's chlorination units are to be rehabilitated and expanded , and new water filtration equipment is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water nor the sewage system may fully meet the needs of the current population . And Mwanza , like most cities in the developing world , continues to grow , increasing its population by more than 4 percent every year . Photograph A fisherman delivers his catch from Lake Vitoria , right , for weighing by the Ibanda Fish Dealers Cooperative Society . Below : A net is pulled in at the end of the day // John Briscoe , senior water adviser to the World Bank , believes sanitation and water services in developing nations can be increased substantially within the next generation . But to do so , he emphasizes , good management practices must be followed . Until recently in Mwanza , for example , half the water supplied to the city was unaccounted for : the water department spent more money supplying water than it collected in revenue . Running at a loss , the water department was unable to supply water consistently , making customers less willing to pay their fees . And so the cycle continued . In several Botswana cities , meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful collection of fees for services rendered . In this way , the Botswana Water Utilities Corporation was even able to expand . Photograph On Bugando Hill , above , a water vendor fills jugs from city tanks . Left : Vendors deliver water on the city 's outskirts . // Steps toward better management are already being instituted in Mwanza . The national government is improving bureaucratic efficiency by decentralizing the water and sewage authorities . Under new procedures begun in 1996 , Shadrack Shoo explains , the water fees collected in Mwanza are directly allocated for maintenance and improvements instead of being routed through the national government in Dar es Salaam . " Now , if there is a breakdown , we can act fast , " he says . This institutional change has given the local water department added incentive to collect fees , and as a result , revenues have more than doubled . Plans are now in place to rehabilitate the public standpipes , creating a network of seventy hygienic , staffed water kiosks to serve the city . The rationale is that many Mwanza residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private taps or water vendors , and if the government 's service becomes more reliable and accessible , these people will be able and willing to pay the lower public fees . Perhaps most important , in July 1997 Mwanza 's water supply and wastewater management were finally placed under one local authority , the Mwanza Urban Water and Sewage Board , in the hope of ending the kind of fragmentation that has allowed the release of wastewater to despoil the freshwater supply . As Shadrack Shoo explains , " An effective long-term strategy is to protect the water resource at the outset , not to purify it afterward . " Control of sewage is also essential if the international effort to revitalize Lake Victoria is to succeed . The massive amount of human waste currently entering the lake from Mwanza and other cities has been contributing to a reported rise in lake algae in recent years . As dead algal matter sinks to the bottom and decomposes , it reduces the level of oxygen in deep-water habitats , endangering fish species unique to Lake Victoria . With funding from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenya , and Uganda-are now working together to address this environmental problem . The payoffs will be not only improved human health but the preservation and rehabilitation of the world 's second largest freshwater lake .
