<p> WAILEA , Hawaii - Probably I was being misinformed , but I remember hearing in elementary school that the Eskimos of North America had 16 words for snow - one for icy snow , one for soft snow , one for crunchy snow , and so on . This was said to be evidence that we clever , restless humans will discern diversity in even the most bare , elemental environment . A fine idea . <p> Yet here I sit on yet another lazy afternoon in Wailea , along the southwest coast of Maui , sun-drunk , sea-soaked , frond-shaded and skeptical . <p> If ever there were an elemental landscape , this is one . Sun . Sea . Sand Implements for enjoyment of the aforementioned . A winding path leads along a mile and a half of immaculately arranged shoreline . Logo-bearing towels are carefully draped on deck chairs . If we humans are so irrepressibly inventive in our vocabularies , then why do n't Hawaii 's dictionaries include seven words for sun block , nine words for golf , II words for lob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words for reclining patio furniture ? <p> Because at this point in the 29th century , when you find simplicity , the last thing you want to do is complicate it . <p> And even if you have to cross a few thousand miles of Pacific Ocean to reach it , well , the hefty price still may seem worthwhile . So goes the strategy behind Wailea , which opened its first hotel 17 years ago . <p> Wailea 's creators aimed to offer a more luxurious alternative to Kaanapali , the master-planned resort that opened in 1962 along the island 's northwest coast and helped set off the first stampede of mainland visitors to Maui . Given the overbuilding of the Hawaiian hotel market over the last decade and the recent southerly drift of the U.S. economy , it 's hard to guess who will succeed in the long haul . But after a flurry of construction in the past three years , Wailea has emerged as a formidable destination : 1,500 acres , , 2,314 hotel rooms , 250 vacation condominiums , 36 golf holes ( soon to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects agree that the place has become a force to be reckoned with . <p> From Maui 's Kuhului Airport , I steer my rental car 17 miles south until I am surrounded by manicured lawns and the discreet directional signs bearing orange and blue logos. ; It 's late , about 10 p.m. , but at the front desk of the Stouffer Wailea Beach Resort , the receptionist welcomes me with a smile , a lei , a room key . <p> It 's lateCaan-i , the master-planned ' : e- tomers , many Hawaiian hotels . ane <p> Tropical paradise . <p> The next morning , I pad down to breakfast with a 180-degree panorama of tropical paradise spread out before me . The buffet is massive . On a Sunday morning at many hotel restaurants , this meal could pass for brunch and fetch $ 20 a head . Here , as hotels scramble to lure guests with added values , the feast comes free with my room every morning . <p> Upstairs , my room includes a view of greenery and haleakala , the world 's largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normally a $ 245-a-night room for two , with twin washbasins and telephones on the desk , by the bed and in the bathroom . But in the battle for customers , many Hawaiian hotels are throwing in all sorts of extras . Having inquired closely about such possibilities , I am here on a package rate of $ 199 per night , with not only the breakfast but a rental car provided in the bargain . ( This offer is available for a limited number of rooms through Dec. 19 . <p> By this neighborhood 's standards , those rates make the Stouffer Wailea Beach Resort , which opened in 1978 , relatively inexpensive . But it is quite comfortable , its grounds and 347 rooms having been renovated in 1991 , and the service is professional enough to have earned a dozen consecutive five-diamond ratings from AAA . <p> Helicopter to Haleakala . <p> If you 're feeling adventurous , you take a helicopter ride over the crater of Haleakala , clouds crowding around it as evening darkens . Or you drive further south to broad , beautiful Makene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . Or continue south past Makena to the crumbling old lava flows , where a nice man offered to sell me some marijuana and where a road sign warns : " CAUTION : SIMULATED MOON SURFACE . " " ( Apollo astronauts are said to have trained somewhere around here . ) Also , there 's the tennis and golf . <p> Strolling south from the Stouffer toward the other four hotels that together make up Wailea , you first come upon the Maui Inter-Continental Resort , oldest and least expensive of the bunch . The Inter-Continental opened in 1976 and finished a renovation of its 550 rooms in spring 1991 . But the place is still a few paces behind its neighbors . Its architecture is subdued , the grounds more inviting than astounding . But there 's decadence here , too ; it 's just painted in muted hues . <p> Look closely at these rushing waiters and waitresses . To each lounging guest around the pool , they periodically deliver a cool towel for the brow . Also , the 380 rooms are spacious , with big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at - and an hour 's worth of snorkel gear or bike rental is included in room rates . ( Cheapest package rate : $ 250 a night for a mountainview room , rental car included , subject of availability . ) <p> Now we 're at the end of the line , Wailea-wise and the Kea Lani Hotel . <p> The Kea Lani , which opened in December 1991 , is a 450-room , all-suite , neoMoorish creation with gleaming domes , rounded corners and white walls outside , Italian pottery and tapestries inside . It feels quite new , like an architect 's model that awakened one morning and found itself full size and perhaps felt a little bit awkward . It has a wonderfully inviting Italian-style bakery , though ; Caffe Ciao , designed in high but casual style , with pastries and breads baked daily , along with fancy waters , coffees and salads . Room rates fall in the lower-middle range for this neighborhood : $ 325 for a room with a full ocean view , $ 225 for one without . <p> That 's Wailea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther south , there 's also the 7-year-old , 300-room Maui Prince Hotel , a little severe , very Japanese , a secluded place set off on its own . The koi pond is so well stocked that at feeding time it looks like a rippling animated Impressionist painting , heavy on the orange and white . Nearby are six Makena tennis courts courts and 18 holes of golf , with another 18 due in September . The Maui Prince has one of the better package offers in the area , too . Through Dec. 22 , $ 189 nightly rents a double room with buffet breakfast for two and an rental car . <p> All experiences are subjective , of course . But if money were no object , I 'd book first at the Grand Wailea Resort , Hotel &; Spa , then at the Four Seasons , then at the Stouffer , then the Maui Prince , then the Kea Lani , then the InterContinental . <p> Assuming that money is an object - and that current rates hold - I 'd probably go back to the Stouffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kea Lani , then the Grand Wailea Resort , Hotel &; Spa , then the Four Seasons , then the Inter-Continental . <p> When you go : Wailea . <p> Getting there : From Kahului Airport on Maui , Wailea is a 25-minute drive . If you 're planning to leave the resort at all , it 's a good idea to rent a car . <p> Where to stay : Wailea includes five hotels and one vacation condo development . Each hotel offers programs for children . At each , various packages are available that may offer substantial savings from the undiscounted " rack rate " " prices quoted here . <p> Budget-watcher 's reminder : Add a 9.17 percent ; Hawaii hotel tax rate to figures below . <p> Four Seasons Resort Wailea. 3900 Wailea Alanui Dr. ; ( 800 ) 334-6284 .
