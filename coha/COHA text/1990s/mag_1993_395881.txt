The end begins in the summer , the days shorter and blood stops pumping through velveted antlers in a week , perhaps less , the hot fine fur of live summer antlers dries , hanging from new bone like old wallpaper . Antlers harden , life quickens . With hard antlers comes a certain restlessness , much like the first jolt of puberty in a boy . All of us have seen evidence of ( or personally experienced ) that adolescent urge to run across a parking lot and kick some inanimate object through the side of a building . It is like that with a bull elk , though the abused objects differ . One early September morning a bull came down from the Firehole meadows , following the canyon toward the Madison . I first saw him trotting out of the timber , head up , on the highway shoulder , causing a Connecticut convertible to swerve violently . I drove another mile down the road and parked , then ran through the trees to the edge of a certain long meadow . He arrived perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fir with his six-point antlers . He whacked another toward the middle of the meadow , then slowed his trot and stopped to bugle , afterwards grunting four times , belly heaving behind his short ribs like a runner just finished with a marathon . He ate some grass , tilting his head while he chewed as if recalling something about an algebra test that afternoon  --  then bashed three young fir trees as he trotted out of the meadow , bound for the Madison River without the dimmest idea why . Those defeated saplings are the signposts of the rut , often found in timbered canyons thick and deep enough to make you want to bring along spelunking gear . Bulls like it in there  --  the shadows are cool , and usually wet , with spring-seeps easing from the earth  --  but to a human , dusk in the canyon bottoms often feels as eerie as fog on a Scottish moor , especially when an invisible bull bugles near your elbow and two or three others answer from the ridgetops . One of fur-trapper Osborne Russell 's greenhorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world was full of the spalpeens of savages , " a phrase not translatable into 20th-century English but still evoking the effect of wapiti screaming in the dark . What are elk up to when they make that noise ? The best biological guess is that it is some sort of advertising , telling other bulls how big and strong they are . The same sort of ad campaign is held by the North American elk 's subspecific European relative , though the red deer makes a sounding chamber of his mouth and " roars " instead of whistles . Both extremes resulted from the country each deer evolved in : the red deer 's roar carried farther in the forests of Europe and Britain , while the elk 's whistle drifted across the canyons of the semi-arid West . In the past 500 years we 've deforested much of Europe , and pushed elk into thicker places . It takes longer than that for wapiti to evolve , so red deer still roar on the open heath of deforested Scotland , and elk whistle  --  or bugle  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't only a warning to other adolescents . Once on the Madison a big five-pointer , already possessing half-a-dozen cows , kept bugling all through one afternoon , though no other elk were visible  --  or audible  --  up and down the valley . After 2 hours of this he suddenly turned and trotted upriver 100 yards , stopping to listen between each call . Three or 4 minutes later the sound he listened for could finally be heard by human ears  --  a cow elk 's " mew , " coming from the timber above the valley . Three or 4 minutes later she appeared , walking steadily across the meadow , mewing all the way . The bull bugled and trotted to greet her , circling behind as she entered his harem . Meanwhile , one of his other cows headed for a patch of timber , perhaps to get out of the warm sun . He did not like this , and headed her off like a good cutting horse at a branding , running through the timber and using his antlers like hard arms to herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger bulls  --  not spikes but " raghorns , " the two-and-a-half-year-old five-point bulls who herd together a few cows who are n't quite in estrus yet . Once a few of the older cows actually come in heat , usually around the 10th of September , the bigger bulls come out of the black timber . From mid-month to about the 20th is perhaps the prime time to call in a good bull  --  before all the cows have been rounded up , but after the big elk have gotten tired of the raghorn escorts . A bugle imitating a young bull 's high whistle , or a cow-call during this time can bring a six-pointer charging out of the timber , annihilating small ponderosas in his path . The main breeding period in the northern Rockies occurs from the very end of September through the beginning of October . Montana biologists have found that 80 percent of the state 's calves are conceived between September 25th and October 10th . Early in this prime period some big bulls are still operating as " satellites , " trying to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows in a certain canyon are found early by one bull . One September 26th in the Gallatin Range my wife and I found a six-point bull with about fifteen cows and calves , surrounded by the bugles of at least two other bulls . Listening to them in the pre-dawn dark , the lone satellites circling in erratic orbits on the ridges of the herd bull 's canyon , we sneaked to the edge of the meadow where the herd fed , waiting there before shooting fight as sixteen elk fed like noisy shadows against the pale autumn grass until there was enough light to shoot . When I cow-called , the whole herd turned toward me , one big cow and the bull in the lead . They were only 100 yards away when they turned , and perhaps a little over half that when the wind changed with dawn . The herd turned again like well-trained cavalry , breaking timber beyond the meadow more like a herd of elephants than oversized deer . We heard a second crash behind us and turned to see another big six-pointer running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another one crossed the head of the meadow . We were surrounded by frightened six-point elk , something both exhilarating and disappointing . Perhaps that morning panic had something to do with the new herds we found the next morning  --  three smaller bands of cows , each led by one of the six-pointers . That is when bowhunting large elk really gets tough , each herd cull surrounded by a dozen eyes and all the satellites turned to raghorns . Despite all the bugling and posturing and tearing up of saplings , there are surprisingly few real confrontations between big bulls . The bulls at the top of the local hierarchy claim the most cows , and though there may be some reshuffling of harems , fights often do n't occur until well into the rut , as the biggest bulls wear down . Ninety percent of their time is spent bluffing off raghorns or herding their cows into a new canyon to avoid mature bulls ; spare time is spent breeding . A week or two of that , and life catches up , often in the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ October morning in a meadow along the Continental Divide . The herd bull bugled at a distant challenge  --  to locate the other bull rather than to challenge in return . He hoped to sneak his harem away , out of the meadow and into the timber . He was tired and did n't want to fight . As it turned out , he would n't have a choice . The younger bull came on too quickly , charging across a small creek . The herd bull turned toward his harem  --  then realized it was too late , and met the charge in the middle of the creek , cows looking on . The bulls pushed and splashed and grunted  --  and the herd bull broke away and again tried to gather his cows , bugling hard and chasing them across the meadow . But the younger bull , sensing the herd bull 's weariness , ran and cut him off outside the timber . They met again , antlers clattering like varnished hardwood in the cool air . The older bull tried to keep between the younger bull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backed him into the creek . The cold water revived the old bull . They separated and charged again , the cows looking on , rather bored , as the bulls pushed and grunted and the creek turned muddy . For a while it seemed as if the two bulls would fight until all the water had been splashed onto the banks . But the creek could n't cool the old bull forever , and slowly the younger bull began forcing him back  --  at first in short straight surges , and then as the old bull tired even more , in half-circles , the old bull 's hind legs slipping as he tried to keep his balance . Then the old bull turned and ran , not trying to herd his harem because it was n't his harem anymore . The young bull , almost as weary as the loser , stood and drank from the stream . And then he walked to the shore and bugled , to his cows and to any bull listening from the ridgetops . The old bull lay in the cool timber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stood and fed alone in a small meadow in the trees , then bedded again in the timber during the night , listening to coyotes calling in the valley . The next day , neck-sore and leg-weary , he searched for green grass instead of cows , to put fat over his ribs before the snow fell , before the end of the fall . <p>
