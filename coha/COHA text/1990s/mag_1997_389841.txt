Jimmy Stewart did n't just play laconic heroes . He was one . by Richard Lacayo // WHEN JIMMY STEWART DIED , SOME of the music of mid-century America died with him . Though he was born in Pennsylvania and spent most of his life in California , his speaking voice seemed to spring from an ideal American center , both geographic and spiritual , a place of small towns and genial , unhurried people . ( Once asked why he never ran for President , like his friend Ronald Reagan , he answered , " I ca n't talk fast enough to be a politician . " ) And with each passing year , as America became larger and its life more boisterous and intricate , that voice seemed ever sweeter . Two weeks ago it was finally stilled . On July 2 , Stewart was found dead in the bedroom of his Beverly Hills home by members of his household staff . He had suffered for years from failing health and heart problems , but friends say that Stewart , 89 , had simply lost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife , Gloria . " He was kind of hunkering down like an old elephant , waiting to die , " says Shirley Jones , his costar in Two Rode Together and The Cheyenne Social Club . " Gloria 's death was a shock he never got over . " In 75 feature films , including Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , Harvey , Rear Window , Vertigo and Anatomy of a Murder , Stewart took his place in the first rank of leading men of Hollywood 's golden age . And with the classic It 's a Wonderful Life , he became a staple of America 's holiday season . Yet onscreen and in life , he appeared to be utterly unassuming , a man who made being ordinary seem the most appealing thing in the world . " There was no star quality about him , " says Ernest Borgnine , his costar in Flight of the Phoenix . " He was Jimmy Stewart . Period . " Stewart was n't always a Boy Scout . In the 1930s and ' ' 40s he was the datingest bachelor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the ' ' 50s he became one of Hollywood 's first free agents , moving from studio to studio with each new film and negotiating contracts that often gave him what was then an unusual deal : a percentage of the film 's box office receipts instead of a salary . He became one of the richest stars of his generation , with a big Tudor-style house in Beverly Hills . Photograph Though ticket sales tanked , 1946 's It 's a Wonderful Life has become Stewart 's most popular film , thanks in large part to the VCR . Photograph " Jimmy had that quality where you just want to put your arms around him , " says actor Robert Stack of Stewart ( at home in Los Angeles in 1936 ) . // But the life he lived there was double vanilla-happily low-key and unscandalous . Though it took him until the age of 41 to marry , when he settled down , he settled deep , remaining devoted to his wife , Gloria , through 45 years of a marriage that produced twin daughters Kelly and Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house full of cats and dogs . All his life , Stewart happily admitted to a passive streak in his nature . " I do n't act , " he once said . " I react . " Part of his legend insists that he did n't so much climb to the top as float there . His upward drift started in the small town of Indiana , Pa. , 65 miles northeast of Pittsburgh , where Stewart was born on May 20 , 1908 . His mother , Bessie , had attended college , which was unusual for a woman of her generation , and his father , Alexander , was a Princeton graduate who had returned home to run the prosperous family hardware store founded in 1853 . Stewart adored his father and spent much of his life trying to reassure him that acting was a respectable pursuit for a grown man . For his part , the drily funny Alex would rarely admit to more than bemusement at Jimmy 's fame . While not rich , the Stewart family-Jimmy , the oldest , had two sisters-was comfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Pennsylvania boarding school that funneled many of its graduates to Princeton . As a boy he also made a fateful attachment to an accordion that his father had accepted from a traveling carnival performer in exchange for supplies from his store . When Jimmy moved on to Princeton , the accordion went too , his ticket to the Triangle Club theater crowd , which always needed a musicmaker for their theatricals and parties . In 1932 , as he was graduating with a degree in architecture , Stewart bumped into Josh Logan , a former Triangle Club member who had been a year ahead of him at Princeton . Logan would go on to direct such huge Broadway and film hits as South Pacific and Picnic , but in those days he was merely head of the University Players , a small repertory company on Cape Cod . Logan figured his troupe could use a guy with an accordion , and Stewart thought summer stock might be a nice way to meet girls . " You can see my career was almost accidental , " Stewart said years later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was on my way to get the diploma , I would have gone home . " Photograph A Stewart ( at 2 ) had a close family . At every meal , a friend recalled , " all took hands and said grace . " Photograph * In 1945 , Colonel Stewart gabbed as dad Alex tended the family store he once hoped Jimmy would take over . // It was while performing for Logan that Stewart met Henry Fonda , who would become his lifelong friend despite their polarized politics . ( Stewart was an unwavering Republican , Fonda one of Hollywood 's most active Democrats . ) When a Broadway producer offered to give a University Players production a New York City showcase , Stewart went along in a bit part . That meant not only turning down a scholarship to pursue a graduate degree in architecture at Princeton but breaking the news to some pretty skeptical folks back home . " They all reached for chairs to sit down , " he said later . " I think they took it very well-considering . " The play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few roles brought Stewart an MGM screen test and a $350-a-week studio contract . Arriving in California in 1935 , he spent the next six years honing his skills in over two dozen films . " You either got a big part in a small picture , " he once said , " or a small part in a big picture . But all the time you were learning . " MGM , on the other hand , was trying to figure out what to do with him . At 6 ' ' 33 " and 138 lbs . he was too skinny , the thinking went , to be a leading man .

In it he played Jefferson Smith , a political innocent in Congress who is unwittingly sucked into the schemes of corrupt politicians . For the famous scene in which Smith filibusters to exhaustion on the floor of the Senate , Stewart had a doctor swab his throat repeatedly with a harsh mercury solution to inflame his vocal cords and hoarsen his voice . At the same time , as author Donald Dewey wrote in James Stewart : A Biography , the actor was building a reputation as " one of Hollywood 's most tireless womanizers . " Dewey counts Loretta Young , Norma Shearer , Ginger Rogers , Marlene Dietrich , Olivia de Havilland and Dinah Shore among the actor 's companions . Dewey also notes a claim made by Erich Maria Remarque , the German author who was a rival for Dietrich 's affection , that Dietrich became pregnant by Stewart when the two were starring together in the Western comedy Destry Rides Again . Remarque contended that Dietrich , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor Stewart ever acknowledged such an episode , or even an involvement , though others who worked on the Destry set have attested that they were more than just costars . After Dietrich , Stewart became seriously involved with de Havilland , who was coming off her success in Gone with the Wind . By that time film magazines and gossip columnists were earnestly advising the 31-year-old Stewart that it was time to marry . De Havilland once told a reporter that she had refused a proposal from Stewart because she thought it was " a frivolous thing on his part . Jimmy was n't ready for a wife . I guess he still had a few more wild oats to sow . " And quite a few more awards to garner . His performance in The Philadelphia Story in 1940 brought him the Academy Award for Best Actor , which many people had expected him to win the year before for Mr. Smith ( it went instead to Robert Donat for Goodbye , Mr. Chips ) . Stewart might have spent the next year or two consolidating his success . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army Air Corps , a prospect that had horrified MGM chief Louis B. Mayer . He worried not only that Stewart was squandering his hard-won box office position but also that his donning a uniform might set off a stampede of other stars into the service . To Mayer 's relief , Stewart was rejected on his first physical for being 10 pounds underweight , an embarrassthat I would n't make a mistake . " Back home he had a clause written into his movie contracts forbidding studio press agents from mentioning his service record . He always downplayed his accomplishments . " He was a press agent 's nightmare but a wonderful human being , " says his friend Burgess Meredith .

" // Stewart 's first postwar project was It 's a Wonderful Life , which Frank Capra was preparing for his production company Liberty Films . Stewart was glad to be working again with Capra , but returning to the cameras triggered a crisis of self-confidence not so different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-town banker he plays in the film . " I felt when I got back to pictures that I had lost all sense of judgment , " he said later . " I could n't tell if I was good or bad . " He was good . Good enough to win his third Oscar nomination , though It 's a Wonderful Life did such poor business that Capra had to sell Liberty to Paramount . Stewart followed Life with a series of flops , including Rope , a stagy Alfred Hitchcock version of the Leopold-Loeb murder . To his horror , The New York Times cranked up a story about the collapse of his career . " I knew right then and there I was going to have to do something , " Stewart recalled later . " I knew I had to toughen up . " That resolve led him to the roles that made him a star all over again in the ' ' 50s . First there was the 1950 comedy hit Harvey-the story of Elwood P. Dowd , a cordial , small-town drinker , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fourth Oscar nomination . Then came darker roles . In the violent , angry Westerns of Anthony Mann ( Winchester ' ' 73 , The Naked Spur ) , in the tilted dramas of Alfred Hitchcock ( Rear Window , Vertigo ) , in Otto Preminger 's Anatomy of a Murder , there emerged an older , not so innocent Jimmy Stewart-though no less sympathetic , particularly to fellow actors who needed a boost . Kim Novak remembers how he used to calm her nerves on the set of Vertigo : " It was mostly done with the touch of a hand . There was nobody who could squeeze your hand like Jimmy Stewart . " For a while after his return from the war , he resumed his voracious dating habits . At one party he even persuaded Henry Fonda 's wife , Frances , to take aside Kirk Douglas 's date , tell her that she had caught Stewart 's eye and help her sneak out with Stewart when Douglas was n't looking . But as he approached 40 , he was under pressure from family , friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife , Rocky , who came to the rescue by bringing him together with Gloria Hatrick McLean , 31 , a newly divorced mother of two young boys . She had wealth , a famous sense of humor and a passion for golf and African wildlife . They wed in 1949 . And it stuck . " She 's made my life more exciting and interesting and meaningful than I ever thought it could be , " he said in 1992 . Though he worked steadily throughout the ' ' 60s , he would have only one more solid hit , the 1965 Civil War drama Shenandoah . In 1969 he was shattered when his stepson Ron , a Marine lieutenant , was killed in combat in Vietnam . Afterward , Stewart remained a strong supporter of the war , but when a Pentagon rep showed up at the actor 's home to propose using Ron in a pro-Vietnam PR campaign , a furious Stewart took his visitor by the elbow and showed him the door . Yet Stewart remained a conservative in his bones . He and Fonda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1976 , Stewart campaigned widely in California in support of his old friend Ronald Reagan in his failed attempt to win that year 's GOP presidential nomination .

The last of his 75 feature films was The Magic of Lassie in 1978 . Of course he was already enjoying the status of a legend . His voice was a staple for every comic impressionist . ( " Sometimes , " he once said , " I wonder if I 'm doing a Jimmy Stewart imitation myself . " ) He traveled the world with Gloria and received such honors as the Lifetime Achievement Award of the American Film Institute . He was also a fixture on good friend Johnny Carson 's Tonight Show , where he often recited the verses he had published in a surprise 1989 best seller , Jimmy Stewart and His Poems . ( From " The Aberdares ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The North Pole 's rather chilly/Those who 've been there all will tell. / There 's lots of snow and lots of ice/ And lots of wind as well . " ) Stewart also liked to quote a line from Laurence Olivier : " I always play myself , with deference to the character . " These days a whole generation of younger actors can be caught playing Jimmy Stewart . ( Listen closely to Nicolas Cage in The Rock , Kevin Costner in Field of Dreams or Tom Hanks in just about anything . ) What they seem to want is to be like him-a man as simple and straightforward as the alphabet but with just as many possibilities . Jimmy Stewart once proposed his own epitaph : " He gave people a lot of pleasure . " No matter what they may carve into his tombstone , those words will be his legacy .
