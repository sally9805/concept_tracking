Karen pushed away from the edge of the desk . She should have brought a poster along to give her eyes some hold on the blank wall  --  a favorite painting , or that eleven-by-fourteen frame with different size cutouts in the mat , oval and square and rectangular openings , her daughter gazing through them at different stages of her childhood  --  with that drunken look of the self-satisfied baby while breast-feeding , at her fourth birthday party in pink chiffon , riding her BMX bike at age seven , and high up on horseback last spring  --  she 'd just turned fourteen . <p> Oh Lord , what did it mean to have a fourteen-year-old daughter ? Nearer , my God , to thee . . . Karen laughed as if she were sharing a joke , and swiveled her red-and-black office chair around until she grew dizzy . Why had n't she at least brought that horseback photo with her ? of course , knowing perhaps too much about herself ( though she thought it part of the professional obligation of every psychologist to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have dragged out ) , she understood why ; in her daughter 's pride and self-confidence she 'd recognized the adolescent 's itch to leave home , the two-prong thrust of cutting the cord and conquering the world . Her daughter 's father had snapped that sadly eloquent picture against a backdrop of blooming cherry trees early one Sunday last spring , the week before he admitted to Karen his infidelity <p> It would have been too easy to say Heather looked just like Karen when she had been her age  --  henna hair and those high cheekbones from , as family saga had it , some distant Cherokee ancestry ( though nobody in her family had ever checked if Cherokees had high cheekbones ) . But there were quite a few differences between them . For one , Heather 's gaze was more intense , the reflecting calm of a child who could break out into unexpected rage at a suspected offense ; in contrast , Karen had been jumpy and nervous as an adolescent , and she was always predictable . <p> Pleasantly dizzy , she glanced out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake water into particles lighter than air ; on the other shore the village of Varenna had been swallowed by mist . After days of wrestling with her ambitions , she dared at last to admit to herself that she was hopelessly stuck . Not chat her research lacked the substance to enable her to continue , nor chat her cavalcade of scholarly language had broken down beyond a quick fix , no  --  but she had come to realize ( more precisely , recognition had hit her over the head ) that , instead of steering clear of ambiguities , she had run astray from the very beginning . What baffled her most was their fact chat not one of her peers had noticed how ridiculous her project was , what irrelevant proportions this whole undertaking had assumed . After the Foundation 's fellowship panel had accepted her proposal and extended an invitation to spend five weeks at the Italian Center , the faculty grants commission of her own institution ( a national , if not world , leader of higher learning ) had awarded her the transcontinental travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it occurred to anybody that her hypothesis of a psychoreactive reciprocal premonition between rider and horse was simply off the wall ? <p> She decided to leave her cell and go for a walk , maybe row for an hour , clear her head . She closed and locked the window , fully aware chat here , in this private estate where- only peers moved about freely , protected from the world by an eight-foot barbed-wire fence and a sophisticated video surveillance system , her perpetual fear of burglaries was silly . She pushed back the heavy iron bolt on the door . Built above a former chapel , her study was a short walk from the main villa . A few years ago , combatting dilapidation in order to restore what had , in fulfillment of the Principessa 's will , become an international scholars ' retreat , the architects had paid remarkable attention to detail , as this door attested  --  although there was a sleek modern lock from the outside , they had preserved the long heavy bolt inside . Whenever she put her key into the hole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shut . <p> Undisturbed by the gravel crunching under her feet , the birds in the cypress trees persisted in their sweet cacophony . Goddammit , her worst fears might very well come true : she might have to return to the drawing board altogether , retrace the horse races , play back the hours and hours of videotape. one thing she was sure of : there had to be a powerful connection between human and animal , especially in competitive situations  --  a secret no one yet had been able to decode scientifically , a mystery defying both traditional analytical thought and attempts at computerized deconstruction <p> Before reaching the path leading down to the lake , Karen had to make a slight incline . Fighting the dense humid air , she paused directly below the villa to catch her breach . She struggled with her cliched sense of awe that befell her every time she took in the enchanted beauty of this site . Jeffrey surely did n't deserve this grandeur , she thought , and felt a surge of triumph . A crumbling statue of a lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eighteen years , from her junior year in college all the way up the educational ladder , from the thrift store-furnished student shack to the four-bedroom house with Jacuzzi and wet bar , eighteen years with that creep  --  Karen laughed out loud , a short , bitter snort . <p> The yellow two-story building on the waterfront used for international academic conferences obstructed the pier so she could n't make out if the rowboat was in its berth . The lake was still shrouded in fog , the wind and waves meek . Karen trusted she could manage the skiff by herself as long as she stayed close to the shore . She 'd rowed it before , pulling the oars through the tepid water in the company of two sweet and only moderately depressed wives of distinguished scholars . Such exercise countered the recent discouragement she 'd felt because of her gradual weight gain . If she could make a habit of rowing for the remaining weeks , as well as muster the strength to resist second helpings at the sumptuous lunches and dinners , . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might end up better off than when she arrived . <p> This prospect elated her ; she dashed downhill , feeling suddenly lighter as she took each switchback with a spray of gravel . For the moment it was absolutely beyond her how she had ever gotten involved in this foolish discipline in the first place  --  and had become good at it besides , quickly establishing herself as a leading specialist in the psychoanalysis of man/beast interaction . After all , promoted to full professor in one of the foremost departments in her field at age thirty-eight . . . <p> The boat was gone , so she sat down at the dock and let her feet dangle in the gray-green brine . Come on , spill it out , she demanded of herself in a loud voice . She remembered her husband 's sweaty paw on her belly : Got to watch it , kid ! Initially Jeffrey had also been granted a fellowship for his lifelong project on the history of American anthropology . God , was she glad  --  relieved was the better word  --  that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have blown his brains out . Why do male professors in their forties find mindless titless assless coeds so hellishly irresistible ? <p> Her heels brushed the soft layer of algae clinging to concrete . She tried to imagine herself in bed with some of the better-looking boys in her classes , those healthy twenty-one-year-old hulks with pink baby faces and immaculate bodies . Pure physique . . . the thought made her snort . Years ago she and Jeffrey played tennis daily ; he 'd always been hyper-conscious of staying in shape . Poor prisoners of our psyches , she thought ; for want of a gun she had pursued him with the largest knife she could pull from the butcher block on the kitchen counter , chased him all over the house and out the door . It must have looked hilarious , a scene from a soap opera . When they met at the fanciest restaurant in town to " talk it over " a week later , he suddenly stopped stabbing his filet mignon and admitted , Shit , he 'd really feared for his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was luck  --  the banal fact that our kitchen has two doors so I could n't corner you and slice you up . " <p> At the restaurant they had acted as adults . Adultery . So what ? It was over . Let 's remain friends ; keep the house and the Volvo . Would you mind if I pick up my computer and books one of these days ? A peck on the cheek , farewell , lover from the salad days : youthful nights perched back to back in the same drab room , hammering away at their theses . He 'd surprised her with a bottle of Moet &; Chandon when she was the first to reach the goal , mortarboard with tassel , purple-rimmed black gown : Ph.D. , the sacred knighting of academia . But she could tell he was jealous  --  distracted , and later in bed a bit cruel , his lovemaking as rapid and single-minded as an agitated monkey Out of the mist the boat appeared , surely the most beautiful thing on the lake . What a sight it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthroned herself in the oaken gondola to glide past the romantic scenery of the indigent fishing village bordering her property , nodding from her imperious cane-backed seat as she acknowledged the humble greetings from native fishermen fixing their nets in the ragged little harbor ; then she commanded her tanned and muscular galley slaves ( probably secret members of the communist oarsmen 's union ) to let the boat drift homeward  --  home to the groomed estate with its six dozen invisible gardeners and obedient servants ! Glorious empire conquered with American booze money , latest jewel in the crown of the heiress from Detroit who had transformed herself into Italian royalty , Her Serene Highness . . . <p> " Hi , guys , have a good outing ? " Karen yelled , but the law professor and his timid wife did n't respond . Surprisingly synchronized but as if in slow motion , they jabbed their oars into the water . When they finally managed to pull alongside the dock , Karen saw that the woman 's face was a mask swollen from sobbing , and the regal visage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was distorted with a high-pitched rage . Karen recalled hearing shouting and crying from their direction that morning  --  their bedroom was on the second floor of the villa , separated from hers by the servants ' staircase . She had sat up in bed , the red queen-size bed where she and Jeffrey would have woken up , exhausted at the mere thought of each other . . . the bed that was Karen 's alone now . Although she tried to listen , no words made it through the walls , only the diffuse frequencies of a quarrel which subsided a few minutes later while she hunched on the toilet grimacing , still stuffed from last supper 's gormandizing . <p> They were about her age , a little older perhaps , and had arrived at the villa the same week . By Anglo-American standards they were quite good-looking , both of them trim with vibrant complexions ; he had grayed in the way some people choose to call distinguished . over the past few weeks they 'd exchanged the requisite platitudes- " Are n't we lucky our kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it was harder work to have fun with them than with most of the other guests . Karen envied them because they seemed to need no company but their own . Every night before dinner one could see them jog down to the lake and back up the steepest paths to the tennis court to play a discouragingly competent game before hopping off to their showers and into exquisitely fitted formal clothes . The first evening Karen had complimented the wife on her dress and her perfume and received a self-assured thank you . " Yves St. Laureat 's latest fragrance , " the wife of another eminent scholar had whispered over fettucine Alfredo . <p> After dinner the law professor and his wife usually would sit in the reading room for a while , leafing through newspapers and sipping Sambuca . They retired to their bedroom while most other guests were still engaged in conversation or congregating around the piano to croon show-tune oldies . <p> " Any problems out there ? " Karen ventured again ; the law man had leapt out first , as his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunge overboard . <p> " No , no , " he replied , " no problems at all . It 's quite pleasant  --  too wind to speak of . You 'll enjoy it . " <p> Karen reached out her hand to help the woman , whose palm felt hot and slightly swollen . <p> " A marvelous boat , " the woman said , aloof ; she obviously did n't care for a conversation at all . She hurried after her husband , who had not bothered to wait and was several energetic strides ahead . <p> Karen struggled to maneuver the boat away from the dock and through the narrow passage leading from the estate 's small private pier into the lake ; once out , she pulled across the water 's expanse with increasing ease . For a while , she rowed steadily , and by the time she curved around the sheer gray cliff and the town 's small sailboat harbor came into sight , she was breathing hard and her palms and lower back ached . She pulled in the oars and sat for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocks overhung with brushwood . All was n't lost with her project ; maybe she just needed a break to regain a perspective . <p> Her breathing slowly returned to normal . How amazing that Heather had chosen a camp in Vermont this year , one dedicated to astronomy and space physics instead of last year 's dude ranch ! How could one replace a horse with something as abstract as space ? Karen 's own handsome Arabian  --  would he show some distress when she mounted him again after so many weeks ? or jealousy , even ? <p> A delicious shudder shook her when she realized that she had not wasted a single thought on Jeffrey for the last half hour . By now the mist obstructed the view across the lake completely ; even the cliff was shrouded in a layer of condensation . She drifted into a dreamy state of mind , only to be roused by a distant sound  --  tender like a splash , quite distinct from the rewing engines of the occasional motorboat . She felt the sudden chill of a breeze  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south . Time to return for lunch . Stay away from the Bloody Marys , she admonished herself lightheartedly . <p> The return trip proved less easy ; she had to fight waves and wind while the mist lifted fast , and the air , as always at this hour , became translucent again . It seemed like she was barely moving forward Finally she made it around the bend of the cliff and into the home stretch . Three boats drifted right below the overhang , " Policia " painted in large white letters along their sleek lines . A diver jumped into the water as men in uniforms gesticulated at Karen . <p> " What 's going on ? " she shouted , but they yelled something in Italian and turned their backs . <p> Two days later , near Varenna , a canoeist happened upon the law professor 's wife ; the Breva had swirled her bloated body all the way to the other side of the lake . The law professor had told his story in tears : after handing over the boat to Karen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the cliff ; his wife had ventured beyond the wooden railing to get a better view and slipped , disappearing over the edge of the precipice . Since there were no eyewitnesses and the coroner examining the corpse found no wrongdoing , the remains were released within a matter of days and flown back to the States , accompanied by the grieving husband . <p> After the incident the mood in the villa turned somber . There were no more nightly congregations in the music room ; no sentimental tunes from earlier decades floated out of the ceiling-high terrace doors . For days the guests communicated in whispers and kept to their own affairs . only the servants , those great local actors of civility , went about their business as usual . <p> Karen kept her mouth shut . After all , she was just a research shrink , as her brother preferred to call her ( he 'd always enjoyed upsetting her ) , just a professor of psychology pursuing a chosen line of specialization to the best of her abilities . And since she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it prudent to grant her intellect a much-deserved rest . So she swiveled in her office chair most mornings , portable computer shut tight and the annotated translation of Simplicius Simplicissimus , a seventeenth-century German novel , in her lap instead . She 'd found it in the library one afternoon during a fierce thunderstorm that kept her from getting back to her chapel study . From time to time she nibbled at one of the sugar wafers the maids always placed next to her pillow when they turned down the bed for the night . She avoided staring at the whitewashed walls , and when she looked out the window to watch the Breva lift the mist and Varenna come into sight again , she rose ; by walking briskly she could make it to the villa just in time for the one Bloody Mary she now granted herself each day . <p> <p> By Fred Viebahn <p>
