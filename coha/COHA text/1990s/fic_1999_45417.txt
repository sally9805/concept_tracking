Since Verona disappeared , JB quit the Wonder Wheel and started spending all day in the yard . I came home right after she left , and suddenly he seems old . He worked at the amusement park for twenty years , since I was a little girl . Now he sits in a lawn chair , stares at nothing , chews Indian tobacco he shakes out of a silver can . From the back porch , I watch him call the neighborhood kids over to the fence . " I 'm gon na let you all in on a secret . I 'm gon na tell you something you do n't know , " he says to Sammy and Mary Beth Huddle . Both children have white blonde hair and eyes the color of sour milk . They stand there , solemn , staring at JB through the fence like they 're at church . Even I know these kids would believe anything . <p> " You ever see those pure breed horses down at the race track ? " he asks . Sammy and Mary Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nights at the track ; their father probably bets quinielas all the time . " Well , listen . When those horses get worn down and tired out , the owner of the track , he drags them out in the field behind the stables , takes out his pistol , and shoots them in cold blood , right through the heart . Then he chops the horses up in little pieces with an ax . Do you know what happens next ? " The children 's eyes are wide , horrified , and JB lowers his voice . I hold my breath . I think I know what 's coming . " He turns those horses into Elmer 's Glue , the kind you use at school . " I let the air rush out of my lungs . Sammy starts to cry . <p> " Mr. Sure , you are an awful man to try to scare us like that , " Mary Beth yells . " I 'm going to tell my mother on you ! " Grabbing Sammy 's hand , she pulls him away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's my turn . I walk quickly across the grass to his chair . " Why did you do that ? How many times have I told you not to do that ? " I look hard into his eyes , trying to stare him down . <p> JB looks back , his eyes blue and level . He spits a wad of tobacco into the grass ; it lands right near my shoe . " You were listening , " he says . " I was gon na tell the one about the little girl who was buried alive . She kept screaming and clawing at the dirt for air . " <p> " Look , let 's go inside . I 'll fix you lunch , " I tell him . " Come on . " I set my hands under his arms to try to lift him from his chair . <p> " Lay off , lay off . I 'm not a goddamn invalid . I know how to get up from my own chair . " <p> Inside , he lies on the floor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okra in the kitchen . Since Verona left , that 's all he 'll eat : okra and mustard on white bread . After he reported her missing and there was a notice- " Lost Child " - in the Gazette , the ladies from the neighborhood felt sorry for JB and brought over macaroni salad and loaves of braided bread . " Funeral food , " JB told me later . " They think Verona 's dead . " JB never touched the food , left it on the counter , still wrapped up for weeks . At first , the ladies would occasionally make excuses to drop by his house , hinting that they needed their dishes and containers back . JB says he ignored their hints . Sometimes , he told me , he did n't even get up from the floor to answer the door bell . <p> Now these same women hate him . No one comes by . He says , " I give their children such bad dreams at night . " <p> JB is my father , but I have never called him " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name-Jake Bartlett Sure-just by his initials . He 's seventy eight , old enough to be my grandfather . I was born when he was fifty-six . <p> He knew he was too old to adopt Verona , so he bought her , paid two thousand dollars , all his savings , to her mother , a girl who worked at the cotton candy booth at the amusement park . Even now , JB loves to tell the story . During her shift , when she was on break , she used to walk over to the Wonder Wheel and she got in the habit of drinking cokes with him and talking . He found out her secrets : how her mother came home drunk , how her brother and his friends smashed windows at the City High gym , how she was flunking everything but French . <p> One afternoon at the end of the summer , she stood by the Wonder Wheel and cried about her boyfriend . A month later , when she came to tell him that she found out she was pregnant , JB offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Picayune since I left college . I quit Mississippi State in Starkville in the middle of my freshman year . Other people 's fathers would have been mad , would have yelled , made threats , demanded that their daughters come right home . I told JB . " I do n't want to go to school anymore . " <p> He said , " Suit yourself , Bella . That 's okay by me . " <p> I was disappointed that was all he said . I had written out a list of reasons in case he asked : I hated Starkville , hated the small talk at fraternity parties while the girls stood in a line , the football games and drinking beer . I could n't find a single friend . <p> I moved to Picayune because it is halfway between Starkville and Money . In Picayune , I lived in an apartment above a garage and paid the rent by baby-sitting for all the families up and down the street . My apartment consisted of two tiny rooms my landlord called " the mother-in-law suite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his wife 's mother would never live in his backyard . I spent the day with other people 's children . At night I read the textbooks from the courses I had never finished-physics , introductory Spanish , social psychology . Each night I waited for JB to call . <p> I lived in Picayune until the doctor at the downtown hospital in Money called to advise me to come home . Mrs. Hood , JB 's neighbor on the right , had reported him to the police and for some reason the officer in charge sent over an ambulance . The doctor said to me , " We 've done tests and there 's nothing wrong with your father that we can find . We think you may want to see him . " <p> " Has he been asking for me ? " I said , feeling hopeful . <p> " Well , frankly , no . A neighbor informed us that Mr. Sure had an older daughter and gave me your name . " <p> That day , I drove all the way home and stopped at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the downstairs lobby , wearing red pajamas and sitting in a wheel chair . <p> " The nurse tied me in this damn thing , " was the first thing he said . " She 's afraid I 'll pick up and run away . " <p> " Hi , JB , " I said . " My car 's outside . I 've decided to come home for a while . " <p> " I figured that , " he said . " Come on , untie me now . " <p> We drove home in silence . I was afraid to ask what happened . I was afraid to look at him , and I sneaked quick glances in the rearview mirror to the back seat , where he had insisted on sitting . A cigarette burned between his fingers ; he stared blankly out the window . <p> " So , where has Verona been all this time ? Who took care of her while you were in the hospital ? " I finally asked . <p> " Do n't you know anything ? Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows raised . " That 's just it-my little girl Verona ran away . " <p> Why do I dream about the Wonder Wheel every night ? In my trundle bed , on the mattress that slides out from under my real bed for the slumber parties I never had in high school , the bed Verona slept on , I lie on top of the sheets and blankets , naked and shivering . I do n't wear a nightgown because I am testing JB , waiting to see what he would say if he ever knocked on my bedroom door and came in to tell me goodnight . He never comes and I am always cold . <p> I take the little green pills JB got a prescription for at the hospital . After he threw the little slip of paper in the trash- " Why the hell do I want to be passed out cold when they bring Verona home ? " -I fished it out , took it downtown , and bought the pills . I used to imagine that sleeping pills wiped your mind clean and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that 's wrong . <p> Over and over I dream the same nightmare . <p> He stands beside the wheel , in the red uniform he used to wear with JB stitched over his front pocket and Wonder Wheel in curlicue letters on the back . He lifts me on , fastens the metal bar across my lap . A child waits in every seat . Dropping the needle on the record to begin the calliope music , he reaches for the crank to start the wheel 's rotation . In my seat , half way up from the ground , I 'm breathing quickly , my fingers gripping the bar . <p> Then everything goes wrong . On the ground , the crank slips away from JB 's fingers and the wheel spins too fast . The music speeds to a roar . JB is a blur of red , his arms raised , waving good-bye . The wheel loses me . I tumble into the air , wind filling my jacket like a sail , bearing me up into the sky . Through the clouds , JB and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating away from home toward a stretch of open sky . <p> Every time , I wake up sick and dizzy , sweating , my skin sticking to the sheets . Things are backward here : I 'm dreaming JB 's dreams . From her side of the fence , Mrs. Huddle whispers to me , " I 've seen it . Your father watches that aquarium like TV . Do n't you care ? " <p> I glance over at JB who is slouched in his lawn chair . His eyes are closed , but I know that if I walked up to him , he 'd snap them open and insist that he 's not sleeping . " He bought the aquarium for Verona , Mrs. Huddle . He 's attached to it , I guess . " I try to sound casual . It worries me that JB spends whole nights with his face pressed against the glass of the aquarium . Everything inside has died except two damselfish and the pieces of pink coral . <p> " And another thing , Miss Sure , " Mrs. Huddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate and distinct . Since I came back here , no one in the neighborhood will call me by my first name . I 'm now " Miss Sure " to all the ladies , the " Miss " stressed , held longer on the tongue to point out the difference between me and them . " I 'll admit the situation 's sad . But there 's no excuse for his lies . " <p> I smile . " I 'm sorry . I 'll talk to him about that again . I know Sammy and Mary Beth were scared . " <p> " How do you know ? " she says . " You saw it ? " She steps away from the fence and sets her hands on her hips . " You watched him terrify my children and you did n't do anything ? What is wrong with you ? " She does n't wait for an answer . " In my opinion , there 's something wrong with that whole family , " she says , pointing her finger past me at JB 's house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across her yard . Her screen door bangs . <p> I watch her go . That whole family is just JB and me . JB 's wife , Jeanette , was nineteen when she had me . JB married her the day after she graduated from high school . She ran away from Money two weeks after I was born and did not come back . I could hear the women , the older ones in the neighborhood , talking ; I dreamed their conversations in my head : " Do you think she 's crazy ? " " Must have been some terrible case of the baby blues . " Now Jeanette has been gone for twenty-two years , and I do n't think anyone remembers her face or cares to guess about why she might have left . <p> I do n't have any memories of my mother . <p> I sit on the grass , Indian style , at his feet , and JB tells me again about the night Verona left , how when he found out she was gone , he threw Verona 's clothes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I imagine the scene-dresses crumpled in the grass , porcelain dolls face down and cracked on the concrete walk , wooden blocks strewn in the flower beds . I have never seen Verona , but I can imagine Verona 's things because I remember that at one time , long ago , they were mine . <p> " So then what happened ? " I ask . I know the answer to my question . I have heard the story before . <p> " Well , for Chrissakes , hold your horses . Give me a minute . I got ta remember the whole thing . " He shakes tobacco out of the can into his hand , sets a wad between his back teeth . I know that he is stalling , a story-telling trick he uses to create suspense . I do n't even mind . I look up at the dark sky and take a deep breath . <p> All I know about Verona is what she left , the broken toys and dirty clothes the neighbors swept off the sidewalk and stuffed in a garbage bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of how JB raised Verona . I ca n't imagine him with a child . He claims she lived with him till she was five . <p> When he told me on the phone that he had bought a little girl , a baby , I told him I would never visit . " You do n't need me , " I said . " There 's no reason for me to come home . " <p> JB said , " That 's fine . " <p> I did n't say , everyone is going to laugh at you if you bring that child home . <p> I know JB has pictures of Verona . He stacked all the photographs on closet shelves , pushed them underneath folded clothes in drawers . But , every once in a while , I imagine him looking for a shirt or a certain pair of socks , and all of a sudden there she is , his daughter , smiling , staring up at him through glass . <p> " Now I know what happened after I found out Verona left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expression is suddenly sad . " You 're not even listening , Bella . I can tell . " <p> " I 'm right here , JB , " I say . " I 'm always here . " I sigh , lean all the way back in my chair . <p> This morning , Mrs. Carter who lives in a house across the street , calls to invite me over for afternoon tea . I dress up for the occasion , in a linen suit I bought for college and high heels . Tea is what ladies drink , I tell myself , brushing my hair , though Mrs. Carter does n't strike me as much of a lady . Ten years older than me , she wears house dresses with sagging pockets , crochets afghans , and runs the Baptist Church bake sales . <p> But , when I get to Mrs. Carter 's house , inside her kitchen , all the women who live at this end of the street are seated around the table . There are no cups or saucers . Nobody is serving tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to figure out what kind of joke they are all playing on me . <p> Mrs. Huddle speaks first . " Miss Sure , you must be wondering what you 're doing here . The problem is , of course , your father . " She smoothes her skirt over her knees . <p> " Oh , " I say . " Well , can I sit down ? " Nobody moves . I stare at the toes of my pumps . <p> " You have n't been home in a long time , so we ca n't expect you to know what it has been like for us . You have no idea how it 's been , " Mrs. Carter says . <p> " I guess not . " I feel sweat beginning to slide along the collar of my jacket . <p> " Let 's tell the story of what happened , " Mrs. Carter says , looking around at the other women . <p> Mrs. Hood begins , " I 'm in the breakfast room , stitching the middle part of the pattern of my quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture window that looks out onto his yard . Well , I do n't like shades or curtains so I leave that window bare to let in light . I happen to look up one time , and there 's your father , " Mrs. Hood pauses to turn to look at me . " Your father is leaning over the fence that divides your yard from mine and holding onto Shannon . " <p> " The poor little girl , " Mrs. Huddle breaks in . " He 's twisting her arms and yelling . Shannon 's crying . " <p> " I can see the tears running down her face even from that far away , " Mrs. Hood goes on . " Well , what do you think , he 's smiling , that 's what gets me really mad . For a minute , I 'm so mad that I 'm paralyzed-they say that happens at moments when you 're truly scared-but then I run straight out of our house , nearly fall down the back steps , that 's how fast I 'm going , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He holds on tight . He wants to steal her daughter . She screams and pulls her away and carries her inside , " Mrs. Carter adds . <p> " She locks all the windows in the entire house and shoves the kitchen table against the back door , " Mrs. Huddle says . <p> Mrs. Hood interrupts her . " Shannon is throwing up . I hold her on my lap in the bathroom till she 's through getting sick . I soak some vinegar cloths for her head-she feels like she has a fever . Then I ask her , what was it , tell me sweetheart , what did that man say ? " <p> " Tell Miss Sure what her father said , " Mrs. Huddle says . <p> " He gave Shannon a piece of Wrigley 's spearmint and told her to chew it up good and then swallow it . Then , as soon as she did , he told her she was going to die because the gum would stick together all her insides and stop her heart ! " Mrs. Hood leans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of telling her story . <p> " Oh God , " I say in a half-whisper . The ladies have talked to me before , but not together , never in a group against me . Part of me wants to tell them that I know JB is mean and wrong to lie . And then there 's the other part : the ladies would never believe me if I told them JB 's not cruel . <p> " You ca n't possibly understand , Miss Sure , what Margaret has gone through , since you have never had any children , " Mrs. Huddle tells me . I set my tongue between my teeth . " Your father is destroying people 's families . " She says the word families particularly loudly , and the other women nod . <p> When I finally leave Mrs. Carter 's house , after promising over and over to confront JB , I walk downtown . I take off my shoes and walk barefoot on the hot cement . JB used to tell me when I was little that burning pavement toughened up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Indians , " he 'd say . " They ran around on hot coals for Chrissakes . " <p> I know I 'd better have another talk with him . So far , I have n't tried too hard . If I make JB mad , he will ignore me , and I 'm afraid to have that happen . A few times , I 've brought beer or a glass of whiskey out to the yard to please him , sat on the grass beside his chair and said , " Why do you keep scaring kids ? It 's mean . " He laughs . <p> JB would like the story of the scene at Mrs. Carter 's house , if he would ever listen to me tell it . But he does n't want to hear my stories ; I know he has never once told anyone a story about me . <p> First , I refill JB 's prescription with the empty bottle I keep in my purse . Then I go over to Money Feed and Supply and buy a salt-shaker size container of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store , I wrap the fish food in yellow tissue paper and tie it with a ribbon bow . <p> At home I walk straight into the backyard . " I 'm here , JB , " I call as I unlatch the gate . <p> " Yeah , " he yells back . " I hear you , you do n't have to scream it to the neighborhood . " <p> " What have you been doing today ? " I ask , pulling my skirt up over my knees to sit down beside him on the grass . <p> " What the hell do you think I 've been doing ? I do n't have anything to do . Has the mail gotten here yet ? " He pushes his baseball cap farther down over his eyes . " Jesus , this sun is awful . " <p> I reach into my purse . " I forgot to check the mail , sorry . " <p> He pushes back the cap and looks at me suspiciously . " Why are you all dressed up ? You go someplace ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt like looking nice for a change . " Standing up , I turn one time around for him . " Do you like this suit ? " <p> " It 's alright with me , if you want to be fancy . Now sit back down . You 're making me dizzy spinning around and around like that . " JB leans forward in his chair to slap a fly off his knee and the tobacco can falls off his lap . " Get that , will you ? " <p> " I have a present for you , JB , " I tell him . " But if you want me to give it to you , you have to close your eyes . " <p> " What do I need a present for ? " Then he looks me in the face . " Hey , do you have some news about Verona ? Is that it ? " <p> " Shut your eyes . " I hold the wrapped-up package behind my back . <p> " Alright . just a minute . " He closes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen JB 's hands close up in a long time . They look old , wrinkled , like elephant skin , cracked , with dirt rubbed in , his nails split and yellow . " What 's going on ? " he says . " I 'm waiting . " <p> Setting the package in his hands , I close his fingers over it . " Surprise . " I wait . <p> JB cuts the ribbon with his teeth , rips the paper off with one quick tear . He turns it over in his hands . " Fish food ? Why the hell are you giving me fish food ? " He stares at me . <p> " For the aquarium . Verona 's aquarium , " I tell him . " To feed the damselfish . I know how you love that aquarium and those last two fish are going to die if you do n't feed them . " <p> " Why should I care if the goddamn fish die ? " JB throws the shaker on the grass . " What makes you think I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're always out there looking at it , " I say helplessly . " I do n't know . It was Verona 's . I thought you 'd want to save it . It 's the only thing you have left that belonged to her . " <p> When I say that , JB stands up . With a shock , I realize how small he is . " Verona 's coming back , " he yells , " and she can feed her own damn fish ! " The cap slips off his head as he walks back into the house , muttering something under his breath that I ca n't hear . For two days after the fish food present , JB wo n't talk to me . When I wake up in the morning , he 's already sitting in the yard , and he refuses to come inside until I go to bed . I carry trays of food , okra sandwiches and cokes , outside and leave them on the grass . " I do n't want you to starve anyway , " I tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third day he breaks the silence . I 'm in the kitchen , chopping vegetables , and I hear , " Bella , Bella , get out here . I want to tell you something . " I run right out , thinking maybe he has considered things and wants to apologize . <p> " What ? " I stand before him , pushing the hair off my face with the back of my hand . <p> " Listen , you know what could have happened is that Verona 's mother stole her back . " <p> The way JB tells it now , Verona made up her bed to look like she was in it , asleep . She hunched the pillows up underneath the quilt in the shape of herself and climbed out the bedroom window . " She had a rope her mother made her out of towels and that 's how she got down , " he says . <p> We 've been out in the yard for what seems like hours . I nod , covering a yawn with my hand although he ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , she was waiting in the car in front of the house . She hid Verona in the trunk and they just drove away . Are you listening to this ? Do I have to tell it all again ? " <p> " I want to go to bed , " I say . " Look , JB , if that 's what happened , then where is Verona now ? " <p> " Hold your horses . I 'm getting to that part . I have to save it for last . " So far tonight , JB has told the story of Verona escaping at least five times . I stretch my legs out on the grass , the linen sticking to my skin , wrinkled and damp . I want to go inside and soak in a long , hot bath . " She 's at the racetrack . " <p> I jerk my head up to stare at him . " The track ? " <p> He repeats , " Verona 's at the racetrack . She 's living there . " <p> Now I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't true . " " How the hell do you know ? You do n't know a thing about it , Bella . I happen to believe that you do n't want me to get my daughter back . " <p> " JB , I 'm your daughter- " I begin . <p> He cuts me off . " Shut up . I remember what Verona 's mother told me . She had this boyfriend , and he was one of those guys who rub the horses down after the races . He works in the stables behind the track . I know that 's where she took Verona . " <p> " You 're wrong , " I tell him , getting up . My legs are stiff from sitting on the grass too long . " I 'm going inside the house now and I am going to bed . I 've had enough of this stuff about Verona hiding out somewhere . " I walk as fast as I can towards the door , without looking back . <p> " You 'll see , " he yells out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'll take back everything you said . " <p> The big red sign reads MONEY 'S BEST : RAIN OR SHINE HORSE RACING NOW . JB pulls me across the parking lot , holding my arm as if I am a child . " Hurry up . We 're going to miss the whole first race . " I let him pull me by my jacket sleeve as we thread our way through the parked cars and groups of men . <p> " I thought we were n't here to see the races . " I am bringing JB to the track because I am hoping this trip will settle something . I am hoping he 'll begin to understand that Verona never belonged to him , that she is gone for good , and that it does n't matter how or why she left , just that she 's not coming back . In the car , on the way here , I realized this is the first time JB has left the house since he came home from the hospital , the first time he will have walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Inside , smoke hangs in the air , curls around the strings of lights . Men are yelling , watching yesterday 's races on a TV set up in the corner . Through the glass wall , I can see the empty track . A truck circles around the track , a rake on its bumper smoothing the dirt . Over the noise inside , the loudspeaker booms , " Daily Double tickets must be purchased before the first race bell . " <p> " I want one , " JB says . He walks up to the ticket window . " Hey , Bella , you got two dollars ? I need to get a program first . " I give him the money and he leads me to a bench , sits down close to me , opening the program on my knees and leaning over me to look . He jams a pencil stub between his teeth . " What do you think about this one ? This looks good to me . " He points to the program . <p> When I was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought home because I loved the sounds of all the horses ' names . I would read the line-up for each race over and over to myself . When I glance around the room now , JB looks exactly like all the other men here , studying his program and writing down numbers . If anyone saw us here , they would never know we were different from anyone else . No one would know the truth about our family . " When was the last time you came to the track ? " <p> " I brought Verona here a bunch of times , " he says , his head bent over the program . <p> My happiness disappears . We 're back to the lies . " JB , you could n't have come here with Verona . Do n't you see the sign that says , NO MINORS ? Children are n't admitted . " He does n't answer . <p> " How about Almost You in second ? " he says . " Come on , Bella , pick one out for me . You decide who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " JB , this is stupid . Are n't we here to look for Verona ? If you 're so sure she 's here , show me .

" JB stands up , holding out his hand . <p> " I am not giving you any more money . " I am trying as hard as I can to sound firm . <p> " Jesus Christ , " he mutters . He turns from me . Back at the window , he uncrumples a wad of dollar bills from his pocket and counts out two . " I 'm for Rough Command and Am I There , " he says . <p> I walk up behind him and grab his arm . " Where did you get that money ? Why did you ask- " <p> JB is already heading out of the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He moves through the glass doors toward the track faster than I 've ever seen him walk . He passes the bleachers . He hooks his feet into the chain link fence and hoists his body over . Then he 's on the other side , on the edge of the path where the horses run . He looks both ways and runs across the strip of the track to the circle of grass in the middle . <p> " Hey , get that guy back here , " somebody yells . " Stop the race ! " It 's too late-the gun shot rings out and the horses start their run , kicking up dust . <p> " JB ! " I yell . " Come back ! " <p> " That your grandfather ? " the man next to me asks . " He 's crazy . " <p> " Wait , JB , " I scream . His name is lost in a roar of voices , men yelling to cheer their favorite horses on . I run outside . <p> In the center of the track , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised above his head , as if he is waving good-bye in slow motion . The horses circle once , then twice , blind to him , intent on moving forward . From where I watch behind the fence , JB is a tiny figure in the middle of a wheel of horses , blurred , unfocused , my father , holding out his arms to me , disappearing in a cloud of dust . <p>
