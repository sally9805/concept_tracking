Prologue The ghost roads . A place of madness . A limbo , a vacuum of nothingness : no sound , not even Buffy 's gasps of shock , no light , just a dull gray that formed no boundary , met no horizon . No heat , no cold . Simply ... nothing . Oz and Angel had tried to prepare her for the terror of the experience , but Buffy Summers , the Chosen One , knew now that there was no way to prepare . By instinct and by training , vampire slayers fought against  --  against a target , an enemy . While every cell in her body screamed at her to defend herself , there was no enemy to focus on . And yet she sensed overwhelming danger . Fists clenched , she took a breath and calmed herself . She released the tension from her body , dangling her arms at her sides . As contrary as it was to everything she knew , the only way to conquer this place was to do nothing . The only defense was passivity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of form and structure , the storm-colored , endless gray , and know that it was ... what it was . It was the ghost roads . As soon as Buffy had the thought , she felt solid ground beneath her boots . Everything snapped into focus and she heard a strange shushing sound . She blinked and saw Oz and Angel standing beside her in their travel clothes  --  Angel in black jeans , a black turtleneck , and a duster , with a duffel bag slung over one shoulder , Oz in a flamingo-pink bowling shirt , jeans , and a denim jacket , with a canvas backpack  --  both of them looking at her with deep concern . The sight of Angel 's dark , deep-set eyes was like a steadying rock as he put his hand on her shoulder and said softly , " Buffy , are you okay ? Are you with us ? " Awkwardly she moved herh all . Slowly she opened her eyes , squinting through the afterburn . Before her stood a barefoot girl about her age , in a long white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried blood . The girl was chalk white , her eyes almost black , and her deep red hair tumbled am her shoulders like a waterfall . She stood alone against a field of black , her outline quite distinct . Buffy had the feeling that if she reached but her hand to the girl , she would touch solid flesh . But there was a strange quality about her , something ethereal , otherworldly . Something that spoke of a land of ghosts . She raised a hand and extended it toward Buffy . Slayer , know me . I am of your house . " Then you must be one of the Southern Summers , " Buffy retorted . " Our side of the family tends toward blonds . She cleared her throat and asked , far more seriously , " Why are you here ? " I was a Vampire Slayer , like you . Though the girl 's lips moved , it was as if a thousand people were speaking . Buffy glanced around and saw brief , blurred images of faces and bodies . People . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many wept . Others were whispering , laughing , almost crazily . When those faded , others took their place . There was a vast multitude of them . The dead who still wandered , seeking journey 's end . Blurring and fading , like a great creature breathing . Like hopes rising and ebbing . Angel stiffened , took her hand , and squeezed hard . Buffy searched the crowd to see what he saw . The only face that remained distinct for her was the dead girl 's . Buffy glanced at Oz , who in turn looked back at her . He said softly , " What do you see ? Who are you talking to ? " " What do you see ? " she asked . He shr ugged . " No one I know . " Then he lowered his voice and added , " But the last time I was here , I saw Kendra . " Buffy frowned . Was this where dead Slayers ended up ? After all the struggle and the relentless fighting , the nothing world of the ghost roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Buffy asked the girl again . The girl raised her chin as tears welled in her eyes . But she was n't sad ; by the set of her jaw and the pulsing vein in her neck , Buffy realized she was seething with anger . I was careless . There was a lad I liked . I thought he was just a stable boy , a nothing . He betrayed me to Fulcanelli and his devils . She raised her chin as the voices emanating from her mouth whispered and echoed the name , Fulcanelli . He was one of them . " Fulcanelli , " Buffy said slowly . " The Sons of Entropy . He founded them , acted as their first leader , " Angel supplied . " Giles read about them in the Gatekeeper 's grandfather 's diary . The first Gatekeeper , Richard Regnier , was a rival of Fulcanelli 's in the court of the French king , Francis I. Fulcanelli engineered Richard 's fall from favor , and they hunted each other all over Europe . " He looked curiously at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see ? " So she and she alone could see the dead Slayer . That creeped Buffy . What was the reason each of them saw different dead people ? " What 's your name ? " Buffy asked . Maria Regina served me in my lifetime . " I 'm looking at Maria Regina , " Duffy told Angel . " Fulcanelli killed her . " She looked at the dried blood . " With a gun , I 'm guessing . " A knife . I was murdered in the year of Our Lord 1539 . And she had been here ever since ? Buffy shuddered . Four hundred sixty years of wande ring the ghost roads but never reaching a destination , not heaven , not hell . Just nothing . So not what she wanted in an afterlife . I was called . To warn you , Slayer . " By the Gatekeeper ? " Buffy asked . I know not . She shrugged in the exact way Buffy shrugged . That distinctive Buffy gesture was something Xander had pointed out to Buffy just the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about what ? " Death walks these roads with you . It would be better for you to turn back . Buffy scowled at her . " And you call yourself a Slayer ? " I was killed . Buffy huffed and gave a short little laugh . " Well , I do n't intend to get killed . " Then turn back . " Angel , " Buffy said , " do you know how to change the channel ? " But his attention was elsewhere . He was staring in the distance , his eyes lidded , a strained expression on his face . In his black duster and turtleneck , he reminded her of a sailor longing for the sight of land . " Angel , what is it ? " she asked quietly . He shook his head . " Nothing . I thought I saw someone . " He returned her intense gaze . " But I did n't . " " Jenny , " she said slowly . He looked away . " Yes . " He was tormented by the memory of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gypsy clan , the Kalderash , wanted it . When , as the evil vampire Angelus , he had killed a beautiful Kalderash Gypsy girl , the Gypsy shaman restored Angelus 's soul to him , along with the knowledge of every foul act , every drop of blood that stained his hands . Then he was Angel , the only vampire to possess a soul , perpetually remorseful , finding no peace ... until he lay in the arms of Buffy . There was love , happiness , and bliss ... the very things the Gypsies swore a lways to deny him . So his soul was ripped away once more , until Jenny died trying to restore it one last time . Buffy tenderly touched his cheek as sympathy and longing swept through her . They could never be together in that way again , never express the love they still felt for each other . It was over . It had to be over . There was no choice . As there was no choice for Angel but to bitterly regret everything he had done and accept with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been done to him . He gritted , " It 's all right . " Buffy slowly lowered her hand and turned back to Maria Regina , the dead Slayer . But she was gone . " Hello ? " Buffy called . Then Oz said , " Whoa . " The space around Buffy , Angel , and Oz filled with wafting as the dead rushed toward them , arms extended , hands open . In rows they came , wave after wave of indistinct bodies and faces , silver tears coursing down their cheeks . Help us . Show us the way out , they pleaded , crushing against each other in their anxiety to get close to the three travelers . Free us . " You hear that ? " Oz asked , as the three backed away . " Intense . " " Loud and clear , " Angel affirmed . Oz looked at Buffy . " What do we do ? " Angel said softly , " Walk away . There 's nothing else we can do . Not today . " Buffy bit her lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel was right . This was not their battle . The wailing rose as the three turned their backs on the sorrowful dead . The shushing noise returned , like surf or ... " A car , " Buffy said . " Look . We made it . " She pointed to a distant night landscape , a boxy black car wound along a country road . Angel said . " Welcome to England . " Rupert Giles felt mortally sorry for Joyce Summers , who sat in an overstuffed chair opposite the couch in the living room on a brilliant mid-afternoon in her home in Sunnydale , the sun splashing the walls like egg-yellow paint . On the coffee table an astounding array of junk food , courtesy of one Xander Harris , was being devoured by same , while Willow and Cordelia sipped their iced teas and nodded at every word Xander said . The Slayer 's mother was clearly terribly confused about what was going on and where her daughter was at the moment . And Xander , unfortunately , was not helping . " Okay , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning forward and spreading his fingers , as if he were about to wade knee-deep into his explanation . " We went to this place called the Gatehouse . This old guy  --  and we are talking old , not just Giles-old  --  " " He 's , like , a hundred and forty , " Cordelia piped up , " and he looks terrible . I mean , if you even tried a chemical peel , all his skin would , like , peel off . " She made a face . Xander looked exasperated as he turned to her . " Which is the point of a chemical peel , no ? " " Not down to your bones . Not a skull-peel . Eew . " Cordelia folded her arms . " And you should have bought fat-free potato chips . There 's nothing on this table I can eat . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " Joyce said , rising . " Let me see  --  " " Please , Mrs. Summers . Joyce , " Giles said kindly . " We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judging from the frowns the others gave his words . He himself had been so concerned about what was happening that he had not been able to eat much since being released from hospital back in New York . He was also very worried about Micaela Tomasi , the beautiful young Watcher who had flirted with him at the librarians ' convention , then revealed her identity to him while be was in hospital . She 'd brought him a volume of Sherlock Holmes and a huge bouquet of flowers . Now she was missing , and presumed dead . Many Watchers were , these days . If she was dead , it was a terrible pity . And for him , another loss to mourn . Xander , Cordelia , and Giles had just returned days late from their supposed " history competition " in Boston . There would be hell to pay , elaborate explanations to be made , and , possibly , the necessity for the Watcher of the current Slayer to find a new job . An unsettling prospect , to say the least . Sunnydale was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as would suit Giles 's requirements  --  that it be solitary , and easily accessible for Buffy  --  would be difficult to find . " Well , the Doritos are low-fat , " Xander offered . " And the cheese balls are little . " Cordelia shot him a look . " Want to talk about little ? " Xander drew himself up and said , " Hey . " Willow rolled her eyes . Giles hastened to soothe over the moment . " What I believe Xander is trying to explain is that for centuries , the Masters of the Gatehouse , always one of the Regnier line of sorcerers , have been collecting and binding the monsters and demons that escape from breaches into the Otherworld , a sort of other dimension . " " Like the Hellmouth ? " Joyce asked , looking dazed . Giles was pleased . " Very much so . Sunnydale sits upon the Hellmouth , and it both attracts and disgorges various and sundry manifestations of the dark forces of evil . But there are a great many things and people and places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did once exist on earth . All the things which this world does n't have room for in its collective imagination  --  legends and extinct species , abominations and such  --  they all exist in the Otherworld . But from time to time , there is a breach in the barrier between there and here , and they escape . " It is the role of the Gatekeeper to capture these escapees and bind them into rooms in his endless home . " " And it 's such a smashing little madhouse , " Xander drawled in a fake British accent . " Just loaded to the gills with wicked bad juju . " Joyce blinked her deep blue eyes . " Where does he keep them all ? " " It 's astonishing , " Giles answered , warming to the subject . " His house is magickal , you see , and there are thousands of rooms into which he binds all these many diabolical creatures . The house shifts according to the dominant personality within its walls . It 's fascinating . " " More like scary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of cheese balls . " They 're little , " she said to Cordelia . " You 'll balloon , " Cordelia warned her . " A couple nibbles here , a couple there ... " " Where ? " Xander asked sassily , raising and lowering his brows at her . " Stop it , " Cordelia said , sighing at Joyce , as if to say , Can you believe this ? Buffy 's mother nodded slowly . " And something got out of the Gatehouse . " " A whole lot of somethings , " Xander cut in . " See , the heir to the Gatehouse got kidnapped , and if Buffy does n't get him back to the Gatehouse before the old man croaks , well , you can probably say good-bye to Family Fun Evening at the Pitch ' n ' Putt . " " Oh , " Joyce said slowly . Giles pushed his glasses up . He was tired , and to put a word in edgewise was more tiring still . He owed it to Joyce . " I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Buffy , Angel , and Oz may be its last hope . " " How new , " Cordelia said . " How different , " Xander added . Willow sipped her tea . " Seriously , " Giles insisted . " And the Hellmouth has been badly compromised . All sorts of terrible things have emerged from it . They 're held at bay thanks only to Willow 's excellent binding spells  --  " he smiled in Willow 's direction as she sat up straighter and preened a bit  --  " but I 'm not sure how long they 'll last . In short , perhaps it would be best if you got out of Sunnydale for a time . " Joyce looked shocked . Then she said , " We live here . " Giles inclined his head . " Fair enough . But Buffy  --  " And then it happened . There was a low rumbling very like an earthquake , As everyone jumped to their feet and hurried to the doorways in the room  --  thank goodness for California 's community earthquake preparedness training  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake violently . A crack ran diagonally from the upper lefthand side of the window behind the couch all the way across the opposite side . The coffee table bounced up and over , scattering Xander 's junk food everywhere . Joyce fell to the floor , bumping her head . The room went pitch black , and for a moment , she thought she was losing consciousness . Then , as her eyes adjusted the sun shifted behind the curtains , casting au eerie glow over the tense faces in the room . " Look , " Cordelia said , pointing . Something dark formed in the floor , a blackness darker than anything Joyce had ever seen . It collected the wan sunlight , and yet she could still make it out on the carpet . It looked like a puddle of shiny tar . A high , frigid wind whistled through the house , so loud Joyce had to cover h er ears . Books and knick knacks slammed against the wall . " Willow , " Giles called . Buffy 's redheaded friend got to her knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the air , " Hurry , Will , " Xander said . " To the gods I give supplication , and all deference , and honor , " Willow said in a loud , booming voice . The black circle began to rotate so that it now hung vertically in the center of the room . The air around it seemed to shimmer like a pool of water broken by a stone or the movements of life beneath the surface . " Snap it up ! " Cordelia shouted , Willow raised her other arm . " Pan , hear my plea . " " What 's happening ? " Joyce cried . " It 's a breach , " Giles explained . Running might be wise . " Joyce stayed rooted . " You are n't running . And neither are they . " " And therefore , and henceforth , with all the power of the Old Gods , I bind thee ! " Willow shouted . She threw back her hair and raised a fist at the puddle . It contracted like the iris of an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind died down , then stopped . The rumbling ceased . Xander groaned . " Twelve dollars and sixteen cents ' worth of fat-laden tasty treats down the drain . " " That was close , Willow , " Cordelia said sternly . Willow nodded and made a face . " I was caught off guard . " Buffy 's Watcher smoothed back his hair and pushed up his glasses . It was a habit of his that Joyce now found oddly comforting , a reassurance that she had n't just gone completely insane . " That was a breach , " she guessed . " A portal . " Her heart was pounding so hard she was surprised she was n't having a heart attack . " Yes . What we 've been trying to explain . " Giles regarded the area where the circle had appeare d with obvious apprehension . " Willow successfully bound it . " " Well , good , " Joyce said uneasily , avoiding the area as she moved to pick up the mess on the floor . Giles dropped to his knees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood by . At once Willow grabbed an overturned bowl and started gathering up the vast array of cheese balls and potato chips . She sighed softly and handed a broken terra-cotta statuette of a donkey to Joyce , who cradled it gently . Perhaps the girl knew that Buffy had bought this for Joyce on Olvera Street , a touristy Mexican shopping district back in Los Angeles , many years ago . " Well , yes , the thing is , " Giles said , coming up beside her with a double handful of spilled food , " Willow 's done this spell many times all over Sunnydale , and what we 've discovered of late is that the spells may not be permanent . They are overtaxed , shall we say , and there 's no telling if this breach will reopen . Or if so , when . " " Oh . " Joyce gazed uneasily at the spot . " And so , I must restate my suggestion that if you feel you ca n't leave Sunnydale , nevertheless you simply must leave this house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Call forwarding , " Xander said . " We have a guest room . " He looked at the others . " So we tell people they 've got roaches . They 're fumigating . " He smiled at Joyce . " With bunk beds and a desk lamp shaped like a cowboy boot . " " Thanks , but I do n't think so . " Joyce gazed down at the donkey . " I need to be here . This is Buffy 's home . " " Buffy would not want you to be in danger , " Giles said . " Well , I do n't want her to be in danger , either . But she has to be . And she 's my daughter . So I guess I have to be , too . " With that , she burst into tears . She could n't help herself . She was so terribly , terribly frightened for her daughter . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " It 's just that , why does she have to do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Giles said to Buffy 's friends . They stared at each other , then shuffled out of the room . Then Giles did something for which Joyce was unprepared . He took her into his arms and laid her head on his shoulder . " Joyce , I know it 's difficult , " he said , and suddenly , they were very alike , she and this man who had shouldered the burden of knowing that Buffy was a Vampire Slayer , and had kept that secret from Joyce for two years . She sometimes hated him for it even though she understood the reason : her ignorance had allowed Buffy to do what she had to without moments like these . " When I was her age , I thought I might like to be an archaeologist , " she said , her voice muffled against his shoulder . " Really ? I was , for a time , " he said . " But I had something else to do . Something more important . " " You were called to be Buffy 's Watcher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And I 'm her mother . I guess what we want does n't really matter . We have to help her . " She took a deep breath . " Help her survive . " " Yes . " He looked at her steadily . " I wish it were n't so , but it 's true . " Tears spilled down her cheeks . " When you have a baby , you have so many hopes and dreams . You never want them to be sad or hurt . Just wrap them in cotton wool and keep them safe forever . I ca n't help but feel that I 've failed her in some way . " " You have n't . She loves you so much . " He smiled gently . " She 's always going on about your chocolate chip cookies . I must say , they are quite delicious . " " I 'll make some tomorrow , " she said . " I 'll have them ready in case she comes home . " Then she managed a smile . " And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Xander said from the doorway . Joyce laughed . This boy in his baggy shirts corduroy pants was such a mixture of man and puppy dog . Then there was Cordelia , always so over-dressed in her high-fashion clothes  --  today 's black and gray chiffon dress was no exception  --  and sweet Willow , her overalls and sweaters . They were all a combination of seasoned adults who had faced terrors she could scarcely imagine and wide-eyed children learning to deal with the world outside their families and homes . " Quadruple batch , " Joyce said . Willow smiled sweetly at her and came to her side as Xander said , " If it helps , Mrs. Summers , we 're all pulling for her . We 'll do anything for Buffy . We 'd die for her . " " Hey , " Cordelia said , then shrugged . " Well , maybe I would consider getting seriously hurt . " Somehow , amid all the stress and fear , that got them all laughing . In the little house in Sunnydale . Situated on the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
