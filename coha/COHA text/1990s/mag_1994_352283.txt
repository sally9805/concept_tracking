The time has come for a little historical perspective . Labor unrest has been as American as apple pie , hot dogs and home runs since 1636 . In that benighted year , well before any of the aforementioned institutions  --  including the very nation itself  --  had been invented , the gentlemen who owned the fishing boats on Richmond Island , off the coast of Maine , imposed the first known salary cap . In their wisdom , they withheld all the wages of their crews for an entire year , a hardball move if ever there was one . Not surprisingly , the fishermen went on strike . Since then there have been tens of thousands of strikes that have helped shape labor law and define the compact between worker and boss . Many strikes have been bitter . Some have been brutal : 18 steelworkers were killed during a 3 1/2-month strike in 1919-20 . <P> But no strike in the past 358 years , not one , can claim to be as ludicrous as the current work stoppages bedeviling professional sports .

It 's the rich vs. the megarich in a spectacle almost as distasteful to watch as the intramurals among the wackos of the House of Windsor . If there are principles involved , and both sides swear there are , they do not make sense to anyone but the principals . To the rest of the nation , the baseball strike and hockey lockout share one characteristic : they both seem downright stupid . <P> Last week there was no World Series . Instead , President Clinton convened the first meeting between the feuding owners and players since the season was called off in September . Not surprisingly , no one broke into a spontaneous rendition of Take Me Out to the Ball Game . Players Association officials reiterated the union 's unshakable stance in support of free agency . Owners repeated their immutable demands for a salary cap . Players Association executive director Don Fehr and interim baseball commissioner Bud Selig competed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newly appointed mediator Bill Usery Jr . made it clear that he understands intransigence when he sees it . " When you believe you have positions that are very strong , it 's difficult , " he said . Settle in for a long winter , fans . <P> - This week the National Hockey League , fresh from a triumphant 1993-94 season and the proud owner of a new five-year , $155 million network-television contract with Fox , still finds itself in the penalty box . The regular season did not commence as scheduled ; the first puck may not drop for weeks . Or months . League officials were not idle , however . They were reportedly busy hiring two bodyguards to protect N.H.L. commissioner Gary Bettman , perhaps from churlish players who in the past have proved adept at rearranging facial characteristics with sticks . Sweet reason seemed in short supply . " The owners are ready for a battle , " says Boston Bruins president Harry Sinden . " There 's more solidarity this time around . "          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
