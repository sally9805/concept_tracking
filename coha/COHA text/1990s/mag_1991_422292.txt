Section : BUSINESS A step-by-step guide , beginning with the most important one : start now <p> Paying for college is the Matterhorn of personal finance . No one who has stood in those chill winds ever forgets them . When the College Board announces this week the results of its cost survey for the 1992-93 school year , middle-income parents will be especially shocked . Although a number of pricey private schools have moderated their increases , many state colleges and universities are pushing tuitions sharply up . " In four or five years , tuition in many state schools could double , " says Elaine ElKhawas , vice president for policy analysis and research at the American Council on Education . <p> And do n't expect any extra help from student aid . Over the past decade , as the real value of federal aid went steadily down , state and private programs filled the gap . Now they 're also running out of steam . In the past year , 35 states have chopped their higher-education budgets . <p> Baby boomers , in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their parents did . As a group , boomers tended to have children later in life . So they 'll go mano a mano with the college bursar when they 're 55 or 60 and retirement is upon them . <p> Strategic saving : What you need is a way of saving , for your kids ' education and your own retirement at the same time . Tough but not impossible , says Richard Anderson , vice chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis , who offers this strategy : Buy a house and keep it . Do n't trade up or take out any home-equity loans . Save your borrowing power for college costs . Start a tax-deferred retirement plan like a Keogh or company 401(k) plan and fund it to the maximum . These plans take priority , for two reasons : ( 1 ) Your contributions are pretax. ( 2 ) With many plans , your employer will match the money you put in . Chuck any extra money into a college savings account . Tell your children they 'll have to work and save for college , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding to your retirement plan . Do n't borrow against it , either ; save all those funds for your own future . The money you otherwise would have contributed to the plan each year should now go for tuition . Add any college savings you have . Fill the gap with a loan against your home equity whose interest costs are tax-deductible ( you get no deduction on education loans ) . Washington University , for one , makes low-rate home-equity loans to parents who want to prepay four years of college at today 's price . When your children are through college , use current income to repay the loans . <p> Obviously , this strategy could go wrong . Your house might not gain enough in value . You might be forced into early retirement . If these things happen , your children will have to downsize their education plans . You can not impoverish yourself in old age to finance an expensive school . Parents who ca n't , or wo n't , save for college are saying to their kids , " Pay it yourself " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savings plan , where should the money go ? Almost universally , financial planners advise that-for young children-you should buy mutual funds that invest in stocks . Straight interest-paying investments such as bonds and certificates of deposit are pretty much no-growth , after taxes and inflation . Only stocks have a chance of exceeding the high rate of increase in college costs . <p> Do n't worry if the market drops . It will eventually spring back . As college draws closer , however , stocks get too risky . At that point , you should gradually move your money into places that preserve capital . <p> Here 's a sample investment cycle for you to follow : From your child 's birth until age 12 , buy shares in stock-owning mutual funds . From 12 to 14 , hold on to all past investments in mutual funds but start putting new money into safer havens , such as Series EE Savings Bonds , Treasury securities and certificates of deposit . Or you might consider a balanced fund such as Vanguard 's Wellesley or Wellington Funds ( in Valley Forge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds . When your child reaches 14 , move the freshman-year money out of stocks and into a guaranteed four-year investment like a CD . At 15 , move out the sophomore-year money , and so on . <p> To make college saving as painless as possible , automate it . Arrange for money to be taken from your bank account each month and invested in a mutual fund . <p> When you use bank drafts , some funds even waive the minimum investment  --  typically $1,000 to $3,000-which they normally require to open an account . For example , all the Janus funds in Denver let you start with drafts as small as $50 a month . The T. Rowe Price funds in Baltimore will accept $100 a month . The Gabelli Asset fund in New York City completely eliminates its huge $25,000 minimum in return for automatic monthly payments of $100 or more . Many other . funds that do n't advertise it do the same . The Twentieth Century funds in Kansas City , Mo. , which have no minimums , accept drafts as low as $25 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts under $1,000 . <p> If you want to invest a lump sum of money , Janet Briaud , a financial planner in Bryan , Texas , suggests a portfolio of funds : a small-company growth fund , a big-company fund , a " value " fund ( whose manager seeks out promising stocks selling at low prices ) and maybe an international fund . But buy these funds gradually , making monthly investments over two years , advises William Brennan of the accounting firm Ernst &; Young . That 's called dollar-cost averaging and usually nets you a lower average price than if you bought your shares all at once . <p> Are you terrified of the stock market ? Try putting just half of your money into stock-owning mutual funds and storing the rest in various safe holes . But over time , I 'll wager that your stock funds will win . Here are some bum college investments : <p> ( 1 ) Passbook accounts , short-term CDs and money-market mutual funds . Their after-tax return is too low . Money funds , for example , now average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature later than the money is needed . For example , take a 30-year bond . If it 's sold after just 15 years , you risk losing capital . Bond-maturity dates should always match the dates when tuition will be due . <p> ( 3 ) Short-term bond funds . Their yield wo n't keep up with the rise in college inflation ( which is higher than the general inflation rate ) . You might try these funds in the couple of years before matriculation , but you risk losing capital if interest rates rise . A safer choice is a two-year CD . <p> ( 4 ) Rental real estate . You ca n't count on a high return after costs , nor can you count on selling quickly when tuition falls due . <p> ( 5 ) Life-insurance cash values . Because of sales commissions and other costs , savings in- cash-value policies do n't grow fast enough to be interesting . Furthermore , their current interest rates are more likely to go down than up . As for a life-insurance policy on your child , forget it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay you if your child dies . <p> ( 6 ) Any long-term CD or bond . Relative to the rise in college costs , these investments usually do n't grow . They appeal to savers because they are allegedly " safe . " At maturity , you get your money back . But bonds are never safe from inflation . In fact , they 'll probably lose college purchasing power after tax . These low performers include zero-coupon bonds ( you buy zeros at a fraction of their face value and watch their worth increase every year ) ; " baccalaureate " bonds ( tax-free zeros sold by many states ) ; even Series EE savings bonds . <p> Series EE bonds are superficially attractive . You pay no taxes on the income if you meet certain requirements , such as holding the bonds in your name rather than in your child 's , using them for college tuition and falling within a middle-income range . But the rate of interest currently 6.57 percent-wo n't keep up with college costs . <p> There 's one place for bonds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small risk that stocks will do poorly over 10 or 15 years . For hedging purposes , zero-coupon bonds generally yield more than Series EEs . Small investors might try zero-coupon bond mutual funds , available from Benham Target in Mountain View , Calif. , and the Scudder group in Boston . The only advantage to EE bonds : their interest rate changes every six months , so they offer modest inflation protection . <p> Strategic borrowing : Assuming that income and savings wo n't hand you the keys to Princeton or even Michigan State , you 'll probably have to borrow money . The best loans : ( 1 ) home-equity loans ; ( 2 ) government-financed Perkins or Stafford loans , available to students with low or middle incomes . Current interest rate on Perkins loans : 5 percent . On Staffords : 8 percent for the first four years of repayment , 10 percent thereafter . Payments are deferred until the child gets out of school . ( 3 ) Government-authorized PLUS/SLS loans . Current interest rate : 9.34 percent with a 12 percent cap , Student borrowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deferring repayment until they leave school . Ask about these loans at banks , S &Ls; and college financial-aid offices . <p> If you still come up short , or do n't have home equity , try commercial loans . Some require no collateral and also let you defer payments . Among the most cost-effective lenders today , according to Steven Sesit of American University in Washington , D.C. , who analyzes college loans : The Education Resources Institute in Boston . Creditworthy borrowers can get up to $20,000 a year , at variable rates now at prime plus 1.5 to 2 percentage points . A good loan without a deferred-payment option : the Extended Repayment Plan offered by Knight Tuition Payment Plans in Boston . <p> Some parents claim that you 're a sucker to save . The greater your assets , the less you 'll get in college aid . But the size of your student-aid package depends mostly on your family income . Spendthrift families with low savings might pick up an extra $1,000 in loans or grants . But they 'll still owe a huge sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover it . Trust me , savers win the day . If You 're Starting Now <p> If you have no college savings , here 's a rough guide to how much you should start putting away each month . This table assumes ( 1 ) the average cost of college ; ( 2 ) a 7 percent annual increase in college costs ; ( 3 ) an 8 percent return on your money .

WILSON  --  NEWSWEEK <p> GRAPH:Future Shock <p> Here 's the likely cost of four years at the average school , assuming annual increases of 7 percent . Many schools charge much less .
