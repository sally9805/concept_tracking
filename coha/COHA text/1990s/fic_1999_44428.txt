This story is for my brother <p> My sister 's face encouraged strangers to approach her . They faked polite , their hands just grazing her shoulder blades ' bony wings . " A snapshot for us , sugar ? " At Folly Beach , rednecks in ribbed tank shirts piled on each other for a pose and grinned to hide the menace in their eyes . She blinked , they bellied up . " Here , press . " Adeena 's hair wild in the wind , she steadied the camera with one hand and with the other hand covered her eye that was not behind the lens because she could n't focus with both eyes open and could n't close one eye without blinking the other shut , too . Con artists liked watching her watch them through the shutter . It was n't her long legs and skimpy bathing suit that marked her . Not her stuttering m 's that turned " maybes " into a sound like yes . Adeena 's pull was seashell ears , rise-and-fall eyebrows , and a silvery forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to read . <p> You 'd think that now she 's sixteen , lost her stammer , owns a driver 's license , wears eyeshadow up to her pierced brow , and most days smells like one big clove cigarette , this shit would stop . But at the state fair grounds ten minutes from our house in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , a man our father 's age slurred into her neck . <p> " You 're from Fuquay Varina , are n't you ? I know because I 've seen you . Mighty long drive from Fuquay for this dog and pony show . " He shrugged his shoulders , waiting behind Adeena in line for the Wall of Death , the ride that spins and spins until the floor drops out and you 're standing in midair , body fast to the wall , hands heavy as a corpse , Adeena 's favorite . <p> She did n't respond , so he patted her back . She turned . " You with anybody ? " he asked . His diamond pinkie ring and slick head glared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only I did n't shade my eyes from him . I watched head-on until they both ducked into the dark mouth of that whirling tin can of a midway attraction . I was holding her wallet . I do n't like crowds . I am a protective brother , as you can tell , but only to a point . With the bald guy , we had n't reached it . Not even close . <p> Across from the Wall of Death was a deserted booth and I parked myself on the counter , the perfect spot for Adeena-surveillance . It was late afternoon and fathers divvied out tickets for the Tilt-o-Whirl , then lonesomed it through the bustle of things , eating funnel cake and soggy barbecue sandwiches , their feet cracking the fairgrounds straw . The air smelled of popcorn butter and manure . Pretty women barely older than I stooped over bawling rugrats to wipe their faces hard , erasing them like clues to their own crimes . <p> One of my father 's old friends , Chick Bolch , washed up with the crowd . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " It 's a carnival , Chick . Not a circus . " We shook hands at the ends of our fingers and released with a dull snap . Chick was like kin . He worked the wine selection at Fowler 's Grocery in town and was a notorious insomniac who wore painted-on eyebrows and a white , square-collared Cuban shirt . <p> " Carnival . Circus . What 's the difference ? " Chick fished a round box of Skoal from his back pocket and unscrewed the lid . Without looking at it , he took a pinch and packed his bottom lip . <p> " Elephants , " I said . " Tigers . " <p> " None of those pretty women swinging across the big top in feathery costumes and no net ? " <p> " Nope . " <p> " I was misinformed . " Chick grinned , his lip pooched with snuff . " That 's what I showed up for . The flying feathered ladies . " <p> The thin black paint of his brows dripped sweat as his eyes settled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Across the fairgrounds , the Wall of Death exit was empty even though the ride should have ended by now . Where was she ? <p> " Is n't that one of your ducks out of row ? " Chick asked . I slid off the counter to follow his gaze . <p> Even twenty yards away in her drooping black T-shirt , raccoon eyes , and cut-offs that skimmed her ass , Adeena looked like temptation to a kidnapping . <p> " Over here , " she yelled . Arms outstretched , she balanced on her toes and pirouetted a few crazy circles . She called my name , breathless , as if we were still kids and in her hand was a secret meant only for me . " Jason Curtis ! " she yelled . " Come catch me before I fall ! " <p> The bald slob tottered right beside her and , in pathetic imitation of Adeena , twirled an uneven circle himself . They looked like a couple of sloppy-faced hippies at Woodstock , an event I have never understood : grown people romping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grow up . The clumsy spins of Adeena 's new friend , local perv , made me cringe . It was one thing for Adeena to flap arms and howl , and it was another thing for this joker to play drunken sailor . Anyone with eyeteeth could see what he was up to , but he did n't see me closing in . I cut across the fairgrounds , my boots kicking straw , itching for a little goto . <p> " So , I 'll see you back in Fu-quaaay Varina ? " the man asked . Adeena was still spinning , her face uplifted to the carnival lights . He grasped at one of her hands , pretending he needed her for balance , pretending he needed her hold to stop him from tumbling . For a moment , they were almost kind of nearly holding hands . <p> Skin on skin . This was my cue . You can pity the bald fuck . Not me . <p> " So I 'll see you next Friday , okay ? " he asked . <p> At the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fish  --  lipped mouth that I wiped off with one sharp smack at his hand . " No you wo n't , " I said . " She does n't live in Fuquay Varina . She never has lived there . And the real point is , she 's with me . " <p> Then he really did look as if he needed a hand to hold . He stared at me with a strange expression , as if I 'd caught him , pants unzipped , hand inside . He righted himself and went completely still , his tubular arms covered in swirls of Irish red hair stiff at his sides . <p> " That 's big talk coming from a small mouth , " he said . He wiped his head , smoothing back imaginary hair . My hand stung . He squinted and pointed an index finger at me but looked toward Adeena . " Who 's this ? " he asked . " Bobby boyfriend ? " <p> Adeena frowned and grabbed my arm , trying to drag me back to The Wall of Death . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then under her breath , " you numbnuts . " <p> " Well , take care , sweetheart , " he said to Adeena . <p> " Nope . You take care . I take risks . " She laughed brightly , rough fingers in mine . <p> " What the hell was all that ? " I asked . She shrugged . <p> Did she still not know that the joker 's age alone meant he was at least some kind of asshole ? How could she still not know that she stopped wherever another body , slick with sweat and pint-bottled cologne , started ? I pressed on , taking long strides that jerked Adeena along . The crowd pulsed with blond cheerleaders clutching green stuffed-animal frogs to their chests , and fat boys , mouths suctioned to cotton candy . Adeena dropped my hand then and stopped . The whoop  --  whoop- sound of the ring-toss went off , and suddenly the entire maze of rides and junk food stalls and tented exhibits was too much for me . All those people sucking the oxygen from the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take her elbow and steer us through the entrance , but the twitch of her fingers against her thighs meant she was under one of her spells , stuck . Much as Adeena tried to keep it hidden , I knew when she was counting out series of numbers just to be able to pick up a forkful of salad or switch out lights in a room . Ever since junior high , she traced stars on her thigh until the number of sides corresponded to some magic sum in her head , counted all the door locks thirty-five times before she 'd get into my Chevy Blazer . She scoured soda pop cans before cracking them , got on all fours to inspect the heat registers with an untranslatable dread creasing the papery skin beneath her eyes . Fear binds , and Deens and me , we were thick as thieves . <p> " ' O lost and by the wind-grieved ghost . " ' It was Chick back beside us again , familiar rasp dragging the bottom of his words . " Or should I just say Adeena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what you should do . " Adeena said . " I 'm not sleepwalking . If you ca n't , I 'll recite the verse 's tail . " Adeena paused , looked skyward . <p> Chick did n't say anything . He put his hand in the scooped part of her back and the three of us walked . <p> " Come back again , " ' Adeena breathed . <p> When he died eight months ago our father said good-bye to Deens last . Blueprints and sheafs of single-spaced manuscript pages stuffed his closet , but his single source of income had been as a salesman at a hiking gear store . He accepted merchandise in place of salary , so we still had a pair of three-hundred-dollar spiked boots , depreciating with dust in the garage , that I considered pawning . The only thing he finished was his life , and even that Houdini moment was not his trick . We were the ones who pulled the plug Christmas morning . As a present . We said it was cancer we released him from , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his bones-and-vein body just by standing there . Our mother , Mame , gripping the claw of his hand , Adeena and I crowding the top of his machine with Styrofoam cups of cherry cola , we whispered as if regular talk could have raised him . <p> Actually , I had lied to carnival-perv . Adeena had lived in Fuquay Varina . For an entire year . But that poor man 's Telly Savalas could not have known her then and recognized her now . It was too many years ago that my father left Chapel Hill for Fuquay , Adeena beside him in the low-slung , gold Karmann Ghia . Mame talked divorce , abandonment , and , after whiskey , abduction . But could he really steal something already belonging to him ? In the family coin toss how had Dad won Adeena ? Clues from that year surfaced in our house : a red glass-bead bracelet , blank postcard of the Statue of Liberty-a night scene with fake , sunset-colored lights in the torch-credit card receipts from a Howard Johnson 's in Niagara Falls . Adeena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one recorded Fuquay . It had a denim wrapper with a blue-jeans pocket on the cover , but even she was too sharp to store the key there . I checked . <p> After the carnival , Adeena and I returned home to tend to the pigeons . The birds were like monks , brooding and autumn-colored , Seven Dwarves to Adeena 's Snow White . Their roosts were a set of old bookshelves rigged in a tall wire cage attached to the shed . During my father 's sickness , Chick built the coop for Deens . He helped her rescue foundlings from dive-bombing hawks . <p> Dirty feathers clouded their water bowls , and the nitrate smell of crap made me woozy . I held my breath as I dumped the dishes outside and wiped the rims on the grass . Adeena readied an injection for Frankie , sick with parasites . I had an opening shift at the restaurant later , and she was still pissy . She wanted to see a band playing that night at Cat 's Cradle , but Mame had discovered her plans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club 's flyer in Adeena 's face and reminded her she was too young . " Minors are not allowed , Miss Knees . " She swatted the ad at the twin moons of Adeena 's kneecaps , but it was already limp as old Monopoly money . The group was the White Zombies . <p> Adeena held Frankie tightly , shrinking him to nearly half his size to keep him still . His brown and silver wings shuddered in her hands . I quickly changed the paper in his shelf where he roosted over two stones , fake eggs . Mame had placed them there to comfort him , but now he imagined himself a nesting female . If we tried to take his stones away to clean his roost , he 'd freak , flapping his weak wings and screeching . <p> The needle was less than an inch long and very slender . Frankie held still , and Adeena cooed for him , a nonsense language and sound she saved for only the birds . Ooo-la-la , vous say ma lair du tete , me tango . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silvery silver . At night , in that streak of time between sleep and dream , that low voice of hers came to me and those weird words that were like a code I would never be smart enough to crack . Even in the day , dried leaves at my feet could look like pigeon feathers about to wing into the air and fly away . <p> " Sadistic , not lonely , " Adeena said , palming Frankie 's slight head . " What ? " It was hard giving the birds shots . Adeena was good at it . I was n't . <p> " Your personal set of instructions . Mine 's horses , not reindeer . ' If I see hoof prints I 'm supposed to think logical , predictable . Horses have galloped here , not reindeer . Think obvious , not fairy tale . <p> " And if you see someone a little unfocused and sad inside , " said Adeena , " you 're trained to think sadistic creepface ' and not , say , forlorn beer-guzzler . " ' <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And you know that , Deens . " <p> " That news ad was in my Levis pocket . " <p> I turned to look at her when she spoke and witnessed the moment of injection . With a quick jab she slipped the needle into Frankie 's quivering breast . The other birds jerked at the spilling seeds , and their blunted beaks stabbed the ' meat of my thumb . <p> " Christ . " It pricked me , too , that scratch of the needle piercing stiff feathers and sliding roughly into Frankie 's puffed chest : not bone , not flesh , like papier-mache . <p> " She must be pickpocketing again , " she said . " Dust for fingerprints . My stuff 's covered with Mame 's . " <p> " You just need to talk to her more . " On the cinder block beside the door I scraped straw and bird crap from my boot soles . " Tell her secrets . Lie if you have to . " <p> " I just need money , " said Adeena . " Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She held Frankie close to her face , murmuring to him as her lips brushed his beak . His flat black eye , a perfect circle , shuttered and opened again as if he could n't believe what a bird 's life was turning out to be . " Nobody keeps a person with money out of the show . " <p> " I give you money , do n't I ? " <p> Adeena gently returned Frankie to his stone eggs and his bed made of straw . " Yes , you do , pretty bird , Jay . Do you know I got that pair of twenties you stuck in my wallet at the fair ? " she asked and lightly kissed my ear . She smelled dense with seed and musk , and I caught my hand in her hair and rubbed strands of it between my thumb and fingers . " It 's not enough . " She stepped back . " And it 's not the same thing . " <p> Adeena stood still , fingers tapping the bottom ledge of the coop , a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just enough so she could pass . In the narrowing slant of sunlight , she tilted her face toward the sky , like a greeting . <p> " Then what is ? " <p> She did n't hear . In shade , hand a white knot on the rusted handle , Mame held open the back porch screen . She was eager for Adeena to come to her , come closer , come home to roost . <p> No matter how light it was outside , the dining room of the Bayou Bijoux was always dim and smoky . The first hour , when cooks and waits were all prepping and cleaning , it smelled putrid , as if hidden in the walls was a store of perishable goods doing just that , perishing . Atop the roof outside sat a giant plastic pig called Rohmer . It was about the size of a Kharmann Ghia , and at dark I flipped on the set of white bulbs glowing inside its broad butt . I picked mint growing at the edge of the building , the air outside still warm with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dirt streaking Rohmer 's joints gave him a sinister look , a hog of vengeance Adeena loved . At Christmastime , pine looped around its neck and an apple crammed in his corn-kernel teeth , she loved the way Rohmer 's sinister air segued to vulnerable . For a time , I schemed to steal it for her , hide it in the stand of pines at the Haw ( Adeena called it the Hee-Haw river ) . Hike there and at the last minute , tell her to close her eyes , say , " Trust me . " Hold her hand and lead her into the clearing . Watch her eyelids tremble . When she 's almost close enough to touch its snout , tell her , " It 's okay . Open them . " <p> On break , I watched the floor through the kitchen porthole windows . The waitresses wore black , thick-heeled shoes and skirts that swished high on their thighs when they bent over to fill water glasses . Aging women caressed martini glass stems . Big brooches tugged their shirts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting long legs , they flirted with their frat-boy sons . Painted nails all over their sons ' forearms , shoulders , neckties . Like , no question , they 'd swap their husbands for their sons any day . <p> What did these richies mean to me ? My percentage of the pool tip money , that simple . For Adeena . She wanted a video camera to film the birds when she released them into the wild . I planned to get it for her and needed a hundred bucks more . Arnaud , the owner of the Bayou Bijoux , strutted into the kitchen . " Is it all good ? " he asked the kitchen at large . An ex-Cajun drug bandit , Arnaud had big Bill Clinton hands , always twitching , and something about the slippery bastard 's steak-red face made me consider larceny , grand or impulse-item . <p> " We 're flush , " I said . <p> After break , I was on crudite duty and Blue , an off-shift line chef , was practicing flipping cigarettes from the backs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his best trick . Arnaud snorted his phony  --  bologna laugh and forked over a five . " Pitiful , " Arnaud said and returned to the lobby , Blue on his tail . <p> I started back on vegetables . Some busboys were discussing reincarnation and the limited number of souls in the universe . John Clay thwacked down a slab of prime rib and said supply was not keeping up with demand . My favorite waitress raced into the kitchen and filched a cleaned carrot from beneath my arm . Widening her eyes at me she snapped the stick between her teeth . " Back to the ghouls , " she said and turned on her heel . <p> Blue peeked into the swing doors , tucking licorice strands of hair behind his ears . <p> " Hey , Jethro . Ellie May 's arrived . Wanting to go to the Cradle with me tonight . White Zombies . " <p> Through the swinging doors I glimpsed Adeena sitting at the bar . What was she doing there , nose pointed up as if she belonged ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her last birthday , that was my gift . Its winding silver legs clashed with her bad girl T-shirt and black-circled eyes , her **32;1166;TOOLONG look , that wild , **61;1200;TOOLONG look . <p> " I told her I 'd give you my spot at Arnaud 's private party tomorrow night if you 'd lie to your mom , " Blue said . <p> I wiped my blade on my cook 's jacket . The knife angled low at my hips , I pointed it at Blue and turned the edge . It flashed . " So what the hell you going to do with her ? " <p> " Do ? What do you mean do ? " Blue stepped back , his hands in a stick-'em-up pose . " Easy , Jethro . We 'll dance , drink hooch . What the hell else ? " <p> " Blue , Adeena 's edgy but she 's not even eighteen . " <p> He made a flapping mouth motion in the air with one hand . " Money to work the party . You know you want it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the soft of his middle . His gray T-shirt was old and thin , probably his favorite . I thought of the tattoo on his chest , " Rock Hard , " as around us noise and motion fell off . <p> Blue leaned into the knife , his eyes bruised and hooded . " What is it ? She your sister or your squeeze ? " <p> My face heated . " Ca n't a guy protect his baby sister without a flatliner like you making it dirty ? " The handle was slippery in my hand , and I pulled the knife away . <p> " I 'll have her home by one . And you 'll score change tomorrow . " Blue smirked . " I 'll work my sorcery for you . " <p> Before the doors swung shut behind him , I spied Adeena . At the bar , she shrank her shoulders inside her baggy sleeves and rippled her arms out as if she were trying to defy the bend of elbow . I imagined taping her with a video camera and stepping toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The story of your life . Talk to the man behind the camcorder . Give him how it was . Be truthful now , the whole unvarnished all of it . <p> I sucked the blood oozing from a nick on my thumb and scooped the ruined greens from the cutting board . There was a sharp rap on the kitchen porthole . Adeena had pressed her nose to one of the porthole windows and pulled her chin down to make a pig 's snout . Leaving , she flashed the peace sign and gave me her don't-hate-me look . <p> Not long afterward , I did it . I snatched a case of Absolut from the storeroom , carrying it out in one of our rolling green plastic trash barrels covered with a scatter of ripped potato sacks as camouflage . Outside the back gate , I stashed it behind the dumpster , then dumped the actual trash and hustled back inside . Arnaud was at the time-card slots . " Later , " I said . He did n't even look . After punching out , I drove my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alley , where I stopped beside the dumpster , hopped out , stowed the case in the bed , and split . <p> Over the railroad tracks and out the narrow planks called Chicken Bridge , in the right mix of evening light or the high beams of passing cars , you can see blood spattered on the gray metal suspension struts from a motorcycle accident years ago . That night I crossed the Chicken Bridge and saw no blood , which was good . I had enough of my own pushing fast , faster . I was selling the case of Absolut to Chick Bolch . When I arrived , he was chewing the stub of a cartoon-sized cigar and drinking Polish vodka from a Ball canning jar . He was sitting in a cheap folding chair in the middle of his yard and behind him fireflies popped in the honeysuckle bushes . He did n't seem surprised to see me . " That 's a case of Absolut , " I told him . " Twenty-four fifths . " I placed the box at his feet . <p> Chick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the garage . He disappeared into the dark mouth of it but then did n't snap the bare bulb chain dangling over his workbench . He clanged around so long I thought he was n't so much fetching money as resurrecting it from the dead . <p> " You notice how high the river is ? " he asked when at last he emerged . <p> " Too dark out . " <p> " Your sister sure looks pert these days . You know , healed over and growing up . " Chick looked at me . " See any blood on Chicken Bridge ? " I shook my head . <p> He laughed . " Too dark for that , too , I suppose . " He slipped six twenties in my hand and looked past me to the firefly-dark . " Keep thinking that bridge will wash out soon . " <p> All the way home , that meaningless fear kept repeating in my head like a song you hate but ca n't stop playing in your mind . The bridge will soon wash out . In my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't sleep . About three in the morning , Maine cracked the door open . " Where 's your sister ? " She pulled her pink robe tight . " She got out and I did n't even see . " <p> " She 's asleep , Mame . " I sat up and pulled the drape next to my bed . The moon shone on Adeena 's face at my feet . <p> " Ahhmm , " Mame said . <p> When I let her in the back door about one , Adeena had smelled sweet with beer and dope . The bored , petulant look on her face was a good sign . She whispered that Blue was " over-rated " and the lead singer of the White Zombies was " jr . high short . " <p> " He kept shaking hands with his band members after their solos , " she said and rested her head on my shoulder . I smelled her shampoo through smoke trapped in her hair . " I hate that , " she said . For souvenirs , Blue had taken a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , we made a tent of the sheet with our bent knees , our shoulders pressed together . She flickered them like one of those comic books that you flip through fast and see a figure move in the upper right corner of the pages , Pop-Eye knocking a guy flat . Adeena tilting back a dark bottle . Adeena at a bar of blurred faces . Adeena sticking out her tongue . The direct look she gave the camera made me feel as if I had snapped the fan of pictures and not Blue . <p> Hair draped across the foot of my bed , Adeena had fallen asleep with the snapshots in her fist . <p> In the dim light of the room , Maine eased into the rolling chair at my desk , crossing her leg at the knee and tucking her foot behind her ankle . " I 've been thinking about that pigeon coop . " She spoke quietly . " If we tore out the roosts and sold off the hay , we could turn the shed into a studio . Think she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip . <p> " I would if I were her , " Mame added . Then she left , her small hands worrying the tie of her gown and her footfall soft as rain . <p> All my family knows of love is its urgency . <p> On my way to Arnaud 's party , I stopped at Best Buy and bought the video camera . A Sony . A small screen swung from the side of it and its microphone was extremely sensitive . Now that I had the camera I was figuring on other purchases Adeena would crave : high-speed film , lighting features , tripod . The cars lining Arnaud 's drive were all black with silver hood medallions , and their rooftops reflected the rushing sky like water . I had the camera and an extra gig . It gave me a good , **25;1263;TOOLONG feeling . I loaded it with film and took the camera inside . <p> Inside Arnaud 's white , ultra-mod kitchen the lights were glaring , and three girls filled trays with melon balls wrapped in papery ham . Sisters to John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . On the smallest one 's face a scar ran from just beneath her eye to the round of her cheek , a permanent tear trail . When she scratched between her legs , one of her sisters swatted her hand away . John Clay stacked wine crates , and grub worms of sweat inched down his face . <p> I scraped batches of cocktail forks by hand . It was shitty work . When I finally had a break , I was sweating too . I rolled the sleeves of my T-shirt and spit-rubbed as many stains from my black jeans as I could . John Clay was going to drive his sisters home . I was free . <p> As the three of them filed out , I followed their movements in the video screen , the camera trained on their backs . <p> " Say good-bye , " I said to the little one . " Just once . Say something to the camera , sugar . " The girls had n't talked to me all evening . I did n't really expect an answer . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute I thought she was going to snatch the camera from my hands . Instead she wrapped them around my thighs , craned her head at me , and blinked . When I bent down , she kissed my cheek , loosening her grip on my legs and putting her finger to her lips . <p> " Sugar . " she said . <p> The strange moment as she fluttered toward me , all legs and lolling ponytails , that kiss sharp on her mind , stuck to me . I imagined it over and over as I headed out back to the barbecue pit . Following the sound of the stream whooshing at the base of Arnaud 's property , I thought of Adeena home injecting Harlan now , sick with Frankie 's parasites . She would like the footage of John Clay 's sister giving sugar to a stranger . She would appreciate its raw documentary surprise . <p> A ring of torches flickered in the black lawn . Watery air slowed the flames , and people were speaking softly , no music . The effect was out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks alive and not from this earth . The thick line of fire created a horizon that divided the deep yard into upper and lower halves . From this murk appeared a cluster of people sitting just below the split between light and dark . They were so close I could almost touch them , and with backs to me , they did n't see me . At the center of them was a futon lawn chair and beside it , a silver stand that looked like a hotel ashtray balancing two sweating high ball glasses . In the chaise lay the thick folds of a fat man . His gut nearly blocked his face and his arms were covered in thick caftans . He moved impossibly , as if he were the thing the alien ship let loose , arms and legs and shoulders at impractical angles to each other . I moved closer and detected my mistake . It was not one large man prone on the couch but two people nested together . One of them was Chick , his face so puffed and wheezy looking it almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Adeena and whispered , neither of them aware of me and the flimsy shadow I cast out of the flames . They fit together perfectly , a sculpture in a museum you 'd want to touch illicitly . <p> " In Fuquay Varina , " Adeena said , pausing to count the stars exploding in her head or the number of times she could think the word danger and not really believe its meaning . " My father used to take me out . " She patted Chick 's knee . " We 'd sit at a table in the ice cream parlor where the sun fell the hottest and I would n't touch my mocha chip until I could sip it like milk . " <p> He pulled her closer but was not looking at her , maybe not even listening . I tightened my sweaty grip on the video handle . I had never noticed how slight Chick 's legs were , how breakable . <p> " That was the best . I mean , the everything best . We pretended we were rich because my father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green . Is that true ? " <p> " Your brother will kill you and me both if he sees you here . " It was Blue . He came up from behind the chair offering her a paper plate bent with pork barbecue and shrimp . He did n't see me in the shadow of a pine as he stooped over her . <p> " You 're jealous , " said Adeena . She turned Chick 's face to her . She kissed him full on the mouth . Suddenly she was more the man who held her than he was . <p> I edged closer , the video camera in my hand , not focused , not even turned on . The gift . There was no room on the lounger for me . I laid the camcorder on the grass at my feet and went back to the shadowed side of the house . I pushed myself into it until the brick stung the skin of my elbows , my hands , so secretless and dull . She kissed him again thinking this time no one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised them to his mouth , said , " Now , now . " Stretching her leg to scratch the sole of his foot with her toes , she giggled . I stood for the longest time shivering . <p> Near the hospital once , a woman in a fur-collared coat had run against traffic to where we huddled in the cold , waiting for the cross light . The crowd watched as she pressed into Adeena ' s mittened hands a pink plastic purse . Wet-eyed and in a thick whisper , she said , " Here , honey , you want this shiny thing more than I need it . " Maine and I surged forward , arms raised , hands out , but we did n't know what to say , what move to make . We did not read Adeena ' s hungry stare . As quickly as she had come for Adeena , the trembling woman was gone , a packet of loose tissues flapping on the ground behind her . Adeena in one piece , mittens off and fingering the purse 's cold metal snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Inside my heart grew a slight and marrowless bone . When I tried to move , twisting this way and that , I felt its prick . <p> Author Affiliation
