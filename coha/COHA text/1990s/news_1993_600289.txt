<p> Former Harlem Globetrotter turned executive , Mannie Jackson has worked overtime at improving his game - his business game . <p> Lob him a multimillion-dollar sales opportunity : He 's practiced slam-dunking those . A Honeywell senior vice president , Jackson is equally adept at doing mergers and acquisitions with Jordanesque verve . <p> Jackson figures he 's ready to travel , uh , journey full circle now : He 's trying to buy the Globetrotters in a deal valued at more than $ 6 million . For most people , a deal of that magnitude would be a crowning achievement . Not for Jackson . He views it as the first event in what he expects to be a long , championship run . <p> " My vision . . . is to put together a holding company that essentially embraces entertainment through pay-per-view ( television ) , theaters , sports entertainment , movie and TV productions , publications and a sports-retail outlet , " Jackson says matter-of-factly , as if he were ticking off a grocery list . The first piece of that puzzle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jackson 's investment group by June . <p> Putting together a business empire might seem like a hard sell , but selling is Jackson 's strong suit . " I 'm probably one of the - I say this cautiously - one of the best salesmen in the country , " he says . Last year , he helped Honeywell pull down more then $ 500 million in contracts . <p> Honeywell , which makes building and aviation controls and had revenue of more than $ 6 billion last year , rewarded Jackson this year by naming him to the office of the chairman . <p> After the Globetrotter deal is completed , Jackson plans to remain with Honeywell . A management team will run the franchise on a daily basis . <p> Here for the day to meet with a group of businessmen , Jackson is slightly under the weather , although he does n't look it . His persistent flu bug would go away , he says , if only he were n't on the go so much . For someone who spends 80% of his time away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals , Air Jackson might be a fitting sobriquet . <p> Jackson is n't new to the basketball franchise acquisition game . His first attempt was an air ball . He headed a group trying to bring a National Basketball Association squad to San Diego in 1989 . But the NBA opted not to award that city a franchise . <p> " And when I played ball , I went through the whole thing , too , " Jackson says . " So entertainment and sports and the whole sports arena is not new to me . I understand the responsibilities of ownership . I understand my role , which is not nearly as significant as will be the role of those people I have on the court . " <p> Seated behind a desk in a downtown office building here , Jackson idly files an already immaculately manicured left hand . At 6-foot-2 , he looks trim in his tailored black jacket , white shirt and green pants . He weighs 180 pounds , the same as when he was a Globetrotters guard from 1962 to 1964 and during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneapolis-based International Broadcasting , has operated under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since 1991 .

NatWest is betting on Jackson 's " ability to re-establish ( the Globetrotters ) as a good financial engine , as they have been in the past , " bank executive Dirck Post says . <p> The plan is to have Jackson pay for the team by generating profits , with NatWest selling back its 20% stake within five years . <p> As chairman and principal owner , Jackson will own 35.5% of the Globetrotters . Management will own 10% , and a Jackson partner , Minneapolis businessman Dennis Mathisen , will own 34.5% . Mathisen 's company , Marshall Financial , turns around troubled companies and maps out acquisition financing strategies . Jackson has assembled an advisory board that includes Jesse Jackson and rap artist Hammer . <p> Mannie Jackson says his first order of business will be to create two Globetrotters teams , expanding the franchise 's market coverage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hapless foils who always let the Globetrotters clown their way to victory . The Globetrotters currently play in more than 80 U.S. cities and 50 foreign cities . <p> With his hooded , sleepy-looking eyes and his tight , unlined skin , Jackson , 51 , appears to be in his 30s . He has a seven-figure net worth and a knack for doing multimillion-dollar deals , but his age is one figure he 'd rather forget . A query elicits a dour game face and a testy admission of his age . " I 'm a young man , " he says with a hint of irritation . <p> Born in Edwardsville , Ill. , a community 25 miles east of St. Louis , Jackson comes from hardscrabble beginnings . He was reared by a father who worked in an auto plant , a mother who was a domestic and a strict schoolteacher grandmother who dished out whippings if homework was n't done . Jackson excelled at academics and attended the University of Illinois , where his basketball exploits led to the Globetrotters . <p> Playing with the Globetrotters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fidel Castro . But even during his playing days , he yearned for success in another arena . " I 've always known I wanted to be in business , " he says . " As an athlete , as a young person , I wanted to be a business person . I was intrigued by the interpersonal interactions that go on , and by the challenges . " <p> After his basketball career ended , Jackson took a job with Honeywell in 1968 as an equal employment officer . " I had one hell of a time with it because I made it bigger than life , " he says now . Even so , Jackson 's managerial potential was seen by an executive who became Jackson 's mentor . A combination of sage advice and Jackson 's talent allowed his new-found career to take off . <p> " I met people and made my agenda their agenda and moved through the organization to where I was doing mergers and acquisitions and new ventures and start-up businesses , " Jackson says . He 's also done strategic planning for Honeywell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit . <p> " He 's a guy of eclectic interests , " Honeywell Chairman and CEO Michael Bonsignore says . " That 's one of the things that 's always fascinated me about him , he 's broad in his perspective . I think business tends to focus people narrower and narrower . . . . I 've always been comfortable around people who 've found that other dimension in their lives . " <p> A man who has made enough money to retire comfortably , Jackson admits his Globetrotters quest is partly ego driven . But it 's about more than that . In the realm of professional sports , blacks " dominate the playing field , but we 're nowhere at the top where the action takes place , " Jackson notes . " The real leverage , " he says , " is in ownership .

Remember , along your career people are going to be working for you that are going to think the same thing . So learn to manage both sides of it .

What I 'll do is bring some structure . "
