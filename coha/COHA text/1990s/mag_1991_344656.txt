Planned more than a century ago as a tribute to the landfall of Christopher Columbus in 1492 , a five-story lighthouse now , finally , thrusts itself into the sky over Santo Domingo , in the Dominican Republic . Aggressively supported by the nation 's octogenarian President Joaquin Balaguer , the project will cost , when all the finishing touches are completed , about $20 million . It will also , when the switch is pulled , put on quite a show : 147 giant beams projecting a cross of light 3,000 ft. into the Caribbean night . The lighthouse comes equipped with its own power generators , which was a prudent idea on someone 's part . The Dominican Republic 's electricity system has virtually collapsed for lack of funding . Like the rest of the country , the neighborhoods surrounding this soaring beacon are routinely blacked out 20 hours a day . <P> The grandiose new lighthouse already looks like an anomaly , while the old poverty huddling at its edges seems all too contemporary . Overarching light and enforced darkness , cheek by jowl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500th anniversary of Columbus ' world-shattering voyage , which is itself increasingly seen in opposing terms of black and white . The Columbus quincentennial officially kicks off this Columbus Day , Oct. 12  --  but it has even now generated enough contrast and controversy to outlast its appointed year and , quite possibly , this decade . <P> At the heart of the hubbub lies a fundamental disagreement , not so much about Columbus himself as about the Columbian legacy . What , in other words , did the enigmatic Genoan set in motion when he first reached the New World ? In one version of the story , Columbus and the Europeans who followed him brought civilization to two immense , sparsely populated continents , in the process fundamentally enriching and altering the Old World from which they had themselves come . <P> Among other things , Columbus ' journey was the first step in a long process that eventually produced the United States of America , a daring experiment in democracy that in turn became a symbol and a haven of individual liberty for people throughout the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater than that . It altered science , geography , philosophy , agriculture , law , religion , ethics , government  --  the sum , in other words , of what passed at the time as Western culture . <P> Increasingly , however , there is a counterchorus , an opposing rendition of the same events that deems Columbus ' first footfall in the New World to be fatal to the world he invaded , and even to the rest of the globe . The indigenous peoples and their cultures were doomed by European arrogance , brutality and infectious diseases . Columbus ' gift was slavery to those who greeted him ; his arrival set in motion the ruthless destruction , continuing at this very moment , of the natural world he entered . Genocide , ecocide , exploitation  --  even the notion of Columbus as a " discoverer "  --  are deemed to be a form of Eurocentric theft of history from those who watched Columbus ' ships drop anchor off their shores . <P> Not surprisingly , those who see Columbus ' journey as a triumph of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a hemispheric rape do not have many kindly things to say to one another . But they are shouting a lot , and this clamor , so far , has defined the ceremonies to come .
