 | do was stand and watch as he stirred up the coals , pulled out the ruddiest iron and turned toward me . He was just drawing a bead on my right eyeball when my brain got back in gear . " Of course , " I said . " Blinding is only right . But in my case you will have to blind me later , before I leave the Holy of Holies , not now . I need my eyes to see and mend the Fount of Holy Waters . Once the waters flow again , I will laugh as I hurl myself on the burning iron . " He took a good thirty seconds to think it over and in the end had to agree with me . The local torturer sniffled a bit and threw a little more charcoal on the fire . The gate crashed open and I stalked through ; then it banged to behind me and I was alone in the dark . But not for long  --  there was a shuffling nearby and I took a chance and turned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their eye sockets red pits of burned flesh . They knew what I wanted and led the way without a word . A crumbling and cracked stone stairway brought us up by a solid metal doorway labeled in archaic script MARK III BEACON ENTRANCE TO AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY . The overly trusting builders had counted on the sign to do the whole job , for there was n't a trace of a lock on the door . One lizard merely turned the handle and we were inside the beacon . I unzipped the front of my camouflage suit and pulled out the blueprints . With the faithful priests stumbling after me I approached the antique machinery . There was a residue of charge in the emergency batteries , just enough to give a dim light . The meters and indicators looked to be in good shape ; if anything , unexpectedly bright from constant polishing . I checked the readings carefully and found just what I had suspected . One of the eager lizards had managed to open a circuit box and had polished the switches inside . While doing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caused the trouble . Rather , that had started the trouble . It was n't going to be  | ended by just reversing the water-valve switch . This valve was supposed to be used only for repairs , and then only after the atomic pile had been damped . When the water was cut off with the pile in operation , it had started to overheat and the automatic safeties had dumped the whole works down into the pit . I could start the water again easily enough , but there was no fuel left in the reactor . But I was n't going to play with the fuel problem at all . It would be far easier for me to install a new power plant . I had one in the ship that was about a tenth of the size of the ancient bucket of bolts . Before I sent for it , I checked over the rest of the beacon . In two thousand years there should be some signs of wear , tear , and fatigue . The old boys had built well , I 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no moving parts and had suffered no wear whatever . Other parts they beefed up figuring they would wear , but slowly . The water-feed pipe from the roof , for example . The pipe walls were at least three meters thick and the pipe opening itself no bigger than my head . There were some things I could do , though , and I made a list of parts . The parts , the new power plant , and a few other odds and ends were sorted into a neat pile on the ship . I checked all the parts by screen before they were loaded into a small metal crate . In the darkest hour before dawn ' , the heavy-duty Eye dropped the crate outside the temple and darted away without being seen . I watched the priests through the Pryeye while they tried to open it . When they had given up , I boomed orders at them through a speaker in the crate . They spent most of the day sweating the heavy box up through the narrow temple stairs , and I enjoyed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I woke up . The repair did n't take long , though there was plenty of groaning from the blind lizards when they heard me ripping  | the wall open to get to the power leads . I even hooked a gadget to the water pipe so their Holy Waters would have the usual refreshing radioactivity when they started flowing again . The moment this was all finished , I did the job they waited for . I threw the switch that started the water flowing again . There were a few minutes while the water began to gurgle down through the dry pipe . Then a roar came from outside the pyramid that must have shaken its stone walls . Shaking my hands once over my head , I went down for the eye-burning ceremony . The blind lizards were waiting for me by the door and looked even unhappier than usual . When I tried the door , I found out why  --  it was bolted and barred from the other side . " It has been decided , " a lizard said , " that you shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will stay with you and serve your every need . " A delightful prospect , eternity spent in a locked beacon with three blind lizards . In spite of their hospitality , I could n't accept . " What ! You dare interfere with the messenger of your ancestors ! " I had the speaker on full volume and the vibration almost shook my head off . The lizards cringed , and I set my Solar for a narrow beam and ran it around the doorjamb . There was a great crunching and banging from the junk piled against it , and then the door swung free . I threw it open . Before they could protest , I had pushed the priests out through it . The rest of their clan showed up at the foot of the stairs and made a great ruckus while I finished welding the door shut . Running through the crowd , I faced up to the First Lizard in his tub . He sank slowly beneath the surface . " What lack of courtesy ! " I shouted . He made little bubbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have decided to forbid entrance to the Inner Temple forever . Though , out of  | their eternal kindness , they will let the waters flow . Now I must return  --  so on with the eyeball ceremony ! " The torture-master was too frightened to move , so I grabbed his hot iron out of the coals . A touch on the side of my face dropped a steel plate over my eyes , under the plastiskin . Then I jammed the iron hard into my phony eye sockets and the plastic gave off an authentic odor . A cry went up from the crowd as I dropped the iron and staggered in blind circles . I must admit it went off pretty well . But enough was enough . Before they could get any more bright ideas , I threw the switch and my plastic pterodactyl sailed in through the door . I could n't see it , of course , but I knew it had arrived when the grapples in the claws latched onto the steel plates on my shoulders . I had got turned around after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had meant to sail out bravely , blind eyes facing into the sunset ; instead , I faced the crowd as I soared away , so I made the most of a bad situation and threw them a snappy military salute . Then I was out in the fresh air and away . When I lifted the plate and poked holes in the seared plastic , I could see the pyramid growing smaller behind me , water gushing out of the base and a happy crowd of reptiles sporting in its radioactive rush . I counted off on , my talons to see if I had forgotten anything . One : The beacon was repaired . Two : The door was sealed , so there should be no more sabotage , accidental or deliberate . Three : The priests should be satisfied . The water was running again , my eyes had been duly burned out , and they were back in business . Which added up to Four : The fact that they would probably let another repairman in , under the same conditions , if the beacon conked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like butchering a few of  | them , that would make them antagonistic toward future ancestral messengers . I stripped off my tattered lizard suit back in the ship , very glad it would be some other repairman who would get the job .  | Livermore liked the view from the little white balcony outside his office . Even though the air at this height , at this time of year , had a chill bite to it . He was standing there now , trying to suppress a shiver , looking out at the new spring green on the hillsides and the trees in the old town . Above and below him the white steps of the levels of New Town stretched away in smooth elegance . A great A in space with the base a half-mile wide , rising up almost to a point on top . Every level fringed with a balcony , every balcony with an unobstructed view . Well designed . Livermore shivered again and felt the loud beat of his heart ; old valves cheered on by new drugs . His insides were as carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building . Though his outside left a lot to be desired . Brown spots , wrinkles , and white hair ; he looked as weathered as the homes in Old Town . It was damned cold and the sun went behind a cloud . He thumbed a button , and when the glass wall slid aside , went back gratefully into the purified and warmed air of the interior . " Been waiting long ? " he asked the old man who sat , scowling , in the chair on the far side of his desk . " Well , you asked , Doctor . I was never one to complain , but ... "  | " Then do n't start now . Stand up . Open your shirt . Let me have those records . Ahh , Grazer , I remember you . Planted a kidney seed , did n't they ? How do you feel ? " " Poorly , that 's the only word for it . Off my feed , ca n't sleep . When I do I wake up with the cold sweats . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Hey ! " Livermore slapped the cold pickup of the stethoscope against the bare skin of Grazer 's chest . Patients liked Dr. Livermore but hated his stethoscope , swearing that he must keep it specially chilled for them . They were right . There was a thermoelectric cooling plate in the case . Livermore felt that it gave them something to think about . " Hmmrr . . . " he said , frowning , the earpieces in his ears , hearing nothing . He had plugged the stethoscope with wax a year earlier . The systolic , diastolic murmurs disturbed his concentration ; he heard enough of that from his own chest . Everything was in the records in any case , since the analysis machines did a far better job than he could ever do . He flipped through the sheets and graphs . " Button your shirt , sit down , take two of these right now . Just the thing for this condition . " He shook the large red sugar pills from the jar in his desk drawer and pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly : this was real medicine . Livermore found the most recent X rays and snapped them into the viewer . Lovely . The new kidney was growing , as sweetly formed as a little bean . Still tiny now beside its elderly brother , but in a year 's time they would be identical . Science conquereth all , or at least almost all ; he slammed the file on the table . It had been a difficult morning , and even this afternoon surgery was not as relaxing as it usually was . The old folks , the AKs , his peer group , they appreciated one another . Very early in his career he had taken his M.D. ; that was all that they knew about him . A doctor , their age . He sometimes wondered if they connected him at all with the Dr.  | Rex Livermore in charge of the ectogenetic program . That is , if they had ever heard of the program . " I 'm sure glad for the pills , Doc . I do n't like those shots no more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowels . They 're as old as my bowels and in just as good shape . You 're just bored , that 's your trouble . " Grazer nodded approvingly at the insults  --  a touch of interest in an otherwise sterile existence . " Bored is the very word , Doc . The hours I spend on the pot " " What did you do before you retired ? " " That was a real long time ago . " " Not so long that you ca n't remember . And if you ca n't , why then you 're just too old to waste food and space on . We 'll just have to hook that old brain out of your skull and put it in a bottle with a label saying senile brain on it . " Grazer chuckled ; he might have cried if someone younger had talked to him this way . " Said it was a long time ago , did n't say I forgot . Painter . Housepainter , not the artist kind , worked at it eighty years before the union threw me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at it ? " " The best . They do n't have my kind of painter around anymore . " " I ca n't believe that . I 'm getting damn tired of the eggshell off-white superplastic eternal finish on the walls of this office . Think you could repaint it for me ? " " Paint wo n't stick to that stuff . " " If I find one that will ? " " I 'm your man , Doc . " " It 'll take time . Sure you wo n't mind missing all the basketweaving , social teas , and television ? " Grazer snorted in answer , and he almost smiled . " All right , I 'll get in touch with you . Come back in a month in any case so I can look at that kidney . As for the rest , you 're  | in perfect shape after your geriatric treatments . You 're just bored with television and the damned baskets . " " You can say that again . Do n't forget about that paint , hear ? " A distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picking up the phone as soon as the old man had gone . Leatha Crabb 's tiny and distraught image looked up at him from the screen . " Oh , Dr. Livermore , another bottle failure . " " I know . I was in the lab this morning . I 'll be down there at fifteen hundred and we can talk about it then . " He hung up and looked at his watch . Twenty minutes until the meeting ? he still had time to see another patient or two . Geriatrics was not his field , and he really had very little interest in it . It was the people who interested him . He sometimes wondered if they knew how little they needed him , now that they were on constant monitoring and automated medical attention . Perhaps they just enjoyed seeing and talking to him as he did to them . No harm done in any case . The next patient was a thin , white-haired woman who began complaining as she came through the door . Did not stop even as she put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livermore nodded and made doodles on the pad before him and admired her flow of comment , criticism , and invective over a complaint she had covered so well and so often before . It was just a foot she was talking about , which might seem a limited area of discussion  --  toes , tendons , and not much else . But she had unusual symptoms , hot flushes and itching in addition to the usual pain , all of which was made even more interesting by the fact that the foot under discussion had been amputated over sixty years earlier . Phantom limbs with phantom symptoms were nothing new  --  there were even reported cases of completely paralyzed patients with phantom sexual impulses terminating in phantom orgasms but the longevity of this case was certainly worth noting . He relaxed under the  | wave of detailed complaint , and when he finally gave her some of the sugar pills and ushered her out , they both felt a good deal better . Catherine Ruffin and Sturtevant were already waiting in the boardroom when he came in . Sturtevant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble tabletop , one of his cancer-free tobacco-substitute cigarettes dangling from his lip . His round and thick glasses and sharp nose made him resemble an owl , but the thin line of his mouth was more like that of a turtle . It was a veritable bestiary of a face . His ears could be those of a moose , Livermore thought , then sniffed and rubbed his nose . " Those so-called cigarettes of yours smell like burning garbage , Sturtevant , do you know that ? " " You have told him that before , " Catherine Ruffin said in her slow , careful English . She had emigrated in her youth from South Africa , to marry the long-dead Mr. Ruffin , and still had the accents of her Boer youth . Full-bosomed and round in a very Dutch-housewife manner , she was nevertheless a senior administrator with a mind like a computer . " Never mind my cigarettes . " Sturtevant grubbed the butt out and instantly groped for a fresh one . " Ca n't you be on time just once for one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and switched on the recorder . " Minutes of the meeting of the Genetic Guidance Council , Syracuse New Town , Tuesday , January 14 , 2025 . Present ? Ruffin , Sturtevant , Livermore . Ruffin chairman . " " What 's this I hear about more bottle failures ? " Sturtevant asked . Livermore dismissed the matter with a wave of his hand . " A few bottle failures are taken for granted . I 'll look into these latest ones and have a full report for our next meeting . Just a mechanical foul-up and nothing to bother us here . What does bother me is our genetic priorities . I have a list . "  | He searched the pockets of his jacket , one after another , while Sturtevant frowned his snapping-turtle frown at him . " You and your lists , Livermore . We 've read enough of them . Priorities are a thing of the past . We now have a prepared program that we need only follow . " " Priorities are not outdated . And by saying that , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetics . " " You 're insulting ! " " It 's the truth . Too bad if it hurts . " He found a crumpled piece of paper in an inside pocket and smoothed it out on the table before him . " You 're so used to your damn charts and graphs , demographic curves and projections that you think they are really a description of the real world  --  instead of being rough approximations well after the fact . I 'm not going to trouble you with figures . They 're so huge as to be meaningless . But I want you to consider for a moment the incredible complexity of our genetic pool . Mankind as we know it has been around about a half-million years , mutating , changing , and interbreeding . Every death in all those generations was a selection of some kind , as was every mating . Good and bad traits , pro- and anti-survival mutations , big brains and hemophilia , hairy armpits and agile fingers . Everything happened and all this was stirred up and spread through the human race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race by gene selection . We have an endless reservoir of traits to draw from , ova from every woman , sperm from every man . We can analyze these for genetic composition , then feed the results to the computer to work out favorable combinations . After that we combine the sperm and ova and grow the fetus ectogenetically . If all goes well , nine months later we decant the infant of our selection and the human race has been improved by that small increment . But what is an improvement , what is a favorable combination ? Dark skin is a survival trait in the tropics , but dark skin in the northern hemisphere cuts off too much ul-  | traviolet so the body can not manufacture vitamin D , and rickets follows . Everything is relative . " " We have been over this ground before , " Catherine Ruffin said . " But not often enough . If we do n't constantly renew and review our goals , we are going to start down a one-way road . Once genetic traits have been discarded they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego New City have an easier job . They have a specific goal . They are out to build new breeds of men , specific types for different environments . Like the spacemen who can live without physical or mental breakdowns during the decade-long trips to the outer planets . Or the lowtemperature-and low-pressure-resistant types for Mars settlers . They can discard genes ruthlessly and aim for a clear and well-established goal . We simply aim to improve  --  and what a vague ambition that is . But while we are making this new race of supermen what will we lose ? Will new-man be pink , and if so , what has happened to the Oriental and the Negro ? " " For God 's sake , Livermore , let us not start on that again , " Sturtevant shouted . " We have fixed charts , rules , regulations , everything carefully mapped out for all the operations . " " I said you had no real knowledge of genetics and that proves it once again . You simply ca n't get it through your head that genetic selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game starts completely over again . As they say in the historical 3V 's , it 's a brand-new ball game . The entire world is born anew with every child . " " I think you tend to overdramatize , " Catherine Ruffin said stolidly . " Not in the slightest . Genes are not bricks . We ca n't use them to build a desired structure to order . We just aim for optimum , then see what we have and try again . No directives can lay down the details of every choice or control every random combination . Every technician is a small god , making  | 1 3 real decisions of life and death . And some of these decisions are questionable in the long run . " " Impossible , " Sturtevant said , and Catherine Ruffin nodded agreement . " No , it 's just going to be very expensive . We must find a closer examination of every change made and get some predictions of where we are going . " " You are out of order , Dr. Livermore , " Catherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past , a budget forecast was estimated , and the entire matter was then turned down because of cost . This was not our decision you will recall , but came down from Genguidecounchief . We accomplish nothing by raking over these well-raked coals yet another time . There is new business we must consider that I wish to place before this council . " Livermore had the beginnings of a headache , and he fumbled a pill from the carrier in his pocket . The other two were talking , and he paid them no attention at all . When Leatha Crabb hung up the phone after talking with Dr. Livermore , she felt as though she wanted to cry . She had been working long hours for weeks and not getting enough sleep . Her eyes stung , and she was a little ashamed of this unaccustomed weakness : she was the sort of person who simply did not cry , woman or no . But seventeen bottle failures , seventeen deaths . Seventeen tiny lives snuffed out before they had barely begun to live . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " So small you ca n't hardly see it , " Veazy said . The laboratory assistant held one of the disconnected bottles up to the light and gave it a shake to swish the liquid about inside it . " You sure it 's dead ? " " Stop that ! " Leatha snapped , then curbed her temper : she had always prided herself on the way that she treated those  | who worked beneath her . " Yes , they are all dead , I 've checked that . Decant , freeze , and label them . I 'll want to do examinations later . " Veazy nodded and took the bottle away . She wondered what had possessed her thinking of them as lives , children . She must be tired . They were groups of growing cells with no more personality than the cells grouped in the wart on the back of her hand . She rubbed at it , reminding herself again that she ought to have it taken care of . A handsome , well-formed girl in her early thirties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to match . But her hair was cropped short , close to her head , and she wore not the slightest trace of makeup , while the richness of her figure was lost in the heavy folds of her white laboratory smock . She was too young for it , but a line of worry was already beginning to form between her eyes . When she bent over her microscope , peering at the stained slide , the furrow deepened . The bottle failures troubled her , deeply , more than she liked to admit . The program had gone so well the past few years that she was beginning to take it for granted , already looking ahead to the genetic possibilities of the second generation . It took a decided effort to forget all this and turn back to the simple mechanical problems of ectogenesis ... . Strong arms wrapped about her from behind ; the hands pressed firmly against the roundness of her body below the waist ; hard lips kissed the nape of her neck . " Do n't ! " she said , surprised , pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped his arms at once , stepping back from her . " You do n't have to get angry , " he said . " We 're married you know , and no one is watching . " " It 's not your pawing me I do n't like . But I 'm working , ca n't you see that ? " Leatha turned to face him , angry at his physical touch despite her words . He stood dumbly before her , a solid black. -  | haired and dark-complexioned man with slightly protruding lower lip that made him look , now , as though he were pouting . " You need n't look so put out . It 's work time , not play time . " " Damn little playtime " anymore . " He glanced quickly around to see if anyone was within earshot . " Not the way it was when we were first married . You were pretty affectionate then . " He reached out a slow finger and pressed it to his midriff . " Do n't do that . " She drew away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been absolute hell here today . A defective valve in one of the hormone feed lines , discovered too late . We lost seventeen bottles . In an early stage , luckily . " " So what 's the loss ? There must be a couple of billion sperm and ova in the freezers . They 'll pair some more and put you back in business . " " Think of the work and labor in gene-matching , all wasted . " " That 's what technicians are paid for . It will give them something to do . Look , can we forget work for a while , take off an evening ? Go to Old Town . There 's a place there I heard about , Sharm 's . They have real cult cooking and entertain-ment . " " Ca n't we talk about it later ? This really is n't the time .... " " By Christ , it never is . I 'll be back here at seventeen thirty . See if you ca n't possibly make your mind up by then . " He pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism prevented him from slamming it behind him . Something had gone out of life , he was n't sure just what . He loved Leatha and she loved him , he was sure of that , but something was missing . They both had their work to do , but it had never caused trouble before . They were used to it , even staying up all night sometimes , working in the same room in quiet companionship . Then coffee , perhaps as dawn was breaking , a drowsy pleasant fatigue , falling into bed , making  | love . It just was n't that way anymore and he could n't think why . At the elevators he entered the nearest and called out , " Fifty . " The doors closed , and the car fell smoothly away . They would go out tonight : he was resolved that this evening would be different . Only after he had emerged from the elevator did he realize that it had stopped at the wrong floor . Fifteen , not fifty ; the number analyzer in the elevator computer always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could turn , the doors shut behind him , and he noticed the two old men frowning in his direction . He was on one of the eldster floors . Instead of waiting for another car , he turned away from their angry looks and hurried down the hall . There were other old people about , some shuffling along , others riding powered chairs , and he looked straight ahead so he would n't catch their eyes . They resented youngsters coming here . Well , he resented them occupying his brand-new building . That was n't a nice thought , and he was sorry at once for even thinking a thing like that . This was n't his building ; he was just one of the men on the design team who had stayed on for construction . The eldsters had as much right here as he did , more so , since this was their home . And a pleasant compromise it had been , too . This building , New Town , was designed for the future , but the future was rather slow coming , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . Nine months from conception to birth , in either bottle or womb . Then the slow years of childhood , the quick years of puberty . It would be wasteful for the city to stay vacant all those years . That was where the eldsters came in , the leftover debris of an overpopulated world . Geriatrics propped them up and kept them going . They were growing older together , the last survivors of the greedy generations . They were the parents who had fewer children and even fewer grandchildren as the realities of famine , disease , and the general unwholesomeness of life were  | driven home to them . Not that they had done this voluntarily . Left alone they would have responded as every other generation of mankind had done : selfishly . If the world is going to be overpopulated  --  it is going to be overpopulated with my kids . But the breakthrough in geriatric treatment and drugs came along at that moment and provided a far better carrot than had ever been held in front of the human donkey before . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The birthrate dived to zero almost overnight . The indifferent overpopulators had decided to overpopulate with themselves instead of their children . If life was being granted , they preferred to have it granted to them . The result was that a child of the next generation might have , in addition to his mother and father , a half-dozen surviving relatives who were elders . A married couple might have ten or fifteen older relatives , all of them alone in the world , looking to their only younger kin . There could be no question of this aging horde moving in with the present generation , who had neither room for them nor money to support them . They were a government burden and would remain so . A decreasing burden that required less money every year as old machinery , despite the wonders of medicine , finally ran down . When the new cities were being designed for the future , scientifically planned generations , the wise decision had been made to move the eldsters into them . The best of food ; care , and medicine could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the older cities would be happier , relieved of the weight of the solid block of aging citizenry . And since the geriatric drugs did n't seem to work too well past the middle of the second century , a timetable could be established for what was euphemistically called " phasing out . " Dying was a word no one liked to use . So as the present inhabitants were phased out to the phasing place of their choice , the growing generations would move in . All neat . All tidy . As long as you stayed away from the eldster floors .  | Looking straight ahead , Gust went swiftly along the streetlike corridor . Ignoring the steam rooms and bathing rooms , tropical gardens and sandy beaches that opened off to either side . And the people . The next bank of elevators was a welcome sight , and this time he very clearly enunciated " fif-tee " as the door closed . When he reached the end of the unfinished corridor , the work shift was just going off duty . The flooring terminated here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still showing the mold marks where it had been cast in place ; floodlights stood high on wiry legs . " Been having trouble with the squatter , Mr. Crabb , " the shift boss complained . These men had grown up in a world of smoothly operating machines and were hurt when they occasionally proved fallible . " I 'll take a look at it . Anything in the hopper ? " " Half full . Should I empty it out ? " " No , leave it . I 'll try a run before I call maintenance . " As the motors on the machines were turned off one by one , an echoing silence fell on the immense and cavernlike area . The men went away , their footsteps loud , calling to each other , until Gust was alone . He climbed the ladder to the top of the hulking squatter and unlocked the computer controls . When he typed a quick condition query the readout revealed nothing wrong . These semi-intelligent machines could analyze most of their own troubles and deliver warnings , but there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize . Gust closed the computer and pressed the power button . There was a far-off rumble and the great bulk of the machine shuddered as it came to life . Most of the indicator lights blinked on red , turning swiftly to green as the motors came to speed . When the operation-ready light also turned green , he squinted at the right-hand television screen , which showed the floor level buried under the squatter . The newly laid flooring  | ended abruptly where the machine had stopped . He backed it a few feet so the sensors could come into operation , then started it forward again at the crawling pace of working speed . As soon as the edge was reached the laying began again . The machine guided itself and controlled the mix and pouring . About all the operator had to do was turn the entire apparatus on and off . Gust watched the hypnotically smooth flow of new floor appear and could see nothing wrong . It was pleasant here , doing a simple yet important job like this . A warning buzzer sounded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked and had a quick glimpse of something black on the screen before it moved swiftly out of sight . He stopped the forward motion and put the squatter into reverse again , backing the huge mass a good ten feet before killing all the power and climbing back down . The newly laid plastic flooring was still hot under his feet and he trod gingerly almost up to the forward edge . There was a cavity in the flooring here , like a bowl or a bubble a foot wide . As though the machine had burped while spewing out its flow . Perhaps it had . The technicians would set it right . He spoke a note to call them in his pocket phone , killed all except the standby lights , then went back to the elevators . Calling out his floor number very carefully . Dr. Livermore and Leatha were bent over a worktable in the lab , heads lowered as though at a wake . As perhaps they were . Gust came in quietly , listening , not wanting to interrupt . " There were some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The Reilly-Stone in particular . I do n't know how much computer time was used in the preliminary selection , but the technicians must have put in a hundred hours on this fertilized ovum alone . " " Is n't that a little unusual ? " Livermore asked . " I imagine so , but it was the first application of the Bershock multiple-division cross-trait selection , and you know how those things go . "  | " I do indeed . It will be easier the next time . Send the records back , noting the failures . Get them started on replacements . Hello , Gust , I did n't hear you come in . " " I did n't want to bother you . " " No bother . We are finished in any case . Had some bottle failures today . " " So I heard . Do you know why ? " " If I knew everything , I would be God , would n't I ?

" " We 're going to Old Town , Doctor , " Gust said , uncomfortable with this kind of abstract conversation and eager to change the subject . " Do n't let me stop you . Do n't bring back any infections , hear ? " Livermore turned to leave , but the door opened before he reached it . A man stood there , looking at them without speaking . He entered , and the silence and the severe set of his features struck them silent as well . When the door had closed behind him he called their names in a deep voice , looking at each of them in turn as he spoke . " Dr. Livermore , Leatha Crabb , Gust Crabb . I am here to see you . My name is Blalock . " It was clear that Livermore did not enjoy being addressed in this manner . " Call my secretary for an appointment . I 'm busy now . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time taking a thin wallet from his pocket . " I would like to see you now , Doctor . This is my identifica-tion . " Livermore could not have left without pushing the man aside . He stopped and blinked at the golden badge . " FBI . What on earth are you after here ? "  | " A killer . " A stunned silence followed . " I can tell you now , though I would appreciate your not telling anyone else , that one of the technicians working here is an agent from the bureau . He makes regular reports to Washington about conditions on the project . " " Meddling and spying ! " Livermore was angry . " Not at all . The government has a large investment here and believes in protecting it  --  and in guarding the taxpayers ' money . You have had a number of bottle failures here in the first weeks after implanting . " " Accidents , just accidents , " Leatha said , then flushed and was silent when Blalock turned his cold , unsmiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . There are four other New Towns in the United States , all of them with projects working along the same lines as yours . They have had bottle failures as well , but not in the numbers you have here . " " A few more in one place or another means nothing , " Livermore said . " The law of averages covers minor differ-ences . " " I 'm sure it does . Minor differences , Doctor . But the rate of failure here is ten times higher than that of the other laboratories . For every bottle failure they have , you have ten . For their ten , you have a hundred . I am not here by accident . Since you are in charge of this project , I would like a letter from you giving me permission to go anywhere on the premises and to speak with anyone . " " My secretary will have gone by now . In the morning " I have the letter here , typed on your stationery . It just needs your signature . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't have this . Stealing my office supplies . I wo n't have it . " " Do n't be rude , Doctor . Your stationery is printed by the Government Printing Office . They supplied it to me to make my job easier . Do n't you make it harder . "  | There was a coldness in that you that stopped Livermore and sent him fumbling with his pen to sign the letter . Gust and Leatha looked on , not knowing what to do . Blalock folded the letter and put it back into his pocket . " I 'll want to talk to you all later , " he said , and left . Livermore waited until he was gone , then went out as well , without a word . " What an awful man , " Leatha said . " It does n't matter how awful he is if what he said was right . Bottle sabotage  --  can that be ? " " Easily enough done . " " But why should it be done ? " Gust asked . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so wanton . There 's simply no reason . " " That 's Blalock 's worry , what he 's getting paid for . Right now I 've had a long day , and I 'm hungry and more concerned with my dinner . You go ahead to the apartment and defrost something . I wo n't be a minute finishing up these tests . " He was angry . " The first blush is off our marriage , is n't it ? You 've completely forgotten that I asked you out to dinner in Old Town . " " It 's not that . . . " Leatha said , then stopped , because it really was . Gust was n't completely right ; the work was so distracting , and then this Blalock person . She tidied up quickly without finishing the tests and took off her smock . Her dress was dark gray and no less severe . It was thin , too , designed for wear in the constant temperature of New Town . " If it 's cold outside , I should get a coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still March . I checked out a car earlier and put your heavy coat in it . Mine as well . " They went in silence to the elevator and down to the parking level . The bubble-dome car was at the ready ramp ; the top swung up when he turned the handle . They put on their coats before they climbed in , and Gust turned on the heat as he started the car . The battery-powered electric engine hummed  | strongly as they headed for the exit , the doors opened automatically for them as the car approached . There was a brief wait in the lock while the inner door closed before the outer one opened ; then they emerged on the sloping ramp that led up to Old Town . It had been a long time since their last visit outside the New Town walls , and the difference was striking . The streets were patched and had an unkempt appearance , with dead grass and weeds protruding from the cracks . There were pieces of paper caught against the curbs , and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Leatha sank deeper into her seat and shivered even though the heater was going full on . The buildings had a weathered and even a decayed look about them , the wooden buildings most of all , and the limbs of the gray trees were bare as skeletons in the fading daylight . Gust tried to read the street signs and lost his way once , but finally found a garish spotlit sign that read SHARM 'S . Either they were early or business was n't booming , because they could park right in front of the door . Leatha did n't wait but ran the few feet through the chill wind while Gust locked up the car . Inside , Sharm himself was waiting to greet them . " Welcome , welcome , " he said with bored professional exuberance . A tall , wide Negro , very black , wearing a brilliant kaftan and red fez . " I 've got just the table for you , right at the ringside . " " That will be nice , " Gust said . Sharm 's hospitality was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restaurant . A heavy smell of cooking hung in the air , some of it not too fresh , and the tablecloth was a cartography of ancient stains only partially removed . " Like a drink ? " Sharm asked . " I guess so . Any suggestions ? " " Bet your life . Bloody Mary with tequila , the house special . I 'll fetch a jug . " They must have been premixed , because he was back a  | moment later with the tray and two menus tucked under his arm . He poured their drinks and then one for himself and pulled up a chair to join them . The atmosphere of Sharm 's was nothing if not relaxed . " Salud , " he said , and they drank . Leatha puckered her lips and put her glass down quickly , but Gust liked the sharp bite of the drink . " Great . Never tasted one before . How about the menu ? any house specials there ? " " Everything 's special . My wife is great at any kind of cultfood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boston baked beans , we got them all . Just take your pick . Music 's starting now , and Aikane will be in to dance in about a half an hour . Drink up , folks , these are on the house . " " Very kind , " Gust said , sipping his . " Not at all . I want to pump your brain , Mr. Crabb , and I pay in advance . I saw you on 3V last week talking about New Town . Pretty fancy if I say so myself . What 's the chances of opening a restaurant in your place ? " He drained his glass and poured himself another one , topping up their glasses at the same time . " That 's not easy to say . " " What 's easy ? Living on the dole and maybe blowing your brains out from boredom , that 's easy . Me , I got bigger plans . Everyone likes cultfood . Eldsters , reminds them of the old days ; kids think it 's real pit-blasting . But people here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much loose pesos around . Got to go to where the change is . New Town . What 're the odds ? " " I can find out . But you have to realize , Mr. Sharm ... " " Just plain Sharm . A first name . " " You have to realize that the eldsters have special diets , special sanitary regulations on their food . " " This beanery is n't bug-finky . We got plenty of sanitary examinations . "  | " That 's not what I meant , I 'm sorry , do n't misunderstand me . It 's special diets really , to go with the medication . Really special if you understand , practically worked out and cooked in the labs . " A loud drumming interrupted him as a sad-looking American Indian did a quick Indian war beat on the bass drum . He switched on the audio with his toe , then worked rhythm on the traps as the recording played an Israeli folk song . It was all very unimpressive but loud . " What about the younger people then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you folks . You come this far to eat cultfood , why not have it closer to home ? " " There 's not enough of us , not yet . Just technicians and construction teams . No more than ten percent of the children who will occupy the city have even been born yet , so I do n't know if you even have a big enough group to draw from . Later , perhaps . " " Yeah , later . Big deal . Wait twenty years . " Sharm sank down , wrapped in gloom , moving only to empty the jug into his glass . He rose reluctantly when another customer entered , ending the embarrassing interlude . They both ordered mixed plates of all the specialties and a bottle of wine , since Leatha was not that enthusiastic about the Bloody Marys . While they ate , a slightly dark-skinned girl , of possibly Hawaiian descent , emerged from the rear and did an indifferent hula . Gust looked on with some pleasure , since she wore only a low-slung grass skirt with many tufts missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jiggling that added a certain something to the dance . " Vulgar , " Leatha said , wiping her eyes with her napkin after taking too much horseradish on her gefilte fish . " I do n't think so . " He put his hand on her leg under the table , and she pushed it away without changing expression . " Do n't do that in public . " " Or in private either ! Damn it , Lea , what 's happening to  | our marriage ? We both work , A-OK , that 's fine , but what about our life together ? What about our raising a newborn ? " " We 've talked about this before .... " " You 've said no before , that 's what has happened . Look , Lea honey , I 'm not trying to push you back to the Middle Ages with one in the hand , one on the hip , and one in the belly . Women have been relieved at last of all the trouble and danger of childbirth , but by God they are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of couples do n't want kids , fine , and I agree that creche-raised babies have all the advantages . But other couples are raising babies , and women can even nurse them after the right injections . " " You do n't think I 'd do that ? " " I 'm not asking you to do that  --  as you so sweetly put it though it 's nowhere near as shocking as your tone of voice indicates . I would just like you to consider raising a child , a son . He would be with us evenings and weekends . It would be fun . " " Not exactly my idea of fun . " The answer that was on his lips was sharp , bitter , and nasty and would have surely started an even worse fight , but before he could speak she grabbed him by the arm . " Gust , there in the corner at that back table  --  is n't that the horrible person who was at the lab ? " " Blalock ? Yes , it looks like him . Though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference does it make ? " " Do n't you realize that if he is here , he followed us and is watching us ? He thinks we may have been responsible for the bottle failures . " " You 're imagining too much . Maybe he just likes cultfood . He looks the type who might even live on it . " Yet why was he at the restaurant ? If he was there to worry them , he succeeded . Leatha pushed her plate away and Gust had little appetite as well . He called for the check and , depressed in spirits , they shrugged into their coats and went out  | into the cold night , past the silent and accusing eyes of Sharm , who knew he was not going to live the new life in New Town no matter how much he wanted to . Many years before , Catherine Ruffin had developed a simple plan to enable her to get her work done , a plan that was not part of her work routine . She had discovered , early in her career , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory that were great assets in her work . But she had to study facts slowly and deliberately without interruptions , something that was impossible during the routine of a busy office day . Staying after work was not the answer ; the phone still rang , and she was often too fatigued to make the most of the opportunity . Nor was it always possible to bring work back to her apartment . Since she had always been an early riser , she found that her colleagues were all slugabeds and would rather do anything than come to work five minutes early . She went to her office now at seven every morning and had the solid core of her work done before anyone else appeared . It was a practical and satisfactory solution to the problem and one that appealed to her . However , she was so used to being alone at these early hours that she looked upon anyone else 's presence as an interruption and an annoyance . She found the note on her desk when she came in ; it certainly had not been there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quite clear : Please see me now in bottlelab . Urgent . R. Livermore . She was annoyed at the tone and the interruption and , perhaps , the idea that someone had actually come to work before her . Been here all night , more likely ; the scientific staff tended to do that unless specifically forbidden . Still it looked urgent , so she had better comply . There would be time for  | recriminations later if Livermore had overstepped himself . She put her massive purse in the bottom drawer of her desk and went to the elevator . There was no one in sight on the laboratory floor , nor in the office when she went in . A motion caught her eye , and she turned to look at the door that led into the bottle rooms ; it was closed now  --  yet she had the feeling that it had moved a moment before . Perhaps Livermore had gone through and was waiting for her . As she started forward there was the sharp sound of breaking glass from behind the door , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began ringing loudly in the distance . She gasped and stood frozen an instant at the suddenness of it . Someone was in there , breaking the apparatus . The bottles ! Running heavily , she threw the door open and rushed inside . Glass littered the floor ; fluids still dripped from the shattered bottles . There was no one there . She looked about her , stunned by the destruction and the suddenness , shocked by the abrupt termination of these carefully plotted lives . The almost invisible masses of cells that were to be the next generation were dying , even while she stood there gaping . And there was nothing she could do about it . It was horrifying , and she could not move . Shards of glass were at her feet and in the midst of the glass and the widening pool of liquid was a hammer . The killer 's weapon ? She bent down and picked the hammer up and when she stood upright again someone spoke behind her . " Turn about slowly . Do n't do anything you 'll regret . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything was happening too fast , and she could not grasp the reality of it . " What ? " she said . " What ? " Turning to look at the stranger in the doorway behind her , who held what appeared to be a revolver . " Put that hammer down slowly , " he said . " Who are you ? " The hammer clattered on the floor .  | " I 'll ask the same thing of you . I am Blalock , FBI . My identification is here . " He held out his badge . " Catherine Ruffin . I was sent for . By Dr. Livermore . What does this mean ? " " Can you prove that ? " " Of course . This note , read it for yourself . " He pinched it between the tips of his fingers and looked at it briefly before dropping it into an envelope and putting it into his pocket . His gun had vanished . " Anyone could have typed that , " he said . " You could have typed it yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about . It was on my desk when I came to work a short while ago . I read it , came here , heard the sound of glass being broken , entered . Saw this hammer and picked it up . Nothing else . " Blalock looked at her closely for a long instant , then nodded and waved her after him to the outer office . " Perhaps . We will check that out later . For the moment you will sit here quietly while I make some calls . " He had a list of numbers , and the first one he dialed rang a long time before it was answered . Leatha Crabb 's sleep-puffed face finally appeared on the screen . " What do you want ? " she asked , her eyes widening when she saw who the caller was . " Your husband . I wish to talk to him . " " He 's  --  he 's asleep . " She looked about uneasily , and Blalock did not miss the hesitation in her voice . " Is he ? Then wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? Just tell me why ? " " Then I will be there at once . Would that embarrass you , Mrs. Crabb ? Will you either wake your husband  --  or tell me the truth ? " She lowered her eyes and spoke in a small voice . " He 's not here . He has n't been here all night . " " Do you know where he is ? "  | " No . And I do n't care . We had a difference of opinion , and he stamped out . And that is all I wish to tell you . " The screen went dark . Blalock instantly dialed another number . This time there was no answer . He turned to Catherine Ruffin , who sat , still dazed by the rapid passage of events . " I want you to take me to Dr. Livermore 's office . " Still not sure what had happened , she did exactly as he asked . The door was unlocked . Blalock pushed by her and looked in . The pale early sunlight streamed in through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sniffed at the air , as though searching out a clue , then pointed to the door in the right-hand wall . " Where does this lead ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know . " " Stay here . " Catherine Ruffin disliked his tone , but before she could tell him so , he was across the room and standing to one side as he carefully opened the door . Livermore lay asleep on the couch inside , with a thin blanket pulled over him and clutched to his neck by one hand . Blalock went in silently and took him by the wrist , his forefinger inside below the base of the thumb . Livermore opened his eyes at the touch , blinked , and pulled his hand away . " What the devil are you doing here ? " " Taking your pulse . You do n't mind , do you ? " " I certainly do . " He sat up and threw the blanket aside . " I 'm the doctor here , and I do the pulse-taking . I asked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There has been more sabotage in the bottle room . I had alarms rigged . I found this woman there with a hammer . " " Catherine ! Why would you do a foolish thing like that ? " " How dare you ! You sent a note , I received it , asking me to go there , to trap me  --  perhaps you broke those bottles ! " Livermore yawned and rubbed at his eyes , then bent and groped under the couch for his shoes .  | " That 's what Dick Tracy here thinks . " He grunted as he pulled a shoe on . " Finds me sleeping here , does n't believe that , tries to take my pulse and see if I 've been running around with that hammer , faster pulse than a sleeping pulse . Idiot ! " He snapped the last word and rose to his feet . " I am in charge of this project , it 's my project . Before you accuse me of sabotaging it , you had better find a better reason than baseless suspicion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe you will have a lead . " " I fully intend to , " Blalock said , and the phone rang . " For you , " Livermore said , and passed it to the FBI man , who listened silently , then issued a sharp command . " Bring him here . " Before she left , Catherine Ruffin made a sworn statement , and it was recorded on Livermore 's office machine . Then Livermore did the same thing . Yes , he had not been in his apartment . He had worked late in his office , and as he did many times , he had slept on the couch in the adjoining room . He had gone to sleep around 0300 hours and had neither seen nor heard anything since that time , not until Blalock had wakened him . Yes , it was possible to get from the bottle room by way of the rear door , and through the business office to this office , but he had not done that . He was just finishing the statement when a stranger , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brought Gust Crabb in . Blalock dismissed the man and turned the full power of his attention on Gust . " You were not in your apartment all night . Where were you ? " " Go to hell . " " Your attitude is not appreciated . Your whereabouts are unknown  --  up to a few minutes ago when you arrived at your office . During the time in question someone broke into the bottle room and sabotaged this project with a hammer . I ask you again . Where were you ? "  | Gust , who was a simple man in all except his work , now enacted a pantomime of worry , guilt , and unhappiness complete with averted eyes and a fine beading of sweat on his forehead . Livermore felt sorry for him and turned away and harrumphed and found his tie and busied himself knotting it . " Talk , " Blalock said loudly , using all the pressure he could to increase the other 's discomfort . " It 's not what you think , " Gust said in a hollow voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest you now for willful sabotage of a government project . " The silence lengthened uncomfortably . It was Livermore who broke it . " For God 's sake , Gust , tell him . You could n't have done a thing like this . What is it  --  a girl ? " He snorted through his nose at the sudden flushing of Gust 's face . " It is . Spill it out , it wo n't go beyond this room . The government does n't care about your sex life , and I 'm well past the age where these things have much importance . " " No one 's business , " Gust muttered . " Crime is the government 's business ? " Blalock said but was cut off by Livermore . " But love affairs are n't , so will you shut up ? Tell him the truth , Gust , tell him or you 'll be in trouble . It was a girl ? " " Yes , " Gust said most reluctantly , staring down at the floor . " Good . You stayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciated , and then you will no longer be a suspect . " Under painful prodding Gust managed to mumble these details . The girl was a secretary with the engineering commission ; he had known her a long time . She liked him , but he stayed away from her until last night , a fight with Leatha , he had stamped out , found himself at Georgette 's door  --  you wo n't tell anyone ? ? and she took him in , one thing led to another . There it was . " There it is , " Livermore said . " Do your work , Blalock ,  | Gust will be here with me if you want him . Find the girl , get her story , then leave us alone . Investigate the mysterious note , take fingerprints from the hammer , and do whatever you do in this kind of thing . But leave us be . Unless you have some evidence and want to arrest me , get out of my office . " When they were alone , Livermore made some coffee in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood looking out at the hillside now shaded by clouds and curtained with rain . " You think I 'm a fool , " Gust said . " Not at all . I think there 's trouble between you and Leatha and that you 're making it worse instead of better . " " But what can I do ! " Livermore ignored the note of pleading in the man 's voice and stirred his coffee to cool it . " You know what to do without bothering me . It 's your problem . You 're an adult . Solve it . With your wife or family counseling or whatever . Right now I have something slightly more important to think about with this sabotage and the FBI and the rest of it . " Gust sat up straighter and almost smiled . " You 're right . My problem is n't that world-shaking and I 'll take care of it . Do you realize that you and I and Leatha seem to be the FBI 's prime suspects ? He must have called the apartment if he knew I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurant last night . Why us ? " " Propinquity , I imagine . We and the technicians are the only ones who go in and out of the bottle rooms at will . And one of the technicians is a plant , he told us that , so they are being watched from their own ranks . Which leaves us . " " I do n't understand it at all . Why should anyone want to sabotage the bottles ? " Livermore nodded slowly . " That 's the question that Blalock should be asking . Until he finds out the why of this business he 's never going to find who is doing it . "  | * * * Leatha came silently into the office and said nothing as she closed the door behind her . Gust looked up from the papers on his desk , surprised ; she had never been in his office before . " Why did you do it , why ? " she said in a hoarse voice , her face drawn , ugly with the strain of her emotions . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know  --  that Blalock came to see me and told me everything . Where you were last night , about her , so do n't try to deny it . He was n't lying , I could tell . " Gust was tired and not up to playing a role in a bitter exchange . " Why would he tell you these things ? " he asked . " Why ? That 's fairly obvious . He does n't care about you or me , just his job . He suspects me , I could tell that , thinks I could sabotage the bottles . He wanted me to lose my temper , and I did , not that it did any good . Now answer me  --  pigwhy did you do it ? That 's all I want to know , why ? " Gust looked at his fists clenched on the desk before him . " I wanted to , I suppose . " " You wanted to ! " Leatha shrieked the words . " That 's the kind of man you are , you wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to bother asking you what happened ? my imagination is good enough for that . " " Lea , this is n't the time or place to talk about this ? " " Oh , is n't it ? It does n't take any special place for me to tell you what I think of you , you . . . traitor ! " His fixed and silent face only angered her more , beyond words . On the table close by was a cutaway model of New Town , prepared when it was still in the design stage . She seized it in both hands , raised it over her head , and hurled it at him . But it was too light , and it spun end over end in the air , striking him harmlessly on the arm and falling to the floor where it broke , shedding small chunks of plastic . " You should n't have done that , " Gust said , bending to  | retrieve the model . " Here you 've broken it and it costs money . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slam , and he looked up to see that Leatha was gone . Anger filled her , stronger than anything she had ever experienced before in her life . Her chest hurt and she had trouble breathing . How could he have done this to her ? She walked fast , until she had to gasp for breath , through the corridors of New Town . Aimlessly , she thought , until she looked at the entrance to the nearby offices and realized that she had had a goal all the time . CENTENGCOM , the sign read , an unattractive acronym for the Central Engineering Commission . Could she enter here , and if she did , what could she say ? A man came out and held the door for her ; she could n't begin to explain why she was standing there so she went in . There was a floor plan on the facing wall , and she pressed the button labeled SECRETARIAL POOL , then turned in the indicated direction . It really proved quite easy to do . A number of girls worked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typers . People were going in and out , and she stood for a minute until a young man carrying a sheaf of papers emerged . He stopped when she spoke to him . " Could you help me ? I 'm looking for a . . . Miss Georgette Booker . I understand she works here . " " Georgy , sure . Over there at that desk against the far wall , wearing the white shirt or whatever you call it . Want me to tell her you 're here ? " " No , that 's fine , thank you very much . I 'll talk to her my-self . " Leatha waited until he had gone , then looked over the bent heads to the desk against the far wall and gasped . Yes , it had to be that girl , white blouse and dark hair , rich chocolatecolored skin . Leatha pushed on into the office and took a roundabout path through the aisles between the desks that  | would enable her to pass by the girl , slowing as she came close . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A nicely sculptured face , thin-bridged nose , but too heavily made up with the purple lipstick that was in now . And tiny silver stars dusted across one cheek and onto her chest . There was enough of that , and most of it showing too in the new peekie-look thin fabric , almost completely transparent . The large breasts rose halfway out of the blouse , and through it the black circles of her nipples could be seen . Feeling the eyes on her , Georgette looked up and smiled warmly at Leatha , who turned away and walked past her , faster and faster . By the middle of the afternoon Dr. Livermore was very tired . He had had little sleep the previous night , and the FBI man 's visit had disturbed him . Then he had to put the technicians to work clearing up the mess in the bottle room , and while they could be trusted to do a good job , he nevertheless wanted to check it out for himself when they were done . He would do that and then perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gene charts away from him and rose stiffly . He was beginning to feel his years . Perhaps it was time to consider joining his patients in the warm comfort of the geriatric levels . He smiled at the thought and started for the labs . There was little formality among his staff , and he never thought to knock on the door of Leatha 's private office when he found it closed . His thoughts were on the bottles . He pushed the door open and found her bent over the desk , her face in her hands , crying . " What is wrong ? " he called out before he realized that it might have been wiser to leave quietly . He had a sudden insight as to what the trouble might be . She raised a tear-dampened and reddened face , and he closed the door behind him .  | " I 'm sorry to walk in like this . I should have knocked . " " No , Dr. Livermore , that 's all right . " She dabbed at her eyes with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me like this . " " Perfectly normal . I think I understand . " " No , it has nothing to do with bottles . " " I know . It 's that girl , is n't it ? I had hoped you would n't find out . " Leatha was too distraught to ask him how he knew but began sobbing again at this reminder . Livermore wanted to leave but could think of no way to do it gracefully . At the present moment he just could not be interested in this domestic tragedy . " I saw her , " Leatha said . " I went there , God knows why , driven , I suppose . To see just what he preferred to me was so humiliating . A blowsy thing , vulgar , the obvious kind of thing a man might like . And she 's colored . How could he have done this .... " The sobbing began again and Livermore stopped , his hand on the knob . He had wanted to leave before he became involved himself . Now he was involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , " he said . " Where you come from . Somewhere in the South , is n't it ? " The complete irrelevancy of the question stopped Leatha , even slowed her tears . " Yes , Mississippi . A little fishing town near Biloxi . " " I thought so . And you grew up with a good jolt of racial bias . The worst thing you have against this girl is the fact that she is black . " " I never said that . But there are things ... " " No , there are not things , if you mean races or colors or religions or anything like that . I am shocked to hear you , a geneticist , even suggest an idea like that . Deeply shocked . Though , unhappily , I 'm not surprised . " " I do n't care about her . It 's him , Gust , what he did to me . " " He did nothing at all . My God , woman , you want equality  | and equal pay and freedom from childbearing  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't very well complain if you throw a man out of your bed , and he goes to someone else . " " What do you mean ? " she gasped , shocked . " I 'm sorry . It 's not my place to talk like this . I became angry . You 're an adult ; you 'll have to make your own decisions about your marriage . " " No . You ca n't leave it like that . You said something , and you 're going to tell me exactly what you meant . " Livermore was still angry . He dropped into a chair and ordered his thoughts before he spoke again . " I 'm an old-fashioned M.D. , so perhaps I had better talk from a doctor 's point of view . You 're a young woman in good health in the prime of your life . If you came to me for marriage counseling I would tell you that your marriage appears to be in trouble and you are probably the cause , the original cause , that is . Though it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal to be responsible for . It appears that in your involvement in your work , your major interests outside your marriage , you have lost your sexuality . You have no time for it . And I am not talking about sex now but all the things that make a woman feminine . The way you dress , apply makeup , carry yourself , think about yourself . Your work has come to occupy the central portion of your life , and your husband has to take second best . You must realize that some of the freedom women gained deprived the men of certain things . A married man now has no children or a mother for his children . He has no one who is primarily interested in him and his needs . I do n't insist that all marriages must exist on a master-and-slave relationship , but there should be a deal more give and take in a marriage than yours appears to offer . Just ask yourself  --  what does your husband get out of this marriage other than sexual frustration ? If it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off with a male roommate , an engineer he could talk shop with . "  | The silence lengthened , and Livermore finally coughed and cleared his throat and stood . " If I have interfered unreasonably , I 'm sorry . " He went out and saw Blalock stamping determinedly down the hall . After scowling at the man 's receding back for a moment he entered the laboratory to check the bottle installa-tions . The FBI man let himself into Catherine Ruffin 's office without knocking . She looked up at him , her face cold , then back at her work . " I 'm busy now , and I do n't wish to talk to you . " " I 've come to you for some help . " " Me ? " Her laugh had no humor in it . " You accused me of breaking those bottles , so how can you ask for aid ? " " You are the only one who can supply the information I need . If you are as innocent as you insist , you should be pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ordered mind . She had no good reason other than the fact that she disliked him  --  for refusing the man . And he was the agent officially sent here to investigate the sabotage . " What can I do ? " she asked . " Help me to uncover a motive for the crimes . " " I have no suspicions , no information that you do n't have . " " Yes , you do . You have access to all the records and to the computer  --  and you know how to program it . I want you to get all the data you can on the contents of those bottles . I have been looking at the records of losses , and there seems to be a pattern , but not one that is necessarily obvious . The fact that certain bottles were broken , three out of five , or that all the bottles in a certain rank on a certain day had their contents destroyed . There must be a key to this information in the records . "  | " This will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you all the authorization you need . " " Then I will do it . I can make the comparisons and checks and program the computer to look for relevant information . But I can not promise you that there will be the answer you seek . The destruction could be random , and if it is , this will be of no help . " " I have my own reasons for thinking that it is not random . Do this and call me as soon as you have the results . " It took two days of concentrated effort . Catherine Ruffin was very satisfied with the job that she had done . Not with the results themselves ; she could see no clues to any form of organization in any of the figures . But the federal agent might . She put in a call to him , then went through the results again until he arrived . " I can see nothing indicative , " she said , passing over the computer readouts . " That 's for me to decide . Can you explain these to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed or damaged bottles . " She handed him the top sheet . " Code number in the first column , then identification by name . " " What does that mean ? " " Surname of the donors , an easy way to remember and identify certain strains . Here , for instance , Wilson-Smith ; sperm Wilson , ovum Smith . The remaining columns are details about the selections , which traits were selected and information of that kind . Instead of the index numbers , I have used the names of the strains for identification in the processing . These are the remaining sheets which are the results of various attempts to extract meaningful relationships . I could find none . The names themselves convey more . " He looked up from the figures . " What do you mean ? " " Nothing at all . A foolish habit of my own . I am by birth a Boer , and I grew up on one of the white reservations in South Africa after the revolution . Until we emigrated here ,  | when I was eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional tie to the people  --  the ethnic group , you would call it in which I was born . It was a small group , and it is very rare to meet a Boer in this country . So I look at lists of names , an old habit , to see if I recognize any Boers among them . I have met a few people that way in my lifetime . For some talk about the old days behind barbed wire . That is what I meant . " " How does that apply to these lists ? " " There are no Boers among them . " Blalock shrugged and turned his attention back to the paper . Catherine Ruffin , born Katerina Bekink , held the list of names before her and pursed her lips over it . " No Afrikaaners at all . All of them Anglo-Irish names , if anything . " Blalock looked up sharply . " Please repeat that , " he said . She was correct . He went through the list of names twice and found only sternly Anglo-Saxon or Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the fact , uncovered by Catherine Ruffin with the name relationship as a clue , that there were no Negroes either . " It makes no sense , no sense at all , " Blalock said , shaking the papers angrily . " What possible reason could there be for this kind of deliberate action ? " " Perhaps you ask the wrong question . Instead of asking why certain names appear to be eliminated , perhaps you should ask why others do not appear on the list . Afrikaaners , for instance . " " Are there Afrikaans names on any of the bottle lists ? " " Of course . Italian names , German names , that kind of thing . " " Yes , let us ask that question , " Blalock said , bending over the lists again . It was the right question to ask .  | * * * The emergency meeting of the Genetic Guidance Council was called for 2300 hours . As always , Livermore was late . An extra chair had been placed at the foot of the big marble table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged neatly before him . Catherine Ruffin switched on the recorder and called the meeting to order when Livermore arrived . Sturtevant coughed , then grubbed out his vegetable cigarette and immediately lit another one . " Those burning compost heaps will kill you yet , " Livermore said . Catherine Ruffin interrupted the traditional disagreement before it could get under way . " This meeting has been called at the request of Mr. Blalock , of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , who is here investigating the bottle failures and apparent sabotage . He is now ready to make a report . " " About time , " Livermore said . " Find out yet who is the saboteur ? " " Yes , " Blalock said tonelessly . " You are , Dr. Livermore . " " Well , well , big talk from little man . But you 'll have to come up with some evidence before you wring a confession out of me . " " I think I can do that . Since the sabotage began and even before it was recognized as sabotage , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage is known as a tithe , which is indicative of a certain attitude or state of mind . It is also ten times the average failure ratio at other laboratories , which is normally about one percent . As further evidence the bottles sabotaged all had Irish or English surnamed donors . " Livermore sniffed loudly . " Pretty flimsy evidence . And what does it have to do with me ? " " I have here a number of transcripts of meetings of this council where you have gone on record against what you call  | discrimination in selection . You seem to have set yourself up as a protector of minorities , claiming at different times that Negroes , Jews , Italians , Indians , and other groups have been discriminated against . The records reveal that no bottles bearing names of donors belonging to any of these groups have ever been lost by apparent accident or deliberate sabotage . The connection with you seems obvious , as well as the fact that you are one of the few people with access to the bottles as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sabotage . " " Sounds more like circumstantial evidence , not facts , to me . Are you planning to bring these figures out in a public hearing or trial or whatever you call it ? " " I am . " " Then your figures will also show the unconscious and conscious discrimination that is being practiced by the geneticselection techniques now being used . Because it will reveal just how many of these minority groups do . With these facts in mind I then admit to all the acts you have accused me of . I did it all . " A shocked silence followed his words . Catherine Ruffin shook her head , trying to understand . " Why ? I do n't understand why you did it , " she said . " You still do n't know , Catherine ? I thought you were more intelligent than that . I did everything within my power to change the errant policies of this board and all the other boards throughout the country . I got exactly nowhere . With natural childbirth almost completely a thing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from the gene pool represented by the stored sperm and ova . With the selection techniques existing now , minority after minority will be eliminated . With their elimination countless genes that we simply can not lose will be lost forever . Perhaps a world of fair-  | skinned , blue-eyed , blond , and muscular Anglo-Saxon Protestants is your idea of an ideal society . It is not mine  --  nor is it very attractive to the tinted-skin people with the funny foreign ways , odd names , and strangely shaped noses . They deserve to survive just as much as we do  --  and to survive right here in their country . Which is the United States of America . So do n't tell me about Italian and Israeli gene pools in their native lands . The only real Americans here with an original claim to that name are the American Indians , and they are being dropped out of the gene pool as well . A crime is being committed . I was aware of it and could convince no one else of its existence . Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . During my coming trial these facts will be publicized , and after that the policy will have to be reexamined and changed , " " You foolish old man , " Catherine Ruffin said , but the warmth in her voice belied the harshness of her words . " You 've ruined yourself . You will be fined , you may go to jail , at the least you will be relieved of your position , forced into retirement . You will never work again . " " Catherine my dear , I did what I had to do . Retirement at my age holds no fears . In fact I have been considering it and rather looking forward to it . Leave genetics and practice medicine as a hobby with my old fossils . I doubt the courts will be too hard on me . Compulsory retirement , I imagine , no more . Well worth it to get the facts out before the public . " " In that you have failed , " Blalock said coldly , putting the papers together and dropping them into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply a dismissal , better for all concerned that way . Since you have admitted guilt , your superiors can make a decision in camera as to what to do . " " That 's not fair ! " Sturtevant said . " He only did these things to publicize what was happening . You ca n't take that away from him . It 's not fair .... " " Fair has nothing to do with it , Mr. Sturtevant . The genetic  | program will continue unchanged . " Blalock seemed almost ready to smile at the thought . Livermore looked at him with distaste . " You would like that , would n't you ? Do n't rock the boat . Get rid of disloyal employees  --  and at the same time rid this country of dissident minorities . " " You said it , Doctor , I did n't . And since you have admitted guilt , there is nothing you can do about it . " Livermore rose slowly and started from the room , turning before he reached the door . " Quite the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing . You have accused me of a crime before my associates , and I wish my name cleared , since I am innocent of all charges . " " It wo n't wash . " Blalock was smiling now . " Your statement of guilt is on tape , recorded in the minutes of this meet-ing . " " I do n't think it is . I did one final bit of sabotage earlier today . On that recorder . The tape is blank . " " That will do you no good . There are witnesses to your words . " " Are there ? My two associates on the council are two committed human beings , no matter what our differences . If what I have said is true I think they will want the facts to come out . Am I right , Catherine ? " " I never heard you admit guilt , Dr. Livermore . " " Nor I , " Sturtevant said . " I shall insist on a full departmental hearing to clear your name . " " See you in court , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought you would be at work . I did n't expect to see you here , " Gust said to Leatha , who was sitting , looking out of the window of their living room . " I just came back to pack a bag , take my things out . "  | " Do n't do that . " " I 'm sorry what happened the other night , I just ... " " We 'll talk about that some other time . " There was almost an embarrassed silence then , and he noticed her clothes for the first time . She was wearing a dress he had never seen before , a colorful print , sheer and low-cut . And her hair was different somehow , and her lipstick , more than she usually wore , he thought . She looked very nice , and he wondered if he should tell her that . " Why do n't we go out to that restaurant in Old Town , " Leatha said . " I think that might be fun . " " It will be fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unreasonably , happier than he had ever been before . Georgette Booker looked up at the clock and saw that it was almost time to quit . Good . Dave was taking her out again tonight , which meant that he would propose again . He was so sweet . She might even marry him , but not now . Life was too relaxed , too much fun , and she enjoyed people . Marriage was always there when you wanted it , but right now she just did n't want it . She smiled . She was quite happy . Sharm smiled and ate another piece of the ring-shaped roll . " Top-pit , " he said . " Really good . What is it called ? " " A bagel , " his wife said . " You 're supposed to eat them with smoked salmon and white cheese . I found it in this old cultfood book . I think they 're nice . " " I think they 're a lot better than nice . We 're going to bake a whole lot of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they got bread tastes like wet paper there . People will love them . They have to love them . Because you and I are going to move to New Town . They are going to love these  | bagels or something else we are going to sell them . Because you and I , we are going to live in that new place . " " You tell them , Sharm . " " I 'm telling them . Old Sharm is going to get his cut of that good life , too . "  | Low clouds rushed by overhead in the dusk and there was a spattering of sleet in the air . When Dr. Lanning opened the cab door of the truck the wind pounced on him . Fresh from the Arctic , hurtling unimpeded across Salisbury Plain . He buried his chin in his collar and climbed down ; Barker followed him out and tapped on the door of the office nearby . There was no answer . " Not so good , " Lanning said , opening the rear door of the truck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We do n't leave our national monuments unguarded in the States . " " Really , " Barker said , turning and striding to the gate in the wire fence . " Then I presume those initials carved in the base of the Washington Monument are neolithic graffiti . As you see I brought the key . " He unlocked the gate and threw it open with a squeal of unoiled hinges , then went to help Lanning with the case . In the evening , under a lowering sky , that is the only way to see Stonehenge . Without the ice cream wrappers and clambering children . The Plain settles flat upon the earth , pressed outward to a distant horizon , and only the gray pillars of the sarsen stones have the strength to push up skyward.  | Lanning led the way , bending into the wind , up the broad path of the Avenue . " They 're always bigger than you expect them to be , " he said , and Barker did not answer him , perhaps because it was true . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 'll know soon enough , " Lanning said , throwing open the latches . " Another theory ? " Barker asked , interested in spite of himself . " Our megaliths seem to hold a certain fascination for you and your fellow Americans . " " We tackle our problems wherever we find them , " Lanning answered , opening the cover and disclosing a chunky and complicated piece of apparatus mounted on an aluminum tripod . " I have no theories at all about these things . I 'm here just to find out the truth  --  why this thing was built . " " Admirable , " Barker said , and the coolness of his comment was lost in the colder wind . " Might I ask just what this device is ? " " Chronostasis temporal-recorder . " He opened the legs and stood the machine next to the Altar Stone . " My team at MIT worked it up . We found that temporal movement other than our usual twenty-four hours into the future every day ? is instant death for anything living . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens ; there were no human volunteers . But inanimate objects can be moved without damage . " " Time travel ? " Barker said in what he hoped was a diffident voice . " Not really , time stasis would be a better description . The machine stands still and lets everything else move by it . We 've penetrated a good ten thousand years into the past this way . " " If the machine stands still that means that time is running backwards ? " " Perhaps it is  --  would you be able to tell the difference ? Here , I think we 're ready to go now . " Lanning adjusted the controls on the side of the machine ,  | pressed a stud , then stepped back . A rapid whirring came from the depths of the device : Barker raised one quizzical eyebrow . " A timer , " Lanning explained . " It 's not safe to be close to the thing when it 's operating . " The whirring ceased and was followed by a sharp click , immediately after which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lanning said , and the machine reappeared even as he spoke . A glossy photograph dropped from a slot into his hand when he touched the back . He showed it to Barker . " Just a trial run . I sent it back twenty minutes . " Although the camera had been pointing at them , the two men were not in the picture . Instead , in darkish pastels due to the failing light , the photograph showed a view down the Avenue , with their parked truck just a tiny square in the distance . From the rear doors of the vehicle the two men could be seen removing the yellow box . " That 's very . . . impressive , " Barker said , shocked into admission of the truth . " How far back can you send it ? " " Seems to be no limit , just depends on the power source . This model has nicad batteries and is good back to about ten thousand B.C. " " And the future ? " " A closed book , I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He extracted a small notebook from his hip pocket and consulted it , then set the dials once again . " These are the optimum dates , about the time we figure Stonehenge was built . I 'm making this a multiple-shot . This lever records the setting , so now I can feed in another one . " There were over twenty settings to be made , which necessitated a great deal of dial spinning . When it was finally done , Lanning actuated the timer and went to join Barker . This time the departure of the chronostasis temporal-recorder was much more dramatic . It vanished readily enough ,  | but left a glowing replica of itself behind , a shimmering golden outline easily visible in the growing darkness . " Is that normal ? " Barker asked . " Yes , but only on the big time jumps . No one is really sure just what it is , but we call it a temporal echo . The current theory that it is sort of a resonance in time caused by the sudden departure of the machine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the golden glow was completely gone the device itself returned , appearing solidly in place of its spectral echo . Lanning rubbed his hands together , then pressed the print button . The machine clattered in response and extruded a long strip of connected prints . " Not as good as I expected , " Lanning said . " We hit the daytime all right , but there is nothing much going on . " There was enough going on to almost stop Barker 's archeologist heart . Picture after picture of the megalith standing strong and complete , the menhirs upright and the lintels in place upon all the sarsen stones . " Lots of rock , " Lanning said , " but no sign of the people who built the thing . Looks like the dating theories are wrong . Do you have any idea when it was put up ? " " Sir J. Norman Lockyer believed that it was erected on June 24th , 1680 B.C. , " he said abstractedly , still petrified by the photographs . " Sounds good to me . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture this time was far more dramatic . A group of men in rough homespun genuflected , arms outstretched , facing toward the camera . " We 've got it now , " Lanning chortled , and spun the machine about in a half circle so it faced in the opposite direction . " Whatever they 're worshiping is behind the camera . I 'll take a shot of it and we 'll have a good idea why they built this thing . "  | The second picture was almost identical to the first , as were two more taken at right angles to the first ones . " This is crazy , " Lanning said , " they 're all facing into the camera and bowing . Why , the machine must be sitting on top of whatever they are looking at . " " No , the angle proves that the tripod is on the same level that they are . " Sudden realization hit Barker and his jaw sagged . " Is it possible that your temporal echo could be visible in the past as well ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why not . Do you mean . . . ? " " Correct . The golden glow of the machine caused by all those stops must have been visible on and off for years . It gave me a jolt when I first saw it and it must have been much more impressive to the people then . " " It fits , " Lanning said , smiling happily and beginning to repack the machine . " They built Stonehenge around the image of the device sent back to see why they built Stonehenge . That 's one problem solved . " " Solved ! The problem has just begun . It 's a paradox . Which of them , the machine or the monument , came first ? " Slowly , the smile faded from Dr. Lanning 's face .  | Pull ! Pull steadily ... ! " Dragomir shouted , clutching at the tarry cords of the net . Beside him in the hot darkness Pribislav Polasek grunted as he heaved on the wet strands . The net was invisible in the black water , but the blue light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's slipping . . . " Pribislav groaned and clutched the rough gunwale of the little boat . For a single instant he could see the blue light on the helmet , a faceplate and the suited body that faded into blackness  --  then it slipped free of the net . He had just a glimpse of a dark shape before it was gone . " Did you see it ? " he asked . " Just before he fell he waved his hand . " " How can I know the hand moved , it could have been the net , or he might still be alive ? " Dragomir had his face bent almost to the glassy surface of the water , but there was nothing more to be seen . " He might be alive . " The two fishermen sat back in the boat and stared at each other in the harsh light of the hissing acetylene lamp in the bow . They were very different men , yet greatly alike in their stained , baggy trousers and faded cotton shirts . Their hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , their thoughts slowed by the rhythm of work and years .  | " We can not get him up with the net , " Dragomir finally said , speaking first as always . " Then we will need help , " Pribislav added . " We have anchored the buoy here , we can find the spot again . " " Yes , we need help . " Dragomir opened and closed his large hands , then leaned over to bring the rest of the net into the boat . " The diver , the one who stays with the widow Korenc , he will know what to do . His name is Kukovic and Petar said that he is a doctor of science from the university in Ljubljana . " They bent to their oars and sent the heavy boat steadily over the glasslike water of the Adriatic . Before they had reached shore , the sky was light and when they tied to the sea wall in Brbinj the sun was above the horizon . Joze Kukovic looked at the rising ball of the sun , already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The widow shuffled out with his coffee , mumbled good morning , and put it on the stone rail of the porch . He pushed the tray aside and sat down next to it , then emptied the coffee from the small , long-handled pot into his cup . The thick Turkish coffee would wake him up , in spite of the impossible hour . From the rail he had a view down the unpaved and dusty street to the port , already stirring to life . Two women , with the morning 's water in brass pots balanced on their heads , stopped to talk . The peasants were bringing in their produce for the morning market , baskets of cabbages and potatoes and trays of tomatoes , strapped onto tiny donkeys . One of them brayed , a harsh noise that sawed through the stillness of the morning , bouncing echoes from the yellowed buildings . It was hot already . Brbinj was a town at the edge of nowhere , located between empty ocean and barren hills , asleep for centuries and dying by degrees . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . But under the flat , blue calm of the water was another world that Joze loved .  | Cool shadows , deep valleys , more alive than all the sunblasted shores that surrounded it . Excitement , too : just the day before , too late in the afternoon to really explore it , he had found a Roman galley half-buried in the sand . He would get into it today , the first human in two thousand years , and Heaven alone knew what he would find there . In the sand about it had been shards of broken amphorae ; there might be whole ones inside the hull . Sipping happily at his coffee , he watched the small boat tying up in the harbor , and wondered why the two fishermen were in such a hurry . They were almost running , and no one ran here in the summer . Stopping below his porch , the biggest one called up to him . " Doctor , may we come up ? There is something urgent . " " Yes , of course . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician . Dragomir shuffled forward and did not know where to begin . He pointed out over the ocean . " It fell , out there last night , we saw it , a sputnik without a doubt ? " " A traveler ? " Joze Kukovic wrinkled his forehead , not quite sure that he heard right . When the locals were excited it was hard to follow their dialect . For such a small country Yugoslavia was cursed with a multitude of tongues . " No , it was not a putnik , but a sputnik , one of the Russian spaceships . " " Or an American one . " Pribislav spoke for the first time , but he was ignored . Joze smiled and sipped his coffee . " Are you sure it was n't a meteorite you saw ? There is always a heavy meteor shower this time of the year . " " A sputnik , " Dragomir insisted stolidly . " The ship fell far out in the Jadransko More and vanished , we saw that . But the space pilot came down almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " The WHAT ? " Joze gasped , jumping to his feet and knocking the coffee tray to the floor . The brass tray clanged and rattled in circles unnoticed . " There was a man in this thing ? and he got clear ? " Both fishermen nodded at the same time and Dragomir continued . " We saw this light fall from the sputnik when it went overhead and drop into the water . We could n't see what it was , just a light , and we rowed there as fast as we could . It was still sinking and we dropped a net and managed to catch him .... " " You have the pilot ? " " No , but once we pulled him close enough to the surface to see that he was in a heavy suit , with a window like a diving suit , and there was something on the back that might have been like your tanks there . " " He waved his hand , " Pribislav insisted . " He might have waved a hand , we could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The silence lengthened and Joze realized that he was the help that they needed , and that they had turned the responsibility over to him . What should he do first ? The astronaut might have his own oxygen tanks , Joze had no real idea what provisions were made for water landings , but if there was oxygen the man might still be alive . Joze paced the floor while he thought , a short , square figure in khaki shorts and sandals . He was not handsome , his nose was too big and his teeth were too obvious for that , but he generated a certainty of power . He stopped and pointed to Pribislay . " We 're going to have to get him out . You can find the spot again ? " " A buoy . " " Good . And we may need a doctor . You have none here , but is there one in Osor ? " " Dr. Bratos , but he is very old .... "  | " As long as he is still alive , we 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobile ? " The fishermen looked toward the roof and concentrated , while Joze controlled his impatience . " Yes , I think so , " Dragomir finally said . " Petar was a parti-san . " " That 's right . " The other fisherman finished the thought . " He has told many times how they stole German trucks and how he drove ... " " Well , then one of you get this Petar and give him the keys to my car , it 's a German car so he should be able to manage . Tell him to bring the doctor back at once . " Dragomir took the keys , but handed them to Pribislav , who ran out . " Now let 's see if we can get the man up , " Joze said , grabbing his scuba gear and leading the way toward the boat . They rowed , side by side though Dragomir 's powerful stroke did most of the work . " How deep is the water out here ? " Joze asked . He was already dripping with sweat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper up by Rab , but we were fishing off Trstenilc and the bottom is only about four fathoms there . We 're coming to the buoy . " " Seven meters , it should n't be too hard to find him . " Joze kneeled in the bottom of the boat and slipped into the straps of the scuba . He buckled it tight , checked the valves , then turned to the fisherman before he bit into the mouthpiece . " Keep the boat near this buoy and I 'll use it for a guide while I search . If I need a line or any help , I 'll surface over the astronaut , then you can bring the boat to me . " He turned on the oxygen and dipped over the side , the cool water rising up his body as he sank below the surface . With a powerful kick he started toward the bottom , following the dropping line of the buoy rope . Almost at once he saw the man , spread-eagled on white sand below .  | Joze swam down , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Details were clearer as he dropped lower . There were no identifying marks on the pressure suit ; it might be either American or Russian . It was a hard suit , metal or reinforced plastic , and painted green , with a single , flat faceplate in the helmet . Because distance and size are so deceptive underwater , Joze was on the sand next to the figure before he realized that it was less than four feet long . He gasped and almost lost his mouth-piece . Then he looked at the faceplate and saw that the creature inside was not human . Joze coughed a bit and blew out a stream of bubbles : he had been holding his breath without realizing it . He just floated there , paddling slowly with his hands to stay in a position , looking at the face within the helmet . It was still as a waxen cast , green wax with roughened surface , slit nostrils , slit mouth , and large eyeballs unseen but prominent as they pushed up against the closed lids . The arrangement of features was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color or had a pulpy crest , partially visible through the faceplate , growing up from above the closed eyes . Joze stared down at the suit made up of some unknown material , and at the compact atmosphere-regeneration apparatus on the alien 's back . What kind of atmosphere ? He looked back at the creature and saw that the eyes were open and the thing was watching him . Fear was his first reaction ; he shot back in the water like a startled fish , then , angry at himself , came forward again . The alien slowly raised one arm , then dropped it limply . Joze looked through the faceplate and saw that the eyes were closed again . The alien was alive , but unable to move ; perhaps it was injured and in pain . The wreck of the creature 's ship showed that something had been wrong with the landing . Reaching under as gently as he could , he cradled the tiny body in his  | arms , trying to ignore a feeling of revulsion when the cold fabric of the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal or plastic , he had to be a scientist about this . When he lifted it up , the eyes still did not open , and he bore the limp and almost weightless form to the surface . " You great stupid clumsy clod of peasant , help me , " he shouted , spitting out his mouthpiece and treading water on the surface , but Dragomir only shook his head in horror and retreated to the point of the bow when he saw what the physicist had borne up from below . " It is a creature from another world and can not harm you ! " Joze insisted , but the fisherman would not approach . Joze cursed aloud and only managed with great difficulty to get the alien into the boat , then climbed in after him . Though he was twice Joze 's size , threats of violence drove Dragomir to the oars . But he used the farthest set of tholepins , even though it made rowing much more difficult . Joze dropped his scuba gear into the bottom of the boat and looked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His fear of the unknown was forgiven in his growing enthusiasm . He was a nuclear physicist but he remembered enough of his chemistry and mechanics to know that this material was completely impossible  --  by Earth 's standards . Light green , it was as hard as steel over the creature 's limbs and torso , yet was soft and bent easily at the joints as he proved by lifting and dropping the limp arm . His eyes went down the alien 's tiny figure : there was a thick harness about the middle , roughly where a human waist would be , and hanging from this was a bulky container , like an oversize sporran . The suiting continued without an apparent seam but the right leg ! It was squeezed in and crushed as though it had been grabbed by a giant pliers . Perhaps this explained the creature 's lack of motion . Could it be hurt ? In pain ? Its eyes were open again and Joze realized in sudden horror that the helmet was filled with water . It must have leaked in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet , seeing if it would screw off , tugging at it in panic . Then he forced himself to think , and shakingly let go . The alien was still quiet , eyes open , no bubbles apparently coming from lips or nose . Did it breathe ? Had the water leaked in  --  or was it possible it had always been there ? Was it water ? Who knew what alien atmosphere it might breathe ; methane , chlorine , sulfur dioxide  --  why not water ? The liquid was inside , surely enough , the suit was n't leaking and the creature seemed unchanged . Joze looked up and saw that Dragomir 's panicked strokes had brought them into the harbor . A crowd was waiting on the shore . The boat almost overturned as Dragomir leaped up onto the harbor wall , kicking backward in his panic . They drifted away and Joze picked the mooring line up from the floorboards and coiled it in his hands . " Here , " he shouted , " catch this . Tie it onto the ring there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not want to admit it . They stared down at the green-cased figure lying in the stern sheets , and a rustle of whispering blew across them like wind among pine boughs . The women clutched their hands to their breasts , crossing themselves . " Catch this ! " Joze said through clenched teeth , forcing himself to keep his temper . He hurled the rope onto the stones and they shied away from it . Then a youth grabbed it and slowly threaded it through the rusty ring , hands shaking and head tilted to one side , his mouth dropped in a permanent gape . He was feebleminded , too simple to understand what was going on : he simply obeyed the shouted order . " Help me get this thing ashore , " Joze called out , and even before the words were out of his mouth he realized the futility of the request . The peasants shuffled backward , a blank-faced mob sharing  | the same fear of the unknown , the women like giant , staring dolls in their knee-length flaring skirts , black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it himself . Balancing in the rocking boat , he cradled the alien in his arms and lifted it carefully up onto the rough stone of the harbor wall . The circle of watchers pushed back even farther , some of the women choking off screams and running back to their houses , while the men muttered louder : Joze ignored them . These people were going to be no help to him  --  and they might cause trouble . His own room would be safest : he doubted if they would bother him there . He had just picked up the alien when a newcomer pushed through the watchers . " There  --  what is that ? A vrag ! " The old priest pointed in horror at the alien in Joze 's arms and backed away , fumbling for his crucifix . " Enough of your superstition ! " Joze snapped . " This is no devil but a sentient creature , a traveler . Now get out of my way . " He pushed forward and they fled before him . Joze moved as quickly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind . There was a slapping of quick footsteps and he looked over his shoulder ; it was the priest , Father Perc . His stained cassock flapped and his breath whistled in his throat with the unaccustomed exertion . " Tell me , what are you doing . . . Dr. Kukovic ? What is that . . . thing ? Tell me .... " " I told you . A traveler . Two of the local fishermen saw something come from the sky and crash . This . . . alien came from it . " Joze spoke as calmly as possible . There might be trouble with the people , but not if the priest were on his side . " It is a creature from another world , a water-breathing animal , and it 's hurt . We must help it . " Father Perc scrambled along sideways as he looked with obvious distaste at the motionless alien . " It is wrong , " he mumbled , " this is something unclean , zao duh .... "  | " Neither demon nor devil , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility of creatures from other planets  --  the Jesuits even argue about it  --  so why ca n't you ? Even the Pope believes there is life on other worlds . " " Does he ? Does he ? " the old man asked , blinking with red-rimmed eyes . Joze brushed by him and up the steps to the widow Korenc 's house . She was nowhere in sight as he went into his room and gently lowered the still-unconscious form of the alien onto his bed . The priest stopped in the doorway , quivering fingers on his rosary , uncertain . Joze stood over the bed , opening and closing his hands , just as unsure . What could he do ? The creature was wounded , perhaps dying , something must be done . But what ? The distant droning whine of a car 's engine pushed into the hot room and he almost sighed with relief . It was his car , he recognized the sound , and it would be bringing the doctor . The car stopped outside and the doors slammed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the townspeople must be talking to the doctor , telling him what had happened . A slow minute passed and Joze started from the room , but stopped before he passed the priest , still standing just inside the door . What was keeping them ? His window faced on an alleyway and he could not see the street in front of the building . Then the outside door opened and he could hear the widow 's whispered voice , " In there , straight through . " There were two men , both dusty from the road . One was obviously the doctor , a short and dumpy man clutching a worn black bag , his bald head beaded with sweat . Next to him was a man , tanned and windburned , dressed like the other fisherman : this must be Petar the ex-partisan . It was Petar who went to the bed first ; the doctor just stood clutching his bag and blinking about the room . " What is this thing ? " Petar asked , then bent over , hands on  | his knees , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it sure is ugly . " " I do n't know . It 's from another planet , that 's the only thing I know . Now move aside so the doctor can look . " Joze waved and the doctor moved reluctantly forward . " You must be Dr. Bratos . I 'm Kukovic , professor of nuclear physics at the university in Ljubljana . " Perhaps waving around a little prestige might get this man 's reluctant cooperation . " Yes , how do you do . Very pleased to meet you , Professor , an honor I assure you . But what it is you wish me to do , I do not understand ? " He shook ever so lightly as he spoke and Joze realized that the man was very old , well into his eighties or more . He would have to be patient . " This alien . . . whatever it is . . . is injured and unconscious . We must do what we can to save its life . " " But what can we do ? The thing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with water  --  I am a doctor , a medical man , but not for animals , creatures like that . " " Neither am I , Doctor . No one on Earth is . But we must do our best . We must get the suit off the alien and then discover what we can do to help . " " It is impossible ! The fluid inside of it , it will run out . " " Obviously , so we will have to take precautions . We will have to determine what the liquid is , then get more of it and fill the bathtub in the next room . I have been looking at the suit and the helmet seems to be a separate piece , clamped into position . If we loosen the clamps we should be able to get a sample . " For precious seconds Dr. Bratos stood there , nibbling at his lip , before he spoke . " Yes I suppose we could , but what could we catch the sample in ? This is most difficult and irregular . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sample in , " Joze snapped , frustration pushing at his carefully held control . He turned to Petar , who was standing silently by ,  | smoking a cigarette in his cupped hand . " Will you help ? Get a soup plate , anything from the kitchen . " Petar simply nodded and left . There were muffled complaints from the widow , but he was back quickly with her best pot . " That 's good , " Joze said , lifting the alien 's head , " now slide it under here . " With the pot in position he twisted one of the clamps ; it snapped open but nothing else happened . A hairline opening was visible at the junction , but it stayed dry . But when Joze opened the second clamp there was a sudden gush of clear liquid under pressure , and before he fumbled the clamp shut again the pot was half full . He lifted the alien again and , without being told , Petar pulled the pot free and put it on the table by the window . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outside of the container . " Warm not hot , about one hundred twenty degrees I would guess . A hot ocean on a hot planet . " " But . . . is it water ? " Dr. Bratos asked haltingly . " I suppose it is  --  but are n't you the one to find out ? Is it fresh water or seawater ? " " I 'm no chemist . . . . How can I tell ? . . . It is very compli-cated . " Petar laughed and took Joze 's water glass from the nightstand . " That 's not so hard to find out , " he said , and dipped it into the pot . He raised the half-filled glass , sniffed at it , then took a sip and puckered his lips . " Tastes like ordinary seawater to me , but there 's another taste , sort of bitter . " Joze took the glass from him . " This could be dangerous , " the doctor protested , but they ignored him . Yes , salt water , hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes like more than a trace of iodine . Can you test for the presence of iodine , Doctor ? " " Here . . . no , it is quite complicated . In the laboratory with the correct equipment ? " His voice trailed off as he opened his  | bag on the table and groped through it . He brought his hand out empty . " In the laboratory . " " We have no laboratory or any other assistance , Doctor . We will have to be satisfied with what we have here , ordinary seawater will have to do . " " I 'll get a bucket and fill the tub , " Petar said . " Good . But do n't fill the bathtub yet . Bring the water into the kitchen and we 'll heat it , then pour it in . " " Right . " Petar brushed past the silent and staring priest and was gone . Joze looked at Father Perc and thought of the people of the village . " Stay here , Doctor , " he said . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than you should come near . Just sit by him . " " Yes , of course , that is correct , " Dr. Bratos said relieved , pulling the chair over and sitting down . The breakfast fire was still burning in the big stove and flamed up when Joze slid in more sticks . On the wall hung the big copper washtub and he dropped it onto the stove with a clang . Behind him the widow 's bedroom door opened , but slammed shut again when he turned . Petar came in with a bucket of water and poured it into the tub . " What are the people doing ? " Joze asked . " Just milling about and bothering each other . They wo n't be any trouble . If you 're worried about them , I can drive back to Osor and bring the police . Or telephone someone . " " No , I should have thought of that earlier . Right now I need you here . You 're the only one who is n't either senile or ignorant . " Petar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The bathtub was small and the washtub big . When the heated water was dumped in it filled it more than halfway , enough to cover the small alien . There was a drain from the bathtub but no faucets : it was usually filled with a hose from the sink . Joze picked up the alien , cradling it like a child in his  | arms , and carried it into the bath . The eyes were open again , following his every movement , but making no protest . He lowered the creature gently into the water , then straightened a moment and took a deep breath . " Helmet first , then we 'll try to figure out how the suit opens . " He bent and slowly twisted the clamps . With all four clamps open the helmet moved freely . He opened it a wide crack , ready to close it quickly if there were any signs of trouble . The ocean water would be flowing in now , mixing with the alien water , yet the creature made no complaint . After a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head with one hand so that it would not bump to the bottom of the tub . Once the helmet was clear the pulpy crest above the eyes sprang up like a coxcomb , reaching up over the top of the green head . A wire ran from the helmet to a shiny bit of metal on one side of the creature 's skull . There was an indentation there and Joze slowly pulled a metal plug out , perhaps an earphone of some kind . The alien was opening and closing its mouth , giving a glimpse of bony yellow ridges inside , and a very low humming could be heard . Petar pressed his ear against the outside of the metal tube . " The thing is talking or something , I can hear it . " " Let me have your stethoscope , Doctor , " Joze said , but when the doctor did not move he dug it from the bag himself . Yes  --  when he pressed it to the metal he could hear a rising and falling whine , speech of a kind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , handing the stethoscope back to the doctor , who took it automatically . " We had better try to get the suit off . " There were no seams or fastenings visible , nor could Joze find anything when he ran his fingers over the smooth surface . The alien must have understood what they were doing because it jerkingly raised one hand and fumbled at the metal sealing ring about the collar . With a liquid motion the suit split open  | down the front ; the opening bifurcated and ran down each leg . There was a sudden welling of blue liquid from the injured leg . Joze had a quick glimpse of green flesh , strange organs , then he spun about . " Quick , Doctor  --  your bag . The creature is hurt , that fluid might be blood , we have to help it . " " What can I do ? " Dr. Bratos said , unmoving . " Drugs , an-tiseptics  --  I might kill it  --  we know nothing of its body chemis-try . " Then do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injury , you can bind it up , stop the bleeding , ca n't you ? " " Of course , of course , " the old man said , and at last his hands had familiar things to do , extracting bandages and sterile gauze from his bag , tape and scissors . Joze reached into the warm and now murky water and forced himself to reach under the green leg and grasp the hot , green flesh . It was strange  --  but not terrible . He lifted the limb free of the water and they saw a crushed gap oozing a thick blue fluid . Petar turned away , but the doctor put on a pad of gauze and tightened the bandages about it . The alien was fumbling at the discarded suit beside it in the tub , twisting its leg in Joze 's grip . He looked down and saw it take something from the sporran container . Its mouth was moving again , he could hear the dim buzz of its voice . " What is it ? What do you want ? " Joze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now with both hands : it appeared to be a book of some kind . It might be a book , it might be anything . Yet it was covered in a shiny substance with dark markings on it , and at the edge seemed to be made of many sheets bound together . It could be a book . The leg was twisting now in Joze 's grasp and the alien 's mouth was open wider , as if it were shouting . " The bandage will get wet if we put it back into the water , " the doctor said . " Ca n't you wrap adhesive tape over it , seal it in ? "  | " In my bag  --  I 'll need some more . " While they talked the alien began to rock back and forth , splashing water from the tub , pulling its leg from Joze 's grasp . It still held the book in one thin , multi-fingered hand , but with the other one it began to tear at the bandages on its leg . " It 's hurting itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor said , recoiling from the tub . Joze snatched a piece of wrapping paper from the floor . " You fool ! You incredible fool ! " he shouted . " These compresses you used they 're impregnated with sulfanilamide . " " I always use them , they 're the best , American , they prevent wound infection . " Joze pushed him aside and plunged his arms into the tub to tear the bandages free , but the alien reared up out of his grasp sitting up above the water , its mouth gaping wide . Its eyes were open and daring and Joze recoiled as a stream of water shot from its mouth . There was a gargling sound as the water died to a trickle , and then , as the first air touched the vocal cords , a rising howling scream of pain . It echoed from the plaster ceiling , an inhuman agony as the creature threw its arms wide , then fell face forward into the water . It did not move again and , without examining it , Joze knew it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tub , still grasping the book . Slowly the fingers loosened , and while Joze looked on numbly , unable to move , the book thudded to the floor . " Help me , " Petar said , and Joze turned to see that the doctor had fallen and Petar was kneeling over him . " He fainted , or a heart attack . What can we do ? " His anger was forgotten as Joze kneeled . The doctor seemed to be breathing regularly and his face was n't flushed , so perhaps it was only a fainting spell . The eyelids fluttered . The priest brushed by and looked down over Joze 's shoulder . Dr. Bratos opened his eyes , looking back and forth at the faces bent over him . " I 'm sorry , " he said thickly ; then the eyes closed again as if to escape the sight of them .  | Joze stood and found that he was trembling . The priest was gone . Was it all over ? Perhaps they might never have saved the alien , but they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet spot on the floor and realized the book was gone . " Father Pere ! " he shouted , crying it out like an insult . The man had taken the book , the priceless book ! Joze ran out into the hall and saw the priest coming from the kitchen . His hands were empty . With sudden fear Joze knew what the old man had done and brushed past him into the kitchen and ran to the stove , hurling open the door . There , among the burning wood , lay the book . It was steaming , almost smoking as it dried , lying open . It was obviously a book ; there were marks on the pages of some kind . He turned to grab up the shovel and behind him the fire exploded , sending a white flame across the room . It had almost caught him in the face , but he did not think of that . Pieces of burning wood lay on the floor , and inside the stove there was only the remains of the original fire . Whatever substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had dried out . " It was evil , " the priest said from the doorway . " A zao duh , an abomination with a book of evil . We have been warned , such things have happened before on Earth , and always the faithful must fight back " Petar pushed in roughly past him and helped Joze to a chair , brushing the hot embers from his bare skin . Joze had not felt their burn ; all he was aware of was an immense weariness . " Why here ? " he asked . " Of all places in the world why here ? A few more degrees to the west and the creature would have come down near Trieste with surgeons , hospitals , modern facilities . Or , if it had just stayed on its course a little longer , it could have seen the lights , and would have landed at Rijeka . Something could have been done . But why here ? " He surged to his feet , shaking his fist at nothing  --  and at everything . " Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What kind of world do we live in where there is STAINLESS STEEL VISIONS 173  | a five-million-volt electron accelerator not a hundred miles from primitive stupidity ? That this creature should come so far , come so close . . . why , why ? " Why ? He slumped back into the chair again , f ng older than he had ever felt before and tired beyond m ure . What could they have learned from this book ? He sighed , and the sigh came from so deep within him that his whole body trembled as though shaken by awful fever .  | 11 A.M. ! ! ! the note blared at him , pinned to the upper right corner of his drawing board . MAR-TIN 'S OFFICE ! ! He had lettered it himself with a number 7 brush . Funereal India ink on harsh yellow paper , big letters , big words . Big end to everything . Pachs tried to make himself believe that this was just another one of Martin 's royal commands : a lecture , a chewing-out , a complaint . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this reminder for himself , before Miss Fink 's large watery eyes had blinked at him as she had whispered hoarsely . " It 's on order , Mr. Pachs , coming today . I saw the receipt on his desk . A Mark Nine . " She had blinked moistly again , rolled her eyes toward the closed door of Martin 's office , then scurried away . A Mark IX . He knew that it would have to come someday , knew without wanting to admit it . He had only been kidding himself when he said that they could n't do without him . His hands spread out on the board before him , old hands , networked wrinkles and dark liver spots . Always stained a bit with ink and marked with a permanent callus on the inside of his index finger . How many years had he held a pencil , or a  | brush there ? He closed his hands into fists when he saw that they were shaking . There was almost an hour left before he had to see Martin , plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pulled the sheet of illustration board from the top of the pile and found the script . Page three of a piece of crap called " Prairie Love . " For the July issue of Real Rangeland Romances . Love books with their heavy copy were always a snap . By the time Miss Fink had typed in the endless captions and dialogue on her big flatbed varityper at least half of every panel was full . He picked up the script , read panel one : In house , Judy C/U cries and Robert in BG very angry . A size-three head for Judy in the foreground  --  he quickly drew the right size oval in blue pencil then a stick figure for Robert in the background . Hand raised , fist closed , to show anger . The Mark VIII Robot Comic Artist would do all the rest . Pachs slipped the sheet of illustration board into the machine 's holder  --  then quickly pulled it out again . He had forgotten the balloons . Sloppy , sloppy . He quickly blue-penciled their outlines and Vs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hummed to life , the operating lights came on , there was a dee-buzzing from inside its dark case . He punched the control button for the heads , first the girl  --  GIRL HEAD , FULL FRONT , SIZE THREE , SAD HEROINE . Girls , of course , all had the same face in comic books ; the HEROINE was just a note to the machine not to touch the hair . For a VILLAINESS it would be inked in black since all villainesses have black hair . Just as all villains have mustaches as well as the black hair , to distinguish them from the hero . The machine buzzed and clattered to itself while it sorted through the stock cuts , then clicked and banged down a rubber stamp of the correct head over the blue circle he had  | drawn . MAN HEAD , FULL FRONT , SIZE SIX , SAD , HERO brought a smaller stamp banging down on the other circle that topped the stick figure . Of course the script said angry , but that was what the raised fist was for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Life is n't that simple , he thought to himself , a very unoriginal idea that he usually brought out at least once a day while sitting at the machine . MAN FIGURE , BUSINESS SUIT , he set on the dial , then hit the DRAW button . The pen-tipped arm dropped instantly and began to quickly ink in a suited man 's figure over the blue direction lines he had put down . He blinked and watched it industriously knocking in a wrinkle pattern that had n't varied a stroke in fifty years , then a collar and tie and two swift neck lines to connect the neatly inked torso to the rubber-stamped head . The pen leaped out to the cuff end of the just-drawn sleeve and quivered there . A relay buzzed and a dusty red panel flashed INSTRUCTIONS PLEASE at him . With a savage jab he pushed the button labeled FIST . The light went out and the flashing pen drew a neat fist at the end of the arm . Pachs looked at the neatly drawn panel and sighed . The girl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inkpot and knocked in two tears , one in the corner of each eye . Better . But the background was still pretty empty in spite of the small dictionary in each balloon . BALLOONS , he punched automatically while he thought , and the machine pen darted down and inked the outlines of the balloons that held the lettering , ending each tail the correct distance from the speaker 's mouth . A little background , it needed a touch . He pressed code 473 , which he knew from long experience stood for HOME WINDOW WITH LACE CURTAINS . It appeared on the paper quickly , automatically scaled by the machine to be in perspective with the man 's figure before it . Pachs picked up the script and read panel two :  | Judy falls on couch Robert tries to console her mother rushes in angrily wearing apron . There was a four-line caption in this panel and , after the three balloons had been lettered as well , the total space remaining was just about big enough for a single close-up , a small one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have , but took the standard way out . He was feeling tired today , very tired . HOUSE , SMALL FAMILY produced a tiny cottage from which emerged the tails of the three balloons . Let the damn reader figure out who was talking . The story was finished just before eleven . He stacked the pages neatly , put the script into the file , and cleaned the ink out of the pen in the Mark VIII ; it always clogged if he left it to dry . Then it was eleven and time to see Martin . Pachs fussed a bit , rolling down his sleeves and hanging his green eyeshade from the arm of his dazor lamp ; yet the moment could not be avoided . Pulling his shoulders back a bit he went out past Miss Fink , hammering away industriously on the varityper , and walked in through the open door to Martin 's voice . " Come ON , Louis , " Martin wheedled into the phone in his most syrupy voice . " If it 's a matter of taking the word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking my word , who you gon na doubt ? That 's right . . . okay . . . right Louis . I 'll call you back in the morning . . . right , you too ... my best to Helen . " He banged the phone back onto the desk and glared up at Pachs with his hard beebee eyes . " What do you want ? " " You told me you wanted to see me , Mr. Martin . " " Yeah , yeah , " Martin mumbled half to himself . He scratched flakes of dandruff loose from the back of his head with the chewed end of a pencil , rocked from side to side in his chair .  | " Business is business , Pachs , you know that , and expenses go up all the time . Paper  --  you know how much it costs a ton ? So we got ta cut corners .... " " If you 're thinking of cutting my salary again , Mr. Martin , I do n't think I could . . . well , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let you go , Pachs . I 've bought a Mark Nine to cut expenses and I already hired some kid to run it . " " You do n't have to do that , Mr. Martin , " Pachs said hurriedly , aware that his words were tumbling one over the other and that he was pleading , but not caring . " I could run the machine I 'm sure , just give me a few days to catch on .... " " Outta the question . In the first place I 'm paying the kid beans because she 's just a kid and that 's the starting salary , and in the other place she 's been to school about this thing and can really grind the stuff out . You know I 'm no bastard , Pachs , but business is business . And I 'll tell you what , this is only Tuesday , still I 'm gon na pay you for the rest of the week . How 's that ? And you can take off right now . " " Very generous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice to be calm . " That 's all right , it 's the least I could do . " Martin was congenitally immune to sarcasm . The lost feeling hit Pachs then , a dropping away of his stomach , a sensation that everything was over . Martin was back on the phone again and there was really nothing that Pachs could say . He walked out of the office , walking very straight , and behind him he heard the banging of Miss Fink 's machine halt for an instant . He did not want to see her , to face those tender and damp eyes , not now . Instead of turning to go back to the studio , where he would have to pass her desk , he opened the hall door and stepped out . He closed it slowly behind him and stood with his back to it for an instant , until he realized it was frosted glass and she could see his figure from the inside : he moved hurriedly away . There was a cheap bar around the corner where he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . " Good morning and top of the morning to you . . . Mr. Pachs , " the robot tender greeted him with recorded Celtic charm , hesitating ghtly between the stock phrase and the search of the cus-tomer-tapes for his name . " And will you be having the usual ? " " No I will not be having the usual , you plastic-and-gas-pipe imitation of a cheap stage Irishman . I 'll be having a double whiskey . " " Sure and you are the card , sir . " The electronically affable bartender nodded , horsehair spit curl bobbing , as it produced a glass and bottle and poured a carefully measured drink . Pachs drank it in a gulp and the unaccustomed warmth burned through the core of cold indifference that he had been holding on to . Christ , it was all over , all over . They would get him now with their Senior Citizens ' Home and all the rest , he was good as dead . There are some things that do n't bear thinking about . This was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for this was no longer important because he would be earning no more after this week . The unusual dose of alcohol blurred some of the pain . Now , before he started thinking about it too much , he had to get back to the office . Clean his personal junk out of the taboret and pick up his paycheck from Miss Fink . It would be ready , he knew that ; when Martin was through with you he liked to get you out of the way , quickly . " Floor please ? " the voice questioned from the top of the elevator . " Go straight to hell ! " he blurted out . He had never before realized how many robots there were around . Oh how he hated them today . " I 'm sorry , that firm is not in this building , have you consulted the registry ? " " Twenty-three , " he said and his voice quavered , and he was glad he was alone in the elevator . The doors closed .  | There was a hall entrance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was halfway through before he realized why  --  then it was too late to turn back . The Mark VIII that he had nursed along and used for so many years lay on its side in the corner , uprooted and very dusty on the side that had stood against the wall . Good , he thought to himself , and at the same time knew it was stupid to hate a machine , but still relished the thought that it was being discarded too . In its place stood a columnar apparatus in a gray crackle cabinet . It reached almost to the ceiling and appeared as ponderous as a safe . " It 's all hooked up now , Mr. Martin , ready to go with a hundred-percent lifetime guarantee as you know . But I 'll just sort of preflight it for you and give you an idea just how versatile this machine is . " The speaker , dressed in gray coveralls of the exact same color as the machine 's finish , was pointing at it with a gleaming screwdriver . Martin watched , frowning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone else there , a thin young girl in a pink sweater who bovinely chewed at a cud of gum . " Let 's give Mark Nine here a real assignment , Mr. Martin . A cover for one of your magazines , something I bet you never thought a machine could tackle before , and normal machines ca n't .... " " Fink ! " Martin barked and she rambled over with a sheet of illustration board and a small color sketch . " We got just one cover in the house to finish , Mr. Martin , " she said weakly . " You okayed it for Mr. Pachs to do .... " " The hell with all that , " Martin growled , pulling it from her hand and looking at it closely . " This is for our best book , do you understand that , and we ca n't have no hack horsing around with rubber stamps . Not on the cover of Fighting Real War Battle Aces . " " You need not have the slightest worry , I assure you , " the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Mar-tin 's fingers . " I 'm going to show you the versatility of the Mark Nine , something that you might find it impossible to believe until you see it in action . A trained operator can cut a Mark Nine tape from a sketch or a description , and the results are always dramatic to say the least . " He seated himself at a console with typewriter keys that projected from the side of the machine , and while he typed , a ribbon of punched tape collected in the basket at one side . " Your new operator knows the machine code and breaks down any art concept into standard symbols , cut on tape . The tape can be examined or corrected , stored or modified and used over again if need be . There  --  I 've recorded the essence of your sketch and now I have one more question to ask you . In what style would you like it to be drawn ? " Martin made a porcine interrogative sound . " Startled are n't you , sir well I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the great masters of the Golden Age . You can have Kubert or Caniff , Giunta or Barry . For figure work  --  you can use Raymond , for your romances , capture the spirit of Drake . " " How 's about Pachs ? " " I 'm sorry , I 'm afraid I do n't know of ... " " A joke . Let 's get going . Caniff , that 's what I want to see . " Pachs felt himself go warm all over , then suddenly cold . Miss Fink looked over and caught his eye , and looked down , away . He clenched his fists and shifted his feet to leave , but listened instead . He could not leave , not yet . " ... and the tape is fed into the machine , the illustration board centered on the impression table , and the cycle button depressed . So simple , once a tape has been cut , that a child of three could operate it . A press on the button and just stand back . Within this genius of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built up . Inside the memory circuits are  | bits and pieces of every object that man has ever imagined or seen and drawn for his own edification . These are assembled in the correct manner in the correct proportions and assembled on the collator 's screen . When the final picture is complete the all-clear light flashes there it goes and we can examine the completed picture on the screen here . " Martin bent over and looked in through the hooded opening . " Just perfect , is n't it ? But if for any reason the operator is dissatisfied the image can be changed now in any manner desired by manipulation of the editorial controls . And when satisfied the print button is depressed , the image is printed in a single stroke onto the paper below . " A pneumatic groan echoed theatrically from the bowels of the machine as a rectangular box crept down on a shining plunger and pressed against the paper . It hissed and a trickle of vapor oozed out . The machine rose back to position and the man in the coveralls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that a fine piece of art ? " Martin grunted . Pachs looked at it and could n't take his eyes away : he was afraid he was going to be sick . The cover was not only good , it was good Caniff , just as the master might have drawn it himself . Yet the most horrible part was that it was Pachs 's own cover , his own layout . Improved . He had never been what might be called a tremendous artist , but he was n't a bad artist . He did all right in comics , and during the good years he was on top of the pack . But the field kept shrinking , and when the machines came in everything went bust and there was almost no spot for an artist , just a job here and there as sort of layout boy and machine minder . He had taken that  --  how many years now ? ? because old and dated as his work was , he was still better than any machine that drew heads with a rubber stamp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself any more that he was needed , or even useful .  | The machine was better . He realized then that he had been clenching his fists so tight that his nails had sunk into the flesh of his palms . He opened and rubbed them together and they were shaking badly . The Mark IX was turned off and they were all gone : he could hear Miss Fink 's machine takking away in the outer office . The young girl was telling Martin about the special supplies she would need to buy to operate the machine . When Pachs closed the connecting door he cut off the grumbling reply about extra expenses not being mentioned . Pachs warmed his fingers in his armpits until the worst of the tremors stopped . Then he carefully pinned a sheet of paper onto his drawing board and adjusted the light so it would not be in his eyes . With measured strokes he ruled out a standard comic page and separated it into six panels , making the sixth panel a big one , stretching the width of the page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stretch his back and walk over to the window and look out . Then he went back to the board and as the afternoon light faded he finished the inking . Very carefully he washed off his battered but still favorite Windsor &; Newton brush and slipped it back into the spring holder . There was a bustle in the outer office and it sounded like Miss Fink getting ready to leave , or maybe it was the new girl coming back with the supplies . In any case it was late , and he had to go now . Quickly , before he could change his mind , he ran full tilt at the window , his weight bursting through the glass , hurtled the twenty-three stories to the street below . Miss Fink heard the breaking glass and screamed , then screamed louder when she came into the room . Martin , complaining about the noise , followed her , but shut up when he saw what had happened . A bit of glass crunched under his shoes when he looked out of the window . The doll-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering crowd , sprawled from sidewalk to  | street and bent at an awful angle as it followed the step of the curb . " Oh God , Mr. Martin , oh God look at this . . . . " Miss Fink wailed . Martin went and stood next to her in front of the drawing board and looked at the page still pinned there . It was neatly done , well drawn and carefully inked . In the first panel was a self-portrait of Pachs working on a page , bent over this same drawing board . In the second panel he was sitting back and washing out his brush , in the third standing . In the fourth panel the artist stood before the window , nicely rendered in chiaroscuro with backlighting . Five was a forced perspective shot from above , down the vertical face of the building with the figure hurtling through the air toward the pavement below . In the last panel , in clear and horrible detail , the old man was bent broken and bloody over the wrecked fender of the car that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Look at that , will you , " Martin said disgustedly , tapping the drawing with his thumb . " When he went out the window he missed the car by a good two yards . Did n't I always tell you he was never any good at getting the details right ? "  | But this war was finished years before I was born ! How can one robot torpedo  --  fired that long ago  --  still be of any interest ? " Dail the Younger was overly persistent  --  it was extremely lucky for him that Ship-Commander Lian Stane , both by temperament and experience , had a tremendous reserve of patience . " It has been fifty years since the Greater Slavocracy was defeated  --  but that does n't mean eliminated , " Commander Stane said . He looked through the viewport of the ship , seeing ghostlike against the stars the pattern of the empire they had fought so long to destroy . " The Slavocracy expanded unchecked for over a thousand years . Its military defeat did n't finish it , just made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of that reconstruction , guiding them away from a slave economy . " " That I know all about , " Dail the Younger broke in with a weary sigh . " I 've been working on the planets since I came into the force . But what has that got to do with the Mosaic torpedo that we 're tracking ? There must have been a billion of them made and fired during the war . How can a single one be of interest this much later ? "  | " If you had read the tech reports , " Stane said , pointing to the thumb-thick folder on the chart table , " you would know all about it . " This advice was the closest the commander had ever come to censure . Dall the Younger had the good grace to flush slightly and listen with applied attention . " The Mosaic torpedo is a weapon of space war , in reality a robot-controlled spaceship . Once directed it seeks out its target , defends itself if necessary , then destroys itself and the ship it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding-energy breakdown . " " I never realized that they were robot-operated , " Dall said . " I thought robots had an ingrained resistance to killing peo-ple ? " " In-built rather than ingrained would be more accurate , " Stane said judiciously . " Robotic brains are just highly developed machines with no inherent moral sense . That is added afterward . It has been a long time since we built man-shaped robots with human-type brains . This is the age of the specialist , and robots can specialize far better than men ever could . The Mosaic torpedo brains have no moral sense if anything they are psychotic , overwhelmed by a death wish . Though there are , of course , controls on how much they can kill . All the torpedoes ever used by either side had mass detectors to defuse them when they approached an object with planetary mass , since the reaction started by a torpedo could just as easily destroy a world as a ship . You can understand our interest when in the last months of the war , we picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the data from its brain was filed and recently interpreted . The torpedo was aimed at the fourth planet of the star we are approaching now . " " Anything on the record about this planet ? " Dall asked . " Nothing ; it is an unexplored system at least as far as our records are concerned . But the Greater Slavocracy knew  | enough about this planet to want to destroy it . We are here to find out why . " Dail the Younger furrowed his brow , chewing at the idea . " Is that the only reason ? " he finally asked . " Since we stopped them from wiping out this planet , that would be the end of it , I should think . " " It 's thinking like that that shows why you are the low ranker on this ship , " Gunner Arnild snapped as he came in . Arnild had managed to grow old in a very short-lived service , losing in the process his patience for everything except his computers and guns . " Shall I suggest some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Firstly any enemy of the Slavocracy could be a friend of ours . Or conversely , there may be an enemy here that threatens the entire human race , and we may need to set off a Mosaic ourselves to finish the job the Slavers started . Then again , the Slavers may have had something here like a research center that they would rather have destroyed than let us see . Would n't you say that any one of these would make the planet worth investigating ? " " We shall be in the atmosphere within twenty hours , " Dail said as he vanished through the lower hatch . " I have to check the lubrication on the drive gears . " " You 're too easy on the kid , " Gunner Arnild said , staring moodily at the approaching star , already dimmed by the forward filters . " And you 're too hard , " Stane told him . " So I guess it evens out . You forget he never fought the Slavers . " Skimming the outer edges of the atmosphere of the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of a helical orbit , then fled back into the safety of space while the ship 's robot brain digested and made copies of the camera and detector instrument recordings . The duplicates were stored in a message torp , and only when the torp had started back to base did Commander Stane bother personally to examine the results of their survey .  | " We 're dispensable now , " he said , relaxing . " So the best thing we can do is to drop down and see what we can stir up . " Arnild grunted agreement , his index fingers unconsciously pressing invisible triggers . They leaned over the graphs and photographs spread out on the table . Dail peered between their shoulders and flipped through the photographs they tossed aside . He was first to speak . " Nothing much there , really . Plenty of water , a big island continent  --  and not much else . " " Nothing else is detectable , " Stane added , ticking off the graphs one by one . " No detectable radiation , no large masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy . No reason for us to be here . " " But we are , " Arnild growled testily . " So let 's touch down and find out more firsthand . Here 's a good spot ! " He tapped a photograph , then pushed it into the enlarger . " Could be a primitive hut city , people walking around , smoke . " " Those could be sheep in the fields , " Dail broke in eagerly . " And boats pulled up on the shore . We 'll find out something here . " " I 'm sure we will , " Commander Stane said . " Strap in for landing . " Lightly and soundlessly the ship fell out of the sky , curving in a gentle arc that terminated at the edge of a grove of tall trees , on a hill above the city . The motors whined to a stop and the ship was silent . " Report positive on the atmosphere , " Dail said , checking off the analyzer dials . " Stay at the guns , Arnild , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't shoot unless I tell you to . " " Or unless you 're dead , " Arnild said with complete lack of emotion . " Or unless I 'm dead , " Stane answered him , in the same toneless voice . " In which case you will assume command . "  | He and Dail buckled on planet kits , cycled through the lock , and sealed it behind them . The air was dry and pleasantly warm , filled with the freshness of growing plants . " Really smells good after that canned stuff , " Dail said . " You have a great capacity for stating the obvious . " Ar-nild 's voice rasped even more than usual when heard through the bone conductor phones . " Can you see what 's going on in the village ? " Dail fumbled his binoculars out . Commander Stane had been using his since they left the ship . " Nothing moving , " Stane said . " Send an Eye down there . " The Eye whooshed away from the ship and they could follow its slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred huts , simple pole-and-thatch affairs , and the Eye carefully investigated every one . " No one there , " Arnild said , as he watched the monitor screen . " The animals are gone too , the ones from the aerial pic . " " The people ca n't have vanished , " Dail said . " There are empty fields in every direction , completely without cover . And I can see smoke from their fires . " " The smoke 's there , the people are n't , " Arnild said testily . " Walk down and look for yourself . " The Eye lifted up from the village and drifted back toward the ship . It swung around the trees and came to a sudden stop in midair . " Hold it ! " Arnild 's voice snapped in their ears . " The huts are empty . But there 's someone in the tree you 're standing next to . About ten meters over your heads ! " Both men controlled a natural reaction to look up . They moved out a bit , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Far enough , " Arnild said . " I 'm shifting the Eye for a better look . " They could hear the faint drone of the Eye 's motors as it changed position .  | " It 's a girl . Wearing some kind of fur outfit . No weapons that I can see , but some kind of a pouch hanging from her waist . She 's just clutching onto the tree with her eyes closed . Looks like she 's afraid of falling . " The men on the ground could see her dimly now , a huddled shape against the straight trunk . " Do n't bring the Eye any closer , " Commander Stane said . " But turn the speaker on . Hook my phone into the circuit . " " You 're plugged in . " " We are friends . . . . Come down .... We will not hurt you . " The words boomed down from the floating speaker above their heads . " She heard it , but maybe she ca n't understand Esperanto , " Arnild said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . " Commander Stane had had a good command of Slaver during the war ; he groped in his memory for the words , doing a quick translation . He repeated the same phrase , only this time in the tongue of their defeated enemies . " That did something , Commander , " Arnild reported . " She jumped so hard she almost fell off . Then scooted up a couple of branches higher before she grabbed on again . " " Let me get her down , sir , " Dail asked . " I 'll take some rope and climb up after her . It 's the only way . Like getting a cat out of a tree . " Stane pushed the thought around . " It looks like the best answer , " he finally said . " Get the lightweight two-hundredmeter line and the climbing irons out of the ship . Do n't take too long . It 'll be getting dark soon . " The irons chunked into the wood and Dali climbed carefully up to the lower limbs . Above him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white patch of her face as she looked down at him . He started climbing again until Arnild 's voice snapped at him . " Hold it ! She 's climbing higher . Staying above you . "  | " What 'll I do , Commander ? " Dail asked , settling himself in the fork of one of the big branches . He felt exhilarated by the climb , his skin tingling slightly with sweat . He snapped open his collar and breathed deeply . " Keep going . She ca n't climb any higher than the top of the tree . " The climbing was easier now , the branches smaller and closer together . He went slowly so as not to frighten the girl into a misstep . The ground was out of sight , far below . They were alone in their own world of leaves and swaying boughs . The silver tube of the hovering Eye the only reminder of the watchers from the ship . Dail stopped to tie a loop in the end of the rope , doing it carefully so the knot would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this mission he felt as if he was doing a full part . The two old warhorses were n't bad shipmates , but they oppressed him with the years of their experience . But this was something he could do best and whistled softly through his teeth with the thought . It would have been possible for the girl to have climbed higher ; the branches could have held her weight . But for some reason she had retreated out along a branch . There was another close to it , with good handholds , and he shuffled slowly after her . " No reason to be afraid , " he said cheerfully , and smiled . " Just want to get you down safely and back to your friends . Why do n't you grab onto this rope ? " The girl just shuddered and backed away . She was young and good to look at , dressed only in a short fur kilt . Her hair was long , but had been combed and caught at the back of her head with a thong . The only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came closer he could see she was drenched with it . Her legs and hands shook with a steady vibration . Her teeth were clamped into her whitened lips and a thin trickle of blood reached to her chin . He had n't thought  | it possible that human eyes could have stared so widely , have been so filled with desperation . " You do n't have to be afraid , " he repeated , stopping just out of reach . The branch was thin and springy . If he tried to grab her they might both be bounced off it . He did n't want any accidents to happen now . Slowly pulling the rope from the coil , Dall tied it about his waist , then made a loop around the next branch . Out of the corner of his eye he saw the girl stir and look around wildly . " Friends ! " he said , trying to calm her . He translated into Slaver ; she had seemed to understand that before . " Noi'r venn ! " Her mouth opened wide and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tortured animal 's than a human voice . It confused him and he made a desperate grab . It was too late . She did n't fall . With all her strength she hurled herself from the limb , jumping toward the certain death she preferred to his touch . For a heartbeat she seemed to hang , contorted and fear-crazed , at the apex of her leap , before gravity clutched hold and pulled her crashing down through the leaves . Then Dall was falling too , grabbing for nonexistent handholds . The safety line he had tied held fast . In a half daze he worked his way back to the trunk and fumbled loose the knots . With quivering precision he made his way back to the ground . It took a long time , and a blanket was drawn over the deformed thing in the grass before he reached it . He did n't have to ask if she was dead . " I tried to stop her . I did my best . " There was a slight touch of shrillness to Dall 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he spread out the contents of the girl 's waist pouch . " We were watching with the Eye . There was no way to stop her when she decided to jump . " " No need to talk Slaver to her either , " Arnild said , coming  | out of the ship . He was going to add something , but he caught Commander Stane 's direct look and shut his mouth . Dail saw too . " I forgot ! " the young man said , looking back and forth at their expressionless faces . " I just remembered she had understood Slaver . I did n't think it would frighten her . It was a mistake maybe , but anyone can make a mistake : I did n't want her to die . . . . " He clamped his trembling jaws shut with an effort and turned away . " You better get some food started , " Commander Stane told him . As soon as the port had closed he pointed to the girl 's body . " Bury her under the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief meal ; none of them were very hungry . Stane sat at the chart table afterward , pushing the hard green fruit around with his forefinger . " This is what she was doing in the tree , why she could n't pull the vanishing act like the others . Picking fruit . She had nothing else in the pouch . Our landing next to the tree and trapping her was pure accident . " He glanced at Dall 's face , then turned quickly away . " It 's too dark to see now . Do we wait for morning ? " Arnild asked . He had a handgun disassembled on the table , adjusting and oiling the parts . Commander Stane nodded . " It ca n't do any harm  --  and it 's better than stumbling around in the dark . Leave an Eye with an infrared projector and pickup over the village and make a recording . Maybe we can find out where they all went . " " I 'll stay at the Eye controls , " Dail said suddenly . " I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The commander hesitated for a moment , then agreed . " Wake me if you see anything . Otherwise , get us up at dawn . " The night was quiet and nothing moved in the silent village of huts . Dail watched , tired but not sleepy , dozed a little until the alarm woke them all . At first light he and Commander  | Stane walked down the hill , an Eye floating ahead to cover them . Arnild stayed behind in the locked ship , at the controls . " Over this way , sir , " Dall said . " Something I found during the night when I was making sweeps with the Eye . " The pit edges had been softened and rounded by the weather ; large trees grew on the slopes . At the bottom , projecting from a pool of water , were the remains of rusted machin-ery . " I think they 're excavation machines , " Dall said . " Though it 's hard to tell , they 've been down there so long . " The Eye dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the wreckage . It sank below the surface and emerged after a minute , dripping with water . " Digging machines , all right , " Arnild reported . " Some of them turned over and half buried . Like they fell in , maybe thrown into the hole . All of them Slaver-built . " Commander Stane looked up intently . " Are you sure ? " he asked . " Sure as I can be when I read a label . " " Let 's get on to the village , " the commander said , chewing thoughtfully at the inside of his cheek . Dall the Younger discovered where the villagers had gone . It was really no secret ; they found out in the first hut they entered . The floor was made of pounded dirt , with a circle of rocks for a fireplace . All the other contents were of the simplest and crudest . Heavy , unfired clay pots , untanned furs , some eating utensils chipped out of hardwood . Dall was poking through a heap of woven mats behind the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir ! " he called . The opening was almost a meter in diameter and sank into the ground at an easy angle . The floor of the tunnel was beaten as hard as the floor of the hut . " They must be hiding out in there , " Commander Stane said .  | " Flash a light down and see how deep it is . " There was no way to tell . The hole was really a smoothwalled tunnel that turned at a sharp angle five meters inside the entrance . The Eye swooped down and hung , humming above the opening . " I took a look in some of the other huts , " Arnild said from the ship . " The Eye found a hole like this in every one of them . Want me to take a look inside ? " " Yes , but take it slowly , " Commander Stane told him . " If there are people hiding down there we do n't want to frighten them any more . Drift down and pull back if you find anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of sight . " Joined another tunnel , " Arnild reported . " And now another junction . Getting confused . . . do n't know if I can get it back the way I sent it in . " " The Eye is expendable , " the commander told him . " Keep going . " " Must be dense rock around . . . signal is getting weaker and I have a job holding control . A bigger cavern of some sort ... hold it ! There 's someone ! Caught a look at a man going into one of the side tunnels . " " Follow him , " Stane said . " Not easy , " Arnild said after a moment 's silence . " Looks like a dead end . A rock of some kind blocking the tunnel . It must have rolled it back and blocked the passage after went by . I 'll back out . . . blast ! " " What 's wrong ? " " Another rock behind the Eye  --  they 've got it trapped in that blocked-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I can get is an out-of-operation signal ! " Arnild sounded exasperated and angry . " Very neat , " Commander Stane said . " They lured it in , trapped it  --  then probably collapsed the roof of the tunnel .  | These people are very suspicious of strangers and seem to have a certain efficiency at getting rid of them . " " But why ? " Dail asked . He looked around at the crude construction of the hut . " What could these people possibly have that the Slavers could have wanted so badly ? Those machines we found , it 's obvious that the Slavers put a lot of time and effort into trying to dig down there . But did they ever find what they were looking for ? Did they try to destroy this planet because they had found it or because they had n't found it ? " " I wish I knew , " Commander Stane said glumly . " It would make my job a lot easier . I 'm getting a complete report off to HQ  --  maybe they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ship they noticed the fresh dirt in the grove of trees . There was a raw empty hole where the girl had been buried . The ground had been torn apart and hurled in every direction . There were slash marks on the trunks of the trees , made by sharp blades . . . or giant claws . Something or somebody had come for the girl , dug up her body and vented a burning rage on the ground and the trees . A crushed trail led to an opening between the roots of one of the trees . It slanted back and down . Its dark mouth was as enigmatic and mysterious as the other tunnels . Before they retired that night , Commander Stane made a double check that the ports were locked and all the alarm circuits activated . He went to bed but did not sleep . The answer to the problem seemed tantalizingly obvious , hovering just outside his reach . There should be enough facts here to draw a conclusion from . But what conclusion ? He drifted into a fitful doze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still dark , and he had the feeling something was terribly wrong . What had awakened him ? He groped in his sleep-filled memories . A sigh . A rush of air . It could have been the cycling of the air lock . Fighting down the sudden fear , he snapped on the lights and pulled his  | gun from the bedside rack . Arnild appeared , yawning and blinking in the doorway . " What 's going on ? " he asked . " Get Dall ! I think someone came into the ship . " " Gone out is more like it , " Arnild snuffed . " Dall 's not in his bunk . " " What ! " He ran to the control room . The alarm circuit had been turned off . There was a piece of paper on the control console . The commander grabbed it up and read the single word written on it . He gaped as comprehension struck him , then crushed the paper in his convulsive fist . " The fool ! " he shouted . " The damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire up two of them ! I 'll work the duplicate control ! " " But what happened ? " Arnild gaped . " What 's young Dall done ? " " Gone underground . Into the tunnels . We have to stop him ! " Dall was nowhere in sight , but there were footprints , fresh crumbled dirt on the lip of the tunnel under the trees . " I 'll take an Eye down there , " Commander Stane said . " You take another one down the next nearest entrance . Use the speakers . Tell them that we are friends . Tell them that in Slaver . " " But you saw what reaction the girl had when Dall told her that . " Arnild was puzzled , confused . " I know what happened , " Stane snapped . " But what other choice do we have ? Now get on with it ! " Arnild started to ask another question , but the concentrated intensity of the commander at the controls changed his mind . He sent his own Eye rocketing toward the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the message , they certainly did n't believe it . One Eye was caught in a dead-end tunnel when the opening behind it suddenly filled  | with soft soil . Commander Stane tried nosing the machine through the dirt , but it was firmly trapped and held . He could hear thumpings and digging as more soil was piled on top . Arnild 's Eye found a large underground chamber , filled with huddled and frightened sheep . There were none of the natives there . On the way out of this cavern the Eye was trapped under a fall of rocks . In the end , Commander Stane admitted defeat . " It 's up to them now . We ca n't affect the way this ends . Not one way or another . " " Something moving in the grove of trees , Commander , " Arnild said sharply . " Caught it on the detector . It 's gone now . " They went out hesitantly with their guns pointed , under a reddened dawn sky . They went , half-knowing what they would find , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course there was no hope . Dail the Younger 's body lay near the tunnel mouth , out of which it had been pushed . The red dawn glinted from red blood . He had died terribly . " They 're fiends ! Animals ! " Arnild shouted . " To do that to a man who only wanted to help them . Broke his arms and legs , scratched away most of his skin . His face nothing left ... " The aging gunner choked out a sound that was half gasp , half sob . " They ought to be bombed out , blown up ! Like the Slavers started . . . " He met the commander 's burning stare and fell silent . " That 's probably just how the Slavers felt , " Stane said . " Do n't you understand what happened here ? " Arnild shook his head dumbly . " Dall had a glimpse of the truth . His mistake was that he thought it was possible to change things . But at least he knew what the danger was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . That was why he left the note with the word slave ' on it . In case he did n't come back . "  | " What do you mean ? ? " " It 's really quite simple , " Arnild said wearily , leaning back against a tree . " Only we were looking for something more complex and technical . When it was n't really a physical problem , but a social one we were facing . This was a slave planet , set up and organized by the Slavers to fit their special needs . " " What ? " Arnild asked , still confused . " Slaves . The Slavers were constantly expanding , and you know that their style of warfare was expensive on manpower . They needed steady sources of supply , so must have had to create them . This planet was one answer . Made to order in a way . A single , lightly forested continent . With few places for the people to hide when the slave ships came . They must have planted settlements , given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology . Then they could go away to let the people here breed . After that they would return every few years and take as many slaves as they needed . Leave the others behind to replenish the stock . Only they reckoned without one thing . " Arnild 's numbness was wearing off . He understood now . " The adaptability of mankind , " he said . " Of course . The ability given enough time  --  to adapt to almost any extreme of environment . This is a perfect example . A cut-off population with no history , no written language . Just the desire to survive . Every few years unspeakable creatures drop out of the sky and steal their children . They try running away , but there is no place to run . They build boats , but there is no place to sail to . Nothing works .... " " Until one bright boy digs a hole , covers it up , and hides his family in it . And finds out it works . " " The beginning , " Commander Stane nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more elaborate . The Slavers would try to dig them out  --  so they started building defenses . This went on  --  until the slaves finally won . " This might very well have been the first planet to rebel  | successfully against the Greater Slavocracy . They could n't be dug out . Poison gas would just kill them  --  and they had no value dead . Machines sent after them were trapped like our Eyes . And men who were foolish enough to go down . . . " He could n't finish the sentence ; Dall 's body was stronger evidence than words could ever be . " But the hatred ? " Arnild asked . " The way the girl killed herself rather than be taken . " " The tunnels must have become a religion , a way of life , " Stane told him . " They had to be , to be kept in operation and repair during the long gap of years between visits by the Slavers . The children had to be taught that the demons come from the skies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Earth religions . Hatred and fear were firmly implanted so that everyone , no matter how young , would know what to do if a ship appeared . There must be entrances everywhere . Seconds after a ship is sighted the population can vanish underground . They knew we were Slavers since only demons come from the sky . " Dall must have guessed part of this . Only he thought he could reason with them , explain that the Slavers were gone and that they did n't have to hide anymore . That good men come from the skies . But that 's heresy , and by itself would be enough to get him killed . If they ever bothered to listen . " They were gentle when they carried Dall the Younger back to the ship . " It is going to be some job trying to convince these people of the truth . " Arnild said when they paused for a moment to rest . " I still do n't understand , though , why the Slavers wanted to blow the planet up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motive , " Commander Stane said . " Why does a conquering army blow up buildings and destroy monuments when it is forced to retreat ? Just frustration and anger , old human emotions . If I ca n't have it , you ca n't have it either . This planet must have  | annoyed the Slavers for years . A successful rebellion that they could n't put down . They kept trying to capture the rebels since they were incapable of admitting defeat at the hands of slaves . When they knew their war was lost , destruction of this planet was an easy vent for their emotions . I noticed you feeling the same way yourself when you saw Dall 's body . It 's a human reaction . " They were both old soldiers , so they did n't show their emotions too much when they put Dall 's corpse into the necro chamber and readied the ship for takeoff . But they were old men as well , much older since they had come to the planet , and they moved now with old men 's stiffness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window and burned on Andrew Rusch 's bare legs until discomfort dragged him awake from the depths of heavy sleep . Only slowly did he become aware of the heat and the damp and gritty sheet beneath his body . He rubbed at his gummed-shut eyelids , then lay there , staring up at the cracked and stained plaster of the ceiling , only half-awake and experiencing a feeling of dislocation , not knowing in those first waking moments just where he was , although he had lived in this room for over seven years . He yawned , and the odd sensation slipped away while he groped for the watch that he always put on the chair next to the bed ; then he yawned again as he blinked at the hands mistily seen behind the scratched crystal . Seven . . . seven o'clock in the morning , and there was a little number 9 in the middle of the square window . Monday the ninth of August , 1999 ? and hot as a furnace already , with the city still embedded in the heat wave that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andy scratched at a trickle of perspiration on his side , then moved his legs out of the patch of sunlight and bunched the pillow up under his neck . From the  | other side of the thin partition that divided the room in half there came a clanking whir that quickly rose to a high-pitched drone . " Morning . . . " he shouted over the sound , then began coughing . Still coughing , he reluctantly stood and crossed the room to draw a glass of water from the wall tank ; it came out in a thin , brownish trickle . He swallowed it , then rapped the dial on the tank with his knuckles , and the needle bobbed up and down close to the Empty mark . It needed filling ; he would have to see to that before he signed in at four o'clock at the precinct . The day had begun . A full-length mirror with a crack running down it was fixed to the front of the hulking wardrobe , and he poked his face close to it , rubbing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went in . No one should ever look at himself in the morning , naked and revealed , he decided with distaste , frowning at the dead white of his skin and the slight bow to his legs that was usually concealed by his pants . And how did he manage to have ribs that stuck out like those of a starved horse , as well as a growing potbelly both at the same time ? He kneaded the soft flesh and thought that it must be the starchy diet , that and sitting around on his chunk most of the time . But at least the fat was n't showing on his face . His forehead was a little higher each year , but was n't too obvious as long as his hair was cropped short . You have just turned thirty , he thought to himself , and the wrinkles are already starting around your eyes . And your nose is too big  --  was n't it Uncle Brian who always said that was because there was Welsh blood in the family ? And your canine teeth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit like a hyena . You 're a handsome devil , Andy Rusch , and it 's a wonder a girl like Shirl will even look at you , much less kiss you . He scowled at himself , then went to look for a handkerchief to blow his impressive Welsh nose . There was just a single pair of clean undershorts in the  | drawer and he pulled them on ; that was another thing he had to remember today , to get some washing done . The squealing whine was still coming from the other side of the partition as he pushed through the connecting door . " You 're going to give yourself a coronary , Sol , " he told the gray-bearded man who was perched on the wheelless bicycle , pedaling so industriously that perspiration ran down his chest and soaked into the bath towel that he wore tied around his waist . " Never a coronary , " Solomon Kahn gasped out , pumping steadily . " I been doing this every day for so long that my ticker would miss it if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular flushing with alcohol takes care of that . And no lung cancer since I could n't afford to smoke even if I wanted to , which I do n't . And at the age of seventy-five no prostatitis because ... " " Sol , please  --  spare me the horrible details on an empty stomach . Do you have an ice cube to spare ? " " Take two  --  it 's a hot day . And do n't leave the door open too long . " Andy opened the small refrigerator that squatted against the wall and quickly took out the plastic container of margarine , then squeezed two ice cubes from the tray into a glass and slammed the door . He filled the glass with water from the wall tank and put it on the table next to the margarine . " Have you eaten yet ? " he asked . " I 'll join you , these things should be charged by now . " Sol stopped pedaling and the whine died away to a moan , then vanished . He disconnected the wires from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bike , and carefully coiled them up next to the four black automobile storage batteries that were racked on top of the refrigerator . Then , after wiping his hands on his soiled towel sarong , he pulled out one of the bucket seats , salvaged from an ancient 1975 Ford , and sat down across the table from Andy .  | " I heard the six o'clock news , " he said . " The Eldsters are organizing another protest march today on relief headquarters . That 's where you 'll see coronaries ! " " I wo n't , thank God , I 'm not on until four and Union Square is n't in our precinct . " He opened the breadbox and took out one of the six-inch-square red crackers , then pushed the box over to Sol . He spread margarine thinly on it and took a bite , wrinkling his nose as he chewed . " I think this margarine has turned . " " How can you tell ? " Sol grunted , biting into one of the dry crackers . " Anything made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . " " Now you begin to sound like a naturist , " Andy said , washing his cracker down with cold water . " There 's hardly any flavor at all to the fats made from petrochemicals and you know there are n't any whales left so they ca n't use blubber ? it 's just good chlorella oil . " " Whales , plankton , herring oil , it 's all the same . Tastes fishy . I 'll take mine dry so I do n't grow no fins . " There was a sudden staccato rapping on the door and he groaned . " Not yet eight o'clock and already they are after you . " " It could be anything , " Andy said , starting for the door . " It could be but it 's not , that 's the callboy 's knock and you know it as well as I do and I bet you dollars to doughnuts that 's just who it is . See ? " He nodded with gloomy satisfaction when Andy unlocked the door and they saw the skinny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you want , Woody ? " Andy asked . " I don ' wan ' no-fin , " Woody lisped over his bare gums . Though he was in his early twenties , he did n't have a tooth in his head . " Lieutenant says bring , I bring . " He handed Andy the message board with his name written on the outside . Andy turned toward the light and opened it , reading the lieutenant 's spiky scrawl on the slate , then took the chalk and scribbled his initials after it and returned it to the messenger .  | He closed the door behind him and went back to finish his breakfast , frowning in thought . " Do n't look at me that way , " Sol said , " I did n't send the message . Am I wrong in guessing it 's not the most pleasant of news ? " " It 's the Eldsters , they 're jamming the Square already and precinct needs reinforcements . " " But why you ? This sounds like a job for the harness bulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that medieval slang ? Of course they need patrolmen for the crowd , but there have to be detectives there to spot known agitators , pickpockets , purse-grabbers , and the rest . It 'll be murder in that park today . I have to check in by nine , so I have enough time to bring up some water first . " Andy dressed slowly in slacks and a loose sport shirt , then put a pan of water on the windowsill to warm in the sun . He took the two five-gallon plastic jerry cans , and when he went out Sol looked up from the TV set , glancing over the top of his old-fashioned glasses . " When you bring back the water I 'll fix you a drink  --  or do you think it is too early ? " " Not the way I feel today , it 's not . " The hall was ink black once the door had closed behind him , and he felt his way carefully along the wall to the stairs , cursing and almost falling when he stumbled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flights down a window had been knocked through the wall and enough light came in to show him the way down the last two flights to the street . After the damp hallway the heat of Twenty-fifth Street hit him in a musty wave , a stifling miasma compounded of decay , dirt , and unwashed humanity . He had to make his way through the women who already filled the steps of the building , walking carefully so that he did n't step on the children who were playing below . The sidewalk was still in shadow but so jammed with people that he walked in the street , well away  | from the curb to avoid the rubbish and litter banked high there . Days of heat had softened the tar so that it gave underfoot , then clutched at the soles of his shoes . There was the usual line leading to the columnar red water point on the corner of Seventh Avenue , but it broke up with angry shouts and some waved fists just as he reached it . Still muttering , the crowd dispersed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel door . " What 's going on ? " Andy asked . " I thought this point was open until noon ? " The policeman turned , his hand automatically staying close to his gun until he recognized the detective from his own precinct . He tilted back his uniform cap and wiped the sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand . " Just had the orders from the sergeant , all points closed for twenty-four hours . The reservoir level is low because of the drought , they got ta save water . " " That 's a hell of a note , " Andy said , looking at the key still in the lock . " I 'm going on duty now and this means I 'm not going to be drinking for a couple of days .... " After a careful look around , the policeman unlocked the door and took one of the jerry cans from Andy . " One of these ought to hold you . " He held it under the faucet while it filled , then lowered his voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was another dynamiting job on the aqueduct upstate . " " Those farmers again ? " " It must be . I was on guard duty up there before I came to this precinct and it 's rough , they just as soon blow you up with the aqueduct at the same time . Claim the city 's stealing their water . " " They 've got enough , " Andy said , taking the full container . " More than they need . And there are thirty-five million people here in the city who get damn thirsty . " " Who 's arguing ? " the cop asked , slamming the door shut again and locking it tight .  | Andy pushed his way back through the crowd around the steps and went through to the backyard first . All of the toilets were in use and he had to wait , and when he finally got into one of the cubicles he took the jerry cans with him ; one of the kids playing in the pile of rubbish against the fence would be sure to steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed the dark flights once more and opened the door to the room he heard the clear sound of ice cubes rattling against glass . " That 's Beethoven 's Fifth Symphony that you 're playing , " he said , dropping the containers and falling into a chair . " It 's my favorite tune , " Sol said , taking two chilled glasses from the refrigerator , and with the solemnity of religious ritual he filled them and dropped a tiny pearl onion into each of them . Passed one to Andy , who sipped carefully at the chilled liquid . " It 's when I taste one of these , Sol , that I almost believe you 're not crazy after all . Why do they call them Gibsons ? " " A secret lost behind the mists of time . Why is a Stinger a Stinger or a Pink Lady a Pink Lady ? " " I do n't know  --  why ? I never tasted any of them . " " I do n't know either , but that 's the name . Like those green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean anything , just a name . " " Thanks , " Andy said , draining his glass . " The day looks better already . " He went into his room and took his holstered gun from the drawer and clipped it inside the waistband of his pants . His shield was on his key ring where he always kept it and he slipped his notepad in on top of it , then hesitated a moment . It was going to be a long and rough day and anything might happen . He dug his nippers out from under his shirts , then the soft plastic tube filled with shot . It might be needed in the crowd , safer than a gun with all those old people milling about . Not only that , but with the new austerity regulations  | you had to have a damn good reason for using up any ammunition . He washed as well as he could with the pint of water that had been warming in the sun on the windowsill , then scrubbed his face with the small shard of gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His razor blade was beginning to show obvious nicks along both edges and , as he honed it against the inside of his drinking glass , he thought that it was time to think about getting a new one . Maybe in the fall . Sol was watering his window box when Andy came out , carefully irrigating the rows of herbs and tiny onions . " Do n't take any wooden nickels , " he said without looking up from his work . Sol had a million of them , all old . What in the world was a wooden nickel ? The sun was higher now and the heat was mounting in the sealed tar and concrete valley of the street . The band of shade was smaller and the steps were so packed with humanity that he could n't leave the doorway . He carefully pushed by a tiny , runny-nosed girl dressed only in ragged gray underwear and descended a step . The gaunt women moved aside reluctantly , ignoring him , but the men stared at him with a cold look of hatred stamped across their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though they were all members of the same angry family . Andy threaded his way through the last of them and when he reached the sidewalk he had to step over the outstretched leg of an old man who sprawled there . He looked dead , not asleep , and he might be for all that anyone cared . His foot was bare and filthy and a string tied about his ankle led to a naked baby that was sitting vacantly on the sidewalk chewing on a bent plastic dish . The baby was as dirty as the man and the string was tied about its chest under the pipestem arms because its stomach was swollen and heavy . Was the old man dead ? Not that it mattered ; the only work he had to do in the world was to act as an anchor for the baby . He could do that job just as well alive or dead .  | Out of the room now , well away and unable to talk to Sol until he returned , he realized that once again he had not managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing to do , but he kept forgetting it , avoiding it . Sol was always talking about how horny he always was and how often he used to get laid when he was in the army . He would understand . They were roommates , that was all . There was nothing else between them . Friends , sure . But bringing a girl in to live would n't change that . So why had n't he told him ? FALL " Everybody says this is the coldest October ever , I never seen a colder one . And the rain too , never hard enough to fill the reservoir or anything , but just enough to make you wet so you feel colder . " " Ai n't that right ? " Shirl nodded , hardly listening to the words , but aware by the rising intonation of the woman 's voice that a question had been asked . The line moved forward and she shuffled a few steps behind the woman who had been speaking  --  a shapeless bundle of heavy clothing covered with a torn plastic raincoat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she resembled a lumpy sack . Not that I look much better , Shirl thought , tugging the fold of blanket farther over her head to keep out the persistent drizzle . It would n't be much longer now , there were only a few dozen people ahead . But it had taken a lot more time than she thought it would ; it was almost dark . A light came on over the tank car , glinting off its black sides and lighting up the slowly falling curtain of rain . The line moved again and the woman ahead of Shirl waddled forward , pulling the child after her . A bundle as wrapped and shapeless as its  | mother , its face hidden by a knotted scarf , that produced an almost constant whimpering . " Stop that , " the woman said . She turned to Shirl , her puffy face a red lumpiness around the dark opening of her almost toothless mouth . " He 's crying because he 's been to see the doc , thinks he 's sick but it 's only the kwash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . " You can tell when they swell up and get the black spots on the knees . Had to sit two weeks in the Bellevue clinic to see a doc who told me what I knew already . But that 's the only way you get him to sign the slip . Got a peanut-butter ration that way . My old man loves the stuff . You live on my block , do n't you ? I think I seen you there ? " " Twenty-sixth Street , " Shirl said , taking the cap off the jerry can and putting it into her coat pocket . She felt chilled through and was sure she was catching a cold . " That 's right , I knew it was you . Stick around and wait for me , we 'll walk back together . It 's getting late and plenty of punks would like to grab the water , they can always sell it . Mrs. Ramirez in my building , she 's a Spic but she 's all right , you know , her family been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black eye so swole up she ca n't see through it and two teeth knocked out . Some punk got her with a club and took her water away . " " Yes , I 'll wait for you , that 's a good idea , " Shirl said , suddenly feeling very alone . " Cards , " the patrolman said and she handed him the three Welfare cards , hers , Andy 's , and Sol 's . He held them to the light , then handed them back to her . " Six quarts , " he called out to the valve man . " That 's not right , " Shirl said . " Reduced ration today , lady , keep moving , there 's a lot of people waiting . " She held out the jerry can and the valve man slipped the end  | of a large funnel into it and ran in the water . " Next , " he called out . The jerry can gurgled when she walked and was tragically light . She went and stood near the policeman until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the other carrying a five-gallon kerosene can that seemed almost full . She must have a big family . " Let 's go , " the woman said and the child trailed , mewling faintly , at the end of her arm . As they left the Twelfth Avenue railroad siding it grew darker , the rain soaking up all the failing light . The buildings here were mostly old warehouses and factories with blank solid walls concealing the tenants hidden away inside ; the sidewalks were wet and empty . The nearest streetlight was a block away . " My husband will give me hell coming home this late , " the woman said as they turned the corner . Two figures blocked the sidewalk in front of them . " Let 's have the water , " the nearest one said , and the distant light reflected from the knife he held before him . " No , do n't ! Please do n't ! " the woman begged and swung her can of water out behind her , away from them . Shirl huddled against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were just young boys , teenagers . But they still had a knife . " The water ! " the first one said , jabbing his knife at the woman . " Take it , " she screeched , swinging the can like a weight on the end of her arm . Before the boy could dodge , it caught him full in the side of the head , knocking him howling to the ground , the knife flying from his fingers . " You want some too ! " she shouted , advancing on the second boy . He was unarmed . " No , I do n't want no trouble , " he begged , pulling at the first one 's arm , then retreating when she approached . When she bent to pick up the fallen knife , he managed to drag the other  | boy to his feet and half-carry him around the corner . It had only taken a few seconds and all the time Shirl had stood with her back to the wall , trembling with fear . " They got some surprise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to admire . " I can use this better than they can . Just punks , kids . " She was excited and happy . During the entire time she had never released her grip on the child 's hand ; it was sobbing louder . There was no more trouble and the woman went with Shirl as far as her door . " Thank you very much , " Shirl said . " I do n't know what I would have done ... " " That 's no trouble , " the woman beamed . " You saw what I did to him and who got the knife now ! " She stamped away , hauling the heavy can in one hand , the child in the other . Shirl went in . " Where have you been ? " Andy asked when she pushed open the door . " I was beginning to wonder what had happened to you . " It was warm in the room , with a faint odor of fishy smoke . He and Sol were sitting at the table with drink in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been a block long . They only gave me six quarts , the ration has been cut again . " She saw his black look and decided not to tell him about the trouble on the way back . He would be twice as angry then and she did n't want this meal to be spoiled . " That 's really wonderful , " Andy said sarcastically . " The ration was already too small  --  so now they lower it even more . Better get out of those wet things , Shirl . Then Sol will pour you a Gibson . His homemade vermouth has ripened  --  and I bought some vodka . " " Drink up , " Sol said , handing her the chilled glass . " I made some soup with that ener-G junk , it 's the only way it 's edible , and it should be just about ready . We 'll have that for the first course , before ? " He finished the sentence by jerking his head in the direction of the refrigerator .  | " What 's up ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No secret , " Shirl said , opening the refrigerator , " just a surprise . I got these today in the market , one for each of us . " She took out a plate with three small soylent burgers on it . " They 're the new ones , they had them on TV , with the smokybarbecue flavor . " " They must have cost a fortune , " Andy said . " We wo n't eat for the rest of the month . " " They 're not as expensive as all that . Anyway , it was my own money , not the budget money I used . " " It does n't make any difference , money is money . We could probably live for a week on what these things cost . " " Soup 's on , " Sol said , sliding the plates onto the table . Shirl had a lump in her throat so she could n't say anything ; she sat and looked at her plate and tried not to cry . " I 'm sorry , " Andy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  we have to look ahead . City income tax is higher , eighty percent now , because of the raised Welfare payment , so it 's going to be rough going this winter . Do n't think I do n't appreciate it .... " " If you do , so why do n't you shut up right there and eat your soup ? " Sol said . " Keep out of this , Sol , " Andy said . " I 'll keep out of it when you keep the fight out of my room . Now come on , a nice meal like this , it should n't be spoiled . " Andy started to answer him , then changed his mind . He reached over and took Shirl 's hand . " It is going to be a good dinner , " he said . " Let 's all enjoy it . " " Not that good , " Sol said , puckering his mouth over a spoonful of soup . " Wait until you try this stuff . But the burgers will take the taste out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they spooned up the soup , until Sol started on one of his army stories about New Orleans and it was so incredibly impossible that they had to laugh , and  | after that things were better . Sol shared out the rest of the Gibsons while Shirl served the burgers . " If I was drunk enough this would almost taste like meat , " Sol announced , chewing happily . " They are good , " Shirl said . Andy nodded agreement . She finished the burger quickly and soaked up the juice with a scrap of weedcracker , then sipped at her drink . The trouble on the way home with the water already seemed far distant . What was it the woman had said was wrong with the child ? " Do you know what kwash ' is ? " she asked . Andy shrugged . " Some kind of disease , that 's all I know . Why do you ask ? " " There was a woman next to me in line for the water , I was talking to her . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do n't think she should have had him out in the rain , sick like that . And I was wondering if it was catching . " " That you can forget about , " Sol said . " Kwash ' is short for kwashiorkor . ' If , in the interest of good health , you watched the medical programs like I do , or opened a book , you would know all about it . You ca n't catch it because it 's a deficiency disease like beriberi . " " I never heard of that either , " Shirl said . " There 's not so much of that , but there 's plenty of kwash . It comes from not eating enough protein . They used to have it only in Africa but now they got it right across the whole U.S. Is n't that great ? There 's no meat around , lentils and soybeans cost too much , so the mamas stuff the kids with weedcrackers and candy , whatever is cheap .... " The light bulb flickered , then went out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch in the maze of wiring on top of the refrigerator . A dim bulb lit up , connected to his batteries . " Needs a charge , " he said , " but it can wait until morning . You should n't exercise after eating , bad for the circulation and digestion . "  | " I 'm sure glad you 're here , Doctor , " Andy said . " I need some medical advice . I 've got this trouble . You see  --  everything I eat goes to my stomach .... " " Very funny , Mr. Wiseguy . Shirl , I do n't see how you put up with this joker . " They all felt better after the meal and they talked for a while , until Sol announced he was turning off the light to save the juice in the batteries . The small bricks of sea coal had burned to ash and the room was growing cold . They said good night and Andy went in first to get his flashlight ; their room was even colder than the other . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not really tired , but it 's the only way to keep warm . " Andy flicked the overhead light switch uselessly . " The current is still off and there are some things I have to do . What is it  --  a week now since we had any electricity in the evening ? " " Let me get into bed and I 'll work the flash for you  --  will that be all right ? " " It 'll have to do . " He opened his notepad on top of the dresser , laid one of the reusable forms next to it , then began copying information into the report . With his left hand he kept a slow and regular squeezing on the flashlight that produced steady illumination . The city was quiet tonight with the people driven from the streets by the cold and the rain ; the whir of the tiny generator and the occasional squeak of the stylo on plastic sounded unnaturally loud . There was enough light from the flash for Shirl to get undressed by . She shivered when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter pajamas , a much-darned pair of socks she used for sleeping in , then put her heavy sweater on top . The sheets were cold and damp ; they had n't been changed since the water shortage , though she did try to air them out as often as she could . Her cheeks were damp as well , as damp as the sheets were when she put her fingertips up to touch them , and she realized that she was  | crying . She tried not to sniffle and bother Andy . He was doing his best , was n't he ? Doing everything that it was possible to do . Yes , it had been a lot different before she came here , an easy life , good food and a warm room , and her own bodyguard , Tab , when she went out . And all she had to do was sleep with him a couple of times a week . She had hated it , even the touch of his hands , but at least it had been quick . Having Andy in bed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . She shivered again and wished she could stop crying . WINTER New York City trembled on the brink of disaster . Every locked warehouse was a nucleus of dissent , surrounded by crowds who were hungry and afraid and searching for someone to blame . Their anger incited them to riot , and the food riots turned to water riots and then to looting wherever this was possible . The police fought back , only the thinnest of barriers between angry protest and bloody chaos . At first nightsticks and weighted clubs stopped the trouble , and when this failed gas dispersed the crowd . The tension grew , since the people who fled only reassembled again in a different place . The solid jets of water from the riot trucks stopped them easily when they tried to break into the welfare stations , but there were not enough trucks , nor was there more water to be had once they had pumped dry their tanks . The Health Department had forbidden the use of river water : it would have been like spraying poison . The little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were springing up throughout the city . With the streets blocked in many places the firefighting equipment could not get through and the trucks were forced.to make long detours . Some of the fires  | were spreading and by noon all of the equipment had been committed and was in use . The first gun was fired a few minutes past twelve on the morning of December 21st , by a Welfare Department guard who killed a man who had broken open a window of the Tompkins Square food depot and had tried to climb in . This was the first but not the last shot fired nor was it the last person to be killed . Flying wire sealed off some of the trouble areas , but there was only a limited supply of it . When it ran out the copters fluttered helplessly over the surging streets and acted as aerial observation posts for the police , finding the places where reserves were sorely needed . It was a fruitless labor because there were no reserves ; everyone was in the front line . After the first conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the day and most of the night , he along with every other policeman in the city was braving violence and giving violence to restore law and order to a city torn by battle . The only rest he had was after he had fallen victim to his own gas and had managed to make his way to the Department of Hospitals ambulance for treatment . An orderly washed out his eyes and gave him a tablet to counteract the gut-tearing nausea . He lay on one of the stretchers inside , clutching his helmet , bombs , and club to his chest while he recovered . The ambulance driver sat on another stretcher by the door , armed with a .30-caliber carbine , to discourage anyone from too great an interest in the ambulance or its valuable surgical contents . Andy would like to have lain there longer , but the cold mist was rolling in through the open doorway , and he began to shiver so hard that his teeth shook together . It was difficult to drag himself to his feet and climb to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little better and warmer . The attack had been broken up and he moved slowly to join the nearest cluster of blue-coated figures , wrinkling his nose at the foul odor of his clothes .  | From this point on , the fatigue never left him and he had memories only of shouting faces , running feet , the sound of shots , screams , the thud of gas grenades . Of something unseen that had been thrown at him and hit the back of his hand and raised an immense bruise . By nightfall it was raining , a cold downpour mixed with sleet , and it was this and exhaustion that drove the people from the streets , not the police . Yet when the crowds were gone the police found that their work was just beginning . Gaping windows and broken doorways had to be guarded until they could be repaired , the injured had to be found and brought in for treatment , while the Fire Department needed aid in halting the countless fires . This went on through the night and at dawn Andy found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name being called off from a list by Lieutenant Grassioli . " And that 's all that can be spared , " the lieutenant added . " You men draw rations before you leave and turn in your riot equipment . I want you all back here at eighteen-hundred and I do n't want excuses . Our troubles are n't over yet . " Sometime during the night the rain had stopped . The rising sun cast long shadows down the crosstown streets , putting a golden sheen on the wet , black pavement . A burned-out brownstone was still smoking and Andy picked his way through the charred wreckage that littered the street in front of it . On the corner of Seventh Avenue was the crushed wreckage of two pedicabs , already stripped of any usable parts , and a few feet farther on , the huddled body of a man . He might be asleep , but when Andy passed , the upturned face gave violent evidence that the man was dead . He walked on , ignoring it . The Department of Sanitation would be collecting only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subway entrance , blinking at the light . During the summer everyone laughed at the cavemen  --  the people whom Welfare had assigned to living  | quarters in the stations of the now-silent subways . But as the cold weather approached the laughter was replaced by envy . Perhaps it was filthy down there , dusty , dark , but there were always a few electric heaters turned on . They were n't living in luxury , but at least Welfare did n't let them freeze . Andy turned into his own block . Going up the stairs in his building , he trod heavily on some of the sleepers but was too fatigued to care  --  or even notice . He had trouble fumbling his key into the lock and Sol heard him and came to open it . " I just made some soup , " Sol said . " You timed it perfectly . " Andy pulled the broken remains of some weedcrackers from his coat pocket and spilled them onto the table . " Been stealing food ? " Sol asked , picking up a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being given out for two more days ? " " Police ration . " " Only fair . You ca n't beat up the citizenry on an empty stomach . I 'll throw some of these into the soup , give it some body . I guess you did n't see TV yesterday so you would n't know about all the fun and games in Congress . Things are really jumping .... " " Is Shirl awake yet ? " Andy asked , shucking out of his coat and dropping heavily into a chair . Sol was silent a moment , then he said slowly , " She 's not here . " Andy yawned . " It 's plenty early to go out . Why ? " " Not today , Andy . " Sol stirred the soup with his back turned . " She went out yesterday , a couple of hours after you did . She 's not back yet . " " You mean she was out all the time during the riots  --  and last night too ? What did you do ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What could I do ? Go out and get myself trampled to death like the rest of the old fogies ? I bet she 's all right . She probably  | saw all the trouble and decided to stay with a friend instead of coming back here . " " What friend ? What are you talking about ? I have to go find her . " " Sit ! " Sol ordered . " What can you do out there ? Have some soup and get some sleep , that 's the best thing you can do . She 'll be okay . I know it , " he added reluctantly . " What do you know , Sol ? " Andy took him by the shoulders , half turning him from the stove . " Do n't handle the merchandise ! " Sol shouted , pushing the hand away . Then , in a quieter voice : " All I know is she just did n't go out of here for nothing , she had a reason . She had her old coat on , but I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And nylon stockings . A fortune on her legs . And when she said so long I saw she had lots of makeup on . " " Sol  --  what are you trying to say ? " " I 'm not trying  --  I 'm saying . She was dressed for visiting , not for shopping , like she was on the way out to see someone . Her old man , maybe , she could be visiting him . " " Why should she want to see him ? " " You tell me ? You two had a fight , did n't you ? Maybe she went away for a while to cool off . " " A fight . . . I guess so . " Andy dropped back into the chair , squeezing his forehead with his palms . Had it only been last night ? No , the night before last . It seemed like a hundred years since they had had that stupid argument . But they were bickering so much these days . One more fight should n't make any difference . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her things  --  anything with her ? " he asked . " Just a little bag , " Sol said , and put a steaming bowl on the table in front of Andy . " Eat up . I 'll pour one for myself . " Then , " She 'll be back . " Andy was almost too tired to argue  --  and what could be said ? He spooned the soup automatically , then realized as he  | tasted it that he was very hungry . He ate with his elbow on the table , his free hand supporting his head . " You should have heard the speeches in the Senate yester-day , " Sol said . " Funniest show on Earth . They 're trying to push this Emergency Bill through  --  some emergency , it 's only been a hundred years in the making  --  and you should hear them talking all around the little points and not mentioning the big ones . " His voice settled into a rich Southern accent . " Faced by dire straits , we propose a survey of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delta , suh , of the mightiest of rivers , the Mississippi . Dikes and drains , suh , science , suh , and you will have here the richest farmlands in the Western World ! " Sol blew on his soup angrily . " Dikes ' is right another finger in the dike . They 've been over this ground a thousand times before . But does anyone mention out loud the sole and only reason for the Emergency Bill ? They do not . After all these years they 're too chicken to come right out and tell the truth , so they got it hidden away in one of the little riders tacked onto the bottom . " " What are you talking about ? " Andy asked , only half listening , still worrying about Shirl . " Birth control , that 's what . They are finally getting around to legalizing clinics that will be open to anyone  --  married or not  --  and making it a law that all mothers must be supplied with birth-control information . Boy , are we going to hear some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pope will really plotz ! " " Not now , Sol , I 'm tired . Did Shirl say anything about when she would be back ? " " Just what I told you . . . " He stopped and listened to the sound of footsteps coming down the hall . They stopped and there was a light knocking on the door . Andy was there first , twisting at the knob , tearing the door open . " Shirl ! " he said . " Are you all right ? "  | " Yes , sure  --  I 'm fine . " He held her to him , tightly , almost cutting off her breath . " With the riots  --  I did n't know what to think , " he said . " I just came in a little while ago myself . Where have you been ? What happened ? " " I just wanted to get out for a while , that 's all . " She wrinkled her nose . " What 's that funny smell ? " He stepped away from her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of my own puke gas and heaved up . It 's hard to get off . What do you mean that you wanted to get out for a while ? " " Let me get my coat off . " Andy followed her into the other room and closed the door behind them . She was taking a pair of high-heeled shoes out of the bag she carried and putting them into the closet . " Well ? " he said . " Just that , it 's not complicated . I was feeling trapped in here , with the shortages and the cold and everything , and never seeing you . And I felt bad about the fight we had . Nothing seemed to be going right . So I thought if I dressed up and went to one of the restaurants where I used to go , just to have a cup of coffee or something , I might feel better . A morale booster , you know . " She looked up at his cold face , then glanced quickly away . " Then what happened ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witness box , Andy . Why the accusing tone ? " He turned his back and looked out the window . " I 'm not accusing you of anything , but you were out all night . How do you expect me to feel ? " " Well , you know how bad it was yesterday , I was afraid to come back . I was up at Curly 's ? " " The meateasy ? " " Yes , but if you do n't eat anything it 's not expensive . It 's just the food that costs . I met some people I knew and we talked , they were going to a party and invited me and I went  | along . We were watching news about the riots on TV and no one wanted to go out , so the party just went on and on . " She paused . " That 's all . " " All ? " An angry question , a dark suspicion . " That 's all , " she said , and her voice was now as cold as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull off her dress , and their words lay like a cold barrier between them . Andy dropped onto the bed and turned his back on her as well so that they were like strangers , even in the tiny room . S P R I N G The funeral drew them together as nothing else had during the cold depths of the winter . It was a raw day , gusting wind and rain , but there was still a feeling that winter was on the way out . But it had been too long a winter for Sol and his cough had turned into a cold , the cold into pneumonia , and what can an old man do in a cold room without drugs in a winter that does not seem to end ? Die , that was all , so he had died . They had forgotten their differences during his illness and Shirl had nursed him as best she could , but careful nursing does not cure pneumonia . The funeral had been as brief and cold as the day and in the early darkness they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back half an hour before there was a quick rapping on the door . Shirl gasped . " The callboy . They ca n't ! You do n't have to work today . " " Do n't worry . Even Grassy would n't go back on his word about a thing like this . And besides , that 's not the callboy 's knock . " " Maybe a friend of Sol 's who could n't get to the funeral . " She went to unlock the door and had to blink into the darkness of the hall for a moment before she recognized the man standing there .  | " Tab ! It is you , is n't it ? Come in , do n't stand there . Andy , I told you about Tab my bodyguard .... " " Afternoon , Miss Shirl , " Tab said stoically , staying in the hall . " I 'm sorry , but this is no social call . I 'm on the job now . " " What is it ? " Andy asked , walking over next to Shirl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is offered to me , " Tab said . He was unsmiling and gloomy . " I 've been in the bodyguard pool since September , just the odd jobs , no regular assignments . We take whatever work we can get . A man turns down a job , he goes right back to the end of the list . I have a family to feed .... " " What are you trying to say ? " Andy asked . He was aware that someone was standing in the darkness behind Tab and could tell by the shuffle of feet that there were others out of sight down the hall . " Do n't take no guff , " the man in back of Tab said in an unpleasant nasal voice . He stayed behind the bodyguard where he could not be seen . " I got the law on my side . I paid you . Show him the order ! " " I think I understand now , " Andy said . " Get away from the door , Shirl . Come inside Tab , so we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the hall tried to follow him . " You do n't go in there without me " he shrilled . His voice was cut off as Andy slammed the door in his face . " I wish you had n't done that , " Tab said . He was wearing his spike-studded iron knuckles , his fist clenched tight around them . " Relax , " Andy said . " I just wanted to talk to you alone first , find out what was going on . He has a squat-order , does n't he ? " Tab nodded , looking unhappily down at the floor . " What on earth are you two talking about ? " Shirl asked , worriedly glancing back and forth at their set expressions . Andy did n't answer and Tab turned to her . " A squat-order is issued by the court to anyone who can prove they are really  | in need of a place to live . They only give so many out , and usually just to people with big families that have had to get out of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and find a vacant apartment or room or anything like that , and the order is sort of a search warrant . There can be trouble , people do n't want to have strangers walking in on them , that kind of thing , so anyone with a squat-order takes along a bodyguard . That 's where I come in ; the party out there in the hall , name of Belicher , hired me . " " But what are you doing here ? " Shirl asked , still not under-standing . " Because Belicher is a ghoul , that 's why , " Andy said bitterly . " He hangs around the morgue looking for bodies . " " That 's one way of saying it , " Tab answered , holding on to his temper . " He 's also a guy with a wife and kids and no place to live , that 's another way of looking at it . " There was a sudden hammering on the door and Belicher 's complaining voice could be heard outside . Shirl finally realized the significance of Tab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here because you 're helping them , " she said . " They found out that Sol is dead and they want his room . " Tab could only nod mutely . " There 's still a way out , " Andy said . " If we had one of the men here from my precinct , living in here , then those people could n't get in . " The knocking was louder and Tab took a half step backward toward the door . " If there was somebody here now , that would be okay , but Belicher could probably take the thing to squat court and get occupancy anyway because he has a family . I 'll do whatever I can to help you but Belicher , he 's still my employer . " " Do n't open that door , " Andy said sharply . " Not until we have this straightened out . " " I have to what else can I do ? " He straightened up and  | closed his fist with knucks on it . " Do n't try to stop me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law about this . " " Tab , must you ? " Shirl asked in a low voice . He turned to her , eyes filled with unhappiness . " We were good friends once , Shirl , and that 's the way I 'm going to remember it . But you 're not going to think much of me after this because I have to do my job . I have to let them in . " " Go ahead , open the damn door , " Andy said bitterly , turning his back and walking over to the window . The Belichers swarmed in . Mr. Belicher was thin , with a strangely shaped head , almost no chin , and just enough intelligence to sign his name to a Welfare application . Mrs. Belicher was the support of the family ; from the flabby fat of her body came the children , all seven of them , to swell the Relief allotment on which they survived . Number eight was pushing an extra bulge out of the dough of her flesh ; it was really number eleven since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident . The largest girl , she must have been all of twelve , was carrying the sore-covered infant , which stank abominably and cried continuously . The other children shouted at each other now , released from the silence and tension of the dark hall . " Oh looka the nice fridge , " Mrs. Belicher said , waddling over and opening the door . " Do n't touch that , " Andy said , and Belicher pulled him by the arm . " I like this room  --  it 's not big you know , but nice . What 's in here ? " He started toward the door in the partition . " That 's my room , " Andy said , slamming it shut in his face . " Just keep out of there . " " No need to act like that , " Belicher said , sidling away quickly like a dog that has been kicked too often . " I got my rights . The law says I can look wherever I want with a squat-order . " He moved farther away as Andy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm doubting your word , mister , I believe you . This room here is fine , got a good table , chairs , bed ... " " Those things belong to me . This is an empty room , and a small one at that . It 's not big enough for you and all your family . " " It 's big enough . We lived in smaller ... " " Andy  --  stop them ! Look ! " Shirl 's unhappy cry spun Andy around and he saw that two of the boys had found the packets of herbs that Sol had grown so carefully in his window box , were tearing them open , thinking that it was food of some kind . " Put those things down , " he shouted , but before he could reach them they had tasted the herbs , then spat them out . " Burn my mouth ! " the bigger boy screamed and sprayed the contents of the packet on the floor . The other boy bounced up and down with excitement and began to do the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from Andy and before he could stop them the packets were empty . As soon as Andy turned away , the younger boy , still excited , climbed on the table  --  his mud-stained foot wrappings leaving filthy smears  --  and turned up the TV . Blaring music crashed over the screams of the children and the ineffectual calls of their mother . Tab pulled Belicher away as he opened the wardrobe to see what was inside . " Get these kids out of here , " Andy said , white-faced with rage . " I got a squat-order , I got rights , " Belicher shouted , backing away and waving an imprinted square of plastic . " I do n't care what rights you have , " Andy told him , opening the hall door . " We 'll talk about that when these brats are outside . " Tab settled it by grabbing the nearest child by the scruff of the neck and pushing it out through the door . " Mr. Rusch is right , " he said . " The kids can wait outside while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavily on the bed and closed her eyes , as though all this had nothing to do with her . Mr. Belicher retreated against the wall saying something that no one heard or bothered to listen to . There were some shrill cries and angry sobbing from the hall and the last child was expelled . Andy looked around and realized that Shirl had gone into their room ; he heard the key turn in the lock . " I suppose this is it ? " he said , looking steadily at Tab . The bodyguard shrugged helplessly . " I 'm sorry , Andy , honest to God I am . What else can I do ? It 's the law , and if they want to stay here you ca n't get them out . " " It 's the law , it 's the law , " Belicher echoed tonelessly . There was nothing Andy could do with his clenched fists and he had to force himself to open them . " Help me carry these things into the other room , will you , Tab ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end of the table . " Try and explain to Shirl about my part in this , will you ? I do n't think she understands that it 's just a job I have to do . " Their footsteps crackled on the dried herbs and seeds that littered the floor and Andy did not answer him .  | Well if it is n't Dirty Old Jim diGriz ! " The man 's ugly face broke into an evil grin when he saw me standing there , handcuffed to the large policeman . He threw the door wide with unconcealed pleasure , stepped out as the handcuffs were removed , and took me firmly  --  a little too firmly by the arm and hauled me forward . I tottered but kept my balance , shuffled through the door , passed under the verdigris-covered brass plate with its penetrating message : THROUGH THIS GATE PASS THE ANTIQUATED CRIMINAL CROCKS OF THE GALAXY Great stuff . That 's the way with the police  --  always kick a man when he 's down . I had to shuffle faster as the sadistic attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I gasped , pulling feebly at his restricting hand as I tried to sit on the bench against the wall . " Plenty time to sit later , Pops that 's about all you will be doing . You got ta see the warden first . " I could only make feeble resistance as he hauled me down the corridor to the heavy steel door . He knocked loudly . I staggered and gasped and found myself facing a mirror on the wall with an admonitory warning over it . ARE YOU CLEAN ? ARE YOU NEAT ? WHEN 'S THE LAST TIME YOU WASHED YOUR FEET ? " Ca n't remember . . . " I quavered . Looking with trembling disgust at my mirrored image . Wispy white hair tangled and matted . A white string of drool on the pendent lower lip . Skin wattled and doughy , eyes red and poochy . Not nice . " In ! " my keeper ordered as a green light flickered and the door clicked open . He pushed me forward with a meaty hand ; I stumbled and fought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before me the warden brooded over a thick file . " Yours , " he said grimly , looking up at me . He had the face of an unshaven camel . " The file of a criminal . James diGriz , a.k.a . The Stainless Steel Rat . " The rubbery lips twisted into a poor imitation of a smile . " Stainless no more , rusty if any-thing . " He wheezed happily at his feeble joke , until smile turned to snarl . " I get them all , Rusty Rat . In the end they all end up before Warden Sukks . They run and hide  --  but finally I get them . Even the smartest criminal grows old , grows dim , makes one mistake . That 's all it takes to get caught and sent to Terminal Penitentiary . That 's the official name . But do you know what they really call it ... ? "  | " Hell 's Waiting Room ! " Unwanted , the words slipped from my lips and dropped greasily to the floor . " You got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . You come in but you do n't go out . In here we do n't use that fancy name . We have a better one . This is the Purgy . That 's short for Purgatory if you do n't know . Which is a word that means ... " " I got ta go to the toilet , " I wheezed , legs crossed tightly . His sneer deepened . " That 's all you old crocks ever do . " He thumbed a button and the door squeaked open behind me . " Bogger will show you where the heads are . Then he 'll take you for your medical . We shall see that you keep fit , diGriz so that you can enjoy our hospitality for a nice long time . " His sadistic laughter followed me down the corridor . I ca n't say that I was overly impressed with the reception . Or the medical either . The burly , bored , and sadistic attendants stripped me naked , then slipped a flimsy gray smock over my scrawny bones . Then proceeded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring my mewling protests . Commenting offhandedly on the results . " Pin in that hip . Looks kind of old . " " Not as old as those plastic knee joints . This ancient crock has had a lot of mileage . " " The doc is really going to like this one . Spots on the lung . TB or black lung or something . " " Done yet ? " Bogger asked , popping up like a bad memory . " Done . All yours , Bogger . Take him away . " Clutching my clothes to my chest , barefooted on the cold floor , I was dragged to my cell and pushed through the door . Despite my feeble resistance Bogger pulled my clothes from me , shook the few personal objects from my pockets onto the floor , threw onto the bed an armload of coarse prison clothing and a pair of scuffs . " Dinner at six . Door unlocks a minute before . If you 're late  | you do n't eat . " His sadistic chuckle was cut off by the closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face into my hands . Shivered . A sorry sight for anyone watching from any concealed pickups . The end of a proud , though criminal , man . A doomed nonagenarian reaching the end of his tether . What they could not see because my hands were over my face was the quick , happy , and successful grin . I had done it ! When I raised my face the grin was gone and my lips were trembling again . The transparent cover of my cheap plastic watch was so scratched that I could barely make out the numbers . I held it up to the light , twisted it and panted with the effort , finally made out the time . " Dinner at six , oh deary me . Must get out when the door unlocks . " I shuffled up to it just when the lock clicked open , pulled it wide , and stumbled through . It was pretty obvious where the chow hall was , with the feeble horde of gray-clad geriatric figures all shuffling in the same direction . I joined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out for dollops of institutional sludge . I could not tell what it was by looking at it , knew even less after I had tasted it . Well , hopefully it contained nourishment . I spooned it up with trembling hand . " I never seen you before , " the octogenarian seated beside me said suspiciously . " You a police spy ? " " I 'm a convicted felon . " " Welcome to Purgy , heh-hee , " he chuckled , cheered to see a newcomer . " Ever hijack a spaceship ? " " Once or twice . " " I did three . Third was a mistake . It was a decoy . But I ran out of credits , bad investments , nearing eighty and could n't see so well ... " The reminiscences droned on like a babbling brook and were just about as interesting . I let them burble while I finished  | my muckburger and gunge . As I was choking down the last depressing morsel a familiar and detested voice cut through the clatter and slurp . " Rusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rattle your ancient bones to see the doc . Now . " " How do I find him ? " " Follow the green arrows on the wall , numbnuts . The green ones with the little red cross . Go . " I dragged to my feet and went . There were arrows of different colors pointing in both directions on the corridor walls . I blinked and leaned close and made out the ones I needed . Lurched off to the left . " Come in , sit down , answer my questions , are you inconti-nent ? " The doctor was young , in a hurry , impatient . I scratched my head and muttered . " Do n't rightly know ... " " You must know ! " " Not really . Do n't know what the word means . " " Bed-wetting ! Do you wet the bed at night ? " " Only when I 'm drunk . " " Not much chance of that in here , diGriz . I 've been looking at your charts . You 're a wreck . Spots on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skull ? " " I led a rough life , Doc . " " Without a doubt . And your electrolytes are all skewed . I 'll give you a couple of shots now to slow the deterioration , then you take one of these pills three times a day . " I took the jar and blinked at the bullet-sized tablets . " Kind of big . " " And you 're kind of ill . Specially formulated for your multiple problems . Keep them with you at all times . A buzzer in the lid will tell you when to take one . Now  --  roll up your sleeve . " He wielded a wicked needle . I swear the point hit bone a couple of times . With aching arms I stumbled around looking  | for my room , got lost , got put right by passing attendants , finally found it . The door locked when I closed it and a few minutes later the lights began to dim . I fumbled off my clothes , fumbled on the sickly orange pajamas , dropped onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lights went out . This was it . End of the line . Purgy . The purgatory before hell . Fed and healed to make the stay that much longer . The sentence with only one end . Oh yeah ! I said silently to myself , and permitted a wide grin to brush my lips under the cover of the blankets . My back itched under the transparent plastic patches and I scratched them happily . They were invisible to the eye , but coated with a lead-antimony alloy that blocked X rays . I had gambled on the fact that this place would not have expensive tomographs or such and had won . On the two-dimensional X-ray plates the plastic patches on my legs looked like metal pins , on my skull dark staples . They had done their job , would dissolve and vanish the next time I washed . I had done it ! The first part of this operation was complete . Finding out about this hospital-prison had been the hardest part . It took a lot of risky work getting into planetary-government files before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guiding the twins in their successful semilegal careers had kept Angelina and me pretty busy . Now that they were successful , and rich I must add , we had been enjoying what might be called semiretirement . This suited Angelina quite well since she was happy with all those pleasure planets and luxury cruises . I , as you might very well imagine , loathed it . If I had n't been able to polish off the occasional bank or lift a lucrative space yacht I might have gone around the twist . But it was n't real work . Then this wonderful opportunity had revealed itself . A tiny item in the nightly news . I printed it out and brought it to Angelina . She read it swiftly , put it down in silence . " We ought to do something , " I had said .  | " No " was her quick response . " I think we owe him something  --  or at least you do . " " Nonsense . A grown man makes his own decisions . " " Yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sent him . " When I had tracked him down and discovered the secret location of Terminal Penitentiary , I told Angelina of my plan . Her eyes narrowed as I spoke , her face grew grim . When I had finished speaking she nodded slowly . " Do it , Jim . It is dangerous and looks suicidal  --  but you are probably the only man in the galaxy who could pull it off . With my help , of course . " " Of course . Your first task will be to find a bent but professionally competent doctor . " " Not a problem . Did you ever hear of a doctor  --  or a law-yer  --  bent or not , who could resist the continual flutter of bank notes onto a tabletop ? " " Now that you mention it  --  no . How is our expense ac-count ? " " Running a little low . We could use a few million more . Why do n't you knock off a really juicy bank while I line up the medic . " " Music to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preparations were complete . There would be no rushing in , guessing or taking chances . Because if every detail were not worked out to the last decimal point I was going to be spending an awful lot of time behind bars . Angelina came to pick me up at the clinic  --  and recoiled in horror . " Jim  --  you look awful ! " " Thank you . It was quite an effort . Losing weight was easy enough , as well as skin aging , hair dyeing , all the usual things . It 's the muscles I miss the most . " " Me too . Your gorgeous figure ? "  | " Wasted away with enzymes . No choice . If I am going to pass for an ancient crock I have to look like one . Do n't worry , a few months of bodybuilding when this is over and I 'll be as good as new . " A tear glistened in her eyes and she gave me a warm hug . " And you 're doing this for me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jim diGriz so I can look at myself in the mirror . Not that I really want to just now. , , And that had been that . Pulling off an inept jewel robbery and getting nicked had been the easy part . I just made sure that the crime was committed on Heliotrope-2 , the site of the original news report that had started this entire thing rolling . It had rolled well . Here I was in Purgy and I had one week to acquaint myself with the layout , the alarms and videoscanners , before the operation went into phase two . It was time well spent . At breakfast next morning I looked around at all the bald heads and gray polls of my fellow inmates and found him at once . And stayed away . Time enough to renew an old acquaintance at the proper moment . As I spooned up the purple gruel I took everything in . And started with surprise . Could it be him ? Yes , it was . His hair was white now , his face tracked with countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cave well , there are things you just do n't forget . I followed him after we had dumped our trays , sat down next to him in the morning room . " Been here long , Burin ? " I asked . He turned his head and blinked at me nearsightedly  --  then his face lit up with a smile . " Jimmy diGriz as I live and breathe ! " " And I 'm most glad that you are living and breathing ! Burin Bache , the best forger in the history of the galaxy . " " Kind of you to say that , Jimmy . And it was true at one time . Not lately ? " The smile faded and I quickly put my arm around him .  | " Do you still get chilblains in your ankles ? " " You bet I do ! You know  --  I still ca n't put ice into a drink . Hate the sight of it . " " Yes , but the ice cave was only a hiccup .... " " Some hiccup ! But you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauled down on that job I did n't have to work for ten years . You were young but you were a genius . Hate to see you ending up here like me . Never thought they would get you . " " Happens to the best of us . " As I spoke I had my stilo concealed in my cupped hands , printing a quick message on my palm . Then I rubbed my chin with the back of my hand and waited until Burin had looked at it , his eyes widening . " Got to go now , " I said as I blurred the message with a saliva-dampened fingertip . " See you around . " He could only nod shocked and silent agreement as I left . I could n't blame him . Since his incarceration I am sure he never thought he would ever read those words . WE 'RE GETTING OUT OF HERE . The immense bribe that Angelina had paid to the city official had been well worth it . The building permission floorplans had not been complete  --  but they sufficed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the second day , stuffed my stilo into the keyhole on the third . After being held in my armpit for an hour , the memory plastic of which it was made had softened to the consistency of clay . A moment after being pressed against the cold metal it had hardened into a perfect mirror image of the lock 's innards . We were permitted an hour in the garden every day and I had found a bench that was well away from any sites that might have held videoscanners . I sat there , apparently dozing over an open book . You would have to stand very close to see what I was doing . That morning I had stripped off part of the plastic covering of my battered wallet . And chewed it well . It had not tasted as  | bad as some of the meals we had consumed . It had reacted with my saliva and had softened to a nice doughy consistency . And had remained that way in the darkness of my pocket . Now I pressed it against the mold of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key that would open it . When I was satisfied with the effort I held the plastic in the warm sunshine . The catalyst it contained reacted with the light and it hardened instantly . Logically I should have waited for the right moment to try to open that door . But I had to make a dry run . Get any problems out of the way so I could move quickly and smoothly at the decided time . Burin was more than happy to help . We synchronized watches and at the precise moment I reached the door he stumbled and fell onto the table where the card game was in progress . There was a great crashing , shouts of anger and dismay as I slipped the homemade key into the keyhole . Turned and pressed . Nothing happened . I took a deep breath , held it then used every iota of skill acquired during a lifetime of lockpicking . It grated slightly  --  and the door opened . I was through in an instant , closing and locking it behind me . Listening for footsteps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look around me . I was in a small storeroom piled high with reams of paper and mounds of forms so dear to the bureaucratic heart . There was enough light from the small window to see clearly . I memorized the layout of the room , then moved one box that blocked a direct path . Enough . Time to go . I was too close to D Day , H Hour , M Minute to get into any trouble now . Silence in the hall . Through the door , lock it , stroll back to the morning room , where a sort of antique fistfight was going on . I was sorry we had to spoil their game . No , I really was n't . Burin glanced in my direction and I flashed him a sort of conspiratorial wink , or tic , then passed on .  | Angelina and I had agreed on absolutely minimum contact this first meeting . And the timing was crucial . It had to be after dark for concealment but not so late that we had been packed off beddy-byes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after dinner , stumbling swiftly in the direction of the heads . Past that door and up the stairs . I had cut it too close , only seconds left . Lock and relock the door , tread quickly the few steps along the memorized path my watch ready in my hand . Grasped in both hands so I could draw the watch strap back and forth across the window lock with a quick sawing motion . This stripped away the surface plastic that covered the far harder plasteel of the flexible saw inside . It rasped noisily until there was a sharp click . I stuffed the watch into my pocket , seized the window , and pulled it open . Angelina , all in black , black gloves and blackened face , was outside . She pushed the package into my hands . Despite our agreement she could not resist a softly hissed " About time ! " as I pushed the window shut . I retired at once , the bundle concealed in my clothing , pushed under the pillow as I got into bed . I left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Soon after the lights were out I began to toss and turn . " Ca n't sleep , " I moaned . " Insomnia and arthritis got me down . Groan . " I thrashed a bit longer , then rose and stumbled about the room rubbing my leg . Rubbing the controls on the detector as well with gratifying results . There was only a single detector over the door . Which left at least two blank spots in the room out of its field of view . A good night 's sleep was now in order , because there was plenty to do on the morrow . It was almost noon before I went looking for Burin Bache , sat down next to him in the sun porch . He raised his eyebrows quizzically but I did not respond until I had moved about a bit with the detector .  | " Great , " I said . " Just do n't talk too loud . Contact has been made . " " Then you have everything ? " He was trembling with excite-ment . " Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Let 's go out into the garden in exactly twelve minutes . " " Why ? " " Because concealed in my mouth is an optical laser commu-nicator . " I opened my lips to reveal the lens . " I can hear through my hard palate . " " Hear what ? " He was mystified . " The dulcet tones of my dear Angelina , who even now is making her way to the upper floors of that office building that you can just see peeking over the wall in the distance . Untappable communication . Let 's go . " I leaned back in the deck chair and at the proper moment smiled in the direction of the distant building . My aim did n't have to be too precise since she would have opened up a two-meter receiving lens . " Good morning , my love . " " Jim , I 'm sorry we ever got involved with this insane plan , " her voice said squeakily through my head bones . " Only way out now is full steam ahead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your building even with molecular grappling gloves and boots . " " But you did it , my love . You are strong and skillful ? " " If you dare add  --  for a woman of my age  --  I will skin you alive when you get out ! " " The farthest thought from my mind . What I wanted to ask is  --  do you think we can take out two instead of one ? I have found an old acquaintance here who , truthfully , saved my life once . In an ice cave . I 'll tell you about it one day . How about it ? " She hesitated a moment and I could imagine her sweet little  | frown of concentration . My Angelina does not speak until she is certain . " Yes , of course . I 'll just have to change transportation . " " Good . If you are changing transportation make sure the vehicle is big enough . " " For four ? " " Not really . What I had in mind was well , a figure a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Repeat last . It came through as sixty-five . " " Right ! Bang-on ! That is correct ! " I tried to sound cheerful and not smarmy . She was not fooled . " Do n't try it on , diGriz I know you . Sixty-five that must be every inmate there . " " Correct , my love . Exact number . I would suggest a tourist bus . I did this kind of thing once before and it worked . Locate the bus and I 'll get back to you same time tomorrow with more details . Must go  --  someone coming . " I clicked off . We were still unobserved but I wanted Angelina 's justified wrath to have twenty-four hours to cool before I talked to her again . " What happened ? " Burin asked . " I could hear you mumble a bit , that 's all . " " Gears meshing like clockwork . Could n't be better . My dear wife is filled with wild enthusiasm for the plan . Particularly its new dimension . " " What ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch now . Do n't drink the water . " " Why not ? " " I tested it this morning . Laced with pacifiers , saltpeter and brain-scrambling drugs . That 's why the inmates mumble and stagger around so much . I think almost all of them are in far better shape than what we see . " Angelina 's anger had cooled when we talked the next day . More than cooled . Her voice , even vibrating buzzily through  | my ear bones , had a positive chill that brought back memory of the ice cave . " I have the bus . Bought legally . What else will I need ? " " A bus driver 's uniform for yourself to explain your graceful presence behind the wheel . And , well  --  a few other items ? " " Like what ? " Temperature of liquid nitrogen . When I had dictated the list her voice was approaching absolute zero . " This is the most insane , harebrained , impossible plan that I have ever heard . I shall make every effort to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured and escape in one piece . So I can then personally kill you myself . " " My love you jest . " " Try me . " She clicked off . Maybe it was n't such a great idea . But now that I had started down this path I had to go all the way . For the first time I was more depressed than excited . Too much of the drinking water maybe . Then I remembered the medicine I had put into the bundle for just such a moment as this . Out of sight of the pickup above my door I opened the wall grate and removed the plastic bottle labeled DANGER  --  HIGH EXPLOSIVE . In a way it was . One hundred and ten proof and twelve years in the barrel . My good humor returned in a surge . For six more days Angelina and I had our daily chat by laser . Formal and brief no matter how I tried to be friendly and crack the occasional joke . All this was ignored . My darling was in a temper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do was get on with it . On the seventh day our conversation was most one-sided . She spoke a single word and disconnected . I turned off the transmitter with my tongue and turned to Burin who looked much more alert now that he was n't drinking water with his meals . " The date is set . " " When ? "  | " I 'll tell you after dinner . " He started to speak  --  then clamped his mouth shut . Appreciating the wisdom of my decision . The fewer that knew the less chance of any slipups . A maximum of one keeps a secret a secret . That evening when the rattle of spoons on metal had slowed and the slurping of the jellied gray dessert had replaced it , I took my tray into the kitchen , came out without it , and closed the door . Was watched by some of the slurpers with blearyeyed interest as I slipped a tiny metal packet over the cable to the pickup on the wall . " May I have your attention , " I called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I waited until the hum of voices had died down then pointed to the side door . " We are all going to leave now by that side door . The gentleman who is now opening it , Burin Bache , is your guide . You will follow him . " I had to raise my voice to be heard over the babble of voices . " You will shut up now and ask no questions . All will be revealed later . But I can tell you now that the authorities will definitely not like what we are going to do . " This drew nods of approval since every inmate was here because of flouting the law and thumbing the nose at authority . This , plus all the hypnotics in the drinking water , had them trooping out quietly following my orders . I stood by the door , smiling and patting an occasional shoulder as they went by , working hard not to show any impatience . With each passing minute there was a growing chance that the mass escape might be discovered . The kitchen staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall pickup was transmitting a recording of happy diners munching away . And the two other doors were locked . That was the weak spot in the plan . Normally no one came into the dining area during a meal . But there were exceptions . I crossed my  | fingers behind my back hoping that this was n't one of the exceptional days . As the last bent shoulder moved by in front of me I sighed with relief , stepped through , and locked the door behind me . Followed my shuffling colleagues down the stairs to the service corridor , closing and locking each door after going through it . I did the same thing as we passed through the cellar , to the boiler room at the far end . The fire door here was heavier and slid closed with a satisfactory thud . I turned to look at my colleagues , wringing my hands with pleasure . " What 's happening ? " one of them called out . " We are leaving here , " I looked at my watch , " In exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that caused no little stir . I listened to the voices then shouted them to silence . " No  --  I 'm not mad . Nor am I as old as I look . I had myself arrested and incarcerated in this place for only one reason . To crack out . I will now pass through you , that 's it , move aside , thank you , to the far wall . You may or may not know that this prison is built on a hillside . Which means that while the other end of the building is deep in the earth and rock  --  this end is level with the road outside . Will you all kindly move to the far side of the room , that 's it . As you can see I am placing a shaped charge of macrothermite on the wall . When ignited this not only burns but penetrates and keeps on burning until it reaches the other side . " They watched in tense silence as I patted into place a rough circle of the doughy substance , then sprayed it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together  --  get as far away as you can , " I ordered , looking at my watch . When there were five seconds to go I pushed the igniter button and hurried to join them . It was most dramatic . The igniter flared and a ring of fire sprang out from the wall . It crackled and flamed and smoked ;  | there was a lot of coughing as the smoke spread and the vent fans labored to clear it . Then I pulled the hose from the reel and opened the valve to spray water on the wall . There were cries of fear and more serious coughing as clouds of steam added to the discomfort . The hissing and crackling died down and I turned off the water , strode forward . I raised my foot and gave a good push against the circle of wall . It obliged me by falling outward with a rumbling crash . " Lights out ! " I ordered , and Burin threw the switches . A streetlight lit up the ground outside , revealed the roll of carpeting . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening . The carpet was red as I had ordered . " Let 's get out of here ! One at a time . No talking and do n't touch the wall or the ground . Stay on the carpet , which is heatproof . Burin  --  over here . " " It 's working , Jim it 's actually working ! " " Your faith is touching . Make sure they are all out before you leave . " " Will do ! " I joined the line of shambling figures , hurried along the carpet , and jumped off to join the neatly uniformed figure of my wife . " My love " " Shut up , " she suggested . " There 's the bus . Get them aboard . " There it was indeed . Engine idling , coachwork gleaming . A large banner on the side bore the message RETIREES MYSTERY TOUR " This way , " I said and turned the nearest man in the right direction and led the way to the door . " Go to the rear and find a seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seat  --  and the wig as well . Go . "  | I repeated this until Burin appeared . He took over the message muttering while I herded the remainder aboard . Angelina climbed in as well and sat in silence in the driver 's seat . " That 's the lot , " I said as cheerfully as I could . " Door closed and we 're away ! I did this once before , years ago , only with bicycles . " I turned and nodded approval at the gray wigs and dresses , at what appeared to be a busload of old ladies . " Well done , " I shouted . " Very well done . " And that was very well that . Other than my wife 's cold silence everything was just about perfect . We rolled merrily into the night and were well out of the city before we saw a police checkpoint ahead . I struggled into a dress , popped on the wig , then led all the assembled ladies in a sing-song of " Row , row , row your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we were told to move on . There was many a high-pitched shriek of joy and a flutter of waved handkerchiefs as we left . It was almost midnight before the headlights lit up the sign BIDE-A-WEE RETIREMENT HOME FOR GENTEEL LADIES . I jumped out and opened the gate , then closed it behind the bus . " Inside , ladies , " I called out . " Tea and cakes waiting  --  as well as a self-service bar . " This last drew shouts of hoarse pleasure as they streamed inside , dresses and wigs now cast aside . Angelina signaled me over and I hurried to her side . " What do I say to him ? " " I thought you were angry with me ? " " That 's long past . It 's just ... " He stood aside from the others , saw us talking . Walked slowly over to join us . " I must thank you both  --  for what you have done for all of us . " It just worked out that way , Pepe , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing up to spring you out of that place . The operation sort of , well , grew a bit after that . " " Then you still remember me , Angelina ? I recognized you at once . " He smiled warmly and his eyes grew damp . " It was my idea , " I said quickly , before things got out of hand . " I saw this item in the news and felt obligated to do something . For old times ' sake at least . Since I was the one who arrested you for stealing the battleship . " " And I was the one who led you into a life of crime , " Angelina said firmly . " We felt a certain  --  responsibility . " " Particularly since we have been happily married for years and have two fine sons . If you two had not been partners I would have never met the light of my life , " I added to make sure all the ground rules were known . Pepe Nero nodded and knuckled his eye . " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So it all comes out even in the end . I think I was always suited for crime , Angelina . You just set my foot on the right road . Now I am going to have a really large drink . " " That is a really great idea , " I agreed . " A toast ! " Burin called out . " Jim and Angelina  --  our saviors . Thanks for life ! " Cups and glasses were raised  --  as well as a hoarse cheer from all present . I put my arm around her waist and this time it was I who had the tear in my eye
