EVEN NOW WHEN I THINK of my brother Bubba , he appears instantly just as he was then , rising up before me in the very flesh , grinning that one-sided grin , pushing his cowlick back out of his tawny eyes , thumbs hooked in the loops of his wheat jeans , Bass weejuns held together with electrical tape , leaning against his little green MGB . John Leland Christian III  --  Bubba  --  in the days of his glory , Dartmouth College , c. 1965 . Brilliant , Phi Beta Kappa his junior year . The essence of cool . The essence not only of cool but of bad , for Bubba was a legendary wild man in those days ; and while certain facts in his legend varied , this constant remained : Bubba would do anything . Anything . <p> I was a little bit in love with him myself . <p> I made Bubba up in the spring of 1963 in order to increase my popularity with my girlfriends at a small women 's college in Virginia . I was a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was ill at ease among them : a thistle in the rose garden , a mule at the racetrack , Cinderella at the fancy dress ball Take your pick  --  I was into images then . More than anything else in the world , I wanted to be a writer . I did n't want to learn to write , of course . I just wanted to be a writer , and I often pictured myself poised at the foggy edge of a cliff someplace in the south of France , wearing a cape , drawing furiously on a long cigarette , hollow-cheeked and haunted , trying to make up my mind between two men . Both of them wanted me desperately . <p> But in fact I was Charlene Christian , a chunky size 12 , plucked up from a peanut farm near South Hill , Virginia , and set down in those exquisite halls through the intervention of my senior English teacher , Mrs. Bella Hood , the judge 's wife , who had graduated from the school herself . I had a full scholarship . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate from college unless you counted my Aunt Dee , who got her certificate from the beauty college in Richmond . I was not going to count Aunt Dee . I was not even going to mention her in later years , or anybody else in my family . I intended to grow beyond them . I intended to become a famous hollow-cheeked author , with mysterious origins . <p> But this is the truth . I grew up in McKenney , Va. , which consisted of nothing more than a crossroads with my father 's store in the middle of it . I used to climb up on the tin roof of our house and turn slowly all around , scanning the horizon , looking for .. , what ? I found nothing of any interest , just fiat brown peanut fields that stretched out in every direction as far as I could see , with a farmhouse here and there . I knew who lived in every house . I knew everything about them and about their families , what kind of car they drove and where they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not that there was much to know . My father , Hassell Christian , would give you the shirt off his back , and everybody knew it . At the store , he 'd extend credit indefinitely to people down on their luck , and he let some families live in his tenant houses for free . Our own house adjoined the store . <p> My mother 's younger brother Sam , who lived with us , was what they then called a Mongoloid . Some of the kids at school referred to him as a " Mongolian idiot . " Now the preferred term is Down syndrome . My uncle Sam was sweet , small , and no trouble at all . I played cards with him endlessly , all the summers of my childhood  --  Go Fish , rummy , Old Maid , Hearts , blackjack . Sam loved cards and sunshine and his cat , Blackie . He liked to sit on a quilt in the sun , playing cards with me . He liked to sit on the front porch with Blackie and watch the cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . <p> My mother , who was high-strung , was always fussing around after Sam , making him pick up paper napkins and turn off the TV and put his shoes in a line . My mother had three separate nervous breakdowns before I went away to college . My father always said we had to " treat her with kid gloves . " In fact , when I think about it now , I am surprised that my mother was ever able to hold herself together long enough to conceive a child at all , or come to term . After me , there were two miscarriages , and then , I was told , they " quit trying . " I was never sure what this meant , exactly . But certainly I could never imagine my parents having a sexual relationship in the first place  --  he was too fat and gruff , she was too fluttery and crazy . The whole idea was gross . <p> Whenever my mother had a nervous breakdown , my grandmother , Memaw , would come over from next door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to South Hill to stay with my Aunt Dee and my little cousins . I loved my Aunt Dee , as different from Mama as day from night . Aunt Dee wore her yellow hair in a beehive and smoked Pall Mall cigarettes . After work she 'd come in the door , kick off her shoes , put a record on the record player , and dance all over the living room to " Ooh-Poo-PaDoo . " She said it " got the kinks out . " She taught us all to do the shag , even little Tammy . <p> I was always sorry when my dad appeared in his truck , ready to take me back home . <p> When I think of home now , the image which comes most clearly to mind is my whole family lined up in the flickering darkness of our living room , watching TV . We never missed the Ed Sullivan Show , Bonanza , the Andy Griffith Show , or Candid Camera  --  Sam 's favorite . Sam used to laugh and laugh when they 'd say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only time my family ever did anything together . I can just see us now in the light from that black and white Zenith TV , lined up on the couch ( me , Sam , Memaw ) , with Daddy and Mama in the recliner and the antique wing chair , respectively , facing the television . We always turned off all the lights in order to watch TV , and sat quietly , and did n't eat anything . <p> No wonder I got a boyfriend with a car as soon as possible , to get out of there . Don Fetterman had a soft brown crewcut and wide brown eyes and reminded me , in the nicest possible way , of the cows which he and his family raised . Don was president of the 4-H Club and the Tri-Hi-Y Club . I was vice president of the Tri-Hi-Y Club ( how we met ) and president of the Glee Club . We were both picked as " Most Likely to Succeed . " <p> We rubbed our bodies together at innumerable dances in tile high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Twelfth of Never "  --  but we never , never went all the way . Don would n't . He believed we should save ourselves for marriage . I , on the other hand , having read by this time a great many novels , was just dying to lose my virginity so that I would mysteriously begin to " live , " so that my life would finally start . I knew for sure that I would never become a great writer until I could rid myself of this awful burden . But Don Fetterman stuck to his guns , refusing to cooperate . Instead , for graduation , he gave me a pearl " preengagement " ring , which I knew for a fact had cost $139.00 at Snows Jewelers in South Hill , where I worked after school and on weekends . This was a lot of money for Don Fetterman to spend . <p> Although I did n't love him , by then he thought I did ; and after I got the ring , I did n't have the nerve to tell him the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye for hours and hours the night before he went off to join the Marines . My tears were real at this point , but after he left I relegated him firmly to the past . Ditto my whole family . Once I got to college , I was determined to become a new person . <p> Luckily my freshman roommate turned out to be a kind of prototype , the very epitome of a popular girl . The surprise was that she was nice , too . Dixie Claiborne came from Memphis , where she was to make her debut that Christmas at the Swan Ball . She had long , perfect blond hair , innumerable cashmere sweater sets , and real pearls . She had lots of friends already , other girls who had gone to St. Cecilia 's with her ( at first it seemed to me a good two-thirds of all the girls at school had gone to Saint Something-or-other ) . They had a happy ease in the world and a strangely uniform appearance which I immediately began to copy-spending my whole semester 's money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several A-line skirts , McMullen blouses , and a pair of red Pappagallo shoes . Dixie had about a thousand cable-knit sweaters , which she was happy to lend me . In addition to all the right clothes , Dixie came equipped with the right boyfriend , already a sophomore at Washington and Lee University , the boys ' school just over the mountain . His name was Trey ( William Hill Dunn III ) . Trey would be just so glad , Dixie said , smiling , to get us all dates for the Phi Gain mixer . " All of us " included our whole suite  --  Dixie and me in the front room overlooking the old quadrangle with its massive willow oaks , Melissa and Donnie across the hall , and Lily in the single just beyond our little study room . <p> Trey fixed us up with several Phi Gains apiece , but nothing really clicked ; and in November , Melissa , Donnie , Lily , and I signed up to go to a freshman mixer at UVA . As our bus approached the university 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teasing our hair and checking our makeup . Looking into my compact , I pursed my lips in a way I 'd been practicing . Unfortunately I had a pimple near my nose , but I 'd turned it into a beauty spot by covering it up with eyebrow pencil . I hoped to look like Sandra Dee . <p> Freshman year , everybody went to mixers , where freshman boys , generally as ill at ease as we were , stood nervously about in the social rooms of their fraternity houses , wearing navy-blue blazers , ties , and chinos . Nobody really knew how to date in this rigid system so unlike high school  --  and certainly so unlike prep school , where many of these boys had been locked away for the past four years . If they could have gotten their own dates , they would have . But they could n't . They did n't know anybody either . They pulled at their ties and looked at the floor . They seemed to me generally gorgeous , entirely unlike Don Fetterman with his feathery crew cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I still wrote to Don , informative , stilted little notes about my classes and the weather . His letters in return were lively and real , full of military life ( " the food sucks " ) and vague sweet plans for our future  --  a future which did not exist , as far as I was concerned , and yet these letters gave me a secret thrill . My role as Don Fetterman 's girl was the most exciting role I 'd had yet ; and I could n't quite bring myself to give it up , even as I attempted to transform myself into another person altogether . <p> " Okay , " the upperclassman-in-charge announced casually , and the St. Anthony 's Hall pledges wandered over in our direction . <p> " Hey , " the cutest one said to a girl . <p> " Hey , " she said back . <p> The routine never varied . In a matter of minutes the four most aggressive guys would walk off with the four prettiest girls , and the rest of us would panic . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall was cleared in a matter of minutes , leaving me with a tall , gangly , bucktoothed boy whose face was as pocked as the moon . Still , he had a kind of shabby elegance I already recognized . He was from Mississippi . <p> " What do you want to do ? " he asked me . <p> I had not expected to be consulted , f glanced around the social room , which looked like a war zone . I did n't know where my friends were . <p> " What do you want to do ? " I asked . <p> His name ( his first name ) was Rutherford . He grinned at me . " Let 's get drunk , " he said , and my heart leaped up as I realized that my burden might be lifted in this way . We walked across the beautiful old campus to an open court where three or four fraternities had a combo started up already , wild-eyed electrified Negroes going through all kinds of gyrations on the bandstand . It was Doug Clark and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat so strong , that you could n't listen to it and stand still . The Hot Nuts were singing an interminable song ; everybody seemed to know the chorus , which went " Nuts , hot nuts , get ' era from the peanut man . Nuts , hot nuts , get ' era any way you can . " We started dancing . I always worried about this  --  all I 'd ever done before college , in the way of dancing , was the shag with my Aunt Dee and a long , formless clutch with Don Fetterman , but Rutherford was so wild it did n't matter . <p> People made a circle around us and started clapping . Nobody looked at me . All eyes were on Rutherford , whose dancing reminded me of the way chickens back home flopped around after Daddy cut their heads off . At first I was embarrassed . But then I caught on  --  Rutherford was a real character . I kept up with him as best I could , and then I got tickled and started laughing so hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized suddenly . This is what I 'm supposed to be doing . This is college . <p> About an hour later we heard the news , which was delivered to us by a tweed-jacketed professor who walked up on stage , bringing the music to a ragged , grinding halt . He grabbed the microphone . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he said thickly  --  and I remember thinking how odd this form of address seemed  --  " Ladies and gentlemen , the President has been shot . " <p> The whole scene started to churn , as if we were in a kaleidoscope-the blue day , the green grass , the stately columned buildings . People were running and sobbing . Rutherford 's hand under my elbow steered me back to his fraternity house , where everyone was clustered around several TV 's , talking too loud . All the weekend festivities had been canceled . We were to return to school immediately . Rutherford seemed relieved by this prospect , having fallen silent  --  perhaps because he 'd quit drinking , or because conversation alone was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) might be forthcoming . He gave me a perfunctory kiss on the cheek and turned to go . <p> I was about to board the bus when somebody grabbed me , hard , from behind . I whirled around . It was Lily , red-cheeked and glassy-eyed , her blond hair springing out wildly above her blue sweater . Her hotpink lipstick was smeared . Lily 's pretty , pointed face looked vivid and alive . A dark-haired boy stood close behind her , his arm around her waist . <p> " Listen , " Lily hissed at me . " Sign me in , will you ? " <p> " What ? " I had heard her , but I could n't believe it . <p> " Sign me in . " Lily squeezed my shoulder . I could smell her perfume . Then she was gone . <p> I sat in a back seat by myself and cried all the way back to school . <p> I caught on fast that as far as college boys were concerned , girls fell into either the Whore or the Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did it , then boys would n't respect them , and word would get around , and they would never get a husband . The whole point of college was to get a husband . <p> I had not known anything about this system before I got there . It put a serious obstacle in my path toward becoming a great writer . <p> Lily , who had clearly given up her burden long since , fell into the Whore category . But the odd thing about it was that she did n't seem to mind , and she swore she did n't want a husband anyway . " Honey , a husband is the last thing on my list ! " Lily 'd say , giggling . Lily was the smartest one of us all , even though she went to great lengths to hide this fact . Later , in 1966 , Lily and the head of the philosophy department , Dr. Wiener , would stage the only demonstration ever held on our campus ; they walked slowly around the blooming quadrangle carrying signs that read Get Out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunning on the rooftops , clutched our bikini tops and peered down curiously at the two of them . <p> If Lily was the smartest , Melissa was clearly the dumbest , the nicest , and the least interested in school . Melissa came from Charleston , S.C. , and spoke so slowly that I was always tempted to leap in and finish her sentences for her . All she wanted to do was marry her boyfriend , now at the University of South Carolina , and have babies . Donnie , Melissa 's roommate , was a big , freckled , friendly girl from Texas . We did n't have any idea how rich she was until her mother flew up and bought a cabin at nearby Goshen Lake so Donnie and her friends would have a place to " relax . " <p> By spring , Dixie was the only one of us who was actually pinned . It seemed to me that she was not only pinned but almost married , in a funny way , with tons and tons of children  --  Trey , her boyfriend ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suite ; and all the other Phi Cams , Trey 's fraternity brothers at Washington and Lee . Dixie had a little book in which she made a list of things to do each day , and throughout the day she checked them off one by one . She always got all of them done . At the end of first semester she had a 4.0 average ; Trey had a .4 . Dixie just smiled . Totally , inexplicably , she loved him . <p> By then most of the freshman girls who were n't going with somebody had several horror stories to tell about blind dates at UVA or W &L; fraternities  --  boys who " dropped trou , " or threw up in their dates ' purses . I had only one horror story , but I never told it , since the most horrible element in it was me . <p> This is what happened . It was " Spring Fling " at the Phi Gam house , and Trey had gotten me a date with a red-headed boy named Eddy Turner . By then I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first semester of creative writing , while Lily had made an A. Plus , I 'd gained 8 pounds . Both love and literature seemed to be slipping out of my sights . And I was drinking too much  --  we 'd been drinking Yucca Flats , a horrible green punch made in a washtub with grain alcohol , all afternoon on the night I ended up in bed with Eddy Turner . <p> The bed was his , on the second floor of the Phi Gam house  --  not the most private setting for romance . I could scarcely see Eddy by the streetlight coming in through the single high window . Faintly , below , I could hear music , and the whole house shook slightly with the dancing . I thought of Hemingway 's famous description of sex from For Whom the Bell Tolls , which I 'd typed out neatly on an index card : " The earth moved under the sleeping bag . " The whole Phi Gam house was moving under me . After wrestling with my panty girdle for what seemed like hours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of me immediately . Drunk as I was , I wanted him to . I wanted him to do it . But I did n't think it would hurt so much , and suddenly I wished he would kiss me or say something . He did n't . He was done and lying on his back beside me when suddenly the door to the room burst open and the lights came on . I sat up , grasping for the sheet which I could n't find . My breasts are large , and they had always embarrassed me . Until that night , Don Fetterman was the only boy who had ever seen them . It was a whole group of Phi Gams , roaming from room to room . Luckily I was blinded by the lights , so I could n't tell exactly who they were . <p> " Smile ! " they yelled . " You 're on Candid Camera ! " Then they laughed hysterically , slammed the door , and were gone , leaving us in darkness once again . But I was sobbing into Eddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose face would not leave my mind then for hours while I cried and cried and cried and sobered up . I did n't tell Eddy what I was crying about , nor did he ask . He sat in a chair and smoked cigarettes while he waited for me to stop crying . Finally I did . Eddy and I did n't date after that , but we were buddies in the way I was buddies with the whole Phi Gam house due to my particular status as Dixie 's roommate . I was like a sister , giving advice to the lovelorn , administering Cokes and aspirins on Sunday mornings , typing papers . <p> It was not the role I 'd had in mind , but it was better than nothing , affording me at least a certain status among the girls at school ; and the Phi Gams always saw to it that I attended all the big parties , usually with somebody whose girlfriend could n't make it . Often , when the weekend was winding down , I could be found down in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my favorite song , over and over on the jukebox . <p> preBlown by the windKissed by the snowAll that 's leftIs the dark below.Gone from me , Oh , oh.Trag-e-dy . It always brought me right to the edge of tears , because I had n't ever known any tragedy myself , or love , or drama . Would n't anything ever happen to me ? <p> Meanwhile , my friends ' lives were like soap opera  --  Lily 's period was two weeks late , which scared us all , and then Dixie went on the pill . Melissa and her boyfriend split up ( she lost 7 pounds , he slammed his hand into a wall ) and then made up again . <p> Melissa was telling us about it , in her maddening slow way , one day in May when we were all out at Donnie 's lake cabin , sunning . " It 's not the same , though , " Melissa said . " He just gets too mad . I do n't know what it is ; he scares me . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil with iodine in it , our suntan lotion of choice . <p> " But I love him , " Melissa wailed , and Lily snorted . <p> " Well , " Dixie began diplomatically , but suddenly I sat up . " Maybe he 's just got a wild streak , " I said . <p> " Maybe he just ca n't control himself . That 's always been Bubba 's problem . " Suddenly the little lake before us took on a deeper , more intense hue . I noticed the rotting pier , the old fisherman up at the point , Lily 's painted toenails . I noticed everything . <p> " Who 's Bubba ? " Donnie asked me . <p> Dixie eyed me expectantly , thinking I meant one of the Phi Gams , since several of them had that nickname . <p> " My brother , " I said . I took a deep breath . <p> " What ? You never said you had a brother ! " Dixie 's pretty face looked really puzzled now . <p> Everybody sat up and looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " He 's two years older than me , and he stayed with my father when my parents split up . So I 've never lived with him . In fact I do n't know him real well at all . This is very painful for me to talk about . We were inseparable when we were little , " I added , hearing my song in the back of my mind . " Oh , oh ... trag-e-dy ! " <p> " Oh , Charlene , I 'm so sorry ! I had no ideal " Dixie was hugging me , slick hot skin and all . <p> I started crying . " He was a real problem child , " I said , " and now he 's just so wild . I do n't know what 's going to become of him . " <p> " How long has it been since you 've seen him ? " Melissa asked . <p> " About two years , " I said . " Our parents wo n't have anything at all to do with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got remarried . They wo n't let us get together , not even for a day ; it 's just awful . " <p> " So how did you get to see him two years ago ? " Lily asked . They had all drawn closer , clustering around me . <p> " He ran away from school , " I said , " and came to my high school , and got me right out of class . I remember it was biology lab , " I said . " I was dissecting a frog . " <p> " Then what ? " <p> " We spent the day together , " I said . " We got some food and went out to this quarry and ate , and just drove around . We talked and talked , " I said . " And you know what ? I felt just as close to him then as I did when we were babies . Just like all those years had never passed at all . It was great , " I said . <p> " Then he went back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I choked back a sob . " It was almost dark , and he was taking me back to my house , and then he was planning to head on down to Florida , he said , when all of a sudden these blue lights came up behind us , and it was the police . " <p> " The police ? " Dixie looked really alarmed then . She was such a good girl . <p> " Well , it was a stolen car , of course , " I explained . " They nailed him . If he had n't stopped in to see me , he might have gotten away with it , " I said , " if he 'd just headed straight to Florida . But tie came to see me . Mama and Daddy would n't even bail him out . They let him go straight to prison . " <p> " Oh Charlene , no wonder you never talk about your family ! " Dixie was in tears now . <p> " But he was a model prisoner , " I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave all the prisoners this test , and he scored the highest that anybody in the whole history of the prison had ever scored , so they let him take these special classes , and he did so well that he got out a whole year early , and now he 's in college . " <p> " Where ? " <p> I thought fast . " Dartmouth , " I said wildly . I knew it had to be a Northern school , since Dixie and Melissa seemed to know everybody in the South . But neither of them , as far as I could recall , had ever mentioned Dartmouth . <p> " He 's got a full scholarship , " I added . " But he 's so wild , I do n't know if he 'll be able to keep it or not . " Donnie got up and went in and came back with cold Cokes for us all , and we stayed out at Goshen Lake until the sun set , and I told them all about Bubba . <p> He was a KA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , he got drunk and passed out in the snow on the way back to his fraternity house ; by the time a janitor found him the following morning , his cheek was frozen solid to the road . It took two guys from maintenance , with electrical torches , to melt the snow around Bubba 's face and get him loose . And now the whole fraternity was on probation because of this really gross thing he 'd made the pledges do . " What really gross tiling ? " they asked . " Oh , you do n't want to know , " I said . " You really do n't . " <p> " I really do , " Lily insisted , pushing her sunburnt face into mine . " Come on . After Trey , nothing could be that bad . " Even Dixie grinned . <p> " Okay , " I said , launching into a hazing episode which required the KA pledges to run up three flights of stairs , holding alum in their mouths . On each landing they had to dodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the alum during the struggle , well , alum makes you vomit immediately , so you can imagine .. , they could imagine . But the worst part was that when one pledge would n't go past the second landing , the football players threw him down the stairs , and he broke his back . <p> " That 's just disgusting , " Donnie drawled . " Nobody would ever do that in Texas . " <p> But on the other hand , I said quickly , Bubba was the most talented poet in the whole school , having won the Iris Nutley Leach Award for Poetry two years in a row . I pulled the name " Iris Nutley Leach " right out of the darkening air . I astonished myself . And girls were just crazy about Bubba , I added . In fact this girl from Washington tried to kill herself after they broke up , and then she had to be institutionalized for a year , at Shepherd-Pratt in Baltimore . I knew all about Shepherd-Pratt because my mother had gone there . <p> " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . Everyone sighed , and a warm breeze came up over the pines and ruffled our little lake . By then Bubba was as real to me as the Peanuts towel I sat on , as the warm , gritty dirt between my toes . <p> During the next year or so , Bubba would knock up a girl and then nobly help her get an abortion ( Donnie offered to contribute ) ; he would make Phi Beta Kappa ; he would be arrested for assault ; he would wreck his MGB ; he would start writing folk songs . My creativity knew no bounds when it came to Bubba , but I was a dismal failure in my first writing class where my teacher , Mr. Lefcowicz , kept giving me B 's and C 's and telling me , " Write what you know . " <p> I did n't want to write what I knew , of course . I had no intention of writing a word about my own family or those peanut fields . Who would want to read about that ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own life . I could n't give up that tormented woman on the cliff in the south of France . I intended to write about glamorous heroines with exciting lives ; one of my first  --  and worst  --  stories involved a stewardess in Hawaii . I had never been to Hawaii , of course . At that time , I had never even been on a plane . The plot , which was very complicated , had something to do with international espionage . I remember how kindly my young teacher smiled at me when he handed my story back . He asked me to stay for a minute after class . " Charlene , " he said , " I want you to write something true next time . " <p> Instead , I decided to give up on plot and concentrate on theme , intending to pull some heartstrings . It was nearly Christmas , and this time we had to read our stories aloud to the whole group . But right before that class , Mr. Lefcowicz , who had already read them , pulled me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read my story out loud if I did n't want to . <p> " Of course I want to , " I said . We took our seats . <p> My story took place in a large unnamed city on Christmas Eve . In this story , a whole happy family was trimming their Christmas tree , singing carols , and drinking hot chocolate while it snowed outside . I think I had " softly falling flakes . " Each person in the family got to open one present  --  selected from the huge pile of gifts beneath the glittering tree  --  before bed . Then they all went to sleep , and a " pregnant silence " descended . At three o'clock a fire broke out , and the whole house burned to the ground , and they all burned up , dying horrible deaths which I described individually  --  conscious , as I read aloud , of some movement and sound among my listeners . But I did n't dare look up as I approached the story 's ironic end : " When the fire trucks arrived , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music box in the smoking ashes , softly playing ' Silent Night . ' " By the end of my story , one girl had put her head down on her desk ; another was having a coughing fit . Mr. Lefcowicz was staring intently out the window at the wintry day , his back to us . Then he made a sudden show of looking at his watch . " Whoops ! Class dismissed ! " he cried , grabbing up his bookbag . He rushed from the room like the White Rabbit , already late . <p> But I was not that stupid . <p> As I walked across the cold , wet quadrangle toward our dormitory , I understood perfectly well that my story was terrible , laughable . I wanted to die . The gray sky , the dripping , leafless trees , fit my mood perfectly , and I suddenly remembered Mr. Lefcowicz saying , in an earlier class , that we must never manipulate nature to express our characters ' emotions . " Ha , " I muttered scornfully to the heavy sky . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus newspaper . I became its editor in the middle of my sophomore year  --  a job nobody else wanted , a job I really enjoyed . I had found a niche , a role , and although it was not what I had envisioned for myself , it was okay . Thus I became the following things : editor of the newspaper ; member of Athena , the secret honor society ; roommate of Dixie , the May Queen ; friend of Phi Gains ; and  --  especially  --  sister of Bubba , whose legend loomed ever larger . But I avoided both dates and creative writing classes for the next two years , finding Mr. Lefcowicz 's stale advice , " Write what you know , " more impossible with each visit home . <p> The summer between my sophomore and junior years was the hardest . The first night I was home , I realized that something was wrong with Mama when I woke up to hear water splashing in the downstairs bathroom . I got up and went to investigate . There she was , wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green tile tub . <p> " Oh , hi , Charlene ! " she said brightly , and went on scrubbing , humming tunelessly to herself . A mop and bucket stood in the corner . I said good night and went back to my bedroom , where I looked at the clock : it was 3:30 A.M. <p> The next day Mama burst into tears when Sam spilled a glass of iced tea , and the day after that Daddy took her over to Petersburg and put her in the hospital . Memaw came in to stay with Sam during the day while I worked in the jewelers at South Hill , my old job . <p> I 'd come home at suppertime each afternoon to find Sam in his chair on the front porch , holding Blackie , waiting for me . He seemed to have gotten smaller somehow  --  and for the first time , I realized that Sam , so much a part of my childhood , was not growing up along with me . In fact he would never grow up , and I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung gently in the porch swing , back and forth through the sultry air , suspended . <p> In August I went to Memphis for a week to visit Dixie , whose house turned out to be like Tara in Gone With the Wind , only bigger , and whose mother turned out to drink sherry all day long . I came back to find Mama out of the hospital already , much improved by shock treatments , and another surprise  --  a baby-blue Chevrolet convertible , used but great-looking , in the driveway . My father handed me the keys . <p> " Here , honey , " he said , and then he hugged me tight , smelling of sweat and tobacco . " We 're so proud of you , " he said . He had traded a man a combine or something for the car . <p> So I drove back to school in style , and my junior year went smoothly until Donnie announced that her sister Susannah , now at Pine Mountain Junior College , was going up to Dartmouth for Winter Carnival , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could n't wait to look up Bubba . <p> Unfortunately , this was not possible , as I got a phone call that very night saying that Bubba had been kicked out of school for leading a demonstration against the war . Lily , who had become much more political herself by that time , jumped up from her desk and grabbed my hand . <p> " Oh , no ! " she shrieked . " He 'll be drafted ! " and the sudden alarm that filled our study room was palpable  --  as real as the mounting body count each night on TV  --  as we stared , Lily and Dixie and Donnie and I , white-faced at each other . <p> " Whatever will he do now ? " Donnie was wringing her hands . <p> " I do n't know , " I said desperately . " I just do n't know . " I went to my room  --  a single , this term  --  and thought about it . It was clear that he would have to do something , something to take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was soon to be superseded by Melissa 's . She was pregnant , really pregnant , and in spite of all the arguments we could come up with , she wanted to get married and have the baby . She wanted to have lots of babies , and one day live in the big house on the Battery which her boyfriend would inherit , and this is exactly what she 's done . Her life has been predictable and productive . So violent in his college days , Melissa 's husband turned out to be a model of stability in later life . And their first child , Anna , kept him out of the draft . As she got in her mother 's car to leave , Melissa squeezed my hand <p> and said , " Keep me posted about Bubba , and do n't worry so much . I 'm sure everything will work out all right . <p> " It did n't . <p> Bubba burned his draft card not a month later and headed for Canada , where he lived in a commune . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all tangled up as I was by then in my affair with Dr. Pierce . <p> Dr. Pierce was a fierce , bleak , melancholy man who looked like a bird of prey . Not surprisingly , he was a Beckett scholar . He taught the seminar in contemporary literature which I took in the spring of my junior year . We read Joseph Heller , Kurt Vonnegut , Flannery O'Connor , John Barth , and Thomas Pynchon , among others . Flannery O'Connor would become my favorite , and I would do my senior thesis on her work , feeling a secret and strong kinship , by then , with her dire view . But this was later , after my affair with Dr. Pierce was over . <p> At first , I did n't know what to make of him . I hated his northern accent , his lugubrious , glistening dark eyes , his all-encompassing pessimism . He told us that contemporary literature was absurd because the world was absurd . He told us that the language in these books was weird and fractured because true communication is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this in a sad , cynical tone full of infinite world-weariness , which I found both repellent and attractive . <p> Finally I decided to go in and talk to him . I am still not sure why I did this  --  I was making good grades in his course , I understood everything . But one blustery , unsettling March afternoon I found myself sitting outside his office . He was a popular teacher , rumored to be always ready to listen to his students ' problems . I do n't know what I meant to talk to him about . The hour grew late . Shadows lengthened in the hall I smoked four or five cigarettes while other students , ahead of me , went in and came out . Then Dr. Pierce came and stood in the door . He took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes . He looked tired , but not nearly as old as he looked in class , where he always wore a tie . Now he wore jeans and an old blue workshirt , and I could see the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in that way of his which rendered all his remarks oddly significant , although I could never figure out why . " Ah ! Miss Christian , is it not ? " <p> He knew it was . I felt uncomfortable , like he was mocking me . He made a gesture ; I preceded him into his office and sat down . <p> " Now , " he said , staring at me . I looked away , out the window at the skittish , blowing day , at the girls who passed by on the walkway , giggling and trying to hold their skirts down . " Miss Christian , " Dr. Pierce said . Maybe he 'd said it before . Finally I looked at him . <p> " I presume you had some reason for this visit , " he said sardonically . <p> To my horror , I started crying . Not little ladylike sniffles , either , but huge groaning sobs . Dr. Pierce thrust a box of Kleenex in my direction , then sat drumming his fingers on his desk . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drumming : the William Tell Overture . I got tickled . Soon I was crying and laughing at the same time . I was still astonished at myself . <p> " Blow your nose , " Dr. Pierce said . <p> I did . <p> " That 's better , " he said . It was . He got up and closed his office door although there was really no need to do so , since the hall outside was empty now . Dr. Pierce sat back down and leaned across his desk toward me . " What is it ? " he asked intently . <p> But I still did n't know what it was . I said so , and apologized . " One thing though , " I said , " I 'd like to complain about the choice of books on our reading list . " <p> " Aha ! " Dr. Pierce said . He leaned back in his chair and made his fingers into a kind of tent . " You liked Eudora Welty , " he said . This was true ; I nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . I nodded again . <p> " But I just hate this other stuff ! " I burst out . " I just hated The End of the Road , I hated it ! It 's so depressing . " <p> He nodded rapidly . " You think literature should make you feel good ? " he asked . <p> " It used to , " I said . Then I was crying again . I stood up . " I 'm so sorry , " I said . <p> Dr. Pierce stood up too and walked around his desk and came to stand close to me . The light in his office was soft , gray , furry . Dr. Pierce took both my hands in his . " Oh , Miss Christian , " he said . " My very dear , very young Miss Christian , I know what you mean . " And I could tell , by the pain and weariness in his voice , that this was true . I could see Dr. Pierce suddenly as a much younger man , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different feeling about the world . I reached up and put my hands in his curly hair and pulled his face down to mine and kissed him fiercely , a way I had never kissed anybody . I could n't even imagine myself doing this , yet I did it naturally . Dr. Pierce kissed me back . We kissed for a king time while it grew finally dark outside , and then he locked the door and turned back to me . He sighed deeply  --  almost a groan  --  a sound , I felt , of regret , then unbuttoned my shirt . We made love on the rug on his office floor . Immediately we were caught up in a kind of fever that lasted for several months  --  times like these in his office after hours , or in the backseat of my car parked by the lake , or in cheap motels when I 'd signed out to go home . <p> Nobody suspected a thing . I was as good at keeping secrets as I was at making up lies . Plus , I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . <p> He tried to end it that June . I was headed home , and he was headed up to New York where he had some kind of fellowship to do research at the Morgan Library . <p> " Charlene  --  " Dr. Pierce said . We were in public , out on the quadrangle right after graduation . His wife walked down the hill at some distance behind us , with other faculty wives . Dr. Pierce 's voice was hoarse , the way it got when he was in torment ( which he so often was , which was one of the most attractive things about him . Years later , I 'd realize this ) . " Let us make a clean break , " he sort of mumbled . " Right now . It can not go on , and we both know it . " <p> We had reached the parking lot in front of the chapel by then ; the sunlight reflected off all the cars was dazzling . <p> Dr. Pierce stuck out his hand in an oddly formal gesture . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " and good-bye . " <p> Dr. Pierce had chosen his moment well . He knew I would n't make a scene in front of all these people . But I refused to take his hand , rushing off madly through the parked cars to my own , gunning it out of there and out to the lake where I parked on the bluff above Donnie 's cabin , in the exact spot where he and I had been together so many times . I sat at the wheel and looked out at the lake , now full of children on some kind of school outing . Their shrill screams and laughter drifted up to me thinly , like the sounds of birds in the trees around my car . I remember I leaned back on the seat and stared straight up at the sun through the trees  --  just at the top of the tent of green , where light filtered in bursts like stars . <p> But I could n't give him up , not yet , not ever . <p> I resolved to surprise Dr. Pierce in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , telling my parents I 'd gone on a trip to Virginia Beach with friends . I got his summer address from the registrar 's office . I drove up through Richmond and Washington , a seven-hour drive . It was a crazy and even a dangerous thing to do , since I had never been to New York . But finally I ended up in front of the brownstone in the Village where Dr. Pierce and his wife were subletting an apartment . It was midafternoon and hot ; I had not imagined New York to be so hot , hotter even than McKenney , Va . I was still in a fever , I think . I knocked on the door , without even thinking what I would do if his wife answered . But nobody answered . Nobody was home . Somehow this possibility had not occurred to me . I felt suddenly , totally exhausted . I leaned against the wall , and then slid down it , until I was actually sitting on the floor in the hall . I pulled off my pantyhose and stuffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was too hot . I wore a kelly-green linen dress ; somehow I 'd thought I needed to be all dressed up to go to New York . I do n't even remember falling asleep , but I was awakened by Dr. Pierce shaking my shoulder and saying my name . <p> Whatever can be said of Dr. Pierce , he was not a jerk . He told me firmly that our relationship was over , and just as firmly that I should not be driving around New York City at night by myself , not in the shape I was in . <p> By the time his wife came home with groceries , I was lying on the studio bed , feeling a little better . He told her I was having a breakdown , which seemed suddenly true . Dr. Pierce and I looked at the news on TV while she made spaghetti . After dinner she lit a joint and handed it to me . It was the first time anybody had ever offered me marijuana . I shook my head . I thought I was crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . She was pale with long , long blonde hair , which she had worn in a braid at school , or up on top of her head . Now it fell over her shoulders like water . I realized that she was not much  --  certainly not ten years  --  older than I was , and I wondered if she , too , had been his student . But I was exhausted . I fell asleep on the studio couch in front of a fan , which drowned out the sound of their voices as they cleaned up from dinner . <p> I woke up very early the next morning . I wrote the Pierces a thank you note on an index card which I found in Dr. Pierce 's briefcase and left it propped conspicuously against the toaster . The door to their bedroom stood open , but I did not look in . <p> Out on the street I was horrified to find that I had gotten a parking ticket and that my convertible top had been slashed-gratuitously , too , since there was nothing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else about my trip to New York , more than Dr. Pierce 's rejection  --  or his renunciation , as I preferred to consider it  --  which is how I did consider it , often , during that summer at home while I had the rest of my nervous breakdown . <p> My parents were very kind . They thought it all had to do with Don Fetterman , who was missing in action in Vietnam , and maybe it did , sort of . I was " nervous " and cried a lot . Finally my Aunt Dee got tired of me mooning around , as she called it . She frosted my hair and took me to Myrtle Beach , where it proved impossible to continue the nervous breakdown . The last night of this trip Aunt Dee and I double-dated with some realtors she 'd met by the pool . <p> Aunt Dee and I got back to McKenney just in time for me to pack and drive to school , where I was one of the seniors in charge of freshman orientation . Daddy had gotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blond ; and I 'd lost 25 pounds . <p> The campus seemed somehow smaller to me as I drove through the imposing gates . My footsteps echoed as I carried my bags up to the third floor of Old North , where Dixie and I would have the coveted " turret room . " I was the first one back in the whole dorm , but as I continued to haul things in from my car , other seniors began arriving . We hugged and squealed , following a script as old as the college . At least three girls stopped in mid-hug to push me back , scrutinize me carefully , and exclaim that they would n't have recognized me . I did n't know what they meant . Sweaty and exhausted after carrying everything up to our room , I decided to shower before dinner . I was standing naked in our room , toweling my hair dry , when the dinner bell began to ring . Its somber tone sounded somehow elegiac to me in that moment . On impulse , I began rummaging around in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was looking for . I went to stand at the window while the last of the lingering chimes died on the August air . <p> I held the mirror out at arm 's length and looked at myself . I had cheekbones . I had hipbones . I could see my ribs . My eyes were darker , larger in my face . My wild damp hair was as blonde as Lily 's . I looked completely different . Clearly , something had finally happened to me . <p> That weekend Dixie , Donnie , Lily , and I went out to Donnie 's cabin to drink beer and catch up on the summer . We telephoned Melissa , now eight months pregnant , who claimed to be blissfully happy and said she was making curtains . <p> Lily snorted . She got up and put Simon and Garfunkel on the stereo , and got us all another beer . Donnie lit candles and switched off the overhead light . Dixie waved her hand , making the big diamond sparkle in the candlelight . Trey , now in law school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dixie was already planning her wedding . We would all be bridesmaids , of course . ( That marriage , oddly , would last for only a few years , and Dixie would divorce once more before she went to law school herself . ) Donnie told us all about her mother 's new boyfriend . We gossiped on as the hour grew late and bugs slammed suicidally into the porch light . The moon came up big and bright . I kept playing " The Sound of Silence " over and over ; it matched my mood , my new conception of myself ( " In my dreams I walk alone , over streets of cobblestone .... " I also liked " I Am a Rock ; I Am an Island " ) . <p> Finally Lily announced that she was in love , really in love this time , with a young poet she 'd met that summer on Cape Cod , where she 'd been waitressing . We waited while she lit a cigarette . " We lived together for two months , " Lily said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could look out and see the water . " We all just stared at her . None of us had ever lived with anybody , or known anyone who had . Lily looked around at us . " It was wonderful , " she said . " It was heaven . But it was not what you might think , " she added enigmatically , " living with a man . <p> " For some reason I started crying . <p> There was a long silence , and the needle on the record started scratching . Donnie got up and cut it off . They were all looking at me . <p> " And what about you , Charlene ? " Lily said softly . " What happened to you this summer , anyway ? " <p> It was a moment which I had rehearsed again and again in my mind . I would tell them all about my affair with Dr. Pierce , and how I had gone to New York to find him , and how he had renounced me because his wife was pregnant . I had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . " It was awful , " I said finally , and Dixie came over and hugged me . " What was awful ? " she said , but I could n't even speak ; my mind filled suddenly , oddly , with Don Fetterman as he 'd looked in high school , presiding over the Tri-Hi-Y Club . He held the gavel firmly in his hands ; he could call any group to order . <p> " Come on , " Dixie said , " tell us . " <p> The candles were guttering ; the moon made a path across the lake . I took a deep breath . <p> " Bubba is dead , " I said . <p> " Oh , God ! Oh no ! " A kind of pandemonium ensued , which I do n't remember much about , although I remember the details of my brother 's death vividly . Bubba drowned in a lake in Canada , attempting to save a friend 's child that had fallen overboard . The child died , too . Bubba was buried there , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only funeral was what his friends said as they spoke around the grave one by one . His best friend had written to me , describing the whole thing . <p> " Charlene , Charlene , why did n't you tell us sooner ? " Donnie asked . <p> I just shook my head . " I could n't , " I said . <p> Later that fall I finally wrote a good story  --  about my family , back in McKenney  --  and then another , and then another . I won a scholarship to graduate school at Columbia University in New York , where I still live with my husband on the West Side , freelancing for several magazines and writing fiction . <p> It was here , only a few weeks ago , that I last saw Lily , now a prominent feminist scholar . She was in town for the MLA convention . We went to a little bistro near my apartment for lunch , lingering over wine far into the late December afternoon while my husband babysat . Lily was in the middle of a divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , twirling her tulip wineglass , " I have often thought that the one great tragedy of my life was never getting to meet your brother . Somehow I always felt that he and I were just meant for each other . " We sat in the restaurant or a long time , at the window where we could see the passersby hurrying along the sidewalk in the dismal sleet outside , each one so preoccupied , so caught up in his own story . We sat there all afternoon . <p> <p> By LEE SMITH <p>
