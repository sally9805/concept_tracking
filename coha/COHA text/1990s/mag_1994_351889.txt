If she followed the welfare-reform debate , Anita Hill must be having post- traumatic flashbacks . Here we have a collection of important white males , including Bill Clinton , Pat Moynihan and Bill Bennett , scowling down on one small , scared , female figure  --  embodied , in this case , in the Welfare Recipient . The women in the 5 million families on welfare are no more , and no less , representative of American womanhood than Anita Hill was . But the assault on welfare , like the Senate committee 's interrogation of Professor Hill , is an implicit attack on the dignity and personhood of every woman , black or white , poor or posh . <P> Take first the universal , nearly unquestioned assumption that welfare mothers " do n't work , " and that the goal of reform is to get them out of their own kitchens and into those of , say , Burger King . Well , ladies , what have we been doing in our kitchens all these years if not some species of work ? No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed , wash , dress and pick up after , and the assumption of the welfare reformers seems to be that these activities are on a par with bonbon consumption . In the conceptual framework that holds that welfare mothers " do n't work , " affluent married homemakers ca n't rank much higher than courtesans . <P> Churlish males have suspected for decades that homemaking is little more than a sinecure for the low-skilled and occupationally impaired . Of course no husband dares look his wife in the eye  --  often bloodshot from sleep deprivation  --  and tell her that she " does n't work . " Yet somehow the insult is assumed to be forgivable when directed at the down-and-out . <P> The most pernicious feature of the recent welfare debate , though , from a feminine point of view , has to be the thriving new rhetoric of " illegitimacy . " Until a few months ago , the term illegitimate , when applied to a human child , had more or less fallen from use and been replaced by the less pejorative out-of-wedlock . The courts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmarried parents . Feminists have insisted that every child is equally real and deserving , regardless of the circumstances of his or her conception . <P> Then Dan Quayle , followed by professional welfare basher Charles Murray , decided that the old stigma against the out-of-wedlock was in urgent need of revival . They argue that " illegitimate " babies are clogging the welfare rolls , and that welfare , perversely , is an incentive for the production of more of them . According to one online database , the number of newspaper articles linking welfare and " illegitimacy " hovered at about 100 a year or fewer between ' 90 and ' 93 and then jumped to 157 for the first six months of ' 94 alone . <P> In fact , " illegitimacy " has about as much to do with welfare as baldness does with Social Security expenditures . Numerous studies have established that welfare does not serve as an incentive to bear additional babies . Furthermore , out-of-wedlock births are increasing throughout the industrial world  --  not because of generous welfare policies but because of changing mores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Recall that Dan Quayle 's original target was n't some impecunious pregnant teenager but the high-achieving Murphy Brown .
