After spending a weekend with his father in Los Angeles , a 10-year-old boy with divorced parents is returned to his mother 's house in El Monte , a valley town a short bus ride to the east . Men in uniform tell him his mother was murdered early that morning . The son shows no emotion to the officers but breaks down on the bus ride back with his father : " I cried . I cranked tears out all the way to L.A. I hated her . I hated El Monte . Some unknown killer just bought me a brand-new beautiful life . " <P> James Ellroy has told this story from his own childhood before , mainly to journalists attracted to his growing renown as a writer of dark , scarifyingly violent crime novels ( The Black Dahlia , L.A. Confidential ) . The anecdote enhanced his reputation , setting him off from his competitors . How many other toilers in the thriller trade could claim a mother murdered in a crime still unsolved ? But My Dark Places ( Knopf ; 355 pages ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than instant publicity in mind . Part memoir , part detective story , part meditation on the kind of men who kill and the women who die at their hands , Ellroy 's new book displays a reality more chilling than fiction . <P> The narrative switches back and forth in time , from the Sunday morning , June 22 , 1958 , when Jean Ellroy 's strangled body was discovered near a high school athletic field in El Monte , up to the recent past , when James , her only child , teams up with a retired member of the Los Angeles sheriff 's department to investigate the old unsolved murder all over again . In between , Ellroy portrays the harrowing spell , unrecognized by him at the time , that his mother 's fate cast over his adolescence and the sort of person and writer he would become . <P> Glad , he thinks , to be rid of his strict mother and living a largely undisciplined life with his feckless father , Ellroy grows addicted to crime stories : " Every book I read was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for her in ellipses . " When his father dies , the still underage son goes into a long tailspin : alcohol , drugs , sleeping in public parks , petty burglaries , time in county jails . Miraculously , he rights himself and becomes a published writer . " I was hot to ascend , " he says . " Ascension meant two things . I had to write a great crime novel . I had to attack the central story of my life . " <P> He eventually wrote American Tabloid ( 1995 ) , a crime novel that transcends the form in its imaginative breadth and depth . My Dark Places , which grew out of an article he wrote for GQ , is Ellroy 's attempt to fulfill the second part of this bargain with himself , and it largely succeeds . Readers new to Ellroy may find his clipped , staccato prose disconcerting , particularly when it describes details of his mother 's corpse and the procedures at her autopsy . He is also quite blunt about the sexual allure that memories of his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him : " I had to relive my incestuous fantasies and contextualize them and embellish them past the shame and the sense of boundary that always restricted them . I had to shack up with my mother . "
