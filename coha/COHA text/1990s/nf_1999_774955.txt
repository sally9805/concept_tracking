Policing Race and Class // Miami to Atlanta is 663 miles . If you had a choice , you 'd fly . Those who ca n't afford air travel often make the trip by bus , a grueling nineteen-hour ride . On August 27 , 1985 , Terrance Bostick , a twenty-eight-year-old black man , was sleeping in the back seat of a Greyhound bus , on his way from Miami to Atlanta , when he awoke to find two police officers standing over him . They were wearing bright green " raid " jackets bearing the Broward County Sheriffs Office insignia and displaying their badges ; one held a gun in a plastic gun pouch . The bus was stopped at a brief layover in Fort Lauderdale , and the officers were " working the bus , " looking for persons who might be carrying drugs . // Upon waking Bostick , the officers asked for his identification and ticket . He complied . They then asked to search his bag . Again , Bostick complied , somewhat inexplicably , because upon opening the bag , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at no time prior to the search did they have any basis for suspecting Bostick of any criminal activity . // Bus and train sweeps of this kind are a common method of drug enforcement investigations . Police board buses or trains at intermediate stops to exploit the fact that the traveler has nowhere to go . In theory , passengers have a constitutional right to refuse to answer any questions , and to say no when a police officer asks to search their luggage . In practice , virtually everybody talks and consents . One officer testified that he had searched 3,000 bags without once being refused consent . The tactic works . In West Palm Beach alone , bus sweeps over a thirteen-month period netted 300 pounds of cocaine , 800 pounds of marijuana , 24 handguns , and 75 suspected drug " mules . " But whether it should be constitutional raises fundamental questions about the role of race in law enforcement decisionmaking , and about the courts ' responsibility to police the police . // REASONABLE PEOPLE // When prosecutors charged Bostick with drug possession , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida Supreme Court held it unconstitutional . The court reasoned that Bostick had effectively been " seized " when the officers cornered him at the back of the bus , because at that moment he was not free to leave . The Fourth Amendment forbids the police from seizing individuals without some individualized suspicion that they have committed or are committing a crime , and the police admitted they had none for Bostick . The remedy for such a violation  --  under the Fourth Amendment 's " exclusionary rule "  --  is that the prosecution may not use evidence obtained by the encounter to establish its case . In addition to holding the evidence inadmissible against Bostick , the Florida Supreme Court broadly condemned " bus sweeps , " likening them to methods used by totalitarian states : // The evidence in this case has evoked images of other days , under other flags , when no man traveled his nation 's roads or railways without fear of unwarranted interruption , by individuals who had temporary power in the Government . . . This is not Hitler 's Berlin , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . Yet in Broward County , Florida , these police officers approach every person on board buses and trains ( " that time permits " ) and check identification , tickets , ask to search luggage  --  all in the name of " voluntary cooperation " with law enforcement ? // Florida 's Attorney General appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court , which agreed to hear the case . In the Supreme Court , Bostick was represented by Donald Ayer , a highly respected Washington lawyer with impeccable conservative credentials . A Republican , Ayer had clerked for Chief Justice William Rehnquist . Shortly before taking Bostick 's case , he had stepped down from a position as the Deputy Solicitor General , where he had represented the Reagan administration in some of its most politically charged cases before the Supreme Court . Ayer felt that this was a case of law enforcement going too far , and offered to handle Bostick 's case pro bono before the Supreme Court . Ayer convinced Americans for Effective Law Enforcement , a pro-law-enforcement organization that had previously filed eighty-five amicus briefs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file an amicus brief on Bostick 's behalf urging the Court to find an unreasonable seizure in this case . // The principles at stake were fairly basic . The Fourth Amendment prohibits " unreasonable searches and seizures , " and the Supreme Court had previously held that a " seizure " is unreasonable without some articulable reason , specific to the individual , for suspecting crime . Seizures come in two varieties : full-scale arrests , which require probable cause that the individual has committed a crime ; and brief " stops , " which require only a reasonable suspicion that crime is afoot . But all seizures require at least some degree of individualized suspicion , and the police had admitted that they had none when they approached Bostick. // Not every encounter between a citizen and a police officer , however , is a " seizure " that must be justified under the Fourth Amendment . Otherwise , police officers would not be able to approach anyone on the street without first having grounds to suspect criminal conduct . In prior cases , the Court had ruled that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by means of physical force or show of authority , the officer has restrained the citizen 's liberty , " and that the relevant question is whether a reasonable person in the citizen 's shoes would feel " free to disregard the officer 's questions and walk away . " // Few of us , awakened in the middle of a marathon bus ride by armed police officers standing over us , asking for our identification and requesting to search our bags , would feel free to tell the officers to mind their own business . But the Supreme Court 's " reasonable person " apparently has a lot more mettle than the average Joe . The Court had previously ruled , for example , that a traveler approached by police in an airport and asked to show his identification and ticket was not " seized " by the encounter , because a " reasonable person " would feel free to walk away . As long as the police do not convey a message that their requests must be obeyed , the Court ruled , they can approach citizens without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their identification , and request to search their luggage . // But even accepting the dubious proposition that a passenger walking through an airport will feel free to ignore an approaching police officer , Ayer argued , it is quite another thing to say that a reasonable person in Bostick 's place would have felt free to ignore the two officers who stood above him in the bus aisle , blocking the only way out . Even if Bostick had been able to push his way around the officers and get off the bus , he would have found himself in the middle of rural Florida , far from his destination , and separated from any luggage he 'd checked . If he chose to remain on the bus but to refuse to cooperate , he might reasonably have predicted that his conduct would raise police suspicion , and lead to their searching his bags anyway , or worse . The encounter was not truly consensual , as Bostick 's conduct demonstrated . Indeed , Ayer argued , no " reasonable person " would agree to a search of a bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was free to say no without adverse consequences . // The Supreme Court rejected Ayer 's arguments , and reversed the Florida Supreme Court . The proper test , the Court explained , was not whether a reasonable person in Bostick 's shoes would have felt free to leave  --  the test the Court had used until Bostick 's case  --  but to terminate the encounter . The Court posited that even if he did n't feel free to leave , a " reasonable person " would have felt free to sit there and adamantly refuse to answer the police officer 's questions . That Bostick was on a bus may well have restricted his freedom to walk away , but , the Court reasoned , that was n't the police 's fault . The police did not make him get on the bus . They merely found him there . Bostick would have to point to something extraordinary in the police officer 's conduct to establish that he had been " seized . " The mere fact that they had boarded the bus en route , were standing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun , and directing questions at him was not enough . // The consequence of Florida v. Bostick is that police are free to engage in dragnet-like searches of buses and trains , in settings where it is extremely difficult for any citizen to refuse to cooperate . As long as the police do not effect a " seizure , " there are no Fourth Amendment limits whatsoever on whom they approach or what questions they ask . They could routinely direct such inquiries at every person on every bus , train , and for that matter , airplane in America . // By adopting a " reasonable person " standard that is patently fictional , this ruling allows the police to engage in substantial coercion under the rubric of " consent , " without any limits on the persons to whom that coercion can be applied . As federal judge Prentice Marshall explained in a separate case , " implicit in the introduction of the officer and the initial questioning is a show of authority to which the average person encountered will feel obliged to stop and respond . Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " The Court 's test assumes the opposite , and finds coercion only where police engage in some coercive conduct above and beyond their inherent authority . For all practical purposes , the Court 's test erases the inherently coercive nature of all police encounters from the legal calculus for determining whether a Fourth Amendment " seizure " has occurred ? As long as police officers use only the inherent coercion of their own official identity , they are free to seek citizens ' " cooperation " for questioning and searches . In Bostick the Court went still further , permitting the police to exploit circumstances that independently constrain citizens ' freedom to escape an encounter with the police . // The Court 's reasonable person fiction has its benefits . It substantially reduces the law enforcement costs that would result were the Fourth Amendment applied to all nonconsensual encounters . By adopting a standard that ignores the coercion inherent even in a situation such as Bostick 's , the Court permits the police to engage in a wide range of nonconsensual , coercive intrusions on privacy without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fiction deprives all of us of our Fourth Amendment rights ; it equally ignores the coerciveness of police encounters with rich white businessmen and unemployed black teenagers . But this standard will have very different effects on the poor and the wealthy , and on minority and white citizens . First , the police are far more likely to use this unfettered discretion against black teenagers than white executives . In practice , the police are selective about their targets . This is partly a matter of resources ; the personnel required to confront all travelers would be extraordinary , and the yield would likely be small , because the vast majority of travelers presumably are not carrying contraband . Selective enforcement may also , however , reflect a savvy political judgment ; if the police did in fact inflict such suspicionless treatment on everyone , there would likely be sufficient political will to curtail the practice politically , either by legislation or by community pressure on police departments . // So the police " work the buses " selectively , and because in the Court 's view no " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they select their targets . Targets could be selected at random , on the basis of unadulterated hunches , or , more likely , on the basis of unspoken stereotypes and assumptions about the kind of traveler likely to be carrying contraband . There is good reason to believe that minorities in general , and young black men in particular ( such as Terrance Bostick ) , are disproportionately targeted . This tactic is practiced not on airplanes , but on buses and trains , modes of transportation more frequently used by poor and minority travelers . Once on the train , few officers will choose to approach an elderly white woman or a well-dressed businessman over a young black man " roughly dressed . " There are few available statistics on the racial breakdown of police stops . Where reported cases discuss bus and train sweeps , however , the defendants are virtually always black or Hispanic . A search of all reported federal bus and train sweep cases from January 1 , 1993 , to August 22 , 1995 , found that , of fifty-five cases in which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eleven were Hispanic , one was Asian , one was Filipino , and six were white . As Justice Thurgood Marshall stated in dissent in Bostick , " the basis of the decision to single out particular passengers during a suspicionless sweep is less likely to be inarticulable than unspeakable . " // Thus , although the doctrine leaves the police free to target whomever they please , the targets will not be random ; by and large they will be young black men . All relevant data  --  from arrest rates to conviction rates to victim reporting  --  suggest that young people are more likely to commit crime than old people , men more likely than women , and black people more likely than white people . The disproportionate numbers of young black men in prison and jail  --  disparities that can not be explained by discriminatory policing or prosecuting alone  --  suggest that if police are going to be guided not by individualized suspicion but by more general characteristics , the odds of discovering some evidence of crime will be greater if they stop young black men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercive behavior without any articulable basis for individualized suspicion , the Court 's standard encourages the police to act on race-based judgments . // Second , the Court 's " objective , " one-size-fits-all reasonable person standard fails to take into account that citizens may be differently situated with respect to encounters with the police . It would seem noncontroversial , for example , that a fourteen-year-old child would feel less free to terminate an encounter with a police officer than a fifty-year-old member of Congress , even if the encounters were identical in all other respects . Yet the Supreme Court has held that the reasonable person standard " does not vary with the state of mind of the particular individual being approached , " and " calls for consistent application from one police encounter to the next , regardless of the particular individual 's response to the actions of the police . " Applying that ruling , the District of Columbia Court of Appeals held that the same reasonable person standard applies to a fourteen-year-old child as to an adult . // A citizen 's prior experiences with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coercive an encounter seems . As the acquittal of O.J. Simpson dramatically illustrated , there is little love lost between the black community and the police in many areas of the nation . A survey of the Los Angeles Police Department found that one-quarter of the 650 officers responding agreed that " racial bias ( prejudice ) on the part of officers toward minority citizens currently exists and contributes to a negative interaction between police and the community , " and that " an officer 's prejudice toward the suspect 's race may lead to the use of excessive force . " For a host of reasons , from the disproportionate number of blacks behind bars today , to the historical use of the criminal justice system to maintain racial subordination , to the contemporary treatment of blacks on the streets by many police , the black community has a low level of trust for the criminal justice system , and for the police in particular . // The videotaped beating of Rodney King by officers of the Los Angeles Police Department encapsulated for many blacks the treatment they expect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quoted as saying at a subsequent hearing on LAPD practices , " When black people in Los Angeles see a police car approaching , ' They do n't know whether justice will be meted out or whether judge , jury and executioner is pulling up behind them . ' " Similarly , a black man encountering a police officer in the Bronx today can not help being affected by the knowledge that police officers there have engaged in a practice of indiscriminate beatings of minority citizens in order to establish their authority . In 1994 , the Mollen Commission reported on widespread police corruption and brutality in the Bronx . One officer testified that he was called " the Mechanic , " because " I used to tune people up , " a " police word for beatin ' up people . " He testified that the beating was widespread : // Q. Did you beat people up who you arrested ? // A. No . We just beat people up in general . If they 're on the street , // hanging around drug locations . Just  --  It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these beatings done ? // A. To show who was in charge . We were in charge , the police . // The officer admitted that most of the victims were black and Hispanic , although he denied that the attacks were racially motivated . He conceded that the neighborhood residents hated the police , saying , " You 'd hate the police too , if you lived there . " // The Mollen Commission found that police corruption , brutality , and violence were present in every high-crime precinct with an active narcotics trade that it studied , all of which have predominantly minority populations . It found disturbing patterns of police corruption and brutality , including stealing from drug dealers , engaging in unlawful searches , seizures , and car stops , dealing and using drugs , lying in order to justify unlawful searches and arrests and to forestall complaints of abuse , and indiscriminate beating of innocent and guilty alike . The commission found that police officers and supervisors often accepted lying and brutality as necessary aspects of the job , in part because of what they perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the police officers ' " Us vs . Them " mentality , particularly in minority communities . // Similar practices were ongoing in Philadelphia , as Arthur Colbert , a black college student from Michigan , learned first-hand in 1991 when he made the mistake of getting lost in North Philadelphia while looking for his date . Two police officers looking for a drug dealer named Hakim pulled Colbert over , put him in a police van , and took him to an abandoned house , where they repeatedly accused him of being Hakim . Colbert showed them his Temple University ID and his driver 's license , but they were not deterred . The officers hit him with their flashlights and a two-by-four . When Colbert still would not admit to being Hakim , one officer put his gun to Colbert 's head and said , " If you do n't tell us what we want to know , I 'm going to blow your head away . You have three seconds . " He cocked the gun 's hammer and began to count down : " Three . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was n't anything Colbert could tell them , because he was n't Hakim , and had never even heard of Hakim . The officers ultimately let him go without charges . // This was only one of many such stories uncovered in a corruption investigation in Philadelphia , which found a pattern of misconduct directed at the predominantly poor black neighborhood of North Philadelphia . In the early 1990s , a group of police officers there engaged in a widespread practice of beating and robbing citizens , planting evidence , and lying to support false convictions . The investigation 's disclosures led to several criminal convictions of the police officers , and reversals of over fifty criminal convictions obtained on the strength of the officers ' testimony . // Stories of black men being stopped by the police for no apparent reason other than the color of their skin are so common that they are not even considered news , and often get reported only when the victims happen to be celebrities or the confrontation is captured on film . In 1988 , Joe Morgan , former All-Star second baseman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport waiting for a flight to Tucson . According to Morgan and an eyewitness , a police officer approached Morgan while he was making a phone call , said he was conducting a drug investigation , asked for his identification , and accused him of traveling with another person suspected of dealing drugs . Morgan objected , and turned to get his identification from his luggage , forty feet away . The officer grabbed him from behind , forced him to the floor , handcuffed him , put his hand over Morgan 's mouth and nose , and led him off to a small room , where the police ascertained that Morgan was not traveling with the suspected drug dealer after all . The police maintained that Morgan had been hostile throughout the encounter , and that he had been forced to the floor only after he started swinging his arms . Even by the police officer 's own account , however , the only basis for approaching Morgan in the first place was that another black man , stopped as a suspected drug dealer , had told the officers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " As a result , the officers were on the lookout for a black man , and Joe Morgan fit that description . // In 1989 , former police officer Don Jackson was doing a news story about police abuse against black men in Long Beach , California , when he was pulled over by the police on Martin Luther King , Jr. , Boulevard , allegedly for straddling lanes . When he asked why he was being stopped , an officer pushed him through a plate glass store window . NBC captured the incident on film . In 1992 , the ABC newsmagazine " 20/20 " conducted an experiment , sending out two groups of young men  --  one white , the other black  --  on successive evenings in Los Angeles . They drove in identical cars and took identical routes at identical times . The black group was stopped and questioned by police on several occasions in one evening , while the white group saw police cars pass them by sixteen times without showing any interest . // In 1990 the Massachusetts Attorney General 's Civil Rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practice of subjecting black citizens to unconstitutional stops and searches . The report recounted more than fifty such incidents in 1989 and 1990 . The incidents followed the Boston Police Department 's announcement of a policy of searching on sight " known gang members " in Roxbury , a predominantly black neighborhood in Boston . A deputy superintendent admitted that he had instructed his officers to " stop and frisk any known gang members in a gang location where there has been high-crime problems . . . , and if there are other kids with the gangs that are not known to us , that we will search them too for the protection of my officers . " The report also discussed widespread complaints that the Boston Police Department had responded to the killing of a white woman , Carol Stuart , by engaging in unconstitutional stops , searches , and interrogations of young black men . Carol Stuart was in fact killed by her husband , Charles Stuart , a white man , who then falsely claimed that a black man had killed his wife . // As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and countless similar tales within the black community , black citizens , and particularly young black men , are likely to feel considerably less comfortable than members of other demographic groups in their encounters with police officers . Those practices were the backdrop for the encounter between the Broward County officials and Terrance Bostick , just as they are the backdrop for any encounter between a police officer and a black citizen . As Judge Julia Cooper Mack of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals put it in another case , " no reasonable innocent black male ( with any knowledge of American history ) would feel free to ignore or walk away from a drug interdiction team . " Yet the Supreme Court did not even mention Bostick 's race . // The Court 's use of a uniform reasonable-person standard effectively sanctions greater coercion against those more vulnerable to police authority . By failing to consider the citizen 's prior experiences with the police in determining whether a " seizure " has occurred , the Court permits the police to employ , on average , more coercion against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices against black citizens means that the same police conduct will be more threatening when directed against a black man than when directed against a white man . The objective standard builds that inequality into the criminal justice system , and sanctions it under the rubric of applying the same standard to all . // The effect is to tolerate a double standard . Most citizens will not be approached by a police officer for questioning unless the officer has some objective grounds for suspecting that they are involved in criminal activity . Our freedom to walk the streets is protected , in other words , by the constitutional requirement of probable cause . But young black men will routinely be subjected to police stops , not rising to the legal formality of " seizures , " simply because they are young black men . At the same time , the police will be able to apply more coercion to black citizens than to whites in such " noncoercive " encounters , because the Court 's legal standard presumes that we all have the same set of experiences vis-a-vis the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel coerced by an " ordinary " police encounter . As a result , the Court has it both ways  --  it protects the rights of some , but avoids the cost of extending the same protections equally to all . // CONSENT SEARCHES // Terrance Bostick had a choice . The police officers asked him whether they could search his bag . They did so because they had no legal authority to demand that he submit to such a search . The Supreme Court has held that the police generally can not conduct a search without obtaining a warrant , which must be based on probable cause that evidence of a crime is likely to be found in the area to be searched . Because the police had no reason to suspect Bostick was carrying drugs or anything else unlawful , they could not have searched or seized his bag . So they asked his permission . // According to the police 's story , they even told Bostick he had the right to say no . Yet knowing that his bag contained a pound of cocaine , Bostick agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been at Bostick 's side , his advice would have been simple : " Just say no . " The Fourth Amendment guarantees the right to refuse to consent to such a request . And a citizen 's exercise of that right does not authorize the police to take more intrusive steps . Had Bostick known and believed this , he would certainly have said no . He had everything to lose and nothing to gain by saying " yes . " Yet , like thousands of others in similar circumstances , he said yes . // The Supreme Court has held that " consent searches " satisfy the Constitution so long as the government demonstrates that the consent was " voluntary . " But as with the test for identifying a seizure , the Court has created a standard for consent that effectively countenances the coercion of unknowing and involuntary consents . And as with bus and train sweeps , those who are coerced into giving their consent are most likely to be the young , the poor , the uneducated , and the nonwhite. // In theory it makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the party searched is constitutional . Like other constitutional rights , the Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures is " waivable " ; that is , a person is free to choose not to exercise the right . Where an individual has made such a choice , there is no benefit to barring the search , and there may be some benefit to permitting it  --  either the police will find what they are looking for , or they wo n't and can focus their investigation elsewhere , allowing the individual to continue on his way . // But the Supreme Court is usually skeptical of claims that citizens have waived their constitutional rights ( because it is so rarely in one 's interest to do so ) . Thus , in every other setting the Supreme Court has held that the government bears the burden of demonstrating that a waiver was " knowing , intelligent , and voluntary . " When a defendant pleads guilty to a criminal charge , for example , the judge must first inform him of the consequences of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowingly . Similarly , when a citizen takes action that by statute has the effect of surrendering his citizenship  --  such as enlisting in a foreign army  --  the government can not in fact revoke his citizenship absent a showing that he took the action voluntarily and with full knowledge of the consequences . This strict waiver standard also applies to Miranda rights in a custodial interrogation , and to the right to have an attorney present at an identification lineup . // Yet consent searches , the Supreme Court held , do not require such a showing . In this setting , the Court merely requires that consent be " voluntary , " not that it be knowing and intelligent . As a result , the police officers who approached Bostick did not have to tell him that he had a right to say no . In 1973 , the Supreme Court explicitly rejected such a requirement . In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte , police officers pulled over a car at 2:40 A.M. for driving with a burntout headlight and license-plate light . They ordered all six occupants out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bustamonte , if they could search the car . He consented , and in the ensuing search the officers found three stolen checks . Bustamonte argued that the evidence should be suppressed because the police never told him he had the right to decline their request to search . How could he have meaningfully waived his constitutional right , he asked , without knowing that he had the right in the first place ? // Bustamonte 's argument was not without strong precedent . Only seven years earlier , the Supreme Court had held , in Miranda v. Arizona , that police officers must give a warning and establish a knowing , intelligent , and voluntary waiver of rights before obtaining a confession from a person in custody . Although the " Miranda warning " was formally based on the Fifth Amendment 's privilege against compelled self-incrimination , it was driven by equality concerns : the Court thought that requiring that every suspect be read his rights and provided an attorney on request would put all interrogation suspects on relatively equal footing . In addition , such warnings would help to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bustamonte argued that requiring a warning in the consent search setting would similarly give every citizen a roughly equal opportunity to assert her rights , and offset some of the coercion inherent in a police-citizen encounter . Yet in a 6-3 decision , the Supreme Court declined to extend Miranda 's reasoning to consent searches . The Court held that the " waiver " line of cases was limited to rights closely associated with trial rights . It reasoned that unlike waiver of a trial right , consent to a search is generally obtained in a fluid situation not susceptible to the strict showings required in the highly structured setting of a trial . But that contention does not adequately distinguish the Court 's application of the waiver standard to other nontrial constitutional rights , such as Miranda rights , rights of citizenship , and the right to be represented during a police lineup . // The real reason the Court rejected a warning requirement is found elsewhere in its opinion . The Court stressed that consent searches are an important investigative tool , and that the Court must balance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement of assuring the absence of coercion . " The most important consideration in that balance was the Court 's view that " the community has a real interest in encouraging consent . " Requiring a knowing , intelligent , and voluntary waiver would " in practice , create serious doubt whether consent searches could continue to be conducted . " And requiring a warning would be " thoroughly impractical , " the Court reasoned , despite the fact that federal agents were already in the practice of giving such warnings . In other words , the Court declined to require a warning because warnings would undermine the community 's interest in " encouraging consent . " But of course warnings would only discourage consent if individuals were saying yes because they did not know they had the right to say no. // The consent-search doctrine thus intentionally exploits the ignorance of the citizenry to reduce the law enforcement costs of the Fourth Amendment . It creates a constitutional loophole , by which police can and do routinely search people 's bags without any articulable basis for suspecting that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , close that loophole . It would seriously hamper investigative efforts used in bus and train sweeps , airport drug-courier investigations , and car stops . // The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed its desire not to discourage consent by providing citizens with information about their rights . Ohio v. Robinette arose out of a routine traffic stop in Ohio , when a police officer pulled over Robert Robinette for speeding . After checking Robinette 's license and issuing a warning , but before telling Robinette that he could leave , the officer ordered him out of the car , turned on a video camera in the officer 's car , and returned to ask Robinette whether he was carrying any drugs and whether he would consent to a search of his car . Robinette testified that he " automatically " consented . The police officer found a small amount of marijuana and a pill that turned out to be methamphetamine . The Ohio Supreme Court ruled that the officer had extended the stop beyond its legitimate traffic law enforcement purpose and had exploited the coercive setting of the traffic stop to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops were increasingly being used for such " consent " searches , and reasoning that " a ' consensual encounter ' immediately following a detention is likely to be imbued with the authoritative aura of the detention , " the Ohio Supreme Court adopted a bright-line rule requiring police officers to tell drivers they are free to leave before asking for consent to search . The United States Supreme Court reversed , holding that it would be " unrealistic " to require such a warning . Thus , police are free to use not only the confines of a bus or train to " encourage " consent , but also the coercive setting of a traffic stop . // Such reliance on ignorance and thinly veiled coercion is deeply troubling . As a very different Supreme Court said in 1964 , " no system of criminal justice can , or should survive if it comes to depend for its continued effectiveness on the citizens ' abdication through unawareness of their constitutional rights . The current system creates two Fourth Amendments  --  one for people who are aware of their right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a police officer , and another for those who do not know their rights or are afraid to assert them . // This double standard would be problematic even if it did not closely parallel race and class lines . But like the " reasonable person " standard , the consent doctrine in application is likely to reflect race and class divisions . Because a consent search requires no objective individualized suspicion , it is more likely to be directed at poor young black men than wealthy white elderly women . In addition , those who are white and wealthy are more likely to know their rights and to feel secure in asserting them . // In Schneckloth v. Bustamonte , the Court dismissed the concern that its rule would " relegate the Fourth Amendment to the special province of ' the sophisticated , the knowledgeable , and the privileged . ' " It cautioned that the " voluntariness " inquiry " has always taken into account evidence of minimal schooling , low intelligence , and the lack of any effective warnings to a person of his rights . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard used to tell whether someone has been " seized "  --  does allow for consideration of the different situations of each individual approached . In practice , however , the courts find consent to be voluntary in all but the most extreme circumstances . Ray O'Brien , a Georgetown University Law Center student , reviewed all cases involving consent searches decided by the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit from January 1 , 1989 , to April 15 , 1995 . In every case in which the validity of consent was challenged , the court found the consent voluntary . // In most of the cases , the courts did not even discuss the subjective factors that the Supreme Court in Schneckloth said would be relevant in determining voluntariness . When they did mention them , the courts turned a blind eye to factors strongly suggesting a less than voluntary encounter . In one case , for example , the police obtained consent to search an eighteen-year-old woman at 3:40 A.M. outside a bus station . An expert witness testified that the woman had an IQ only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes before she dropped out of school in ninth grade , read at a second-grade level and wrote at a third-grade level , and was suffering from a borderline personality disorder . Yet the court found her consent voluntary , stressing the absence of threatening behavior by the police officers . // In another case , the court found voluntary consent where a twenty-four-year-old defendant with only a tenth-grade education had on four previous occasions refused consent to police requests to search , only to be searched anyway each time . And in still another , the court noted that the defendant was young , foreign born , poorly educated , not fluent in English , and ignorant of his rights , only to hold that the trial court had not erroneously found his consent voluntary . If these factors do not support a finding that consent is involuntary , it is difficult to imagine what set of circumstances would invalidate consent . // Instead of focusing on the subjective characteristics of the defendant , courts generally focus on the conduct of the police . On that question , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word against that of the defendant , who has by definition been found to be carrying contraband ( because cases in which no contraband is found will rarely reach the courts ) . The difficulty of determining the truth concerning such encounters has long been recognized in the interrogation setting . Indeed , it was largely for that reason that the Supreme Court shifted from a case-by-case analysis of whether confessions were " voluntary " to the across-the-board requirement of the Miranda rules . Yet in the consent- search context , the courts have continued to engage in precisely the case-by-case inquiry that they recognized as deeply problematic in the interrogation setting . // Whether an individual 's consent to search can ever be truly voluntary is also rendered doubtful by the courts ' failure to protect the right to say no . The courts have never clearly answered a basic question : can the police use an individual 's exercise of her right to say no as a basis for developing suspicion justifying a nonconsensual search ? If the police can use a citizen 's negative answer against her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Supreme Court has said that the refusal to consent , " without more , " does not justify a search , but has not ruled on whether a refusal can be one factor among many contributing to the justification for a nonconsensual stop or search . Some courts have allowed the police to rely at least in part on a suspect 's refusal to consent to search to justify further police action . The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit has ruled that the manner in which a defendant withdraws consent to a search may be considered as a factor supporting reasonable suspicion . Other courts have held that a refusal can not be considered at all . The very fact that the law is unclear on this point means that a citizen confronted by the police can not know whether her choice to say no will be held against her . // The situation on the ground may even be worse : one of my students reports that when she attempted to teach the consent doctrine to prisoners at a federal prison in Virginia , her predominantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that although it might be true that she , a white woman , had the right not to consent , if they declined consent , the police would either beat them or go ahead and search anyway , and then testify that they had consented . It is of course difficult to verify such statements , but that perception itself will factor into a citizen 's decision to assert her rights . // The foreseeable impact of a rule that does not require the police in inherently coercive settings to inform people of their rights is that those who do not know their rights , and those who lack the assurance to assert their rights , will not in fact enjoy the protection of those rights . In Schneckloth itself , the Court admitted that informing citizens of their rights would be costly because it would discourage consent . But if that is the case , then the Court has consciously created a regime designed to coerce the less well educated and the less self-assured among us to surrender their constitutional rights . // ( Continues ... )    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
