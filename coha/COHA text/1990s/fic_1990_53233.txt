THE SUMMER EDDIE NET turned fifteen , his Uncle Abe was paroled from Florence State Penitentiary and moved in with Eddie 's family . He had served eleven years for armed robbery . " The war was hard on him , " Eddie 's father explained . While he and Abe had been overseas , their parents and little brother were killed in a fire . Abe 's fiancee died of cancer . " Everybody he loved died while he was in Italy-everyone but me , " said Eddie 's father . " We used to claim the war saved us . " <p> Unlike the rest of the family , Abe was tall , over six feet , though his shoulders and neck slumped forward . An athlete in his youth , he had quit school at fourteen to play professional baseball . When the war erupted , he was pitching for the Asheville Tourists , a veteran minor leaguer and part-time apprentice carpenter . He had grown thin eating prison food and developed a facial tic  --  a half-wink of his right eye . A metal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , causing it to angle sharply left then correct itself . " A bridge with a detour , " Abe liked to say . The year was 1969 . He was fifty-three and found work running a pool hall in downtown Tucson for less than minimum wage . <p> Eddie and his friends played eightball at the Silver Cue for free . In exchange for the games , Eddie helped Abe with the nightly cleanup . He swept cigarette butts and sprays of chalk from the wooden floor , and filled crates with empty pop bottles . The Silver Cue prohibited liquor , and players drank between games in their cars . By closing time , beer cans and wine bottles littered the parking lot . Eddie swept the debris into a pile with a push broom . He and Abe counted the cans as they tossed them into the trash bucket . <p> The final night of July , Eddie and Abe counted forty-seven cans-six short of the record . They lugged the garbage out back to the alley . A new dumpster shone white in the moon 's glare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mouth halfway up . They shoved the trash through the door . <p> Uncle Abe said , " This the stupidest garbage can I ever seen . A full growed man 's got to get in there and shovel it out over his head . " <p> Eddie explained that a truck with long handles scooped up the white dumpster , lifted it over the cab , and dumped it upside down into the truck bed . <p> Unable to imagine it , Abe laughed at first , thinking Eddie was joking . Then he grew quiet , and they stepped back inside . While they loaded the Coke machine-their final chore  --  Abe offered to teach Eddie how to shoot combinations . When Eddie hesitated , Abe said , " Your pa wo n't mind . " <p> They shot pool together through the night . Abe demonstrated the uses of spin , the angles of approaching a ball , the significance of touch . He emphasized the importance of the cue bali 's placement after a made shot . " That 's a good leave there , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But call the kiss next time . Some wo n't count it if you do n't call the kiss . If we was playing for money , I would n't . " <p> Eddie 's father joined them about three that morning . He appeared in his canvas jacket at the glass door , tapping lightly , as if there were nothing unusual in his son 's spending all night in a pool hall . <p> Eddie 's father and uncle played a long game of straight pool . They hardly spoke . The movement of their cues , the shapes their bodies took as they bent over the table , the touch of their shots  --  these served in the place of words . Until this night , Eddie had found it impossible to see his father and Abe as brothers . <p> At one point Eddie 's father said , " You 're off your game . " <p> Abe shrugged . His eye half-winked . " Happens . " <p> Eddie 's father seemed to know this night was not the product of whim or carelessness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this until he watched his father and uncle shoot pool . <p> Shortly before dawn , Abe led them out to the alley . They sat on a concrete stoop . Abe rolled cigarettes , which he and Eddie 's father smoked . Abe whistled " When Johnny Comes Marching Home . " He tried to whistle smoke rings , a talent he had acquired in prison . <p> Minutes before the earliest light , a truck roared down the alley , stopping before them with a hydraulic hiss . The dumpster shone dazzling white in the glare of high beams as the truck extended its metal arms and edged forward , guiding those arms into their slots . The truck cradled the dumpster . The arms rose above the cab and over , emptying the garbage into the back . <p> Abe said , " Slam dunk . " He pulled hard on his cigarette . " Need a degree anymore to take out the trash , " he added . A sardonic smile flickered across his face . His eye twitched . <p> Two nights later , Abe disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see for years . It said simply , Ca n't hack it . The final weekend of summer Abe held up a liquor store in Phoenix . He spent the last years of his life in prison . <p> A decade after the incident , the first night of his marriage to Jennifer Schacterly , Eddie related this story while they lay in their honeymoon bed . It was the first thing either had said after making love . He told her what he thought , that Abe discovered the world was too changed for him to stay in it . Jennifer liked the story , but she could n't see how Abe understood all that from an unfamiliar garbage dumpster . <p> Eddie sat up on the mattress , imitating the way Abe had sat in the alley , his knees doubled up almost to his chin . He described his uncle 's sideburns that reached his jaw , the wrinkled mustard-colored shirt , his stained fingers wrapping tobacco in crisp white paper . <p> " You loved your uncle , " Jennifer said , her voice sad and solicitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not what he was trying to express . " Close your eyes , " he said . He asked her to imagine ancient Spaniards who had just heard about the discovery of the New World . This , he believed , was the sensation his uncle experienced , except for Abe the Old World no longer existed-there was this new world and nothing else . <p> Jennifer smiled and touched his bare chest . While imagining Spaniards , she fell asleep . <p> Eddie tried to sleep , too , but death had entered his honeymoon bed , turning his stomach , chilling his extremities , making the odor of their nuptial sex heavy and oppressive . For more than a week , death made itself evident to him in the shallowness of every embrace , in the blandness of all food , in the moments after sex when Eddie knew the limitations of the body to speak for the heart . <p> After nine days , the darkness mysteriously lifted . Eddie again felt the joy of new love . <p> Years passed . Eddie recalled those nine dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie theater  --  once when he 'd seen an exhibit of the paintings of Van Gogh  --  and in each case , he quickly dismissed the memory . <p> Not that he did n't think about death . His father and uncle had died during this time , and he heard of the deaths of two men he had known as boys . His mother called one night to say that a woman he had dated in high school died of AIDS . He thought about death while watching a colorized version of " Top Hat " on television and learning the film was presented in memory of Fred Astaire  --  the announcement quickly followed by the dead man 's brilliant dancing . <p> Each of these times , and on countless other occasions  --  a bad bout with flu , the birth of his son , the heart attack of a friend  --  he thought about death , but during those nine days he had not been thinking about death at all . It had not been the fear of death that had setttled next to him , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later the thing returned . <p> The day had been ordinary . Eddie rose with the alarm , showered , woke his son . Jennifer scrambled eggs , toasted bread . Eddie packed his and his son 's lunches . While they ate , the boy told them his dream , which had to do with the trees in his schoolyard beginning to speak , reciting the alphabet and mathematical tables . The boy , Abraham Marcus for Eddie 's uncle and father , had become a steady source of happiness and renewal . <p> Nothing in the morning drive struck Eddie as unusual . No near accidents , no bits of shattered windshield littering the asphalt . Traffic moved responsibly . Pedestrians waited for lights to change . Eddie dropped Jennifer at the shopping mall where she managed the kitchenwares section of a department store . He took his son to elementary school . Eddie waited in the idling car until the boy disappeared with a wave into the building . Then he drove , uneventfully , to Whitman High School , where he taught American History and Civics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his third period class . <p> He stood before forty students taking roll , thinking about the discussion he would presently lead  --  the thirties , the Depression . Though he had taught this class a dozen times before , he could think of nothing to say . He put away his roll book , stood before them and smiled , but the smile was insincere . It occurred to him that this course also was insincere  --  a superficial survey of dates and events . If the course lacked sincerity , what of his whole career as a teacher ? For that matter , what in his life had meaning ? <p> He stood in front of the class several moments without speaking . The students grew quiet , sensing something wrong . He forced himself to concentrate on the material , but what was there to say , really ? The Depression was a bad time . Poverty , bankruptcies , the WPA , FDR  --  all of that was in the book . He felt wholly redundant and false . He could tell them there were breadlines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would see people waiting at the door of Safeway , gabbing with their neighbors , much the way they waited in line for concert tickets . <p> The desire to break the silence finally overcame his reluctance to speak . " Comments , " he said , meaning it as a question , but it carne out fiat and soft . <p> The room smelled of chalk , pencil shavings , and something darker - an earthy smell , the odor of an animal who lives by rooting in dirt . Then came another , stranger sensation-hot breath at his anus . Eddie broke out in a sweat . Death was here , he realized , this room , this moment . The breath grew warmer , followed by a gentle , urgent probing . <p> The young faces of his students remained calm , compliant , politely bored , like the impassive faces of snowmen . They waited , which was the nature of school , Eddie thought , waiting for something to happen . It was the very nature of life , he decided , of his life . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parts in their hair , the hip styles and odd cuts-all of which now seemed idiotic . <p> How would he get through this hour ? The Great Depression , he reasoned , had made him depressed . This thought cheered him for a moment , then death kissed his cheek , licked the rim of his ear . Death was not a metaphor . Its coarse tongue chafed his skin . <p> He began to hallucinate . In the rear of the classroom , silence took a physical shape  --  translucent bubbles , like soap bubbles but enormous , as large as the human heads they hovered above . They multiplied like amoebas and crowded forward . <p> Eddie wanted to believe he was having a breakdown . He preferred thinking this to what he knew : he was in the presence of death . <p> A single bubble broke free of the others and floated toward his desk , bouncing on invisible currents . Eddie saw his reflection , stretched and bloated in the sphere , the face of a drowning man . A second drifted forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> From the back of the room came a voice . " Mr. Net ? " <p> The bubbles vanished . In their place : a girl , one arm raised , propped up by the other , her new breasts misaligned by the raised arm 's pull . " Mr. Net ? " she said again . <p> " Yes , Cindy ? " Eddie said , death , for the moment , expelled . <p> Rain brought out an ugly smell in the car 's upholstery  --  cat urine . Eddie sat behind the wheel watching the yellow school buses pull away . At the corner of the gym , a boy and girl kissed . The boy  --  Hispanic and dark-skinned wearing a black muscle shirt  --  slipped one finger between the elastic waist of her skirt and the girl 's hip . She broke the embrace to run for her bus , looking back at him twice . The boy stepped into the rain and waved to her as the bus departed . <p> Eddie turned the ignition and his car came to life . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch for the windshield wipers did nothing . The fan for the vent did not work . Eddie cursed the car , an Impala and nine years old , always in need of repair . <p> He backed out of the parking space . The Hispanic boy yelled . The Impala had almost hit him . " You all right ? " Eddie opened his door to speak . <p> " No problem , " the boy said , his hair and shirt already soaked . <p> " Can I give you a ride somewhere ? " Eddie asked him . <p> The boy shook his head and sauntered off through the parking lot in the rain . <p> Eddie drove cautiously . Drops of rain splattered against the windshield . His chest tightened , and he felt he might suffocate . He pulled at his collar , but it was already loose . He directed the car into a gas station and shifted into park . <p> Lowering the window a few inches , he pushed his head into the crack of air and inhaled heavily . Rain hit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beast . <p> What brought this on ? He wondered but could find no answer . His life lacked the requisite drama for the appearance of death , and yet it had arrived . There had been his son 's sixth birthday party  --  the typical ice cream and chaos of children . Jennifer 's promotion to manager ? He had felt nothing but happiness for her . The anniversary of his father 's and his Uncle Abe 's deaths  --  they died on the same calendar day , three years apart  --  had recently passed , but Eddie had not thought of them , had not realized the day grew near until it was already past . <p> Finally he thought of a recent trip to the doctor , an afternoon of humiliation . He 'd had some shortness of breath , and an odd and painful testicular bump . His doctor  --  Townsend , the same man he 'd seen as a child  --  entered and left the room several times while a nurse stayed and attended to Eddie 's symptoms . <p> Chest x-rays came first . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He probed Eddie 's mouth with a tongue depresser . Eddie lowered his pants , and Townsend bent over him to examine the bump . " Here we go , " he said . " We can help you here . " The bump was merely an ingrown hair . Townsend directed his nurse to remove it , while he saw other patients . " I 'll be back with your chest x-rays , " he told Eddie . <p> The nurse donned plastic see-through gloves and lifted Eddie 's penis gingerly with thumb and forefinger . She squatted and stared at the bump . " You remember me ? " she said . <p> Eddie stared between his legs at her . " I 'm afraid I do n't , " he confessed . <p> " I was in your class five years ago . " She let go of him and stood up . " Randi Williams , ' member ? " <p> She reached for the metal stand at the foot of the bed . Eddie misunderstood and shook the gloved hand . <p> " You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the stand . " I sat in the front row next to that girl from India . " She lifted his penis again . " There 's pus , " she announced . She began her pecking at the sore . " You gave me an A minus . " <p> Eddie , so embarrassed that tears came to his eyes , could not look at her . " I do n't recall anyone , " he said , staring at the wall . " I do n't remember students . " <p> By the time Townsend returned with the x-rays , Eddie wanted only to leave . The black and gray negatives made him think of dark skies . " Your lungs . " Townsend tapped at light ovals shrouded in black . They looked to be the size of sandwich baggies . " No fluid , " Townsend said . " They 're not the lungs of an athlete , but hell ... " <p> " Sometimes I feel I ca n't catch my breath . Not often . Now and then , " Eddie said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Townsend explained . " You need to exercise more . Lose a few pounds . Other than that , you 're no worse off than anybody else . " <p> The episode , though degrading , could not account for what had happened today , Eddie decided . He mulled the thought over a long while , his breathing regular once more . He wiped at the fog on the windshield with his sleeve . He tried the wipers again , and they mysteriously worked . <p> Eddie left the window open for his drive home , arriving with drops of water clinging to his face , his shirt wet across one shoulder . <p> On his knees on the living room floor , Eddie 's son drew endless circles on large sheets of thick white paper . Eddie , in a dry shirt , a towel draped over one shoulder , asked what he was drawing . <p> " Circles , " Marc told him . <p> Eddie saw a face among the overlapping circles  --  an oblong face with drooping jowls , a clown 's nose , tiny eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hair appeared across the forehead , parted far to one side , and Eddie recognized the drawing . It was his face . The boy had drawn his father . <p> He kneeled and peered over Marc 's shoulder . The damp towel slid down his back to the floor . Yes , he thought , it 's me . A good likeness . <p> " Can I have it ? " he asked his son . " Can I have your picture ? " <p> Marc angled his head toward his father and smiled . He offered the pad of paper to him . Eddie carefully tore away the top sheet . He looked at the drawing as if into a mirror . The scarred and spattered face stared back as startled and disbelieving as an ancient Spaniard . <p> " Jennifer , " he called and hurried into the hall , where he met her just as she stepped from the bathroom . " Look what Marc drew . <p> " She nodded . " Circles . " <p> Eddie yanked the paper from her , and though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all he could now see . Circles . <p> On his knees beside his bed , Eddie tried to pray . The sun had not quite set and lit the room dimly . " Dear God , " he began , but that sounded too much like the opening of a letter . He started over . " God , what is happening to me ? " <p> He meant to wait for a reply , but a rattling began in his chest , which made him feel foolish , and he said what people always say when they pray . " Forgive me , " he whispered , then wondered what he 'd do if God did forgive him . What then ? <p> Jennifer stood in the doorway staring at him , her hands at her mouth . A tall and graceful woman , she had studied dance for seven years although she had no aptitude for it . All her life people had told her she looked like a dancer , and so she had tried . Her family had been disappointed in her choice of Eddie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor handsome . She 'd called him " Steady Eddie " when they first met . His temperament  --  and his love  --  were as solid as his stocky body . It startled her to see him on his knees . <p> " You were praying , " she said through her fingers . <p> Eddie stood to face her . " I think I 'm dying , " he told her , and as he said it , the idea earned his conviction , as if God really had answered his question . The revelation came with such power that his legs gave , and he was in danger of collapsing . He balanced himself with a hand on the mattress . Death was not only near ; it would not leave until it took him with it . <p> " I do n't believe in God anymore , " Jennifer said . She dropped her hands from her mouth to her hips . " I could n't ever find Him , and it 's been so long now since I tried . " She stepped around her husband and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you need to believe in , " Eddie said , settling beside her . " He 's either out there or He 's not . What we believe wo n't change that a bit . " <p> She touched his chest with one finger . " What makes you think you 're sick ? " <p> " I 'm not sick , I 'm dying . " Saying it again increased his conviction . <p> " There 's something inside me , moving around . " <p> This answer confused Jennifer . " Like a bug or a tapeworm ? " <p> " Like a monkey , " he said , " in a closet . " <p> Jennifer looked down to her lap . " That 's your heart , " she whispered . Louder , she said , " Are you sad about our marriage ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Teaching ? Is it teaching ? " <p> " You 're not listening . " <p> She touched his cheek . " What is it then ? " <p> " I 'm dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell back against the bed . The monkey in his chest hopped against his ribs , flipped over and bounced off his stomach , somersaulted up to the base of his throat , where it pushed off again , feet first . <p> Eddie sat in his pajamas and slippers on the couch beside Jennifer and pretended to read a magazine . He became aware of a dark line around himself , suspended an inch above the surface of his skin . When he moved , the outline moved with him , like a huge glove . Beyond this outline was death . <p> Eddie tried to see through the glove . He expected the outline to blur his vision or turn the world into a black-and-white movie . Instead , every object in the room shone brilliantly , like snow in sunlight . Even Jennifer 's cigarette ashes had rich texture . Seen through the filter of death , the ashtray held black hollows and sharp peaks , white craters , stretches of gray noise . <p> He pressed his palms to his eyes , which had begun to ache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an animal waited to inhabit him . A black bear . A deer . A starfish . A red grouse . <p> When Eddie removed his hands from his eyes , the glove had lifted . Death had gone . The ashtray merely held ashes . He relaxed against the couch cushion , but now the outline surrounded his wife , dangerously close . " Do n't move , " he told her . Speaking made the outline vanish . <p> " What is it ? " Jennifer asked . <p> Eddie did n't answer . He needed to look at their son . He leapt from the couch to find him , but his knee banged against the coffee table and the ashtray flew onto the floor , scattering Jennifer 's butts and speckled ashes . He swore , and it gave him some release , so he swore again , loudly , and kicked the table over . <p> Marc ran into the room and to his mother . " What is Daddy doing ? " he said . <p> Jennifer pulled him to her chest and covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , too softly for the boy to hear . <p> The psychologist wore a dark and dignified suit . His hair had the metallic shine of copper , and was elegantly cut . He smiled politely but with restraint when Eddie introduced himself . Almost everything in the room was made of oak-oak desk , oak filing cabinet , oak chairs with leather cushions . Books on oak shelves covered one entire wall . The room smelled of moldy books . <p> Dr. Sayre directed him to one of the oak chairs , which relieved Eddie as he had been afraid he would have to lie on a couch . <p> " What do you think is wrong with you ? " Dr. Sayre began . " I think <p> I 'm dying , " Eddie said plainly . <p> " What has led you to this conclusion ? " <p> Eddie said , " The presence of death . " <p> Dr. Sayre nodded and waited for him to continue , but Eddie did n't know what to add . " Let 's talk about that , " Sayre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like a friendly man . <p> Eddie began with the story of the nine black days following his wedding . It was a longer story than he recalled . At one point , he noticed Dr. Sayre glance to Eddie 's left . While continuing the story , Eddie casually looked that way . A pendulum clock in an oak case silently counted the seconds . Eddie coughed , covering his mouth , as if this were why he had turned his head . He pretended not to know the psychologist was bored . Dr. Sayre pretended not to have seen that Eddie noticed , jumping in with uncharacteristic verve when the story ended . <p> When Eddie looked again at Sayre , the doctor 's coppery hair had turned potato brown . His oak desk shone candy-apple red . <p> " It 's like the world changed color , " said Eddie . He thought perhaps this sort of thing might happen all the time , but you had to be dying to notice . Maybe there were advantages . <p> The psychologist 's hair returned to normal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know whether Jennifer was happy with their sex . " Does this question make you uncomfortable ? " he added . <p> " Yes , it makes me uncomfortable , " Eddie replied . " Describe what you 're feeling . " <p> " I do n't like talking about some things . I feel when I let them out , they 're less mine . " As he spoke the glove became visible . It brushed against the fine hairs on his arm and at the base of his neck , then lightly touched the raised bones of his ribs and the seam of his scrotum . " Besides , you do n't seem to care that I 'm dying . But then why should you ? " Looking at Sayre now , Eddie saw a glove hovering about him , too . " I 'm sorry , but you do n't know me , and even if I answer all your questions , you wo n't know me . " <p> " Can you explain this hostility you 're expressing now ? " Sayre wanted to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> He drove directly to school . An overweight , balding man addressed his fourth period students . He was the worst of the substitute teachers . He never followed a lesson plan and spoke vulgarly to make the kids laugh . Normally Eddie endured him . Dying , he did not have the time . <p> " I 'm back , " he said . " You can go . " <p> The substitute put his hands on his wide hips and glared at Eddie . The angle of his elbows turned his arms into flippers , and he became a walrus . The room began to smell of fish . Eddie laughed and said , " Get out . " <p> As he left , a new odor entered  --  a dark and swampy one . Eddie felt a seam of the glove touch his spine  --  cool , wet . The long and narrow tongue of a reptile . A lizard ? The tongue and scaley head now probed his anus for entry . A snake . A psychologist would make something of that , Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . <p> He turned to the students . Their foreheads glistened under the fluorescent lights like polished fruit . He saw the boys and girls with a clarity that would have been terrifying were he not already dying . He saw how spindly their arms were , how delicate their hands . He saw their freshly laundered , perfectly ironed blouses and purposefully tattered jeans as hopeless emblems of invincibility . He studied their faces , their somber , youthful , human faces . <p> " World War Two , " Eddie began , aware of the urgency in his voice , thinking how a mass of helmets seen from above would look like nothing more than turtle backs , how his father and Abe met by coincidence in southern Italy and held each other through the night like lovers , how they survived the war then got old and died anyway , how his death had come to him so that he could tell these stories . He began the telling . <p> <p> By ROBERT BOSWELL <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
