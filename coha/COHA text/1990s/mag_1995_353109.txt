NATION <P> Another Nominee Up in Smoke <P> Retired Air Force General Michael Carns withdrew his name from consideration to become the next CIA director . The here-we-go-again reason : possible illegalities concerning household arrangements . Carns said the FBI had informed him that his decision in the late 1980s to let a young Filipino move to the U.S. with Carns ' family may have violated labor and immigration laws . Worse , said the general , his family had had a falling out with the young man , who is making unspecified accusations that might embarrass Carns and the Administration if they come to light . President Clinton immediately turned to Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch  --  who has previously turned down the CIA directorship  --  to become the reluctant new nominee . <P> Altering Suits <P> The House of Representatives passed a package of sweeping legal reforms , which Republicans hailed as a national liberation from frivolous lawsuits and Democrats denounced as a victory for business over consumers . One measure would pressure parties in certain federal lawsuits to settle or else risk paying a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish national standards for product-liability cases and cap punitive damages in civil cases . After lobbying by pharmaceutical companies and doctors , the latter bill was amended to immunize the makers of FDA-approved drugs and devices from punitive damages and cap medical-malpractice awards for pain and suffering at $250,000 . <P> Tax Maneuvers <P> House Republicans formally unveiled their long-promised tax-cut plan . Among the proposals : a $500-per-child tax credit for families earning up to $200,000 a year , a capital-gains tax reduction and various corporate tax breaks . The plan was immediately criticized by Democrats as a giveaway to the rich . The package , whose five-year cost in lost revenues is estimated at $189 billion , also received cool reviews in the Senate  --  even among Republicans , where deficit reduction is a pre-eminent concern . <P> Hatfield Keeps His Hat <P> A move by young G.O.P. conservatives to dump Oregon 's Mark Hatfield from the chairmanship of the Senate Appropriations Committee fizzled in a closed-door party caucus . The conservatives were angry at Hatfield , who voted against the balanced-budget amendment  --  the lone Republican holdout . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their wish list ( after the balanced-budget amendment ) may also be in trouble , House G.O.P. leaders postponed voting on a congressional term-limits amendment until the end of the month in order to gather more support . <P> Clinton Backs Labor <P> President Clinton signed an Executive Order barring federal agencies from doing business with companies that hire permanent replacement workers during strikes . Republicans in Congress immediately began an effort to reverse the order by legislation . <P> Smoking : The New Mumps <P> Upping the ante in the tobacco debate , FDA Commissioner David Kessler said that nicotine addiction begins when most smokers are teenagers and that smoking should properly be addressed as a " pediatric disease . " The FDA , he said , is still studying whether to regulate or restrict the sale of tobacco-moves that would probably displease the current Congress . <P> New York : The New Texas
