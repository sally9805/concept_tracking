Christmas Eve , 1951 . L.A.P.D. Sergeant Jack Vincennes is canoodling his dance partner at a bash for a Dragnet-type show where he moonlights as technical adviser . He is explaining why his small-screen counterpart seems so bland compared with his own colorful persona . " That 's because he 's the television version , " smirks Jack , who pockets additional cash helping a sleazy Hollywood tabloid called Hush-Hush . " America is n't ready for the real me . " <P> Art imitates life . Vincennes , the flashy , morally enigmatic cop in the new film noir L.A. Confidential , is played by renowned character actor Kevin Spacey . But finding out who the real Spacey is can also be a daunting task , especially when you 're sitting next to him on a Beverly Hills hotel patio on a blistering summer afternoon . Spacey does n't look like a movie star ; with his soft , nondescript features , scruffy beard stubble and receding hairline , he could pass for the vacationing salesman at the next table . He does n't talk like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refusing to share the personal secrets that it has become so fashionable for celebrities to reveal . He may relent and discuss his dog Legacy , but definitely not his dates . " Every citizen who lives and respects the Constitution deserves a right to privacy , " he says . " It 's just a line I never felt comfortable crossing . " <P> And just in case you 're thinking you can tell something about the man by the movies he makes , Spacey cautions against looking for clues in the weird , quirky roles he has chosen . " People presume I 'm as complex as the characters I play , and I 'm not . My job is to interpret what someone else has created . " Indeed , during a two-hour conversation , the only moment when a glimpse of the real Spacey emerges is when he begins to bellow at questions about his penchant for playing bad guys . Still , as the actor 's current hot status in Hollywood attests , weird can be a good career move . <P> His breakthrough came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suspects , which won him an Oscar for his performance as the wily master criminal Keyser Soze , and Seven , in which he had an unbilled turn as the gruesome serial killer who cuts off Gwyneth Paltrow 's head . " Whether a character does good or bad things does n't interest me , " he insists . " It 's whether there are ambiguities . " Later this year he will appear as the Savannah , Ga. , antiques dealer accused of murder in Clint Eastwood 's adaptation of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil . <P> When Spacey was a guest host on Saturday Night Live , the writers had him croon a Sinatra tune while subtitles quipped , " Kevin Spacey plays psychos ... because he really is a psycho . " He loved the skit , hated the media 's typecasting . " Some of these films explored certain areas of how we treat each other that I find horrific , and that 's why I wanted to do them , " he says , practically seething . " But I have 16 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that 's the only way people view me. "
