LEARNING THE BASICS Photograph The Tetons-wild , beckoning , and not a creature comfort in sight . // On the third night , I pee into a bottle next to my sleeping bag . Now if only I could figure out the telemark turn . Frankly , how to take care of , umm , personal business had been a secret concern of mine when I signed up for this 10-day backcountry ski course in the Tetons . Ten days is a long time to hold it in . But I 've come to the right place . Nothing is ignored at the National Outdoor Leadership School ( NOLS ) , and nothing is too mundane for discussion . The ideal neck width for a pee bottle ? The right consistency for snow toilet paper ? Both were taught as matter-of-factly as the correct way to use an avalanche transceiver . All this makes NOLS on exceptional place to learn the ins and outs of backcountry skiing . Or , actually , backcountry anything . NOLS is most definitely not a guide service . In fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're damned well going to ski ) . But after 28 years of lift-served skiing , where first tracks are often in short supply , I 'm determined to learn how to make endless powder runs whenever I want , without getting snuffed by an avalanche . Or mortgaging my soul to some heli-ski operation in Canada , eh ? It 's mid-February near Briggs , Idaho , and the temperature outside the NOLS winter base is around 10 degrees Fahrenheit . This is positively balmy-yesterday , on the other side of Teton Pass in Jackson Hole , it was minus14 degrees . Photograph On the crest of a wave in an on ocean of snow . // But I feel cold anyway . And it occurs to me that this could mean when I 'm sleeping in the side of a snowbank I 'll feel ... dead . For these two days , the eight of us who have signed up for the course are bunking down in a converted Mormon church near Driggs , taking telemark ski lessons at nearby Grand Targhee ski area and watching gruesome videos on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if a steep couloir starts to slide , you can sometimes point your boards straight downhill and outrun it until you 're able to pull out a huge super-G turn to safety . I figure if I pull this off , I 'll be going around 70 miles per hour down this steep-say , 50-degree-couloir by the time I make the turn . Bob Beattie 's head will explode . and I 'll get sponsorship from K2 . On the other hand , I pay close attention when we try out our avalanche beacons in the field in back . In all , we 'll probably spend a couple dozen hours working on avalanche skills during this course-enough to make me feel an appropriate mix of confidence and fear in the backcountry . We all posthole slowly through the snow , heads down , searching for buried transceivers-if Prudhoe Bay had an annual Easter egg hunt , it would look like this . Time to go . The sun is shining as we pile into the van for the drive to the trailhead , A about an hour away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet plus , lifts weights daily , and summited Denali last summer . If we get a flat tire , we wo n't need a jack to change itSeth will just bench-press the van . David , a copywriter from Chicago , sits behind us . He 's even larger and somewhat stronger-looking than Seth and probably able to shoulder a minor Teton . I knew that physical conditioning was critical for this trip , so six weeks ago I built from my own fitness base of not going to the gym by starting to watch late-night Abdominizer infomercials . We unload the van , wax up with special blue , and kick and glide slowly into the drainage of South Leigh Creek , which will lead us east and up into the higher elevations of the Tetons .. We each ski slowly past Supy , one of our instructors , so she can make sure our avalanche beacons are transmitting . We 're moving so slowly because of the monstrous packs and sleds we are hauling . I volunteer to take the first turn with the sled that fellow student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morph into one of those suffering , drooling mules that carry people up and down the Bright Angel Trail in the Grand Canyon . After skiing about three miles through gently rolling country , we 've gained just 400 feet . But the hard part is about to come . We stop to attach climbing skins , and I give the sled to Jo . Then we turn to the left and start up the steep , 1,000-foot climb to our first night 's camp . Jo , a personal trainer and nurse who recently moved to Idaho from Tennessee , jogs away up the hill . Somewhere in the back of the group . I ski along with David . David has never skied before , which means he spends a lot of time falling and trying to get up . If the pack-plussled combo turns you into an enslaved mule while you 're skiing , when you fall it transforms you into a deep-sea diver being strangled by a squid . You wrestle to escape from nooselike hip and shoulder straps while flopping helplessly in bottomless powder , stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . Photograph Map-reading skills can mean the difference between skiing down an awesome chute-or admiring it from a few miles away . // David falls a lot . And I 've sat on my butt all winter watching every rerun of The Simpsons . We keep each other company and pull into camp late in the afternoon . Our whole world is snow . I realize this on the first day . At first , all this snow seems misleadingly familiar , like I 'm on the ungroomed side of some Western ski resort , hiking and poling to reach an open bowl . They should really put a T-bar up here . But after a day or two , the real situation starts to sink in . And I am awash in greedy joy . More than 450 inches of snow have fallen this season , and at 12 feet plus , the snowpack is about twice the norm for February . I 'm in the midst of limitless acres , mile after mile of powder that could never all get tracked up , even if we did nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls , and sweeping super-G-sized turns . Finally , I get a bit tired of the snow . It 's embarrassing to admit , but there it is . We stamp down a little space in camp , maybe eight feet by five feet , so we can walk around without sinking in up to our hips . But hanging out is like being in a tiny boat at sea . In order to leave , you need a flotation device-i.e. , your skis-even to piss , even to go over to visit the other cook group next door . We spend eight to ten hours a day on skis . And we sit on snow . We melt snow for water , sleep on snow , cook in a kitchen made of snow , and never dig any hole deep enough to find the ground beneath the ... snow . Thoughts of avalanches start to weigh on me . Beneath its smooth surface , that million tons of awesome powder may be teetering on the edge of stability , waiting for just one more skier to come by before crashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coulee dam decides to burst . The most dangerous slope angle for a slide is about 35 to 40 degrees . The most fun ? The same . I was , briefly , a Peace Corps volunteer . And at times out here in all the snow I feel a hint of near panic like the kind culture shock can bring . I think this feeling has a lot to do with why David leaves the course . Our course is for people over age 25 , so NOLS takes it relatively easy on us . We 're well established in life , after all , and for all they know some of us could be lawyers . So instead of heading right out to sleep in a snowbank , we spend our first two nights in the field in a rented yurt . It 's cush . There 's a woodstove , wooden sleeping platforms , even an outhouse in back . After we 've settled into the cozy confines L of the yurt , Chas , who 's teaching this course along with Supy , moderates a fears-and-goals session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who once captained a frigate , served as a military liaison in Copenhagen , and held briefings with the likes of Cap Weinberger . Our fears : death by hypothermia , death by avalanche , death by gangrenous frostbite-no surprises there . When it comes to goals , the group splits into three categories . There are skiers who want outdoor skills . outdoor people who want ski skills , and a couple of guys-enlightened or misguided , take your pick-ut to have fun and try something new . Photograph After a day in the backcountry , the sunset-and sleep-seem especially sweet . // We have some chuckles . Then someone asks Chas and Supy for their responses . Fear : A student gets killed . Goal : Do n't let the students get killed . Oh . It 's our second day in the field , and David is tired , so tired that he ca n't stay warm , even inside the yurt . The guy 's in great shape , but the **27;1151;TOOLONG routine has been exhausting . David and Chas huddle up on the edge of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour , but I suspect they knew where the conversation was going before it started . David will leave the course . The plan is for Supy and two students-Michael Shashoua and Jo-to ski with David down the mountain and out to the parking lot , where a NOLS van ( summoned by Chas 's cell phone ) will meet them . They 'll split up as much of David 's stuff as possible , so he can ski down relatively unencumbered , while also carrying their own food , water , sleeping bags , shovels , and other emergency gear . Then they 'll turn around and ski back the same day . At around 10:30 in the morning , we shake hands with David , and I watch them ski slowly away . It 's a sad moment ; we all like David a lot . The yurt has been booked by others that night , so the rest of us move further along the ridge and dig out a camp . From this point on , we 're in winter-camping school , and we 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be back until nightfall . We 've got time on our hands . So , someone asks , what about that butt-wiping thing ? " Snow 's the way to go , " Chas explains . " Why , I normally use my snow saw to cut some good snow wedges , and then , why , I ski out a hundred yards or so ... " Photograph Just an average view out the front door . The payoff for paying attention to backcountry lessons : the free ride down . // And Chas , God bless him-naval commander Charles Day , tall , steely gray , the kind of guy central casting wishes it could hire-pantomimes the whole damned process for us . Right there in our snow kitchen . To make sure we 're all okay with it . And , you know ? I do feel better . The following day we ski down o thousand feet through huge , shadowed trees to the next drainage . It 's the snow of my dreams . I could do this every day , even though my sled seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now in the heart of the mountains we came to ski . We struggle up a long , steep ridge through heavy snow and make camp . Then it 's up the next day for a difficult climb to 8,400 feet in a warm storm that leaves us all drenched . We gain elevation slowly : Step . By . Step . I feel a renewed appreciation for lifts : chairlifts , step and pant , T-bars , pomas , step and pant , trams , rope tows , pant , pant , pant , J-bars , step , step , pant . We come to the edge of tree line and stop . The plan is to dig in here for a few nights , skiing and working through more of the avalanche curriculum , and then make our way back out to the road . While the other members of my four-person group start excavating a bedroom , I decide to work on the kitchen . As I unstrap my shovel and expand the handle , I gaze around my building site , imagining the possibilities . The room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining . It should embody elegance , balance , and flair . I construct a recessed kitchen with a large , wraparound counter and a short spiral staircase that widens as it descends . The staircase incorporates a trompe l'oeil-I make the counter narrow seamlessly into the third step from the bottom ; anyone entering from above will feel he is about to step into the soup . The step then widens again and curves back into a long bench . At a soiree the next evening , the kitchen draws accolades . Supy , who until three months ago refused to buy an oven for her house because it would complicate food shopping , seems to be taking mental notes . The evening is a success . Day six in the field , and we 're tired of sleds and heavy packs . But , finally , it 's time to party . The sleds are parked , the packs lightened , and after days of wet storms , this day has dawned clear and beautiful . We 're goin skiing . If we can find the mountain . Jo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first pause to study the map and match the squiggly lines on the page to the squiggly peaks around us . " There 's our peak , " she says . " Straight on : Green Mountain . " " Right , " I concur . " We 'll ski up around that bowl-shaped ridge and come at it from the left . " One of us even gestures with a ski pole . Jo and I are so entranced with our map-reading that at first we do n't notice Supy and Chas suppressing a chuckle on the sidelines . Supy suggests that we move up above the trees so we can see the topography more clearly . We ski up onto a little ridge and look around . Oops . If Jo and I had been leading the Donner party , they probably would have ended up wintering in Arizona on a golf course instead of eating each other in the Sierra Nevada . Okay , so our orienteering skills need some work ( the instructors will give us extra help later ) . Anyway , now pointed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 9,600 feet . We pass through intermediate bowls and little glades-a Vail Resorts ' dream come true-toward the peak , a lumpy mass against the sky . We pause to dig a snowpit to assess the avalanche danger , then emerge onto the final ridge . In a few minutes , we 're on the summit . Photograph Out here in the white world , you ca n't get anywhere or do much of anything without skis . // The summit is an anticlimax . But it 's a bluebird day , and Chas points out the peaks and ranges around us : the Tetons ( which is French for tits ) , the Big Holes , Jackson Hole ( not quite visible ) and the Grand Teton , or Big Tit . Who named these mountains , Larry Flynt ? Supy points out some peaks she 's climbed , and a couple of people pose for snapshots . Then it 's time to ski . I strip off my climbing skins and pack them inside my coat to keep the glue warm . I tighten all the straps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gathering speed . When the track begins to switchback , I peel off into the unbroken snow behind Michael and stop . We watch Supy swoop down the edge of the open slope in elegant arcs below us . " I think we 're going to be disappointed , " Michael says . " What do you mean ? " " I do n't think we 're going to ski the way we 've been imagining . " He 's right . We suck-we 're both fine Alpine skiers , but newbies in the world of free-heel descents . But Michael is wrong , too-we 're not disappointed . With every turn , snow bubbles up against our shins and knees . Every tele turn we make without falling is a triumph , on a slope that would have been a pleasant bore for us on Alpine gear . There 's a slight crust , nothing serious . It 's glorious . And with our new skills , we 're confident this is the start of a beautiful friendship with the backcountry . Eric Nelson , a wiry , 28-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He suddenly appears over the crest of the hill , sewing a tight line of fall-line turns , dropping and rising through each turn like a real skier-ready to be enshrined in a Greg Stump movie . Besides being the best telemarker in the group , Eric 's got an enviable goatee and knows how to drive a combine . There 's an old saw that goes , free the heel , free the mind . Eric watches us make some turns , smiles wryly , and comments : " Lose the heel , lose the mind . " There 's no one , no tracks we have n't made , before us , and the afternoon sun casts glory across the reddening bowls of the enormous amphitheater . The slope holds . And we ski down into camp . <p>
