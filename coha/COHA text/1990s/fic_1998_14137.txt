Time : Early evening . Place : A bare-bones , public-access television studio in Florida . A video camera is mounted on a tripod and aimed at a platform that supports the flamboyant , if limited set for MR . CHARLES ' cable show . There is a suitably fussy folding screen , a small , ornate French writing desk , holding a silver tea service and a floral arrangement , and a gilded , throne-like French chair set center stage . There is a small table beside the chair . Buoyant , big-band theme music is heard , something very upbeat and welcoming . MR . CHARLES enters . He is ageless . He is stylish , haughty , and bold . He wears a fairly obvious , fairly blond hairpiece , a tomato-red blazer over a linen shirt , with an Herms scarf knotted apache-style at his throat , colorful espadrilles , white , lemon , or lime-green slacks , and a necktie knotted as a belt . His face boasts a not particularly discreet coat of moisturizer , bronzer , and a touch of mascara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorator or antiques dealer . He is glorious . After smiling and posing for the audience , MR . CHARLES sits on the throne-like chair . He picks up a letter from the small table . MR . CHARLES ( reading from the letter ) " What causes homosexuality ? " ( He puts down the letter ) I do . I am so deeply homosexual , that with just a glance , I can actually turn someone gay . ( He glances at someone in the audience ) Well , that was easy . Sometimes , for a lark , I like to stroll through maternity wards , to upset new parents . I am Mr. Charles , and I am currently residing here in Palm Beach , in semi-retirement . In exile . You see , I was asked to leave New York . There was a vote . Today 's modern homosexuals find me an embarrassment . This is because , on certain occasions , I take what I call  --  a nelly break . For example : a few months ago , I attended an NYU conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up and said , ( in an earnest , manly voice ) " We must show the world that gay people are not just a pack of screaming queens , with eye makeup , effeminate hand gestures , and high-pitched voices . " And I just said ( He does a nelly break , shrieking and flapping his wrists ) It just happened . I went nelly.Oh , or another time , I was attending a rally . And a woman approached me , and she said , " I would like you to donate five thousand dollars , to support our boycott of Hollywood films which portray homosexuals as socially irresponsible , promiscuous , and campy. " ( another nelly break ) And so , I was asked to leave the city . As revenge , I have begun to broadcast this program on cable channel forty-seven , a show which I call " Too Gay . " It can be found at four A.M. on alternate Thursdays , in between Adult Interludes and Stretching with Sylvia . Poor dear.I would now like to welcome my delicious studio audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience ) And let 's also introduce another popular feature of this program , my devoted companion , Shane . SHANE , a dim , affable , low-rent young hunk enters , wearing a tight tank top , warm-up pants , and sneakers . SHANE eyes the audience and the camera . SHANE and MR . CHARLES get along just great ; they appreciate each other . p. 3 SHANE ( to the audience ) Hey . MR . CHARLES Shane is my ward . I first met him three weeks ago , at a fabulous local nightspot , the Back Alley . Shane was appearing atop a plywood cube . He is a gifted performer . Shane ? SHANE nods and moves downstage so he is standing directly in front of the camera , head down . MR . CHARLES motions to a sound booth , and hot dance music blares . SHANE 's head jerks up , and he begins to dance , first in his version of slow seduction , which quickly explodes into a demented frenzy . MR . CHARLES then motions for the music to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Shane . SHANE You got it . SHANE exits . MR . CHARLES Since I have begun these broadcasts , I have received many letters and postcards , including this telegram , from the National Gay Task Force in Washington . ( He picks up a telegram from the table ) It reads ( reading the telegram ) " Dear Mr. Charles . Stop . " ( He puts down the telegram ) I would now like to answer several of the many queries I have received , regarding homosexuality . Shane ? SHANE enters , now wearing a homemade Robin costume , which includes tight green trunks , a yellow satin cape worn over a tight red tank top , and a black mask . He is not happy about this outfit . He carries a stack of letters , which he dumps on the table . Then he poses , with his hands on his hips , as a superhero. p. 4 SHANE Man , I do n't know about this outfit . MR . CHARLES It does n't bother Robin . SHANE I ai n't Robin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . SHANE I mean , what is the deal with Robin anyway ? MR . CHARLES He 's adorable . SHANE Yeah ? Do you think that Batman and Robin , like , do it ? MR . CHARLES Do you ? SHANE Yeah . I bet that like , after they nail some robbers and save Gotham City , they 're , like , all fired up , so they , like , do some K and stay out all night and then they pick up like , Spiderman  --  he 's hot  --  and the Incredible Hulk , and they all go back to the Batcave and jump in the , like , Bat-jacuzzi , and then Superman flies in and some of the Power Rangers , like the blue one , and the X-Men , and then they all have an orgy and then they see the Bat signal in the sky , only Batman says , fuck , I ca n't fight no more crime , I 'm too wasted . And then they all crack up , and , like , pass out , would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could dress up and go in their place . Only we would fight  --  bad taste . We would burst into people 's homes and proclaim , " We have come to save you ! From that terrible armoire ! " p. 5 SHANE Okay . SHANE exits . MR . CHARLES He hides his pain . ( He picks up a letter ) " Dear Mr. Charles , Is there really a cure for AIDS ? " Well , I 've heard about these new treatments  --  some of my friends are swallowing fifty-eight pills , every day . It 's a tribute  --  to Judy . I swear , only a gay disease could be treated with something called a cocktail . Why not a parfait ? ( He picks up another letter ) " Dear Mr. Charles , Should gays be allowed to serve in the military ? " Oh , no . Congress is absolutely right . You see , I have this military fantasy . Shane ? SHANE enters , now wearing fatigue shorts , an olive-green military tank top , and a military cap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows MR . CHARLES during the next segment , acting as MR . CHARLES ' personal cameraman . MR . CHARLES I 'm serving in Vietnam , with my unit . And one night , I traipse into the shower tent . It 's after hours , and I 'm just wearing my kimono , mules , and a light moisture pack . And I hear the sound of rushing water ( SHANE discreetly makes the sound of rushing water ) and I turn , and there at the end of a row of showers stands a naked marine  --  Colin Powell . His flesh glistens as he lathers up , he runs the soap over his firm chest , his already generous belly , down , down into his manly areas . My breathing grows heavy as my kimono falls from at least one shoulder , and I stand beneath the showerhead beside Colin , attaching my plastic shower caddy , which contains my shampoo , conditioner , finishing rinse , and scented bath gele . My eyes are everywhere , feasting on his shining , sudsy , gleaming male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier , " I murmur . " Do n't you just hate those Vietcong ? " No , darlings , we have no place in the armed forces . Make remarks , not war . Thank you , Shane . SHANE reattaches the camera to the tripod and exits . p. 6 MR . CHARLES ( picking up another letter ) " Should gays be allowed to marry ? " Of course , wealthy older women . ( another letter ) " Can you always tell if someone is gay ? " Well , I can . There 's always a giveaway , sometimes it 's just a glance on a street corner , or a slight moan during oral sex . ( another letter ) " Dear Mr. Charles , I am a lesbian . " Does n't that sound like some marvelous first line from Dickens ? " I am a lesbian . All you do on your show is talk about gay men . What about gay women ? " ( He stands and smiles , very graciously ) Lesbians . I could write a cookbook . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay women as husky , can-do gals out hiking in their flannel and sensible shoes . A gay woman is not simply Paul Bunyan with a cat . ( By this point MR . CHARLES has poured himself a cup of tea from the silver tea service . He notices that SHANE has neglected to provide a lemon wedge on the tray . He calls out , sharply ) Shane ? SHANE hurries in , holding out the lemon wedge , which he squeezes into MR . CHARLES ' cup of tea . MR . CHARLES Danke , Shane . SHANE exits . p. 7 MR . CHARLES Lesbians are charming , endlessly varied people , with all sorts of haircuts , from the flattop to the pixie . I , in fact , have taken a lesbian into my home . She 's asleep in the basement , until Spring . ( another letter ) " How can I raise gay  --  positive children in today 's political climate ? " Well , there are many politically aware children 's books , including Daddy 's Roommate and Heather Has Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this series : My children 's books will include Uncle Patrick Has a Beautiful Apartment and Aunt Cathy 's Large Friend . ( another letter ) Oh look , here 's a letter for Shane . ( He sniffs the letter , which is perfumed ) Oh , Shane ! SHANE enters . SHANE Yeah ? MR . CHARLES ( pointing to the words as he reads ) " Dear Shane . " ( SHANE grins and grunts , very pleased ) " I think that you are the hottest thing in south Florida . I loved you on last week 's show , when you were dressed as Tarzan . " ( The Tarzan outfit was MR . CHARLES ' idea , and SHANE grimaces at the memory . MR . CHARLES is triumphant . ) You see ? " But why do n't you dump Mr. Charles and get your own show ? " p. 8 SHANE ( pleased ) It says that ? MR . CHARLES Well , Shane , do you think you 're ready ? SHANE Well , you know , I 've been thinkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dance , and then ( a big thought ) talk about stuff . MR . CHARLES ( encouragingly ) That 's good . SHANE And then I could , like , put up my beeper number and , like , do this look . MR . CHARLES Which look ? SHANE turns away for a second , and then turns back to the camera , delivering his version of a sultry , orgasmic look . SHANE And I 'd go , I 'm Shane , and I 'm into full body massage , hot oil wrestling , and I 'm an abusive top . MR . CHARLES ( thrilled ) I can see it ! SHANE Oh , and ya know what I wan na call it ? My show ? MR . CHARLES Yes ? SHANE ( a huge thought ) " The Shane Show . " MR . CHARLES By all means ! p. 9 SHANE ( into the camera ) Watch for it ! As SHANE exits , he pauses when standing right in front of the camera , and executes a demented martial arts/karate move , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . MR . CHARLES They grow up so fast . ( another letter ) " Dear Mr. Charles , Do you enjoy gay theater ? " I am gay theater . All right , I will now give you the entire history of American gay theater , in sixty seconds . Go ! MR . CHARLES stands , and there is a dramatic lighting change , as he free-associates rapidly . MR . CHARLES " Jimmy is n't like the other boys  --  do you know what you are  --  he 's no son of mine ! I 'm just so lonely and sick of my own evil  --  he was a boy , just a boy  --  Bill was my buddy , and our love was pure and strong , but those things they 're saying  --  they 're true , about me ! I 'm so sick and ashamed , Karen ! Do you know what you are ? I am a thirty-two-year-old , pockmarked Jew fairy , and that was when my father saw me backstage ; in my wig and my tights , and he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am what I am ! ( in a gravelly voice , as Harvey Fierstein ) I just wan na be loved , is that so wrong ? But Doctor , what 's wrong with David , with all the Davids ? Our people are dying and the Mayor still wo n't even say the name of the disease  --  Maria Callas ! ( He raises his arms as graceful wings ) Let the great work begin ! ( He raises his arms again ) Let the great work begin , part two ! When you speak of gay theater , and you will  --  be kind . Because it 's all about love , valour , and gratuitous frontal male nudity ! SHANE enters , naked , and hands MR . CHARLES a bouquet of roses . p. 10 MR . CHARLES Bravo ! SHANE exits . MR . CHARLES We have now come to my favorite part of the program , a forum which I call , " People I Hate . " This week 's person I hate most in the world is someone I 've never even met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this letter to the editor of our local paper . MR . CHARLES reads aloud from a copy of the newspaper , using a butch voice . MR . CHARLES ( reading from the paper ) " Dear Palm Beach Sentinel , I am a gay man who owns the East Bay Hardware Store . " ( He looks up , with a withering glance , and then continues ) " And I am sick and tired of gay people demanding equal rights when they keep behaving like freaks . As gay people , we must prove that we are n't just stereotypes . We must demonstrate that our lives are normal and wholesome . We must show that we can hold jobs , go to church , and raise children , just like anyone else . That is how we will earn our place at the table . " ( MR . CHARLES puts down the paper . He is now dangerously angry , like steel . ) Darling , I set the table . I arranged the flowers . And I would rather have Shane 's knife at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kind . The nice boys . The good citizens . But please , Mr. DiBenedetto , if you 'd like , by all means , be normal and wholesome and responsible . Get married , have children , move to the suburbs . I 'll wait here . Oh , and Mr. DiBenedetto , by the way MR . CHARLES stands and launches a viciously savage nelly break , directly into the camera . He becomes a ferocious nelly whirlwind , making enormous , flamboyant gestures to the audience . He might look into the camera and elaborately mime applying lipstick and slicking each eyebrow . Finally , he turns , rump to the camera , and minces back to his chair , his heels off the ground , as if he were wearing imaginary spike heels . He turns , sits , and arranges his wrists . With a knife-edge flourish , he crosses his legs . SHANE enters , wearing white jeans and an unbuttoned Versace shirt . p. 11 SHANE Um , I got ta go out , okay ? MR . CHARLES Do you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ! MR . CHARLES Did you take the car keys ? SHANE ( holding up the keys ) Right here ! MR . CHARLES ( like a doting parent ) And all of the cash on my dresser , my credit cards , and my mother 's emerald earrings from my sock drawer ? SHANE Got ' em ! MR . CHARLES Do you love me forever ? SHANE Yeah , of course ! MR . CHARLES ( delighted ) On your way ! SHANE Later ! SHANE exits . MR . CHARLES He 's not fooling me . He does n't need a haircut . Ah , but I am the last of my kind . I shall perish , like the dinosaur . Unless of course , Steven Spielberg discovers some ancient DNA from Paul Lynde and makes more . ( He picks up a final letter ) " Dear Mr. Charles , Have you ever been in love ? " Oh , yes . I fell in love quite early , I must have been , oh , twelve ? I had just been savagely beaten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh , it could 've been anyone . But this was at school . I came home bruised , caked with mud . I ran up to my room , and I looked in the mirror . And I thought , all right , whom would I rather be ? The boys who beat me up , the boys who played baseball and caught frogs and were already losing their figures ? Or would I rather be  --  Mr. Charles . Who even at twelve knew how to turn his face so the tears would glisten . Who knew enough to immediately put Billie Holiday on the hi-fi , and lip-synch . Who could transform a schoolyard humiliation  --  into an Academy Award . And that was when I fell passionately in love  --  with being gay , Oh , there have been men , and boys , and Wedgewood . But being gay  --  there 's a romance . SHANE enters . p. 12 SHANE Um , Chuck ? MR . CHARLES You 're back . SHANE When I was drivin ' to the club , I was thinkin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the show , that you can , like , make people gay , just by lookin ' at ' em ? MR . CHARLES In my time . SHANE Well , I was kinda wonderin ' , I mean , a lotta gay guys have kicked , right ? Which is like , for me , you know , bad for business . I mean , it 's not like Florida 's empty or nothin ' , but what I was thinkin ' is , could you make some more ? To fill the place up ? MR . CHARLES Oh no , I do n't think so , nobody wants to be truly gay anymore . It 's pass . SHANE So , like , kick their ass ! You could do it . Like , make more of you . Use your superpowers . Your gay ray . Make an army . A planet ! MR . CHARLES It 's tempting SHANE Go for it , man ! MR . CHARLES You 're too sweet . SHANE Later ! SHANE exits . MR . CHARLES Well , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more ? ( He looks at the audience ) Yes  --  the receptionist . With the baby . Could you come up here ? The studio RECEPTIONIST comes up onstage , carrying her 7-month-old baby . The receptionist is sweet and apologetic. p. 13 RECEPTIONIST I 'm sorry , my babysitter cancelled , and I had to bring the baby to work . MR . CHARLES How lucky ! What a beautiful child . Boy or girl ? RECEPTIONIST A boy . Max . MR . CHARLES ( to the baby ) How would you like to grow up  --  like me ? How would you like to be  --  Mr. Max ? RECEPTIONIST Can you really make him  --  like you ? MR . CHARLES Is there a problem ? RECEPTIONIST Well  --  will he have a difficult life ? MR . CHARLES Who does n't ? RECEPTIONIST Will people be mean to him , just because he 's gay ? MR . CHARLES ( cheerfully ) Of course . RECEPTIONIST Will he do those  --  nelly breaks ? MR . CHARLES Sometimes  --  in front of your parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding out the baby ) Do it . MR . CHARLES If you insist . MR . CHARLES aims two fingers at the baby and makes a small hissing noise , zapping the baby . p. 14 MR . CHARLES There you go ! RECEPTIONIST Thank you . ( as she exits , to the baby ) He 's a very nice man . MR . CHARLES ( to the mother and child ) Have fun ! He will ! The RECEPTIONIST and baby exit . MR . CHARLES ( to the audience ) Anyone else ? Oh , I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking , oh please , he does n't really have any powers . He 's just another shrill , aging Palm Beach queen with too many cocktails and a bad hairpiece . Well , would you like to hear something even more horrible , my pretties ? It is n't a hairpiece . MR . CHARLES cackles gleefully and gestures grandly to his hair , mouthing the words , " It 's mine . The peppy theme music from his show is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then he begins blowing kisses and waving goodbye , as the lights fade.The following is an alternate , abbreviated ending for this piece . It has been used on occasions when no live baby was available  --  using a doll or a bundle seemed impossibly wimpy . The changes for this version begin just as Shane makes his final exit . MR . CHARLES Oh no , I do n't think so , nobody wants to be truly gay anymore . It 's pass . p. 15 SHANE So like , kick their asses ! You could do it . Like , make more of you . Use your superpowers . Your gay ray . Make an army . A planet ! MR . CHARLES It 's tempting SHANE Go for it , man ! MR . CHARLES You 're too sweet . SHANE Later ! SHANE exits . MR . CHARLES Well , let me see , how would I do this ? Make more ? Well , I am on television . Someone 's watching . There are all those people out there , waiting for Sylvia. ( into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leotards ! Hellow , Florida ! Guess what ? ( He points his fingers at the camera and makes a hissing noise , zapping the viewing audience ) Oh , I know what you 're thinking . You 're thinking , oh please , he does n't really have any powers . He 's just another shrill , aging Palm Beach queen with too many cocktails and a bad hairpiece . Well , would you like to hear something even more horrible , my pretties ? It is n't a hairpiece . MR . CHARLES cackles gleefully and gestures grandly to his hair , mouthing the words , " It 's mine ! " The peppy theme music from his show is heard , and he makes a little pouting face ; then he begins blowing kisses and waving goodbye , as the lights fade .
