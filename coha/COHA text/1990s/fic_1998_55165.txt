GOING DOOR TO DOOR down Zita Street , Molly Andree could see right through most of the houses . They were " shotguns , " in which the rooms lined up like railroad cars , without even a hall . The front room opened into the next one , a bedroom , which led to the next bedroom , then to the kitchen . Molly Andree was soliciting donations for the Society for the Propagation of the Faith , and she carried a dull dark-blue folder that Sister Edwardine had given her , with several sheets of stamps carefully tucked inside . <p> She did not want to sweat on them : then they would all stick together . She did not want to dog-ear them : customers  --  or contributors , more properly  --  deserved perfect stamps in exchange for their donations . The stamps were beautiful . The donations went to save pagan babies , and the stamps pictured , in beautiful brown and gold , crimson and blue , chubby-checked African infants and slit-eyed , gold-skinned Asian babies in beautiful wraps of exotic cloth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stamp money went to support missionaries who ran clean and wonderful orphanages where the babies were saved from their heathen fates . She said their mothers had died from terrible diseases they got from river miasma and witch doctors ' poison-root poultices . <p> A girl in the class had moved to New Orleans from somewhere north , maybe Missouri . She had gone to a Bible church when she was little . She raised her hand and asked Sister Edwardine if they were saving the babies from being passed through the fire . Sister Edwardine said she was not sure what that meant . The girl said she had learned that they used to burn babies up , barbecue , to make the pagan gods happy , that was in the Bible , and did they still do that ? Sister Edwardine shuddered . She did n't know what to say . So she said , " I hope not , " in the same tone she had said , that morning , that she hoped no one would pick their noses or their chickenpox scabs when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl said , " Are we saving those there pagan babies from getting barbecued ? " Sister Edwardine said then she was sure that we were , but she did not sound solid on that . Sister Edwardine was only twenty years old . <p> For each donation of a penny , a donor got one stamp . Molly Andree thought this quite a bargain . Stamps to mail letters cost triple that , and were not beautiful , just dull blue profiles of some dead American president . <p> The houses on Zita Street all were a lusterless , peeling white . They reflected the harsh sun as if they were built of damp chalk . There were no trees , as there was no room for trees . Between houses ran alleyways so narrow that the fat uncle of one of Molly Andree 's classmates had gotten stuck between his own house and his neighbors ' and had to be pried loose by firemen . No one : looked out the windows , because all there was to see were the shutters and curtains of the people next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front to the back . <p> Most of the houses had their front doors open , because it was hot today . It was the second of June , and even though school had closed the week before , Molly Andree had asked Sister Edwardine whether she could please keep collecting for pagan babies and bring what she collected to the convent at the end of the week . She wanted to finish Zita Street , end to end . She wanted to get all the way from the school to her own house on Marillac . She lived on the second floor , over a grocery . <p> Chloe , the black maid , had told Molly Andree that the family 's house had once been the grocer 's family 's house , and that they must have been grand people for their day , to judge from the chandeliers . The rooms were arranged end to end , just the same as the more modest one-story shotguns , but the house was twice as wide , with tall ceilings and those crystal chandeliers with teardrop-shaped crystal hangings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemed to Molly Andree she must be richer than these people in these small shotguns , but she could not see it , did not feel it . She envisioned the rows of darkbrown and pale  --  gold pagan babies , glowing with health on their mission cots , that she would save , and her heart burned with wanting them milkfilled and blanket-wrapped children of God . <p> She climbed the five steps to the next house and knocked on the soft , peeling wood of the doorframe . The door was wide open . The screen smelled of dark rust and bulged out , disfigured , in several places . <p> It was ripped at the corner and taped with shiny gray tape . She peered into the house . It was cool with shade . She could see no one . She called in : " Hello ? Anyone home ? " But the huge window fan kept on making its rubber-belt shucking noise , masking her call . Then a figure moved out of the shadow in the archway into the bedroom , and she caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind that at night in the doorway looked more like a bear 's . <p> For a moment she thought it was her father , and caught her breath again , but the silhouette moved and turned into a rumpled man in belted trousers and a vest undershirt . The man came to the door . His eyes were watery , and he smelled as if he had been working with metal , a whiff of galvanized something  --  nails , fencing  --  that lifted off his skin through the screen . <p> " Would you like to help save pagan babies ? " asked Molly Andree . " On far continents ? " The man blinked , attempting to register this . He seemed still to be thinking about metal fenceposts or garden-gate latches . " I am collecting for the Society for the Propagation of the Faith , " Molly Andree said . " For my class . At Queen of Martyrs School , you know , um , over  --  " she motioned behind her , somewhat grandly , proprietarily , as if she were an explorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy bank to claim this land for some distant monarchy , " over there . " <p> Again the man blinked . " Oh , " he said finally . " Da Catlicks . " <p> Molly Andree blinked in response . She felt as if she were hearing a foreign language , but she knew she was seven blocks from home . <p> " F'om the Catlick school , " said the man . <p> Molly Andree understood . Somehow until now she had thought everyone in the city was Catholic . Even the girl from Missouri was , now . Suddenly she remembered a number of other churches she had seen , the white stucco Presbyterian church with the actual lawn out front , the shadowy little no-color church of some kind on the avenue that she walked past on her way home from school , where the sidewalk was covered with acorns , and where she walked more slowly and crushed them , with great and deep pleasure , with her saddle-oxford heels . <p> " They 're saving the babies , " she said . <p> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unlit living room . " Tell da chile to come in , hoe , " the voice said . " We tryin ' to watch this tiny on da TV . " <p> The man opened the door to let Molly Andree in . On the sofa sat a baggy woman with her hair in a thick pink hairnet . The elastic band bit into the flesh of her forehead . She was obviously this man 's wife : their softnesses , like overcooked vegetables ' in soup , matched . Beside the woman sat a little girl Molly Andree thought probably just short of school age . In a straight-backed rocking chair next to the sofa was a bony grandmother , crocheting a doily and cocking a wiry gray eyebrow to listen . <p> " For every penny you give you get one of these beautiful stamps , " Molly Andree said . " Look . Are n't these beautiful babies ? " <p> " I want them ! " the little girl said . " I want stamps ! " <p> " For what now ? " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " In the Congo and places like that , " Molly Andree said . " It is all very primitive . There are witch doctors and swamp fever , and all the mothers and fathers die . " <p> The little girl 's eyes were wide with wonder . <p> " So all of these babies are orphans , and if you buy stamps  --  or more like , if you give a donation and I give you stamps  --  they have money to save all of these pagan babies . " <p> " Hush , y'all , " said the crocheting grandma . " I ca n't hear the TV man talk . The parade is on . The man 's explaining it . " <p> All eyes turned to the TV , its screen the size of a school notebook page . Indeed there was a parade , dark horses with plumes and coaches like something out of a fairy tale Then Molly Andree remembered : it was the coronation day of the Princess Elizabeth , elegant over the sea in England , where nobody looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had umbrella stands by their front doors , where people drank tea with their pinkies up , and babies rode in mysterious , cozy conveyances called perambulators . Molly Andree had read that in a book and found the idea irresistible . Today Princess Elizabeth , who was barely grown up , would become the queen . Molly Andree had put the coronation out of her mind in her concentration on getting to as many houses as she could . Now she wanted to watch . <p> The soft-vegetable mother saw this in Molly Andree 's eyes . " Sit down , hon. You could watch with us . This here is something . Just think ! She 's getting crowned queen ! Little Princess Elizabeth ! Remember when she was a chile . Look at them horses . So beautiful . " The father sat down by the mother , and Molly Andree sat next to the little girl . <p> The girl snatched a sheet of stamps from Molly Andree and petted them on her lap , running her open hand over the silky stamps , dozens of perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some soft fabric like a nest . Everyone stared at the small television screen . The parade rolled on . There were clop-clopping sounds of horse-hooves and the sounds of herald trumpets in the distance . A commentator was talking about other times like this , the crownings of other queens and kings  --  in England and the rest of the world . <p> Molly Andree had a vision of herself as Princess Elizabeth , with all the wealth of the world  --  or whatever kingdom or queendom England was part of  --  at her fingertips . She would ride in that carriage on Sundays , with its top down  --  she could not imagine it raining on Sunday in England  --  collecting all the pagan babies from all the homes where the mothers and fathers had died , and she would bring them to the palace . They would each have a perambulator and a nanny . <p> She would not be as beautiful as her own mother , who everyone said looked like Joan Fontaine , though she would have long braids wound about her head as Joan Fontaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be as little as Princess Elizabeth . She would be tall like her father , too tall for anyone to want to marry , which would be just fine , and her face would be not like her mother 's or father 's but honest and shining as that of Sister John Vianney , the nun who taught the other third grade and knew how to make flower crowns for May processions . She would probably be something like a nun herself , a queen without a prince-husband or king-husband . <p> She would eat creole cream cheese with a silver spoon for breakfast every day . Her initials would be on the spoon , whose handle would be as ornate as her best special-occasion crown , not the crown she would wear every day . She would take turns relieving the nannies with the perambulators , each of them bearing the royal crest  --  she could not quite picture this , as she did not quite know what perambulators looked like  --  and wear her everyday crown walking the babies in the royal gardens . She would always be twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps if there were too many orphans she would sell her crowns and wear floral coronas like Sister Vianney 's . <p> On the television they were coming to someplace . The carriages were pulling into a grand driveway . <p> " Get me my pills , " said the grandmother . Molly Andree looked over at her . It was unclear who was being addressed . Molly Andree looked back at the television . " I said get me my pills , " the grandmother repeated . No one else moved . Molly Andree stood up and looked a question at her : where ? The woman gestured toward the sideboard . There were piles of bills , a vase of pink plastic roses with a coating of fine , fuzzy dust , and several brown medicine bottles . Molly Andree walked to the sideboard and picked all the bottles up between her hands . The grandmother made a sound of disgust , as if she should have known which bottle . Making a slight curtsey , Molly Andree set the bottles down . She did not know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The coronation party was processing into a grand doorway . The cameras shook slightly , and there were too many shadows to see clearly just what was happening . <p> " How do they save them , these babies ? " the father said . <p> Molly Andree realized that she did n't know . She made a face of stupidity . She tried to think of a logical answer . She did n't want to attempt to explain about barbecue , because she was n't sure that was the answer . Instead , she said , " Each of these sheets is worth fifty cents . Five rows of ten . " <p> The father shrugged and seemed somehow satisfied . <p> Molly Andree wanted to stay here and turn into a fat cooked cross-section of carrot in the soup of this family . She wanted to be Queen Elizabeth , or one of the pagan babies . She did not want to go home . Her mother would be out getting a manicure and would come home with glistening dark-red nails . Chloe did not come today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big and too empty this afternoon . She could not tell when her father would come home . He sold cars in a big , shiny showroom , and you never could tell what his hours would be . She moved closer to the little girl , who smelled like fruity shampoo . <p> On the TV , the procession seemed to have gotten somewhere , the scene of the real action . <p> " Do you want to play tea party ? " said the little girl . <p> " No , thank you , " said Molly Andree . <p> The little girl nodded , pleased , as if she had said yes , and went and got small plastic cups with blue flowers and green leaves on their sides . She went into the kitchen and brought back a bottle of root beer . She handed it to Molly Andree . <p> " It 's hot , " Molly Andree said . " Root beer 's supposed to be cold . " <p> " That 's all right , " said the girl . " We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have an opener anyway , " said Molly Andree . <p> The girl went to the kitchen and brought back an opener . Its handle was pearlized and said JAX BEER in beautiful scrolly-script letters . Everyone else watched the TV , absorbed . Molly Andree wrenched the top from the root beer as if she were an expert . She had never opened a bottle alone before . The liquid frothed up and spilled hot root-beer bubble-drool onto the worn flowered rug . No one cared . Princess Elizabeth was being crowned . <p> Molly Andree and the little girl drank their hot root beer from doll cups . " Delicious , " the little girl said , smacking her lips delicately . She seemed to be more truly Molly Andree 's small sister than these vegetable-soup people 's daughter . Perhaps if she could not be crowned Queen of England , Molly Andree would run away to Chloe 's house in the batture at the bend in the river behind the church , the dried-mud wilderness between the first levee and the disaster levee . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed away . But in the meantime , the three of them could be quite happy . <p> One day a couple of months before , Molly Andree had been helping Chloe spring-clean the chandeliers . This involved three buckets  --  soap-water , rinse-water , vinegar-water  --  and old diapers that had to have been Molly Andree 's own , dug from some remote closet to wipe and polish the dangling crystals . Molly Andree stood in her sock-feet on the dark , heavy dining-room table , taking down the crystals , hook by hook . The wood of the table felt waxy and dangerous through her socks . <p> She thought she might slip , hit her head , and die . She wondered whether there would be a funeral , as she was sure that no one but Chloe would come  --  her mother did not like funerals , and her father had to work almost every day  --  and she was not sure Father Bergeron would let a colored girl into his church . Chloe sat at the end of the table and dunked the crystals in soap-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then in vinegar-water . " And what is the vinegar-water for ? " Molly Andree asked , a dozen crystals into the chandelier . " Sparkle , " said Chloe . " Shine . After that vinegar gone , you see . That when it squeak . When it shine . " <p> When Chloe went into the kitchen to dump the rinse-water , Molly Andree stuck a sharp-faceted , vinegar-wet crystal into her mouth and sucked all the vinegar off , as if perhaps she were a two-year-old or did not know any better . Chloe came back quicker than Molly Andree expected and saw her pulling the long , fat crystal dangler , pensive and slow , from her mouth . She shook her head . " You one crazy white child , " Chloe said . Then she laughed very big , and Molly Andree admired the rosy skin inside her mouth and the grand , solid ivory sheen of her teeth . After they finished the chandelier , Chloe went home . Before her parents returned from whatever they were doing , separately , Molly Andree turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flashlight through the crystals , dazzling the glass in the dark . <p> Molly Andree and the little girl were drinking tea-set cup after cup of lukewarm root beer and saying , " Dee-lee-ci-ous ! " in unison as all this went through her head . On the television the coronation continued . " What is she sitting on ? " the little girl squealed . " A potty ? " She clapped her hands in great glee at seeing a princess on the toilet on television . <p> The grandmother snorted in disgust . The father said , " They call that thing a throne , honey . " The mother , distracted , said , " What did she say ? Her throat ? Her throat hurts ? " No one answered . <p> Molly Andree remembered a dream she had had the week before . In the dream she had something in her mouth , and she did not know what it was . It felt like a stone , but it was too smooth , more like glass , like an egg , like an egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked at it . It seemed that there was something inside , but in the dream she would not be permitted to know what that was until she had sold all her stamps . <p> Princess Elizabeth 's crown looked far too big for her . Or , Molly Andree thought , if she had that crown already on her head perhaps she was n't Princess Elizabeth anymore . " Queen " seemed less lovely somehow . For a moment Molly Andree resolved that she would not metamorphose to Queen after she was transformed into Princess . But then there was something awry in that , she could n't figure what . <p> She looked into the bedroom of the vegetable mother and vegetable father . An overbright picture of Jesus as the Sacred Heart hung above their bed . Gold beams like spikes of a porcupine radiated from his very pink heart , which was the color of cube steak , raw . The bedspread was pink chenille and had a design of orange flowers with green leaves worked into the center of it . The pillows looked flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She thought of her mother 's bedroom with its quilted silk coverlet , its throw-pillows like valentine hearts plumped in a careful pile against the pickled-oak headboard . She looked at the cube-steak heart of Jesus over the little girl 's mother and father 's bed . <p> Her own father slept on the far side of the stairs , in the room she called the Scary Room . They had once had a boarder , a middle-aged woman named Mrs. Hodge who smelled like disinfectant and Pepto-Bismol , who had died there . She had been Christian Scientist . She had made a point of telling that fact to Molly Andree one morning when they met by accident in the kitchen . She said Christian Scientists did not take medicine . Molly Andree asked well then what about Pepto-Bismol ? Mrs. Hodge said , as if it should be obvious , that was on a par with cough drops , which were pretty much just hard candy , and so the rule did not apply . Mrs. Hodge very rarely came into contact with the rest of the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgency , receiving no mail , never needing to use the phone . <p> Molly Andree had seen her  --  again , by accident  --  one day when she had gone downtown on the Saint Charles streetcar to meet her mother at Godchaux 's . Her mother wanted to buy her a nylon seersucker dress she had seen in the department store window on a mannequin with a blond pageboy hairdo . The dress was printed with tiny crowns and fleurs-de-lis . Molly Andree felt perfectly indifferent about the dress , though she tried it on and twirled for the salesgirls as her mother asked , and she could tell that her mother was quite disappointed in her . As the streetcar passed , Molly Andree saw Mrs. Hodge standing outside the Christian Science Reading Room with her umbrella half unfolded , looking up at the sky . Then the streetcar moved on toward Lee Circle . <p> Mrs. Hodge had caught cancer and died . No one would tell Molly Andree how one could catch cancer . Chloe said she did n't know , that colored people probably did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She regaled Molly Andree with the story of a growth on the side of the face that her uncle in Opelousas had had , and the two-headed baby that got stuck and killed her aunt Bertholine . <p> Mrs. Hodge refused to call a doctor . She just lay in that room getting smaller until finally Molly Andree 's mother called the hospital and told them to come get Mrs. Hodge , that she just could n't stand all this Christian Scientist business one minute more . <p> She went into Mrs. Hodge 's room and told her in no uncertain terms that the ambulance was coming . Mrs. Hodge made a very small puckered mouth . Her eyes shrank and darkened with anger or some kind of bedridden Christian Scientist resolve . Molly Andree 's mother had Chloe pack Mrs. Hodge a bag . " Any bag , " she said to Chloe , in clear earshot of Mrs. Hodge . " I just want her out of here . " <p> Molly Andree and her mother and Chloe sat in the dining room and played cards on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Molly Andree knew her mother had to be very upset if she would resort to such a measure . Asking the maid to play gin rummy with them when the ironing was piled high in both baskets and Chloe had just cooked a new batch of pale-blue starch in the aluminum pot on the stove made no sense otherwise . <p> Molly Andree liked the scraping sound of the wooden spoon on the pot-bottom as Chloe heated the starch . She had sat at the table listening to it , pretending to be busy with spelling words . She wrote them out ten times each : ache , cable , mountain . She knew them already but did n't mind practicing penmanship . Her mother had an autographed eight-by-ten glossy photo of the dimple-faced , swaggering Clark Gable hung on her bedroom wall . It was good to have penmanship skills . One might someday be Vivien Leigh , or the Princess of England , and have to sign who knew what . <p> Mrs. Hodge had been dead when the ambulance came , as ferocious as that . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Molly Andree 's mother told her the plans for the hospital seemed to have grown , become a dark vacuum , and swallowed her whole . She lay dead on the bed looking straight at the door with her eyes open , furious . Molly Andree 's mother had sucked her breath in and let her knees go out from under her . The ambulance attendants assisted her to her heart-pillowed bed at the far end of the house , and then took Mrs. Hodge 's body away . <p> Molly Andree 's father slept in Mrs. Hodge 's old room now . Her mother said it was better that way , so he would n't wake her when he left very early or came in late . The Lysol and the pink , minty medicine smell of Mrs. Hodge were not totally gone , but remained , ineradicably Christian Scientist or something like it , in an ethereous layer beneath the scents of her father 's hair wax and shave lotion , which filled the first layer of the air of the room now . Sometimes her father asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She recalled stepping into the room twice or three times , but just stepping into it , not talking , not anything else except the sound of the lock clicking behind her . <p> In back of Princess Elizabeth  --  now apparently queen  --  stood a dozen or so dignitaries . One was jut-jawed and ecclesial , cloaked in brocade , a great cross hanging clown on his belly . Several wore ermine about their shoulders ; some had crowns of various sorts ; one seemed to be holding a sword erect in an uncomfortable way . <p> The grandmother balanced herself on her elbow on the chair arm , lifting her bony left buttock off the seat , and released a long , terrible flatulent bleat . The mother and father kept watching the TV . The little girl looked over at Molly Andree and made a gagging face , waggling her tongue in disgust . The room filled with the smell , which resembled the odor Mrs. Hodge 's room had had in late morning when she left the door open to air it out . <p> Molly Andree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen of the TV . The man behind the new queen had a face like her father 's . Her heart skipped a beat . She remembered the time  --  when ? Mrs. Hodge was already dead , she knew that  --  in the dark **26;790;TOOLONG garage when her father had come up behind her in his boxer shorts without making a sound . <p> Molly Andree had been looking for a small can of green paint to retouch a worn spot on her dollhouse roof . Her mother was at the hairdresser 's , and it was Chloe 's day off . She remembered her father 's hand coming flat over her mouth . There were calluses on his palm , and she felt them like horn or sandpaper against her cheek . <p> She remembered the clammy feel of the skin of his belly as he forced her hand down inside the waistband of his shorts . She remembered the sweet , awful floury smell of his parts , which she never had seen or remembered she 'd seen , only inches away from her face as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show him the cavity  --  lower left  --  that had been filled with cool silver the previous week . She remembered him calling her Princess . And that was all she remembered . <p> Next to her on the sofa , the little girl squirmed . The grandmother 's fart still lingered , and the porcupine heart of the front-bedroom Jesus was all she could see . It filled her eyes . Something filled her own heart : a desire to stay very small , to grow smaller , to become twins with this little girl , to shrink to the size of the black pupils of Mrs. Hodge lying dead on her bed , to vanish . She felt her throat tighten . <p> She wanted to grow up , but of all the grownups she knew , only Chloe was worth growing up to be , and she could n't grow up to be Chloe . <p> " I guess I should go , " she said to the parents . Her voice did not sound like her own , or as if it meant anything of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and offer to help , some way , any way . Maybe she could bring the grandmother medicine all day long . She wanted them to ask her to stay , to adopt her . Queen Elizabeth moved forward , her skirts and cloak stately , her crown still too large , and all the courtiers moved as one with her . The man who looked like Molly Andree 's father was nowhere to be seen . Molly Andree thought , yes , she would like to be queen . <p> The father said , " Hey , femme buy some a dem stamps off a you . " He gave Molly Andree a quarter . <p> She laid all the stamps she had on the coffee table , several sheets . There was no set price , really , so this was technically OK . They were all sold , if she 'd sell them that cheap . That would be a relief . She was sure God could save all the pagan babies in French Equatorial Africa with just one quarter if he so desired . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , the screen door squeaked slowly and stopped before closing completely . Looking back , she saw the mother and father and little girl leaning forward to look at the beautiful sheets of stamps she had left for them . The grandmother was squawking that she could n't see , let her see , let her see . On the TV , Elizabeth , Queen of the Empire , would be climbing into her coach , going home to a new life . <p> Molly Andree turned left , toward Chloe 's house . She would wait there , sitting quiet and still on the low , squeaky bed until Chloe came home , in the dusk . There were no lights in her little shack , no electric wires . Molly Andree would sit in the semi-dark , breathing the comforting smells of molasses , moss mattress , and the very heavy old coverlet , which smelled as human as anything ever could . She could get in with no problem . She had been to Chloe 's house many times . Chloe 's house had no locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HILL <p>
