Whitney Houston returns to the concert stage to kick off her first world tour in five years . // After a five-year absence from the concert stage , Whitney Houston recently kicked off a sold-out coastto-coast tour , thrilling fans with a mixture of current and vintage tunes . The Whitney Houston World Tour ' 99 kicked off at Chicago 's 4,000-seat Arie Crown Theater-a small venue by Houston 's standards . In fact , the most noticeable difference between this tour and her previous engagements is the difference in the size of the venues . Previously , she performed before packed houses at large arenas like New York 's Madison Square Garden and the Hollywood Bowl , both with capacities around 18,000 . But , not for this tour . " I 've turned down a lot of arena dates because I 've done the big-arena thing , " she said . " Now , I want to do something where people can feel me and I can feel them . This show is going to have a jam-session kind of feel . " And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she is now . " The last time I toured was just before I 'd had my baby , " she told JET . " I 'd just come off The Bodyguard . It rocketed , I got pregnant , had a baby . Everything happened so fast . It was too much to take at the moment . Thank God for my husband ( singer Bobby Brown ) . There was a lot of success at a very important time in my life . I think then I was more in wonder of what was going to happen . " But not now . Now , she says , she feels good about herself and her life . " I 'm older , a wife , a mother . I know what I 'm doing . I 'm so glad I 'm past the I-don't-know stage . I feel good . I feel secure . We put this show together based on me then and now . So , everybody gets that piece of then , plus now . I 'm glad they 're enjoying it . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work hard and put my best into it . " She is surprised about the fact that she 's in smaller venues ( averaging between 4,000 and 6,000 seats ) is becoming such a major issue . She said she loves the intimacy of the smaller venues because " they can see me . And I can see them . " " Why are people so surprised ? " she told the Boston Herald . " I 'm not crazy about arenas just because I can sell them out . It does n't do anything for my ego at all . I want to play places where people do n't have to sit in the nosebleed seats and wonder what the hell is going on . This is about playing places people can actually feel you , can actually know what you 're wearing , what clothes you have on . " On the tour , she 's sporting clothes by in-crowd designers Dolce &; Gabbanna . Fans lucky enough to get tickets are seeing a Whitney Houston who 's not only relaxed , but witty and playfully interacting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is mixing up the show with about half the songs coming from her latest album My Love Is Your Love , and the remainder such crowd-pleasing hits as Saving All My Love , How Will I Know and I Will Always Love You . She told reporters that she has to sing the vintage hits . " Those songs brought me here . Ill do them forever . " Photograph Whitney sizzles during her hot performances . She dishes out a mixture of current and vintage tunes that leave her soldout audiences on cloud nine . // She told the New York Daily News that all of the old songs had special meaning for her . " When I did Saving All My Love , I was going through a terrible love affair . He was married , and that will never work out for anybody . Never , no way . Forget about it . " Fans also are treated to the new hits from her 3 million copy-selling album My Love Is Your Love , such as Heartbreak Hotel and It 's Not Right But It 's Okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her recent album has much more of a mix of RB and hip hop to it . Not one to risk stagnation and get locked into one specific genre of music , Whitney told JET she embraced hip hop because that 's where music is now . " Today , it 's hip hop . Hip hop has taken over . With every race , creed and color , it 's taken over . It 's what it 's about . But fans still want to hear lyrics . I have a generation of 2- , 3- , 4and 5-year-olds who look at me and see the Fairy Godmother ( from the ABC movie Cinderella ) . I have a generation of people who know me from the 1980s and a generation from now who know me from It 's Not Right But It 's Okay . I 'm not suffering . " Photograph The superstar performer opted to perform at smaller venues rather than large arenas for this world tour because she loves the intimacy of smaller venues . aI want to do something where people can feel me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tour is the result of market forces . " You go according to what people dictate . They like it ; they want to hear me . I put the tickets on sale and they bought them . " And it 's no coincidence that Houston 's current tour began when the school year ended . It was scheduled that way so that her 6-year-old daughter , Bobbi Kristina , could tour and get on the stage with her . Bobbi Kristina comes out on the stage when her mother sings the title track from My Love Is Your Love . She implores the crowds to clap their hands and get involved in her mother 's music . When Whitney takes the tour to Europe at the end of August , Bobbi Kristina will accompany her mom , but just for a brief period . " She 's going to do two weeks with me in Europe before going back to school . I 'm going to take her with me so that she and I can prepare ourselves for the parting . So , she 'll do the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in first grade . I 'll be back home four weeks after she starts first grade . So , I 'm preparing myself . It 's tough . One of us has to be home when the other 's away . When I 'm away , Bobby 's home , and when he 's away , I 'm home . He 's home during the European leg . " On and off the concert stage , Whitney said she 's enjoying herself more than ever before . " You do n't realize it until you 're older . When you 're older , you learn what it 's about to relax and enjoy . You 're not so young , not so eager . Some of the mistakes you made are gone . They 're over ! You move on . I 'm glad to be where I am right now . I 'm glad to be 35 . I do n't want to be 28 , 26 , 25 or 24 . I do n't want to be anything . I 'm glad I 'm in my 30s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . I would 've known not to make the mistakes I made . I 'm comfortable now . I 've been truly blessed . " Photograph With a smorgasbord of tender ballads and dance grooves , Whitney has her fans begging for more during her electrifying performances . // <p>
