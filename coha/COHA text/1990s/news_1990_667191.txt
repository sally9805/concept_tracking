<p> Saturn , General Motors Corp . ' s answer to the foreign automakers that have been eating into its market share , goes on sale today . After waiting seven years , prospective buyers might have to wait a little longer for a test- drive . Reason : Saturn has just 29 dealerships . <p> Saturn hits the road today . <p> The new small cars from General Motors Corp . go on sale initially at 29 showrooms in 10 states ; 100 more showrooms will be spread across 29 additional states by the middle of next year . GM has bet seven years and $ 3.5 billion that the pundits are wrong ; that a U.S. car company - using U.S. brains and brawn - can , in fact , design , build and sell small cars head-to- head with Japan . <p> Driving reviews have been lukewarm . Industry analysts have plenty of doubts . Rivals say they are n't worried . <p> So the early signals are negative - except ... <p> " We 've had people in here all week looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really want to buy an American-made car and they need a reason . This car could be the reason , " says Virginia dealer Haywood " Huddy " Hyman at Saturn of Richmond . <p> " There 's an anti-Japanese sentiment in this country , an under-the-surface patriotism threatening to come out any second . A good , strong American small car would sell like hot cakes , " says Jean Lindamood , executive editor of Automobile magazine . <p> " From what I 've seen so far , it 's not about cars . It 's about the American people building a car that can compete in a world market , " agrees Florida dealer Mark Belviso , manager at Saturn of Clearwater . " The people who 've come in here to look are proud that Saturn comes from Tennessee . You can see it in their faces . " <p> One of those faces belongs to Tom Noe , 77 , of Largo , Fla . " They really got something here , " he says . " It 's about time the USA got into the small- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer . " Noe , who drives a Buick LeSabre , was merely curious when he stopped at Saturn of Clearwater . Now , he 's a potential customer : " I 'm very favorable . I could entertain the idea of trading . " <p> Saturn plans to start slowly , selling about 50,000 cars in the first 12 months . When the Spring Hill , Tenn. , factory is cranking away on two shifts - presumably some time next year - it could build 240,000 cars per year . If dealers sell all those , Saturn would be among the 10 best-selling cars in the USA . <p> Even the harshest critics agree that Saturn cars have very strong points . They offer the crisp handling that makes small imports endearing . They are put together with great care . They are priced right ; most will sell for $ 10,000 to $ 12,000 . And they offer impressive fuel economy - up to 37 miles per gallon on the highway - to calm oil-worried consumers . <p> Nonetheless , Saturn is vying for the prize that Detroit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Japanese-car buyers . And it is doing so - even Saturn admits - with incredible audacity . <p> " Here we are , a brand-new car company . A lot of people never heard of Saturn , and if they did , it was something they read about and they vaguely remember . Why would I want to buy a car from a company I do n't even know ? " acknowledges Saturn President Richard " Skip " LeFauve . " It 's a very realistic issue . " <p> Front-wheel drive Saturns - base priced from $ 7,995 for the four-door SL sedan to $ 11,775 for the sporty SC coupe - must leap major hurdles to galvanize early showroom enthusiasm into long-term victory : <p> - A slow , glutted market . " It is just another small car in an incredibly crowded market , heading into what could be a really nasty recession , " warns auto analyst Joseph Phillippi at Shearson Lehman Bros . The low-priced Saturn is aimed at " the guy who is going to be the first one laid off " if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year 's . Consumers seem immune to automotive temptations , even fat rebates - a feature Saturn swears it wo n't have . On the other hand , Saturn dealers have slightly bigger profit margins than is typical for small cars , to motivate them and give them room to dicker , if necessary . If Saturn is an instant hit , dealers promise not to ruin it by profiteering . " We 're really pleased with the profit margin and the price . We wo n't add a markup , " says Tennessee dealer Jerry Hodge , president of Saturn of Knoxville , a three-hour drive from the factory . <p> - Fresh rivals . The cars that shoppers will compare to Saturn have just been redesigned or soon will be . Ford 's roomy new 1991 Escort debuted last spring ; Mazda 's well-regarded Protege is a new design ; Nissan 's low-priced Sentra just got an overhaul and features a much peppier engine than most . <p> Saturn 's main targets - the Honda Civic and Toyota Corolla - get overhauls next fall , at the start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gets such a radical re-do that " Saturn is old news , " Phillippi says . <p> " Saturn is not the equal of the next generation Corolla and Civic . Their interiors will be much more sophisticated , updated . And the Civic will be bigger , roomier and have a more-powerful engine , " says Christopher Cedergren , analyst at auto research firm J. D. Power and Associates . <p> The ever-optimistic LeFauve says the tough league is a boon . " As we become a success in the market , people ca n't say it is because we were competing against old cars . " <p> - Safety concerns . At a time when air bags are trendy , Saturn has none , and wo n't until 1994 . Planners did n't foresee the explosion in popularity of the safety devices , which cushion occupants in head-on crashes . The ' 92 Civic , on sale a year from now , is expected to have both a driver 's and passenger 's bag . And Chrysler 's small cars , the Shadow and Sundance , have driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , or ABS , is available on Saturns - a rarity on small cars . But ABS costs $ 875 - pricey to many buyers in the Saturn range . " Bad move , " says Cynthia Certo , analyst at auto consultant Integrated Automotive Resources . Cheap ABS - " even if they made no money on it " - would have been a marketing coup that outweighed the lack of air bags . <p> - Internal rivalry . Do n't expect other GM divisions to surrender their small-car sales to Saturn just to keep peace in the family . Most vulnerable at first : GM 's Chevrolet Cavalier and Chevy 's Geo Prizm , which is based on the Toyota Corolla . They are about the same size and price as Saturn . Chevy boss J. C. " Jim " Perkins says Chevy is heavily promoting its Geo models and has an " aggressive game plan " to support the Cavalier , currently the third- best selling car in the USA . It has n't changed much since it was introduced in 1982 , so Chevy has recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big discounts to keep Cavalier sales strong . Saturn says 80% of its sales should come from outside GM ; dealers are n't sure . " I think we 'll get a lot of loyal GM owners , " predicts Hodge , at Saturn of Knoxville . " As the car makes a name , we 'll cut into the import market , but that 'll be a slow process . " <p> - No track record . Saturn is an unproven brand , using unusual manufacturing processes and hardware not shared with any other GM car . Combine that with buyers ' chariness about first-year models and there are plenty of question marks to dissuade shoppers . To lessen the risk , Saturn promises buyers all their money back if they decide they do n't like the car within 30 days . <p> Saturn 's ultimate selling point is likely to be the window sticker . Says Cedergren : " It 's not a Honda or Toyota , but price is the equalizer . You can get a decent car for 10,000 bucks . That 's fabulous .
