The increasingly pluralistic nature of the American educational system underscores the need for educators to be aware of cultural differences as they relate to learning . The parity between the academic achievement of African American and White children may be explained in part by the lack of institutionalized educational support for the varied approaches African American students may take to learning . African American learning styles are highlighted and the implications for teachers are discussed . <p> Historically , the African American student has tended to be maligned by the American educational system . There have been many theoretical suppositions as to why this group of students has been labeled not only different , but inferior . These suppositions arise from the beliefs of a society that serves to promote what Schofield describes as the YAVIS syndrome , or the values of young , attractive , verbal , intelligent , and successful individuals ( cited in Sue and Sue , 1990 ) . African Americans , presently the largest ethnic minority group in the United States , have systematically and consistently been relegated to the periphery of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumptions highlighting the differences between African American and White children , as opposed to searching for valid explanations for these differences . Misrepresentations such as these have been especially pronounced in the area of cognition within the educational sphere . <p> The purpose of this manuscript is to foster an awareness of the learning styles of African American children . First , a brief history of the views on cognitive functioning and learning styles of African American children will be presented . Second , current perspectives on African American learning styles and cognitive functioning will be detailed . Finally , the implications these learning styles have for the multicultural classroom will be described . History of the Theoretical Views of the Learning Styles of African American Children <p> The misconstruction of the more holistic cognitive tendencies of African Americans in an analytically oriented school system has periodically given rise to prejudicial hypotheses . Socioeconomic concerns were brought to the fore of America 's consciousness during the Civil Rights Movement of the mid 1960s ( Banks , 1993 ) . The educational system sought to explain the academic achievement of indigent students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African American . Their efforts yielded such constructs as cultural deprivation and cultural differences . <p> The cultural deprivation theory became pronounced in the 1960s and early 1970s and stated that underachievement in the African American community was related to a lack of proper socialization skills . It was believed that the African American culture was deficient because many of the values , beliefs , and behaviors exhibited were dissimilar to those of the White culture . This mode of thought began to receive less attention due to the assumption that children needed to obtain middle class accoutrements if their culture was to be validated . <p> During the 1980s , the cultural differences theory was embraced , whereby differences were not viewed as deficiencies .. This theory acknowledged the role of the child 's socioeconomic status ( Banks , 1993 ) . The cultural differences theory contended that the world view of African Americans was legitimate and need not be considered relevant only in comparison to White American values ( Sue &; Sue , 1990 ; Willis , 1989 ) . <p> The cultural differences theory was in direct contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America ( Anderson , 1988 ) . Due to this discrepancy , the African American child clearly would be in the more disadvantaged learning position ( Banks , 1993 ; 1988 ) . <p> Banks ( 1993 ) reports that this pluralistic mode of thought , promoted by the cultural differences theory is once again being overshadowed by the deprivation paradigm . Evidence of this position is supported by the introduction and frequent use of the label " at-risk . " At-risk describes children who are different in many ways . In addition , like cultural deprivation , its definition is imprecise . Culture and Learning Styles <p> Discussions of " culture " and " learning styles " are essential to understanding how African American children learn . Shade ( 1989 ) elaborates on Madhere 's ( 1989 ) definition of culture by defining it as " a group 's preferred way of perceiving , judging , and organizing the ideas , situations and . events they encounter in theft daily lives " ( p. 9 ) . She further explains that cultures may maintain specific religious orientation , language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressive methods of their perceptions of the world ( i.e. , art , music , dance ) . Guidelines used by individuals to select information to which they attend and to interpret given information are also determined by culture . It is only natural to assume that culture would affect how children learn . <p> Research proponents in the area of individual differences are now looking at the manner in which children learn ( Castaneda &; Gray , 1974 ; Cohen , 1969 ; Shade , 1982 , 1993 ) . Learning style , as defined by the National Task Force of Learning Style and Brain Behavior ( cited in Bennett , 1990 ) defines the construct <p> that consistent pattern of behavior and performance by which an individual approaches educational experiences . It is the composite of characteristic cognitive , affective , and physiological behaviors that serve as relatively stable indicators of how a learner perceives , interacts with , and responds to the learning environment . It is formed in a deep structure of neural organization and personality which molds and is molded by human development and the cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 94 ) <p> There is an existing , albeit not wholly understood relationship between learning styles and culture ( Bennett , 1986 ; Castaneda &; Gray , 1974 ; Hernandez , 1989 ) . The concept of culture envelopes the values , customs , beliefs , communication patterns , and aesthetic standards which have been passed from one generation to the next ( Parillo , 1990 ) . These particular dimensions serve as a cohesive cultural force , which , in turn , help to define the behavior of a society ( Parillo , 1990 ) . Anderson ( 1988 ) contends that as the cultures of ethnically distinct communities vary , so do the differences in their learning styles . Current Perspectives on African American Learning Styles and Cognition <p> It has been suggested that African American learning styles have been influenced by cultural customs transposed from specific communities in Africa . Both the African American church and family have been highly influential in perpetuating these learning styles ( Anderson , 1988 ; Hale-Benson , 1986 ) . <p> Willis ( 1989 ) reviewed Africentric psychology literature in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the following four characteristics : Social/Affective : people-oriented , emphasis on affective domain , social interaction is crucial , social learning is common . Harmonious : interdependence and harmonic/communal aspects of people and environment are respected and encouraged ; knowledge is sought for practical , utilitarian , and relevant purposes ; holistic approaches to experiences ; synthesis is sought . Expressive creativity : creative , adaptive , variable , novel , stylistic , intuitive , simultaneous stimulation is preferred ; verve ; oral expression . Nonverbal : nonverbal communication is important ( intonation , body language , etc. ) , movement and rhythm components are vital . ( p 54 ) <p> Other reports on the learning style of African American children discuss its cognitive dimension . Cognitive styles suggest the manner in which children perceive and process information ( Hernandez , 1989 ; Woolfolk , 1993 ) . Madhere ( 1989 ) proposes that preferential treatment given to the differences between the African American and White intellects has negatively influenced information in the areas of learning styles and cognitive because of its traditionally unidimensional focus . In his criticisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus only on small areas of cognitive performance , to the exclusion of areas of significance to ethnic minority cultures . He also states that models of intelligence do not focus on the abilities of persons to perform diverse tasks , preferring to highlight insignificant , unidimensional individual tasks . Lastly , Madhere questions the popular notion that there is a single concept of intelligence , one which is narrow in scope and hierarchically determines an individual 's rank . This position is supported by Axelson ( 1993 ) who asserts that the purpose of IQ is to " measure the degree of middle-class cultural assimilation " ( p. 213 ) . <p> Cognitive styles are generally described using the terms field-independence and field-dependence . Research on these constructs was initiated by the perceptual research of Witkin and his associates in the 1950s and 1960s ( Castaneda &; Gray , 1974 ; Witkin &; Goodenough , 1981 ) . Castaneda and Gray ( 1974 ) have proposed that the term field-sensitive be substituted for field-dependence in order to counteract possible negative connotations . The field-sensitive mode is characterized by the inability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while field-dependence is characterized by an ability to perceive items as separate from the background ( Bennett , 1986 ; Castaneda &; Gray , 1974 ) . Several studies have pointed to field-sensitive tendencies in African American students and field-independent tendencies in children of the majority culture ( Bennett , 1986 ; Cataneda &; Gray , 1974 ; Shade , 1982 ) . <p> Field-sensitive students tend to be global in their views , excel at verbal tasks , react better to academic material that is relational , and perform in accordance with an authority figure 's indications of confidence or doubt in their abilities ( Anderson , 1988 ; Castaneda and Gray , 1974 ; Hernandez , 1989 ) . Field-independent students tend to view parts of a whole , excel in analytic tasks , are more receptive to material that is inanimate and impersonal , and tend to be self-directed ( Anderson , 1988 ; Castaneda &; Gray , 1974 ) . No relationship has been found between the field sensitivity-independent constructs and intelligence ( Banks , 1988 ; Bennett , 1986 ; Cohen , 1969 ) . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become more reflective as they grow older , which appears to have a positive impact on school-age children for such tasks as improved reading performance . <p> Cohen ( 1969 ) asserts that schools are extremely analytic ( field-independent ) , and that those students who are analytic in their approach to information processing have an advantage over students who tend to be relational ( field-sensitive ) in their approach to learning . Though these cognitive constructs do not imply a hierarchical relationship , the field-independent style appears to be more influential in the United States ( Anderson , 1988 ) . <p> Conflicts often arise when the African American student is required to perform in a manner or in an arena that is not facilitative to his or her style of learning . The tendency for schools to ignore the field-sensitive cognitive style sometimes engenders the negative mislabeling of the African American student as incompetent , lazy , or unwilling to learn . This may be exemplified by the faulty use of standardized testing and assessment , which may not accurately depict the abilities of African American children . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Discrepancies such as these culminate in the of times erroneous underestimation of African American student capabilities by teachers . <p> In essence , the educational institution tends to blame the child in these situations , rather than focusing on the " knowledge , skills , and abilities that the children possess " and building upon these strengths ( Means &; Knapp , 1991 , p. 286 ) . Translated into the classroom , the African American student may find his or her views in direct conflict with those of the school ( Anderson , 1988 ; Bennett , 1990 ; Cohen , 1976 ; Shade , 1982 ) . The Western world view , to which the American school system subscribes , emphasizes individualism , control , rigidity , limited affective expression , dichotomous thinking , task orientation , and is superiority driven ( Anderson , 1988 ; Hilliard , 1976 ; Sue &; Sue , 1990 ) . Implications for the Multicultural Classroom <p> It has been predicted that by the year 2000 , one of every three students in the U.S. public schools will be a member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1991 ) . The majority of these students will be African Americans and Hispanics from urban settings ( Cotton , 1992 ) . The American educational system must accept its responsibility for recognizing and respecting the strategic learning needs of the increasingly diverse student population ( Anderson , 1988 ; Castaneda &; Gray , 1974 ; Hernandez , 1989 ; Madhere , 1989 ) . In efforts to meet this goal , it is imperative that educational institutions examine their own internal structures . In preparing teachers to meet the needs of an increasingly diverse population , teacher-training programs and local system in services should include information on different cultures , learning styles , and how to teach using methods that recognize multicultural learners ( Willis , 1993 ) . Knowledge about Cultures <p> Teachers should be provided with information on and encouraged to explore cultures different from their own . Of course , it is impossible to know everything about every culture ; however , the importance of seeking basic cultural information can be fostered in teacher-training programs and through inservice training . <p> In addition to being knowledgeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beliefs and biases concerning those who are different from themselves . These biases can affect the interactions between the teacher and students . Knowledge about Learning Styles <p> As teachers consider the available information on learning styles they must consider several factors . First , they must he cognizant of their own learning styles . Teachers ' personal learning styles are likely to influence their styles of teaching ( Hernandez , 1989 ) . Second , teachers must keep in mind that learning style information simply provides alternative insights about the student whose culture is different . No cultural group should be perceived as adhering strictly to the field-independent and field-sensitive concepts . The individual differences of the students must also be taken into account . <p> Anderson ( 1988 ) states that a problem of great concern is teachers who " are not equipped to identify , interpret , and respond to the variant styles of multicultural populations " ( p. 7 ) . A teacher 's inability to work with persons demonstrating varied learning styles may create barriers to learning in the classroom . Sandefeur ( 1987 ) cites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new materials and learning strategies , including teachers wanting to contain their specific approach , teachers not wanting to demystify the theory and applications of the field , and the preference of some teachers to remain static in their teaching styles due to apathy or fear . These barriers prevent more balanced learning opportunities for students regardless of their backgrounds . <p> African American students must be helped to cope with a bicognitive learning system . It is the teacher 's responsibility as well to assist ethnic minority students in their endeavors to become effective learners . Hernandez ( 1989 ) states that learning strategies may be procured and refined as students move from elementary to secondary grades . Current research hypothesizes that some learning strategies are able to be explained or taught to students at specific maturity levels ( Hernandez , 1989 ) . Multicultural Teaching Methods <p> Bennett ( 1990 ) details instructional concepts and strategies known to be effective in working with the cultural and individual differences students bring to the classroom . Among these strategies are : learning centers , independent study , cooperative learning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies follows . <p> Learning centers provide variety in the classroom and also help teachers to individualize instruction ( Salend , 1994 ) . Gearherat ( Cited in Salend , 1994 ) identifies four types of learning centers : skill centers , discovery/enrichment centers , listening centers , and creativity centers . Skill centers are designed to allow students to practice skills learned ( spelling words , math facts , defining words ) . Discovery/enrichment centers utilize numerous learning activities that require students to add to their knowledge base ( science experiments , math applications ) . Listening centers are designed to provide students with instruction or recreation through listening . Finally , creativity centers have as their focus arts and crafts , music , creative writing , and poetry . <p> Independent study is another strategy that recognizes the learning styles of African American students . It goes further than just allowing students to work alone on assignments ( Bennett , 1990 ) . It refers to that portion of the teacher 's instructional program which permits students to choose their own learning objectives and the methods and materials of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study to identify an individual student 's interest and abilities through interviews , inventories , and tests . Students should have available to them materials and experiences that correspond with their interests and abilities . Teachers should be familiar with the amount of structure each student needs . Contracts and progress reports tailored to students ' needs encourage self-evaluation . Independent study should not be the only strategy used . The individual learning styles of students can also be recognized through the use of cooperative learning . <p> Ragan ( 1993 ) describes cooperative learning as instructional strategies that encourage cooperative student-student interaction over lesson content . Unlike traditional instruction where teachers structure learning so that students work individually or competitively , cooperative learning rewards students for ensuring that other members of the group have learned ( Johnson &; Johnson , 1986 ; Salend , 1994 ; Slavin , 1990 ) . Lessons are structured so that each group member has an opportunity to contribute to accomplishing the goals of the group and lesson . There are a variety of cooperative learning formats , all of which encourage students to depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used formats are briefly described by Goor and Schwenn ( 1993 ) and include : student teams-achievement divisions ( STAD ) , thinking-pair-share , jigsaw , team accelerated instruction ( TAI ) , and group investigation . STAD requires a small group of students to complete a common worksheet . Students then take individual tests . The score of the team is the result of individual students ' improvement over past performance . With think-pair-share , students answer questions for themselves , then discuss their thoughts with partners . Finally they share their combined efforts with the teacher , class , or small group . When using jigsaw , individual students are given information that they are responsible for teaching to others in their group . Students are then tested individually . Group and cooperative instruction are combined with TAI . Students are given materials at their level and assisted by peers . Points for the group are obtained through high achievement or improvement on individual tests . Group investigation allows students to decide what they want to learn , what individual group members will contribute , and how they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age-tutoring also employs student-student interaction . Peer tutoring utilizes same-age students teaching one another . The term cross-age tutoring refers to older students helping younger students . Research suggests that tutoring increases the academic skills of both tutees and tutors ( Heron &; Harris , 1993 ) . Among the benefits of peer tutoring are fostering positive attitudes toward school and learning , providing a greater sense of responsibility , and improving self-concepts ( Salend , 1994 ) . Students should be given the opportunity to be a tutor and to tutee . Conclusion <p> Aiding African Americans to more effectively function in the school setting is not the sole task of teachers , as they are but one part of the educational gestalt . Ultimately , change involves the active restructuring of entire school systems including educational organization , training programs , curriculum , and methods ( Cohen , 1969 ) . Hopefully , the inclusion of diverse teaching approaches and learning styles will encourage and support ethnic minority participation in the classroom . <p>                @ @ @ @ @
