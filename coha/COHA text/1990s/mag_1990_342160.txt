Q. You have said we must end our dependence on Middle East oil . Given our huge reliance on the Arab countries , is it possible ever to become entirely free of them ? <P> A. There are plenty of reserves to be found in our own hemisphere . We must work more closely with Canada , Mexico and the Central and South American countries so that we do n't have to worry about Middle East political volatilities and the problems of transportation over long distances . <P> Q. Where else are the big untapped fields ? <P> A. The Arctic offers giant possibilities . So does the entire Pacific Rim  --  Indonesia , Australia , China , even Vietnam . And there 's Eastern Europe , the North Sea , Africa . There 's as much oil , and more gas , to be discovered worldwide as we 've found throughout history . <P> Q. Is Russia a viable source ? <P> A. No question , but their oil potential is vastly undeveloped , and much of their production is failing . With our technical help and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q. What will it take to bring all the foreign oil home ? <P> A. We must build a relationship with the producing countries that will encourage them to ask the majors to come in and drill . Look at Vietnam . It 's a hot area . Other multinationals are in there , but American companies ca n't do business there yet . In exchange for permission to drill , we can offer our expertise to a lot of undeveloped countries in extracting their big mineral reserves . <P> Q. Will this alone be inducement for our big oil companies ? <P> A. It will if the Administration comes up with a firm energy policy that supports such exploration . I 've told President Bush and anyone who would listen that we must create a hemispheric energy policy . I thought he liked the idea . But nothing has been done . <P> Q. How much of our needs can new foreign supplies provide ? <P> A. They can provide two-thirds . The rest must come from the U.S. itself . <P> Q. But our reserves are shrinking . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near doubling in oil prices since the Iraqi invasion has done little to get it going . <P> A. It 's going to take some real stability in the price . If the price steadies out at $25 to $28 per bbl. and stays there six months , then at least wildcatters and investors wo n't be scared off . <P> Q. But have n't many of our bigger fields been drilled nearly dry ? <P> A. There is still as much oil to be found in the U.S. as has ever been produced . And some of our largest fields were drilled under terrible economic conditions . But as long as we have environmental moratoriums up and down the coasts , in Alaska and in the West , we certainly wo n't find them . <P> Q. What more will it take to bring the industry back ? <P> A. We need to have the tax incentives to drill . The backbone of our domestic industry has always been the independents . They 've found 80% of the nation 's oil and gas . But we once had 62,000 small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 . The government has thrust one disincentive after another at the industry . <P> Q. In what areas are the tax breaks most needed ? <P> A. For the operators of thousands of small marginal " stripper " wells . Collectively they produce about 1.2 million bbl. per day . Many of these old wells have been shut down or need to be reworked .
