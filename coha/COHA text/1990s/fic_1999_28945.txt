FRIDAY afternoon , Edelman 's Bakery in Washington Heights is like the stock exchange -- paper numbers strewn across the floor , everybody shouting orders : " Give me two ! Seedless ! No , make that four . " " A dozen onion ! " " What ? " " A dozen onion rolls -- and I 'm in a rush . " " Six challahs ! " Isaac calls out . Suit jacket slung over his shoulder , he leans against the glass counter where Mrs. Edelman presides at the cash register . Isaac 's white shirt is drenched with sweat , his tie folded in the pocket . The air conditioner is feeble , and the bakery is mobbed with sweating customers : the women , in their long skirts and long sleeves , all covered up , even in the heat . The men , just off from work , their faces flushed under their black hats . The bakery floor , and even the walls , are scuffed and dirty , the glass cases empty except for a few babkas on curled wax paper . Edelman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plucked from wire bins , Isaac 's challahs are so fresh that Mrs. Edelman 's fingers dent them . The loaves are magnificent , over a foot long , artfully braided , glossy with painted egg white , but time is short . Mrs. Edelman dumps them unceremoniously into brown paper bags . Isaac snatches them up with his change and runs out to his station wagon . He drops the bread and his suit jacket into the scorching-hot backseat and starts the car . He does not take off his bat ; Isaac wears a black felt fedora , even in the summer . He is a small man , slightly built . His eyes are not dark , but light brown , and luminous like amber . His hair is brown , too , and like all the men in Washington Heights ' Kirshner community , he is clean shaven , almost modern looking , with neither beard nor peyyes . Isaac rolls up his shirtsleeves , and the veins stand out on his bare forearms . The steering wheel burns his fingers , but he has a wiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic , Isaac passes shop windows armored with metal grilles , cement walls spray-painted pink . He drives past Auerbach 's butcher shop , Schwartz 's kosher cheese , Grimaldi 's corner store , and the Kirshner synagogue with its barred windows and combination locks . In 1976 the neighborhood is small and shabby and tight . The Kirshners ' apartment buildings are built close together of red brick , their few stores clustered as if for safety . Flights of stairs , hundreds of cement steps , provide shortcuts from the streets above to those below , and always , on the cement stairs , mothers and their babies , grandparents and teenagers , are passing each other . Everyone takes these stairs to get up and down , as if the neighborhood were a single house . There are no stairs , however , to the top of the Heights . No Kirshners climb up to Fort Tryon Park or go to the museum there , the Cloisters , with its icons and crucifixes , its medieval sculpture carved in cool gray stone . The Kirshners never think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . Although they have no paintings , or stained glass , or sculpture , they array themselves with gorgeous words . PULLING into the upper Port Authority , Isaac sits with the engine running and scans the crowds for his car pooler , Andras Melish . Loudspeakers in the bus terminal blare destinations in New York State : Syracuse , Albany , Schenectady . Isaac is surprised not to see Andras standing there , waiting . He does not think he could be overlooking him . Andras is not easily overlooked . He always stands out , much taller than the others in the waiting crowd . A shadow darkens the passenger side window . Andras climbs into the car and slams the door behind him . " Where were you ? I was trying to phone you , " Andras says . Despite his fifty-seven years he has the challenging voice and arrogant black eyes of his youth . " I got held up at the bakery . " Isaac is polite but unapologetic . They had hoped to beat the rush-hour traffic , but at two o'clock they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Mercury does not have air conditioning . Stuck in traffic , the car gets so hot , it hurts to breathe . As if to taunt them , the Hudson below glistens in the sun . Through the bars and cables of the bridge Isaac watches sailboats puff up with the river breeze . " Why do n't you try the other lane ? " Andras asks . He is a stickler for punctuality . Habitually , as if to hold it against Isaac , he times their commute . " This lane is fine , " Isaac replies . There is still a distance between them left over from the winter . In the city the men almost never see each other ; they lead such different lives . Isaac 's gritty neighborhood is nothing like Andras 's on the Upper West Side . Isaac 's clerical job in the Department of Public Works is far from Andras 's position as head of his own import company . And , of course , Isaac 's upbringing and convictions are nothing like Andras 's . Young and fervent in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Heights . But Andras is twenty , years older , an immigrant from Budapest . He comes from an expansive , assimilated Jewish community that , like Andras 's belief in God , has scarcely existed since the war . By the time the gray Thruway spreads out before them , and the station wagon picks up speed , Isaac is exhausted . His legs ache . He wishes away the two hours ahead . His wife will be waiting for him . He has n't seen Elizabeth all week . She will come out to the car and help him carry in the armfuls of fresh bread . The girls will be playing in the yard . Soccer , hopscotch , tetherball , jump rope . They will jump up to see him . Through the open window , in the dry breeze , Andras watches trucks heaving past -- eighteen-wheelers with smokestacks of their own . He 's brought in a new line of toy trucks at the warehouse . Tonka trucks , blue and white , logger trucks loaded with miniature pine logs , orange U-Hauls with detachable six-inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bumper stickers for the Bicentennial . What Andras really needs is a second car . His wife wo n't hear of it , of course . It would be a waste of gas , she says . Nina 's conserving energy for the whole country , carpooling . Often Andras thinks that he would n't mind spending a few weekends alone in the city . He could use the time to do his books . But his sisters , Eva and Maja , are waiting for him in their brick house in Kaaterskill . Even now , as he and Isaac are driving up , Andras 's older sisters are baking rugelach , prune cake , and mandelbrot . They still bake for him , just as they did when he was a boy . " Our exit , " Andras says suddenly . Isaac turns off , at the last minute , onto 23A . " You did n't see it , did you ? " Audras asks . Isaac smiles , a lightning-quick smile . " I was waiting for you to remind me . " He can tease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making better time . They are closer to Kaaterskill . Everything is easier . Even as they take the exit , the wind softens . The Thruway is now four lanes instead of eight . Billboards for Catskill Game Farm appear , ads for the petting zoo with pictures of goats and lambs blown up giant-size against the trees . The hills on either side are green , thick with oak and pine . Nothing but trees on either side , and the broad road slowly rising . The wind seems to comb the trees upright so that they stand thick and straight . Turning onto Washington Irving Highway , they enter the forest . They exchange the sunny afternoon for shade , and the light breeze for damper , stiller air . The highway cuts around Cole Mountain , peeling away in a slow spiral from the trees . As the road rises , the lanes narrow , pressed together by the heavy woods . Transmission humming , the car climbs past shattered boulders , enormous shards of rock . Old oaks overhang the road , roots flung up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light in thin stalks , like grass . And yet there are houses here behind the trees . One on the right with peeling white paint , another freshly painted turquoise with a baby barn , and an enormous mailbox . This is Palenville . The mountain villages announce themselves with motels and signs : WELCOME TO PHOENICIA , and ENTERING COOKSBURG . Sudden flashes of sun , Floyd 's Motel and Cooksburg 's main street radiate light as clearings in the shade . Isaac 's car hugs the tightly coiled road . The low safety rail bolted to the road 's edge is n't much to keep a car from tumbling down into the deep gorges , hundreds of feet below . Isaac drives above the gorge called Devil 's Kitchen , and the ravine called Devil 's Dam . There are car wrecks rusting down there under the leaves , and boulders bigger than the wrecked cars . And there is the sound of water , the rustling water , to Isaac 's ears , like a thousand men praying together , davening and turning pages . Little by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voices growing louder and louder , until , as the road turns toward Kaaterskill Falls , the water begins to roar . The road is high , clinging to the mountain . The rapids rush white over the green rocks , then tumble down into pools far below . From the car Isaac and Andras ca n't see the swimmers playing and diving in the rock pools . Only the falls pouring down over the upper face of the rock , a blasting of all the long spring 's rains and winter 's melted snow . It 's darker and greener here than anywhere else . The gorges and ravines broaden into a deep valley , and across the valley , far away in the trees , are Victorian mansions , tiny in the distance . Fairyland , Isaac 's girls call the hillside , and the faraway houses do look like fairy palaces , delicate as chess pieces , exquisitely carved rooks . Past Fairyland , past Kendall Falls and Bear Mountain , Isaac drives . Past the roadside spring bubbling into its mossy barrel , past granite boulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and old in congregation , until , at last , he enters the town of Kaaterskill , bright with white houses set against dark trees . Kaaterskill 's Main Street is five blocks long . The buildings are all clapboard with porches , except for the brick firehouse , just built to replace the old station that burned down a year ago . Rubin 's Hotel is the biggest building on Main Street . The line of rocking chairs on the hotel porch is positioned for a view of the whole town . Across the way the post office also has a porch , and is freshly painted Williamsburg-blue with cream trim . Then there is the Taylor Building , where the Taylor brothers practice law , and trade in real estate ; Hamilton 's shingled general store ; King Real Estate ; Boyd 's Garage , with its dusty , glassed-in office at the back ; the Orpheum , showing The Godfather Part II . The Main Street buildings nestle together companionably , as they have for years . They match each other , with their shutters and twelve-paned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the street does the old style give way to the new . Here , like the village dragon , the chrome-and-glass A &; P sprawls in its black-paved parking lot . Isaac turns off Main Street just before the A &; P , and drives down Maple Street , gently sloping , broad , and gracious . The trees on Maple are gigantic , so old , they arc over the road in a canopy of leaves . Their shade extends to every house , from the big summer places like Andras 's with sweeping lawns in back , to the rental bungalows like Isaac 's , small and square . Under the trees Isaac parks the car , and he and Andras step out . The city is gone and the world is green . Green trees , and green grass , and green leaves all around . As he does every Friday , Andras goes directly to see his sisters , but Isaac walks across the street . A crowd is gathering at the Curtis place . Will Curtis 's new house has finally arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounted on an enormous flatbed truck . A white-sided rectangular shoe box of a house with a green front door and matching ornamental green shutters . " Daddy ! " Three-year-old Brocha runs toward Isaac . " Up ! " He hoists up his youngest daughter onto his shoulders and they watch as the huge truck backs into the Curtis lot with half the house clamped on its back . Isaac 's wife , Elizabeth , makes her way to him through the crowd . She does n't kiss him . Not in front of all these people . But Isaac stands so close to her that her skirt brushes against him . Elizabeth is wearing a long twill skirt and a pinstriped man-tailored shirt buttoned all the way up . In summer she is so covered up in her long sleeves , long skirts , and white stockings that only the backs of her hands are freckled , and her face . She wears small gold-rimmed glasses . Her cheek is curved in a smile , her hazel eyes green in the shade . " Is n't it marvelous ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her accent English . " Look , even the carpet is down in the rooms already ! " She watches the men maneuver the second half of the house into place . " Well , it 's just a prefab , Elizabeth , " says Isaac , amused . " Oh , I know that , " she says , eyes on the closing seam between the two halves . " But it 's marvelous . It 's like a doll 's house . " Nearly the whole town has come to watch . The year-rounders and the summer people , who are mostly from the city , Kirshners from Washington Heights , families from Borough Park , Lubavichers from Crown Heights . They all stand together , chattering excitedly , watching the delivery of the new house . The old place is gone , burned to the ground , and now the insurance money 's come in . Everyone 's busy pointing and shouting out directions to the movers and the trucks . " A little more , a little more , " urges one of the teenagers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screams a Talmud scholar , up for a week 's vacation . The trucks pull the two halves of the house in close , but there is still a gap between the walls . The crowd stirs , frustrated , surging forward to give advice -- fair-haired children along with young men in black hats . " Nu ? What gives ? " demands a silver-bearded man in a frock coat . And just then the seam vanishes and the house is finished . The whole town and the summer people break into applause . " More . More , " protests Brocha from Isaac 's shoulders . " It 's all done , " he tells her . " It 's time to go home . " " Again ! " she says , pointing to the house , but Elizabeth is already crossing the street , and Isaac follows with Brocha swaying on his shoulders . He puts her down on the porch . " Go on , " Elizabeth tells him . " Go on inside . " And she calls the children to help her unload the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She looks over to the tire swing , where their oldest daughter stands , storklike , watching the trucks pull out across the street . " Chani , could you bring your sisters back ? They 're still out with Pammy Curtis . " Elizabeth 's English accent has n't rubbed off on her daughters , but they all have English names . No one ever uses them . To their friends they 're just the Shulman girls , five rattled off in a row : Chani , Malki , Ruchel , Sorah , and Brocha . But Elizabeth gave them other names , and she repeats them to herself : Annette and Margot , Rowena , Sabrina , and Bernice . These are her daughters ' real names ; the ones on their birth certificates ; extraordinary and graceful -- princesses and dancers . It 's true , of course , the nickname Malki by itself means " queen , " and Sorah means a " princess . " But those are words the children drag around the house . There must be twenty Sorahs at the Kirshner school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She did n't name her daughters to be rattled off . She named them to have imagination . As a girl in Manchester , Elizabeth played tennis . When she was sixteen , she even got a job teaching it to younger children at her school . But the interschool matches in the district were all on Saturdays , and she could n't play on Shabbes . Hers was a small school built by the Kehilla of observant families . Her father taught Talmud in the upper division . Elizabeth had prepared to teach Hebrew herself , and took her certificate at Carmel College in Henley before she married . Then she settled down to raising children . None of this was unexpected . Meeting Isaac in New York was not arranged , but it was natural . Elizabeth was twenty , and her parents said she ought to move about and see things . Not exactly travel , but visit the family , her aunt 's family in New York . And there was Shayni 's wedding that summer anyway . Elizabeth would be their emissary . She is unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington Heights . She reads Milton on her own . She 's spent her pregnancies with Austen and Tolstoy . With Brocha she was the most ambitious and tried to read all of Sandburg 's biography of Lincoln . She should get back to that one , she thinks , as she sets the table for their late dinner . They do n't have a separate dining room , of course . It 's a small bungalow . Just three bedrooms . The gifts ' rooms are so narrow , there is barely any space between their beds . They do n't mind , though , because they spend their time outside . The living room is shadowy , with only one dim ceiling fixture and two windows . Elizabeth keeps the front door open to let in more light . In the evening the trees rustle together . Not a single car passes by . Elizabeth prays , standing in the living room , with her tiny siddur , its pages thin as flaky pastry . She recites the Friday-night service to herself , rapidly , under her breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she holds herself straight . In the way she holds herself , in the way she moves , she has a kind of athletic grace . She is slender , although she has five children . She grew up early , marrying young , having her first child at twenty-one . Still , at thirty-four , she is excitable , eager to speak , and quick to laugh . She is , more than anything , curious , delighted by paradoxes , odd characters , anything out of the ordinary . She looks forward every year to Kaaterskill and the people there : Andras Melish and his South American wife ; Professor Cecil Birnbaum ; the Curtises with their tomboy daughter , Pammy ; the Landauer family , Lubavichers from Crown Heights . In the summers she can sec these friends again , and they are both exotic and familiar , like distant relatives . Both Brocha and Sorah are asleep by the time Isaac comes home from services , and so Elizabeth and Isaac sit down for blintzes with the older girls . Twelve-year-old Chani looks most like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has Elizabeth 's black hair , though a stranger would n't know . All Elizabeth 's sheitels are auburn . She 'd always loved auburn hair , and so when she married and had to cut hers short she decided she might as well become auburn haired . She bought auburn wigs in different styles : pageboy , straight , short , and wavy . Most often in Kaaterskill she wears a kerchief over her hair , but she brings the sheitels up , and keeps them on the top shelf of her closet on faceless white Styrofoam heads . Next to Chani at the table , Malki eats her blintzes without sour cream or jam . Ever since she could talk it was always " plain , plain " for her food . No jam on blintzes , no gravy on her meat , no mustard on her salami sandwiches . She 's a solemn gift : light brown hair , brown eyes , a little wall-eyed even . A quiet child , not a biker like Chani or a tree climber like chattering nine-year-old Ruchel . Ruchel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes home covered with mud . She and Sorah and Para Curtis with her red wagon seem to be dredging Bramble Creek behind the Birnbaum place . " Daddy , " Ruchel says now , " you know down there at the creek ? " " Yes . " " The blackberries down there are the biggest ones I 've ever seen in my life . But Mr. King came out with his dog . " Elizabeth laughs . " You mean his poodle ? " Ruchel keeps talking . " He said we were trespassing on his property and we had to get off . But he does n't own the creek , and I was standing in the creek . " " But the bushes belong to him , " Elizabeth points out . " You should n't pick from his bushes . " " He 's a Norka , " Ruchel says oddly . She 's been reading the Red Fairy Tale Book . " He 's a real estate developer , " Isaac says . " Do you know what else he owns ? He owns this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe you . " " When we went up to the lake I squashed the tire on my bike , " says Chani . " Sh . We 'll talk about it later , " Isaac tells her . Drowsily he leans back in his chair . Across from him Malki cuts her blintz and Ruchel chatters about bicycle pumps . " Cecil Birnbaum brought his wife up , " Elizabeth tells Isaac . Cecil is the Brooklyn College professor who summers across the street . " And do you remember Regina from Los Angeles ? " " Cecil 's sister . " " She came up for the week . She 's having a wedding reception for Cecil and Beatrix tomorrow . His wife 's name is Beatrix . " " Cecil and Beatrix Birnbaum , " Isaac says , trying out the names . " Yes . I said we 'd come . " " We 'll see , " says Isaac . He can barely keep his eyes open . Isaac goes to bed right after dinner , and Elizabeth tucks in the children and washes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little silver travel candlesticks . Elizabeth wipes the crumbs off the counter and then walks out onto the front porch stacked with bicycles . The house , small and close , is filled with the rhythmic breathing of Isaac and the children , but the air outside is cold , and it wakes her . She peers through the thick maple leaves , trying to glimpse the stars . What are they dreaming about inside ? Blackberries and poodles , speckled newts , " The Twelve Dancing Princesses " in Ruchel 's Red Fairy Tale Book . Are her daughters now tiptoeing down the secret staircase to the enchanted lake ? Perhaps now they are dreaming of the silver wood with the trees spangled in silver , and the golden wood where the trees are spangled with gold , and at last the diamond wood where the trees are hung with drops of diamonds . They are wearing out their shoes dancing . Elizabeth had loved that story when she was a child , and the idea that there are secret forests where you can become someone else .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
