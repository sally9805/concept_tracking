When the Main-Danube Canal opens in 1992 , trade and tourists will begin to travel by boat from the North Sea to the Black Sea <p> It was the day after Christmas 1989 , and it was just about the first time in anyone 's memory that the Friendship Bridge had really lived up to its name . Nearly a mile and a half of cantilevered blue-gray iron , the second-longest bridge in Europe , it stretches from Ruse to Giurgiu , and if those names do n't happen to ring any bells for you , try this : Friendship Bridge is the main connection between Bulgaria and Romania , and the river it spans is the Danube . <p> Friendly , indeed , it was that Boxing Day , because the news was just out that President Nicolae Ceausescu ( who called himself the " Genius of the Carpathians , " the " Danube of Thought " ) had been executed . As a consequence , the first phase of the Romanian Revolution had well and truly carried the day . At the exact midpoint of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kalashnikovs and double-strapped Romanian helmets smiled and made the V-for-Victory sign as our car approached , then positively beamed with pleasure when they were offered a pack of American cigarettes , still a reliable currency for everyday transactions in Romania . <p> With me in the little rented car from Sofia was Iskra , a representative of the Bulgarian oppositionist organization Eco-Glasnost , an outfit whose idealistic name alone suffices to outline its politico-ecological goals ( " Purity everywhere , in everything , " she had announced earlier , " and equality in all parties " ) . And as we drove from checkpoint to checkpoint toward Bucharest she hardly ever dropped her own right hand for the " V " that she was perpetually flashing in the direction of any Romanians she could espy . And they all flashed it back , too . The camaraderie was quite overwhelming . <p> Also quite uncharacteristic . A Slavic culture on one side ( Bulgaria ) , a Latin-derived one on the other ( Romania ) , the two nations have spent a good deal of their time mutually ignoring each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other 's . There have been occasional punch-ups , too , as in the Second Balkan War and World War I , but in this moment of revolutionary euphoria all that was forgotten . Now Iskra the Bulgarian had hitched a ride with me to carry to the Romanians on the other side of the river clothing and medicines she had scrounged around Ruse , on the basis of the only factor likely to create amity , however brief , between two disparate Balkan peoples : a shared loathing of Communism . <p> The fact that we had just crossed the Danube on this mission was nicely symbolic , because if ever a river represented the rivalries , contradictions , complications and diversity of the Middle European experience , it is this one . Partly for that reason , if ever a river had a chance to help the New Europe work , commercially and culturally , it is the historic Danube . <p> Something like 1,770 miles in length , it flows through and serves no fewer than eight sovereign nations ( West Germany , Austria , Hungary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union ) . Not to mention a mind-blowing collection of present and past ethnic groups and civilizations , some of which once formed states themselves and  --  who knows  --  could do so again in the future . You remember all about the Ottoman empire , of course , and probably Bosnia and Herzegovina , too , but what about Serbia and Slovakia and Montenegro and Macedonia and Dalmatia and Croatia and Transylvania and Moldavia and Dacia ? It was no accident that the Balkans became a universal byword for labyrinthine human complications . <p> The Mississippi is about 600 miles longer than the Danube , but you can order exactly the same double burger in exactly the same language from one end to the other . On the Danube , the languages change no fewer than seven times , and its very name changes six times , beginning with " Donau " in West Germany 's Black Forest and ending with " Dunay " in the Soviet Union at the Black Sea . <p> By way of nourishment , the Danubian equivalent of the double burger might begin near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( about half a pig lying atop a steaming heap of sauerkraut ) , move on to pastries , chocolate and Schlag in Vienna , blood-red paprika stews in Hungary , lamb with yogurt in Bulgaria , quasi-French dishes in Romania , and finally vodka and shashlik by the corner of the delta that lies within the Soviet Union . The architecture along the way will mutate from Gothic cathedrals to little onion-domed churches to Turkish minarets to Socialist-modern horrors built scarcely 20 years ago and already candidates for demolition . <p> As Europe 's one great west-to-east river , the Danube was the primitive highway to the Orient . Christian crusaders cruised down it toward the Holy Land to fight Muslims . Muslim zealots or just plain marauders moved east to west into Europe from the Black Sea and Turkey , the steppes of Central Asia , or even all the way from Mongolia . <p> Pre-Christian Greeks plied that highway , too , as did the later Byzantines , Goths , Huns , Avars and other similarly bellicose tourists . The Romans chose the Danube as their limes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studded the banks with fortifications and stout stone watchtowers , many of which survive in more or less vestigial form today , while patrolling its channels with their earlier versions of the U.S. Marine gunboats that prowled the Mekong . <p> From Attila 's time in the fifth century , through the Slavic expansion into the Balkans , the great push of the Ottoman empire , the rise and fall of the Hapsburg empire , the Germanic emigrations , the Napoleonic imperialism , the revolutionary struggles of the mid-19th century , right up to the two world wars and Stalin 's imposition of Communism on Eastern Europe , the Danube has been both the site and the instrument ( transporter of troops and materiel ) of so many battles that a map of its route reads like a military atlas . <p> It is ironic that a river with such a reputation starts so peacefully and prettily . Europeans being Europeans , there are three different versions of its true source , but all of them lie within the Hansel-and-Gretel decor of Germany 's Schwarzwald , or Black Forest , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trucks in Missouri , even if the gingerbread houses are rare . <p> Taking up this problem in his recent book " Danube , " Italian author and literary historian Claudio Magris first checked out the official " source " on the grounds of the ancestral Furstenberg castle at Donaueschingen , with its no-nonsense sign : Hier entspringt die Donau ( The Donau starts here ) . In fact , Donaueschingen 's most plausible claim to the genesis of the great river lies in the fact that two little rivers , the Breg and the Brigach , come together there , then flow away in merged form as the uncontested Danube . But what about the sources of the Breg and Brigach ? That 's where matters become European again . The Brigach is a pretty stream and has local advocates . But the Breg is the longer of the two , farther from the Black Sea and hence , its supporters say , the true source of the Danube . <p> The little Breg begins its life near the town of Furtwangen . It was there that Magris set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gutter of an 18th-century house . It was purportedly fed by a basin in its kitchen that was in turn filled to perpetual overflowing by a tap that no one had ever been able to turn off . Following the stream uphill toward its mountain meadow birthplace , Magris found the " gutter . " It turned out to be a hollowed-out log used to direct water from a lead pipe fed by the same spring as the pool on the hillside below that feeds the Breg . A dead end , but like so much of the lore that has grown up about the river , the bizarre intricacies involved made a story too good not to be used . Conveniently transplanted to Transylvania <p> Consider the case of Vlad Tepes ( 1431 ? - 1476 ) , prince of the Danubian principality of Walachia , who became known as Vlad the Impaler for his habit of forcing his enemies to sit on sharpened stakes . The son of Prince Vlad Dracul ( Vlad the Devil ) , Vlad Tepes was also known as Dracula , or Son of the Devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vampire of his 1897 best-selling novel , conveniently transplanting him to the Danubian province of Transylvania . <p> Chilling fantasy , of course . But recent research in Canada has suggested that in the Middle Ages large numbers of people may have suffered from a chronic blood disease . Its symptoms were emaciation , drumtight lips and gums , protuberant teeth , and a sensitivity to the sun so severe that it caused sufferers to sleep by day and go a-wandering by night  --  presumably in search of the fresh blood that seemed to give them some relief . <p> It was ambitious dictator Nicolae Ceausescu who six years ago inaugurated one of the four major engineering projects with which the Danube has been saddled in postwar times . All four of them represent concrete , modern responses to a dream of merchants and freebooters that dates at least from the time of the Vikings : unfettered trading across Europe from west to east via a single waterway . With the easing of the Cold War , the advent of the New Europe in 1992 and the soon-to-be-completed Main-Danube Canal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Sea , the Danube has the opportunity to fulfill that dream  --  becoming a steadily greater artery binding East and West together . <p> The Rhine , entered at the great Dutch port of Rotterdam , has long carried boats upstream to Mainz , where the river Main flows into it . Though the Rhine then continues almost due south toward Switzerland , the Main curls east by way of Frankfurt and Schweinfurt . From Bamberg on the Main to Regensburg , the Danube 's northernmost point , it is only 80 miles as the crow flies . <p> The first to try his hand at linking the two rivers was none other than Charlemagne . In 793 , he began work on his " Fossa Carolina , " a canal that was designed to join a tributary of the Danube to a tributary of the Main . The ditch had to be abandoned after only a little more than a mile was dug , but the idea remained as seductive as ever during succeeding centuries . In 1837 King Ludwig I of Bavaria , a patron of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers digging . Nine years later he had a full-blown canal , 106 miles long and nearly 5 feet deep , between the Main and the Danube . It was slow going  --  no fewer than 101 locks were needed to bring the horse-towed barges yard by yard over the high points  --  but the Ludwigskanal was state of the art for its time . <p> Unfortunately for Ludwig , a more modern form of state-of-the-art transportation  --  the railroad  --  was just then coming into strength . Although the Ludwigskanal was still used for shipping until the 1940s , it was unable to compete in speed with the train . Nevertheless , the idea of trading by water through the heart of Europe from the North Sea to the Black Sea persisted . So did the idea of making the Danube a river fully navigable by large vessels . <p> The river 's most intractable obstacle to heavy shipping was the Iron Gate , a terrifying caldron at the edge of the Carpathian Mountains , where the river passed through the corset of Europe 's deepest gorge and narrowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Walachian and Danubian plains in a series of five spectacular cataracts . <p> In the 1890s , a 1.5-mile canal was built along the river 's right bank , allowing ships to bypass the Gate . In the early 1960s , Romania and Yugoslavia began work on a joint project to speed up traffic by further taming the watery monster . The dam and hydroelectric plant at Djerdap , called Iron Gate I , was finished in 1972 and later complemented by a second dam , lower down , known as Iron Gate II . Where waters once boiled , and boats had to be painfully winched up rapids , the Danube is now backed up into a long , placid lake , attainable by two deep locks . What has disappeared in the way of savage beauty has been gained in kilowatt-hours , and aquatic parking lots for diesel-powered barges . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would surely approve . <p> Ceausescu 's contribution to Danube navigation came later . It was the Danube-Black Sea Canal , a 40-mile cut through the Romanian lowlands from the river at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides boats with a shortcut to avoid the enormous Danube delta and the myriad meanders that precede it , thus saving some 150 miles of slow steaming . Completed in 1984 , it was dug largely by political prisoners and conscripts of the Romanian Army . <p> The canal constituted " the most representative of the great constructions of our country 's period of powerful expansion  --  ' the Ceausescu Epoch , ' " gushed a deluxe handout from that period , lavishly illustrated with pictures of the canal and a baby-faced Ceausescu . The great man followed up this triumph by ordering the army to dig a second canal between the Danube and his landlocked capital , Bucharest . The army thanked him by siding with the revolutionaries in December 1989 , and then executing the " Great Conductor " by firing squad . <p> Even more ambitious than Ceausescu 's pharaonic projects was the enormous Gabcikovo-Nagymaros river barrage system , a 124-mile-long complex that includes a 23-square-mile artificial lake , dams , hydro-electric plants and a diversion canal . The project was jointly planned and built by Czechoslovakia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 5Os , when the Stalinist school of gigantism was at its apogee ( lakes emptied , rivers reversed and such ) it gave not a moment 's thought to ecology , history or esthetics . The crown jewel of the plan was a colossal concrete bathtub some 15.5 miles long , snaking aboveground through the Slovakian countryside southeast of Bratislava . Up to 60 feet tall and 900-2,000 feet wide , the bathtub was to be nothing less than a new Danube , a diversion canal rerouting the river around the shallows lying approximately halfway between Budapest and Vienna . Never again , those early planners vowed , would heavy-laden coal and gravel barges be held up by sandbanks or summer low-water periods . <p> Trouble was , the giant project threatened to dry up one of Europe 's last great river wetlands , a unique ecosystem nourishing some 5,000 species of birds , mammals , fish , insects and reptiles . Heaven knows , Johann Strauss the Younger to the contrary , the Danube was never blue  --  it varies from yellowish to a translucent brown . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , replete with raw sewage from Bratislava and elsewhere , bid fair not to improve its complexion . More important , it was argued , the project would also threaten Europe 's greatest reserve of underground fresh water . just as certainly , rerouting the river would dry up the region 's most fertile farmland . And finally , if the lower dam at Nagymaros were put into operation , the whole Danube Bend area , home of the Arpad dynasty and some of Hungary 's most important archaeological sites , risked being flooded . <p> It was n't . <p> Faced with escalating construction costs and strong opposition from the democratic forces that eventually forced the Communists from power last March , the Hungarian Parliament voted in November 1989 to suspend work on the project , and canceled entirely the dam and electric plant at Nagymaros on the Danube Bend . The Czechoslovaks were furious  --  they had virtually finished their side of the project , and the bathtub was ready for filling  --  but without Hungary 's Nagymaros dam the full original plan could not be carried through . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered the project to be partially salvageable , while the Hungarians were busy with the more important business of building a new democracy . Environmentalists in Hungary want to turn the area into an internationally supervised park . Perhaps a compromise will be found , but until then the bathtub remains mournfully empty , and the ecologists breathe easier . <p> The most successful of the great earth-moving projects on the Danube is the Main-Danube Waterway , more commonly known in German as the Wasserstrasse , or " water street . " Begun during the 1920s , and now directed by a consortium led by the Federal Republic of Germany , the project covers a total distance of 420 miles and , in addition to its centerpiece , the Main-Danube Canal , includes the canalization of parts of the Main and Danube rivers , as well as the construction of several hydroelectric plants . Following the approximate line of the Ludwigskanal , the digging began on the Main-Danube Canal 30 years ago . Now all but the last miles of the 100-mile linkup are finished . A modern high-capacity waterway 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be able to accommodate " Europe ships " of up to 2,000 tons and two-unit pushbarges of up to 3,600 tons each . <p> Where the Ludwigskanal required 101 locks , this one needs only 16 , the deepest locks lifting ships 82 feet at a shot . So prudently were plans laid that a brief outcry of opposition from environmentalists-the Greens-died when the consortium demonstrated that , far from damaging the ecosystem and creating pollution , the canal would actually help clean some of Germany 's already polluted rivers by bringing in purer water from the Danube . <p> " We had a Ministry of Landscape Planning and Nature Protection ten years before the Greens even existed , " Florian Stumfall , the consortium spokesman , told me with suitably dismissive hauteur in his Munich office . " In the Riedenburg-Kelheim section alone , nature protection cost us some 75 million deutsche marks , or 15 percent of the total budget . The Greens are never happy . " <p> Regarding the most recently completed sections of the modern canal , at any rate , it is difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under clifftop castles and punctuated with numerous fish-rich lakes , it is indeed quite lovely , with waterside footpaths and bicycle tracks that should make it a tourist 's paradise . Far from being an eyesore , it looks for all the world like a venerable old river , thoughtfully provided with enough picturesque villages and country inns to support an entire picture-postcard industry . The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers would not approve . <p> Even so , the Greens were right to raise the alarm as a matter of principle . The 20th century has inflicted such a plethora of hydroelectric and flood-control projects on the Danube  --  most notably in Austria  --  that for miles on end it has all the charm of an industrial basin . Besides , concern for the Danube 's environment has also been a unifying force among the people of the disparate cultures that live along the river 's length . <p> By 1992 , when the Main-Danube construction people have tidied up , the canal will open for business and the ancient dream of the Vikings will have become reality : from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterway , ready for the shipping trade and tourism . One likes to imagine cheeses from Holland and Bulgarian tomatoes , lace from Brussels and paprika from Hungary zipping back and forth . But most of the trade wo n't be very romantic stuff : barges are slow , limited almost exclusively to petroleum products , construction materials and similarly awkward , heavy loads  --  gravel travel . <p> Where greater speed is required , the ancient saltwater route via the Bosporus , the Mediterranean , the Strait of Gibraltar and the Atlantic will still do the job twice as fast ( two weeks versus four ) . And of course trucks ( SMITHSONIAN , November 1986 ) and planes will still be unbeatable for perishables . Even so , the consortium 's directors have calculated that the Wasserstrasse 's considerably lower shipping costs should make it a profitable venture . <p> Considerably more exciting for travelers are the tourist prospects made possible by the canal . The German and Austrian companies that operate cruises on the Danube  --  as well as the Dutch and Swiss who work the Rhine  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novelty for their luxurious hotel ships . As commerce , tourism and democracy mutually nudge one another in the direction of the future , optimists unashamedly predict a new era of rapprochement between East and West . And with the crumbling of the Iron Curtain , the possibility of reduced tariffs , further improvements in navigability , and the changes needed for the countries of Eastern Europe to produce goods salable in Western markets , the continuing dream of the " beautifully flowing " Danube as a conduit of culture and commerce looks promising . <p> Disabused old Mitteleuropa hands still have doubts , though . French shipping companies are already grumbling about the menace from the East , with barges from what used to be known as the Soviet bloc countries creeping up the Main-Danube Canal like dollareating viruses to offer bargain freight prices within the previously protected waters of Western Europe . And barely six weeks after my euphoric crossing of the Friendship Bridge , sporadic violence began to break out against ethnic Hungarians in the Romanian province of Transylvania . <p> By Rudolph Chelminski <p> <p> Rudolph Chelminski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 years , wrote last for the SMITHSONIAN about France 's famous Guide Michelin . <p>
