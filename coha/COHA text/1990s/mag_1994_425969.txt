OMNI KICKS OFF PROJECT OPEN BOOKS , A WORLDWIDE QUEST FOR CLOSE ENCOUNTERS OF THE DOCUMENTED KIND <p> IT WAS A CLEAR , COLD NIGHT IN BROOKLYN , NEW YORK , WHEN HAM-RADIO OPERATOR ALEX CAVALLARI PICKED UP BIZARRE , JUMPING WAVE FORMS ON HIS SCOPE . AN HOUR LATER AND SOME TEN MILES WEST IN NEWARK , NEW JERSEY , THE SAME DISTURBANCE , PUZZLED FORMER NAVY MAN AND HAM-RADIO OPERATOR JOHN GONZALEZ . GONZALEZ 'S NEIGHBORS WERE DISRUPTED AS WELL : TV RECEPTION WAS INTERRUPTED , HOMES SHOOK AS IF IN AN EARTHQUAKE , AND SEVERAL WITNESSES REPORTED A FLASH OF LIGHT . GONZALES NOW CLAIMS HE COULD MAKE OUT A DISC-SHAPED CRAFT INSIDE the light , and contends the craft brushed his ham-radio antenna and knocked down tree branches in his backyard . A strange , ashlike sphere the size of a golf ball was later found in his yard . Rich in evidence , this intriguing incident has already been investigated by police and fire departments and by researchers in a lab . The needed culmination for all this data : a synthesis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and physical effects also define dramatic sightings over southwestern Michigan , where hundreds of people have reported red and , white lights moving in circles through the sky . Here , the documentation includes police reports confirming the strange phenomena as well as data from the National Weather Service at the Muskegon County Airport , where meteorologists have tracked the lights on radar . While experts concede that radar alone can be misleading , it does add weight to reports and suggests that something might be afoot . <p> And in Alabama , an accounting teacher and mother of two says her abduction by aliens was harrowing . Her story , precise in its detail , echoes the claims of hundreds of other alleged abductees who have come out of the closet of late . But given all the recent research on false memory syndrome , can anyone accept her account , rendered through deep hypnosis , as literally true ? Well , it might be easier to evaluate if some of the evidence described by abductee Leah Haley turns out to be real . From odd scratches and scoops on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged harassment by military men in fatigues , Haley claims to have a plethora of evidence that sets her story apart from other , more anecdotal tales . <p> These incidents all have one thing in common : They offer evidence that can be analyzed , fertile ground for Omni 's newest venture , Project Open Book . In our effort to examine the UFO phenomenon , our basic question is clear : In the midst of all the sightings , all the claims and counterclaims , all the abduction scenarios , conspiracy theories , and hype , is there any incontrovertible evidence , solid as nuts and bolts and plain as day , of visitation from on high ? <p> We feel we are in a good position to pose this question because we have no axe to grind . As an editorial staff , we are not yet convinced the invasion has begun . Yet we do n't have the knee-jerk instinct to debunk material just because it 's weird . Yes , we agree the universe is vast enough and evolution flexible enough to forge intelligent species throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet we feel the feat of interstellar travel would be tricky , even for geniuses of the cosmic kind . In the end , there 's just one thing we sense for sure : The UFO data suggests a mystery  --  unabiding , unresolved and sometimes downright spooky  --  in which strange phenomena continue to go unexplained . <p> In our search for evidence , explaining is mostly what we aim to do . As investigators have found in the past , the large majority of UFO sightings are rooted in the mundane . Whether sightings have proved to be practical jokes and hoaxes , meteors , cloud formations , ball lightning , Soviet satellites , or " black " aircraft under development in the United States , some 90 percent of all UFO reports investigated are eventually explained . Just sift through our past columns on the subject , and you will see that finding real-world explanations for the UFO phenomenon has been our impetus throughout . <p> In seeking to explain , moreover , Open Book will continue to embrace Omni 's longstanding policy of informed skepticism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenet : Extraordinary claims require extraordinary levels of proof . In our philosophical universe , if we do not work hard to find an explanation  --  an ordinary explanation  --  for each and every case we look into , then our work has not been done . When we send our researchers out to sift through evidence for signs of E.T. , you can bet your bottom dollar the terrible burden of proof will stay with us . And Open Book 's final query will always be the same : Is there any evidence that proves , to our satisfaction and beyond the shadow of a doubt , that the alien interpretation of UFOs is for real ? <p> UFO researchers have attempted to address this issue from the start . One of the first to try to bring the scrutiny of science to bear on UFO sightings was the late Dr. J. Allen Hynek , who , during the 1940s and 1950s , worked as an astronomer at the Smithsonian , Northwestern University , Ohio State University , and Harvard , producing rigorous papers on electronic satellite tracking and supernovas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Air Force , looking into UFO reports for the notorious Project Blue Book . Although Blue Book has , in recent years , been discredited as a PR organ of an Air Force intent on debunking any and all UFO reports , Hynek himself went through a conversion at its helm . As he followed " the program , " squelching one UFO flap after the next , he began to doubt his own words . " Somewhere along the line , " he told Omni , " I realized that I was n't being scientifically honest . The sightings needed further investigation , but we were disregarding them , throwing the data away . " <p> That realization put Hynek on a path he would follow for the rest of his life . He began making copies of all the documents to come out of Blue Book and gathered data that would allow him to study UFOs as they had never been studied before . He classified the various types of reports and even traveled around the country investigating the more interesting ones . Hynek agreed that many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held , there was " nothing in the accepted scientific paradigm to explain them all . " <p> His obsession resulted , in 1973 , in the founding of the Center for UFO Studies in Evanston , Illinois . Out of this small operation , run mostly through the donations of friends , he produced respected papers and monographs in a field replete with misguided enthusiasts , psychopaths , and frauds . <p> In the end , the so-called science of J. Allen Hynek went soft . Critics , and even friends , began to say he 'd become shockingly gullible . He spent some of his last days in the luxurious Arizona home of a wealthy , but " anonymous " benefactor who subscribed to a psychic interpretation of UFOs and promised Hynek he would create for him the most lavish UFO center in the world . When Hynek died of brain cancer in April 1986 , it was easy for sympathizers to say he 'd gone insane . <p> Today , Hynek 's legacy  --  his original notion that UFOs could be studied with as much scientific rigor as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of serious researchers and open-minded skeptics who continue to sift through evidence , seeking to make sense of the data , to explain . It is in this spirit , and in hopes of doing what Blue Book could n't , that Project Open Book turns its first page . <p> Because proof , if it exists , might be out there anywhere , we have asked our readers to help . Already , our call for evidence has been heard . Thousands of readers have written , sending us their thoughts , perceptions and suspicions , their photographs , video- and audio-tapes , their samples of earthly ( or unearthly ? ) leaves , rocks , and offerings from backyards and mountaintops throughout the country and the world . <p> A reader from Canada describes a mysterious object he says smashed into the waters of Shag Harbour , Nova Scotia , three decades ago . " What the Shag Harbour UFO crash lacks in high drama , it gains in solid documentation , " this eloquent letter states . " There were many witnesses , and virtually no one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has forgotten the event . I am still uncovering new evidence , and have even interviewed witnesses from the Royal Canadian Air Force , Coast Guard , and Police . " <p> A reader from Staunton , Virginia , described " a bright red " disc in the night sky above his home . " In the middle were four round black circles , " he reports . " When the object floated over the apartments , it seemed to stop and turn one of its sides up . Then it did something really wonderful  --  it blinked a good-bye . Its speed seemed to go from 200 miles an hour to God-knows-what , and it was gone . " <p> And from the owner of a bed and breakfast inn and dairy farm in northern Vermont , we heard this : " Sunday , January 6 , 1994 I had two guests from Washington , DC . We had been watching . a video and when it went off , everyone was heading up to bed . My husband was already upstairs . but my son and I and one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to check the outside temperature . We went over to my large front window to look out at the thermometer ( it was - 28 degrees Fahrenheit ) and we saw two bright lights in the sky across the street . I thought ' helicopter . ' But there was n't any noise and the two lights were spaced very wide apart . It moved so slowly . We just looked at each others saying ' What is it ? ' Regardless of the ! cold , we ran out onto my front porch . It was a very gray sky that night , with the threat of snow . The object  --  two large rectangle shapes connected by a central square or triangle  --  was slowly moving directly toward us , without a sound , and flew almost directly over our heads . Only then did I hear a faint rumble , like a deeper version of the sound you hear when you place a large seashell up to your ear . " This witness reports that the local newspaper , the County Courier , eventually carried the story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In all , eight people reported the sighting , " she recalls . <p> Finally , we received three separate missives on the saucerlike designs registered at the U.S. Patent Office . " There are patents in the patent office describing certain flying aircraft not of conventional design , " one reader tells us . His claim : The patents link many people who have worked on special or secret projects . Another reader goes even further . " I have spent several years researching current hardware available to build these craft , " he states . A third informant sent us , via overnight delivery , more than one hundred photo-copied sheets of the patents themselves . <p> But conventional mail , via " pony express , " is not the only conduit to Open Book . As our online devotees have discovered , they can reach us through America Online as well . ( To get to the Open Book bulletin board , type Keyword : OMNI . Then click Antimatter . Click Message Board . Click List Topics . And go to REAL PROJECT OPEN BOOK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mentioned the so-called triangle craft , recently witnessed over California and elsewhere in the United States . " During the winter of 1992-1993 , I was at Beale AFB , Marysville , California , and was in my backyard with my telescopes , " explained one of our online regulars . " I am an amateur astronomer with over thirty years ' experience , and was also a trained photo intelligence specialist in all types of systems . The date was around the third of March at about 10:30 p.m . Pacific Standard Time . I had just walked out of my warm-up shed and was walking back to my telescopes about ten feet away when I noticed something floating above me , going from southeast to northwest . The craft was a triangle shape with two rows of lights going around the middle on the two sides and was a light gray on the bottom , possibly from the reflected lights of the housing area I lived in . There was no sound of any type and no sign of engines . The craft looked to be as thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flown in many times . The corners and sides were curved and were only broken by the two rows of lights . As I stood there with my mouth open , the craft traveled out of sight toward the PAVE PAWS radar site , about two miles away . For a long time , I thought what I saw was the new Mach +6 reconnaissance plane that has flown near Beale for many years , but on reflection , the craft was too thick ( 30 to 50 feet ) to travel at such speeds . Having worked with the SR71 , I can . say I have never seen a craft like this , and others here in the Sacramento Valley have also seen the same type of craft in January and February of this year .... Any ideas ? " <p> Since ideas are the currency Open Book trades in online , our posters have given us quite a few . For instance , our online participants have helped us fine-tune our notion of what is and what is not legitimate " proof . " A few people pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important toot , is not valid as the only evidence of a . UFO . " Since radar is dependent upon electromagnetic waves . " we were told , " it may be easily distorted by other electromagnetic waves that are man-made or natural in origin . " <p> Our online board has also sponsored a lively discussion on the type of evidence required to prove that bona fide extraterrestrials have , in fact , been in touch with alleged abductees . The consensus can be summed up by this posting : Real evidence , it was suggested , would come when , following abduction , an alleged abductee could deliver " advance information of an astronomical or physical nature , not known to contemporary science but checkable or verifiable ex post facto . " <p> To help us evaluate the evidence , we have chosen a small but balanced panel of experts ( see sidebar ) . Because we need people experienced at UFO investigation , we have selected a number of researchers allied with the UFO camp ; all UFO researchers on our panel have been noted not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of their skeptical work . To give some credence to the other side of the realm , moreover , we have solicited the help of some noted skeptics . Intent on policing the UFO field , these panel members will help us make sure we never let down our guard . To provide background-and expertise , we have recruited experts in aerospace and military craft . To shed some light on the human mind , we have asked for help from a few psychologists . And , because Omni 's roots are , ultimately , journalistic , we 've selected a number of investigative reporters who will wield their craft to go through data , coming up with what we hope is a semblance of truth . <p> Already , their investigations have begun . A. J. S. Rayl , an investigative journalist most recently writing and producing a CD-ROM on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence ( or SETI ) , is speaking with Leah Haley , the accountant-abductee . Jerome Clark , editor of the International UFO Reporter , is researching the Holland , Michigan , sightings . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trail of abduction cases in which multiple witnesses ( and/or multiple abductees ) claim to have been involved . Other Open Book panelists have been assigned to investigate the saucerlike designs in the U.S. Patent Office . the Nova Scotia water crash , and the bed-and-breakfast sighting in Vermont . <p> Our panel has also been poking around in the past . Longtime Omni writer Paul McCarthy , for instance , was intrigued by reports that an Army Air Corps nurse helped autopsy aliens recovered from a UFO that crashed near Roswell , New Mexico , in July 1947-and then just disappeared . Top Roswell researchers , in fact , told McCarthy they had attempted to find her along with other Roswell nurses to no avail , suggesting , perhaps , that they 'd been intentionally deleted from the record for good . McCarthy decided to track the nurses , and thus far , has had astonishing good luck . ( Look for his Open Book report in an upcoming Omni . ) <p> And James Oberg , our longtime resident skeptic , an aerospace engineer , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back a decade to 1984 . His current assignment : bringing new evidence to bear on a Soviet sighting already touted as having it all  --  visual , radar , and physical effects . Just added to the mix , Oberg tells us , is a series of sketches that now may shed light on the origin of the mysterious apparition as it changed shape , color , and size . <p> Today , these researchers will help Open Book move forward , joining other serious groups across the spectrum , from the Mutual UFO Network ( MUFON ) to the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal ( CSICOP ) , who have been investigating the phenomenon for years . Thanks to our readers , our efforts will be fueled by reports coming in at a steady pace from around the world . With our own perspective , our own techniques , and our own special panel , we throw our hat into the ring . We have no way of knowing what we will find  --  or if we will find anything at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look into must provide plentiful evidence to analyze , dissect , and explore . From our camp , without such elements as multiple witnesses , physical traces , medical documentation , or electromagnetic effects , you have nothing at all . <p> In marking our place on the UFO map , we evoke the trajectory of our near-namesake  --  the frustrated Project Blue Book  --  and its leader , J. Allen Hynek himself . In the end , Hynek could not use science to unlock the mystery of the UFO , as he had planned . Near the end of his life , ensconced in a grand hacienda in the heart Of Arizona 's Quartz Mountain , he glimpsed a geographic wonder : a mammoth slab of rock sculpted by nature to resemble a monk kneeling in prayer . In this gorgeous spot called Paradise Canyon , Hynek discovered fervor in his calling . Moved more by religion than reason , more by mysticism than science , Hynek the investigator was finally swept away . For him the dream had come to this : " i 've often said that someday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Maine , " he told Omni . " I imagine myself in front of the fireplace , keeping my friends entertained for many nights , with one interesting tale after the next . I 'd enjoy being given the chance , as long as the food held out . " <p> But now , at the cusp of the twenty-first century , the busboy has come and cleared the food away . In a sense , it 's sad : Who can deny an attraction to the stories ? After all , from a literary perspective , UFO yarns can now unequivocally take their place among the greatest ghost stories and science-fiction stories of our time . No doubt about it , from the tragicomic plight of the closet abductee and her frail , haft-human " hybrid " heirs to the ominous stalwart bureaucrat who keeps crashed saucers and alien bodies under lock and key , magnificent UFO stories , rich in social commentary and psychological truth , abound . The heroes of these tales , be they missing nurses or pale hybrid children lost forever to the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We will continue to listen to their cries . But now it is also time to move on . Kicking and screaming , we must let loose our grip on these riveting , best-bred allegories and embrace the evidence , leaving literary conceits behind . <p> On this cautious note , and in hopes Of finding some answers , our investigation begins . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> ARTICLE BY MELA WEINTRAUB ; ILLUSTRATION BY CHRIS MOORE <p> TEAM OPEN BOOK MEMBERS OF OUR PANEL , LISTED BELOW , WILL HELP US TURN A PAGE IN UFO RESEARCH .
