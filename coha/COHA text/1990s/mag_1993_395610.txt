Melanie Smith remembers well that January day two years ago when she found out she was pregnant . " At first I felt scared , " says Melanie , who at the time was a junior at Spelman College in Atlanta . " How was I going to tell my mother ? Was I going to walk around college pregnant ? What would happen ? " What happened is that Melanie decided to have her baby . And doing so , she joined the ranks of the 4.9 million African-American mothers with children under the age of 18 ; of those mothers , according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics , 3 million are single rooms . Approximately 1.8 million of those single mothers , like Melanie , also work at jobs outside their home . Heaven knows that single mothers have been part of our community for centuries . Ever since the first slave ship unloaded its human cargo on these shores , African-American families have been in a state of flux . Slavery separated husband from wife , father from son and grandparent from grandchild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much so that , more than a century after it was abolished , we 're still reeling in its wake and trying to overcome racism 's present-day strains on our families . And while it 's true that our community has had  --  and continues to have  --  Western society 's " traditional " family units ( mom , dad and children ) , it 's also true that millions of well-to-do , middle-class , poor , divorced , widowed and never-married sisters have successfully raised families without a mate . Strong sisters , loving sisters , determined sisters  --  like Melanie Smith  --  are striving to do the best they can . " My goal , " Melanie says , " is never to give up . I always try to excel at whatever I 'm doing  --  for myself , and for Tyler . " Tyler Renee Willingham , Melanie 's daughter , now nearly 2 years old , shares a one-bedroom apartment with her mom in Atlanta . On Tyler 's side of their beige-and-white bedroom is a crib , a diaper pail and two Minnie Mouse posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresser and a group of family photographs . Melanie , now 25 and a Delta Airlines reservations-sales agent , works the day shift and usually gets to the baby-sitter 's with Tyler by 8:30 each morning . She works from 9 until 5 , then picks Tyler up from the baby-sitter 's by 5:30 . Once at home , Smith 's second shift begins : She cooks dinner , eats , watches Jeopardy ! with Tyler , reads her daughter a story and gives her a snack ; then , by 8:30 , she puts Tyler to bed . When she has a day off , Melanie sometimes takes Tyler to the baby-sitter anyway so that she can work out at her health club . Gone are those carefree days before Tyler was horn , when , as an employee of Eastern Airlines , Melanie jetted around the country on a whim during school holidays and partied on weekends into the wee hours of the morning . " I 'm not the same person now that I have a child . When you become a parent , things change , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since Melanie 's early single-working-mother days . " Tyler was about 8 weeks old when I went back to work  --  and I was still in school , " explains Melanie . " After school was over , I 'd go and pick Tyler up by four o'clock and get her to my second babysitter . At that time I was working for Delta on the evening shift , from 5:30 P.M to 2:00 A.M. Then I 'd pick Tyler up , go home and get some sleep . " Through personal willpower  --  and with the support of some understanding professors  --  Melanie kept to this schedule for about a year . Now , after a few on-again , off-again semesters to accommodate motherhood and full-time work , Melanie returned to college this spring . She is due to complete her B.A. in psychology soon . Juggling career , family and school can be a struggle for married mothers . And when you 're a single parent , the challenge can he even greater . Many single moms find it necessary to move back home or in close proximity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determined to finish the college education she started 2,000 miles away from her immediate family in Seattle , her hometown . In Atlanta , with the help of her own network and sisterhood of support , Melanie says , " I 'm making it . " RUNNING A FAMILY AND A COMPANY So is April Rhone , a single working mother , who runs her own business out of the Dallas home she shares with her mother and her three children . At 31 , April has been married and divorced three times . She 's the mother of two sons and a daughter , Chris 13 , Duonne , 12 , and 1-year-old Ketu Sophic . As a solo mother running her own company , April says , " My philosophy is to put business before pleasure . I 've got to get my business off the ground ; then , when everything is going the way it should , I can chill . " April 's company , Afri-Concepts , markets lunch boxes , backpacks , bookmarks , binders , little girl 's purses and T-shirts that are decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malcolm X. Becoming an entrepreneur took patience and determination . In 1987 , after working at various jobs , April packed up her family and moved from Texas to California to enroll in an undergraduate program at California State University , Long Beach . Like Melanie Smith , April had to balance family and school life . Some days , while attending classes , she took her sons with her . Through grants , loans and public assistance , April scraped by financially . When school got really tough , April sent her children to live with their paternal grandmother for a semester . In 1988 the boys returned to their mom in California , and April 's real-world education began . Getting Afri-Concepts off the ground has taken several years and a move back to Dallas . Now that her company is up and running , April has big plans : " I 'd like to build an empire  --  but not just a financial one , " April says , " I think reaching our people is the most important thing . " GOING FOR THE GUSTO Lydia Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League of Essex County , New Jersey , says that her job as a single working mother is much easier now that sons Tehuti and Issa have graduated from college . But it was n't always that way . In fact , Lydia , 47 , a former welfare caseworker , found herself receiving welfare shortly after her husband , she says , " left a note on my pillow " and walked out about 18 years ago . Ironically , when she applied for welfare , Lydia 's former colleagues " did n't know if they should speak to me or act as if they did n't see me , " she says . " I think they were more embarrassed than I was . " Lydia also knew she had to get off welfare two years later when a problem with a check caused one son , only 5 years old at the time , to complain loudly about not getting " their " money . " Being educated in sociology and psychology and having worked as a caseworker , I recognized that as being the beginning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , walking up that street , I realized I had to get out . " Lydia sold her diamond engagement ring so she could afford day care for her sons and have bus fare to go on job interviews . Since she could type , she landed a job as a secretary . Most important , Lydia began formulating a plan for her life . " I estimated that I 'd be about 41 before I got to the age where I could run around and do things without worrying about baby-sitters and such , and I would still probably be young enough to catch up with my career and to have a life , " she says . " So I made a conscious choice  --  I mean a very conscious choice  --  to focus on my kids . " For a while , Lydia postponed going to graduate school ; Cub Scouts , movies and soccer games took priority . But , remembers Lydia , " Somewhere in my mid-thirties I was feeling resentful of the fact that I did n't have clothes and I could n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then Lydia 's single friends partied every Friday night . " Then I realized that the only difference between myself and any other parent is that I did n't have a partner . If I 'd had a partner , I would n't have been running out the door on Friday night  --  I 'd be home and quite content . So I decided that I 'd have to be content with my children . " For the most part , raising her sons has been rewarding and fulfilling for Lydia  --  and the result of hanging in there speaks for itself . Lydia 's older son , Tehuti , 24 , is a recent graduate from the Rutgers University College of Engineering . Issa , a 22-year-old Hampton University graduate , was awarded a prestigious fellowship from the Woodrow Wilson Program in Public Policy and International Affairs ( worth $26,640 for the 1993-94 school year ) to attend the Irving B. Harris Graduate School of Public Policy Studies at the University of Chicago . And Lydia , who eventually did earn a master 's in public administration , now looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was rough , but I do n't regret it . Not even for one half a second , " she says . " As single mothers , we do n't have to settle for the minimum that society has to offer . We can go for the gusto ! " Joy Duckett Cain is the parenting editor of ESSENCE . <p>
