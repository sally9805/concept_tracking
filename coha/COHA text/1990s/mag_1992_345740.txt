George Bush is a survivor . Faced with political extinction in 1988 , he promised voters " no new taxes " and won the White House in return . Two years later , he raised taxes in exchange for a budget deal . But when polls in Georgia showed that even country-club Republicans thought Bush was a flip- flopper who did n't stand for anything , Bush pulled another abrupt about- face . " This tax thing is still really bothering people , is n't it ? " Bush mused to an Oval Office visitor last Monday morning . " Maybe I should clear the air . " <P> Within hours , Bush had renounced the 1990 budget deal as the biggest mistake of his presidency . " If I had that to do over , I would n't do it , " Bush told an interviewer from the Atlanta Journal . To a local television station , Bush added , " Anytime you get hammered on something , I guess you want to redo it . " Democrats seized on the stunning reversal to charge the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about presidential leadership , " said House Budget chairman Leon Panetta . " They do n't want a President who says he 's sorry every two days . " <P> Like the Democratic primary campaign , the Republican race was settling into a two-man contest  --  between Bush and his lesser self . Gone is the commander of Desert Storm , the man who confidently vowed that Saddam Hussein 's aggression " will not stand . " In his place is a calculating politician who whines about " flak . " Rather than telling Americans why he wants another four years and what he intends to do with them , Bush is repudiating one of the few domestic accomplishments of his first term  --  a successful budget compromise that cut and capped spending , raised taxes and reduced government borrowing by nearly $500 billion . <P> Far from appeasing those who resented his broken promises , the President 's reversals could only make supporters wonder when and where the next switch will take place . Even top White House officials are flabbergasted . " I do n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are doing is simply unbelievable . " <P> It was hard to tell if the President 's desperate act did much good at the polls last Tuesday . As expected , Bush won every contest handily , boosting his delegate count over TV commentator Pat Buchanan 148 to 20 . But Buchanan continued to draw a solid third in the Republican contests ; in Georgia , where he concentrated his efforts , Buchanan won 36% . The next morning , in a move he admitted was " presumptuous , " Buchanan called on Bush to get out of the race . Buchanan , said Bush spokesman Marlin Fitzwater , " has gone Looney Tunes on us.
