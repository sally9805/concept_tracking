the pillow seemed to be calling her name . Lying in bed , she felt casual and unrushed , and it took her a few moments to remember that she was right in the middle of a workweek . She had to get up soon , but she wanted to enjoy the moment . Besides , there was no way she could move without waking her husband . Her back was pressing against his chest , his arms were crisscrossing her breasts and resting against her belly , and his legs , wrapped around hers , were holding her tight . The closeness of his body was soothing to her , like a slow song just getting into the groove . could best extricate herself from . She was n't a small woman , but Satchel 's body was a human tree trunk . She wriggled a bit , but his arms did n't give . Then she glanced over her shoulder at him . His eyes were shut . His face was serene . His lips were twitching . Maxine started to laugh . her stomach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a feeling she 'd become accustomed to over the last three months . " Satchel , let me up . Quick . " kept his hand on the back of her neck , and even while she vomited , the comfort of his fingers stroking her was n't entirely lost . Only a little came up , and when she was finished she felt better , as though a too tight collar had been loosened . Her doctor had told her she 'd stop feeling sick soon ; it was the first time she 'd vomited all week . Satchel rinsed a washcloth and began wiping her face . The coolness against her skin , the effortless transition from sickness to health , sharpened her senses , making her conscious of the happiness and gratitude that filled her , even though she was n't looking forward to the day ahead . She opened the window next to the sink . The early-April air that floated inside was chilly and a little sweet . edge of the tub , next to Satchel .

Ten years from now she 'll be hiring me to sue them . " rest of the money . They 're both her managers . ' Please let our child be a nerd with yearnings for the hallowed halls of ivy , " Satchel said . He was looking at her breasts . Maxine folded her arms across her chest and lowered her head . for nine , yet the fullness of her soon-to-be-maternal breasts excited him and made her shy . work yet ? " he asked . She did n't move . Satchel slid closer to her and kept stroking her fingers as though he had all the time in the world . She rested her head against his shoulder .

The synapses in her brain turned into computer keys , clicking , clicking . Without even putting on her suit , she was transformed into a woman with a comma and a title after her name . Executive Producer . Her second skin . the television on . " It 's a short segment . Two or three minutes , " Maxine said . very tall . Television made him appear larger than life . What they did n't realize was that it was n't his body but his personality that loomed beyond the confines of the screen . Ted 's megawatt smile -- equal parts good cheer and good teeth -- seemed to leap out and pull people to him . Today he wore a bright multicolored sweater over a tie and shirt . The bright hues complemented his ruddy , boyish face . His expression said : I 'm the party ; let 's have a ball . his three minutes in front of a camera . that men are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His voice was friendly and easygoing . " Do n't ask me how I 'm privileged with such information , " he said , wiping his mouth with the back of his hand , a long , exaggerated movement , " but just take it from me , Kim : you 're making the cereal soggy all over southern California . " He flashed his sunny smile , and the anchor giggled . but I understand that you have another interest , that the world is n't aware of yet . You 're the chair of this year 's Special Olympics .

" to talk with a convicted killer on death row , as we discuss the pros and cons of the death penalty . " a hard run . Seeing him interviewed made her anxious , but now she could relax . When he did well , it was a testimony to her judgment and guidance . Ted had the raw talent , but she had shaped his malleable charisma and charm into a more marketable product . His success underscored her own and reminded her how far she 'd come from a scarred brick row house in North Philadelphia . that Maxine lived with Lindy , her grandmother , after her mother died . For the first seven years , Lindy raised her in between singing for their supper in nightclubs , at concerts and revues , up and down the East Coast . She 'd appeared on television too . Maxine could remember pieces of her earlier life , with her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had years of feast and others of famine . Yet even during the bad times , her grandmother managed to instill in Maxine hope for the future and enough drive and ambition to go after more than North Philly could give her . the warm spray and the soapy lather and the feel of the washcloth against her skin more since she 'd become pregnant . She liked looking at her body , especially when she was wet , and rubbing her hands across her belly , touching her breasts . It was true : they were fuller , overflowing her A cups when she put on her bra , and her stomach looked rounder too . Even though this pregnancy seemed to be progressing normally , all she had to do was think about how the first had ended unexpectedly , in pain , blood , and tears , to realize that there were no guarantees . Please do n't let me miscarry , she prayed . in the bedroom they used for working out . She stood in the open doorway and watched as his tall body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maxine could tell that he 'd gone into his " zone . " His dark eyes were closed ; his wide mouth was relaxed and open . His elegant movements seemed incongruous for such a big , rough-looking man . His neck was too thick for her to circle with her hands . He had a full head of coarse hair , and his face was more friendly than handsome ; but there was something besides friendliness that made most women look twice . She sensed immediately that his solidity was more than physical . Men appeared to like him , and he had a lot of " play " sisters , who wanted to check her out and make sure she was n't going to break their brother 's heart . She learned to trust them and came to admire Satchel because women who were n't in love with him cared about his heart . It was one of his " girlfriends " who 'd told her that he 'd worked at night and on weekends during high school to help support his mother and two sisters after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

They had agreed that the workout room was the best choice for the nursery , since it got plenty of light and faced the backyard . The only other bedroom would be put to use , as well . she 'll be in the guest room for at least a few weeks , " Maxine said . nuts , but Maxine could n't imagine having a baby without Lindy 's being there to help her ; she 'd be so happy when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with her . " Of course she 'll come . " an old Ojays song in his loud , decidedly off-key voice . She poked her head into the bathroom . " See you , " she called . newly remodeled kitchen . Looking around , she felt pleased . In five years they 'd converted their large Spanish stucco house , from the dark " needs a little TLC " fixer-upper that the broker had sold them , into an elegant home . Satchel had set a place for her at the table in the adjacent breakfast room , with a bowl , a package of instant oatmeal , a banana , and a glass of skim milk . Her vitamins were on a paper napkin . Maxine mixed water with the oatmeal and put it in the microwave . She ate quickly , drank the milk , swallowed the vitamins , and slipped the banana into her purse . On her way out , she stopped to gaze through the picture window , admiring her rose- and azalea-filled garden , the pool , and the panoramic view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always made her think she was about to take flight .
