Washington , D.C. June 20 He paused at the top of the moving stairs and looked down to where it was dark . That was the way home . Maybe tonight , if he arrived at a decent hour , it would be different . No arguments . No shouting about where he had been , about why he never was around , about the money for this , the money for that , about her loneliness , her disappointment . And none of the silence that followed , during which they realized there was nothing else to shout , say , or whisper . Other commuters pushed past as he considered . He watched the steps appear out of nowhere . Do it , a voice saida voice from an earlier day . Break the pattern . Put one foot forward . Descend to the train . Stride through the townhouse door sooner than expected , carrying flowers , winedo it , he thought . Everything might change . He pictured her at home , fixed in anger , blaming him for all of it . Waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the available target . He stared down the escalator . Tomorrow , he said to himself . He opened his umbrella , walked up Connecticut Avenue in the sticky rain , entered the Mayflower Hotel , and headed straight to the bar . The thick-necked bartender with a boxer 's nose greeted him with a nod . The same bar , once again . Shit , last week , he had been quoted in a newspaper profile about the bartenderthe guy had won some contestand the story described him as a five-nights-a-week regular . This was a spot to be left alone.But three nights ago a heavy-bearded fellow insisted on buying him drinks to celebrate some unspecified triumph and spent an hour trying to find a common link with him . Someone he knew who knew someone who knew someone who knew him . No such person was found . The place was not crowded . Probably the rain , he thought . He took off his suit jacket , sat at the bar , and ordered a vodka and tonic . His hands gripped the rail . It ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window at people rushing home . He watched a famous television reporter hail a cab . Ca n't go on , he repeated silently . The fights with his wife . The trouble at the office . They were threatening to force a new assignment on him after he had been in his current position for only three months . He had given years to the service and had been awarded with a prestigious posting . Now they were complaining . Your concentration is just not there , they said . Something at home ? Something else ? They did n't have the guts to say it : the drinking ? They probably had seen that story in the paper . In any event , they said , there 's this new man we want to try . They had wanted him out this week . He had managed to postpone any change until after the Fourth . Maybe in the next two weeks he could ... Spent , he thought . Spent . His gaze fixed on two old men in dark suitsthey looked like brothersat a table by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to push on . He was finishing his third drink . She had been sitting next to him for several minutes before he noticed her . He turned when he saw the bartender 's eye hold on her , and he caught her face dead-on . " Do n't , " she said . " Do n't what ? " " Do n't turn away and pretend you were n't looking . " He started to talk . " No , no , " she interrupted . " You do n't have to say anything , no stupid excuses . I sat here because I wanted to meet you . There 's practically no one down here , and I wanted company . " Twenty-four , he guessed . Maybe Twenty-five . Teenage to thirty all seemed the same to him . Her hair was long , straightwhat they call chestnut brown ? her lips plump . Her eyeshe could n't tell in this light . Something was off . " They 're different . " He waited for her to continue . " My eyes . You probably ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gray . " In front of her was a notebook with the logo of the Department of Justice . She moved it aside . " In town for a conference , " she said . " A lawyer ? " " No work talk . I know this is Washington , but let 's pretend it 's not for a few minutes . " He lifted his drink in a silent toast . The bartender placed a scotch before her and moved off . He watched where the glass met her lips . He had stopped thinking about leaving the bar . He signaled for a vodka and tonic . He decided not to wonder why this was happening , not to worry that his hair was thinning and that he was developing a slump . She talked about growing up in Michigan and fishing trips with her father in the Upper Peninsula . He told her he left college to be a jazz pianist . They ordered another round . She mentioned a brother who had died in a car crash . He told her about the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not believe him and laughed as he tried to convince her . " Alexia , " she said , holding out her hand . " Or Alex . " " Brady . " He grasped her hand . After two hours of talking , she asked if he would escort her to her room . He said yes . This was better , he thought , much better , than once again having to call a friend in search of a bed or couch where he could wait out another night . In the elevator , his arm brushed against hers . He thought about the escalator to the Metro . Both looked straight ahead . When the door opened , she took his hand . They walked past a maid toward her room . At the door , she looked for her key in her bag and dropped her notebook . He picked it up and noticed the first page was blank . " A boring conference ? " he asked . " Are n't they all ? " She opened the door . The room was dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch . He smelled her hair . The light came on . She closed the door behind them . " Alex , " he started to say . The door to the bathroom swung open . Neither of them saw the gun . Nor did they hear the shot that tore through Brady 's head . And before she could scream , she was dead , too . The assailant knelt over the dead man and emptied his pockets . From the pile , he selected one item . He then went through her bag and found the microcassette recorder he had given her . He pushed the rewind button , waited , and pressed the play button . " Seriously , one time Monk came in when we were playing in this West Side dive , and he " He put out the " Do Not Disturb " sign , went to the bed , and lay down , his head against the pillows . He reached for the remote control and turned on CNN . He looked at what he had retrieved from the dead mana laminated press pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listened to the tape , fast-forwarding whenever the woman spoke . He watched the television , with the sound turned off . Chapter Two The White House West WingJune 21 Another trip to New Orleans . Nick Addis was not looking forward to it . He pushed around the papers on his desk . He could n't sort out the mess : checks , tax returns , land records . He read the memo again . Re-create the trail . Find anyone who knew anything . Go to New Orleans . Do n't tell anyone . But if anybody asks , do n't say you 're not going . He looked at the bare walls . Another reorganization , another shuffle of offices was under way . Too many people here , he thought , care more about where their desks are located than anything else . Next to his own desk was a stack of boxes and pile of books . On top of the books was a framed postcard from LaTeenah Williams , a student he had fifteen years ago when he taught American history in a East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Addis , the son of two Columbia University professors , had postponed his plan to attend Yale Law School and answered the call of the New York City public school system , which , facing a teacher shortfall , had instituted an emergency recruitment program . Addis was placed in a school where he was one of four white teachers . He spent two years riding the subway each morning and plotting how to engage his uncaring students in the history of the United States . The slavery tradewhat happened to slaves who rebelled ? The building of the transcontinental railroadhow many Chinese laborers were worked to death ? The California gold rushwho in the class realized that it led to the most severe slaughter of Native Americans in the country 's entire history ? The Jim Crow erawho knew that Joshua Gibson , a star in the negro baseball league , hit more home runs in a season than Babe Ruth ? Half the class had not been able to identify Babe Ruth . Few students took his bait . Most were more concerned with avoiding the violence in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby being carried by this or that student . But LaTeenah Williams , a short , slight girl with a long neck and large eyes , had been one of the few students who had listened and absorbed . Years later , Addis still remembered the report she had written on how President Johnson manuevered civil rights legislation through Congress , cutting deals to win a greater good . Addis had encouraged her to go to college and helped with her applications . She sent him the postcard when she started City University . " Teachers make us all , " she had written . " Thank you . " Last he had heard from Williamsand that was several years backshe had become a psychiatric social worker based at a hospital in the South Bronx . He stared at her deliberate handwriting and wondered how many people she had helped directly : a suicide prevented , an abused woman rescued from a personal hell , an addict placed into a treatment program . Could Addis claim a piece of these triumphs ? Even a small one ? Shit , here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I 'm thinking , maybe I should have stayed a teacher .... Then he recalled the evening at law school when he and the professor who ran the low-income law clinic had pulled an all-nighter to finish a petition for several families tossed out of a housing project for nonpayment . Why 'd you come to law school ? she had asked Addis . All he could offer was a clich : So I can take a swing or two at changing what I do n't like in our world . Very noble , she had said , but remember , the smallest victories are the truest . Addis thought about where he should place LaTeenah Williams 's postcard . He picked up a mounted cartoon : a caricature of the previous President at a podium , frantically waving his arms and saying , " Enrico Fermi , I. M. Pei , Lee loccocawhat sort of American names are these ? " Below the cartoon was an inscription : " Add Nicholai Addis to the list . Without you , none of this would have been possible . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , and dated the day of his inauguration . The cartoon referred to an event early in the presidential campaign . A foreign reporter had asked the President about a statement made by an aide to Louisiana Governor Bob Hanover , who was competing in the presidential primaries of the other party . The reporter had used Addis 's full first namegiven to Addis to honor a grandfather from Russiawhich nobody ever did . " Nicholai Addis ? " the President had replied . " What kind of American name is that ? " After days of unfavorable editorials , the President sent Addis a letter of apology and one of the shoes he had been wearing when he made the remark . " Finally got it out of my mouth , " the President had written . Addis then announced he was sending the shoe to a Washington goodwill store and called for the President to donate the other shoe . Days later , Addis checked with the thrift store . Nothing had arrived from the President . That evening when a network anchor was concluding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the candidate 's mind those frantic days . Hanover grinned : " Well , Mike , I 'm waiting for the other shoe . " Hanover 's quip made the cover of the major newspapers the following morning . He repeated it for days . Finally , the President donated a case of new shoes to the thrift shop . Addis 's face-off with the President turned him into a political celebrity . Photographs of the most influential campaign aide of the political season appeared in newspapers and newsmagazines . One long piece in a gossipy weekly speculated that Hanover had embraced Addis as a replacement for Hanover 's brother , a zookeeper and part-time evangelist in Orlando . A woman 's magazine put Addis on its first male cover : " Tall , Skinny , Pale , Nerdy : A Sex Symbol for Now . " His toothy , crooked smile stretched across a full page . That had been four years ago . In his barren officeno window this timeAddis looked at the unpacked boxes . The latest staff shuffle had been prompted by his own suggestion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the primaries had gone too well . Hanover 's reelection campaign , predictably , was attracting little attention from the media . Instead , the press was obsessed with the surprising rise of first-term Florida Governor Wesley Pratt , Hanover 's likely opponent in the November election . A onetime country-western singer who had entered politics merely five years ago , the handsome , silver-haired Pratt had won the Iowa caucuses of his party , with the backing of religious activists , and had gone on to sweep most of the subsequent contests . To counter Pratt 's momentum , Addis had in midspring proposed moving his party 's suspense-free convention from the sleepy days of August to the weekend of July 4 . Changing the date would bring more attention to the event , the party , and the President . It was , Addis recognized , a tacky idea : a rip-roaring , red-white-and-blue convention on America 's birthday . Satellite connections to Fourth of July celebrations across the country . Country singerswho were not for Prattrock stars , orchestras , marching bands . And fireworks , plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hotel owners , and others screamed about the hardships of moving the date . But Hanover said to do it . Several White House aides were transferred to the campaign office , replacements were appointed , and a series of office roulette had ensued since then . Somehow Addis had lost both his office window and his assistant in the most recent shift . Another assistant , the daughter of the ambassador to Portugal , was due to start tomorrow . Addis reread the latest memo from Chief of Staff Brewster McGreer . A reporter from a second-rate newspaper in Pittsburgh had been calling the White House press office , asking about an old land deal in Louisiana involving the Hanovers . No one on the staff knew anything about it . The President had provided McGreer the basic details : It had been a straight-forward property investment . We were in and out , he said . Picked up some money , declared it all . In his personal papers , Hanover had located some records . McGreer had forwarded the documents to Addis . Sort it all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm a worrier . Go to New Orleans . See who 's saying what . " Shit , New Orleans . Addis thought about his two previous trips to New Orleans . Nearly five years ago , the phone in his cluttered one-bedroom Washington apartment had rung past midnight . Governor Bob Hanover of Louisiana was on the line with an invitation . Could Addis drop by his office in New Orleans tomorrow ? A reservation already had been arranged for a morning flight , and Hanover had checked with Addis 's boss , Hugh Palmer , the Senate majority leader . " He 's all for it , " Hanover said with a laugh . Addis did n't have to ask what was on Hanover 's mind . He said he would be there . In Hanover 's office , the two had discussed strategy , the current state of the political culture , the themes that would move voters , excite donors , and impress editorial writers . They talked for three hours . Hanover , fifty-one years old , was square-faced , with a nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disciplined speckled hair of a politician . He was more handsome in person than on television . Toward the end of the conversation , Addis asked if he could pose a frank question . " I 'm waiting , " Hanover replied with a grin . " And nervous . " " Everyone who runs for president has his own personal motives for doing so . But , basically , they 're all driven . They all want to run the world , and they all believe they are singularly equipped to do so " " Naturally , " Hanover interrupted with a laugh . It was a solid laugh that came straight from his chest . " And a few of us are right . " " They all want to prove that , " Addis continued . " But why else do you want to be president . " " The high-minded answer , right ? " Hanover said . " How I want to help all Americans better their lives and that of their families , right ? Now , who is n't going to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed his fingertips together . He 's concentrating his sincerity , Addis thought . " This country , and the world , " Hanover said , " are entering new and uncertain times . The forces and institutions that are propelling and profiting from this transition do not , by design , have an interest in tempering the changes to ensure that we avoid the harsher consequences . After all , these consequences are born by those whose hands are far from the levers of power : blue-collar workers deindustrialized out of a job ; suburban moms who feel they have less control of their children and their communities ; minimum-wage workers in Silicon Valley blocked from joining a union ; young adults whose first jobs come with no benefits and no security . The global and national changes we must wrestle with are nearly inevitable , and the distribution of power in this nationand throughout the worldis mostly immutable . But there is room , there is space , for demanding that the concerns of those not at the table when the new order is arranged be considered and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never say this to a class of eighth gradersI doubt that one man can change the world . By that , I mean fundamentally transform it . Not even the President of the United States can stem certain tides . But he can do a helluva lot if he knows when and where to push . I think you and I , maybe with the help of one or two others " Hanover laughed again " can figure out where to push . Now , do I pass the audition ? " Hanover was smiling . He has deep eyes , Addis thought . Before Addis replied , Hanover drew a full breath and said , " I am going to be the next President of the United States , and I want you to be there with me . " As with Addis 's previous positionsspecial assistant to the chair of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission , counsel to the chair of the House Judiciary Committee , and chief of staff for the majority leader of the U.S. Senatehe had not had to apply for the job Hanover was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one important person had always referred Addis to another : There 's this young man , the most capable , intelligent , young man I 've met in years , who I think would be just right .... The jobs had come . Although Addis did not know who had recommended him to Hanover , he had prepared himself for this moment . He had plowed through piles of clips on Hanover and his potential rivals in the party . He knew all the details of the Hanover story : born to public school teachers in Baton Rouge , Harvard ' 66 , recon patrol in Vietnam , returned home with a commendation and appeared on Buckley 's show as a critic of the war , NYU Law , assistant professor at Tulane Law . Hanover ran for attorney generalpractically on a dareas a reform candidate . He attacked the machine hacks of his own party and was an unknown underdog written off by the political handicappers . Then a wing in a public hospital collapsed , killing seven children , the result of the shoddy work of a builder who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanover had campaigned against . The disaster brought him statewide and national notoriety . He won by fifteen points . As attorney general , Hanover successfully prosecuted those responsible for the hospital disaster and went on to become governor . It was a grand story , one of the best known in modern politics . Hanover even married the daughter of the businessman/fixer whose cronies had rigged the hospital contract . He was the only national political figure to be the subject of a made-for-television movie : For the Children : The Bob Hanover Story . Addis had watched it three times . Weeks before his meeting with Hanover , Addis had pored over the results of the last presidential election , congressional district by congressional district . He had done the calculations : Louisiana had few electoral votes , but it was next to Texas . He had covered as many angles as he could imagine . The race would be close , he had concluded . Any one of several could claim the nomination . But the best chance , in his estimation , resided with Hanover . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sitting behind his desk , Hanover had locked his gaze on Addis and passed his certainty to Addis . Yes , Addis thought , in a year-and-a-half , I 'll be in the White House , helping this man lead a nation . " I 'd be honored , " Addis told him . He stood to leave . The two shook hands . But then Addis remembered . One other thing . He had promised his girlfriend , Holly Rudd , that they would go to the next New Orleans Jazz Festival . They had missed the past twoeach time he had had to cancel due to workand he had vowed that this time they would be there . " It 's when the western primaries are " Hanover interrupted : " If I am rightand I amone weekend wo n't make a difference . Whenever you can , Nick , keep your promises . " In his White House office , Addis looked at the computer screen : 1407 POTUS/Residence . The screen told him and other senior staff where the President of the United States was at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant Hanover was moving . Now Addis could see the President was in the family residence of the East Wing . He imagined Hanover trying on different ties , preparing for the afternoon press conference . Addis opened the small refrigerator in the corner of his office and took out a can of Coke . One weekend wo n't make a difference . Hanover had been wrong about that . Addis and Holly Rudd did make it to New Orleans for the music festival . They saw the shows at the fairgrounds ; they dined at four-star restaurants . Wherever the couple went , well-wishers interrupted them . Local politicos and passersby urged Addis to send heartfelt messages to their campaigning governor . People asked to have their photograph taken with him . They all smelled a win . Hanover 's rivals for the nomination were fading ; he was on track to the nomination . Rudd did not mind any of this , even though she and Addis had not seen each other in six weeks . He was working out of the campaign office in Washington , when not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm in New York City and spending time in Austin assisting with the appeal of a convict on death row . Ever since she and Addis had interned at the Death Penalty Legal Defense Fund during law school , she had worked pro bono for the outfit . Then the weekend went bad . McGreer called Addis on Sunday morning . Donny Lee Mondreau , a twenty-six-year-old retarded black man sentenced to death for murdering a convenience store owner in Point Coupee Parish was going to be executed by lethal injection in two days . A reporter had asked if Hanover intended to be in his office during the execution . It had not been on Hanover 's overflowing schedule . Instead , he was due to be in California for a series of fundraisers . A day of conference calls followed . While Addis was on the phone , Rudd went shopping . When she returned , he informed her of the decision : Hanover would interrupt his campaign to fly back to Louisiana . Staring at the boxes next to his desk , Addis once again replayed the conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damnit , Nick , it 's just for politics . A campaign ad in blood . " " You know , he 's always been for it . " " Yeah , and you went to work for him . " " We 've talked about this a dozen times , Holly . " " And it never made me feel any better . " " Well , I 'm not willing to throw everything else away for a fight we ca n't win . The rest of the country is not us . You want to see him take a stand against executing convicted murderers , when seventy percent of voters are for it ? Then you can watch the other side troop right in and rip up tax credits for the working poor , cut back school lunches for kids , slash away at old-growth forests , and , while they 're at it , toss tax breaks to people facing the rough decision of whether to put in a pool or a tennis court at their country house . Shit , I 've always been in this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've got to figure out what matters the most , and how we can help the most . " " Everything matters . Especially what you throw away . " " And would it be better for him not to come ? He 's for it . He should be here and take responsibility . " " Takes a lot of courage to kill a retard whose lawyer was incompetent .... Did he ask you ? " " Yes . " " You know it 's wrong , right ? " " Yes . " She got off the bed . " That 's what makes it worse . " And what New Orleans meant to him now was an airport where she looked at him and said " Do n't lose , " before passing through a metal detector . That had been the end of it . He had not seen her since . Shit , New Orleans . Addis did n't want to go . Especially not after that phone call he had received a month ago fromdamnit , he did n't want to think about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call aside , he told himself . Addis checked the screen . POTUS was flashing .
