<p> Hoping to ignite a renewed sense of unity among women of African descent , hundreds of thousands of black women rallied here for the Million Woman March , an assembly that at once resembled a family gathering , an intense and uncensored call to duty and a huge open-air bazaar . <p> All along the mile-long march site , flowing from the steps of this city 's famed Museum of Art , marchers ignored the raw , damp weather today to pose for pictures with families , hug old friends and pore over the array of items being hawked by the scores of vendors who lined the way . <p> At the same time on the main stage , singers and poets performed and a long line of speakers admonished black women to ignore their differences and unite as one . <p> " From this moment , sister , no longer will you walk by your sister and not acknowledge her existence , " said Asia Coney , one of the two Philadelphia activists who called for the march . <p> The bulk of the marchers seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in part because the speakers ' platform was barely visible from many parts of the assembly . Also , a faulty , low-tech sound system made it difficult for participants to follow the day 's events in other parts of the crowd . <p> But those problems seemed secondary to many of the women who gathered , often with the hope that they would be a party to history . <p> " You can tell this was important for a lot of women because they came without knowing a whole lot about it , " said Johnnie Gettings of Chicago . " I came because I wanted to tune into this . It was a sisterhood thing . " <p> Women flooded into Philadelphia on airplanes , trains , buses , cars and vans , filling hotels and doubling up at the homes of friends for an event that many hoped would rival the Million Man March in Washington in 1995 . Crowd estimates for that march were 400,000 from the U.S. Park Police , who are now forbidden by Congress to make estimates , to more than 800,000 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizer Louis Farrakhan , head of the Nation of Islam . That march is credited by some with sparking a new sense of responsibility and collective purpose in many African American communities . <p> " I love it , " said a smiling Sheryl Bundle , as she looked over the crowd along Benjamin Franklin Parkway . " I 'm so excited to see so many positive sisters . Everybody 's excited . Everybody is friendly . " <p> Other women , however , said they were disappointed with an atmosphere that , in places , more resembled an ordinary street festival than the solemn spiritual awakening that was intended . " I actually felt some animosity out here , " said Veatrice Blue , 19 , who drove from Elizabeth , N.J. , with two friends . " You can sense it from some of the women . It is a look that they give you . " <p> While the event was called for black women , thousands of black men turned out for the march , often escorting their wives , daughters or girlfriends . Also , male @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweatshirts . Men from the Nation of Islam provided a line of security for the speakers . <p> " As far as I am concerned , this day is about family , " said Braheem Jeffcoat , a North Philadelphia resident who came to the march with his wife and 5-year-old daughter . " It is about atonement , trying to reconcile differences , all of the good things that we need to be about as a people . " <p> The Million Woman March was the idea of Coney and Phile Chionesu , grass-roots activists who only recently became well known even here in their home town of Philadelphia . Determined to put together an event that spoke first to the needs of women locked in poor neighborhoods , where they watch too many of their men , children and neighbors fall victim to drugs , crime or prison . <p> In following their vision , the organizers largely excluded mainstream groups , including sororities , which are significant networking groups for black women , and many established civil rights groups . <p> Chionesu called the march " a declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the things that has happened to us that has helped to bring about the confusion and disharmony that we experience with one another . " <p> In the end , however , the march attracted a broad range of participants , including some nationally known entertainers and political figures . Among them were actress Jada Pinkett ; Rep. Maxine Waters ( D-Calif. ) ; singer Faith Evans ; Cora Masters Barry , the wife of D.C. Mayor Marion Barry ; and longtime activist Dorothy Height . <p> Sister Souljah , the rap activist and author , was also there , calling on the women to maintain their commitment and feelings of unity beyond the events of the march . <p> " I hear a lot of people out there today saying , sister , sister , sister , " Sister Souljah said . " But what is the definition of sister ? Some of you . . . are here today , but will be ass-butt naked in a club tomorrow .

City officials pegged the gathering at anywhere from 300,000 to 500,000 people , while speaker after speaker told the crowd that they numbered well over the organizers ' goal of 1 million . <p> Winnie Madikizela-Mandela , former wife of South African President Nelson Mandela , said , " We are countless in unity . " <p> Looking out over the huge crowd , Tynnetta Muhammad , the wife of late Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad , said the fact that such a large gathering was pulled to gether by relatively unknown grass-roots activists will unnerve the nation 's policy makers . <p> " They 're not trembling in the White House . They are actually getting sick , " she said . Before the march , the organizers laid down a 12-point platform that called for a broad range of action , including further investigation of allegations that the CIA played a role in allowing black communities to be flooded with crack cocaine ; the creation of programs to help women make the difficult transition from prison back to their communities ; the establishment of black independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abu-Jamal , the former journalist convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer . <p> " We want justice in this country , " Rep. John Conyers Jr . ( D-Mich. ) said . " That is why the women are marching today . " <p> The organizers ' stated agenda is one that many participants may not have agreed with in a narrow sense , but it is one they embraced in the name of unity . <p> " I do n't know about agreeing with the agenda , " said Rita Wilson , a marcher from Chicago . " But I understand that it reflects the reality of the sisters who put this together . It is good that this was not organized by the mainstream because that does n't work . It does not trickle down . " <p> The day 's events began before sunrise as heavy rains drenched the city and hundreds of women assembled for a prayer service at Penn 's Landing on the city 's waterfront .

By the time the main program began at 9 a.m. , the crowd was swelling into the tens of thousands . <p> The assembly itself was a sometimes chaotic mix , with some enthusiastic participants pressed toward the speakers platform , raising placards and waving red-black-and green flags . Others , however , were detached from the speeches and instead treated the gathering more like a convention . They talked to friends , shopped for souvenirs , sampled food and posed for pictures . <p> Christine Williams , 43 , a medical records technician from Philadelphia , stood in the middle of the street and watched the crowd . She was dissatisfied . " I do n't feel that warmth from the other sisters , " she said . " I saw that warmth at the Million Man March , and I watched it on television .

She was not even facing the platform , but she was soaking the event up nonetheless . " I ca n't understand a thing , " she said , complaining about the poor sound system . " It 's not clear . But I do n't need to hear it . I 'm just proud to be here . " <p> Edith Cherry , 48 , a nurse 's aide from Newark said , " I 'm here because I 'm a black mother and I 'm a black grandmother . This is history . It 's beautiful to see black women come together . We 've got to unite and this is a start . " <p> Many speakers urged participants not to allow the march to become a one-day , feel-good event . Instead , they implored , women should return to their communities and begin to work together . <p> @ @ @
