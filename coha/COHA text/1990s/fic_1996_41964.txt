IT INTERESTS ME , the variations in flow and rhythm that conspire to make change . I used to picture the changes of seasons and events as the result of some incremental movement at earth 's center : some perceptible straining against tension until the gearing of a cogwheel moved forward one click . And there are times when I still hold that opinion-the somewhat mechanized , simplified view , which makes it a little easier for us to believe things are under control . But more and more now I find myself wondering also if it-change-is more fluid than we can ever realize : that it is more fluid than even a river or the windthat it is fluid and erratic , like some invisible animal that moves gracefully through the world for a while , then lies down to nap or rest , then gets up to feed and begins moving again-pacing and prowling through its home territory , home ground-its place . <p> I 'm not sure when the harvest starts , up here ; when the lightheartedness of summer ends and the hurry-up sweetness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold these compartments in our minds , sectioning the months into halves , the first and fifteenth of each , and the seasons into quarters , like fruit , by solstice . <p> We had huge thunder- and rainstorms last night , and today , the eleventh of August , did not in any way seem to me to be either a significant gear-tooth of change nor even have to it the feel of the motion of an animal or invisible thing getting up and moving from one place to another : but that is what happened . <p> I did my work in the morning , oblivious . It was a cold morning , after the front blew through , damp and foggy ; I had a fire in the woodstove at dawn , but still it seemed no different from the day before , or the day before that . The coyotes had been crying all morning , even into midday , crying loud-so much so that I marked it down in my journalbut I had assumed it was for a reason that could be understood or explained or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the storms and had not been able to go hunting . It was an exotic sound , their carrying on in the middle of the day like that . I should have pondered it , should have paused and paid attention , but I just kept on working . <p> Later in the day I had to drive up to the pay phone to make some calls . The generator 's been down for a month-no one can figure out why , not even the factory reps-and the backup is broken , too , now . Because it 's late summer , the solar panel 's able to provide the energy we need ; we pump water into the holding tanks on sunny days , and at night read by gas lantern or flashlight . It 's no big deal , really , but I was letting it get to me , anyway . It was starting to bother me-going into the second month of no one being able to fix it-and as I drove toward town , down the winding road through sun and shadow , and across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much all that was in my head . <p> I was already seated on the stump at the pay phone , punching in my first call , when Grandma Helen came up and gave me a hug and told me that Gail , the owner of the mercantile , had died that morning : she 'd had a massive heart attack , seemingly from out of nowhere . I put the phone down and said what everyone else had been saying , and would keep saying , through the day : slowly- " Unbelievable . I ca n't believe it . " <p> She had smoked like a chimney , but had n't been that old-fiftyeight . She still had all her energy and vigor ; too much so , on some days , truth be told-if she did n't agree with something , she 'd let you know real quick . She 'd tell you how the cow ate cabbage . <p> Now I could feel it-the stillness over the town . The mercantile 's the fulcrum of the valley : the place people come to hang out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a VCR movie in winter 's stillness , or drink a beer , or put a message on the bulletin board-the weight and birthdate of Sue Jantzen 's or Lisa Mountain 's baby , or the date of a bake sale , or anything-and Gail had been the one who ran this center-station . None of us up here likes cities or crowds , but we liked the mercantile , and we liked and loved Gail . She , and the merc , were all of town we could take : the outer limits . <p> Now I knew why the coyotes had been singing and carrying on all day . I did n't know what they were saying , but I knew they knew . <p> Later in the afternoon , I took my three-year-old daughter , Mary Katherine , and my two old hounds , Homer and Ann , up onto the mountain to pick huckleberries . It was that time of year , suddenly upon us , as it always is : some shifting fault-line or fracture between summer and fall . It 's the first year she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and after an initial period of eating every berry she pickedboth of us stained purple-we settled into a bucket-filling rhythm . It was a little alarming to see how easily , how naturally , she fell into the pattern of acquisition , of hunting and gathering , laying in store for winter : how much it pleased her for the bucket to be filling . We are born with the capacity to look ahead and plan for the future ; I believe it is in us . I believe we do know how to look beyond the moment . <p> And so for most of the afternoon , crouched among waist-high bushes , we picked berries-picking the biggest , juiciest ones . The incredible simplicity of the act : the simple pleasure of the entranced rhythm-hunt , seek , gather ; the simple , simple despair , say , at dropping a big berry , having picked one but then lost it in the transfer from bush to bucket , clumsy-handed . <p> The sun slipped lower , the late-summer light grew softer , and that 's all there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sound of berries going in the buckets , and the rustling of the dogs behind us , browsing the berries straight from the bush , their muzzles purpled . <p> Driving home , we saw another young coyote , smoke gray with a black tip for a tail , trotting boldly through a fresh-cut , summer-green hayfield . The sun was lowering , the light turning that brief bronze that happens for a while , late in the day , and yet the field was luminous and green , fresh from all the summer 's rains . It 's been a good lush year . Some of the hay had been cut , but there was an island of it in the center of the green field that had not been cut but was tall and wind-wavingand when the coyote saw that we were watching , it headed for that island of tall grass and disappeared into it , just disappeared . <p> We stopped off at the mailbox . Nothing much : catalogs and flyers and such . I was thinking how if she had hung in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had n't even been sick ! ) she might have been able to see that coyote in the sun field , less than a mile from her store . <p> Turning , we saw a doe standing in the center of the road with a big , spotted fawn nursing , tucked in under her hip . The fawn was nursing hard , sometimes butting its mother with such force that it shifted the doe 's hindquarters around at nearly a right angle , and the doe would reposition herself , all the while watching us carefully . We had stopped the truck and were just looking , not wanting to disturb anything . We watched for almost twenty minutes . The fawn did n't dream there was a thing in the world beyond milk . And it seemed that the doe understood we would let the fawn finish : we were in no hurry . Finally the fawn looked up and saw us , and it bolted , frightened , into the woods . The doe flagged her tail and trotted off in the other direction . The fawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We started the engine again and drove on home . <p> There was still some light left . There was something different in the air-Gail had alerted us all to it , but I could feel it , now-and it reminded me that I needed to get the woodshed built , to keep the snow off the firewood . I had been thinking about it for a while , and had set out buckets to gather rainwater with which to mix the concrete for when I would pour the pads , the pillars , which would hold the bottom course of logs off the ground and keep them from rotting . <p> Mary Katherine and I went up into the woods and dug holes for the sonnotubes-the shells or molds into which we would pour the concrete . We measured and spaced them , leveled them . She pretended to take measurements with the builder 's square and the level and called out numbers to me in the dusk : " One , seven , thirteen , eight , one hundred . " <p> We mixed the bags of concrete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it into the tubes . Carved our initials into the wet cement , after smoothing it with a trowel . A light rain was beginning to fall-a mist , as dusk went into darkness . We could barely see , but I wanted to get them all done at once , to harden evenly . After a while it was past Mary Katherine 's bedtime , but we kept working , the way you sometimes do : not to meet any deadline , but because you are loving the work-if it can be called that . I kept asking if Mary Katherine wanted to go inside , but she said no , said please no . We were damp from the rain , but it was a warm rain and we were warm from working . By the time we were on the last pier , she knew when the concrete was too rough and when it needed another shot of water . She would pour while I stirred . <p> She leaned in against my shoulder , watching me pour cement down the tube . She kept falling asleep standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in when we were through , and she woke up and changed into dry pajamas , and I showered . <p> We got under the covers and I read to her , as we do every nightthis time , an old book about Theodore Turtle . It was a feeling like having gathered berries or firewood-having filled the day so full , full to the brim . It was still raining outside-a steady rain , now , and cooler , but warm inside . Mary Katherine was proud of how much help she 'd been and anxious to do more work tomorrow . She wanted to know what our chores would entail the next day . <p> I had already measured and cut and drilled the bottom course of logs . There was a pile of sawdust where I had been working , so I told her that tomorrow we would pick up that sawdust , and maybe also , if there was time , climb a tree . I told her it would be another sunny day and that we might pick more berries , too . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn , and in the autumn , all the things that needed to be gathered , but she had already fallen asleep after I 'd told her about the sawdust and climbing a tree . She was smiling , and I know that those two things were more than enough . <p> Gail had had the store up for sale . She had said it was bad for her heart : the stress of running it . <p> I used to marvel at how many hours she put in , just sitting there , waiting to provide us with whatever we needed , whatever we desired . She liked hunting season best , I think , when all the hunters came through , though she was fond of summer , too . It was a damn good day , and she had missed it , as we missed her-and the seasons kept moving on , and us in the world , as if riding on the back of something . <p>
