<p> What 's " real " ? According to America 's No. 2 tobacco company , R.J. Reynolds , its new Winston is the real real thing . The company has removed the hundreds of additives from its flagging Winston brand and kicked off a national marketing campaign stressing that the product is " real , " " naked , " with " true taste " and " No Bull . " <p> Gone are the flavorings , the sugar , the propylene glycol and all of the other ingredients that the company estimates make up some 6 percent of competing brands by weight . New ads feature punchy lines such as : " Until I find a real man , I 'll settle for a real smoke " and " I get enough bull at work . I do n't need to smoke it . " <p> Anti-tobacco activists say the new product image is , well , bull . Matthew L. Myers of the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids said the campaign was " designed to make consumers believe that Winston has been improved , made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His group has attacked what it calls the " absurd and deceptive campaign " and said it could lead minors who are thinking of taking up the habit into believing that Winstons will not harm them . He compared it to the sexy campaign the company has brought out to replace its much-maligned Joe Camel . <p> " We applauded when they announced the death of Joe Camel , but obviously the company 's intentions have not changed , " said Bill Novelli , the group 's president , in a statement . <p> The American Heart Association , the American Lung Association and the American Cancer Society have asked the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the new campaign . <p> RJR , however , is n't talking about health . " We are , of course , making absolutely no claims about the health consequences about this cigarette versus any other cigarette , " said Edmund C. " Ned " Leary , RJR vice president for Winston marketing . <p> Whenever tobacco companies have made explicit health claims for cigarettes  --  for instance , that they help smokers lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regulate the products . Until that agency 's recent initiative to regulate tobacco products to curb youth smoking , only health claims could trigger such scrutiny . Thus RJR did not trumpet the possible health benefits of its Eclipse cigarette , which is being test marketed in Chattanooga , Tenn. , even though the company had commissioned a number of tests showing that the cigarette emitted far lower levels of the most common carcinogens in normal brands . ( The brand 's risk for heart disease , however , is unknown . ) <p> Instead , the new Winston campaign attempts to combine its additive-free distinction with what Leary calls an " attitude " in ads that would establish Winston as a brand that stands for " what you see is what you get , rejecting artificiality . " Leary said it fits in with a national mania for authenticity : " Everybody wears bluejeans , 100 percent cotton is good ; 100 percent leather is selling well . We think people want products that are authentic . " <p> That does not mean the product is pesticide-free , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tobacco has entered its doors . And that also does not mean that all the smoker gets is tobacco leaf ; the processes that create filler from tobacco byproducts are also used in the new Winston , Leary said  --  but only those processes that use water or carbon dioxide , not the more complex processes . <p> Like the all-tobacco brands that have achieved popularity in England and Canada , the new Winston gets around the need for flavorings by blending with an emphasis on mild , flue-cured tobaccos , which are high in natural sugar , over the harsher , nicotine-rich burley and oriental tobaccos that figure prominently in other brands . <p> The issue of tobacco additives has long been a target of activists . The companies , citing trade secrets , have been loath to reveal full details of the hundreds of compounds that are added to cigarettes , from flavorings such as licorice and chocolate to ammonia compounds . A Massachusetts court last week upheld a new state law that will force tobacco companies to reveal all additives by December . The increasing popularity of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the concept of " pure " cigarettes . <p> This is not the first time RJR has tried to launch an additives-free brand . It marketed a product named " Real " between 1977 and 1980 . RJR spokeswoman Peggy Carter said Real was discontinued at the same time as four other brands that " clearly were not amassing the share goals we would have wanted , " and she called it " a product whose time had not yet come . " <p> Industry analyst Gary Black of Sanford Bernstein &; Co. said the new campaign is promising for Winston , which has seen its market share slide by 8 percent annually in recent years . During a yearlong test market in Florida , the brand held its own against competitors , and the company took that as a sign that the " real " image could help arrest Winston 's slide . <p> Black , who said he is usually critical of RJR 's marketing efforts , said , " I actually think it 's going to work " nationwide . Smokers do n't care about additives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image the brand is acquiring through the campaign . <p> " What you 're really trying to do is send a message that ' people who smoke Winstons are real people . . . . What you see is what you get , ' " Black explained . The only drawback , he said , was that the current population of Winston smokers , estimated to number 2.7 million , might rebel , triggering the kind of marketing quandary that several years ago forced the Coca-Cola Co. to reintroduce its original soda giant as " Classic Coke " after trying to reformulate the product . <p> Black said the new Winston has much greater potential for profitability than the company 's Eclipse , which he said is languishing in test markets because the novel cigarette , which heats tobacco but does not burn it , is somewhat difficult to smoke . <p> An expert in advertising said the Winston campaign is a big risk for RJR because the ads could end up delivering a message that other products are more dangerous by comparison  --  even its own brands . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Richard Pollay , of the University of British Columbia . Pollay , who testifies on behalf of plaintiffs in tobacco litigation , said , " People are inclined toward the belief that if things are natural or organic and real as opposed to ersatz and synthetic and phony , they might be healthier "  --  a notion he called " a bit specious " in light of the health risks of tobacco . <p> Internal industry documents show that the company had thought about such issues in the past . One legal memorandum held by the Liggett Group , released as part of Florida 's lawsuit against the industry , discussed the impact of additives on litigation . The October 1986 memo said , " To the uninitiated , a list of the ingredients used in cigarettes will be surprising , intimidating and possibly frightening . " <p> Still , the memo concluded , " toxicologists consulted to date agree that ingredients do not increase the health risk of smoking cigarettes . " The bad news for the company , however , was that " the test data upon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the same conclusion with respect to tobacco . If the consultants used to date are any guide , it seems unlikely that we will be able to locate a toxicologist who will give a ' clean ' opinion to tobacco , even if ( s ) he agrees that ingredients pose no risk . The more realistic hope is that we can get an opinion that tobacco is a ' risk factor . ' " <p> RJR spokeswoman Carter stressed that the memo was purely used in preparation for litigation and had nothing to do with product development , and that " they found no evidence " of harm from additives . <p> But anti-tobacco activist Myers said the RJR document belies the health implications of the company 's " No Bull " campaign . " Years ago , RJR recognized that the number one killer is n't the additives  --  it 's the tobacco itself , " he said . " If anything , the campaign ought to be , ' All of the cancer and none of the taste . ' "
