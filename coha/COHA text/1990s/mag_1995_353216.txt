Why ca n't a movie be more like a woman ? How is it that Hollywood films are usually built like Arnold Schwarzenegger  --  big and burly , with way more muscle power than is needed ? Much rarer is the notion that a film can address the subtleties of emotion , that it can have curve and contour , beauty and heart . In the ' 90s , alas , the Oscar category of Best Actress has become a chic , sparse ghetto . It 's hard to find five films in which women have exciting , dominant roles . <P> So there was little surprise last week when the Academy Award went to Jessica Lange for her role as a blowsy Army wife in Blue Sky  --  a film made four years ago , shelved when its distributor went bankrupt , then released last year to a paltry $2.4 million box-office take . The award was a tribute not just to Lange , a six-time nominee and a winner as Supporting Actress in 1983 for Tootsie , but to the endangered species of women 's movies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than for men , across the board , " says Lange , 45 , who scooted back to her farm in central Virginia the day after her triumph . " Good scripts are as rare as hen 's teeth . " And for actresses in their 40s , she notes , " the opportunities are thinning out even more . " <P> To see what she has made of her opportunities , visit a theater near you . Nearly 20 years after fighting off a big gorilla 's advances in King Kong , Lange is a one-woman cottage industry . The Oscar win has brought Blue Sky back into limited release , prior to an April 18 debut in video stores . In Losing Isaiah , she stars as an adoptive mother in a custody battle . And beginning this Friday she can be seen in Rob Roy , Michael Caton-Jones ' epic of a legendary Scotsman ( Liam Neeson ) and the woman who shared his pain and cheered him on . <P> There 's not a lot for audiences to cheer about in Rob Roy ; it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lange was attracted to Alan Sharp 's script ( " an amazingly beautiful piece of writing " ) , which contains some sonorous orations and choice epithets . Lange brings that signal gift , sexual intelligence , to the role of Mary MacGregor ; the light in her eyes catches fire when she stares at Neeson . But Mary is not part of the film 's main conflict , between Neeson and villain Tim Roth . Despite Lange 's efforts , Mary is a mature version of that macho-movie ornament , the Girl  --  victim , inspiration , trophy . <P> The trophy in Losing Isaiah , written by Naomi Foner and directed by Stephen Gyllenhaal , is a black child whose drug-addict mother ( Halle Berry ) dumped him in a garbage can shortly after his birth . Now he is two-and the point of contention in a tug-of-love between the mother and the family that raised him . Isaiah plays as a court case , with evidence and arguments for each side . But in movie terms , the case is stacked against Lange : next to Berry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of those dares a maturing female star likes to take : stripping off her glamour to reveal bone , sinew , despair .
