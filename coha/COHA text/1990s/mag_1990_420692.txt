J.R . Ewing as Sanford &; Son : how junkman John Cassidy is cleaning up on used oilfield equipment he bought for peanuts . <p> FOR A LESSON in good timing , crafty strategy and the virtues f no debt , go no further than John Cassidy Jr. , a craggy-faced good old boy from Frederick , Okla . Cassidy has spent the past decade prowling around oilfield equipment auctions from Louisiana to Calgary , mercilessly picking the bones of the once mighty American drilling industry , <p> For less than 10 cents on the dollar of original cost , he rightfully claims to have amassed the world 's biggest private collection of used drilling machinery . The value of his investment : about $50 million . Every dime of that is his own . <p> It is one of the biggest and boldest , and perhaps one of the shrewdest , one-man gambles that the oil industry has seen in many a year . Admits Cassidy : " You could not do this if you had a boss , a banker or a wife . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 160-acre spread of derricks , motors , pumps , winches and drill pipe over a one-half-mile-square patch of rolling farmland halfway between Tulsa and Oklahoma City . As you weave through row after row of massive machinery  --  enough major component parts to equip more than 150 oil rigs  --  you get the feeling of being in the middle of a great armored division about to go into battle . <p> And if oil prices stay above $30 a barrel or the shooting starts in the Persian Gulf , much of this iron ( pronounced ARN ) will go marching back to work to find oil ( pronounced ALL ) . <p> Even if half of this aging collection of castoffs ends up being sold as scrap , claims Cassidy , his trove should be worth at least three times what he 's got invested in it . <p> And though he 's now 66 and looking to cash out one of these days , Cassidy 's not too eager to be an aggressive seller just yet . The reason : dwindling stocks of replacement hardware in the drilling business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sharp rise in the value of good used equipment . That was true even before the Iraqis invaded Kuwait . <p> Cassidy thinks the best is yet to come . Despite the turmoil in the Mideast and a doubling of oil prices in recent months , the number of rigs drilling in the U.S. has remained stuck at around 1,000  --  a quarter of its early 1980s peak . <p> What 's holding it back ? Mainly a shortage of skilled labor and good drill pipe . But there 's also a worsening shortage of all kinds of hardware and machinery  --  precisely the kind of gear that Cassidy sells . Any increase in the number of oil rigs that would be put back to work will send prices surging , he says . <p> Take for instance your basic 750-hp D-398 Caterpillar diesel engine . A typical oil rig would use three or four of these babies . New , they 'd have cost about $90,000 during the oil boom . Two years ago Cassidy was buying them at auction for as low as $8,000 . Today good used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger Cat D-399 that went at the auctions a few years ago for $17,000 now fetches $50,000  --  not a bad markup . Need a couple hundred engines ? Call Cassidy . <p> Of course , it 's strictly " buyer beware , " warns Bry McClellan , an electrician with driller Helmerich &; Payne who happened to be rummaging around Cassidy 's lot for 30 big electric motors one afternoon . " It 's like buying a used car , " McClellan says with a smile . <p> But , for the list price of one new engine , you could still buy two from Cassidy and throw away the one that does n't work . McClellan wound up buying 20 of Cassidy 's motors to equip H &P's; rigs . <p> Cassidy 's biggest recent windfall : late-model self-elevating derricks , 2 of which he just sold to an Indian drilling company for $125,000 each . He paid less than $5,000 apiece . He 's sold a total of 7 since 1986 , and has 18 left . Get ' em while they last : The price tag for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may be foolish . But if I 've made any mistake , it was not buying enough back in 1986 , " Cassidy points out . " I lose more money selling too quick , too cheap , than I do buying too high . " <p> Whether smart or just lucky , Cassidy has certainly had a knack for making money . He sold his own drilling company at the peak of the oil boom in 1981 for a rumored $13 million . " Even at the peak , I could make more money on interest than from running my rigs , " says Cassidy . " And the caliber of the people spending money was suspect . " <p> In fact , he 's been in and out of the drilling business three times , selling out the first time in the 1950s and resuming his work as a petroleum engineer . He got back in the late 1960s by buying up small well-service rigs being disposed of by the major oil companies , setting up his used equipment business on the side to get rid of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1984 Cassidy began buying used hardware in earnest , doubling his inventory every year from what had been the equivalent of less than 10 rigs to more than 150 now . He had eight trucks hauling in used equipment from all over the country ; he says he often paid more to move the stuff than he paid to buy it . <p> Now those trucks are parked , as the buying has tapered off . The auctions are fewer , leaner and a lot pricier . But Cassidy is still a net buyer . He says he picked up 11 used production oil well pumping units one day for $32,000 , and immediately resold one of them for $20,000 . <p> Cassidy has held to a firm financial rule : He has kept at least a third of the proceeds from his drilling company sale in Treasury securities and bought only what he could afford with the rest , plus income from hardware sales and a modest revenue from his 60 stripper wells . <p> He eschews debt . " It has such a depressive effect on you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose a little money on a third of what he 's bought and break even on another third . Then he 'll clean up on the last third . <p> Cassidy is not merely betting on higher oil prices . He has also been right on the money in betting the U.S. dollar is going to keep on losing its value because of persistent budget and trade deficits . That translates into firming prices for his scrap metal  --  and eager foreign demand for his equipment . <p> This time around , he 's hoping to match the killing he made in the early 1970s , when he bought an entire trainload of surplus oilfield hardware in Canada for $500,000 . " Come the boom , they tried to buy it all back , " he crows , claiming he made huge windfall profits on three-quarters of what he bought . " It was the best deal I ever made . " <p> The worst was probably in 1985 , when he bought two massive inland drilling barges for $300,000 altogether . Each was fully equipped and able to sleep a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hookups , he found nobody would hire . them because they lacked proper pollution controls . Cassidy let them be scrapped for only the hardware he could salvage . <p> Says the junkman philosophically : " If you do n't make some bad deals , you 're not doing enough deals .
