( The play opens with trilling sounds of flutes . In the dim light the trunks seem lumpy and mysterious . Spot slowly rises on Dragons . ) DIMSKY Far away and well beyond . . . . DIMSKY Beyond what ? DIMSKY Just beyond , OK ? Do n't interrupt . Far away and well beyond there lies the principality of . . . Zhar . DIMSKY That 's where we are , right ? DIMSKY Do you want to tell this ? DIMSKY No . Just make sure you tell them where Zhar is . Far away and well beyond does n't do it for me . DIMSKY Well . Let 's see . . . Zhar is somewhere between Minsk and Pinsk , a little to the left of Kiev , a little south of . . . Oh , this is ridiculous ! You 'll know you 're in Zhar when you see a flash of red in the brush , a glowing wing , a feathery heap of fire . ( A heap of scarlet feathers is spotted centre stage . As RIMSKY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfolds , revealing itself to be a bird , and does a preening and joyous dance . As it dances , its feathers seem to glow like fire. ) p. 3 DIMSKY Firebird  --  Bird of the Sun . Only in Zhar does Firebird still dance . In more than a thousand years no one has ever captured or hurt this splendid creature . And indeed , it is written somewhere . . . DIMSKY What do you mean , somewhere ? It 's right here in our computer banks . DIMSKY It was fed into our computer banks by the wise ones of old . . . TOGETHER " As long as Firebird is free , the Principality of Zhar shall flourish . " DIMSKY So you see , no one has even tried to capture it . That is , till now . . . ( FIREBIRD , alarmed , runs off . ) ( During RIMSKY 's speech IRENKA enters .

DIMSKY I 'm not going to introduce her . You do it . DIMSKY Oh , if I must . Lady Irenka . One of Zhar 's national treasures . p. 4 IRENKA And ? Go on ! DIMSKY ( Sighs . He 's said this many times before . ) Irenka is as white as lilies and as red as roses and every man in the kingdom is madly in love with her . Every day at least ten men of wealth and power make offers of marriage , but she never says yes because none of them is ever good enough . ( Behind IRENKA , IVAN has entered , weighed down with gifts , among them a small casket and some ornate loaves of bread . He sets the packages down and slips his hands over IRENKA 's eyes . ) PRINCE IVAN There is one , however , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandrovich . PRINCE IVAN Uh uh . IRENKA Could it be . . . Count Milovan ? PRINCE IVAN No ! I 'll give you a hint . He 's bold , brave , a devil with a sword , not bad looking . IRENKA Ah ! I know . It 's Koshchei ! PRINCE IVAN Koshchei ! Koshchei ? IRENKA Calm down ! I was only teasing . PRINCE IVAN He 's been around again , has n't he . p. 5 IRENKA I have n't seen Koshchei in weeks . Not since our engagement was announced . PRINCE IVAN So he knows you 're going to marry me . You have actually refused him . IRENKA I always refuse him . I do n't want to marry Koshchei . I 'd sooner marry a bulldozer . PRINCE IVAN But you told him you were marrying me ? IRENKA Three weeks ago . PRINCE IVAN Hmm . Well I do n't think he 's going to give you up that easily . IRENKA Give me up ! He does n't own me . PRINCE IVAN I think he and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will definitely come to blows . IRENKA The wedding 's only three days away . If he was going to make a fuss , he 'd have done it by now . PRINCE IVAN Three days is plenty of time to make a fuss . IRENKA Oh ! Quit worrying about it . I can handle Koshchei . Ooooh . ( Spotting presents ) What 's all this ? PRINCE IVAN A few wedding presents . ( Pretends to keep them from her. ) p. 6 IRENKA Well let 's open them . ( Circumventing IVAN she picks up a package and reads the card . ) " Best wishes , Uncle Vasily and Auntie Elenia . " ( Rips open parcel ) A tablecloth ! how boring ! PRINCE IVAN Looks like she embroidered it herself . IRENKA I know ! ( Picks up an elaborately twisted loaf of bread from the pile that IVAN carried in ) And all this bread ! PRINCE IVAN From the people of Zhar . A traditional gift . IRENKA Quaint . PRINCE IVAN Of course there will be plenty of other things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But bread is traditional . You know that . IRENKA Traditions are boring . ( Spotting the casket ) What 's in there ? PRINCE IVAN ( Teasing . Keeping it from her . ) A present from me . ( She wangles it from him and opens it eagerly . It 's full of jewels . She loses interest . ) PRINCE IVAN They do n't please you ? I ransomed half the kingdom to get these . p. 7 IRENKA They 're fine , really they are . The truth is , Ivan , I already have more jewels than anyone could possibly wear . PRINCE IVAN I knew that . I should have got something else . What would you like ? You have only to name it . IRENKA I do n't know . I have everything it 's possible to have . PRINCE IVAN Anyone as beautiful as you deserves to have everything . IRENKA If you knew how boring it is to have everything .

DIMSKY ( His wail matches the wobble of the trunk and rises with it climactically . ) Ohhhhh . Ohhhhh . Ohhhhh . Ohhh ! ( The trunk opens with a bang and the rotund , brightly arrayed figure of BABA YAGA tumbles out . ) BABA YOGA Oshki Petroshki ! I 've got to stop traveling this way ! It 's expected of course . Impresses the socks off everyone . But I 'm going to break something one of these days . ( Rubs her behind ) And I do n't mean the speed record . p. 8 IRENKA Who 's this ? Your Auntie Elenia ? ( IRENKA laughs . IVAN tries not to . ) PRINCE IVAN Shhh ! It 's the Baba . IRENKA The who ? PRINCE IVAN Baba Yaga . She used to be one of the court advisers . I have n't seen her in years . BABA YOGA There you are . I have something to tell you young man . Now let me see . . . . why am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea , Baba . Or some wedding cake . BABA YOGA I 'm not here for a tea party ! I have important information to reveal . Just let me get my breath . ( They look at each other and make fun of her silently . ) BABA YOGA Do n't fidget . Ohh ! ( Holds her head as though she 's witnessing something dreadful . ) Oh yes ! It was a dream I had . Ooohhh ! I 've come to tell you my dream . IRENKA I think I 'll take a tour of the garden . PRINCE IVAN No . ( Getting serious ) We must listen . The Baba 's dreams are always listened to . It 's a Royal tradition . p. 9 BABA YOGA I 'm glad to see you still have some manners left , Ivan . My dream is terrible  --  too terrible to tell really  --  but when a wise woman knows the worst she ca n't keep it to herself . IRENKA ( Under her breath ) Get on with it . BABA YOGA I dreamt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captured Firebird , Baba . BABA YOGA In my dream Firebird was captured . By Koshchei the Deathless . PRINCE IVAN Koshchei ! He could n't catch a cold ! BABA YOGA I dreamt that you tried to stop him , Ivan . ( The rest of her speech is muffled in tears ) PRINCE IVAN And ? Come on , you can tell us . BABA YOGA He killed you . PRINCE IVAN Koshchei killed me ? Ridiculous ! BABA YOGA You ca n't treat Koshchei as just another rival , Ivan . He is a force , a power . A magician of great strength . PRINCE IVAN A magician ? That 's news to me. p. 10 BABA YOGA Koshchei 's been biding his time , waiting his chance . He 's come forward now because the country is in trouble . The morale of the people is low , the government weakened by bad management and extravagance , the . . . PRINCE IVAN This sounds like nagging to me . BABA YOGA I 'm here to warn you , Ivan . Koshchei is n't any ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this earth can kill him . PRINCE IVAN Everyone can be killed . BABA YOGA Not Koshchei . His death is hidden where no man can find it . If you try to fight him you 'll meet a quick and brutal end . And when he 's finished with you he 'll chop your body into a thousand pieces and scatter them on the endless steppes . IRENKA ( Shivering a little ) A fine tale for a wedding . BABA YOGA Have we met ? PRINCE IVAN Baba . Allow me to present Lady Irenka . BABA YOGA Irenka . So you 're the one he 's making all the fuss about . PRINCE IVAN Irenka is about to become my . . . BABA YOGA Yes . Yes . I know what she 's about to become . Do you know what this fool has done in your name , my fine lady ? Rivers damned up , forests cut down . Do you have any idea of the destruction ? He 's turned the country into a wasteland for a box of trinkets . Look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toe ) This would buy bread for everyone in Zhar for fifty years . p. 11 PRINCE IVAN What is bread next to the beauty of Irenka ? BABA YOGA You are burdened with illusions , Ivan . You believe that the problems of the world have nothing to do with you . PRINCE IVAN Well there are so many problems . What could I do that would make a difference ? BABA YOGA You also have this childish notion that you deserve only the best . PRINCE IVAN Only the best is worth having . ( He looks at Irenka when he says this . They join hands . ) BABA YOGA And that beauty is it 's own reward . PRINCE IVAN Beauty is the only reward . BABA YOGA Yes such beauty . ( She strokes IRENKA 's face ) If Firebird is captured , it wo n't be worth a pinch of dandelion fluff . This lovely skin will turn as rough as leather . IRENKA What are you talking about ! BABA YOGA It was in my dream . This silky hair will turn gray and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will you still love me , Ivan , when I 'm wrinkled and leathery ? ( IVAN , as an answer , kisses her fingers. ) p. 12 BABA YOGA Those fine fingers of yours will turn hard and yellow . ( IRENKA pulls her hand away ) BABA YOGA Your lips will curl back and your tongue will lengthen and your ears will turn pointy and furry . IRENKA ( Laughs uncertainly ) Sounds like a lap dog . BABA YOGA Nothing so pretty . You will become a wolfish creature , skulking in the shadows . PRINCE IVAN Get away from here , hag ! IRENKA Why would this happen to me ? PRINCE IVAN Do n't listen to her . BABA YOGA Because you are the reason that Firebird will be captured . IRENKA Firebird captured ! I would never do such a thing . BABA YOGA ( Plucks the feather from IRENKA 's belt ) You will do it in ignorance but you will do it nevertheless . You will bring about the imprisonment of Firebird . PRINCE IVAN It 's time you were gone , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Take it easy ! p. 13 PRINCE IVAN ( He escorts BABA off ) Next time you have a foolish tale to tell , do n't bring it here . BABA YOGA In the old days Baba 's dreams were taken seriously . IRENKA Maybe there 's something to what she says . ( BABA and IVAN exit and she calls after them . ) Ivan ! Wait ! BABA YOGA I warn you . Dire things will happen ! ( Ground shaking noise ) ( KOSHCHEI stomps in , in a flurry of laser lights , flashing swords etc.  --  an impressive hulk in black armor ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Irenka ! Irenka ! IRENKA Stop shouting ! I 'm right here . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Just as prickly as ever , I see . I like lippy women . IRENKA Look I 'm not in the mood for small talk . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Small talk ? Hey , I 'm here on serious business . IRENKA Would you mind if I did n't listen right now . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I 'm ready to take the plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll do it right away . I guess you 'll want new clothes , a honey moon . That 's okay . I can afford it . I can afford the best . p. 14 IRENKA I do n't want to hear this . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS You do n't know what you 're saying ! IRENKA Yes I do . I 'm saying , " No ! " KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS No one says " No ! " to me ! I 'm Koshchei the Deathless ! Ruler of the dark ! Victor of every battlefield ! Koshchei the invincible ! I could smash you to smithereens with one little tap of my hand ! IRENKA I wo n't say I 'm not grateful . It 's just that I 'm already engaged . I 'm marrying Prince Ivan in three days time . Did n't I tell you this before ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Ivan ! That pin head ! IRENKA You 're lucky Ivan is n't here . He 'd soon cut you down to size . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Ivan ! Ivan ! Are we talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stand up to one Koshchei . IRENKA Ivan could finish off three Koschei 's before breakfast ! KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Is that so ! I 'll tell you Irenka , if Ivan is all that stands between us then Ivan is n't worth a little puff of sand . I 'll cut his body into a thousand pieces and scatter them on the endless steppes ! p. 15 IRENKA What did you say ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I 'll cut his body into a thousand pieces and scatter them on the endless steppes ! IRENKA Those were the Baba 's very words . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS And do n't think I would n't do it . I am Koshchei the Deathless . Do you know what that means ? ( Light gets dark and ominous . ) IRENKA It means no one can kill you . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Right ! No one can kill me because my death is n't in my body . It 's hidden away where no one can ever find it . And if they ca n't find it they ca n't kill me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Koshchei ? ( Flirting ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS That 's for me to know and you to find out . And you 'd have a lot better chance of finding out if you were Mrs. Koshchei . IRENKA ( Drawing back ) I do n't want to find out that much . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Oh yes you do ! ( His hand reaches out in a threatening way . The ominous light deepens. ) p. 16 IRENKA Give me a minute . I want to think this through . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I do n't go for a lot of thinking in a woman . ( He twists his hand and the darkness deepens . IRENKA is surrounded by strange and uneasy sounds . ) IRENKA Yes ! All right . I 'll marry you . But . . . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS But ? . . . But ! ! IRENKA ( Gathering courage against the threatening effects of his magic ) If you are as powerful as you say , you wo n't mind if I assign you an impossible task ? It 's the custom , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two for his girl . That way she knows she 's really worth something in his eyes . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS If it 's impossible , how am I supposed to do it ? IRENKA Well , if you 're afraid . . . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Afraid ! I am Koshchei the Deathless . Ruler of the dark . Victor of . . . IRENKA I know . I know ! KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Tell me what you want me to do . IRENKA Well this task I 'm about to give you must be completed in three days . p. 17 KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS No sweat . IRENKA And if you do n't complete it in three days . That 's by ( consults watch ) four o'clock three days from now . . . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I said , no sweat , did n't I ? I 'm going to complete it . IRENKA But if you do n't . Then you must promise to leave me in peace and let me marry Ivan . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS ( Shouting and stomping amid even more threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! No ! No ! No ! NO ! IRENKA Then the deal 's off . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS All right . All right . I 'm going to complete the task anyway so there 's no problem . IRENKA But I have your word ? ( Chanting the words like a children 's game she raps him smartly on either shoulder and bonks him on the forehead . ) Stampsies , acies , no erasies ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS ( Knocked off balance ) You have my word . IRENKA ( Aside ) Good going , Irenka . All it takes is a little brain work . p. 18 KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS So . What do I have to do ? ( The storm of light and sound is still going on and IRENKA looks at him crossly ) IRENKA Do you mind . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Uh . Oh . Yeah . ( He restores normalcy with a snap of his fingers ) So , go ahead . IRENKA The task is that , in three days time , you must bring me three things in the world that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't need three days to do that . I 'll bring you peacocks from India . IRENKA I have dozens of peacocks . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS A trunk full of rubies and diamonds . ( IRENKA opens the trunk Ivan gave her . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS A matched set of Arabian ponies . IRENKA I have a stable full of Arabian ponies . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Fur coats ? ( IRENKA shakes her head ) Ferraris ? Perfume . IRENKA I have all the perfumes of the Orient . And of the Occident . p. 19 KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Silk dresses . IRENKA I have dresses of every material known to man . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Do n't worry . I 'll think of something . ( Stomps off ) IRENKA I doubt it . ( IVAN enters ) PRINCE IVAN Was that Koshchei ? I suppose he was after you to marry him . IRENKA Yes . And I accepted . PRINCE IVAN ( Draws his sword ) You said you 'd marry him ? I 'll fix him ! I 'll make him sorry he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd marry him only if he could bring me three things in the world that I do n't already have . PRINCE IVAN Clever . ( Calming down reluctantly ) Yes , very clever . IRENKA Brain beats brawn , every time . PRINCE IVAN I hope you 're right . ( They exit ) ( Spot on RIMSKY/DIMSKY . RIMSKY is fast asleep . DIMSKY fidgets and groans then explodes . ) DIMSKY How much longer ! How long ! p. 20 DIMSKY Uhggm ? ( Wakes up suddenly ) What 's wrong , Dimsky ? DIMSKY How much longer do we have to sit here ? DIMSKY Forever , no doubt . Till the end of time , I should think . DIMSKY Ohhhhhhhhhhh ! Do n't say that ! ! ! DIMSKY Koshchei put us here to guard his death . As long as we guard his death , he will stay alive . As long as he stays alive he will keep us here to guard his death . So it is n't really an understatement to say we 'll be here forever . DIMSKY You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let someone dispose of it ? DIMSKY Unfortunately , no . We 're programmed to do everything in our power to protect it . DIMSKY But I do n't want to be a cyborg any more , Rimsky . I want to be a dragon again . A real dragon , belching smoke and flame and terrorizing the countryside . DIMSKY Forget it , Dimsky . The days of dragons are over . DIMSKY Over ! DIMSKY Well , think about it . Belching flame , knocking trees over , tearing up the landscape . The environment ca n't take that sort of thing any more . p. 21 DIMSKY I miss eating too . Remember all those yummy snacks we used to have . Terrified peasants . Tender little damsels . Incompetent heroes . DIMSKY Ueghh ! I think if I were on the loose again , Dimsky , I 'd like to try vegetarian . DIMSKY There ! See what being holed up like this has done to you ? What self respecting dragon would be vegetarian ? We 're losing our edge Rimsky . We used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one gives us a second look . DIMSKY It 's not all bad , being away from the hustle and bustle . There 's plenty of time for thinking and ( thoughtfully ) plenty of time for . . . medi-tay-shun . DIMSKY Meditation ! No way , Rimsky ! You promised . You 're only supposed to meditate when I 'm sleeping . DIMSKY Ohm ! DIMSKY I hate it when you do that . DIMSKY Ohm ! DIMSKY Rimsky ! Rats . I hate being left alone like this . ( KOSHCHEI enters ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS ( Goes to keyboard and pulls a switch or two . ) Well you mangy fire snorters . What mischief have you been up to ? p. 22 DIMSKY None , Your Lordship ! KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Tell the truth ! Or I 'll rearrange your scaly , incapable hide ! DIMSKY No mischief , Boss . Really . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Anyone been nosing around ? DIMSKY No sir ! KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS No one inquiring about the little matter of my death ? DIMSKY Uh uh . Your death is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE DEATHLESS What 's he doing ? DIMSKY Meditating . He read a book on expanded consciousness last week and now every time I turn around he 's humming his mantra . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Well , tell him to snap out of it . DIMSKY No way ! Last time he gave me a really nasty bite . You wake him up . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I will . ( Reaches out a hand to nudge RIMSKY . ) DIMSKY Ohm ! KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS ( Thinking better of it ) So maybe you can help me . Lady Irenka has agreed to marry me. p. 23 DIMSKY Great news ! KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Maybe . She 'll only marry me if I bring her three things she does n't have . DIMSKY Tough one . I 've heard that Irenka has everything it 's possible to have . But let 's see . . . ( Computer clicks . ) . . . There must be something . . . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS There 'd better be three things . If not , someone round here is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's a long time since we did any serious computing . Just give me a minute to warm up . . . ( Rumble , flicker , squeak , groan . ) O.K. , feed in the question . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS ( Keyboards as he speaks . ) " Name three things that Irenka does not have . " ( The computer wobbles and rattles and DIMSKY giggles . ) Stop that ! How can I concentrate with that racket ? DIMSKY Ticklish questions always make me giggle . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Answer the question ! DIMSKY Just give me a minute . I 'm a little rusty . Uh huh . Uh huh . Ahhhhyes . Yes . There are three things that Irenka does n't have and only three . If she 'd asked for four you 'd have been out of luck . p. 24 KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Quit babbling and tell me what they are . DIMSKY First there 's the Tree of Good and Evil . ( A printout emerges . ) DIMSKY Ohm . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS ( Examines the page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never heard of it . DIMSKY There is such a tree . It 's been hidden for centuries in the deepest darkest forests of Northern Zhar . Many have sought it : no one has found it . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Do n't worry . Koshchei will find it . What next ? ( The computer rumbles and another printout emerges . ) What are these little bottles ? Perfume ? She 's already got perfume . DIMSKY No . Those bottles contain the Waters of Life and Death . DIMSKY Ohm . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS ( Reading printout ) " Waters of Life and Death . They are to be found in Southern Zhar hidden in the valley of a thousand waterfalls . " DIMSKY It 's next to impossible to find them . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Nothing is impossible for Koshchei ! What 's the third thing ? p. 25 DIMSKY Now here 's where it gets sticky . There is something else that Irenka does n't have . But it 's really not possible . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Name it . DIMSKY I do n't know . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( The printer rattles and delivers . He tears off the printout and reads it . ) Firebird ! Yeah ! Why did n't I think of that ? DIMSKY But Firebird has lived in Zhar for a thousand and one years and no one has ever captured it . No one has even tried . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS There 's always a first time . DIMSKY You do n't understand . Firebird is what makes Zhar special . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS So ? DIMSKY If Firebird is captured Zhar will become a wasteland . A desert ! Do you want that on your conscience ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Conscience ? I 'm the villain ! I do n't have a conscience . The Tree of Good and Evil . The Waters of Life and Death . And Firebird . Well done guys ! Irenka , Bride of Koshchei ! I like the sound of that . You know , I 'm going to enjoy this . There 's nothing like a few impossible tasks to get the adrenaline flowing . ( Moves off ) p. 26 DIMSKY Excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like an assistant on your adventures . A very amenable , companionable dragon ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS No way , Dough Head ! ( Exits ) DIMSKY Ohhhhhhhhh ! I ca n't go on like this , Rimsky . I ca n't ! I want to have adventures . I want to fly again ! DIMSKY Ohm . ( Lights fade on dragons as lights come up on IRENKA looking in a mirror . IVAN enters . ) PRINCE IVAN What are you doing ? IRENKA I was wondering what I 'd look like with leathery lips . PRINCE IVAN You 're not still worrying about that are you . It was a dream . IRENKA If I was n't beautiful any more would you still love me ? PRINCE IVAN You 'll always be beautiful . IRENKA I would love you no matter what . PRINCE IVAN Well of course . IRENKA Before , I just loved you . Now I love you . PRINCE IVAN Uh huh . p. 27 IRENKA And I know why I love you . You see , you act like a jerk a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you 're not . Basically you 're a very good and kind person . That 's why I love you . PRINCE IVAN Good and kind . Terrific . I kind of hoped it was because I 'm such a handsome guy , romantic , heroic . IRENKA You were so nice to Baba when she arrived . PRINCE IVAN I threw her out on her ear . IRENKA And you did everything you could to please me . You ruined the kingdom to make me happy . PRINCE IVAN Ruined is a bit of an overstatement . IRENKA I 'm not saying it 's your fault . If I had n't been so difficult to please . I was such a fool . And Koshchei , I just treated him like any other suitor . How could I be so arrogant to think I could handle Koshchei . PRINCE IVAN You did handle him . IRENKA I was smart and I outwitted him . PRINCE IVAN Then what 's the problem ? PRINCE IVAN I do n't know if it was enough to stop him . There 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm learning , but there is n't time . . . It 's all happening so fast . p. 28 PRINCE IVAN What 's happening ? IRENKA We have so little time . ( There is a faint rumbling sound like distant thunder . ) Do you love me , Ivan ? PRINCE IVAN Of course I love you IRENKA You love that fathead Irenka , but do you love me ? PRINCE IVAN I do n't get it . IRENKA What if I really was turned to a wolf , would you love me then ? PRINCE IVAN It will never happen . IRENKA But would you ? ( Fanfare . KOSHCHEI enters carrying a small tree with golden fruit . IVAN watches the following slightly in shock at the boldness of it all . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS There you go . ( Plunks tree in front of IRENKA ) IRENKA What 's this ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS The Tree of Good and Evil . You got one ? IRENKA No , I have n't . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Did n't think so . IRENKA You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Piece of cake . It was supposed to be hidden in the deepest , darkest forests of North Zhar but it was standing right out in the open . Some dummy cut down all the trees . ( IVAN reacts to this by reaching for his sword . IRENKA holds him back . KOSHCHEI absorbed in his own cleverness does n't notice . ) See you tomorrow with present number two . Same time , same place . ( Exits ) IRENKA You see what I mean ? We 're in trouble ! PRINCE IVAN I thought you said it was an impossible task you gave him . IRENKA Well it would have been impossible if the trees had still been standing . PRINCE IVAN You do n't have to get self righteous . I did it for you . IRENKA Oh , I know . It 's just dumb luck for Koshchei . He 'll never find a second thing . ( Interlude of lights and ominous desolating music . IVAN and IRENKA frozen . The dark figures pull dark gauzy cloths over some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and runs off at the sound of KOSHCHEI approaching . He stomps on . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Where is she ! Where 's Irenka . Hey Irenka , Baby ! It 's day two . ( IVAN and IRENKA unfreeze ) p. 30 IRENKA Already ? You found something else I do n't have ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS In these little bottles . The Waters of Life and Death . They were hidden in South Zhar in the valley of a thousand waterfalls . Normally they would have been impossible to find . . . PRINCE IVAN ( Aside ) But some dummy damned up all the rivers . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS . . . when I got there , there was n't one waterfall in the whole valley . It only took me an hour to spot what I was looking for . The Waters of Life and Death , Kiddo . Present number two . IRENKA I do n't believe this . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS It was nothing , eh . Why did n't you give me something hard to do ? I did n't even get an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be outa shape if I keep this up . Do n't go away . Present number three coming up . Uh , maybe you should pick out what you 're going to wear for the wedding . ( Exits ) PRINCE IVAN Wedding ! That pompous idiot actually thinks he 's going to marry you . IRENKA What will I do , Ivan ? I do n't want to marry Koshchei . I want to marry you . PRINCE IVAN Do n't worry . He shall never have you . Not as long as I can draw sword and breath . Besides he has to find a third gift . It 's pretty unlikely , is n't it ? ( IRENKA looks in her mirror as though she sees something fearful in there. ) p. 31 IRENKA I think I know what the third thing is going to be , Ivan . Remember Baba 's dream ? She said it would be my fault . ( In the background the figures pull gauzy cloths over more of the set . Music slow , heavy and depressing . FIREBIRD floats on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand . ) PRINCE IVAN Ridiculous ! No one has ever captured Firebird . ( In slow dreamlike motion KOSHCHEI pursues FIREBIRD . ) IRENKA Perhaps Koshchei will . Perhaps we 've made it easy for him . PRINCE IVAN You 're starting to sound like Baba . Do n't worry about it . Think about our wedding . This is going to be the best , most spectacular wedding Zhar has ever witnessed . Dancing , music , feasting  --  every delectable dish that 's ever been created . . . IRENKA ( Picking up the ornate loaf ) And bread . It 's very beautiful , is n't it . ( At this moment the net is thrown over FIREBIRD . IRENKA cries out . BABA hurries forward to stop IVAN but , sword in hand , he pursues KOSHCHEI off . We hear clashing of swords and their alternating exchange of insults off . The lights dim . IRENKA unable to bear the fighting puts her hands over her ears and sinks to the ground. ) p. 32 PRINCE IVAN ( Off . His insults alternate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Cheese ball ! Tuning fork ! You lobotomized bone heap ! Stigma ! Turkey guts ! Dollop ! KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS ( Off ) Pimple ! Mouse Turd ! Numbskull ! Snake breath ! You offensive odour ! Fishbone ! Stench ! Spider breath !

BABA YOGA ( Peering into the gloom ) They 're still fighting . Koshchei seems to be winning . No wait ! Ivan is taking the upper hand . IRENKA Thank Heavens . And Firebird ? BABA YOGA Still in Koshchei 's net . Ivan ca n't reach her . ( IRENKA moans and clutches her head . ) BABA YOGA What is it ? IRENKA I feel strange . Too much excitement . BABA YOGA I 'll get you a glass of tea . IRENKA My jaw feels so big , as if it 's pulling apart from my face . p. 33 BABA YOGA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink then gives the cup back ) I ca n't .

BABA YOGA I ca n't see them . ( The light has been steadily dimming . ) IRENKA It 's strange sitting in the dark like this . I wish Ivan were here BABA YOGA I 'll light a candle . IRENKA Every bone in my body aches . What 's happening to me ? Look at my hands . BABA YOGA It 's a trick of light . IRENKA Your dream is coming true . BABA YOGA Perhaps Ivan will win after all . If only I could see . . . IRENKA It 's coming true . Every word you said . " That skin of yours will turn as rough as leather . " BABA YOGA It was only a dream . IRENKA " Those fine fingers of yours will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your ears will turn pointy and furry . " p. 34 BABA YOGA There they are ! Ivan is winning . He 's overcoming Koshchei ! Yes . Yes . Yes ! No. . . he ' s falling back . IRENKA You will become a wolfish creature , skulking in the shadows . BABA YOGA Koshchei is so powerful . ( There is a sudden flare of yellow light off and BABA cries out as is she 's seen something terrible . ) IRENKA What is it ! It 's Ivan , is n't it . ( KOSHCHEI comes on triumphantly , dragging Firebird . IRENKA approaches him fearfully . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Koshchei rules ! IRENKA Whose blood is that ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS No one beats Koshchei ! IRENKA Oh my poor Ivan . Where is he ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Dead . IRENKA And his body ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Cut into a thousand pieces and scattered on the endless steppes . And now let 's get down to business . Where is she ? IRENKA Who ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS My bride ! This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do as you please . Without Ivan I do n't care what happens . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Come on ! I have n't got all day . Tell me where she is . Where 's Irenka ? IRENKA Do n't you recognize me ? BABA YOGA ( Pulling IRENKA back ) Irenka has gone where no one can ever find her . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Do n't worry . I 'll find her . No one escapes Koshchei the Deathless . Irenka ! Irenka ! ( He storms off ) Irenka ! IRENKA But I 'm Irenka . He looked right at me and did n't know me ? BABA YOGA And lucky for you that he did n't . IRENKA I 've changed that much ? Oh Baba ! What are we to do ? What can we do ? BABA YOGA There is always something one can do Irenka . Do n't give up hope yet . IRENKA What is there to hope for ? Ivan is dead and I have become a beast of the wilderness . ( IRENKA raises her head and the light catches her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as darkness falls. ) @x ( Darkness and dirge-like music punctuated with wolf howls . Dim lights arise . The gray drapes now cover everything , giving an effect of desolation and decay . ) IRENKA Awoooooh ! Awoooooh ! ( While BABA bustles about gathering things , IRENKA , fully transformed to a wolf , sits alone , solemn and sad . Beside her is the Tree of Good and Evil and a knapsack . In the foreground is a large embroidered cloth with a lumpish form underneath it . ) IRENKA ( Pulling a wedding veil from knapsack ) Just yesterday I was trying this on and dreaming of my wedding . And now I shall never wear it . Awoooooh ! Awoooooh ! BABA YOGA Oshki Petroshki ! You 'll drive me mad with that wailing . Do something constructive . Ah ! ( Stoops , picks something up and puts it happily into her basket . ) Nine hundred and Ninety ! And here 's 991 . ( Stoops again ) Good , good , good ! Not as bad as I thought . Just nine pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRENKA ( Sniffing round the Tree of Good and Evil , whining a bit . ) BABA YOGA You should eat one of those fruits . They will make you wise . p. 37 IRENKA I needed to be wise sooner than this . ( Something catches her attention at the foot of the tree . She stalks it hungrily. while Baba picks up 994 and 995 ) IRENKA ( Pounces ) Ughhgrh ! BABA YOGA Stop bouncing around like that and help me . IRENKA ( Her paws are on the object she 's been stalking and she licks her lips . ) A nice little snack . Juicy and crunchy . . . BABA YOGA Umm ? Bring me those two little bottles , will you ? I 'm just about ready for them . ( Gathers 996 and 997 . ) Irenka ? IRENKA ( She picks up a paw and whatever it is escapes . She chases it wildly about the stage . ) Ughhgrh ! Ughhgrh ! BABA YOGA Irenka ! Irenka ! ( IRENKA stops short and looks guilty . ) What on earth are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring me those bottles Koshchei gave you . IRENKA The Waters of Life and Death ? I have them here . ( IRENKA reads the labels on the bottles . ) " Use with caution for the reversal of metamorphosis and death . " ( Looks thoughtful ) Baba ? p. 38 BABA YOGA Just three more fragments and we can relax . Oh dear , oh dear . It 's always those last few bits that are the hardest . Ah , 998 ! Oh ! Move your foot ! ( Picks up 999 and beams happily at it. ) 999 ! IRENKA What 's metamorphosis ? BABA YOGA It 's when something is changed into something else . IRENKA Such as ? BABA YOGA Such as when a caterpillar becomes a butterfly . Such as when a frog becomes a prince . IRENKA And when a woman becomes a wolf ? BABA YOGA That 's metamorphosis , all right . IRENKA Then I 'm saved ! BABA YOGA ( Worriedly looking for the last bit ) Oh my dear , my dear . To come so close . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last piece . IRENKA ( Grabbing BABA and dancing about ) Baba ! Everything 's wonderful ! BABA YOGA Not yet it is n't . We have one more piece to go . And it could be anywhere on the endless steppes . IRENKA What are you looking for ? ( Runs sniffing about. ) p. 39 BABA YOGA I 'm not sure exactly . ( Pokes about in her basket . ) A knuckle bone , I think . IRENKA A knuckle bone ? I 'd like a nice knuckle bone , right now . Any kind of a bone . ( Looks a little wistful . Then spots something . ) Does it have a ring on it ? BABA YOGA Yes ! That 's it ! One thousand ! We 're saved , saved ! ( She snatches it up and hurries with her basket to the large sheet in the foreground and begins adding the contents of her basket to what 's already under there . ) IRENKA Yes , it 's wonderful , is n't it . I 'm going to be a woman again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use these . BABA YOGA ( She is now arranging the things under the cloth . ) This goes there I think . Yes . The last bit ! ( Looks at her work in satisfaction . ) IRENKA All I have to do , apparently , is sprinkle the contents of these bottles over myself and , PRESTO ! ( Starts to open bottle ) BABA YOGA Irenka ! What are you doing ? No ! Wait a minute ! ( Shouts ) SIT ! ! ! p. 40 IRENKA ( Automatically sits like a puppy looking puzzled . ) What ? BABA YOGA If you use those potions on yourself , you will never see Ivan again . IRENKA But Ivan is dead . And not just dead . Scattered all over the place . BABA YOGA And what do you think I 've been doing for the last twenty four hours ? Come here . Come on . Have a look at this . IRENKA What is it ? BABA YOGA Come and see . ( She lifts blanket and IRENKA peeps underneath . ) IRENKA Supper ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Irenka ! Do n't you see who it is ? IRENKA Oh ! It 's Ivan ! But he 's all in pieces . Oh poor Ivan ! Seeing him like this . . . ( She breaks down and whimpers . ) BABA YOGA I do n't know what you 're sniveling about . He 's all there , all one thousand pieces of him . IRENKA It was kind of you to gather him up , Baba . I guess now we can give him a. . . a decent burial . p. 41 BABA YOGA I did n't spend all that time gathering him up just to bury him . We 're going to revive him . IRENKA Bring him back to life ? But how ? BABA YOGA You read the labels on the bottles . IRENKA " For the reversal of metamorphosis and . . . death . " You mean these potions will bring him back to life ? That 's wonderful ! BABA YOGA I know . Hand them over . IRENKA Wait a minute . How much are you going to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you spare a drop or two for me ? BABA YOGA It 's your choice . Ivan 's life . Your looks . IRENKA It 's a bit more than looks . If I give these up I 'll have to remain a wolf all my life . I ca n't give up my only hope . BABA YOGA As I said it 's your choice . IRENKA Here ! Before I change my mind . ( She hands over the bottle and moves off . ) BABA YOGA Where are you going ? I need you to help me. p. 42 IRENKA Do I have to ? BABA YOGA Hold this coverlet up . IRENKA ( Holds cover then spots something ) Wait ! Is n't that bit upside down ? BABA YOGA Oshki Petroshki ! His knee ! He would n't have thanked me for that ! There . I think everything 's in order . First a little fragrance to help things along . ( She removes a small bowl from her pocket and lights the contents . Smoke drifts up like incense . ) Give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vial from IRENKA and sprinkles it ceremoniously on IVAN . ) Flesh and bone and cloth and leather . Assemble all and join together . ( Strange lights and music . ) There ! That did the trick ! IRENKA Wow ! All the pieces have joined together ! ( They remove the sheet revealing IVAN 's still and lifeless body . ) IRENKA Even his clothes are mended . But he 's so still . BABA YOGA Give me the vial marked " Life " . From the valley of the shadow to the vale of tears , restore to this sinner his appointed years . ( She sprinkles the water over his body . More lights and sound . IVAN comes to life jerkily. ) p. 43 PRINCE IVAN I 'm thirsty . Bring me water . BABA YOGA There 's no water to drink here . IRENKA Oh Ivan . You look wonderful . How do you feel ? PRINCE IVAN A little unsteady . What happened to me ? IRENKA You were dead Ivan . Koshchei . . . PRINCE IVAN Koshchei ! Where 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all he can think of is his sword . PRINCE IVAN A man needs his sword . BABA YOGA Firebird wo n't be regained by your sword . PRINCE IVAN Firebird . I remember now . I 've really been dead ? IRENKA And cut into a thousand yummy little pieces . PRINCE IVAN Then how can I be here ? IRENKA Baba restored you , with the Waters of Life and Death . PRINCE IVAN Thank you Baba . I will pay you well for your trouble . IRENKA She did n't do it for pay , Ivan . PRINCE IVAN I know that . All the same . . . ( He notices IRENKA for the first time . ) You 're a wolf ! I 'm talking to a wolf ! Perhaps I 'm dreaming after all . p. 44 IRENKA Do n't you know me Ivan ? PRINCE IVAN No , I ca n't say . . . Irenka ? But what happened ? IRENKA Baba 's dream came true . PRINCE IVAN My poor beautiful Irenka . IRENKA Do n't worry about it . PRINCE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is plenty to be done . First , you must find and release Firebird . Nothing can progress without that . Second , you must seek out the death of Koshchei . As long as he 's on the loose no one in Zhar will be safe . And lastly , you must restore Zhar to it 's former splendour . PRINCE IVAN And how are we to do all this ? I do n't even have my sword . CLAIRE I give up . You 've learned nothing . Nothing ! ( Moves off ) IRENKA Wait ! Have you no advice for us , Baba ? BABA YOGA Choose the plain over the fancy , the difficult over the easy . Beware of gaudy bedazzlements and USE YOUR NOODLE ! IRENKA That 's it ? PRINCE IVAN What kind of advice is that ! p. 45 BABA YOGA The kind I give . IRENKA But how do we find Firebird ? PRINCE IVAN Firebird is easy . We just find that devil Koshchei and make him release it . IRENKA Really easy . PRINCE IVAN I can handle Koshchei @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It was a pure fluke that he overpowered me . BABA YOGA Listen Ivan . At some point you are going to have to gain wisdom . I ca n't help you do that . I can give you instructions . But if you do n't have the sense to follow them , why should I waste my breath ? PRINCE IVAN I wo n't make the same mistake twice . BABA YOGA You 'd better not . If Koshchei kills you again there are no more magic potions to bring you to life . Now , here 's what you do . Koshchei has imprisoned Firebird in his garden . You can find that garden by walking always to the east , for as long as it takes . You will find Firebird in a jewelled cage . The cage can not be opened by hand . It opens only to a special word . PRINCE IVAN Do you know that word , Baba ? p. 46 BABA YOGA It is the name of the most precious thing in the garden . If you say that name three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get Firebird ? BABA YOGA You must free Firebird immediately and you must not under any circumstances touch the cage . That is all I can tell you . PRINCE IVAN It sounds easy enough . BABA YOGA It could be the easiest thing in the world . Unless . . . PRINCE IVAN Unless ? BABA YOGA Just do as I said . May fortune bless you . IRENKA Baba ? BABA YOGA Good-bye . And Good luck . ( She goes into the trunk and vanishes . ) IRENKA Wait Baba ! Rats ! I wanted to ask her about Koshchei 's death . PRINCE IVAN We 'll worry about that once we 've freed Firebird . We 'd better get going  --  we have a long journey ahead of us . IRENKA Let me get my pack . ( She fastens it and packs it up . Almost as an afterthought she picks two fruits from the Tree of Good and Evil . She catches Ivan looking at her . ) What ? p. 47 PRINCE IVAN Nothing . IRENKA What 's so fascinating ? PRINCE IVAN Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PRINCE IVAN Oh you do n't look so bad . IRENKA No ? PRINCE IVAN No . You look . . . Well to tell you the truth , I like the way you look . You remind me of Vereniki . IRENKA Who 's Vereniki ? PRINCE IVAN He was a hunting dog I once had . IRENKA A dog ! PRINCE IVAN He was a really great dog . IRENKA We 'd better go . PRINCE IVAN It 's a compliment Irenka ! IRENKA We have a lot of walking to do . PRINCE IVAN Wolfie ! I mean Irenka ! Wait up ! ( They exit . ) ( Scene shifts to music . Time and space change . ) ( FIREBIRD limps on , still bound with the net , bedraggled and lusterless . KOSHCHEI follows with a brightly jewelled cage . He strips the net from FIREBIRD and pushes it into the cage. ) p. 48 KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS In you go . And do n't look so miserable . This garden is reserved for the most beautiful and valuable things in the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the cage . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Do n't waste your energy . This cage is locked up tight and Koshchei is the only one who can open it , because Koshchei is the only one who knows the magic word . And it is n't please ! ( FIREBIRD slumps down in a dejected heap ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Look at you ! You 're not much of a prize , are you . You 're supposed to be a Firebird . Where 's the fire ? Brighten up ! Or you wo n't get any supper ! ( Stomps off ) ( FIREBIRD does a sad little dance in its cage , a dance of mourning and imprisonment . Then slumps down again in despair . ) ( The light dims to pitch black . IVAN comes on . In the background a loping figure can be seen stalking IVAN . ) PRINCE IVAN Irenka ! Where are you ? Darn it . Why ca n't you walk along like a normal person . ( He sits down and the shadow comes up and sits behind him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we ever get there if you keep running after rabbits and things . IRENKA ( Right behind him ) There are no rabbits and things . ( IVAN jumps ) p. 49 IRENKA Relax . It 's only me . PRINCE IVAN You 're driving me crazy with all your jumping about . IRENKA I 'm just looking for something to eat . But there 's nothing . Zhar is a desert . PRINCE IVAN I wonder how much further it is to the garden . We 've been walking forever . IRENKA It just seems like forever . PRINCE IVAN And it 's so dark . I ca n't see a thing . PRINCE IVAN I like it better in the dark . You ca n't see how ruined everything is . PRINCE IVAN Zhar used to be so beautiful and now it 's a wasteland . No flowers , no birds . No animals of any kind . IRENKA Not even a mouse . PRINCE IVAN And no water . I 'd give anything for some water , right now . IRENKA I 'd give anything for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bread . ) PRINCE IVAN What are you doing ? IRENKA I brought our wedding bread along . Do you want some ? p. 50 PRINCE IVAN Wedding bread ? We 're not still engaged are we . IRENKA No ! Animals and people ca n't be engaged . PRINCE IVAN I thought so . IRENKA Have some bread . PRINCE IVAN ( Accepts bread ) Thanks . ( Tastes it ) This bread is delicious . I 've never tasted anything so good . IRENKA Me either . PRINCE IVAN Is there any more ? ( IRENKA pulls out the loaf and the veil comes with it . ) PRINCE IVAN If we 're not engaged why are you hauling that wedding veil around ? IRENKA To remind me how foolish I was not to know when I was happy . PRINCE IVAN Yes we were happy , were n't we . ( Remembers ) You can sit next to me if you like . IRENKA You want me to ? PRINCE IVAN Well yes . It 's warmer that way . IRENKA ( Sitting next to him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puts his arm round her . ) But having someone with you makes the cold and the dark better somehow . IRENKA Do you think we 'll ever find Firebird . PRINCE IVAN Baba said we would . She 's been right about everything else . IRENKA Too right . PRINCE IVAN Hey cheer up . Let 's have some more bread . ( He picks up the loaf and the bottles fall out . ) What 's this . These are the vials that Koshchei gave you . Waters of Life and Death . Keeping them for sentimental value ? ( She pulls away ) Just kidding . IRENKA That 's what Baba used to bring you back to life . PRINCE IVAN There 's some writing on them . IRENKA Put them away . You ca n't read in the dark . PRINCE IVAN I can . The letters are glowing . " Use with caution to reverse metamorphosis and death . " To reverse metamorphosis ? But Irenka , these potions would have made you a woman again . Did you know that ? IRENKA Of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 52 IRENKA Better than have you dead forever . PRINCE IVAN Do you really mean that ? IRENKA I brought you back , did n't I ? ( She runs off ) PRINCE IVAN Irenka ! Wait ! Where are you going ? ( He pursues her and they come into the garden area . FIREBIRD glows with joy to see them . There are sounds of running water . ) PRINCE IVAN Did the moon come out ? I thought I saw a light . IRENKA I saw it too . ( FIREBIRD glows more warmly . ) PRINCE IVAN Look ! Firebird ! IRENKA We must be in Koshchei 's garden . PRINCE IVAN See how everything 's lighting up . It 's so beautiful . IRENKA The only place in Zhar that is n't ruined . What are you doing ? PRINCE IVAN I 'm going to free Firebird . IRENKA Remember not to touch the cage . PRINCE IVAN Oh my stars ! I almost forgot . What did Baba say we should do ? p. 53 IRENKA Name the most precious thing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IVAN There are so many precious things . Maybe it 's this matouchka . Look how fine it is . Matouchka , matouchka , matouchka . IRENKA This flower . A flower 's more precious than a matouchka . Flower . Flower . Flower . PRINCE IVAN This jewelled bird . This is n't getting us anywhere . IRENKA Think ! Out of everything in this garden what would you want most ? BOTH ( Think . Then , inspiration . ) What we came to get ! PRINCE IVAN Firebird , Firebird , Firebird ! ( At each repetition FIREBIRD brightens but the cage does n't open . They slump down again trying to think . ) PRINCE IVAN We 're never going to get it . Is there anything else to eat in there ? IRENKA ( Rummaging in pack ) Some fruit from the Tree of Good and Evil . But it 's not to stop hunger , it 's to make you wiser . PRINCE IVAN Is n't that what we need right now ? IRENKA Yes ! ( Pulls out golden fruit and they each eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so good . Do you feel any wiser ? p. 54 PRINCE IVAN I just feel thirsty . I wish you 'd packed something to drink . IRENKA Some champagne , maybe ? PRINCE IVAN No , water . That 's what I 'd really like right now . ( FIREBIRD flutters and gestures frantically ) IRENKA Listen Ivan , Can you hear something ? PRINCE IVAN It sounds like water ! ( FIREBIRD gestures again . This time IRENKA notices and following FIREBIRD 's gestures , pulls back a branch to reveal a fountain . They both drink thirstily . ) PRINCE IVAN Who would have thought simple water would taste so good . Water is the most precious thing ( He looks up at IRENKA in discovery ) in the world ! IRENKA In the world ! ( She flings some of it in the air . ) In the Garden ! PRINCE IVAN It 's worth a try . Water , water , water ! ( The cage opens and IVAN steps in to untangle FIREBIRD from the net . ) Here , I 'll help you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a jewel in the cage door . ) This cages is really something . Look at the size of that ruby ! It must be worth a fortune ! p. 55 IRENKA Ivan ! Do n't ! ( But IVAN reaches out and touches it and while clanging alarm bells go off , the door closes shut on IVAN and FIREBIRD . ) IRENKA Ivan ! PRINCE IVAN I just wanted to see what it felt like . I was n't thinking Oh , Irenka , I thought this would be so easy . ( IVAN shakes the cage in frustration and bells ring again . ) ( KOSHCHEI enters . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Well , well , well . What 's this caught in my snare ? Ivan ? I thought I had disposed of you . What have you got to say for yourself. ? PRINCE IVAN Let me out of here , snake breath , and I 'll have plenty to say . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I see you like dying . ( He raises his sword . IRENKA rushes between them . ) IRENKA No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What use is she to you . She 's only valuable when she 's free . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS She 's a fake . I have n't seen any fire . I 've a good mind to kill them both ! IRENKA No ! Please ! Maybe we can work a deal . I could pay a rich ransom for them . Money . Jewels . p. 56 KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS There is only one thing I will take in exchange for theses worthless insects . Only one jewel . Irenka . She promised to marry Koshchei . Make Irenka keep her promise and I 'll let them go . IRENKA It shall be done . ( Koshchei turns to leave . ) PRINCE IVAN Quick Irenka , the password , say it . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Oh and do n't waste time trying to spring those two . I 've changed the password . ( KOSHCHEI exits . ) PRINCE IVAN Oh I 'd like to get my hands on him . What good is it to promise him Irenka ? Do you think he wants to marry a wolf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighten up ! PRINCE IVAN I 'm sorry . I did n't mean to hurt your feelings , Wolfie . Wolfie . Come here . ( She goes over reluctantly . He scratches her behind the ear . ) You 're beautiful just the way you are . IRENKA Oh sure ! PRINCE IVAN And if Koshchei does n't see that it 's his problem . IRENKA And you 'd love to marry me yourself if only you were free , right ? p. 57 PRINCE IVAN I would . I will ! IRENKA Lucky for you that wolves and men ca n't marry . PRINCE IVAN Well I 'll tell you one thing . I 'll never marry anyone else . IRENKA Really , Ivan ? Oh rats . Why are we daydreaming like this . Mooning about here is n't going to solve anything . PRINCE IVAN What are you doing ? IRENKA I have an idea ( She gets the wedding veil and wraps it heavily about her face . FIREBIRD looks on with interest and glows from time to time . IVAN looks unconvinced . ) IRENKA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's showing . ( She tucks it up ) Do you thing Koshchei will be fooled for one minute ? It 'll never work . IRENKA Have you got a better idea ? Shake the cage . Go on ! Shake it. ! ( IVAN shakes the cage and the bells ring KOSHCHEI comes storming out in a rage . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Stop that racket or I 'll . . . ( He spots IRENKA . ) Well , well , well . What have we here ? p. 58 IRENKA Your bride , oh Great Koshchei . I regret that I took so long to honour my vow . I had to say good-bye to my dear , dear family . I 'm very attached to them and we cried a lot , you know ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Hey , I know . I understand . IRENKA So this is Firebird . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Your last present , Irenka . IRENKA Oh Koshchei , my beloved , let her out of the cage so I can see her dance . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I will my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . IRENKA Just one little dance ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Uh , uh , uh , uh ! Marriage first . IRENKA You 're so cute . Who 's this in with Firebird ? Ivan ? Is that you ? PRINCE IVAN ( Groans in frustration ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Yes . I 'm going to sharpen my sword on him just as soon as we 're married . IRENKA I do n't want any violence on my wedding day . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS How about the day after ? p. 59 IRENKA I do n't know why a big strong fellow like you wants to bother with that poor little wart . PRINCE IVAN Wart ! ( Shakes his cage . Bells ring . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS You 're right , Beloved . I 'll let him go . Just as soon as we 're married . ( Behind IRENKA 's back and to IVAN ) As if . Speaking of which , time to get on with the wedding . I ca n't wait to lift that veil and give you a big smooshy kiss ! IRENKA Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I must walk in the garden to prepare myself . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I will walk with you , my treasure . IRENKA Oh , no-no-no , my Jewel . I want to be alone . I want to dispel the cruel grief that lies in my heart for my family . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS I 'll send for your family . Come ! IRENKA Wait ! I. . . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS No more delays . Let 's have that kiss . Smoosh , smoosh , smoosh ! IRENKA After the wedding darling . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Let me see that cute little face . ( He lifts the veil . ) What ? What 's this . ( IRENKA bites his nose . KOSHCHEI bellows in pain and lets go of her. ) p. 60 KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS By dose ! She bit by dose ! No one bites Koshchei ! ( In a rage , he rushes about trying to catch her , brandishing his sword . Grabs her tail and it comes off . She cries out in pain and escapes . ) KOSCHEI THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to smithereens with one blow of my hand ! ( He storms out . Ivan who has been rattling the cage all this time so that the bells ring madly , cries out . ) PRINCE IVAN Irenka ! Irenka ! ( In despair ) Irenka . ( Lights fade to black and noisy chaos , come up on RIMSKY/DIMSKY . IRENKA comes on stripping off her veil . She spots the dragon . ) IRENKA The cyber dragon . Maybe it can tell me the secret of Koshchei 's death . No harm in trying . I 'll just feed in a few questions . ( Types ) " What happened to Koshchei 's death and how can I find it ? " ( As she fools with the keyboard RIMSKY and DIMSKY wake up from their snooze . ) DIMSKY What are you doing ! Get out of here ! DIMSKY Wolf thing . IRENKA I was just asking a question or two . ( They snap at her hands and she withdraws. ) p. 61 IRENKA I was just trying to find out about the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IRENKA Then you know where it is . DIMSKY We do n't give away secrets , Wolf thing . IRENKA Oh really . What 's that over there ? BOTH DRAGONS Where ? What ? IRENKA On that tree . DIMSKY I do n't see anything . DIMSKY Neither do I. DIMSKY I do n't even see a tree . ( While they fluster she types in her question . ) IRENKA " Where is Koschei 's death ? " BOTH DRAGONS Oohhh ! Get away . Buzz off ! IRENKA Too late I 've fed in the question already , and now you have to answer it . Where is Koshchei 's death ? DIMSKY Our banks are sealed . IRENKA ( Thinks a minute ) Obviously I must catch these boys off guard . Let me see . Ah ! Dimsky . I really did n't realize you were so handsome . p. 62 DIMSKY Oh well you know we dragons . . . DIMSKY Watch it , Dimsky . She 's trying to get you off guard . If you think you can distract us , Wolf thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , Rimsky . I bet you were a really cute baby . DIMSKY I was actually . I was the cutest baby in all of Zhar . DIMSKY What ! No you were n't ! I was the cutest baby in Zhar . DIMSKY I was the cutest , Dimsky . Mom even said . DIMSKY She did not ! DIMSKY Did too ! DIMSKY Did not ! DIMSKY Did too ! DIMSKY Did not ! ( While they argue IRENKA types in the message again . ) IRENKA Where is Koshchei 's death ? ( They go on arguing as the printer spews out the answer . She reads it ) " Matouchka , Petrouchka , chicken and egg . " BOTH DRAGONS What did you say ? IRENKA Matouchka , Petrouchka , chicken and egg . What does that mean ? p. 63 DIMSKY Oh my claws and nostrils ! She knows ! She 's accessed the memory banks . DIMSKY Shh ! It 's nothing , my dear . Just a little riddle we sometimes say . IRENKA Oh say it to me . I like riddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't tell me . I 'll show this to Koshchei ! DIMSKY I 'll see if I can remember it . Matouchka , Petrouchka , Where can it be Somebody 's death is hidden from thee . IRENKA Somebody ? Must be Koshchei . Go on . I said , go on . DIMSKY Oshki Petroshki , Minsk and Pinsk . He hid it away And it ai n't been seen since . IRENKA But where did he hide it . BOTH DRAGONS Matouchka , Petrouchka , Chicken and Egg It 's no use to plead it 's no use to beg . No use in asking where it might be . Somebody 's death is hidden from thee . IRENKA Matouchka , Petrouchka . ( Wanders about in thought ) Matouchka , Petrouchka . Oh ! ( She stops in front of the big matouchka . ) Matouchka ! Am I getting warm ? p. 64 DIMSKY No-no-no-no-no ! DIMSKY You 're waaaaay off . DIMSKY Cold . ( IRENKA opens the Matouchka . Inside is a Clown figure ) IRENKA Petrouchka ! BOTH DRAGONS Oh my claws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Koshchei will unplug us . Oh Oh Oh Oh Deconstruct Decon concon ( Computer babble winding down to slow slow slow and a puff of smoke comes out . The dragons shrink , deflate and collapse . ) IRENKA I think they 've burnt out . Now let 's see what 's in here . Matouchka , Petrouchka , Chicken ! ( There is a chicken inside the Clown . ) ( KOSHCHEI come in . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Stop ! IRENKA You 're looking a little pale , Koshchei . Is something troubling you ? Is there something you do n't want me to find ? Matouchka , Petrouchka , Chicken . . . ( Opens the Chicken . There 's an Egg inside . ) Oh . Egg ! KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Give me that . IRENKA I want to see what 's inside KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS No don't. p. 65 IRENKA Your death 's in here , is n't it . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Do you realize that I could turn you to stone with a snap of my fingers . IRENKA And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of my hands ? Would it escape you ? Would it fly out into the world and you would never be safe again ? KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Wait . Look Wolf . I 'll let them go , Ivan and Firebird . Just give me the egg . IRENKA Let them go first . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS All right , all right ! Just do n't . . . IRENKA Go on . I 'll follow you . ( KOSHCHEI leads the way back to the garden looking anxiously over his shoulder . ) KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Just do n't drop it . ( IVAN leaps up . ) PRINCE IVAN Irenka ! Are you all right ? IRENKA Let them out . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS Life . Life . Life ! ( Opens the cage with a snap of his finger . FIREBIRD dances off joyously and exits . ) Now give me that . p. 66 IRENKA I do n't think so . KOSCHEI THE DEATHLESS You mangy hound . ( He lunges forward . ) PRINCE IVAN Irenka , be careful . ( IVAN deflects KOSHCHEI so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does not deflect KOSHCHEI 's blow . As the egg opens she falls to the ground . KOSHCHEI catches the egg but his death eludes him , flutters just beyond his grasp as he tries to contain it again . He races off after it , crying piteously . ) PRINCE IVAN Irenka . She 's dying . What shall I do ? ( He cradles her ) Irenka please do n't die . ( BABA YAGA enters . ) BABA YOGA They have done well , Ivan and Irenka . They saved Firebird and stopped that villain Koshchei . He will have no more time for wicked deeds . He will chase his death around the world and back . By then he will be old and helpless . So far they have been successful . But it remains to be seen if they can restore Zhar to its former glory . PRINCE IVAN Wolf is dying , Baba . Nothing else is important to me . Not Zhar . Not Firebird . Not Koshchei . How can I save her ? BABA YOGA There is a way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must give up the thing most precious to you . PRINCE IVAN She could have been beautiful again and she gave it up for me . I would give up anything for her . BABA YOGA So be it . PRINCE IVAN My horse ? Dogs ? Kingdom ? No . It must be my life . What could be more precious than that ? Yes I will give my life for hers . Just let my dear Irenka live . Ahh ! Ohh ! ( Dark and changing lights swirl about and omnious sounds and snatches of music can be heard . Ivan writhes and spins and leaps about in what seems like death agony . ) PRINCE IVAN Kill me quickly this is torture ! BABA YOGA Let go ! ( Light and sounds become even more frenzied . PRINCE IVAN This is too painful ! It 's agony ! Ca n't you finish me off ? BABA YOGA Just let go ! PRINCE IVAN Oh please ! ( IVAN falls to the ground as though dead . Then realizes  --  a wiggling toe , a flexing hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? p. 68 BABA YOGA Well what ? PRINCE IVAN I 'm not dead . BABA YOGA Who said anything about dying ? PRINCE IVAN But I thought I was giving up the thing most precious to me . Irenka ! ( He goes back to her and sorrowfully gathers her in his arms . ) Irenka . BABA YOGA It appears that the most precious thing to Ivan , as is it for most people , was not his life but his point of view . He has just had all his most cherished opinions ripped from him . PRINCE IVAN It hurt like anything BABA YOGA Not surprising . All those comforting lies , all those illusions , all those prejudices . It hurts to give them up . PRINCE IVAN It did n't work , though . Irenka 's still dead . Irenka ! IRENKA ( Wakes up . She has shed her wolfish appearance ) What happened ? PRINCE IVAN Thank the stars ! Are you all right ? IRENKA I think so . Yes . I am . I 'm fine . ( She touches her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'm not a wolf any more . Is it true ? p. 69 PRINCE IVAN Yes it 's true . IRENKA Not a wolf . Oh Ivan . ( Jumps up ) It just seems like a bad dream . PRINCE IVAN Everything 's back as it was . BABA YOGA Not everything . PRINCE IVAN But it will be soon . With Irenka back everything 's possible . IRENKA Suppose we ca n't restore Zhar , Ivan . You saw how wasted it was when we came here . PRINCE IVAN We 'll start here with Koshchei 's garden . And we 'll work hard . Whatever hard work can accomplish that at least will be done IRENKA Where is Firebird ? BABA YOGA Flew away in all the panic . IRENKA But how can we restore Zhar without Firebird ? PRINCE IVAN We 'll do what we can . Make it as good as we can . We have to try , do n't we ? IRENKA Yes we do . And we have each other . That 's something . PRINCE IVAN That may be everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on tentatively ) p. 70 IRENKA Look Ivan ! Firebird ! PRINCE IVAN She 's lighting up everything ! ( FIREBIRD begins to dance . Soon IVAN and IRENKA dance too , pulling the gauzy drapes from the trunks , letting the cheerful colours show through . BABA picks up one of the drapes and folds it up . ) BABA YOGA Will you look at that ! Happy as beets in borscht . They do n't know how hard it 's going to be . They do n't have a snowball 's hope in Honolulu of making things work . But that 's the effect Firebird has on people . Ridiculous , optimistic fools ! ( FIREBIRD dances more wildly . When it comes to the cyborg dragon it touches them lightly . RIMSKY and DIMSKY come to , drowsily , and find they are not only alive but free once more . DIMSKY Free ! We 're free ! DIMSKY Oh my claws and nostrils . We are ! Free ! ( They dance too , a little smoke and flames of joy bursting from their nostrils . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 'll sing till our feet hurt and dance till our throats are sore ! Everyone 's invited ! Rimsky and Dimsky you must come too and especially you Baba , our most treasured friend and advisor . BABA YOGA ( Shrugs ) It 's nice to be appreciated . p. 71 PRINCE IVAN We 'll name our first daughter after you . IRENKA ( Loud distracted whisper ) Ivan ! We ca n't name a baby BABA YAGA ! PRINCE IVAN Why not ? BABA YOGA Actually , my given name is Vasilisa . ( IVAN and IRENKA continue dancing . BABA holds up an ornamental wedding loaf and dances between them . ) THE END
