Lee Trambath was a fifty-five-year-old restaurant manager , with three ex-wives and five children . He was a slender , dark-haired man with a trimmed beard that was mostly gray , and he lived and worked in a small Massachusetts town , near the sea . The children were from his first two marriages , three daughters and two sons , grown now and spread up and down the Eastern seaboard from Charleston to Portland , all in places he liked to visit . None of them was married ; they all had lovers . Lee was on good terms with the two mothers of his children ; time had healed him , had allowed him to forget whatever he and the women had done to each other , or removed the precision of pain from his memory ; and sometimes , sitting alone in his apartment or strolling on the boardwalk along the river flowing a mile or so to the ocean , he wished as a boy does : that in some way his first marriage had never ended , yet that his second had occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be on the earth ; and that he and the two women and five children were one family . This frequent wish was never erotic : his images were of him and the two women and five children in living rooms , dining rooms , on lawns . It was the third wife , and the women in their forties whom he dated after his divorce from her , who made him refer to his last marriage as absolutely his last . <p> His third wife was nearly forty when they married . She had two daughters who were aging her with their listless work in high school , slovenly lives at home , strong-willed disobedience , and unsavory boyfriends whose tight clothing seemed only a cover to get from their cars to the house and , with the girls , back to their cars . Lee did what he could , with tender hesitance ; the girls ' father had moved to Houston when they were six and eight , and sent them checks on birthdays and at Christmas . Lee silently predicted pregnancies , abortions , and a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college , which even they would be able to attend and muddle through , they would work at jobs to pay for clothes , cars , and apartments ; and , like most people , they would settle softly into mundane lives . For Lee , the household was often frenzied and barely tolerable , with three females crying at once , but he was forty-nine , he had spent most of his adult life with families , and he could bear it . <p> His wife did not hold up as well , and told him to get a vasectomy . He did not want to . Gently and reasonably he said he would not mind being sterile if it simply happened to him , if nature retired him from the ranks of fertility ; but he did not want it done to him by a doctor ; and , more importantly , he did not want to choose to have it done , but this was- a hair he could not split for her . She was not gentle , and if her argument was reasonable , her scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not loving her , made reason hard to discern . She would not make love with him until he gave in ; and he did , because he understood her fears more than he understood his resistance , and he wanted to keep peace , so when he consented he began to see her demand as a request that could not be made calmly . Who could turn away from a drowning woman because her plea for help came not as a whisper but a scream ? Undressing for surgery , he felt he was giving up his life as he had known it ; and afterward , when he brought his sperm to be tested , he hoped the surgeon had failed ; or , rather , that his sperm remained , undaunted by scalpel , or his wife , or himself . His wife was relieved , and soon he was , too , and peace returned , or they returned to it . <p> When it did not last , when its not lasting slowly burned to ashes all kindness and respect in the marriage , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and seeing his two stepdaughters there and in restaurants , and dating again , he thought of his vasectomy as a concealed deformity , something he was hiding from women . No one he dated wanted more children , but still he always felt he was dissembling , until he told them , and one and all looked into his eyes as though he had spread yellow roses between them on the bar , the dinner table , or the bed . <p> He had married his first two wives when they were in their twenties , and he was the first husband of both ; and always , however small , the shadows of sadness and failure were cast upon him : all his love and serious intent had increased the population of divorcees by two . His union with his third wife was his first with a divorcee ; and her ax-husband , or what he had done to her , or what she believed he had done to her with no provocation at all , was a fulcrum in her marriage to Lee : he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man he had never known . Now , dating , he collided with the presence of a man , or men , he only knew because a woman was pouting or crying or yelling or throwing a kitchen utensil at him , once a potholder , once a breadboard . The pain and bitterness , fear and distrust , of these women seemed all to be caused by one of his gender , not only husbands and lovers , but fathers and stepfathers as well . Confronted by these lives in which not one woman , including the woman herself , had ever been anything but kind , generous , and consoling , he began not only to believe it but to feel responsible for it , and he tried to atone . No one he dated ever accused him of being harsh , cruel , inattentive . They praised his patient listening , his lack of fear and cynicism in the face of love . They never accused him of anything ; still , they made him feel like a drugged coral snake , sleeping and beautiful , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock ticked and the effect of the drug subsided : with the first slow movement of his flesh , they would grab him and hold him on the table and , with an oyster fork , pierce his brain . <p> He began to wonder what he had done to his wives . The first had never remarried , had kept his last name , and for the past seventeen years had lived on Cape Cod with one man . The second had married again , and the third was dating . What cracks had he left in their hearts ? Did they love less now and settle for less in return , as they held onto parts of themselves they did not want to give and lose again ? Or  --  and he wished this  --  did they love more fully because they had survived pain , so no longer feared it ? This could not be true of his third wife : she would need a strong , gentle , and older man , someone like a father without the curse of incest . But perhaps the first two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so afraid of what he might have done to his daughters , even his stepdaughters whose lives he had entered when they were already in motion at a high and directionless speed , that he wondered about them as he did about the time and manner of his death : seldom , and with either terrible images or a silent blankness in his mind , like a window covered with shining white paint . With the women he loved after his last marriage , he started smoking again , and drinking more . <p> There were three of these women , separated by short intervals of pain , remorse , and despair . When he and the last one had their final quarrel  --  she threw the breadboard  --  he was nearly fifty-five , and he gave up on love , save the memory of it . Always his aim had been marriage . He had never entered what he considered to be an affair , something whose end was an understood condition of its beginning . But he had loved and wanted for the rest of his life women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts , but did not plan to keep him . He had known that about them , they had told him no lies about what they wanted , and he had persisted , keeping his faith : if he could not change their hearts , then love itself would . <p> As a young man , in his first marriage , he had done some erotic dabbling : one-night stands whose causes , he now knew , were alcohol , night , and vanity . This had only scratched his marriage : a little blood showed , nothing more ; for his wife had also fallen from grace , and in the same way . Theirs was a confessional marriage , and the purging of one and forgiving by the other deepened their love . The marriage ended much later , when their sexual mischief was far behind them , and Lee would never understand all of its ending anymore than he could explain why , on their first date in college , there was already enough love between them to engender the years it would take to have three children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love died when you were n't looking ; if you were n't looking . <p> At the restaurant he managed , a flaxen-haired young waitress flirted with him as a matter of course . This was Doreen Brodie . She was tall , and her limbs looked stronger than his . Some nights he had an after-hours drink with her , sitting at the bar , and her blue eyes and thin red lips aroused his passion and , more tempting , swelled his loneliness till it nearly brimmed over , nearly moved his arms to hold her . He did not touch her . She was younger than his children ; he was old , a marital leftover wearing a jacket and tie . <p> He had come to believe that only young women still trusted love , believed in it . He knew this could not be true , that it was the inductive reasoning of his bad luck , that he simply had not met resilient older women because they lived someplace else , or lived here in this little town but somehow had not crossed his path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't he the common denominator in three divorces ? Perhaps he was a sleeping snake . He slipped into masturbation and nearly always , afterward , felt he was too old for this , too , and what he wiped from his hand onto the sheet was his dignity . But sometimes on long afternoons when he could think of nothing but Doreen Brodie , of phoning her and asking her for a date , of having dinner with her , of making love with her , and so falling in love with her , he resorted to the dry and heartless caress of his hand ; then , his member spent and limp as his soul , he focused clearly on his life again , and he did not call Doreen . <p> He had married friends and went to their homes for dinner , or joined them at bars , but mostly he was alone in his apartment . So working nights , which had been an intrusion on his marriages and an interference with his dating , became a blessing . He started reading history or philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping a journal in spiral notebooks . He wrote every morning before breakfast : reflections on what he read , on people at the restaurant , sketches of the town and river and sky as he saw them on his walks . He wrote slowly , used a large dictionary , and took pleasure in precise nouns , verbs , and adjectives . He liked working with colors . He wrote nothing painful or erotic ; he did not want his children to feel pity or shame when they went through his effects after his death . For a summer and fall , a winter and part of a spring , Lee Trambath lived like this , till an April morning when he woke to the sound and smell of rain . <p> As he dressed he remembered that yesterday he had meant to buy coffee but , drawn by sunshine and a salty breeze from the sea , he had walked along the river , instead of to the store . He wanted to write about rain , try to put its smell and sound on paper . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a felt hat and went downstairs and outside . At once his face and throat and hands were pleasantly wet . Across the street was the gray river . He watched rain falling on it , and cars moving slowly , their headlights glowing . Then he walked to the end of the block and fumed left , onto the main street . He smelled rain and the sea . The grocery store was in the next block but his stride was slowing as he approached a newsstand with a kitchen for breakfast and lunch . In front of it , he stooped . Until nearly a year ago he had come here for breakfast , read newspapers , bought paperback boo , ks . Some time after he ducked the breadboard and backed out of her kitchen backed out of her dining and living rooms and front door , he had begun his rituals of abstinence : his journal ; his breakfast at home ; his study of America , hoping to find in that huge canvas perhaps one brushstroke to illuminate the mystery of his life ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light to see where he lived , smell it , touch it , listen to its sounds . Standing in the cool rain he lost his eagerness to write about it , but he kept its thrill . The rain on his face was like joyful tears , given him by the clouds ; he could not recall when he had last wept . Now a new excitement welled in him : that of a holiday , and he moved to the door and swung it open and went inside , looking first to his left at the counter for tobacco and boxed candy ' at that wall , and beyond it the shelves of magazines and racks of books , then he looked to his right at tables for two and four where people were eating , and a long counter facing a mirror . Seated at the counter were a policeman , a young couple looking at each other as they talked , a gray-haired man alone , and Doreen Brodie reading a newspaper . To her right were three empty stools . He walked between tables and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had never seen her anywhere save at the restaurant . She looked at the mirror opposite the counter , saw him there , smiled at his reflection , then turned the smile to him and said : " Well . What brings you out in the rain ? <p> He took off his hat and placed it on the counter and was about to say he was going to buy coffee , but he looked at Doreen 's blue eyes and said : " I woke to the sound of rain . It was the first thing I smelled . " From behind her a young waitress approached and he signaled with thumb and forefinger as if gripping a cup . " Some was splashing through the screen , onto the windowsill . I did n't close the window . I wanted to write about rain , but I was out of coffee . " He was unbuttoning his coat , removing his arms from its sleeves . " I 've been writing things . I wanted to write its smell and sound . Its feel in April . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stool . The waitress brought his coffee , and he stopped talking to pay . She was a young brunette wearing glasses , probably a year out of high school and waiting , happily enough , it seemed , for something to happen . He looked at Doreen 's eyes : " It would be a separate section ; the rain . Coming right after something I wrote yesterday about William James . He said that fear does n't cause running away . Running away causes fear . So if you hold your ground you 'll be brave . And that sadness does n't cause crying . Crying makes us sad . So we should act the way we want to feel . And he said if that does n't work , nothing else will anyway . " Then he blushed . " He was a philosopher . I 've been reading all kinds of things . " <p> " Does it work ? " <p> " What ? " <p> " Acting the way you want to feel . " <p> " Sometimes . " He looked away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt her eyes . <p> " What is it you want to feel ? " <p> Beneath his heart , wings fluttered . He looked at her eyes and the wings paused like a hawk 's , and glided . <p> " You , " he said , and they rushed in his breast , and someplace beneath them he felt the cool plume of a lie . " I want to feel you . " <p> The lie spread upward but light was in her eyes , and she was ' standing , was saying softly : " Let 's go . " <p> He stood and put on his coat and hat ; she had a black umbrella ; she left her newspaper on the counter and he followed her out the door . She opened the umbrella , held it between them , and he stepped under it . His arm touched hers ; perhaps it was the first time he had ever touched her . He went with her up the street , away from the river ; at the corner she stopped and faced traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her profile . Suddenly he felt the solidity of the earth beneath his feet . Were gravity and grave rooted in the same word ' In that moment , looking at her left eye and its long upturning lashes , her nose and lips , and the curve of her chin , he could have told her they must not do this , he was a waste of her time , her fertility . Then she turned to him , and her eyes amazed him ; he was either lost or found , he could not know which , and he surrendered . <p> The traffic light changed and they crossed the street and she led him down a brick alley between brick shops , then across a courtyard . His life was repeating itself , yet it felt not repetitious but splendid , and filled with grace . He lowered his eyes to rain moving on darkened bricks . God in heaven , he thought , if there is one , bless us . As a boy he was an Episcopalian . Then , with his first wife , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love for his children felt more spiritual than camel . Holding one in his arms , he felt connected with something ancient , even immortal . In the arms of his passionate wife he felt a communion he believed was the supreme earthly joy . It had ended and he had found it again with other wives and other women , and always its ending had flung him into a dark pit of finitude , whose walls seeped despair as palpable as the rain he walked in now , after too many years . <p> Doreen 's kiss dispelled those years . She gave it to him just across the threshold of her apartment , and he marveled at the resilience of nature . So many kisses in his lifetime , yet here he was , as though kissed for the first time on a front porch in summer in Dayton , Ohio . o plenitude , o spring rain , and new love . He did not see the apartment ; it was objects and shadows they moved through . Her unmade bed was box springs and a mattress on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat and clothes on the carpet with hers . He did not want it to end : he made love to her with his lips , his hands , his tongue . The muscles of her arms and stomach and legs were hard , her touch and voice soft ; he spoke her name , he called her sweet , he called her my lovely , he perspired , and once from his stomach came a liquid moan of hunger . Finally she rolled away from him , toward the bedside table , and opened a drawer ; he heard a tearing sound , and she sat up holding a golden condom . <p> " I have a vasectomy . " <p> " What a guy . I 've got an IUD . " <p> " I 've mostly been married . " <p> " You never know . He watched her hands as she placed the condom and unrolled it . Then she kneeled above him , guided him in , and said : " I had given up on you . " <p> " So had I. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman , and he closed his eyes and saw the ocean at night , and squid mating on its gentle swell , a documentary he watched on television one afternoon last winter ; sharks swam up and ate swaths of squid , but the others kept on , just kept on . Fucking and eating , he thought . They were why he left home , to marry and work , and here he was , over thirty years later , with a woman nearly as young as his first wife when passion drove them out of their parents ' homes and into the world , into a small apartment that was first an enclosure for their bed and second for a kitchen to prepare food in and a table to eat it on , and third for plumbing so they could bathe , and flush body waste . All vitality radiated from the bed , enough of it to give him the drive and direction to earn money and father children ; he fell in love with them , a love that was as much a component of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact it could only end with that flow 's ending . Now another flow was about to leave his body : the pleasure started in the muscles of his legs where masturbation never reached , and he saw the mockery of himself and his hand , and to rid his mind of this comparison he said her name . He said it again and again , naming her flesh and his delight but the truth was as loud as their quick breath . His passion spurted from him , was gone , a bit of sterile liquid in a condom , a tiny bit if it were blood . It was enough to stain a sheet , make a child . His children would smile if they knew of this , if he told them he had waked to rain but had no coffee , so  --  there was nothing to smile about here . He opened his eyes . Doreen 's were closed . <p> Soon he would soften inside her , and she was racing against the ebbing of his blood . He watched her face . Long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt the greater intimacy ; beyond a certain pitch of passion , the one receiving was isolated by muscles and nerves . He could have been watching her suffer pain ; he could have been watching her die . She cried out . Then she was still , her eyes open , her breath deep and slowing . Before moving away , she reached between them and pinched the condom 's opening . She took it with her , hanging from her fingers as she stood and smiled at him , and left the room . <p> He closed his eyes and listened to rain on the window . It saddened him now , all that rain and gray . He heard her footsteps in the hall , then soft on the carpet , and her lighter twice , and blown smoke ; she sat on the bed and he spread his fingers for the cigarette , then she lay beside him and placed a cool glass ashtray on his stomach . He opened his eyes and looked at hers and said : " What more could I ask ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was trying to do something . Learn something .

Her eyes were damp , and he knew from them what his own face showed . <p> " You know that look they have when it 's really behind them ' When they 've been dry for years ?

" Where ? " Looking at Doreen , he felt tears in his throat then his eyes and on his face . " I want that door , " he said , then he could not speak . His stomach tightened , his body jerked forward , and his head bowed as he wept . She took the ashtray and cigarette from him and tightly held him with one arm , and with a hand she petted his cheek , pressing it against hers ; she gently rocked him . <p> " You poor man , " she said . <p> He knew what she felt , at the core of her tender voice and touch .
