Prologue The bottle was dropped overboard on a warm summer evening , a few hours before the rain began to fall . Like all bottles , it was fragile and would break if dropped a few feet from the ground . But when sealed properly and sent to sea , as this one was , it became one of the most seaworthy objects known to man . It could float safely through hurricanes or tropical storms , it could bob atop the most dangerous of riptides . It was , in a way , the ideal home for the message it carried inside , a message that had been sent to fulfill a promise . Like that of all bottles left to the whim of the oceans , its course was unpredictable . Winds and currents play large roles in any bottles direction ; storms and debris may shift its course as well . Occasionally a fishing net will snag a bottle and carry it a dozen miles in the opposite direction in which it was headed . The result is that two bottles dropped simultaneously into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on opposite sides of the globe . There is no way to predict where a bottle might travel , and that is part of its mystery . This mystery has intrigued people for as long as there have been bottles , and a few people have tried to learn more about it . In 1929 a crew of German scientists set out to track the journey of one particular bottle . It was set to sea in the South Indian Ocean with a note inside asking the finder to record the location where it washed up and to throw it back into the sea . By 1935 it had rounded the world and traveled approximately sixteen thousand miles , the longest distance officially recorded . Messages in bottles have been chronicled forcenturies and include some of the most famous names in history . Ben Franklin , for instance , used message-carrying bottles to compile a basic knowledge of East Coast currents in the mid-1700s -- information that is still in use to this day . Even now the U.S. Navy uses bottles to compile information on tides and currents , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The most celebrated message ever sent concerned a young sailor in 1784 , Chunosuke Matsuyama , who was stranded on a coral reef , devoid of food and water after his boat was shipwrecked . Before his death , he carved the account of what had happened on a piece of wood , then sealed the message in a bottle . In 1935 , 150 years after it had been set afloat , it washed up in the small seaside village in Japan where Matsuyama had been born . The bottle that had been dropped on a warm summer evening , however , did not contain a message about a shipwreck , nor was it being used to chart the seas . But it did contain a message that would change two people forever , two people who would otherwise never have met , and for this reason it could be called a fated message . For six days it slowly floated in a northeasterly direction , driven by winds from a high-pressure system hovering above the Gulf of Mexico . On the seventh day the winds died , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Gulf Stream , where it then picked up speed , traveling north at almost seventy miles per day . Two and a half weeks after its launch , the bottle still followed the Gulf Stream . On the seventeenth day , however , another storm -- this time over the mid-Atlantic -- brought easterly winds strong enough to drive the bottle from the current , and the bottle began to drift toward New England . Without the Gulf Stream forcing it along , the bottle slowed again and it zigzagged in various directions near the Massachusetts shore for five days until it was snagged in a fishing net by John Hanes . Hanes found the bottle surrounded by a thousand flopping perch and tossed it aside while he examined his catch . As luck would have it , the bottle did n't break , but it was promptly forgotten and remained near the bow of the boat for the rest of the afternoon and early evening as the boat made its journey back to Cape Cod Bay . At eight-thirty that night -- and once the boat was safely inside the confines of the bay -- Hanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the sun was dropping lower in the sky , he picked it up but saw nothing unusual inside , and he tossed it overboard without a second glance , thereby insuring that the bottle would wash up along one of the many small communities that lined the bay . It did n't happen right away , however . The bottle drifted back and forth for a few days -- as if deciding where to go before choosing its course -- and it finally washed up along the shore on a beach near Chatham . And it was there , after 26 days and 738 miles , that it ended its journey . A cold December wind was blowing , and Theresa Osborne crossed her arms as she stared out over the water . Earlier , when she 'd arrived , there had been a few people walking along the shore . Now she found herself alone on the beach , and she took in her surroundings . The ocean , reflecting the color of the sky , looked like liquid iron , and waves rolled up steadily on the shore . Heavy clouds were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making the horizon invisible . In another place , in another time , she would have felt the majesty of the beauty around her , but as she stood on the beach , she realized that she did n't feel anything at all . In a way , she felt as if she were n't really there , as if the whole thing was nothing but a dream . She 'd driven here this morning , though she scarcely remembered the trip at all . When she 'd made the decision to come , she 'd planned to stay overnight . She 'd made the arrangements and had even looked forward to a quiet night away from Boston , but watching the ocean swirl and churn made her realize that she did n't want to stay . She would drive home as soon as she was finished , no matter how late it was . When she was finally ready , Theresa slowly started to walk toward the water . Beneath her arm she carried a bag that she had carefully packed that morning , making sure that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she carried with her , nor had she told them what she 'd intended to do today . Instead she 'd said that she was going Christmas shopping . It was the perfect excuse , and though she was sure that they would have understood had she told them the truth , this trip was something she did n't want to share with anyone . It had started with her alone , and that was the same way she wanted it to end . Theresa sighed and checked her watch . Soon it would be high tide , and it was then that she would finally be ready . After finding a spot on a small dune that looked comfortable , she sat in the sand and opened her bag . Searching through it , she found the envelope she wanted . Taking a deep breath , she slowly lifted the seal . In it were three letters , carefully folded , letters that she 'd read more times than she could count . Holding them in front of her , she sat on the sand and stared at them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was n't ready to look at those yet . Instead she continued to focus on the letters . He 'd used a fountain pen when he 'd written them , and there were smudges in various places where the pen had leaked . The stationery , with its picture of a sailing ship in the upper right hand corner , was beginning to discolor in places , fading slowly with the passage of time . She knew there would come a day when the words would be impossible to read , but hopefully , after today , she would n't feel the need to look at them so often . When she finished , she slipped them back into the envelope as carefully as she 'd removed them . Then , after putting the envelope back into the bag , she looked at the beach again . From where she was sitting , she could see the place where it had all started . She 'd been jogging at daybreak , she remembered , and she could picture that summer morning clearly . It was the beginning of a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she listened to the high-pitched squawking of terns and the gentle lapping of the waves as they rolled up on the sand . Even though she was on vacation , she had risen early enough to run so that she did n't have to watch where she was going . In a few hours the beach would be packed with tourists lying on their towels in the hot New England sun , soaking up the rays . Cape Cod was always crowded at that time of year , but most vacationers tended to sleep a little later , and she enjoyed the sensation of jogging on the hard , smooth sand left from the outgoing tide . Unlike the sidewalks back home , the sand seemed to give just enough , and she knew her knees would n't ache as they sometimes did after running on cemented pathways . She had always liked to jog , a habit she had picked up from running cross-country and track in high school . Though she was n't competitive anymore and seldom timed her runs , running was now one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered it to be a kind of meditation , which was why she liked to do it alone . She never could understand why people liked to run in groups . As much as she loved her son , she was glad Kevin was n't with her . Every mother needs a break sometimes , and she was looking forward to taking it easy while she was here . No evening soccer games or swim meets , no MTV blaring in the background , no homework to help with , no waking up in the middle of the night to comfort him when he got leg cramps . She had taken him to the airport three days ago to catch a plane to visit his father -- her ex -- in California , and it was only after reminding him that Kevin realized he had n't hugged or kissed her good-bye yet . " Sorry , Mom , " he said as he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her . " Love you . Do n't miss me too much , okay ? " Then , turning around , he handed the ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without looking back . She did n't blame him for almost forgetting . At twelve he was in that awkward phase when he thought that hugging and kissing his mom in public was n't cool . Besides , his mind was on other things . He had been looking forward to this trip since last Christmas . He and his father were going to the Grand Canyon , then would spend a week rafting down the Colorado River , and finally go on to Disneyland . It was every kid 's fantasy trip , and she was happy for him . Although he would be gone for six weeks , she knew it was good for Kevin to spend time with his father . She and David had been on relatively good terms since they 'd divorced three years ago . Although he was n't the greatest husband , he was a good father to Kevin . He never missed sending a birthday or Christmas gift , called weekly , and traveled across the country a few times a year just to spend weekends with his son . Then , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the summer , every other Christmas , and Easter break when school let out for a week . Annette , David 's new wife , had her hands full with the baby , but Kevin liked her a lot , and he had never returned home feeling angry or neglected . In fact , he usually raved about his visits and how much fun he had . There were times when she felt a twinge of jealousy at that , but she did her best to hide it from Kevin . Now , on the beach , she ran at a moderate clip . Deanna would be waiting for her to finish her run before she started breakfast -- Brian would already be gone , she knew -- and Theresa looked forward to visiting with her . They were an older couple -- both of them were nearing sixty now -- but Deanna was the best friend she had . The managing editor at the newspaper where Theresa worked , Deanna had been coming to the Cape with her husband , Brian , for years . They always stayed in the same place , the Fisher House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit his father in California for a good portion of the summer , she insisted that Theresa come along . " Brian golfs every day he 's here , and I 'd like the company , " she 'd said , " and besides , what else are you going to do ? You 've got to get out of that apartment sometime . " Theresa knew she was right , and after a few days of thinking it over , she finally agreed . " I 'm so glad , " Deanna had said with a victorious look on her face . " You 're going to love it there . " Theresa had to admit it was a nice place to stay . The Fisher House was a beautifully restored captain 's house that sat on the edge of a rocky cliff overlooking Cape Cod Bay , and when she saw it in the distance , she slowed to a jog . Unlike the younger runners who sped up toward the end of their runs , she preferred to slow down and take it easy . At thirty-six , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As her breathing eased , she thought about how she would spend the rest of her day . She had brought five books with her for the vacation , books she had been wanting to read for the last year but had never gotten around to . There just did n't seem to be enough time anymore -- not with Kevin and his never-ending energy , keeping up with the housework , and definitely not with all the work constantly piled on her desk . As a syndicated columnist for the Boston Times , she was under constant deadline pressure to put out three columns a week . Most of her coworkers thought she had it made -- just type up three hundred words and be done for the day -- but it was n't like that at all . To constantly come up with something original regarding parenting was n't easy anymore -- especially if she wanted to syndicate further . Already her column , " Modern Parenting , " went out in sixty newspapers across the country , though most ran only one or two of her columns in a given week . And because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a newcomer to most papers , she could n't afford even a few " off " days . Column space in most newspapers was extremely limited , and hundreds of columnists were vying for those few spots . Theresa slowed to a walk and finally stopped as a Caspian tern circled overhead . The humidity was up and she used her forearm to wipe the perspiration from her face . She took a deep breath , held it for a moment , then exhaled before looking out over the water . Because it was early , the ocean was still murky gray , but that would change once the sun rose a little higher . It looked enticing . After a moment she took off her shoes and socks , then walked to the water 's edge to let the tiny waves lap over her feet . The water was refreshing , and she spent a few minutes wading back and forth . She was suddenly glad she had taken the time to write extra columns over the last few months so that she would be able to forget work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did n't have a computer nearby , or a meeting to attend , or a deadline to meet , and it felt liberating to be away from her desk for a while . It almost felt as if she were in control of her own destiny again , as if she were just starting out in the world . True , there were dozens of things she knew she should be doing at home . The bathroom should have been wallpapered and updated by now , the nail holes in her walls needed to be spackled , and the rest of the apartment could use some touch-up painting as well . A couple of months ago she had bought the wallpaper and some paint , towel rods and door handles , and a new vanity mirror , as well as all the tools she needed to take care of it , but she had n't even opened the boxes yet . It was always something to do next weekend , though the weekends were often just as busy as her workdays . The items she bought still sat in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum , and every time she opened the closet door , they seemed to mock her good intentions . Maybe , she thought to herself , when she returned home . . . She turned her head and saw a man standing a little way down the beach . He was older than she , maybe fifty or so , and his face was deeply tanned , as if he lived here year-round . He did n't appear to be moving -- he simply stood in the water and let it wash over his legs -- and she noticed his eyes were closed , as if he were enjoying the beauty of the world without having to watch it . He was wearing faded jeans , rolled up to his knees , and a comfortable shirt he had n't bothered to tuck in . As she watched him , she suddenly wished she were a different kind of person . What would it be like to walk the beaches without another care in the world ? How would it be to come to a quiet spot every day , away from the hustle and bustle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer ? She stepped out a little farther into the water and mimicked the man , hoping to feel whatever it was that he was feeling . But when she closed her eyes , the only thing she could think about was Kevin . Lord knew she wanted to spend more time with him , and she definitely wanted to be more patient with him when they were together . She wanted to be able to sit and talk with Kevin , or play Monopoly with him , or simply watch TV with him without feeling the urge to get up from the couch to do something more important . There were times when she felt like a fraud when insisting to Kevin that he came first and that family was the most important thing he 'd have . But the problem was that there was always something to do . Dishes to be washed , bathrooms to be cleaned , the cat box to be emptied ; cars needed tune-ups , laundry needed to be done , and bills had to be paid . Even though Kevin helped a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was with school and friends and all his other activities . As it was , magazines went straight to the garbage unread , letters went unwritten , and sometimes , in moments like these , she worried that her life was slipping past her . But how to change all that ? " Take life one day at a time , " her mother always said , but her mother did n't have to work outside the home or raise a strong and confident yet caring son without benefit of a father . She did n't understand the pressures that Theresa faced on a daily basis . Neither did her younger sister , Janet , who had followed in the footsteps of their mother . She and her husband had been happily married for almost eleven years , with three wonderful girls to show for it . Edward was n't a brilliant man , but he was honest , worked hard , and provided for his family well enough that Janet did n't have to work . There were times when Theresa thought she might like a life like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that was n't possible . Not since David and she divorced . Three years now , four if you counted the year they were separated . She did n't hate David for what he had done , but her respect for him had been shattered . Adultery , whether a one-night stand or a long affair , was n't something she could live with . Nor did it make her feel better that he never married the woman he 'd been carrying on with for two years . The breach of trust was irreparable . David moved back to his home state of California a year after they separated and met Annette a few months later . His new wife was very religious , and little by little she got David interested in the church . David , a lifelong agnostic , had always seemed to be hungry for something more meaningful in his life . Now he attended church regularly and actually served as a marriage counselor along with the pastor . What could he possibly say to someone doing the same things he 'd done , she often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been able to control himself ? She did n't know , did n't care , really . She was simply glad that he still took an interest in his son . Naturally , once she and David had split up , a lot of her friendships ended as well . Now that she was no longer part of a couple , she seemed to be out of place at friends ' Christmas parties or backyard barbecues . A few friends remained , though , and she heard from them on her answering machine , suggesting that they set up a lunch date or come over for dinner . Occasionally she would go , but usually she made excuses not to . To her , none of those friendships seemed the way they used to , but then of course they were n't . Things changed , people changed , and the world went rolling along right outside the window . Since the divorce there had only been a handful of dates . It was n't that she was unattractive . She was , or so she was often told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulders , and straight as spider silk . Her eyes , the feature she was most often complimented on , were brown with flecks of hazel that caught the light when she was outside . Since she ran daily , she was fit and did n't look as old as she was . She did n't feel old , either , but when she looked in the mirror lately , she seemed to see her age catching up with her . A new wrinkle around the corner of her eye , a gray hair that seemed to have grown overnight , a vaguely weary look from being constantly on the run . Her friends thought she was crazy . " You look better now than you did years ago , " they insisted , and she still noticed a few men eyeing her across the aisle in the supermarket . But she was n't , nor ever would be , twenty-two again . Not that she would want to be , even if she could , unless , she sometimes thought to herself , she could take her more mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd probably get caught up with another David -- a handsome man who craved the good things in life with the underlying assumption that he did n't have to play by the rules . But dammit , rules were important , especially the ones regarding marriage . They were the ones a person was never supposed to break . Her father and mother did n't break them , her sister and brother-in-law did n't , nor did Deanna and Brian . Why did he have to ? And why , she wondered as she stood in the surf , did her thoughts always come back to this , even after all this time ? She supposed that it had something to do with the fact that when the divorce papers finally arrived , she felt as if a little part of her had died . That initial anger she felt had turned to sadness , and now it had become something else , almost a dullness of sorts . Even though she was constantly in motion , it seemed as if nothing special ever happened to her anymore . Each day seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them . One time , about a year ago , she sat at her desk for fifteen minutes trying to remember the last spontaneous thing she 'd done . She could n't think of anything . The first few months had been hard on her . By then the anger had subsided and she did n't feel the urge to lash out at David and make him pay for what he had done . All she could do was feel sorry for herself . Even having Kevin around all the time did nothing to change the fact that she felt absolutely alone in the world . There was a short time when she could n't sleep for more than a few hours a night , and now and then when she was at work , she would leave her desk and go sit in her car to cry for a while . Now , with three years gone by , she honestly did n't know if she would ever love someone again the way she had loved David . When David showed up at her sorority party at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took for her to know she wanted to be with him . Her young love had seemed so overwhelming , so powerful , then . She would stay awake thinking about him as she lay in her bed , and when she walked across campus , she smiled so often that other people would smile back whenever they saw her . But love like that does n't last , at least that 's what she found out . Over the years , a different kind of marriage emerged . She and David grew up , and apart . It became hard to remember the things that had first drawn them to each other . Looking back , Theresa felt that David became a different person altogether , although she could n't pinpoint the moment when it all began to change . But anything can happen when the flame of a relationship goes out , and for him , it did . A chance meeting at a video store , a conversation that led to lunch and eventually to hotels throughout the greater Boston area . The unfair thing about the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather the good parts about him . Being married to David was comfortable , like a bed she 'd slept in for years . She had been used to having another person around , just to talk to or listen . She had gotten used to waking up to the smell of brewing coffee in the morning , and she missed having another adult presence in the apartment . She missed a lot of things , but most of all she missed the intimacy that came from holding and whispering to another behind closed doors . Kevin was n't old enough to understand this yet , and though she loved him deeply , it was n't the same kind of love that she wanted right now . Her feeling for Kevin was a mother 's love , probably the deepest , most holy love there is . Even now she liked to go into his room after he was asleep and sit on his bed just to look at him . Kevin always looked so peaceful , so beautiful , with his head on the pillow and the covers piled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly on the go , but at night his still , sleeping figure always brought back the feelings she 'd had when he was still a baby . Yet even those wonderful feelings did n't change the fact that once she left his room , she would go downstairs and have a glass of wine with only Harvey the cat to keep her company . She still dreamed about falling in love with someone , of having someone take her in his arms and make her feel she was the only one who mattered . But it was hard , if not impossible , to meet someone decent these days . Most of the men she knew in their thirties were already married , and the ones that were divorced seemed to be looking for someone younger whom they could somehow mold into exactly what they wanted . That left older men , and even though she thought she could fall in love with someone older , she had her son to worry about . She wanted a man who would treat Kevin the way he should be treated , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the reality was that older men usually had older children ; few welcomed the trials of raising an adolescent male in the 1990s . " I 've already done my job , " a date had once informed her curtly . That had been the end of that relationship . She admitted that she also missed the physical intimacy that came from loving and trusting and holding someone else . She had n't been with a man since she and David divorced . There had been opportunities , of course -- finding someone to sleep with was never difficult for an attractive woman -- but that simply was n't her style . She had n't been raised that way and did n't intend to change now . Sex was too important , too special , to be shared with just anyone . In fact , she had slept with only two men in her life -- David , of course , and Chris , the first real boyfriend she 'd ever had . She did n't want to add to the list simply for the sake of a few minutes of pleasure . So now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a man anywhere in the foreseeable future , she wanted to do some things this week just for herself . Read some books , put her feet up , and have a glass of wine without the TV flickering in the background . Write some letters to friends she had n't heard from in a while . Sleep late , eat too much , and jog in the mornings , before everyone got there to spoil it . She wanted to experience freedom again , if only for a short time . She also wanted to shop this week . Not at JCPenney or Sears or places that advertised Nike shoes and Chicago Bulls T-shirts , but at little trinket stores that Kevin found boring . She wanted to try on some new dresses and buy a couple that flattered her figure , just to make her feel she was still alive and vibrant . Maybe she would even get her hair done . She had n't had a new style in years , and she was tired of looking the same every day . And if a nice guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd go , just to have an excuse to wear the new things she bought . With a somewhat renewed sense of optimism , she looked to see if the man with the rolled-up jeans was still there , but he had gone as quietly as he had come . And she was ready to go as well . Her legs had stiffened in the cool water , and sitting down to put on her shoes was a little more difficult than she expected . Since she did n't have a towel , she hesitated for a moment before putting on her socks , then decided she did n't have to . She was on vacation at the beach . No need for shoes or socks . She carried them with her as she started toward the house . She walked close to the water 's edge and saw a large rock half-buried in the sand , a few inches from a spot where the early morning tide had reached its highest point . Strange , she thought to herself , it seemed out of place here . As she approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was smooth and long , for one thing , and as she drew nearer she realized it was n't a rock at all . It was a bottle , probably discarded by a careless tourist or one of the local teens who liked to come here at night . She looked over her shoulder and saw a garbage can chained to the lifeguard tower and decided to do her good deed for the day . When she reached it , however , she was surprised to see that it was corked . She picked it up , holding it into better light , and saw a note inside wrapped with yarn , standing on its end . For a second she felt her heart quicken as another memory came back to her . When she was eight years old and vacationing in Florida with her parents , she and another girl had once sent a letter via the sea , but she 'd never received a reply . The letter was simple , a child 's letter , but when she returned home , she remembered racing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and sent a letter to her from where the bottle washed up . When nothing ever came , disappointment set in , the memory fading gradually until it became nothing at all . But now it all came back to her . Who had been with her that day ? A girl about her age . . . Tracy ? . . . no . . . Stacey ? . . . yes , Stacey ! Stacey was her name ! She had blond hair . . . she was staying with her grandparents for the summer . . . and . . . and . . . and the memory stopped there , with nothing else coming no matter how hard she tried . She began to pull at the cork , almost expecting it to be the same bottle she had sent , although she knew that could n't be . It was probably from another child , though , and if it requested a reply , she was going to send it . Maybe along with a small gift from the Cape and a postcard as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers slipped as she tried to open it . She could n't get a very good grip . She dug her short fingernails into the exposed cork and twisted the bottle slowly . Nothing . She switched hands and tried again . Tightening her grip , she put the bottle between her legs for more leverage , and just as she was about to give up , the cork moved a little . Suddenly renewed , she changed back to her original hands . . . squeezed . . . twisting the bottle slowly . . . more cork . . . and suddenly it loosened and the remaining portion slipped out easily . She tipped the bottle upside-down and was surprised when the note dropped to the sand by her feet almost immediately . When she leaned over to pick it up , she noticed it was tightly bound , which was why it slid out so easily . She untied the yarn carefully , and the first thing that struck her as she unrolled the message was the paper . This was no child 's stationery . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sailing ship embossed in the upper right hand corner . And the paper itself was crinkled , aged looking , almost as if it had been in the water for a hundred years . She caught herself holding her breath . Maybe it was old . It could be -- there were stories about bottles washing up after a hundred years at sea , so that could be the case now . Maybe she had a real artifact here . But as she scrutinized the writing itself , she saw that she was mistaken . There was a date on the upper left corner of the paper . July 22 , 1997 . A little more than three weeks ago . Three weeks ? That 's all ? She looked a little further . The message was long -- it covered the front and back sides of the paper -- and it did n't seem to request any reply of sorts . A quick glance showed no address or phone number anywhere , but she supposed it could have been written into the letter itself . She felt a twinge of curiosity as she held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , in the rising sunlight of a hot New England day , that she first read the letter that would change her life forever .
