<p> At the Young Collectors Tent , they 're on the lookout  --  for even more antique ice skates , African dresses , chopstick rests , lunch boxes , magnets , cowboy hats , snow globes , fossils , . . . <p> The Young Collectors Tent at the grand Smithsonian 150th Birthday Party on the Mall has n't even opened yet , but already the people are swarming in , friends and relatives and enthusiastic visitors , and everyone is talking at once , and the noise level is getting up to four jet engines . <p> " I 've always liked mechanical stuff , " shouts Stefan Osdene , " then I visited the Edison museum in Florida where I got a chance to see a lot of appliances . I said to myself , I have to collect these . I love ' em . " <p> Stefan picks up a 1911 porcelain-based electric toaster . " This one 's in the Smithsonian , " he says with forgivable pride , " and they have several models of Thomas Edison fans , too . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mark of the master : massive and a bit klutzy , but it works . The hand-wound armature is the size of an ankle shackle , built to last centuries . Like everything else on the table , it is polished to look like new . <p> I wow over a 1910 Hamilton-Beach mixer , a 1925 marshmallow toaster and a Little Wonder Whisk Broom Vacuum Cleaner , vintage 1920 , two feet long including the bag . " <p> I get pieces from collectors , museum auctions , and sometimes from flea markets , " says Stefan , 15 ; he has a commanding presence and is so self-possessed that he has his own business card . " <p> How many do you have ? " I ask , surveying the dozen or so spread out on the table . " <p> Oh , three to four thousand . " <p> Thousand ! <p> His father says the collection is in several rooms of their Richmond , Virginia , home . The family manages to accommodate it . " <p> We 're codependents , " he adds cheerfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all about numbers . Huge numbers . The sheer numberness of numbers . The Smithsonian 's Office of Elementary and Secondary Education posted notices and distributed 100,000 applications to find young people who collect things , and then invited about 60 of them to be part of the birthday party . Collecting , of course , is the Smithsonian 's thing , too . The tent will hold 40 tables , but so far only 25 have been installed . <p> It 's plenty for me . <p> Outside , the party scene is heating up as crowds queue for Thai or Cajun or down-home food and stand before giant TV screens to watch the dedication of the 150th Anniversary Bell . At dozens of tents and stages up and down the Mall , hundreds of presenters and performers are here to celebrate the Smithsonian 's wide-ranging interests . <p> Numbers . What would we do without them ? Certainly we believe with utter , often naive , faith in statistics these days . We believe in them probably more than we believe in anything . A fourth-grade class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Falls Church , Virginia , wanted to improve their sense of numbers and see what a million looked like . <p> " We thought we 'd collect a million of something , " says teacher Allyn Kurin . " We thought : Newspapers ? Too big . Pennies ? Too expensive . We brainstormed awhile , and finally we came up with paper dots from hole punchers . " So the 20 pupils roamed the neighborhood . They raided offices and schools , and made dots with punches in their own homes . Eventually they found a machine that punched a hundred at a time . <p> " Well , it was the counting that was hard , " Kurin says . " It went pretty slowly , one by one , up to about 200,000 . Then we got the dots from the large hole-punching machine . They were stuck together in clumps , and we were forced to find a new method of counting . We determined that 16,000 dots weigh 79 grams exactly , so we started counting them by weight . " Since starting the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million paper dots . They are exhibited in a large pretzel jar and several small pickle jars . <p> One pupil , Anh Pham , 11 , represents the class for the day . Mostly she stays busy keeping things from blowing away in the lovely cool breeze that sweeps through . Nervously , she eyes the visitors and their roving paws . <p> " Please do n't take the lid off that jar ! " she pleads . <p> It was boredom that inspired 10-year-old Gregory Lane of Lafayette Hill , Pennsylvania , to start collecting antique rulers . " My parents were always taking me to antique shops , and I got tired of waiting around . " So , he now has all kinds of wood and brass rulers  --  for carpenters and architects and shoemakers and hat fitters . Folding rulers , and rulers with calipers and levels and sliding rods and bars . <p> " My oldest ruler , about 150 years old , is from Sweden , " Greg tells me . " It has measurements based on the size of the king  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from elbow to fingertip ) , and his reach from nose to fingertip . " <p> He goes on to tell me that he 's expanding his collection to all kinds of linear measuring devices such as tape measures . " I 'm really keen on getting a lumberjack 's rule . You wrap it around the tree and it tells you how much lumber is inside . At least I think that 's how it works . " When I ask him how he hopes to find one , he explains that he has a Website , http : **34;534;TOOLONG . Oh . <p> Here is 10-year-old Shaun Plummer of Indian Head , Maryland , and his collection of plastic souvenirs from fast-food places . The table is absolutely crawling with them . How many ? " I do n't know , " says Shaun . But his aunt , who is here with his mother and grandmother , says he must have nearly a thousand . <p> As you might expect , there are many proud relatives in the tent . They 're the ones sitting on folding chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaun 's mother props up a bright yellow Dick Tracy , three inches high , who has lost his footing . " Of course this is n't quite a thousand , she says . We have more at home . " <p> By now the collections are stacked up two to a table . Charity Watkins , 10 , from Dale City , Virginia , has put out a row of rocks with a sign pointing to the smallest . The sign reads : " These are rocks I started collecting three years ago . They 're one of my favorite collections . The reason why I collect rocks is because they are all special to me in a certain way . I think that every rock has its own story . " <p> Abeer Beshir Abdalla is 14 but looks much older in her elegant gown of green and gold . She collects jewelry and clothes from the Middle East , and her table is covered with silver filigree necklaces and bedouin daggers . Some pieces are incredibly delicate and are lacquered onto boxes . " My first thing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was handed down by five generations of women to me . The bedouins sprinkle rose water down the aisle for the bride at a wedding . " <p> I see some magnificent silver ankle bracelets and a belt of Arabian vermeil coins . I see an intricately decorated silver bottle of kohl eyeliner , which is made of dried rose petals and applied with a small silver pencil dipped in rose water . " The stories behind these things are what interest me , " says Abeer . " I like to imagine where they came from . " <p> I find Meg Sandstrom , 10 , of Alexandria , Virginia , red-haired and freckled , standing by her display board of Russian medals . Russians love medals , she tells me : they have them for sports teams and schools and cities and all kinds of accomplishments and places . They exchange them as gifts . <p> She has hers divided into sports ( the Moscow Olympics are very big ) , aviation , politics ( many Lenins , a few Gorbachevs and one Kerensky , if I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cities , Egyptian figures from museums and so on . How many ? <p> " We counted close to 500 , " says her mother , Betsy Sandstrom , also with red hair and freckles . " I teach Russian , and when I go to Russia , Meg gives me her orders . We hope she 'll visit there one of these days . " <p> My head is beginning to spin . Here comes 8-year-old Larry Holmes of Suitland , Maryland , both hands full of dinosaurs , on the way to his table . There stands Dan Furnback of Point Pleasant , New Jersey , beside his 2,000 hockey cards , all neatly encased in glassine . His mother says he does n't trade or sell them : he ca n't bear to give up even one . <p> Emily Anne Behles , 10 , of Baltimore has Korean artifacts , dolls , books , juice cans , shoes , chopsticks . Gayatri Mani of Lanham , Maryland , has foreign money and coins , including some pre-British Indian coins , a 1780 Maria Theresa coin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painfully bent pencil that is an ad for a chiropractor . <p> And there are Patrick Godfrey 's small model cars and Matthew Johnson 's large model cars and John Monius ' replica John Deere tractors . And bonsai trees by Joshua and Noah Urban from Accokeek , Maryland , including a Japanese black pine , white serissa , Japanese hornbeam and rock cottoneaster , as well as fuchsia , wisteria and juniper . And Kate Johnson 's trolls , and Melissa Fox 's ceramic wall vases , and Brian Fox 's lunch boxes , and Anna Gatsos ' magnets and Julia Rausch 's wooden ice skates that surely date back to Hans Brinker or beyond . <p> I tell you , there is more stuff here  --  sheer stuff  --  than you can shake a stick at . What ? You say you collect sticks ? How many do you have ? <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Among the 60 kids invited to show their collections was Stefan Osdene , who has 3,000-plus appliances  --  fans , griddles , coffeepots , toasters , heaters , you name it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's treasures is an antique wedding veil from Saudi Arabia . <p> By Michael Kernan <p>
