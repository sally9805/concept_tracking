Thoughts on designing a sylvan path <p> A WOODLAND PATH , whether it leads through a small copse of trees or through acres of forest , has the power to create a mood that is unlike any other in the garden . While flower borders in full sun stimulate the eye with bright colors , a woodland path is relaxed and subdued . Where a lawn is sunny and open , a woodland path is shaded and enclosed . Such a path is a private area that offers a cool and contemplative respite . <p> A woodland path also offers the potential for remarkable scenic variety . It can lead you to a mossy boulder that is a natural garden in itself , then on to an expansive view of distant hills . One moment you might be in full shade , the next in a pool of light . A path offers seasonal changes as well . In spring azaleas , rhododendrons , and any number of shade-tolerant perennials planted along the path will add drama and color . In summer the path is shaded and cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In autumn brilliant red , orange , and yellow leaves hold overhead for a week or two and then fall to the ground . And in winter the woodland path leads walkers or cross-country skiers past evergreens and among gray-and-black tree trunks . <p> You do n't need to own acres of Woodland in order to create and enjoy a woodland path . My wife and I cleared one through a small copse on our property . We planted flowering shrubs to enclose the woods and ran the path between plantings of perennials , ferns , and smaller shrubs . Another good place for a path is through a narrow band of woods that separates one building or garden space from another . And a path need not be heavily planted . You could simply clear a path through a small woodland that leads past existing landmarks , such as unusual trees or shrubs , clearings , streams , or views . Whatever the approach , a woodland path leads to an increased appreciation of the beauty and peace inherent in a woodland . <p> Three paths that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . The smallest is the one on Our property in southern Vermont ( USDA Zone 4 ) . It cuts through a 70- by 30-foot area of deciduous trees bordered by a section of lawn to the north and a stone wall and meadow to the south . The second path I helped make is within five acres of mature beech , maple , and oak woodland located nearby . The third path wends its way through a 100-foot-wide strip of steeply sloping woodland of mature white birch , hemlock , and maple that separates a main house from its guest house on a New Hampshire hilltop . <p> A woodland walk is best designed among the trees not on paper , because points of interest inherent in the woods  --  natural contours , rocks , trees , and water  --  provide clues to the direction the most varied path should take . The first points of interest to consider are those existing plants and rocks . In the five-acre woodland , for example ; I found three 20- to 30-foot long lichen- and moss-covered rock outcroppings with ferns growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature beech trees that suggested gateways or passageways ; and a few rotted stumps that were hosts to natural miniature gardens of mosses , ferns , and spleenworts . <p> Other points to consider are existing or potential views . On the New Hampshire hilltop , for , example , I found that minimal , clearing would open up a vista through beech trees and hemlocks to an 18th-century home on an adjacent hilltop . <p> Finally , look for pockets or areas of soil that are relatively root-free , for these are places where new plants can easily be introduced . If you 're lucky , you 'll find a variety of soil conditions , among those areas , for with variety of soil type comes the potential for a broad range of plants . <p> As you walk through woodlands looking for these , points of interest , carry a roll of bright-orange forester 's tape with which to mark them . Once you have explored the entire area , go back to the outside of the woods to consider the starting and ending points of the path . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a door in the house , an existing pathway , areas of lawn or breaks that exist or can be made in stone walls . For an endpoint , a path should offer a specific destination such as a bench . <p> Once you know where the landmarks are in the woods and where the starting and ending points will be , you can begin to determine the exact layout off the patch . Be careful not to be slavish in following the perimeter of the property , for you can end up with too many stretches of long , straight path . Curves and turns add suspense and draw the Walker on . <p> Changes in direction are one way to vary the nature of a path , Changes in dimension are another . The trunks or branches of trees and shrubs on either side of the path can funnel closer and closer and then suddenly widen ; tree branches above can also be left as is or pruned to create different effects . I once high-pruned one group of 10 or so beeches 30 feet up , thus creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along that path , I pruned limbs to create an arch as low as seven feet , creating a more intimate feeling . <p> Distance between you and a point of interest is yet another source of variety . After passing within two or three feet of an intimately planted rock outcropping , you could come around a turn in the path to find yourself in a wide clearing , at the end of which is a dramatic view through the woods . <p> ONCE A PATH is roughly laid out with tapes , you can begin clearing . I divide the work into three phases : First , I work its length , removing undergrowth and saplings that either can be uprooted by hand and shovel or cut with a handsaw . <p> Next , if it is necessary , I work the length of the path with a chain saw , removing dead trees and taking out larger ones that either impede the smooth running , of the path , block views , or confuse the image of more satisfying trees . Clearing small trees from the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reveal a vast sculpture . <p> Finally , I make a third pass with pruning shears and a handsaw to finetune the path . In one instance , I cleared between the trunks of several 150-year-old maple trees to open a view into a sheep meadow ; at another point , I cut a window in saplings to frame a view of a seasonal freshet . I also cut small saplings from along an old moss , stone wall , leaving the tumbled s ones just as they were . Because the woodland in southern Vermont offered so many varied images , this one six-hour process completed the path . Someday I might add plantings , but for the moment , the path looks good just as it is . <p> Other paths may not have that inherent appeal , so the next step is to decide where to introduce additional plants to provide areas of surprise or intimacy , screening or drama . New plantings need to look as natural as possible . To make them appear natural , I place them near existing landmarks such as boulders and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siting new plantings . In many cases , I have found that woodland soil has been exhausted by ferocious competition for water and nutrients among existing trees and shrubs . In such cases , I look for areas where the ground is not too rooty in relatively open spaces , in places near large boulders or rock outcroppings where roots have not yet penetrated , and in places where tree trunks have decomposed . I excavate the existing soil to a depth of a foot or more and then replace it with a mixture of one part topsoil , one part compost , and one part peat . Lining the bottom of the hole first with woven plastic weed-barrier cloth helps keep the soil pockets free of tree roots . <p> For relatively root-free areas where the soil is not wholly depleted but needs enrichment , I fork the soil and then amend it . In clay soil I use one part sand , one part compost , and one part topsoil ; in sandy soil I use one part topsoil and one part compost . <p> I have also planted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight- to 10-inch layer of a soil-compost-peat mixture on top of the woodland floor and planting directly in that . Particularly tough plants  --  hostas , Christmas ferns ( Polystichum acrostichoides ) , maidenhair ferns ( Adianturn pedatum ) , and Woodsia species , for example  --  can get a good hold on the soil this way before the surface roots of more aggressive trees get into the soil . <p> Plants introduced along a woodland path should complement the beauty of the natural woodland . In one path , for example , I wanted woodland plants that would look natural and yet offer different points of interest throughout the year , so I planted shrubs and hardy perennials that could be found growing wild in the area . At the starting point , along the curves , and at the endpoint , I planted one , three , or five witch hazels ( Hamamelis mollis ) . Their yellow flowers appear in late winter , and their handsome foliage adds a clear yellow to the image in autumn . In wetter areas I planted clumps of male and female winterberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tips of 10- to 12-foot upright branches provide an accent from late autumn into early winter . I then underplanted these shrubs and the naturally occurring ones with a combination of trilliums , bloodroots ( Sanguinaria canadensis ) , trout lilies ( Eryth ronium species ) , Christmas ferns , and foam flowers ( Tiarella cordiafolia ) to provide spring color and full-season foliage texture and color contrast . This was a simple planting that two of us finished in a morning , thus completing the path . <p> Larger paths may take several years to plant and mature , find that process , too , is part of the pleasure In our woodland my wife and I planted an informal screen of delicious shrubs to visually separate the lawn from the path . At the entrance to the path we set out a single , wayfaring tree ( Viburnum lantana ) . This drought-tolerant shrub matures at six to seven feet and blooms white in early June . Bright-red berries follow shortly thereafter . Leaving a break of six or eight feet to leave room for maturing plants , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle some six feet across . This shrub is airier and more upright tha0 V. lantana and forms an eight- to 10-foot clump that blooms white in late spring . Next I planted five March-blooming witch hazels ( Hamamelis Xintermedia Diana ' ) in an irregular drift that broke up what could have become a too-perfect curve that followed the path exactly . This rangy , open-branched shrub blooms red in March and carries clear-yellow leaves in autumn . Next came one lily-of-the-valley shrub ( Enkianthus campanulatus ) . It blooms in late spring and has a growth habit that is more angular and upright . Thus it acts as a foil to the neighboring witch hazels and the next grouping of three sweet pepper bush plants ( Clethra alnifolia ) . These lump-forming shrubs mature at six Feet and carry highly fragrant blooms in August . I planted all of them in deep , compost-enriched soil ; when nature , they will form a natural-looking six- to 10-foot screen . <p> To mark the entrance to the walk , I set two seven-foot granite fence posts next to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the walkway . I then planted Hosta Frances Williams ' , interplanted with the daffodil Louise de Coligny ' , around one post . Near the other I chose plants that would provide color in early spring when many of the shrubs in the shrub screen were still in bud : a young Magnolia stellata , underplanted with Bellis perennis . For later color I planted Phlox stolonifera ( Bruce 's White ' and Blue Ridge ' ) and Dicentra formosa Alba ' , in the midst of which rises the upright Hosta Krossa Regal ' . Along the stone walkway I gathered combinations of other perennial plants that would offer color at various times of he year but would primarily create an interplay of foliage textures , shapes , and colors : Bergenia cordifolia , Hosta sieboldiana Elegans ' , Epimedium youngianum Niveum ' and E. Xrubrum , Pulmonaria angustifolia , Sanguinaria canadensis Flore Pleno ' , Dicentra spectabilis and its white form Alba ' , and the blue Phlox divaricata . <p> At the other end of the walkway , I planted a young Stewartia pseudocamellia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chose the stewartia , a small tree because it would form an upright , albeit living , counterpart of the granite fence post on the other side of the path . Furthermore , it would appreciate the cover provided by the neighboring trees in winter and would , as it matured , provide exquisite camellialike flowers and extraordinary rust-colored exfoliating bark . I then chose perennial groundcovers that would offer foliage interest and contrast with the stewartia and the pepperbushes : royal ferns ( Osmunda regalls ) and lower perennials such as Phylox stolonifera , Bergenia cordifolia , and Hosta Blue Cadet ' . <p> Because our woodland path is so small , we were able to set steppingstones the length of it . The problem of covering longer paths is more easily solved . Let autumn leaves fall on them . They form ; good mulch and an attractive , natural covering . <p> Maintenance of a path is simple . Each autumn cut back shoots or saplings that arise from stumps of trees and remove branches that have grown into the walkway . Mulch planted areas in fall with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring spread a l0-l0-10 fertilizer on those same areas . Only a minimum of weeding is necessary . <p> A well-designed and planted path provides years , even decades , of pleasure . And since it is relatively quiet , it offers a good place four contemplation . Yet at the same time it is dynamic and continuously changing with the weather , with the seasons , with passing daylight , and with the growth of the plants . Because of these changes , the mood and feeling in a woodland walk are always different , thus ever engaging our imagination . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Hostas , ferns , and other shade-tolerant perennials can be planted along the edges of a path to complement a woodlands natural beauty . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : A woodland path offers plenty of scenic variety throughout the seasons . In winter ( left ) , it provides a serene place to ponder snow-laden trees . There are also ways for the gardener to create variety in such a path . Occasional clearings can open windows to distant vistas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . <p> By Gordon Hayward <p> <p> Vermont landscape designer Gordon Hayward is a frequent contributor to this magazine . <p>
