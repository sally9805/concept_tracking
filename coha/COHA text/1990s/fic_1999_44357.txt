Sometimes publicity is the last thing you want-but hard to avoid . Photograph <p> We were exploring a sea cave on the west side of the island when the alarm went off . I felt it in the middle of my head , like a new center of consciousness blossoming into existence next to mine . I suppose that 's exactly what it was , since I was little more than a projection myself The mass eliminator that provided my quasi-corporeal existence had merely spliced the new sit nal into my data stream . Telepathy , of a sort . It was just one more in a long string of odd new abilities I 'd acquired since becoming an astral astronaut . The cave was only partially flooded . We stood on a rocky ledge maybe thirty feet in , at the point where the seaweeddraped cavern split ; one branch reaching up into the headland and the other beneath the waves . I had been about to dive into the underwater passage to see how far it extended , but I paused with my hands outstretched and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I feel it too , " said Tilbey . He held the coil of rope I had planned to pull along behind me so Kylona and Etinitu-two of Islandia 's lovely native women  --  could follow if there was anything on the other side worth diving to see . Liam and Yavetra were back at camp . He did n't like caves , and she did n't want to come without him . The feeling in my head grew more distinct , then an image formed as our starship 's autopilot fed its long-range telescope signal directly into my mind . The dark cave wall , speckled with reflections from the sunlit waves beyond its mouth , became a field of stars against the backdrop of space . And in the center of it a fuzzy blue blob sported a pencil-thin line of white-hot flame . There was only one thing that could be : someone from Earth had followed us out here to Alpha Centauri . " How far away are they ? " I asked aloud . The autopilot filters my data flow for questions even if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate them from idle thoughts . " What ? " said Kylona , following my gaze to the wall and seeing nothing there . " Five light-minutes , " said the autopilot , its synthetic voice flat and emotionless in my mind . " What ? " I did some quick mental math . " That 's only . . three hours flight time away . " " Who are you talking to ? " Kylona asked me . I blinked away the starfield and looked over at her , standing on the slippery rocks at the edge of the water without so much as a strand of seaweed for clothing . Tilbey 's sweetie , Etinitu , stood beside her , equally nude and equally puzzled . I 'd grown used to the sight of them ; dark hair falling straight to their shoulders , skin tanned dark brown , bodies shaped by a lifetime of exercise and good nutrition-but now I saw them again as if for the first time . Technologically primitive , but intelligent , lovely-and loving . For a couple of milky-white dead guys from another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , much less care for us . After all , there were plenty of native men to choose from . I 'd assumed they were mostly interested in us for the novelty , and I 'd expected it to wear off any time , but they 'd been our steady companions ever since we 'd landed . " The Spook 's autopilot , " I told them . " It found another incoming ship . " " Oh . " They knew what that meant . In the months since Tilbey , Liam , and I had arrived we had told them about Earth and UNASA and how the government 's aerospace authority had tried to steal our experimental starship from us before we could leave . We knew UNASA would figure out the technology on their own and follow us here ; we just had n't expected them to arrive without warning . Looking out the cave entrance toward the bright circle of ocean beyond , Tilbey said , " How did you let them get that close ? Where have you been looking for the last month ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a non-self-aware program , " I have been monitoring Sol space continuously since ordered to do so . The drive flame started only two and a half minutes ago . " Tilbey looked at me . " The bastards coasted in . But if they just now lit the drive , they 'll overshoot . Unless . . . how hard are they decelerating now ? " " One hundred and ten gravities . " He whistled softly . aI guess they 've made a few improvements to the design . " Our ship , the Spook , could do fifty gs under full thrust , and that was only because we 'd used Tilbey 's mass eliminator to wring the inertia out of everything but the fuel . Even the passengers-us  --  had been Tilbey-ized . Unfortunately that meant we 'd had to leave our corporeal bodies behind , so we existed only as " magnetically enhanced post-vivo standing waves , " and our lack of substance meant we had trouble hanging on under heavy acceleration . If we were n't in containment fields when we lit the drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of the ship . Presumably the same restrictions applied to the UNASA ship , but they apparently had a better stardrive and better containment fields for the crew . I wondered what other new and improved gadgets they had brought with them . " I assume you 've shown this to Liam , " I said . " He is getting the shuttle ready , " the autopilot replied . " Good . Tell him to come pick us up . " I turned to Kylona and Etinitu , " We 've got to go . " Kylona frowned . " To camp , or ... ? " " Orbit . " She looked stricken . " Will you be back ? " " We 'll try , " I said . " But I ca n't promise anything . We do n't know what we 'll be facing up there . " That was n't entirely true . UNASA had n't been happy about letting us slip from their grasp , so we figured they 'd be carrying a grudge when they caught up with us . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score for defying their court injunction , but that was no doubt part of their agenda . We had n't brought any weapons with us . UNASA never went anywhere without . The Spook would be a sitting duck for the first triggerhappy jetjock who wanted to take a shot at it , and when the ship blew , the mass eliminators that kept us alive would go with it . We would vanish like dreams , leaving Islandia wide open for Earth 's worst representatives to plunder . Somehow , we had to convince them not to shoot . I gave Kylona a hug and a long kiss . " We 'll do what we can . But if we do n't come back , well . . " What do you say at a moment like that ? " It 's been fun " ? " I love you madly " ? " I 'm sorry we got you into this stupid mess , but if we had n't we never would have met in the first place " ? Nothing really covered what I was truly thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't just go on being paradise . She did n't like the situation any more than I did , but there was n't much she could do about it , either Her people did n't have space flight , nor even radio . If we did n't come back , they would never know what happened to us . We knew what would happen to them , though . The odds that the UNASA crew would land on their particular island were vanishingly small , but eventually Earth would send real , live colonists , and within a century they would overrun the planet . Since we had made it possible for them to get here , we had to at least try to prevent it . That was part of why we were still on Islandia . The other part stood there in front of us , looking worried and beautiful at the same time . We had n't planned to end our explorations at the first planet we reached , but we had n't expected to find it full of Amazon temptresses , either . This had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had welcomed us with open arms , which , considering how the women welcomed us , was probably the most amazing thing of all . The Islandians had won Liam over completely . He had already decided to move his mass eliminator down from the Spook and stay here as the planet 's guardian angel when Tilbey and I decided to go . He had n't done it yet because we had n't gotten around to building a separate power source for him , but we were working on it . I figured Tilbey and I would move on eventually , but neither of us were ready to break away just yet either . Now I sort of wished we had . Liam had been a Marine before he 'd been a ghost ; he 'd seen plenty of combat . I 'd been born after the war and I did n't want to learn . And Tilbey . . . well , if you gave Tilbey a gun , you 'd want to make sure he was on another planet before you gave him the batteries . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the cave , much louder than the waves crashing on the rocks outside . " Liam 's here , " I said . " Come on . " I took the rope from Tilbey and climbed over the wet stones to the cave 's mouth , then angled up the rock face toward the flat ground a few dozen feet above the high tide line . Tilbey and I could have lowered our coupling constant-the degree with which our ghostly bodies interacted with real matter  --  and swum straight up through the cave 's ceiling , but it would n't have been nice to leave Kylona and Etinitu to climb up the hard way . Besides , I hate sliding through solid matter . It feels creepy and it 's easy to get disoriented . We probably should have done it that way anyway . Tilbey got almost to the top before he slipped on a wet boulder and tumbled all the way back into the surf . Kylona and Etinitu and I watched as he bounced from rock to rock like a rag doll , yelling " Oof ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then I threw him the rope and hauled him back up again . He was n't injured , of course . We 'd programmed our mass eliminators not to allow any permanent damage to our projected bodies . It would have been funny if the end of the world had n't been drawing closer while he made his pratfall . Our landing craft , a twenty-foot-tall egg on spindly legs , waited in a steaming patch of scorched ground atop the cliff . A couple of small bushes off to the side still crackled with open flame , so while Tilbey dusted himself off I went over and stomped them out . It hurt like hell , but it was no more dangerous than Tilbey 's fall . Leaving black footprints on the bare rock , I limped back to the lander and climbed the ladder up one of the legs to the airlock . By the time I reached the top , my feet hardly tingled . I suppose that invincibility is what had lulled us into leaving our mass eliminators in orbit . Now I felt even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a couple million miles per hour Liam had presumably said his goodbyes to Yavetra back at camp . I 'd already said goodbye to Kylona in the cave . Tilbey took his time kissing Etinitu at the foot of the ladder , then climbed up after me . As I stepped into the airlock , Kylona waved and said , " Be careful . " It was all very melodramatic , and I went on into the lander with a heavy heart , certain that we would never see our beautiful dark-haired lovers again . So it was kind of an anticlimax when the radio came to life just after we 'd lifted off and a friendly female voice said , " Hello ! Anybody home down there ? " " Do n't answer , " said Liam , slapping Tilbey 's hand away from the radio controls . " Why not ? " asked Tilbey . " I want to get well away from here before I give them an easy way to track us . " That made sense . So we waited a few minutes while Liam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he could find until we were a couple hundred miles away from our home island . We took the time to climb into our high-acceleration magnetic confinement cages and lower the coupling constant-and with it our simulated mass  --  so by the time we reached the middle of a large stretch of ocean we were ready for high boost . Liam said , " Hang onto your hats , " as he took us up out of the atmosphere at thirty gs and headed for the Spook . " Hello , calling Earth vessel , " came the woman 's voice again . " At least I assume you 're the Earth ship . Yours is the only drive flame besides mine in the whole system . Can you hear me ? " Liam switched on the radio , using the holographic controls that let him interact with the ship even when he was nearly insubstantial . " We hear you . What do you want ? " " What do I want ? " she asked , her voice full of surprise . " Good grief , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It had been years for us , but she had evidently boosted closer to lightspeed to take advantage of time dilation . She got no sympathy from Liam . " Nobody here but us ghosts , " he told her . She was silent a moment , then she said , " This is n't quite the welcome I was expecting . " " Sorry , " Liam said . " Welcome to Alpha Centauri . Now go home . " " What 's the matter with you ? " " What 's the matter with us ? I 'll tell you what 's the matter with us . We barely escaped the UN on Earth , and now you 've come out here to harass us again . You 're a bunch of thieves and cutthroats who think it 's perfectly acceptable to " appropriate " anything you want for the good of the people . " Well , you 're not taking Alpha Centauri . " " Uh , Liam , should we be antagonizing them ? " I whispered as soon as he let off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred-g drive . " " The best defense is a good offense , " he replied , and so saying he veered the lander around until we were aimed straight at the UNASA ship instead of the Spook . " If I can convince " em I mean business , maybe they 'll high-tail it before we have to ram " em . " Tilbey looked wide-eyed . " Wait a minute . Nobody said anything about ramming anybody . " The woman replied , " You 'd have a good point if I was from the Security Arm , but I 'm not . I 'm from Exploration . I came out here to see why you suddenly stopped transmitting after you got here , not to take anything from you . " Liam looked at Tilbey and me . We both shrugged . He turned on the radio again and said , " There 's just one of you ? " " Yes . " " I wish I knew if I could trust you . " " Give me a chance , " came the reply . Liam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our engine was fairly simple ; it just heated up a fluid and spat it out the back at high velocity . We used molten lead on the trip out , since it acted as shielding as well as a compact source of mass , but now we were using water . It was a little more finicky under high-g thrust , but we had a lot of it to play with . I looked at the navigation display . Our two ships were headed straight for each other . The UNASA ship was still doing a good fraction of light speed , and we were building up to half a percent ourselves . A collision at this velocity would leave nothing but plasma . Our ghost generators were on the Spook ; if the magnetic pulse did n't overload them , we could conceivably survive it . The UN pilot could n't , but she would never let us hit her . She had a hotter drive ; she could dodge us easily . Then I saw what Liam was doing with the fuel . " You 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " em , " he said . " Just before we get there . That ought to create a cloud big enough to hit her even if she swings wide . " At the speed we would be moving by the time we reached the UN ship , even water vapor would hit like a brick wall . " What do you say ? " asked the UN pilot . " Can we at least meet and talk this over ? " " What would you say , " Liam asked right back , " if I told you the planet 's already inhabited ? " " It is ? Great ! What are they like ? " " I 'm just asking a hypothetical question , " he replied . " Assume they 're bugeyed monsters that drip slime and eat anything that moves . Would you tell Earth ? " " I do n't know , " she replied . " I 'd look around first . Try to talk to them . Try to understand them before I decided anything . " " Hmm , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what if they 're incredibly advanced beings with technology we 've never even dreamed of . Would you tell Earth then ? " She thought about it a moment . gI still do n't know . Maybe , maybe not . It 's never pretty when a high-tech civilization meets a low-tech one . Especially if you 're on the low end of the scale . " " Bingo , " said Liam . " Final question . What would you do if the situation were reversed ? " She was quiet even longer , but when she came back on she said , " That 's it , is n't it ? You 're afraid we 'll destroy them . " " Just answer the question , " said Liam . Our ships were closing fast . She noticed it , too . " Hey , you 're going to overshoot if you keep coming at that speed . " " Answer the question , " Liam said . He held his finger over the holographic button that would vent the fuel tank . She knew what we were doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was an edge of desperation in her voice as she said , " I do n't know what I 'd do . Are we talking Cortez and Montezuma , or Perry and Japan ? " " How about Cook and Hawaii ? " he asked . " Who 's Cook ? " " Wrong answer . " His finger inched closer to the button . " What , you want me to lie ? " She started talking fast . " Look if there 's a good reason to keep it secret , I 'll keep it secret , all right ? But I 'll have to see for myself what 's going on here and make up my own mind . I promise to be reasonable , but that 's the best I can do . " Liam frowned , then pulled his hand away from the vent button . " You should know that we can still kill you any time we want to . It just would have been easiest this way . " He gave us a sideways nudge with the thrusters , and moments later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It took a couple more hours for us to rendezvous in orbit around Islandia . The UNASA pilot , Ilex Smith , parked her ship in a polar orbit diametrically opposite the Spook , which gave her protection from any weapons we might have on board . It incidentally protected the Spook from her , so we did n't tell her she 'd have been just as safe right next to it . She let us pull alongside her ship in our lander and come across . She opened the airlock for us and Tilbey and I went inside , but Liam went through the wall beside it . " Could be a magnetic trap in there , " he said . There was n't . We stepped out of the airlock no worse for wear , and a moment later Liam slid through the wall , accompanied by a flicker of lights as he accidentally shorted out the wiring . " Watch that , " said the ghost woman who hovered before us . " We 're a long ways from repairs . " Tell me about it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd burned out by accidentally getting a little too intimate with it . Ilex was just under six feet tall , slender , and shapely . Her white hair fell halfway down her back . I had to look close to realize she was a ghost ; she had turned up her coupling constant to maximum so she could wear clothing , and she had chosen bright colors to offset the pale white of her face and hands . " Excuse us for not dressing up , " I said . We were naked as jaybirds , and had been since we 'd died . It had never embarrassed me until now . She did n't say much at first , just sized us up . Then she shook her head and said , " I hope you 're not trying to impress me , " cause if you are , I do n't swing that way . " I do n't know why it bothered me . I already had a girlfriend . If Ilex liked women , too , why should I care ? Heck , Kylona and Etinitu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the campfire at night , and if that did n't bother me then nothing should . But I found myself taken aback by Ilex 's forwardness . She was friendly enough . She gave us a tour of her entire ship , which was a marvel of efficiency . Ours was a modified cargo rocket , but hers was built from scratch for deep space . Small and sleek and packed with everything a person might need on a long trip away from civilization-it looked like my parents " motor home back in the days when you could fly them into national parks . Tilbey was fascinated by her mass eliminator . It was a third the size of ours , and had its own nuclear generator . And it had a two-way interface that would let her transfer her mind back into a living body . " You could grow a clone and get your body back , " Tilbey said incredulously . She nodded . " I could . Some of the rich people on Earth are doing that . Other ghosts just rent bodies when they need them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio broadcasts once we reached Alpha Centauri . Now I realized the place was liable to be unrecognizable by the time we got back . There were two other mass eliminators on board . Liam worried that they were hiding more crewmembers in limbo , but Tilbey examined them and assured us they were just backups in case the first one failed . Ilex had n't brought a body  --  even frozen , it would n't have survived a hundred gs of acceleration-but she had tissue samples and an artificial womb for growing a clone and a freezer to keep it in when she did n't need it . And of course she had backups of those , too . She had a couple of weapons : a particle beam that could cook a ship from a million miles away , and a communications laser that could do the same job at ten times the distance . Neither one was powered up , nor had they been when she arrived in the system , if we could believe her computer log . " Satisfied ? " she said at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm not hiding anything . Now when are you going to show me what you 're hiding down below ? " We dithered a bit , but there did n't seem any reason to put it off . If we were n't going to show her , we should have killed her when we had the chance . So we climbed into the lander and headed back to the island we 'd come to call home . Kylona and her friends were overjoyed to see us again . They threw a feast even bigger than the one they 'd thrown when we first arrived . The natives welcomed Ilex like an old friend , and she was delighted to find that some of them had learned English . " I understand now why you 're so protective of them , " she told us that evening as we sat near the campfire and told stories about our travels . " If people on Earth knew this was here , they 'd come running to put up condos . " " Or missions , " I said . She shivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're right . There 's no way missionaries could let people this happy live in peace . " " So you 'll keep the secret ? " She thought about it for a while , then shook her head . zI do n't know . It 's hard to believe there 's no way to keep these people safe without lying about them . And there 's so many questions to ask ! Like why are there people here at all ? " " We wondered that , too , " I said . " They 've got a legend about a big ship that brought them here from another is land thousands of years ago , but we have no idea who it might have been . " Tilbey said , " It may be too late to hide Islandia from Earth anyway . We screwed up and sent a " Nya-nya , look what we found " message before we realized the planet was inhabited , so they already know it 's here . How much did you tell them on your way in ? " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've arrived yet . I had plenty of time to wonder why you went silent after you got here , so I decided to take a look around before I made my report . If I decide not to , they 'll probably think I died in transit . " Liam tossed a knobby seed pod into the fire . " Or they 'll think hostile natives killed us all and send a battleship next time . It would be better if you told them you got here and found nothing . Tell them we lied when we reported a habitable planet , and there 's no sign of us now either . They 'll think we did it to spite them and then took off for another star She watched sparks from the burning seeds rise into the night sky . I said , " And if you give them a good video tour of the rest of the planetary system-minus Islandia-that might assuage their curiosity enough to keep them away for a while longer " " We can hope , " said Liam . Ilex laughed . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are a lot of people willing to trade their bodies for a seat on a starship , but there are n't that many who are qualified for the job . The ships do n't grow on trees , either . And there are millions of stars out there to explore . Billions . There 's no way we could check out all of them in the next thousand years . " She looked back down at Liam . " No , if I tell them there 's nothing here , they wo n't come back any time soon . " " So , will you ? " " I do n't know yet . I 'm thinking about it . " The entire tribe had been listening in . Most of them did n't know enough English to understand what we were talking about , but they knew something serious was going on . Normally by this time of evening people would be pairing off and heading into the woods , but nobody moved , not even the men who had been trying earlier to win Ilex 's attention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come with me . I want to show you something . " " Okay . " They stood and disappeared into the darkness , firelight illuminating Kylona 's bare backside and Ilex 's colorful pants and shirt . I did n't see either of them again that night . Their departure seemed to be the signal everyone else was waiting for ; within half an hour I was alone by the campfire . I finally retired to the lander , figuring somebody ought to stand watch over our transportation just in case Ilex was n't what she seemed to be , but nobody disturbed me . Nobody even came close to the lander . I know ; I was awake all night , looking out into the darkness in case Kylona decided to return . I did n't see much of them the next few days , either . I 'd catch a glimpse of them now and then , running through the forest or swimming in the surf or playing volleyball on the beach . Ilex was easy to spot ; she had shed her clothing that first night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head taller than the other women and white as a snowbank , she stood out like a polar bear in a coal mine . I could have joined them , I suppose , but I felt like a third leg . Unwanted , unneeded , awkward . I tried to tell myself that Kylona was just making sure Ilex really wanted to protect the planet , but it became harder and harder to remain convinced as the days went by . There was n't anything I could do about it , though , so I kept my distance and let them have their fun . They came to me once , to ask if I could teach Ilex how to fly . I 'd tried it a couple of times when I 'd first arrived , showing off for our new girlfriends , but it turned out to be more difficult than I 'd expected . I looked worse than a penguin on land , so I had n't done it much since , but apparently it had impressed Kylona more than I thought . " It 's highly overrated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to set your coupling constant to practically nothing in order to stay airborne , but then your arms do n't do you any good when you try to push against the air . " " So I 've noticed . " She bounced a couple times on her toes , then said " Cee cee two percent " on the way up and continued into the air , windmilling her arms for balance . It did n't do much good , because she had become less substantial than a retinal afterimage . " Try ten percent , " I told her . " And flap like hell . " I had to shout to make her hear me , since her eardrums were less efficient now , too . She continued upward , just barely in control . I thought , perhaps uncharitably , that a good stiff breeze could solve my problem for a while , but I knew that Kylona would n't see it the way I did . She 'd just make me chase Ilex down , and probably berate me for not warning her of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own-right on top of me . Kylona was laughing at her antics , and I was just beginning to grin , when she apparently got tired of playing the buffoon and returned her coupling constant to a hundred percent . Unfortunately I was standing right below her , with my own constant set to an energy-efficient seventy-five percent . I got a considerably more intimate view of her chest than I wanted , and when I pulled my head out of her rib cage and shoved her aside I saw that she had driven me waist-deep into the ground , too . Both she and Kylona were laughing like fools now . I probably should have laughed too , but If elt like the fool , so I just clawed myself up out of the ground and stalked off with as much dignity as I could muster . They did n't follow me , and I did n't see them again for days . Etinitu and Yavetra joined in the fun , so Tilbey and Liam suddenly had a lot of free time , too . We used the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went up to the Spook and did more maintenance there . The starship was cold and airless , but it had been home during the long flight out from Earth and it could be home again any time we chose to use it . By the time we finished tuning things up it was ready to fly all the way to the galactic core if we wanted to take it there . With Ilex 's permission Tilbey even loaded one of her spare mass-eliminators and clone tanks on board , then spent a few days in his lab figuring out how they worked and building another two sets so we would each have one . Liam had to think about it a while when we asked him whether he wanted his mounted in the ship or taken down to the planet . The new mass-eliminators were self-contained ; he no longer needed the Spook 's fusion plant for power . Ever since we 'd discovered that Islandia was inhabited , he had intended to stay behind when Tilbey and I moved on , but now he was n't so sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like keeping all our eggs in one basket . Let 's take mine down for now . We can always change our minds later . " I wondered how much later that would be . I actually felt a pang of regret when we left for the ground again . Considering how close Kylona and leg were when we 'd come up here , I did n't imag ine there was much left for me on Islandia by now anyway I was right , but not quite in the way I 'd expected . Dex and Kylona were both in space . They 'd called down Ilex 's lander on autopilot and ridden it back to her ship , where she was preparing a doctored report to send to Earth . It was a wonder of misdirection . She took hours of video of every planet but Islandia , covering them and all their moons in such nit-picking detail that there was no question whether she could have missed a planet in the habitable zone . She even fabricated a landing site on one of the ice moons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there before going on . I met her and Kylona when they landed . She parked her sleek ground-to-orbit craft next to our bulbous cargo carrier , and a few minutes later the two women came down the ramp like royalty . No backing down a ladder for them . It was mid-afternoon ; the sun was bright on their glowing skin , and a light breeze wafted their hair out behind them as they came to the foot of the ramp . They were giggling like teenagers , sharing some private joke . I forced a smile and said " Hello , " and I gave Kylona a kiss , but my heart was n't really in it . Especially when she made just a pretense of kissing back . I tried not to show my disappointment , but it must have been obvious . " Thanks for helping us keep UNASA in the dark , " I said to Ilex . I started to turn away , but she giggled and leaned forward to plant a big kiss square on my lips before I could react . It felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant turned up , so there was plenty of substance to it , but it was n't quite the same as with a real person . Something about it was familiar , though . Her lips were different , and she was taller-yet I knew that kiss . " Kylona ? " I asked , incredulous . Kylona , standing beside her , said , " Oooo , you win major boyfriend points for that ! " Ilex-at least her ghost body-said , " I told you he 'd know the difference . Yes , it 's me . We traded places . I wanted to find out what it was like to be a ghost . " " You . . I ... what ? " I spluttered before I found my voice . Then I said , " Trade back ! Right now ! " " But it 's fun ! You never told me how much fun it is . " When you become a ghost by falling into the machinery and electrocuting yourself , " fun " is n't the first word that comes to mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you 've gotten used to the condition ; it 's just something that happened to you , something you learned to live with . Kylona had chosen to do it , though , and she could go back any time she wanted to . Of course she would think it was fun . " I want to fly , " she said . " No you do n't . It's- " " Cee cee ten percent , " she said , and she became as insubstantial as smoke . Then she kicked off with her toes , flapped her arms , and rose up into the air " Come down ! " I shouted . " You do n't know how dangerous that is ! " " It 's not dangerous . Look ! " Her voice was thin and reedy now that her throat was no more solid than the rest of her . She flapped harder , rising up toward the tops of the trees . " Stop ! " I yelled . " The wind ! " But it was too late . The air was breezy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a steady wind was blowing inland from the ocean as the sun warmed the island . It caught her , whipped her right through the branches of a tree , then swirled her around and out of sight . I turned to Kylona 's body , which presumably housed Ilex 's mind at the moment . " You ! " I shouted . " She could blow halfway around the world before she figures out how to maneuver . " " Oh , relax , " she said . " She 's not in any danger . All she needs to do is raise the coupling constant again and she 'll fall right back to the ground . " " Breaking her neck in the process ! " Ilex laughed . " She could hit the surface from orbit and not do herself any damage , and you know it . " That was true enough , but it did n't make me any happier . " And what if she hits at fifty percent ? " I asked . I did n't wait for an answer , because we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . While Ilex stood there thinking about it , I said , " Command " to engage the autopilot 's control functions , then said , " coupling constant twenty percent , " and leaped into the air . I had to flap harder to stay aloft at twenty percent than she did at ten , but I had more interaction with matter so the wind picked me up even quicker than it did her . I swirled up over the treetops , spun around once in an eddy behind a tall snag , then bobbed along toward the mountaintop . I could see her ahead of me , a tiny white cloud struggling to grab hold of passing treetops . Then the wind lifted her higher , and she tried to swim back down . " Increase the coupling constant a little at a time ! " I yelled , but my voice did n't carry much better than hers did . I flapped harder , trying to catch up . I reached her just as she started to panic . I heard her scream , " Cee cee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I shouted , but it was too late . She did n't just drop ; she streaked toward the ground like a rock thrown hard . Even at that she would have been okay if she had n't reacted the way anyone would in a similar situation . I heard her yell , " Wait ! " and then " Cee cee ten percent again ! " She faded to nearly nothing just as she hit the ground . The forest floor swallowed her up without so much as a thud . " Command , coupling constant one hundred percent , " I said , and braced myself for the fall . I hit hard , jarring the simulated breath from my simulated lungs . I would have broken half a dozen simulated bones if my mass eliminator had n't been programmed to avoid that unpleasant degree of realism . As it was I lay there for a second to gather my strength-and my courage-before I said , " Command , coupling constant ten percent . " The world grew dimmer as my retinae grew dramatically less efficient at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . I did n't need to breathe , but I took a deep breath anyway . . . and plunged down into the ground . Swimming through rock is n't much different than swimming through water . You can feel it swish through your fingers , the various densities of stone and dirt and organic stuff interacting like the water at different depths in a pool , and when it gets in your ears and nose it 's distracting as hell . I burrowed down a few dozen feet and began to swim in circles , calling out " Kylona ! Kylona ! " as best I could with a mouthful of granite . I must have done that for half an hour without any luck . Of course by then I did n't know which way was up , so I would n't have been much help even if I had found her , but I did n't know what else to do . I was in full-blown panic and was n't thinking very clearly , so I just kept searching . I probably would have kept it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand of God yank me out of the ground , and a moment later I was staring at the inside of a magnetic confinement cage . " Got him , " said Liam . I was inside the landing craft . So were Liam , Tilbey , and Ilex 's body . " You found her ! " I said . " Thank God you 're safe ! " I struggled free of the confinement cage , ordered my coupling constant up to normal again , and put my arms around her " Do n't you ever scare me like that again ! " I said . She cleared her throat and said , " I 'm Ilex . " " Oh . " I backed away . Then I gave her a crusty look and said , " Do n't you ever scare me like that again either . " " Deal , " she said . " Provided you make the same promise . We thought we 'd lost you . " " I thought I 'd lost her . What happened ? " " She popped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree root and followed it up . But when you did n't come up after her , we started to worry , so Tilbey brought the lander over and turned on the juice . He had to rewire it for a directional pull , but that took him about three seconds . He 's good . " Tilbey shrugged . " It took five minutes , at least . " The odor of burned insulation told me it had n't been as simple as either of them made out . " Uh huh , " I said . I looked out the viewscreen . Kylona was outside with Etinitu and Yavetra , snuffling and wiping her eyes . " Jeez , she does n't know I 'm safe yet , " I said . " Excuse me , but I 've got a reckless idiot to console . " I went to push past Ilex , but she stopped me . " Hang on a sec . I want to talk to you . " She turned to Liam and Tilbey . " You guys go outside and tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They nodded and left through the airlock . " Make it fast , " I said . " What are you going to say to her ? " she asked me . " I 'm going to tell her what a damned fool she was , for one thing , " I told her . " And then I-I guess I 'm going to tell her goodbye . " " Why ? " I looked out the viewscreen as Liam and Tilbey approached the three women . I felt my heart nearly melt , but not quite . " I know where she 's been the last few nights , " I said . " And I know when I 'm outclassed . I ca n't compete with you . " She looked at me like I was some kind of bug . " I ca n't imagine what she sees in you , " she said , " but the reason she wanted to trade bodies with me was so she could learn how it felt for you . And so she could decide if it was worth it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who said anything about leaving ? " I asked . " Apparently you did . Kylona thinks you might , at least , and she does n't want to lose you when you go . " " Oh . " I looked outside again . Kylona was nowhere in sight . I was just about to make my excuses and go find her when she burst in through the airlock and launched herself at me . " Lover ! " she said . I could n't answer , my lips being somewhat occupied for a moment . She backed off just long enough to say " I 'm sorry , " then made sure I could n't answer again . " I 'm going with you , " she said a little bit later . " How do you know I 'm going anywhere ? " I asked her . " Because the trouble you 've been waiting for has come and gone , she said . " I know you well enough to know what you 'll want to do next . And I want to go with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " I told her . " I wo n't let you do that . " She shook her head . " No I would n't . Ilex says I can freeze my body and wake it up again good as new whenever I want to . " I looked over at Ilex , who had been watching us , a wry grin on her face . She nodded and said , " She 's right . The Spook does n't accelerate hard enough to damage a body if it 's frozen . Plus it wo n't use any air or food that way . " I had never even considered that possibility , but given Ilex 's ability to move her mind back and forth , I realized it could work . I turned back to Kylona . " Even so , do you really want to leave Islandia behind , probably forever ? " She shrugged . " I want to see what 's on the next island just as much as you do . If we come back later to tell tales , so much the better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . " Then she smiled wide . " Besides , I want to learn how to fly . Really fly . " " Well , I 'll be damned . " I glanced around at the inside of the landing craft . Hard metal and plastic everywhere . The Spook was more of the same . I had n't really been looking forward to another cou ple of years on board , especially with just Tilbey for company . Suddenly the trip did n't look so sterile and cold after all . At least not for me . " What about Tilbey ? " I asked . " Or more to the point , what about Etinitu ? " " She and Yavetra both want to go , too . " Yavetra ? But Liam does n't want to leave Islandia . " She grinned at me . " That 's what he thinks . If Yavetra goes , he 'll go . " Six people on the Spook ? It could get crowded . But it would be the right kind of crowd . Unless . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I know disaster when I see it . You guys will have enough trouble keeping from killing each other as it is , without adding a wildcard to the mix . Besides , I 've got my own ship . " Where will you take it when you decide to go ? " I asked . She gave a little shrug . " Who knows ? It 's a big galaxy . " That it was . I had no idea where we would go , either , but Kylona was right . The journey was what mattered . And who you journeyed with . ( EDITOR 'S NOTE : Earlier stories of the " Astral Astronauts " include " Kissing Cousins , " November 1998 and Why Did n't You Think of That Before We Left ?
