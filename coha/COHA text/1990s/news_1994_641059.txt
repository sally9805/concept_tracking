<p> AFTER a lifetime of practice , Rollie Bar <p> nard wears a mantle of western virtue like pure gold . <p> Recently retired as mayor of Greenwood Village , Barnard takes care of chores around his suburban ranch clad in plaid flannel shirt , jeans and boots . Content , he says , that he has been true to the western values instilled in him in childhood : family , honor , duty . <p> Add to that the miracle of networking , a combination of good connections , good breaks and good works to learn the formula that vaulted Barnard into Denver 's inner sanctums . <p> " Some people have only five friends , " Barnard said in astonishment . " They <p> only have five people they are close to . But that is where ( my wife ) Patty and I are different . " <p> The Barnards have gobs of friends , cultivated over years , starting as young marrieds , when he ushered at Red Rocks for the Denver Junior Chamber of Commerce , and culminating with Barnard 's seats on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive board of the Roundup Riders of the West . <p> Tomorrow , many of those same friends will be on hand when Barnard is honored as the Citizen of the West at a $ 150-a-plate dinner that kicks off the National Western Stock Show . <p> This greenest of laurels , bestowed by leaders of Colorado 's inner circle of business , social and civic leaders , goes to one of their own for a lifetime of work well done . <p> National Western chairman Nick Petry cites Barnard 's leadership of the Denver-area Boy Scouts Council , of one of the city 's oldest financial institutions , and his work as mayor of Greenwood Village as examples of the ideal in western citizenship . <p> The award arrives when Barnard , 71 , is ripe to share with a world gone cynical and selfish how he succeeded while pursuing old-fashioned values established during his Park Hill upbringing . <p> BARNARD 'S successes have spanned a career in the nation 's capital when , at 31 , he was appointed to a senior position in the Postal Service during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midland Savings and <p> Loan Association ; and as head of the U.S. Savings and Loan League . <p> He also proved his valor as an infantry officer in Gen. George Patton 's 3rd Army during World War II , landing in France on D-day plus one in a division soon to be shattered by enemy fire . According to his daughter , Barnard 's luck held out in the weeks that followed when his platoons were twice destroyed and Barnard was the sole survivor . <p> And , in what may be the most challenging and treacherous post of all , Barnard took over in 1989 as mayor of strife-torn Greenwood Village , a job previously held by the fiery Freda Poundstone . <p> Taking firm control of the city 's affairs in 1989 , Barnard managed to put a lid on the police scandals , political disputes and pink decor that colored the mayor 's office of his predecessor . Setting a new tone , Barnard ordered the frills removed , dyed the carpet maroon and introduced a bronze statue of a fierce grizzly bear . <p> ETCHED into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict discipline and western ideals of his father , real estate developer George Barnard . <p> " My dad taught me , as most dads did , that your handshake better be your bond . Because that is what makes people get along in business and friendships , and whatever , " Barnard said . <p> And , as a precursor to a lifetime of volunteerism for good causes , George Barnard told his son to take care of Denver . <p> " Dad always said , ' Hey , do n't take something that you are not going to give back . Your city gives you a lot . So you give back to the city , " ' Barnard said . <p> The philosophy has been key to joining the ranks of Denver 's movers and shakers , Barnard said . Starting in his early years in the quasi-military Highlander Boys , Barnard became a joiner , participating in scores of groups that have ranged from the high-minded to high jinks . <p> The upshot is that Barnard has sold more than his share of tickets to picnics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The point is , all of us asked for things to do so we could help organizations , " Barnard said . <p> IT was after Barnard returned from Washington in 1960 - where he had risen to the post of assistant postmaster general - that this networking acquired depth and maturity . <p> Barnard became president of Midland Federal Savings and Loan , the state 's oldest lending institution , on the recommendation of two of his father 's friends and the approval at a lunch by the bank 's board of directors . <p> Within three months , the new bank president received two visitors bearing top credentials among Denver 's financial and civic circles - the late John Evans and Aksel Nielsen . <p> These insiders announced to the 39-year-old Barnard that he had been singled out to head a campaign to raise $ 25 million for the University of Denver . <p> " I said , ' You got to be kidding , " ' Barnard recalls . <p> But Nielsen , a friend of Barnard 's father , convinced the young bank president that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Unable to resist the excitement of gaining cachet with a good-old-boy network of people " who had made it , " Barnard agreed . <p> " So here comes little old Rollie , and they say , ' Hey , here is a bright-eyed young guy . " ' Barnard said . <p> The 6-foot 4-inch Barnard chuckles at the allusion . <p> " You say , ' Sure , I would like to help you raise $ 25 million for DU and get Forward Metro Denver on its wheels . ' At the same time you are mixing with the established powers on 17th Street , they are looking at you as someone they can count on , and they learn that you work hard and are enthused by community . That 's how you get there , " Barnard said . <p> It is , as they say , a very exclusive club . <p> BARNARD finds the essence of insider experience distilled within his membership in the Roundup Riders of the Rockies , a group known for its annual , week-long trek over about 100 miles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horseback ride in the West . <p> It all happens during the third week of July each year , when 75 Roundup Riders , each with one invited guest , set out on horseback at dawn to cover about a 20- or 25-mile section of the trail . <p> At nightfall , the trail ends in a campground where any discomforts of the ride fade as the riders arrive at their own tent city . And crew and caterers provide meals laced with cholesterol and comfort as cozy as any at the Brown Palace Hotel . <p> " We really put up a whole city every day . We have a whole electrical system , providing lights throughout the camps and tents . We bring in a toilet truck and a shower truck with 18 stalls . There are lights and running water everywhere , " Barnard said . <p> Each morning , the riders arise at dawn to strike camp and mount for another day in Colorado 's outdoors . <p> While 10- to 12-hour rides can be marred by sore backsides and minor mishaps on the trail , invitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a week of male bonding with some of Colorado 's longtime business and political leaders . <p> Numbered among its ranks are the six men , including Barnard , who inaugurated the Citizen of the West award in 1978 . Denver Post columnist Red Fenwick was the first recipient . <p> The ride , aimed at preserving the heritage of the American cowboy , would not be the place for social or business opportunism , Barnard said . <p> " As a matter of fact , it is absolutely forbidden to try to develop business on the ride . Now , I am sure that ( Roundup Rider ) Charlie Gates , for example , has had some significant business relationships develop on the ride , " he said . " I got a great many riders as customers when I was at Midland ( Savings And Loan ) . " <p> The group , founded in 1948 by Denver socialite Frank Ricketson , emphasizes the qualities attributed to an idealized version of the American cowboy - horsemanship , independence and simplicity . <p> Barnard recounts solemn discussions with newcomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a man and his horse . At other times , the group participates in the athletic horsemanship of a gymkhana and jokes around the fireside . <p> Barnard said each newcomer , called a colt , is carefully scrutinized for his horsemanship and ability to bring special human qualities that qualify him as a " hale fellow , well met . " <p> Acceptance as an insider takes 10 years and 10 rides , after which the candidate is eligible for full membership into the group 's very exclusive brotherhood - one so close it defies description , Barnard said . <p> With 75 men ? " Yeah , and the fun of it is , in all the years I have been on the ride , I have never heard an angry word said . There has never been anything out of sorts because we admire each other immensely . And they are very affectionate - in the proper terms for men being affectionate , " Barnard said . <p> As part of that bond , Barnard has told his children that the tally book listing the group members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety , Barnard said . <p> " If you need anything , just pick a name and call . And they will drop whatever they are doing and they will be there to help you . That is exactly how we feel about each other , " Barnard said . <p> Barnard has no apologies that the group - all white , male and horsemen - includes no minorities . <p> " It 's not an issue . This is a private club . Members are allowed to invite one guest . That is usually someone very close to them . There is nothing to keep anyone from inviting a close friend of any description . But the history of the thing is that people invited have been all white . " <p> Carol Johnson , a member of the Greenwood Village council who has enjoyed blasting Barnard as an " elitist , " said she <p> once provoked Barnard by suggesting that women should <p> be invited on the ride . <p> " He recoiled like he came round a curve and saw a rattlesnake on the road , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values is nowhere more evident than in his home . <p> This year , surrounded by adoring children , Barnard and his wife , Patty Bierkamp Barnard , celebrated the 50th anniversary of their war-time marriage in 1943 . <p> " My parents are amazing , they have never given up hope on any of their kids . They always supported us , even though sometimes they told us of their disappointment and dissatisfaction , " said Laurie Kostelecky , youngest of the Barnards ' children . <p> Barnard said he and Patty have walked lockstep together over the years to impart a commitment to family unity with their children : Michael D. Barnard , 47 , an orthopedic surgeon in Shelton , Wash. ; daughter Becky S. Wulfestieg , 45 , Tacoma , Wash. ; and Laurie Beth Kostelecky , 41 , a resident of Ken Caryl in Jefferson County . <p> " Family unity is not just something that happens , " Barnard said . " There are rules of the house and expectations of how you will be reflective of your family . How you will join in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family is that everybody is to be a full-paid member . Everyone does their jobs . As elder statesman , I expect youngsters to adhere to what I expect in the way of lifestyle . Lifestyle is the way a family lives its life . If we are going camping , the whole family goes camping . " <p> The commitment also applied to Dad . <p> When accepting his postal service appointment , Barnard laid his job on the line to make room for quality time with his young family . <p> " I ( said ) I hoped I had n't blown myself out of the chair , but I would not work weekends on government business unless it was an emergency . Because I am here with a very young family and I want to spend my time with them , " Barnard said . <p> OUTDOORSMAN , horse breeder , dog lover , Barnard lives at a five-acre ranch deep in the exclusive mink and manure compound found in the mile-square area known as rural Greenwood Village . <p> The drive along Long Road to the ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the High Line Canal , an occasional pumpkin patch , farmhouses with barns and corrals and geese floating serenely in a pasture pond . <p> About 3 miles to the east , the high-rise commercial buildings of the Denver Technological Center cast profiles on the skyline . The commercial section of the city keeps a respectable distance from the scene of wealth and gentility . <p> At his front doorstep and bigger than life , a bear dressed as Santa Claus , which once graced the roof of Denver 's Botanic Gardens , waves across the fields to neighbors . <p> Barnard and Patty indulge their deep love of animals at their home , tending four appaloosa horses and two rare appaloosa mules , three Australian shepherd dogs and at least two cats . <p> Mementos of travel crowd the walls and furniture inside the Barnard home . Interspersed in a mix of antique and Early American furniture are collections the couple has acquired . There is a display of dozens of Beatrix Potter porcelain rabbits , a daunting array of demitasse cups , pewter miniatures depicting western and Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alaska . And one wall is covered entirely by snapshots of the family and their pets . <p> But Barnard 's life has been far from provincial . <p> During his appointment in the nation 's capital , Barnard and his family immersed themselves in its complex political and social lifestyle , hosting their share of fashionable parties . <p> The Barnards deny that they are " party animals , " however , preferring gatherings for good causes and good times rather than for social climbing . <p> Barnard worked as treasurer of the Morris Animal Foundation for many years to create the solid financial base that has made the animal organization the world 's largest nongovernment foundation devoted to companion animals and wildlife . <p> Barnard also treasures his membership in the Tower Club , a small and virtually anonymous group of business and civic leaders that has met since 1911 to consider ways to help the Denver community with problems such as the emergence of gangs . <p> " The people who get together to talk about the well-being of their community are sort of a different breed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country club for a drink and to socialize . These people are dead serious in trying to fathom what needs to be done in the community , " Barnard said . <p> BARNARD sometimes acknowledges that his philosophy of life has been disappearing over the horizon . <p> " Hey , it is a whole new world . I have never had an employment contract in my life . I did n't need the protection . Today everyone needs tenure or longevity to protect you from being fired for not doing your job right . Or to protect the company from your leaving them high and dry . " <p> The attitudes stem partly because local businesses , like his own Midland , merged into national companies . Such removed ownership has led to a loss of personal contacts that once gave trust to business relations , Barnard said . <p> " There are far too many personal entrepreneurs for their own benefit who set the pace for different businesses around the country . People drive very hard for personal gratification , and I think that we have virtually lost any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " The idea of sticking with something and making it work is losing ground , and that is disappointing and discouraging . I have enjoyed my life to the fullest without the slightest concern of ever letting anybody down or anybody letting me down .
