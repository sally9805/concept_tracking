The Clinton camp 's public response to Paula Jones ' sexual-harassment suit has been what could be called the " big-hair defense "  --  jokes about her working-class origins and bravado that this evangelist 's daughter from Lonoke , Arkansas , could not possibly win a " he said , she said " dispute with the President of the United States . Former Clinton adviser James Carville wisecracked that if you " drag $100 bills through trailer parks , there 's no telling what you 'll find . " Clinton lawyer Bob Bennett has dismissed the suit as " tabloid trash with a legal caption on it " and once boasted that in a trial he could win the case in 20 minutes . <P> But quietly , in the legal arena , Clinton has pinned his hopes on a more cautious strategy : asserting that the Constitution protects sitting Presidents from having to answer civil lawsuits . Clinton v. Jones , which is being argued in the Supreme Court this week , promises to be the most important " presidential privilege " case since the court ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims of confidentiality , because they were needed for a criminal prosecution . And it is shaping up to be a virtual must-win legal battle for Clinton , who is asking the Supreme Court to move beyond existing precedents  --  the court has as yet never decided whether a President can be sued for actions taken before he took office  --  to protect him from what could be the most embarrassing controversy of his presidency . <P> Jones ' road to the Supreme Court has been a rocky one . Her well-known claim is that Clinton saw her working at a Governor 's Quality Management Conference in Little Rock five years ago , sent a state trooper to bring her to his hotel room and ended up pulling down his pants and asking her to " kiss it . " From the day she went public with her allegations , Jones has been dogged by trouble , from a brother-in-law who went on television to doubt her ( he now says he believes her ) to old photos of her that were published in Penthouse . And by making an appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another with the Conservative Political Action Conference , Jones fueled suspicions that her suit was politically motivated . <P> But recently Jones ' claims have been receiving a more respectful hearing . Stuart Taylor , a former New York Times reporter who now works for the American Lawyer , has become Jones ' most prominent champion , arguing that hers is a strong case of sexual harassment . Taylor notes , for example , that there is solid corroborating evidence : that within a day of the alleged encounter , Jones told two friends and two sisters what happened and that her story has remained consistent . And after some investigation , Taylor found that she was fundamentally apolitical and did n't consort with Clinton enemies until after she failed to be taken seriously . <P> The issue before the Supreme Court this week , however , is not the substance of Jones ' suit but whether it should go forward now . The court has previously recognized the principle of immunity for official presidential acts , but it has never extended the doctrine to acts that occurred before a President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegations and said he has no recollection of ever meeting her , is asking the court to hold that presidential immunity requires that Jones ' lawsuit wait until he leaves office .
