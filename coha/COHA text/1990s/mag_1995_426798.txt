The rewards of making your own cider <p> Upstairs in the cider mill 50 bushels of apples surround the grinder box . Above the box hangs a sweet haze , like mist over a waterfall , as the grinder 's rows of steel teeth , blurred by speed , chew the stream of tumbling fruit , spitting it out to the floor below . It 's dangerous and exhilarating , standing here at the edge of the two-foot-square hole in the wooden floor , emptying basket after basket into the shallow-sided hopper , trying to keep the flow even and marveling at the speed with which the apples disappear : a bushel of ' Ben Davis ' , another of ' Stayman Winesap ' , some ' Golden Delicious ' , some unnamed wild apples , until the doorbell on the wall rings twice , signaling us to stop . <p> Downstairs , the mill 's owner , Bob Belanger , and our son Ben finish spreading the pulped apples , which have already begun to turn brown from exposure to the air . With long-handled hoes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corners of the shallow wooden frame that shapes a heavy canvas press cloth into a neat , four-foot square . Then they fold the four corners of the cloth to the center to make a neatly packaged " cheese ' , and lift off the frame , replacing it with a slatted press board . Atop this they replace the frame , line it with another press cloth , and ring for more apples . <p> Only when there are four cheeses stacked between five press boards are we ready for pressing . Then the whole stack , including the watertight table on which it rests , turns like a train car in a roundhouse , riding on a metal rail around the press 's octagonal base . When the stack is positioned beneath the press itself , Bob reaches up and throws a red-handled lever to engage the black iron gears . Thick with grease , they begin to turn , and with each clanking revolution , the great I-beams of the ancient press slowly descend . <p> A crowd has gathered to watch . As the press reaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stack begins to flatten . Almost at once the cider starts flowing from the sides , coalescing into rivulets and thence into a thick stream that pours through a hole in one corner of the tray , splashing into a tank below . A paper cup dipped into the stream overflows at once , yielding the first taste , and already there is plenty to pass around . <p> Cider making is an autumn tradition as old as the culture of apples . The Latin word sicera , from which our word cider comes , was used to describe apple juice as early as the fourth century , but its root comes from the ancient Hebrew word schechar , meaning " strong drink . " The Fertile Crescent of Asia Minor was the birthplace of pomology , and the scribes of Ramses II in 1300 B.C. described extensive apple orchards planted along the Nile River delta . Cider would have accompanied their culture as surely as it does now , for cider has always flowed from apple trees . Even the invention of synthetic pesticides , home canning , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Amateur or professional , anyone who sets out to raise even a few apple trees will soon be making cider . It 's a matter of simple arithmetic . <p> A single bushel of apples contains roughly 125 medium-size fruits . At an apple a day , that 's enough for four months , or to make 15 nine-inch pies , or 36 pint jars of applesauce . A single standard-size apple tree , however , will often produce ten or more such bushels . Furthermore , despite the grower 's best efforts at thinning , spraying , and picking , there will always be apples that are too small , marred by insects and disease , or bruised from dropping to the ground . This is why there will always be cider . Cider making transforms fruit that would otherwise be wasted into something easily preserved and just as easily consumed . <p> As a rule of thumb , a bushel of apples will yield about three gallons of cider , depending on the juiciness of the apples and the fineness of the grinding . And while few families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the same fruit reduced to a few gallon jugs of juice has a way of disappearing without comment . <p> My own family began making cider almost as soon as I discovered that two sprays of the pesticide Imidan ( phosmet ) applied right after bloom reliably hung a crop of fruit on our six standard-size apple trees . From no apples at all , we suddenly went to more fruit than we could possibly eat , and since we were n't going to let this windfall rot , we turned to cider making . For 75 cents a gallon of finished juice , Bob Belanger does custom pressing on weekends . And if a customer does n't have the 10 to 15 bushels necessary for a pressing , he will trade them for cider already made . It 's a lot more interesting , however , to stick around and help press one 's own . <p> While any apple can be used to make cider , not all apples make good cider . Bad apples , in fact , make bad cider . In particular , an apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it has to be perfect , unbruised , or free of insects . But a half-decayed apple lying in the mud will make a cider that is not only unpleasant to drink , but possibly dangerous . Last year a batch of commercial cider here in New England was found to be contaminated with bacteria from deer droppings . This was the result of pressing unwashed drops  --  apples picked up off the orchard floor . Such possibilities are one more reason to appreciate cider that is homegrown , homepicked , and if not homemade , at least made under the gardener 's close supervision . <p> We supervise our cider very closely . We spend the summer watching the developing apples and issuing invitations to friends to help us pick . I also keep a sharp eye on various wild apples growing out of hedgerows and along old stone walls . These yield fruit that is completely unprepossessing : often runty , hard , and bitter-skinned . But when blended with sweeter apples , the tannins from these astringent varieties create the finest-tasting cider . Crab apples in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthwhile to add even a peck or two to the mix . <p> Since our selection of apples for cider each year depends in part on the vagaries of nature , no two years are the same . What does stay the same , though , are the comments of those who taste the result . Invariably , our cider is judged far superior to any of the so-called tame ciders . <p> The apples that make the best blend are late ones  --  those gathered around the time of the first frost . Most years we wait until late October , stockpiling bushels of them in the cool shed and barn , culling and washing them on the last day for one big pressing . But some of the apples we grow are early ones , and last year as an experiment we acquired a small cider press and grinder of our own . Summer apples do n't keep the way winter ones do , and making a few bushels ' worth of cider seemed a good alternative to dumping these apples uneaten on the compost heap . So we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press we bought is the Homesteader model made by Happy Valley Ranch in Paola , Kansas . It is a 160-pound screw-press with a 1 1/2-inch diameter screw and cast-iron cross arms mounted on a hardwood frame . The grinder is a 5 1/2-inch laminated wood cylinder with eight rows of serrated stainless-steel knives inside a cast-iron box . A handle attached to an 18-pound cast-iron flywheel does the turning . Apples dropped into this grinder emerge as a pulp , which falls into the mesh press bag lining the press tub . The tub itself is a cylinder of evenly spaced , beveled maple staves held together by two steel bands . <p> The capacity of the tub is roughly a bushel of apples pulped , but we have found it easier to grind and press a half tub at a time , which takes us roughly five minutes a cycle once we get going . Once a tub has been filled , it can be slid under the screw , the press bag folded over the pomace , a circular wooden block added to spread out the pressure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of two-by-two between the iron lugs atop the screw , our youngest son , Asa , can walk around and around the press , screwing it down almost effortlessly . Just as with the larger presses , cider begins to flow at once , and tapers off as the person turning the screw begins to turn the heavy press itself . We stop at that point , hesitant to wring out the last few drops lest something crack . <p> With our summer apples we have found that the yield is only about a gallon and a half per bushel , as opposed to the company 's advertised yield of two to three . The lower yield is probably due in part to using early apples , but we think part of the fault lies with the grinder . The grinder at the cider mill has teeth that can be adjusted to cut the apples to " the thickness of a dime . " The Happy Valley Ranch grinder can not be adjusted , and we found that its teeth spit out pieces , often with a large piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch thick . Reportedly , attaching an electric motor to the grinder so that it spins faster yields a finer mash ; so would using one of the antique hand grinders sitting around unused in many barns and sheds . <p> Until we improve our grinder 's efficiency , however , we will content ourselves with using the cider mill for most of our cider making and our Happy Valley Ranch press for a preseason taste of fresh-pressed juice . If we did n't have the larger press close by , we would be content producing ten or so gallons an hour . It 's just that the larger one can grind and press 200 gallons an hour . <p> We aim to make about half that much cider in a given year . Some we give away , but most of it we bottle in one-gallon plastic water jugs . In the refrigerator , sweet cider will keep several weeks before it ferments , but for long-term storage it must be frozen . Taking a cup of cider out of each gallon allows sufficient room for expansion . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holds more than 50 gallons . Even with New Hampshire 's high electric rates , it costs only about $5 a month to operate , scarcely doubling the cost of the cider 's pressing . There is an even more efficient form of long-term storage , however , that requires no electricity at all . <p> In every other country but our own , the word cider means an alcoholic beverage . When yeasts are allowed to consume the sugar , the resulting alcohol is sufficient to prevent the cider from spoiling even at room temperature . With wine grapes , alcohol concentrations as high as 12 percent are possible . Apples are much less sweet , and so unless you add extra sugar you end up with a much more modest , less intoxicating , level of 3 or 4 percent alcohol . <p> By the early 18th century , hard cider was the customary drink in North America . Typically breakfast would be washed down with a quart of it . Colonel John Bellows , a fellow New Hampshire apple grower with a 30-acre orchard , is reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of which were said to have been drunk in the neighboring town before the next harvest . This was not to last . Having first targeted brandy , whiskey , and rum , the temperance movement eventually went after even hard cider . By the time Prohibition was repealed , the nation had lost its taste for the beverage , and turned to beer instead . <p> The making of hard cider , however , is enjoying something of a renaissance . The most comprehensive account of the process is in Sweet and Hard Cider , by E. Annie Proulx and Lew Nichols ( Garden Way Publishing , 1980 ) , which not only chronicles cider 's illustrious past , but details precisely which apples , equipment , and recipes one needs to make one 's own . ( Proulx , best known for her 1994 Pulitzer Prize-winning book The Shipping News , is remembered around the offices of Horticulture for having contributed many fine articles over the years . ) <p> With the encouragement of two of our friends , Dan and Ouida , who have made their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally taken the plunge . The first steps were easy enough . Instead of bottling all our fresh cider in gallon jugs , we poured 25 gallons of it into five-gallon glass carboys once used for bottled spring water . Carboys in a variety of sizes can be purchased at stores selling wine-and beer-making supplies . To the fresh cider we . immediately added one Campden tablet per gallon . This is sodium metabisulfite , which releases sulfur dioxide , thus killing off undesirable bacteria and yeasts . <p> Two weeks later , we carried the car-boys from our cool garage to Dan and Ouida 's basement . Dan measured both the acidity and sugar content of the cider , judged it to need no amending , and added a packet of champagne yeast to each container ( also available from homebrewing stores ) . We then plugged each neck with an air lock  --  a cork pierced by a section of plastic tubing . The other end we submerged in a tin can filled with water . This allowed the carbon dioxide , which almost immediately began to bubble into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A week later , when the initial violent fermentation had slowed , Dan exchanged these tubes and cans for more traditional brewers ' air locks . After six weeks the cider had almost stopped bubbling , signaling that the yeast had consumed all the available sugar and stopped multiplying . Primary fermentation was done , and in theory we now had " still cider . " The yeast , which had initially turned the cider a murky yellowish brown , had settled , and the carboys were now a transparent gold . <p> I , meanwhile , had been collecting glass . Empty champagne bottles may be easy to find after New Year 's , but not in November in this economy . By spending Sunday evenings going through the glass dumpster at a nearby hotel that offers a champagne brunch , I managed to find what we needed . In an orgy of washing , scraping , and sterilizing with bleach , we got the labels off and all the bottles clean by the time the cider stopped bubbling . <p> On a rainy Sunday afternoon in early December @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My wife , Elisabeth , spooned two teaspoons of sugar into each bottle , Dan siphoned off the cider from the carboys , I banged in plastic champagne corks with a wooden mallet , and Ouida twisted on the wire cages that provide security against the corks ' escaping . ( Corks and cages cost us a dime apiece . ) Finally we hauled the corked bottles back to our cellar to sit for three months . The yeast , reinvigorated by the small amount of additional sugar , began to grow again , but in the confines of a sealed bottle it had nowhere to go and so produced a sparkling , or champagne , cider . <p> Maybe it was beginner 's luck . We made 125 bottles . From the kitchen steps the loosened corks shoot all the way to the perennial bed  --  an activity that , like fireworks , is too much fun not to indulge in . Poured into a glass , the cider foams handsomely . The color is wonderful  --  the lightest clear amber  --  with streams of tiny bubbles rising to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alcoholic . The fragrance is what I think winemakers would describe as a " big nose . " It is an unalloyed delight . Even Elisabeth , who partway through our epic of bottle washing was looking askance at the whole project , has been completely won over . " Why drink anything else ? " she says , popping open another bottle . Why indeed . <p> For the address of Happy Valley Ranch , turn to page 82 . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : This photograph , circa 1916 , shows a double basket press , which permitted simultaneous grinding and pressing of the apples . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : While the author 's modern handpress ( previous page ) has only a single basket , it still allows for " simultaneous tasting .
