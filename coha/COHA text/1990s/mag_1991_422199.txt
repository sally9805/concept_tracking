Section : Articles Boris Yeltsin was a Comunist , became a democrat , is a hero . Will he be a statesman ? <p> BORIS YELTSIN 'S entire life prepared him to climb onto that Red Army tank in front of the Russian Federation headquarters . He was a born rebel , and a born leader  --  a little bit of a hooligan , ' he recalled in his 1990 autobiography , Against the Grain . From first grade on he was elected class leader  --  and prankster . Once when the teacher was out , he persuaded the entire class to jump out the first-floor window . At his primary-school graduation , about age 12 , he stood before six hundred parents , teachers , and pupils , asked permission to speak , praised some teachers , then denounced one as unfit to teach because she mocked and abused pupils and even made them clean her house and feed her pig . He was expelled , but defiantly appealed  --  and got the teacher fired . <p> Such rebellion marked his entire career . As Party boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apartment house where Brezhnev had once lived into a museum . ( He lost that one . ) In 1987 , by now Moscow Party boss and Politburo member , he did to Gorbachev exactly what he had done to his grammar-school teacher . At a Central Committee meeting he rose , demanded to speak , and tore into Gorbachev for attempting to reform by half-measures and for tolerating a growing cult of personality '  --  an explosive evocation of Stalinism . <p> Yeltsin 's great advantage over Gorbachev is that he has shown a large capacity to learn from the dynamic experience of freedom in the 1985 - 91 glasnost era , while Gorbachev , having initiated the reforms , clung to old doctrine . Situationally Yeltsin 's career has parallels with Washington 's and with Lincoln 's . Like Washington , he has the opportunity to become a monarch or to refuse . Like Lincoln , amid domestic turmoil he may be obliged to become a temporary dictator , closing newspapers and jailing opponents , in order to preserve constitutionalism . These 1862 words of Lincoln 's summarize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the quiet past are inadequate to the stormy present . As our case is now so must we think anew and act anew . We must disenthrall ourselves and save our country . ' <p> Last February , former political prisoner Sergei Kovalev , now chairman of the Russian Parliament 's human- rights committee , told Washington Post correspondent David Remnick : We were all very hesitant about Yeltsin at first , but he has proved capable of change and understanding . Yeltsin and his popular support are going to be vital to any battle for human rights and reform . ' A Different Person <p> YELTSIN 'S ability to learn made him a magnet for all the reformers who grew disgusted with Gorbachev 's ideological stagnation ; Shevardnadze , Yakovlev , Tatyana Zaslavskaya , Stanislav Shatalin , all once close Gorbachev advisors . Yeltsin was the first politician in the history of the USSR to voluntarily quit the high schedule of Party appointments , ' noted Sergey Kredov in Rabochaya Tribuna . He did so because he recognized that his positive program of that time had run out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the honest Yeltsin opted for Golgotha . To my way of thinking , ' said Kredov , Yeltsin 1987 and Yeltsin 1990 are different people in terms of their political views . Thank heavens . . . . Thus far the growth of society 's self-awareness had been identical to the growth of Yeltsin himself . With him came deliverance from illusions . ' <p> Yeltsin told New York Timesman Bill Keller in August 1990 , I was a product of the time . I absorbed a lot from the system that is now so sick . I 'm in the process of a self-revision , though I am a bit old for it . ' <p> He moved light years on economics . His first visit to the United States , in September 1989 , was the catalyst . He spoke then of privatizing ' only 10 to 15 per cent of the economy . But he left a convert to free enterprise : We must incorporate the experience of the United States . The U.S. knows how to run things , how to live well . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union has lost sight of reality and there 's too much theory . ' <p> In his autobiography , published in March 1990 , Yeltsin still expressed misgivings about private property . But in a formal speech on his second U.S. visit this June , he declared : We are firmly committed to the principle of free enterprise as the basis of economic reform in Russia . ' He spent a day visiting a Manhattan garment manufacturer , questioning workers , including some Soviet emigres , about wages and working conditions . And on ABC 's Nightline , he said : Highly qualified workers we do have , perhaps no less qualified than American workers . But he gets one-tenth of what the American worker gets . . . . He does n't have his own property . He does n't own land . He does n't own the factory , the enterprise , the shop , or anything . Now he 's going to have the option to be owner . . . and there 'll be a real interest in good work being done at these enterprises and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' <p> In July 1990 , Yeltsin adopted the radical Five Hundred Day Plan ' for marketization worked out by Grigory Yavlinsky , 38 , a Young Turk who broke with his mentor , Gorbachev 's Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov , over preserving central planning . Yavlinsky 's six-hundred-page document was literally a program for dismantling Communism . It will represent the storming of the Winter Palance in reverse , ' said Izvestia commentator Mikhail Berger . The idea of selling inefficient state-run factories and collective farms to the public excited Yeltsin . By now president of Russia 's parliament , he made Yavlinsky Russia 's deputy prime minister for economic reform . <p> Yeltsin won Gorbachev 's agreement to launch the Five Hundred Day Plan on October 1 , 1990 . But then Gorbachev reversed himself . For his own reasons , he decided on a radical swing to the right , joining the Party old guard , KGB , army , and military - industrial complex . Gorby 's right turn led to Foreign Minister Shevardnadze 's resignation and was followed by the KGB murder of 15 Lithuanians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a Budapest-like countercoup . But world reaction to photos of a Soviet tank crushing a Lithuanian stopped Gorby with half-measures once again . Yeltsin flew to Estonia to show his support for the Baltic independence movement , and publicly demanded Gorbachev 's resignation in a nationwide TV interview . By spring , Gorbachev had reversed himself again , embraced Yeltsin and Russian autonomy from the center , ' which would let Yeltsin carry out the Five Hundred Day Plan independently . That in turn brought on the Sixty Hour Coup . The Five Hundred Day Plan may finally begin on October 1 , 1991 , exactly one year late . <p> Radio Liberty journalist Alexander Rahr points to another respect in which Yeltsin has grown : his regard for religion and Russian culture . In this he seeks to bridge the chasm dividing Russians since Peter the Great , Westernizers ' versus Russifiers , ' personified most recently by Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn . <p> Indeed , in his autobiography Yeltsin welcomes the regeneration of the church in the USSR : I am convinced that the moment is coming when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come to the aid of our society . For in these words : Thou shalt not kill ; Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , lie those very moral principles that will enable us to survive even the most critical situations . ' Yeltsin started attending Russian Orthodox Church services , bringing TV cameramen along . In June he told the National Press Club in Washington : I do not have a real faith in God . That 's the way I was brought up . But I hope this is in part made up for by my two little granddaughters and my grandson , who instead of going to the Young Pioneers , went to church to be baptized , and who wear little crosses . ' On the weekend following the coup , he was in church again . Sign of the Cross <p> YELTSIN won more than 57 per cent of about eighty million votes in the June election . At his inauguration in the Kremlin he stood alone and recited the oath of office , swearing to adhere to the constitution and laws of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its freedom and rights . ' Patriarch Aleksei II of the Russian Orthodox Church blessed Yeltsin with the sign of the cross : By the will of God and the choice of the people , you are bestowed with the highest office in Russia . . . . We will pray for you . ' A full choir performed the triumphant Glory ' chorus from Glinka 's A Life for the Czar . A red-white-and-blue Russian flag covered the huge hall 's massive picture of Lenin . <p> In view of his present power , Yeltsin 's inaugural address bears new scrutiny . He proclaimed : Great Russia is rising from its knees . We shall surely transform it into a prosperous , law-based , democratic , peaceful , and sovereign state . The president is not a god , not a monarch , not a miracle worker . He is a citizen . . . . And in Russia the individual will become the measure of all things . ' <p> Yeltsin is now carrying out the de- Leninization and de-Communization of Russia . Last year , he threw Lenin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nail in the wall . Feliks Dzerzhinsky 's statue in front of KGB headquarters is gone , and soon Lenin 's effigy will be removed from the Red Square mausoleum . <p> In the aftermath of the coup , Yeltsin padlocked the Party Central Committee headquarters , sealed its files for investigators , and persuaded Gorbachev to appoint Yeltsin 's own men to head the KGB and the Interior and Defense Ministries . It was a second coup , ' declared CBS correspondent Tom Fenton . And it was clearly Yeltsin 's coup . <p> Now that his position and power are pre-eminent , Yeltsin will inevitably have to mute the trumpets of independence a bit . Russia itself has 31 autonomous ethnic regions and more than one hundred ethnic groups . If Wilsonian self-determination of nations ' were the rule , that would create a map resembling Swiss cheese , ' notes the Washington Post 's David Remnick . Last September Yeltsin told nationalists in Kazan , in the Tatar Autonomous Republic , Take as much independence as you can handle , ' assuring them , Your decision will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accompanied him on his tour of the hinterlands , that he hopes to negotiate treaties with these little enclaves for limited autonomy . <p> To his Tatar audience he suggested : I do n't know , perhaps you will decide to delegate your foreign relations to Russia . Why should you keep 170 embassies in 170 countries ? ' But a banner greeting him proclaimed : Yeltsin is a good man . Freedom is better . ' <p> Still , if Yeltsin achieves his vision for a Russian commonwealth , boundaries will not matter much and Russian citizenship may be as proud a boast as Roman citizenship was in the Augustan age . Tadzhiks and Kirgizians alike would covet it . <p> In Washington Yeltsin was asked to predict what the Soviet Union will be like in the year 2000 : Our people have never yet had the chance to feel free , and that is the most important thing : that they have liberty . That is what the rule of law is all about . . . . The primary goal for us should be to build a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its citizens on a par with international standards so that we could join the international agreements and covenants on human rights that already exist . We want to achieve for all our citizens access to all the benefits of society and the courts , equal justice under law . ' A fitting pronouncement from Russia 's first citizen . <p> By EUGENE METHVIN <p> <p> Mr. Methvin is a senior editor at Reader 's Digest . <p>
