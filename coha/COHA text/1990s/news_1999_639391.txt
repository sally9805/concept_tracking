<p> LEADVILLE - The mayor here is pulling up stakes and leaving town , following on the heels of the director of the chamber of commerce , the dean of the college , the founder of a newspaper and the operators of the movie theater and a prominent restaurant . <p> ' We 've lost a number of people all of a sudden , and it represents a major loss , ' consultant Mary Ellen Thoren said . ' These are our friends and important parts of the community . ' <p> And while the exodus represents a significant portion of the historic town 's civic leaders , locals are n't yet saying : ' Will the last one out of Leadville please turn out the lights ? ' <p> ' They will be missed , but Leadville will survive without them , ' merchant Dwayne Robinson said . <p> Still , the flight of movers and shakers from Leadville over the past couple of months has been somewhat staggering , although their reasons have varied as much as their destinations . <p> Mayor Pete Moore and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community involvement . Restaurateur Bob Alex and movie-theater operator Ed Wisbrun fled to the sunny beaches of Florida to open a hotdog stand this summer . Peter Starkel , a consultant instrumental in developing the Leadville Chronicle , headed to Michigan . <p> But perhaps none has had a greater impact than the husband-wife team of chamber director Gloria Cheshier and Joe Forrester , the dean of the Colorado Mountain College campus , who are putting Leadville in their rear-view mirror so that he may take a college presidency in Pennsylvania . <p> ' I think when Joe and Gloria leave , there 's going to be a huge void , ' said Chet Gaede , a member of the Leadville City Council . ' They 're both very dynamic people and I think everyone in town recognizes they 've done incredible amounts of stuff . ' <p> Professionally , they represent the lifeblood of Leadville in their jobs , tirelessly selling outsiders on the town and improving their lives once they get there . And personally , they have embraced both the old and the new in their passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in shaping the town 's civic projects and pushing for telecommunications improvements . <p> ' It 's hard to draw the line between where the job starts and where the community starts , ' Forrester said . ' One of the greatest compliments I 've received is that I 've had the college involved in every significant activity in Lake County . ' <p> But like the aspen leaves turning gold , many see the changes as a healthy natural progression rather than a devastating loss . <p> ' It 's a kind of changing of the guard , if you will , ' said Robinson , who was appointed president of the chamber of commerce . ' It 's sad that they 're leaving , but it 's a good opportunity for other leaders to step up and make a difference . ' <p> When Joe Forrester and Gloria Cheshier arrived in Leadville from El Paso , Texas , in late 1989 , unemployment lingered at 17 percent , half the buildings on the town 's main street were boarded up and winter was setting in . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community college with an uncertain future , and she moved without even having seen the fading mining town 10,152 feet above sea level . <p> ' I did n't own a pair of shoes with toes in them , ' Cheshier said . ' I bought four coats in one day . ' <p> Soon , however , they were enmeshed in the fabric of the small town . <p> ' The community clearly indicated a sense , when I was hired , that the college was not as much of a player in the community that the community wanted it to be , ' Forrester said . <p> While Forrester dug in at the CMC campus - which handles 3,200 students , including those at satellite facilities in Salida , Buena Vista and the Arkansas Valley 's state prison - Cheshier volunteered at town events , eventually landing the job as chamber director . <p> ' They decided the best way to get rid of me was to hire me , ' she joked . <p> Two months after they arrived , Leadville 's taxing entities - including CMC - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the first meeting , Forrester went to the bathroom and , unable to defend himself , was named its president , a title he still holds . <p> He targeted the town 's lack of focus as it transformed from mining to tourism . <p> ' When I moved around the community and asked the questions about the direction we should be taking , I never got a positive answer . People said , ' We do n't want to be Breckenridge . We do n't want to be Vail . " Pushing for an active approach rather than a series of defensive parries , he established a ' community visioning process ' called Silver 2000 , encouraging residents to find their own pet projects . The designation of U.S. 24 as a scenic byway and the creation of the Metal Belt bicycle trail are among the drive 's most prominent successes . <p> ' The key piece was for people within the community to find people with common interests . They began to step forward . It was n't Joe Forrester or the coalition . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noting that the town has a Silver 2005 plan , and he will recommend another for 2010 . ' The process is continuing . ' <p> Meanwhile , the school has evolved into a major player in town , a vast change from those early days when it was considered a throw-away campus and Leadville residents complained that CMC administrators were n't committed to the town . <p> When the Black Cloud mine closed this year , Forrester and several faculty members were among the first to meet with displaced miners en masse to discuss their options for retraining . As the small town has struggled with an antiquated phone system that routinely scuttles attempts at high-tech enterprises , Forrester has been at the forefront of the fight with state regulators and telecommunications providers . <p> And under Forrester 's watch , the college built a new dormitory and is finishing a scholastic building that will house classrooms , labs and offices . <p> ' We 've gone through about $ 5.5 million worth of construction in the last three years , ' he said . ' That has eased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent part of the community . Now the public is assured that CMC is going to be here for a long time . ' <p> Cheshier , too , has been up to her elbows , transforming scenic Leadville into a media darling with her tireless promotional efforts , landing grants to shore up the decaying old buildings on Harrison Avenue - even selling lemonade at the annual Boom Days celebration . <p> To be sure , she has generated her share of critics , primarily those more interested in maintaining Leadville 's sleepy character , but her enthusiasm and obvious love for the town have been infectious . <p> ' Being the chamber director , people always say , ' You have rose-colored glasses , " the 48-year-old said . ' It 's not that I do n't see the problems , but that I like to see them as challenges and help find solutions . ' <p> Her personal fondness for the town 's century-old Victorians - nearly half of which were boarded up when the couple arrived - led to the creation of the Main Street Board for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main street ( Harrison Avenue ) . We had three of them fall in an 18-month period , ' Cheshier said . ' There were a lot more in danger of collapse . ' <p> The organization has garnered $ 360,000 in grants to renovate dozens of buildings , including the Tabor Opera House , the legacy of legendary Colorado mining king Horace Tabor . <p> The couple admits they wo n't miss the long winters when they move to Pennsylvania , where he will take over as president of the Community College of Beaver County . <p> ' But we 're not leaving because we do n't like the community , ' he said . ' It 's new opportunities and new horizons for us . ' <p> Cheshier has vowed to return for Boom Days , the August mining celebration . ' It 's been a good move for us to live here , ' Cheshier said , tears welling in her eyes at the thought of leaving . <p> For some , leaving Leadville is n't as traumatic . <p> Ed Wisbrun and Bob Alex can hardly conceal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're running in front of the courthouse in Sarasota , Fla. , and their improving golf games . <p> ' I came from El Paso , which is dry and warm , to 10,000 feet , and decided after a couple of years that was n't really a place where I wanted to spend that much more time , ' said Wisbrun , 59 , who operated the Sixth Street Deli and Fox Theater . ' I wanted to play more golf . ' <p> ' The key is , the golf courses down here are open all year , and in Leadville , it 's two months , ' said his business partner , Alex , who ran the highly regarded Prospector Inn for the past eight years but decided to bow out after his son left the business for the Vail valley . <p> ' When he said he was going down the hill and I would have to do it all myself , I just could n't do it , ' Alex said . ' We were working 18 hours a day , six days a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd fall asleep on the 17th hole . Unless you 've got a massive amount of energy , you just ca n't do it . ' <p> The duo says Leadville is a tough place to do business . <p> ' Leadville will probably never grow up from the standpoint that it 's never going to be a Vail or an Aspen , ' Wisbrun said . ' That 's a good thing for preserving its character , but from the standpoint of trying to do business , it becomes a difficulty . ' <p> He noted that his 78-seat theater , small by most standards , was low in priority for getting newly released movies and struggled to make the bulk of its money in the 21/2 months of summer . <p> Alex , 60 , recalled a disastrous Valentine 's Day two years ago . ' We had 160 reservations , and at about 4 it started to snow . About 6 , they closed the road . So here we are , sitting there with food for 160 people , and 20 showed up . ' <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have prompted the Moores to leave town . <p> ' We 're retired , and I want to be a little bit selfish and spend some time attending to things because I just want to . And we feel one of the best ways to do that is to find some place where we 're not involved and not known as joiners and doers , ' the mayor said . ' We just feel it 's time for a change . Periodically , there needs to be a turnover in any community . ' <p> But for every person leaving , there are tales of folks such as Robinson , who passed through Leadville on vacation from Spartanburg , S.C. , two years ago and fell in love with the place , ultimately buying the Mint , a souvenir shop . <p> ' I 'm here kind of by accident , but it 's a wonderful place to be , ' the 37-year-old said . ' There 's a job that has to be done and people willing to do it . '
