<p> The fun side of Atlanta . <p> That 's how Cobb County 's Convention and Visitors Bureau advertises its product , and indeed , life in the northwest Atlanta suburb has taken on a certain quality of late . <p> It started ( or perhaps it simply resumed ) Tuesday , when the County Commission approved a resolution declaring " gay lifestyles " incompatible with community standards . By the end of the week , various commissioners ' lives had been threatened , the county administration offices were on bomb alert and the Lesbian Avengers had announced plans for a " Queer Family Picnic on the Square " in Marietta . <p> Well , now . Does anyone really care that Larry King ca n't manage to land an interview with the resolution 's author , Gordon Wysong ? <p> More to the point , is anyone really surprised that Cobb has become apparently the first county government in America to officially condemn homosexual behavior ? Said Ralston Cox , a former Cobb preservation planner : " Of all the municipal governments in the metro area to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cobb County . It would n't surprise me if they put a wall up along the Chattahoochee . " <p> Mr. Cox still remembers when Cobb officials considered making county ID cards a requirement for riding Cobb Community Transit buses . The bus system , which also goes into Atlanta , was necessary in part because Cobb said " no " to MARTA - just one more example of a political unpredictability that is almost predictable . It was Cobb whose late vote totals dumped Herman Talmadge from the U.S. Senate in 1980 ; and it was Cobb that kept U.S. Rep. Newt Gingrich in the House last year when it seemed that much of his new district wanted him out . Olympic softball will be played practically in Alabama , in part because Cobb voters this summer defeated a bond issue that would have built a world-class stadium . <p> Cobb 's political past is represented by a stretch of Interstate 75 named for deceased U.S. Rep. and John Birch Society President Larry McDonald , and by former Gov . Lester Maddox , a longtime resident who still rides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county in a zoning dispute . In its present are a young man named Steven Clark , the Kmart employee who walloped a 10-year incumbent last year to win a seat in the state House , and Mr. Wysong , who threatened to pull Cobb out of the powerful Atlanta Regional Commission ( ARC ) last summer . <p> Yet even longtime Cobb residents are baffled by these latest moves from the County Commission , which plans to vote Aug. 24 on whether to require that county-funded arts meet " family-oriented standards . " <p> " I 'm at a loss as to why it 's happened , " said Sandra Stephens , who moved from Atlanta to Cobb in 1971 and ca n't believe that the county she considers incredibly diverse has officially excluded one group . " I find myself in the middle as an observer , but I see no rhyme or reason in this . " <p> Mr. Wysong said the anti-gay resolution was meant to send a message on several fronts , including opposition to Atlanta 's domestic partnership benefits and an attempt to bring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a stand on the gays-in-the-military debate , which he calls " an effort to subordinate the national defense of this country to a social agenda . " <p> " Senator Sam Nunn stood up for and protected our vital interest , " Mr. Wysong said . " His courage and his correctness should be endorsed by this community , which shares his views . " <p> Too , Mr. Wysong said , he was concerned about an attempt to attract the Gay Games . " With the current health risks this raises , it is imperative that we as a board renounce this kind of activity because it threatens the safety , health and welfare of the community . It is mind- boggling to imagine what activities constitute ' gay games . ' " <p> County 's gays feel isolated <p> Commission Chairman Bill Byrne insisted last week that the resolution was being misinterpreted . <p> " The resolution reinforces existing community standards as the basis of growth in Cobb County , " Mr. Byrne said . " It is not , it was not , a lambasting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now racists , bigots , mongers and rednecks because we 're singling out one group of people . " <p> But David Mayersky and Noel Lytle said they do feel singled out . <p> " Socially , we 've never encountered any problems here before this , " said Mr. M ayersky , 33 , a financial analyst who owns a house with Mr. Lytle , 36 . " That 's why we moved here two years ago from north Fulton . " <p> While both men said their acquaintances and co-workers are " overwhelmingly " critical of the commission 's actions , they themselves do n't know where they stand in Cobb County . <p> " Does that resolution mean that when I call 911 , they wo n't respond , or the fire department wo n't come when my house is on fire , because I 'm not worthy ? " Mr. Mayersky asked . <p> Meanwhile , over in Powder Springs , Steven Leak is n't entirely happy , either . <p> It 's not that he does n't approve of the commissioners ' stand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to see it snowball before all those little liberal groups start massing their armies against us out here with boycotts , " said Mr. Leak , 40 , who wants a countywide vote on the issues and a way to designate which groups his taxes should go to . " If you could take this question before all 400,000 people on a ballot , the overwhelming majority would say , ' Hurrah for Gordon Wysong and what he 's trying to do . ' " <p> Diversity exposed <p> Ironically , in trying to create a more homogeneous community , Mr. Wysong may simply have exposed Cobb 's vast diversity of backgrounds and attitudes . While Mr. Leak holds firm to his view of the county as " a Bible Belt , predominantly Christian community , " statistics suggest otherwise . Although 22 percent of Cobb residents are Southern Baptists , only half the county reports belonging to any religious denomination . <p> About 44 percent of Cobb residents were born in Georgia , compared with 55 percent in metro Atlanta . And , while the county remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people living in the Marietta and Smyrna area are minorities . <p> So why is Cobb County suddenly being labeled as intolerant and being targeted for everything from protest marches to threatened boycotts of its soon-to-open $ 43 million convention center ? The criticism comes not only from outsiders , such as Michael Goff , editor of Out magazine - who called the commission 's vote , " a huge embarrassment for the state of Georgia " - but also from insiders . <p> " The distressing thing is a debate of this sort brings out the worst in people , " said U.S. Rep. Buddy Darden , a Democrat , who lives in Marietta and said he was " mystified " by the commission 's resolution . <p> " The things the politicians do like this that are so damn dumb , that 's what gets them labeled rednecks by national magazines , " said Marilyn Pennington , who moved to Smyrna in the 1950s . " I regret that the leaders of this county are focusing on issues that are private matters and not putting all of their talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobs - things that really matter to people . " <p> Mr. Wysong and others argue that preserving " family values " also matters to people . Some , like Harry Peacock of east Cobb , saw things spinning out of control when the Atlanta City Council recently passed its domestic partnership ordinance . <p> " I 'm all for stopping anything even headed in that direction , " said Mr. Peacock , 73 . <p> Yet that does n't explain why Cobb is alone in the limelight now . Even before last week 's vote and the resulting critical fallout , no other metro Atlanta county announced that it was considering similar actions on arts funding or " gay lifestyles . " <p> Maybe Cobb really is different . <p> The county always has displayed a fiercely independent streak . In part , observers say , that 's because parts of Cobb are just as old and distinct as Atlanta itself . <p> " Gwinnett and Cobb are more alike than they are different , " said Bart Lewis , chief of socioeconomic analysis for the ARC . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really quite an old city . There are more people in Cobb who have really long-term roots there , second- , third-generation residents of the county . " <p> A liability to growth ? <p> As a result , many of the county 's residents do n't like being told what they can and can not do . More than a decade ago , Kennesaw made international headlines when it passed a law requiring the head of every household to own a gun . <p> A recent study called Cobb 's " go-it-alone attitude " its biggest liability in terms of potential economic development . <p> " Cobb County is seen by many , within the county and in other economic development organizations , as aloof from and relatively uncooperative in regional area development efforts , " the seven-month analysis by the PHH Fantus Co. concluded . <p> Some longtime residents concur . <p> " There 's always been a strong current here that wanted to bypass the mainstream of Atlanta , " Ms. Pennington said . " It 's also fear of having people from other backgrounds come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xenophobia . " <p> Ms. Stephens , the 22-year county resident , thinks some people in Cobb might have worried that crime , broken homes and drug addiction are coming to rest in their own back yards and felt a desperate need to create a quick fix . <p> Ultimately , some people say , the commission 's action may mean the " go it alone " county will end up having to do just that . Mr. Mayersky is but one person who promises to let companies considering setting up shop in Cobb know about the anti-gay resolution . Others wonder whether convention groups will bypass Cobb 's new $ 43 million convention hall . <p> Mr. Wysong dismisses such talk , saying the economic doom forecast for Kennesaw never materialized . In fact , he said , Kennesaw 's population has doubled twice since the gun ordinance was passed . <p> Still , this latest development in Cobb poses some interesting problems for the county and its people . <p> As the national sales director for the Cobb Convention and Visitors Bureau and as a gay man , David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first is boycotts and perpetuating the image of Cobb County as lacking progress and being close-minded , " Mr. McAuley said . " But much more importantly , I 'm concerned on a personal level . How can I sell a county whose community standards I do n't measure up to ? "
