<p> It 's been well more than a month since Hurricane Mitch walloped Central America . <p> Yet the storm 's wrath did n't end with the rains for the shell-shocked people packed like animals inside an emergency shelter at the Leovigildo Cardona Elementary School . <p> In one tiny classroom , a very pregnant Aida Celeste sleeps on a piece of cardboard , without a pillow , on the cold , cement floor . <p> She shares the damp space , which is marked off by desks , boxes and stacks of old clothes , with at least a dozen strangers . <p> Thanks to relief workers , she has all the tins of tuna fish and cans of green beans she could possibly ever want . <p> Now what she really needs is money to rebuild her makeshift house , swallowed by a mudslide during the storm . <p> " I did n't take anything with me when my house fell down ; I just ran for my life , " said Celeste , 23 , a shy , soft-spoken woman with a 2-year-old son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering if I will ever have a place to live . " <p> Her predicament is all too common . <p> Hurricane Mitch meandered over Honduras and neighboring Nicaragua for nearly six days in late October , destroying or damaging tens of thousands of homes and leaving displaced nearly 2 million people , or 40 percent of the population . <p> Most are holed up in the unaffected houses of family and friends . <p> But more than 200,000 people have been herded into temporary shelters , mostly in schools , but also in churches and hospitals . <p> In Tegucigalpa alone , at least 20,000 people have been squeezed into the close confines of 130 shelters , where they live in almost unbearable conditions , with no privacy . <p> In San Pedro Sula , the country 's second-largest city , thousands have been packed into the new soccer stadium , which has been turned into a refugee camp . <p> Cramped quarters force healthy people to live alongside sick ones suffering from rashes , infections and conjunctivitis , and women must sleep beside men they hardly know . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these shelters are closed in January to prepare for the beginning of school in February . <p> Relief workers worry that absolute poverty  --  no home , no income  --  will give these people little choice but to live on the streets . <p> " At some shelters , men who do n't belong there have come in and tried to rape the girls , " said Brenda Martinez , who works for CARE , an Atlanta-based relief organization . " I do n't think anyone has succeeded , but it is just not a good situation for the women . " <p> The Honduran government , with the help of foreign aid , plans over the short term to build at least 3,000 new homes in and around Tegucigalpa , the country 's capital city . <p> But that 's not nearly enough to accommodate the country 's legion of homeless , meaning it may take years before many lives return to normal . <p> At the shelter at the Jorge Roberto Maradiaga Elementary School here , Paula Valladares , 23 , shares a cot and one blanket with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while her husband sleeps on the floor beside them . <p> They live with three other families in a dingy classroom that 's no bigger than a living room in a typical home in the United States . <p> They hang a torn bedspread from the ceiling when they want to discreetly change clothes and heat rice and beans over an open fire . <p> " I used to make tortillas and then sell them for money , but now I do n't have any materials to make tortillas , " said Valladares , who wears one of the few garments she owns , a flimsy , see-through nightgown . " My husband is trying to do some construction work , but I do n't know how we will find money to build a house . " <p> For now , they have no choice but to remain at the school , which provides shelter to more than 120 other people . <p> With no electricity or running water , the smell from six overflowing toilets is almost suffocating . <p> Fortunately , relief workers deliver several barrels of water to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothing by hand , hanging it on ropes to dry in the sun . <p> In the courtyard , dozens of children , many wearing only flip-flops and oversized T-shirts , chase each other and toss a ball back and forth , seemingly oblivious to their surroundings . <p> Babies crawl at their feet , most with runny noses and no diapers . <p> Their parents , on the other hand , look dazed as they sit on the ground swapping stories for the umpteenth time about the torrential downpour that attacked like a biblical plague . <p> " The walls of my house started cracking , and it was nighttime , so it was dark , but still I just knew that the house was going to fall down , " said Olga Vaquis , 22 . " I grabbed my two children out of bed and just started running , and it was muddy and we fell , but we just kept going because we were scared . " <p> Most of the families are from Colonia Soto , a working-class neighborhood overlooking the Choluteca River that virtually buckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm , the community included 800 homes . Today , there are fewer than 50 . <p> Already the second-poorest country in the Western Hemisphere , after Haiti , Honduras bore the brunt of Hurricane Mitch , which killed 10,000 people across Central America . <p> At least 5,657 people are dead , 8,058 are missing , and 12,272 are injured in the Honduras alone . <p> Total losses are estimated at $ 4 billion  --  or roughly the gross domestic product . <p> " In 72 hours , we lost what we had built , little by little , in 50 years , " said Honduran President Carlos Flores Facusse . <p> Food and supplies have poured in from around the world , so much so that relief workers now warn that it could destroy the local market . <p> More goods have been flown in to Central America than during the Berlin Airlift of 1948 , when the United States was forced to drop food from airplanes when the Soviets blocked the German city at the beginning of the Cold War . <p> The U.S. government , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribute supplies and rebuild infrastructure , has handed out 2.3 million pounds of food and 863,000 pounds of medicine in recent weeks . <p> U.S. aid to the region now totals more than $ 280 million . <p> " Certainly the best way to have an immediate impact now is to give a cash contribution because it can be directed toward the most urgent needs , such as providing permanent housing for all those people who need it , " said Mark Schneider , assistant administrator for Latin America for the U.S. Agency for International Development in Washington . <p> That sentiment was echoed by actor-activist Edward James Olmos , who spent five days touring the devastation in Honduras last month . <p> " I 've helped after Hurricane Andrew and other disasters , but this was the worst thing I 've ever seen , " said Olmos , a spokesman for UNICEF . " We have 20 to 30 years of work to do in Honduras to get that country back to where it was just six weeks ago . " <p> Meanwhile , Tegucigalpa , a city of 1.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surface . <p> Burger Kings are bustling with customers , and Nissan dealerships are overflowing with crowds . <p> Water service has been restored to many neighborhoods . <p> But the clifflike hills that ring the city look like they 've been blasted by a bomb , with houses replaced by piles of mud , stones and scattered tiles . <p> Nestled in a bowl-shaped valley , poor migrants for years have built settlements on steep mountains when they could n't afford flatter , safer land . <p> They 've destroyed trees and vegetation to have building sites , fuel to cook with and construction supplies . <p> When the storm hit , the rains triggered landslides along the deforested hills , gobbling up everything in their paths . <p> To prevent a recurrence of this tragedy , a new law has been passed that prohibits the rebuilding of houses in dangerous zones . <p> But it remains to be seen how well this rule can be carried out in a country where so many people are eager to build homes . <p> One person who might have helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move people out of unstable areas but was killed in a helicopter crash last month while surveying the hurricane 's damage . <p> Many businesses and nonprofit groups plan to help with reconstruction efforts . <p> Atlanta-based Home Depot , for example , has given CARE a credit of $ 10,000 for building materials . <p> " But this is going to be a hard , long-term effort because we have to create whole new communities , since we ca n't put people back where they were , " said Marc de Lamotte , CARE 's director in Honduras . " Meanwhile , I ask myself whether I would be able to live with my family in a shelter under such poor conditions , and I really do n't think I could .
