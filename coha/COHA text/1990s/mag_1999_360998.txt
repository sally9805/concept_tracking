Meet three blind mice : an unhappily married thirtysomething couple  --  he 's a nearly successful actor , she 's an actress ignominiously turned brownie baker  --  and their gay best friend , a former dancer who 's now an ineffectual social worker . Smart and smart-alecky , none of them know how to shift the course of their sorry lives . A young stranger shows up at the Los Angeles bungalow they 're temporarily sharing . Secrets are revealed , life choices are examined , change is attempted . With passion and humor , Grant 's sinewy off-Broadway drama digs deep into the souls of characters whose problems are all too universal . An appealing cast performs with perfect pitch . <P>  --  By William Tynan
