Her eccentric spiraling Time LineTen Objects , 1996 , of basswood brightly painted in Lime green , scarlet , saffron and navy , pLayfully hints at Linguistic elements . But the work , incLuded in " Curators " Focus : Turning in Context , " a traveling exhibition that opened this past fall , 1 is installation , not sculpture . Wall-mounted text reLates each hand-size object to a particular year of the 20th century and to events occurring that year . For example , in 1968 Tom Wolfe pubLished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mississippi 's construction ( or deconstruction ) of a symbolic Link between a year and an object is cryptic ; her conscious coupling of text and technique , however , might be seen as emblematic of the entire exhibition . The show was organized by PhiLadeLphia 's Wood Turning Center . The Canadian turner and author Stephen Hogbin , a member of the center 's exhibition committee , suggested the theoretical framework , which is reLated to a book he is writing . Long fascinated by what he calls " quadriform " ideas ( the cardinal directions , the four elements , seasons and so on ) , Hogbin asked each of the show 's four curators to choose one of four perspectives . The PhiLadelphia jeweler and writer Bruce Metcalf , who took on the physical focus , describes turning as " a category of craft that is completely defined by technique . " In a terse but wideranging essay , the turner Maria van Kesteren of the Netherlands discusses emotion , which , she claims , is generated in art by form , particuLarLy the most archetypal form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard Leach of the Mint Museum of Art2 links wood and hand processes to the transcendental spirituality found in nature . And David Revere McFadden of the American Craft Museum , 3 addressing the intellectual aspect of turning , samples the history of writing on the subject and applies it to objects in the show . From 350 entries , the curators jointly selected 51 works by 39 artists from six countries . They did not assign objects to particular categories , and viewers of the show are not likely to do so either . The catalogue essays ( including one by the noted ceramist and educator William Daley and remarks by the Wood Turning Center 's executive director , Albert LeCoff ) are a considerable contribution to the literature of wood turning ; the weight of theoretical material surrounding the work in the show , however , makes for a top-heavy experience . But that 's the catalogue . In the gallery , the velvety yet rigorous birch ply columns of White Bipod , 1995 , by the English turner Richard Hooper , or Peter Pierobon 's ebonized mahogany disk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message in Gregg shorthand-Do You Love Me Because I Am Beautiful , or Am I Beautiful Because You Love Me ? - are soLid , experientialLy rich and intrinsically more engaging than the extracts from the cataLogue posted on the walLs . Gord Peteran , a Canadian , combines the technique of turning with other materiaLs . Untitled So Far , 1996 , is an almost stereotypical turned object resembling an oversize chess piece , but completely encased in fetishistic red Leather . The somewhat phaLlic sheathed form might appear more mysterious and portentous in a show outside the context of turned objects . Here it acts as a provocative foil to the traditional turned object because its character-even the type of wood and proficiency of the turning-is deliberately , and permanently , obscured . The physical-defined by the organizers of the show as " materials and techniques , mind and muscLe " - is the dominant perspective from which the appLied arts have traditionally been considered , but within this exhibition 's strongly conceptuaL model , one might have expected functionaL objects to occupy a minor place . The opposite is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like William Hunter 's cocobolo rosewood spiral-ribbed bowL , Dalbergia Cyclone , 1995 , have supra-functional meaning . Though van Kesteren , in her comments on circlesperhaps the most absolute of geometric shapes-maintains , " In my experience , it is often difficult or impossible to see the aesthetic value of an object through the spiritual veil , " many people find circles or spheres to be spiritual , an intrinsic metaphor for a ritual or eternal cycle delineated by the inward-turning spiral . Hunter 's openwork vessel-the single piece mentioned in each curatorial essay-hints at patterns of cyclic energy : the Cyclone of its title , DNA or twining vines . Traditional shapes are traditional for a reason : they work . Nevertheless , in mediocre hands the formulaic circle can become boring , though that does not happen in this exhibition . In particular , the tiny African blackwood Ball Boxes with Rings , 1994 , by Hans Weissflog of Germany compeLs our admiration through exquisitely calibrated perfection of form , its spheres opening to discLose a contrasting inner structure . Vessels are the predominant form . Ron Kent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wide and sharply conicaL , with an exaggeratedly tiny foot that shows off the artist 's skiLL . A simiLar shape in mixed woods by Mike Shuler is a jazzy bLack , patterned with bLond inLays . Max Krimmel 's formal cupped Vessel #398 , 1996 , is made of veined , almost fleshy , Colorado alabaster delicateLy edged with bloodwood . The asymmetry and elaborate green , burgundy , blue and rust patinas of the leafy copper vesseLs in Helen Shirk 's Sustaining Spirit series are luxurious and oddly poignant in a show distinguished by classic geometries like the tiny lotus-shaped boxwood bowl , 1996 , by Gottfried Bockelmann of Germany . All these works could perform typical container chores , but as with much contemporary craft , they may be meant mostly to be looked at . This is certainly true of Merryll Saylan 's The Breakfast Tray , 1996 , which portrays functional objects but subverts function ; its pa Lely gleaming maple bowL , spoon , cup , and saucer are marveLs of curvaceous proportions , simultaneousLy simplified and subtly exaggerated . Who would pour steaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon by stirring with it ? In contrast , William Leete 's Pepper &; Salt Mills , 1996 , of waLnut and maple , are sLeekly functional as welL as amusing . A second pair of salt and pepper servers , Red Velvet Love Seat , 1994 , by Laura Marth , in which she manipulates anodized aluminum to resemble button-tufted upholstery , is equally functional but even more lighthearted . The four curators are too sophisticated to be seduced by wood that is merely rare and beautiful . It must also be used purposefully , , as it is in Bob Hawks 's pine Norfolk Challenge , 1995 , with its leaflike central motif , or in Dennis Elliott 's Shallow Open Bowl , 1995 , of mapLe burl with a heavy rippling edge . Applied decoration delights in Alan Stirt 's crisp black and blonde Pine Needle Bowl w/Cut Rim , 1996 , incised and painted maple in a randomized , layered V-pattern . The trompe l'oeil surfaces of Lincoln Seitzman 's perfectly scaLed representations of Native American baskets merit a doubLe take , but one is inclined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mimic another materiaL ? Mark Salwasser 's illusionistic Wood Bullets , 1996 , has greater content precisely because the objects depicted lack a real bullet 's lethal potential . References to the human body are almost absent in this show , except for Michael Hosaluk and Mark Sfirri 's grimacing , anthropomorphic orange Trumpot , 1996 , a good-humored Kenny Scharf knockoff in mapLe , baLanced on three ridiculously fragile Legs , or Stoney Lamar 's madrone Muse , 1996 , which seems to have an ear embedded in one of its layered sides . With the exception of works by Marth and Shirk , the metal in this show looks heavy and shiny in contrast to the dominant wood . If traditional metal pieces like Randy Stromsoe 's graceful cream and coffee servers , 1996 , stand out , Boris Bally 's Rep Forms , 1996 , turned from layered recycled aluminum traffic signs , presents an almost brutal contrast to the dominant high-finish aesthetic . For three decades the Wood Turning Center has helped define an increasingly popular field . With this exhibition , it may be that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have outstripped the visions of the artists themselves . My overall impression of this show is that , with some adventurous exceptions-Mississippi , Shirk , Hooper , Bally , Peteran and others-the Lathe is still a tradition-bound tool . This is suggested by the high proportion of functional works , whose predominance must reflect the pool of submissions-not curatorial conservatism . One would hope to see more of the significant and the unexpected in future shows from the center . Footnote 1 .
