A Tintoretto masterpiece is found at a Jesuit residence in Pennsylvania . // JUST A FEW YEARS after the exciting rediscovery of Caravaggio 's " The Taking of Christ " in a Jesuit residence in Dublin , there comes news of yet another rediscovery of a long-lost European masterpiece in a Jesuit house . This time the residence in question is at Wernersville , Pa. , in the former novitiate of the MarylandNew York Province of the Society ofJesus , seven miles west of Reading . The Italian Renaissance masterpiece now newly resurrected is " The Raising of Lazarus , " painted in 1556-57 by Jacopo Robusti ( 1518-94 ) , more commonly known as Tintoretto , one of the greatest painters of late Renaissance Italy and , along with Titian and Veronese , one of three leading masters of 16th-century Venice . That this fairly large canvas ( 42 inches by 58 inches ) , executed with rich , warm colors and in excellent condition , is an authentic Tintoretto is not and has never been doubted . Already listed , well before its disappearance , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , the attribution has now been reconfirmed by Christie 's in New York . Because of its importance and value , the painting has been placed on indefinite loan at the Reading Public Museum . Though there is still much to be uncovered about the origins and subsequent travels of " The Raising of Lazarus , " its subject and style are richly evocative of its time and place in history , the " Serenissima " Republic of Venice during its glorious Golden Age of art . Fortunately , the best documented piece of the canvas 's history is one of its most important , at least for Americans : the journey of Tintoretto 's work across the Atlantic that ended in the Jesuit novitiate at Wernersville . The story takes us back to Rome in the years between the two world wars . On June 8 , 1928 , during the pontificate of Pius XI and the reign of Benito Mussolini , three men-a buyer , a seller and an eyewitness-gathered in Rome to conclude a sizeable business transaction . The business transacted was the sale of Tintoretto 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enrico Pietro Galeazzi , known to subsequent history as Count Galeazzi , one of the closest friends and advisors of the then Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli , the future Pope Pius XII . The buyer was a New York millionaire , Nicholas Frederic Brady , named a papal duke by Pius XI for his numerous benefactions to the Catholic Church . The eyewitness was another American , who signed his name simply as " Frank Spellman . " The latter was , of course , Francis J. Spellman , a young priest from Whitman , Mass. , and future cardinal-archbishop of New York , then successfully maneuvering his way into the upper echelons of both the ecclesiastical and social worlds in Rome . // In the sales receipt , Galeazzi mentions that the painting was " formerly in the collection of Sir William Farrar of London . " Little is known now of this previous English owner of the painting-the name is spelled Farrer , by the way , not Farrar , as is mistakenly listed on the receiptexcept the few bare facts reported by his brief obituary in the London Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lazarus " appears to have been reasonably well known while it was in the Farrer collection , since several catalogues of Tintoretto 's works produced earlier in this century duly list it in the collection . Fatter also loaned the painting for a 1895-96 art exhibition in London . In 1950 , 1977 and 1982 the preeminent Tintoretto scholar of this century , the late Rodolfo Pallucchini recorded " The Raising of Lazarus " in the Brady collection but , unaware of what had become of it , pronounced it missing . As we now know , the Tintoretto was given to the Jesuit novitiate at Wernersville by Mr. Brady and his wife , Genevieve . It is most likely that the Bradys had , in fact , bought the painting in 1928 expressly for the Jesuit novitiate at Wernersville , since they had been shopping for works of art for " their " new novitiate for some time before the opening of that house in 1930 . In any case , after Nicholas and Genevieve died ( in 1930 and 1938 , respectively ) leaving no direct heirs , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connoisseurs were concerned . Indeed , even for the Jesuits the Tintoretto eventually passed , in effect , into oblivion , its original attribution either forgotten or , as was more often the case , simply dismissed as wishful thinking . This past spring , the new superior of the Jesuit center at Wernersville , J. A. Panuska , S.J. , decided that a fresh appraisal and inventory of the Brady art legacy , overlooked in recent years , was in order . He examined the oldest documentation concerning the legacy and was surprised to discover that " The Raising of Lazarus " was indeed unequivocally attributed to Tintoretto . At that point , Alan Kubacki , the center 's business manager , who was assisting Father Panuska in this appraisal and inventory task , enlisted the assistance of Frank Ricci , an official from the nearby Reading Public Museum . Noting the Tintoretto , Mr. Ricci called on Christie 's of New York , whose old master specialist , Sarah Lidsey , was able to reconfirm the attribution of the canvas as an authentic Tintoretto . ALTHOUGH TODAY THERE ARE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rediscovery of " The Raising of Lazarus " is nonetheless genuine cause for celebration , in light of both the Venetian master 's importance in the annals of European art and the high technical quality and striking visual beauty of this specific canvas . To understand fully Tintoretto 's importance and appreciate art lovers ' enthusiasm for his work , one needs to go to Venice , where most of the artist 's best works are still in situ . In the United States there are roughly two dozen Tintorettos , but few are equal in beauty to this newly resurrected " Lazarus . " A glimpse at this work will give American viewers a taste of what awaits them in Venice . Tintoretto 's style was to evolve gradually over time and to some degree varied from canvas to canvas , depending on the painting 's subject matter and immediate destination , but it is sometimes described in a shorthand manner as a " mixture of Titian 's colors with Michelangelo 's figures . " A penchant for what the art historian Peter Humphrey calls the " unashamedly theatrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tintoretto 's most characteristic works confront and envelop the viewer with crowded , complex and spatially idiosyncratic compositions . These works are executed with a sumptuous , earthy , though subdued and limited palette and a powerful , mystery-invoking chiaroscuro . A devout man , Tintoretto preferred working on religious narrative scenes , especially those depicting acts of divine and miraculous intervention . His ultimate goal in this was neither theatricalism nor realism , but poignant religious emotion and a deep sense of the sacred . As the art historian Michael Levey has remarked , in the quintessential Tintoretto canvas " an angel , a saint or Christ himself plunges into our world , and brings consolation , salvation , light , to Someone afflicted or in darkness . Such interventions must disturb and amaze . It is Tintoretto 's aim , and his achievement , to make such emotions fly out from the canvas at us , the spectators , and bring us to our knees before the miracle . " For Tintoretto , as the art historian David Rosand observes , the act of painting was often " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the greatest in Jesus ' public ministry-is that depicted in the Wernersville Tintoretto , the raising from the dead of his beloved friend Lazarus of Bethany , brother of Martha and Mary ( Jn. 11:1-43 ) . In Tintoretto 's canvas we see Lazar-us , already released from his burial bindings , slowly arising to new life , emerging from a diagonally positioned sarcophagus , around which crowd an arching swirl of figures . Among the attendant figures are the resurrected man 's two sisters : the blond , elegantly garbed Mary kneels on the left ( Jn. 11:32 ) , her hands crossed piously over her heart , while Martha stands at the right , her wide-flung arms and marveling gaze expressing joy at this miraculous answer to her prayer and that of her sister . All of these figures incline to the left , as if drawn by a magnet , toward the solitary figure of Jesus , who extends his right hand in blessing . Though not idealized , the main characters are all elegantly wrought and somewhat rhetorically posed figures , and all bathed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject several times during his career . But this comes as no surprise . The raising of Lazarus was one of the most popular New Testament subjects in Christian art from its very beginnings in the catacombs . Not only was it the greatest miracle performed by Jesus , a demonstration of his power to overcome death itself ; it was also an inspiring source of hope to early Christians-a guarantee , in the face of martyrdom and persecution , of their own resurrection . The miracle was also important for its connection to one of the defining tenets of the Christian faith : actual bodily resurrection . The Church Fathers and other theological magistri had spent much time pondering the details and implications of the episode , particularly as they related to the eternal destiny of Christian bodies . In addition , as we read in sermons and other bestselling spiritual literature of Tintoretto 's century and before , the raising of Lazarus demonstrated the efficacy of prayer , for when Martha and Mary " knocked , " Jesus " opened the door . " But well beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to hold great appeal for Catholic art and devotion . Beginning in the I I th century , " Saint Lazarus " acquired a new life and a new role as heavenly protector against attacks of leprosy and the plague . The reason for this association is to be found in medieval legend , which melded the identity of the resurrected Lazarus of John 's Gospel with that of the poor , sore-covered beggar of the same name in Jesus ' parable ( Lk. 16:19-3 1 ) . Though leprosy gradually died out in Europe , outbreaks of the bubonic plague continued steadily and devastatingly for centuries , well beyond Tintoretto 's lifetime , especially in the busy international seaport of Venice . In fact , the years 1556-57-the dates assigned to this canvas by Pallucchini for technical , stylistic reasonscoincide with another appearance of the plague in the city that took thousands of victims during its brief visitation . Utterly impotent in the face of this repeated scourge , the government and citizens of Venice turned toward heaven , seeking comfort and help from God and from saintly intercessors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art like Tintoretto 's , depicting the miraculous raising of Lazarus from the dead , the Venetians found hope and strength to persevere in the face of the merciless scourges of life . These paintings reminded them that even if their prayers for immediate release from sickness and death were not answered , there was nonetheless the promise of a greater destiny , of a joyful new life " in the bosom of Abraham , " where there would be no more sorrow , tears or death . In this respect , as a poignant , visual reminder of one of the eternal truths of Christianity and in the face of the new merciless and yet unconquered " plagues " of our own century , such as AIDS , Tintoretto 's " The Raising of Lazarus " remains as emotionally alive and as spiritually relevant to us today as it was to the Venetians who first gazed upon it in the 16th century .
