The broad , granitetopped peninsula angling from the wall in Flo Braker 's remodeled kitchen makes a sleek , hardworking room divider . One side functions as an informal breakfast area ; the other is all business , because that 's where Braker creates the elegant pastries that are the stars of her cookbooks . The top measures 4 feet wide and more than 11 feet long-providing ample room for bowls , mixers , rolled-out dough , and baking sheets . The polished-granite surface , which is preferred for working with dough because of its cool temperature , smoothness , low adhesion rate , and ease of cleaning , is 35 inches above the floor-a comfortable height for Braker to roll out cookies and pie crusts . ( The rest of the kitchen 's extra-wide granite counters stand 37 inches tall-the change in level is visible beside the electric mixers . ) An electric oven is built into the end of the peninsula , but the kitchen also contains one gas and one convection oven . The tools of Braker 's trade-mixers , blenders , knives , bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen gadgets-line the backs of the counters . " I did n't want garages . I wanted everything to be seen , " she explains . There is , however , one bit of whimsy in Braker 's kitchen : a trompe l'oeil painting of open shelves filled with jars and baked treats covering the wall behind the peninsula . Artist Jan Meyer left room for a real wallmounted clock , which only adds to the painting 's three-dimensional illusion . Below the painting and to the right is a slender wood-and-glass-fronted cabinet ( partially visible in the photograph ) designed to hold Braker 's large collection of miniature tart forms . inventions Cookie baking is at full throttle during the holidays , and in most homes there never seems to be enough room for those broad baking sheets where you need them most-near the oven . This 35-inch-tall , roll-around island relieves the space shortage with a vertical storage system : it neatly stacks as many as 17 baking sheets .

The maple chopping-block top , which measures 203/4 by 332 inches , makes a handy work surface even when baking is not involved . Cabinetmaker Dave Pedersen of Pedersen Woodworks in Redwood City , California , built the island to Braker 's specifications . Flour power in a drawer The drawer below pulls its own weight-and then some ! Three little acrylic windows built into the drawer front hint at its contents and echo the " divided-light " design of the cabinet doors elsewhere in the kitchen . The windows-two displaying different kinds of flour and one showing granulated sugar-turn out to be false fronts masking a much larger array of baking supplies , which you see only when the drawer rolls open . The 24-inch-wide , 30-inch-long , 4Y4inch-deep drawer is divided into compartments that are separated and ( in some cases ) covered by lengths of clear acrylic . The front section has three covered bins sized to hold 5-pound bags of allpurpose flour , cake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with small jars and cans of baking powder , baking soda , salt , and vanilla . A drawer-wide bay at the center holds hinged-top glass jars containing light and dark brown sugar , powdered sugar , and cornstarch . At the back of the drawer are two covered bins for pastry and bread flour . The Western Home Notebook Flo Braker , author of The Simple Art of Perfect Baking ( Chapters Publishing , Shelburne , Vermont , 1992 ; $19.95 ) , Sweet Miniatures ( William Morrow , New York , 1991 ; $25 ) , and a baking column in the San Francisco Chronicle , is , to put it mildly , an avid baker . " Her kitchen , where she cooks for home and does her story development , is without a doubt the most beautiful and best thought-out kitchen I 've seen . " That 's how Sunset senior food writer Elaine Johnson described Braker 's kitchen to me . My curiosity was piqued . I met with Braker in her Palo Alto home and immediately saw many details in her kitchen that readers could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multilevel work surfaces , clever storage spaces , imaginative display ideas , and baking paraphernalia ( more than I 'd ever seen in one place ) , all told me that this was a food-lover 's gold mine . She and designer Nancy Cowall Cutler of Palo Alto have thoughtfully designed every inch of the remodeled space . We thought it would be fun to make her kitchen the focus of this month 's Home Guide . The only trouble is that there were too many great ideas , so you 'll see more in future issues . You can also find some of her favorite cookie recipes on page 126 of this issue . EQUIPMENT Photograph Photograph // Serious stainless A professional cook needs professional-quality equipment , and the cooking area of Flo Braker 's kitchen has all the bells and whistles you 'd expect in a small gourmet restaurant . A custom-built , canopy-shaped stainless steel hood curves over a sixburner Wolf gas range and an adjacent gas grill . Beneath the hood are infrared warming lamps positioned above a metal shelf . A bar for hanging pots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Also hanging from the bar is a pot filler , by Fisher : the J-shaped spout attached to a long flexible metal hose and faucet is used to fill pots for cooking pasta . For continuity 's sake , the restaurant-grade appliances-including the range , a Gaggenau convection oven , glass-fronted Traulsen refrigerator , and under-the-counter Sub-Zero freezer-are stainless steel , as is the backsplash area behind the range . Pots of whisks , spoons , and spatulas , as well as bottles of oils , cooking wines , and vinegars , stand within reach of the cooktop . Below the counter are deep drawers and shelves for pots and pans . The drawers move on heavy-duty , fullextension glides . Each of the deeper drawers has two stacked fronts with two drawer pulls to maintain consistent proportions . DETAILS No running eggs A simple detail keeps eggs-both real and decorative-in their place on the speckled-granite countertop . A shallow , egg-wide ( 1 1/4 inches ) trough machined into the surface stops any ovoid wanderers . ART in the WESTERN HOME Racks and rollers Some cooks collect salt and pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling pins . Indeed , some rolling pins are a form of functional sculpture . Her colorful collection includes a variety of slender shapes-some textured with scored lines , some made with different types of hardwoods , and some formed out of hollow glass tubes . Braker and Dave Pedersen designed 21 wall-mounted brackets to give her favorite rolling pins a starring role . Each bracket consists of a length of aluminum L-channel and a 3- by 23-inch piece of maple with a 2-inch-wide groove shaped into it . The channels are screwed to a panel of plywood masking the side of the refrigerator and the underside of the wood . The wood supports are held slightly away from the plywood to make the brackets appear to float . Photograph Photograph Photograph // <p>
