If every artistic genre has a grand , sweeping version , it also has a smaller , more delicate form . In music , there is the symphony , and there is also the song . In painting , there is the mural , and there is also the miniature . There are epic poems , and on the other end of the scale , there are haiku . In dramatic writing , there is the full length play , and there is the monologue . The song , miniature , haiku , or monologue is not easier to create just because it is less ambitious in scale . In fact , these smaller forms of art are often more challenging ; there is less room for error . For example , in a haiku , every syllable counts-literally . The monologues that appear on the following pages are not excerpts from longer works ; they were written to stand alone . The monologue presents the playwright with the challenge of making one person-one voice , one bodyexpress a full range of human emotion . In these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playwrights Romulus Linney and Brian Friel succeed beautifully . GOLD AND SILVER WALTZ BY ROMULUS LINNEY With a spotlight , the waltz plays its opening phrases .

On the day I came back to the 7th grade , with my father buried in cold ground far away from me , and Martha Miller walked straight up to me and said she was so sorry my father was dead ! But that while we 'd been gone the grass in our front yard had n't been cut and she wanted me to see about that right away or it would go wild get overgrown more tangled up than it already was I told E.C . that and he said , " Yes , that sounds like her she was always a sensible girl , practical and encouraging " So We went on through all the rest of them , the Murray Siddens and Mary Jean Coles and everybody else and said Goodbye .

Exit Romulus Linney ) ABOUT " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waltz " was written in 1902 bv Austrian composer Franz Lehar . Lehar , who was born in Hungary in 1870 , earned worldwide fame as a composer of operettas-short operatic works that often included spoken dialogue and dancing . Lehar composed " The Gold and Silver Waltz " for an annual charity event sponsored by the Austrian Princess Pauline Metternich-Sandor . Like most of his other works , the waltz is a sparkling celebration of festivity. : Lehar died in 1948 , leaving a legacy of thirty stage works , many songs and orchestral items . A Closer Look 1 Why is this piece called " The Gold and Silver Waltz " ? What does the music add to the tone and meaning of the monologue ? 2 Why does Martha instruct Rommy to cut the grass ? Why does he repeat this instruction to himself later ? AMERICAN WELCOME BY BRIAN FRIEL A hotel lobby . Piped music in background . Two chairs , one on each side of a small table . On one chair sits the European , a large brown envelope on his lap . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying a briefcase . He looks around , spots the European , bears down on him . The American is young . He speaks very rapidly and gives excessive emphasis to several words in each sentence . American : It is Mr. Smith , is n't it ? Mr. John Smith ? I 'd recognize that distinguished head anywhere ! I 'm Bert-remember ? We 've corresponded . I 'm directing your play . Welcome , sir ! Welcome to America ! ( THEY shake hands . ) American : No-no . Do n't get up-please . ( He sits . ) May I ? Well ! You 've made it ! You 're here ! Gosh ! And may I tell you , sir , how honored and how privileged we are to have you here with us . I 'm sure you 're still groggy with jet lag , are you ? Can I get you something to eat , something to drink ? How 's your hotel ? Had you a good flight ? Can I get you a coffee ? Tea ? Beer ? May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a personal comment ? You look so European-it 's uncanny ! ( Without breaking his speech he opens his briefcase and takes out a script and a large note-block . ) Wonderfil . Okay . Let 's get down to business . But before we do , Jim , may I tell you just once more how magnificent , how truly magnificent your play is-I mean that - and how honored and privileged I am to be associated with it . I really mean that . You see , Bill , what you have given us is a perfectly conceived and perfectly executed analysis of the human condition the world over . It 's so perfect it-it-it 's frightening . Beautiful form . Electrifying language . Subtle wit . Penetrating insights . I mean to say that 's art-that 's real artthat 's European art , if you know what I mean . What I 'm trying to say , Tom , is this : you have entrusted me with this delicate perfection-and I 'm scared . I say to myself : Bert , can you handle it ? Are you worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something ? Coffee ? Tea ? Beer ? Okay . Fine . What have I got here ? A few questions . Do you mind if I ask you a few silly questions ? Just for my own enlightenment . I knew you would n't mind . And may I tell you , Chuck , how honored and how privileged we are to have you here with us ? First problem : language . Frankly we 're uneasy with the language-it 's just that there 's a lot of it we do n't understand . Simply a question of usage : or to be more accurate , simply a question of our ignorance of your usage . I 've made a list here-words like " boot , " bumper , " " chemist " there are maybe a dozen of them . Frankly we do n't know what you mean . And since you want to communicate with American audiences and since we want them to understand you , I mean to say what we did was this . We went to our most distinguished American playwright-and you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adores your work-and what he did for us was this . He took all those little confusing words-five or six thousand approximately-and with wonderful delicacy and skill and with the utmost respect for the rhythms and tones of your speech , he did this most beautiful job of translating the play into the language we speak and understand . I hope you 'll approve . I know you 'll approve . Can I get you something ? Coffee ? Tea ? Beer ? Gosh ! I really ca n't believe it , Mike ! You 're actually here ! Pm just knocked-out ! Okay . Second problem : the form of your play . We 're uneasy with the form . I mean to say we 're not uneasy with the formit 's just that you 've written this wonderful naturalistic play but you 've written it in monologue form ! A naturalistic play in monologue form , for God 's sake ! I mean to say a monologue is just not naturalistic if you do n't mind my saying so . Let me qualify that instantly . The monologue may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to us . We talk , we exchange , we communicate . And since you want to communicate with American audiences and since we want them to understand you , I mean to say what we did was this . We went to our most distinguished American playwright-and you 've got to meet him while you 're here ; he just reveres your work-and what he did for us was this . He took your little monologue and with wonderful delicacy and skill and with the utmost respect for the rhythms and tones of your speech , he did this most beautiful job of transforming your script into a four-character , twoact , single-set comedy that is just-how can I tell you ? - just breathtaking . I hope you 'll approve . I know you 'll approve . You 're suffering from jet-lag-I can see it . Can I get you something ? Gin ? Whisky ? Brandy ? Gosh ! I really ca n't believe it , Dan ! You 're actually here ! I 'm just knocked-out ! ( He sits back , relaxes , smiles contentedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it ? And here we are , all set to go . And let me tell you this . We think-heck , we know ! - that we 've got the most distinguished , the funniest , the most sensitive , the most disturbing , the most enlightening and the most moving play of the season-a big , big , big hit that is going to make us all rich and famous . And may I tell you once more how honored and how privileged we are to have you here with us . May I shake that distinguished hand again ? Welcome , Tony Brown , welcome to America ! ( He takes the European 's hand and pumps it with enthusiasm . ) A Closer Look 1 What is the speaker 's tone ? What is he trying to achieve in his conversation with the playwright ? What kind of person does he seem to be ? 2 What details suggest the playwrights reaction to what he is hearing ? What emotions does he seem to be experiencing ? Photograph Footnote Editor 's Note Footnote In the dedication to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Romulus Linney notes that he was an actor before he became a writer . He adds , " I often wondered to what degree I remained an actor , acting the part of a writer . " If he is acting as he writes , then Linney is brilliantly cast , having written three novels , thirteen long and twenty-tvo short plays . Linney 's many awards include a 1992 Obie Award for sustained excellence in playwriting . Footnote Editors Note Footnote Brian Friel was born in Northern Ireland in 1929 . Though he has published several collections of short stories , it is his many plays that have brought Friel widespread acclaim . His 1992 Tony Award-winning play Dancing at Lughnasa , a fictionalized account of Friel 's boyhood , was adapted for the big screen in 1998 . Friel 's other plays include Philadelphia , Here I Come ! , The Freedom of the City , Faith Healer , and Aristocrats , which won the Best Foreign Play Award from the New York Drama Critics Circle in 1989 . <p>         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
