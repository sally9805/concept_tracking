When The Thomas Crown Affair first appeared in 1968 , its most memorable scene was a sexually charged chess game between Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway . Audiences will feel rooked by the remake  --  it lacks the original 's kitschy cool  --  but they 'll surely remember " the Dress " : a black peekaboo number worn by Rene Russo that is snug as a body stocking and virtually transparent . Like the diaphanous gown Marilyn Monroe donned for J.F.K. 's birthday , Russo 's outfit is a sheer delight . " The costume designer just brought it in one day , folded up to the size of a handkerchief , " recalls Russo , who gazed through the gossamer and asked , " Why do n't you just paint some glitter on my body instead ?
