IT WAS A MOST UNSEASONAL ACT . DAYS BEFORE Christmas and with immediate effect , President F.W. De Klerk suspended or retired 23 of South Africa 's top officers , including two generals and four brigadiers . All are under suspicion of clandestine activities  --  some involving hit-squad murders  --  designed to undermine his political reforms . De Klerk dismissed talk of an attempted military coup , saying there was no threat to South Africa 's security . But criminal charges could follow next year . " We 're not dealing with kids , " he said . <P> All year long , De Klerk 's credibility has been battered by charges of dirty dealings within his defense forces . Thus his crackdown on these mavericks has almost certainly scored him some valuable points  --  enough , perhaps , that in spite of enduring a year of violence , crime and political stalemate , South Africans are beginning to see hope for l993 . " We are closing the year on a high note , " Nelson Mandela told the Sowetan , Johannesburg 's black newspaper .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
