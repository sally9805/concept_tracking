<p> Years ago , American cars were a fairly common sight in Southeast Asia . Now , except for the wheezing relics that still ply the roads of such relative backwaters as the capital of Myanmar and southern Vietnam , they are hard to find . And even in those places , they are rapidly being replaced by shiny new Nissans and Toyotas . <p> The abandonment by American automakers of potentially lucrative markets in Southeast Asia reflects a mindset that U.S. government officials and businessmen say is shared by many American companies : a preoccupation with domestic sales at the expense of exports . At the same time , they say , efforts to remedy the situation by prying open the Japanese market may amount to barking up the wrong tree . <p> " The growth market in Asia for automobiles is Southeast Asia , not Japan , " said Michael Dunne , an American automotive consultant at the Bangkok-based Southeast Asia Management and Investment Co . " Between 1988 and 1990 , Thailand 's auto market grew by 40 percent per year . " Compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 percent to 2 percent during that period , he said , " that 's phenomenal . " <p> Indeed , said Robert D. Orr , the U.S. ambassador to Singapore , " we spend so much time trying to open up the Japanese market that we almost totally overlook the fact that the Japanese are everywhere selling their products . They consider the world as their marketplace . " <p> In an effort to awaken American companies to trade opportunities around the region , Orr and four other U.S. ambassadors are making an unprecedented tour of the United States this month . The group , including the envoys to Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand and the Philippines , is to visit Portland , Chicago , Detroit , Atlanta , Houston and Washington during the 11-day trip starting Saturday . <p> " We hope it will have a consciousness-raising effect , " said a U.S. official in the Philippines . " The ambassadors will be the barkers to get people into the tent . " <p> At the core of the trip is a perception that the United States needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's so difficult to talk American business people into exporting , " said Orr , a former governor of Indiana . " They 're so addicted to our great big beautiful market . " <p> Although U.S. exports have been rising in recent years , he said , they accounted for only 7.2 percent of GNP in 1990 , compared to an average of 19 percent among major competing nations . <p> " If we were to double our exports , there would n't be a recession right now , " Orr said . <p> Together , the countries that make up the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN )  --  Indonesia , Malaysia , Thailand , the Philippines , Singapore and Brunei  --  represent a market of 320 million people with a growth rate that has averaged 7.25 percent over the last two years . And the market is relatively open . <p> " Market access is just not the problem that it is in Northeast Asia , " said one U.S. commercial officer in the region . Whereas non-tariff barriers and other protectionist mechanisms often discourage U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korea , he said , " it 's not that difficult to do business here . " <p> Still , he added , developing trade relationships with Southeast Asia requires an investment of time and effort that some American firms seem to ignore . <p> " We still get a lot of U.S. companies that think they can do it all by mail , " the official said . " The good news is that the market is open . The bad news is that it 's not an automatic sale . If you want a long-term relationship , you have to build it . " <p> Generally , U.S. government and corporate officials say , it is not the American industrial giants such as IBM and Exxon that need coaxing to venture into the Far East , but the smaller " middle class " of corporate America . <p> According to Jack Hanlon , co-chairman of the Investment Promotion Committee of the American Chamber of Commerce in Thailand , 80 percent of U.S. foreign investment is done by no more than 100 major firms . " The rest have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I think it 's just xenophobia on the part of the U.S. businesses . It will take a tough , uphill fight to get small businesses to take advantage of their opportunities here . " <p> A prime example of lost opportunity is what many U.S. businessmen regard as Detroit 's neglect of its export markets . With economic prospects looking fairly bleak after the communist takeovers of South Vietnam , Cambodia and Laos in 1975 , General Motors and Ford virtually pulled out of Southeast Asia , leaving the field open for the Japanese . <p> " Years and years ago , you used to see American cars all over the place , " a U.S. business executive in Manila said . " Where did they all go ? The American automakers concentrated on the U.S. market and they neglected the rest of the world . It 's their own fault . " <p> Certainly , the U.S. auto market dwarfs those of Southeast Asia . The United States produces 6.5 million new units a year , compared to about 300,000 in Thailand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , Dunne said , " if you look at the whole region , it 's a very attractive place for investment . " China 's market is about 700,000 new cars a year and Taiwan 's is another 500,000 , he noted . " Add all this up , along with the vast potential for growth , and there 's every reason for American automobile manufacturers to be more aggressive out here , " Dunne said . <p> Today , Japanese companies control about 90 percent of the market for commercial vehicles and 85 percent for passenger cars throughout Southeast Asia , Dunne said . U.S. companies have less than 1 percent of the market share , with European manufacturers making up the rest . <p> " American automakers always have an excuse for not competing , " Dunne said . " Meanwhile , the Japanese just eat it up . Local partners are not thrilled about being dependent on the Japanese . They 'd like to work more with Americans . " <p> Part of the problem is that , like the Japanese , most Southeast Asians drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in ASEAN is the Philippines , but even in that former U.S. colony the automobile market has long since succumbed to the Japanese onslaught . <p> Dominating the protected Philippine market are car and truck assembly plants controlled by Nissan , Toyota and Mitsubishi . The latest entry is a South Korean firm , Kia , which has begun assembling a model called the Kia Pride . <p> In Malaysia , a Mazda model called the Telstar is assembled by Ford , which owns 25 percent of Mazda . But the bulk of the market is held by a Malaysian car , the Proton Saga , the only indigenous auto in the region . Although it uses a Mitsubishi Lancer chassis , the body is Malaysia 's own design and about 60 percent of the content is locally made . <p> Ford 's strongest presence in the area is on Taiwan , where the company eventually hopes to make cars for export to mainland China . <p> Other U.S. automakers also are starting to take a second look at the region . Chrysler opened an office in Thailand in 1990 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In an effort to boost its meager market share , General Motors has set up offices in Hong Kong and Thailand , a joint venture in Shenyang , China , and wholly owned subsidiaries in Taiwan and Indonesia . <p> According to American officials , some of the best opportunities for U.S. business in Southeast Asia lie in such sectors as computers and peripherals , food processing and packaging machinery , aircraft and avionics , telecommunications gear , health care and pollution-control technology , management services , and oil and gas equipment . <p> Relatively low labor costs and a growing pool of technicians and middle managers make the region attractive for foreign investment . However , new investments by U.S. firms in recent years have been lagging behind those of Japan , Hong Kong and Taiwan . <p> The major obstacle to increased American trade and investment in Southeast Asia , U.S. officials say , is intellectual property rights . The worst offender in the region is Thailand , where the counterfeiting of everything including designer watches , videotapes and computer software is a growth industry . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , it is estimated that only 5 percent of the software sold in the country is legal . <p> For many companies , the new frontier in the area is Vietnam . Government efforts to attract foreign investment , a cheap and relatively well-educated labor force and the prospect of new offshore oil discoveries have fueled intense interest by Asian and European businessmen . American firms have been lobbying Washington to lift its economic embargo on the country so that they can compete , especially in the oil sector . <p> Within ASEAN , the United States has been running trade deficits with every country except tiny , oil-rich Brunei . But the total deficit with ASEAN of nearly $ 7.4 billion for the first 11 months of 1991 is small compared with the $ 66 billion deficit in U.S. trade over the same period with the rest of East Asia and the Pacific . The figure includes negative balances of $ 9 billion with Taiwan , $ 11.6 billion with China and nearly $ 39 billion with Japan . <p> In its efforts to promote exports , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to American firms at nominal cost . But the facilities are relatively modest compared to those of some foreign competitors . <p> " The South Koreans have as many trade offices overseas as we do , " a U.S. commercial officer said .
