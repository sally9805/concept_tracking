<p> DeMarcus Yarborough had spent hours on the witness stand in D.C. Superior Court , telling his attorney  --  and then the prosecutor  --  that he fired in self-defense the night he shot and killed a 16-year-old boy . But even when the lawyers sat down , he was n't through answering questions . <p> " Did you fire your gun first ? " one of the 12 jurors wanted to know . Defense attorney William R. Martin held his breath , thinking that it was a very good question and wondering whether the answer would blow a hole in his carefully constructed case . <p> " I really do n't know , " Yarborough replied , and Martin relaxed a little . <p> " Do you know what type of gun was pointed at you ? " another juror wondered . Yarborough did n't . <p> " Had you ever fired a gun before ? " was the question from a third juror . Only once , when he was in the Boy Scouts . There were more than two dozen questions for Yarborough , gleaned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T. Washington , who read them aloud . <p> Although the practice is still rare  --  used by about 1 percent of federal , state and local judges in the country and only a few in the Washington area  --  allowing jurors to question witnesses is being touted as the next big step in judicial reform . <p> " It 's the truth we 're after , " jury foreman Donald Green said after Yarborough 's trial . " Being able to ask questions helped us keep our attention . " The panel voted to acquit Yarborough , 30 , of killing Donald Brinkley in a parking lot with a gun he grabbed from a friend 's house , believing Brinkley was stealing his truck . <p> More than 5 million Americans are summoned for jury duty each year , including 103,000 in Washington and its suburbs . Reformers contend that jurors should be more involved in trials , instead of sitting passively while the judge and lawyers dictate what they will be told , by whom and when . <p> " We know not all of the questions can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thinking , " said B. Michael Dann , a Phoenix judge who shepherded jury reform in Arizona , where asking questions is part of a jurors ' bill of rights . He says courtrooms should be more like classrooms  --  with jurors taking notes , discussing the case among themselves and raising questions . <p> " It helps comprehension , " Dann said . " Question-asking can make deliberations more efficient . Jurors can get right to the jugular . " <p> But critics say the practice has several drawbacks , including making trials longer . They worry that it could turn jurors into crusaders who form opinions well before they reach deliberations . They also say jurors may feel obliged to perform instead of concentrating on the case . <p> " It just takes too much time away from the trial , " said Chief Judge F. Bruce Bach , of Fairfax County Circuit Court . " You start generating a number of questions , most of which are going to be answered anyway " or ca n't be asked for legal reasons . <p> " Jurors should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deliberate and decide . They should not be players in the drama . " <p> Colin Dunham , president of the Independent Public Defender Association , a group of Washington criminal defense lawyers , says joining the interrogation " turns jurors into advocates . It taints their ability to be neutral fact-finders . When they start asking questions , they 're asking with a particular point of view or perspective . " <p> " You work very hard to keep certain information out of the trial , " he said . " Then all of your finesse and art and technique are thrown out the window when a juror comes in and asks , ' Where were you on the night in question ? ' " <p> The process works like this : Jurors are told at the start of proceedings that they can submit written questions at the end of each witness 's testimony . Out of the jury 's earshot , the judge and lawyers determine which questions are inadmissible , irrelevant or prejudicial . The judge asks the rest . <p> Most courts  --  including those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges to decide whether juries can raise questions . Most appellate rulings have upheld the procedure , although some have cautioned that the question-asking must be done in a controlled manner . <p> For now , judges who permit the practice are few and far between  --  roughly 1 percent , according to one national study . But Dann said the change is " picking up steam " and generating much discussion at judicial conferences . Only a few years ago , few judges permitted jurors to take notes ; now jurors routinely are given pencils and notebooks to help them recall testimony . <p> The American Bar Association and the National Center for State Courts are studying the issue , as is the Council for Court Excellence , a Washington-based nonprofit civic group that works with local and federal courts . <p> Henry F. Greene , a D.C. Superior Court judge , said jurors appreciate the opportunity , even though they do n't always use it . Sometimes a few questions are asked of witnesses , and sometimes , as in Yarborough 's trial , more than 100 are submitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 14 years , surveys them periodically . Nine of 10 report that the practice was helpful . But one offered this caution : " We all would like to be Perry Mason . " <p> Greene and other judges advise jurors that their questions must seek information only and must not be aimed at discrediting or arguing with witnesses . When questions are not asked , jurors are told not to guess or speculate why . <p> " They ask basic questions  --  Was the door open ? Were the street lights on ?  --  very practical things , " said Gregory E. Mize , also a D.C. Superior Court judge , who has permitted questions to be asked at civil as well as criminal trials . <p> Michie Hunt , who recently served on a jury in a murder case in D.C. Superior Court , said being able to ask questions " was really critical in getting the information we needed to make a decision . It stimulates your thinking . I would say to myself , ' I want to find out about this . ' I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , and I would ask my questions when I got the chance . " <p> Assistant U.S. Attorney Douglas F. Gansler said the jury 's questions helped him win a conviction last month against Anthony Jamal Tucker , 20 , who was accused of killing his girlfriend in December . Tucker said the gun fired accidentally . Jurors had numerous questions about how the firearm worked and eventually found Tucker guilty of second-degree murder . <p> Gansler said he challenged Tucker 's account in his closing argument by focusing on the firearms issue . " If you believe the jury should know everything and have the full truth , you 'd be for the process , " he said . <p> In general , prosecutors seem more enthusiastic about it than defense lawyers . Shawn Moore , a Washington defense lawyer , said he is convinced that prosecutors benefit most . " It alerts prosecutors to gaps in the presentation of their case , " he said . " It helps them fill in the holes . " <p> But Bernard Grimm , who , like Moore , handles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in holes , too . " It gives you a barometer of what goes on with the jury . Especially in a long trial , it helps you know what the jury is thinking . You can make some adjustments , " he said . " If the questions seem favorable to the defense , you might decide to take risks that you might not have taken . " <p> The latest local judge to embrace the concept is Reggie B. Walton , who for years had argued against the practice with his colleagues at D.C. Superior Court . Walton is permitting the jury to ask questions in the trial of Rose Young , who is accused of killing her 23-month-old son last summer . <p> He shocked lawyers on both sides when he announced his intention to permit questions , to the point where defense lawyer David Sidbury gasped . <p> " Oh , sorry  --  I did n't mean to react , judge , " Sidbury said . <p> " I know lawyers do n't like it , " Walton replied . " As an advocate , I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurors ask questions and destroy my best-laid tactical plan . But I 'm getting to the point where I believe the sporting match we sometimes play does n't serve the public well . "
