A pioneering L.A. legal squad turns the tables on predators who stalk human prey // Answering the knock on the door of his Reseda apartment at 7 a.m. , Greg Steigerwald finds two Los Angeles detectives in bulletproof vests . " What did I do ? " demands Steigerwald , 33 , as the cops slap on handcuffs and put him in their unmarked car . His crime : violating a restraining order forbidding him from contact with a woman he dated . Steigerwald starts to shake . " Am I being arrested , " he cries , " for being in love ? " Not exactly . The officers at Steigerwald 's home are no ordinary cops . They represent the country 's premier antistalking squad , a unit of the LAPD devoted solely to halting the obsessive harassment that has plagued celebrities from Madonna to Steven Spielberg , as well as hundreds of average citizens . " We are talking about people who take joy in reducing their victims to quivering masses , " says L.A. Deputy District Attorney Rhonda Saunders , 51 , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now helps run a groundbreaking task force out of the D.A . ' s office . " We need to intervene before a threat can become murder . " Photograph // There was no such law in place in 1989 , when obsessed fan Robert Bardo paid a private investigator $250 for the address of rising actress Rebecca Schaeffer , then gunned her down at the door of her L.A. apartment house . But since passage of the new statute , Saunders 's team has successfully prosecuted its share of celebrity stalkers , including Robert Hoskins , who scaled the security wall surrounding Madonna 's Hollywood Hills estate in 1995 , and Jonathan Norman , convicted in March after targeting Steven Spielberg and his family . " Now those who use fear as a weapon have something to fear themselves , " says U. S. Rep. Ed Royce ( R-Calif. ) , author of federal and state stalking laws , " an aggressive prosecutor with the tools to shut them down .

" People begin to think they have some kind of relationship with celebrities because they see them all the time . " One woman , Saunders recalls , had convinced herself that L.A. television weatherman Dallas Raines was sending her signals over the airwaves . " She believed he could see her , " Saunders says of Martha Cane , then 41 . Cane , herself a onetime Los Angeles police officer , became dangerous when she fixated on Raines 's wife , who she believed was standing in the way of her relationship . ( Convicted before the new antistalking statute , Cane spent less than six months in jail . ) But only about 10 percent of the hundred cases handled each year by Saunders 's unit-officially known as the Los Angeles County District Attorney 's Stalking and Threat Assessment Team-involve celebrities . Far more common are ordinary love affairs gone awry , such as the one between Steigerwald and a fellow student at Pierce College whom he dated for two weeks last November before she broke off the relationship . Since then , despite a restraining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus and 100 feet off campus , police say Steigerwald shadowed her relentlessly , pacing outside her house at dawn , leaving flowers and notes on her car , and dropping by her workplace unannounced . ' " He believes they still have a relationship , " says Det . Alex Vargas of the special LAPD squad , known as the Threat Management Unit , that works with Saunders 's team . Steigerwald pleaded no contest to stalking on Aug. 20 and was sentenced to 27 days in jail , five years ' probation and mandatory psychological counseling during the entire period . Photograph Officers Diane McNair and Alex Vargas interview suspect , later referred for therapy . NYPD Blue 's Andrea Thompson with exboyfriend Gianluigi Assennato this year . LAPD team members take a suspected stalker into custody on September 23. // Such outcomes bring immense satisfaction to Saunders , a former music theater performer and mother of two , who has worked for the Los Angeles D.A . ' s office since 1986 . She was prosecuting felonies in night court in 1991 when she got her first stalking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly alerted police that she was being harassed by another woman , including frequent phone calls at all hours and embarrassing letters to her friends . But the police could offer little help since she had not been physically attacked . When the victim hired a company to install a security system , workers discovered that the stalker had been living in the crawlspace under the victim 's house . " I had riever seen such human damage , " says Saunders of her interview with the victim . " She was having nightmares . She had to leave her home of 15 years . She looked haunted . " Though Saunders was able to convict Susan Dyer of assault with a deadly weapon in that case , the law then on the books made it virtually impossible to even file a stalking charge . ( The assault charge stemmed from an incident in which Dyer pointed a loaded gun at a friend of the victim 's and then held off a SWAT team for 11 hours . ) " Now we could have gotten three years for stalking in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " We could have gotten a 10-year restraining order including mandatory mental counseling . " That experience spurred Saunders to lobby California legislators until they enacted a new statute in January 1994 that redefined stalking to include threats " implied by a pattern of conduct " and mandated that victims be notified 15 days prior to a stalker 's release from prison . Then , last year , Saunders and her partner Deputy D.A . Scott Gordon were authorized by District Attorney Gil Garcetti to start their unit , which is largely aimed at preventing stalking from turning violent , as it does roughly 15 percent of the time . Since some half of all stalkers have had previous run-ins with the law , says Gordon , 42 , " if we can recognize those cases earlier , we might be able to prevent bigger problems . " In the case of celebrities , it 's sometimes hard to tell where fanhood ends and obsession begins . " If a fan writes a letter , that 's fine , " says Saunders . " But when that fan decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their home , we are getting a bit closer to stalking . " On rare occasions , the celebrity has actually had a relationship with the stalker Actress Andrea Thompson , who plays Det . Jill Kirkendall on NYPD Blue , was briefly involved romantically with Gianluigi Assennato , who designed the ensemble she wore to the 1997 Emmys . When Thompson broke off the relationship in April , he would n't let go and began secretly living out of her garage , says John Nazarian , the private detective she subsequently hired . In July the Italian-born designer was arrested for stalking , slashing Thompson 's tires and making threats against her and her 6-year-old son . ( In this case , which Gordon is prosecuting , Assennato is currently in L.A. County Jail in lieu of $1 million bail pending a pretrial hearing scheduled for Oct. 21 . ) " The fact that my client is being portrayed in the media as a psycho stranger is untrue , " says Assennato 's lawyer Jeffery Rubenstein . " This is a breakup situation . " Nazarian , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says of his client . " It got to the point where she did n't want to leave her house . " For many stalking victims , such fears never abate . " Whether it was Madonna , Spielberg or my Jane Doe cases , they are scared to death , " notes Saunders , who says victims consistently report nightmares about the stalker catching them . " None of them will ever feel safe again . " For instance , Spielberg-whose stalker had shown up at his home with handcuffs , a knife and duct tape , intending to sexually assault the director-fortified his house with extra lights and cameras and now travels with more security personnel .

Once he smashed her windshield . Another time he drove his truck through her front door . Treating these incidents as an ongoing domestic dispute , the police did nothing beyond filing reports . But after Bill threw a hammer through her window , narrowly missing their daughter 's head , one officer suggested to Robin that this amounted to stalking , and he sent the case file to Saunders 's attention . Saunders got a restraining order against Bill . " Rhonda said , It 's going to be okay . I 'm going to take care of this , " ' says Robin . " And she did . " Sent to prison once for stalking , Bill violated his parole in 1996 .

" Indeed , experts say that stalking usually stems from mental illness that often can not be cured .

" Certainly fighting stalkers can seem an endless task . For Saunders , her job means frequent nights with minimal sleep and long stretches away from her children . Still , the kids seem to appreciate her work . " When my daughter was 8 she said , Mommy , you 're a hero . You put the bad people away so they ca n't hurt anyone anymore , " ' says Saunders , smiling at the memory . " That 's what it 's all about .
