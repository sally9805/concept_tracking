<p> LET 'S DO AWAY WITH THE DEATH PENALTY <p> Editor  --  The Black Congressional Caucus got it right in not supporting the crime bill because , they claim , the death sentence will be imposed more often with its passage . <p> Personally , I 'm all in favor of the death penalty for heinous crimes , but the pathetic statistical fact is that only an insignificant number of murderers ever see the gas chamber . Many years and untold taxpayers ' dollars are spent by the convicted trying to thwart the judicial process and , pathetically for the relatives of the victims , the criminals consistently overturn the jury 's verdict and make a parody of our judicial system . <p> I say , to assuage the grief of the victim 's kin , to free the overburdened courts ' time and to conserve the taxpayers ' hard-earned money , that we just do away with the death penalty . It is just not cost-effective , not in dollars and not in legal equity . Simplify it all by dishing out a life sentence without parole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mill Valley <p> . <p> MYSTIFIED <p> EDITor  --  It mystifies me that any member of our Congress , Democrat or Republican , could seriously support the exclusion of an assault weapons ban from the crime bill . Surely there are opportunities for compromise within the bill , but how could anyone even suggest that assault weapons are not very much a part of the crime problem in this nation ? I find such political posturing to be shameful and so very self-serving . Responsible leadership it is not . <p> JANE C. DUDLEY <p> Belvedere <p> . <p> NO ON THE CRIME BILL <p> Editor  --  Let 's talk crime bill . The crime bill provides money to build basketball courts in the inner cities of this country . Why does n't the crime bill provide inner-city residents the opportunity for education and employment ? What do basketball courts provide that education and employment opportunities do not ? <p> Furthermore , an amendment to HR 4296 ( the assault-firearms ban that was incorporated into the crime bill ) that would have made a crime a felony if a firearm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the congressmembers who voted for HR 4296 . <p> Thus , the Congress has no intentions of taking a bite out of crime , but only wishes to ban firearms . <p> With these two inconsistencies alone , the crime bill should be voted no on by our respective representatives  --  not to mention the $ 33 billion unfunded spending ! <p> JOHN P. CONLEY <p> Petaluma <p> . <p> REVENGE IN NOVEMBER ? <p> Editor  --  To the congressional Republicans , I offer my heartiest congratulations . You 've just turned a slumbering president into an angry , crusading populist , fighting against the Washington establishment . I can only say , woe to you status quo supporters in November ! <p> DANIEL GOLDSTEIN <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> CHICKEN STUFFING <p> Editor  --  Concerning the article " Justice Dept . Seeks Investigation of Clinton Official , " Mr. Espy is quoted as saying that he expects to be cleared because he reimbursed Tyson Poultry for all costs . It is quite clear that Mr. Espy took gifts from Tyson Poultry while he was the secretary of agriculture under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in violation of the Meat Inspection Act of 1907 , which is supposed to prohibit anyone who regulates meat from accepting anything of value from those that they regulate . Mr. Espy violated that act by accepting the gifts . <p> When Mr. Espy got caught , he reimbursed Tyson Poultry and proclaimed his innocence . If I rob a bank , then get caught , can I give the money back and claim my innocence because I returned the money ? Sorry , Mr. Espy , you got caught , but I am certain that through the boondoggle leadership of the Clinton clan you will probably be vindicated . <p> KEN HUNTER <p> Willits ( Mendocino County ) <p> . <p> POPULATION ' FALLOUT ' <p> Editor  --  After reading The Chronicle 's special report on the " New Era in Human Migration " ( August 9 ) and viewing your full- color map tracing the paths of global flight from war , famine , economic and environmental collapse , I was reminded of a comment by Stanford biologist and author Paul Ehrlich . <p> When someone asked him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bomb , " Ehrlich replied : " It has already exploded . What we are looking at now is the fallout patterns . " <p> GAR SMITH <p> Earth Island Institute <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> PETE THE CRIME FIGHTER <p> Editor  --  Pete Wilson is only trying to undo what the Brown family did to California law enforcement when he supports a bill to raise the punishment for a sex crime to life in prison . We had such punishments once  --  life in prison for child molesting and 50 years for rape  --  until another politician from the Brown family reduced those punishments to a maximum of five years . Like Kathleen Brown , that politician was long on promises and short on a crime-fighting record when he ran for governor . Let us not repeat our mistake of 20 years ago . <p> RICHARD E. HOLMES <p> Senior Deputy District Attorney <p> Ventura ( Ventura County ) <p> . <p> ' MILLIONAIRES ' <p> Editor  --  Recently your paper and those writing letters to the editor have referred to " millionaire oilman " Michael Huffington , and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the interest of fairness , I suggest that you remind your readers that Dianne Feinstein is one of the very wealthiest members of the U.S. Senate , and that most of her wealth comes from inheritance and marriage . Ms. Feinstein from now on should be referred to as " millionaire politician " Dianne Feinstein . <p> ROBERT S. POWELL <p> Lafayette <p> . <p> ' SELENIUM DIET ' <p> Editor  --  The concern expressed by Cathy O'Brien ( Chronicle , August 6 ) for the animals UC Davis veterinarian Ben Norman proposes to graze on the Kesterson Reservoir site is understandable , but misplaced . Selenium is indeed toxic at high levels , but more significantly , it is also essential for many animals , including cattle and humans  --  that is , it is absolutely required in their diets . Cattle in the San Joaquin Valley are frequently deficient in this element and have been shown to benefit from a lump of selenium placed in the stomach ( rumen ) . Dr. Norman 's proposal to give cattle a diet enriched with Kesterson selenium may be a simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have the additional value of slowly dissipating the Kesterson selenium accumulation . <p> It is to be hoped , not feared , that the cattle do indeed pass the selenium on to consumers . At a reasonable level of intake , California 's 30-plus million humans need to consume about a ton of selenium per year . <p> LARRY WALDRON <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> NATIVE 'S LAMENT <p> Editor  --  Being a native , when I made the decision to leave my beloved San Francisco for a safe and tranquil locale , the move was fraught with misgivings . <p> Over the last few years as the city 's relentless deterioration affecting quality of life aspects becomes more evident , i.e. , Muni crimes , etc. , I made the right decision . <p> Remembering the city of my youth and just how lovely she was , remains with me . <p> MILLIE PLUMMER <p> La Selva Beach ( Santa Cruz County ) <p> . <p> HOPEFULLY <p> EDITor  --  Mr. Fange should not be so hidebound concerning the word hopefully ( Letters , August 4 ) . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it is to be hoped . " American Heritage Dictionary explains this usage as follows : " The use of hopefully to mean ' it is to be hoped , ' . . . is grammatically justified by analogy to the similar uses of happily and mercifully . However , this usage is by now such a bugbear to traditionalists that it is best avoided on grounds of civility , if not logic . " <p> Hopefully , Mr. Fange himself could be more civil in the future concerning hopefully . <p> TELK <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> ' RULE OF THUMB III ' <p> Editor  --  I 'd always heard the " rule of thumb " was applied to distinguish spouse abuse from the beneficial disciplining of wives . In colonial times , certain religious sects condoned wife beating , but to prevent injury , the switch used must be no thicker than the husband 's thumb . <p> I never liked this story  --  I think it came out of the feminist movement  --  and I 'm happy to learn that it might be apocryphal . <p> @ @ @ @ @
