Fairchild hall looked like a castle , but Miranda Perletier thought the cool echoes and damp stone odor suggested a water-monster 's cave . It was September 1968 , Buckeye State University , and Miranda was hurrying to teach her very first class . <p> She twisted the key and streaked her office door open . On the cracked linoleum lay a big envelope . She slid her granny glasses up the bridge of her nose , sleeked her long hair back , and ripped it open . Inside was a drawing in black , black ink : a gravestone , lettered PROFESSOR PERLETIER , R.I.P . 1968 . <p> Chilled , she turned the drawing over . On the back was : SORRY YOU GAVE ME THAT F ! It was signed KANE . <p> An F ? Never ! Failing a student was too cruel . She had never even taught a class all her own before . The note must be for a former occupant . She grabbed her gradebook and dashed upstairs . <p> She had wanted to be a professor since age twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floors at a teacher 's college in Iowa , had given his children literary names : Miranda , Dulcinea , Caedmon . From him she got her love of stories , her dreams of inspiring students with the magic of literature . <p> A crowd waited on the landing . Girls in miniskirts with teased hair and black eye makeup , girls with long , wild hair and daisies painted on their cheeks . Guys bearded , with shaggy manes and bell-bottom jeans belted so low you could see tendrils of pubic hair . A few ROTC types , too , with button-down collars and naked , vulnerable skulls . Her freshmen . Her very first students . Their faces were so trusting . Their minds would be like sponges for her lessons of beauty . She wanted to hug them all . <p> " Door 's locked , " said a girl in elephant bell-bottoms . <p> A wiry old lady in tweed raced up the worn stairs : Dr. Fable . " Not locked . It 's those blasted Lilliputians . They did this last year , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blake 's Prophetic Books . Students scrambled out of her way . To Miranda she said , " Get back in line , child . " <p> Miranda wanted to pull her miniskirt down to make it longer . " But Dr. Fable , I 'm their teacher . " <p> " Oh . " Fable took another look , as if she had missed the brand that said ROOKIE TEACHING ASSISTANT on Miranda 's forehead . " Well , get out of the way while I open this damn fool door . " Fable kicked the lower hinge and , with a powerful twist , wrenched the door open . " You ca n't turn your back on it ; things get out . " She curtsied ironically , and bounded back downstairs , leaving Miranda to wonder what things got out of what . <p> " My roommate said Fairchild Hall has ghosts , " said a dainty girl with a big nose and fluffy blonde hair . <p> Room 203 smelled like paper and erasers . Ancient wooden desks sat in rows , covered with the patina of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gouged in their surfaces . The room was neat , empty , waiting . <p> The mural was waiting too . <p> The colors were deep , the lines sweeping the effect garish . Some art student had done it , years ago . September morning light from the bank of windows made it glow like stained glass . <p> Ebenezer Scrooge and Titania , Queen of Fairies , melodramatically shared . a spotlight , inches from where the Wife of Bath flirted with a degenerate from Confessions of an English Opium Eater . Julius Caesar , Brutus 's dagger protruding jauntily from his toga , slumped at the feet of King Arthur . Milton 's Satan glared at Othello . Gulliver lay tethered by his own hair while Caliban and David Copperfield gaped at him . <p> But Miranda had eyes only for the monster . Grendel . The slathering Beowulf beast , lurid green with black saliva dripping from his teeth . Hunchbacked . Eyes red with fury . Claw-like arms ( the artist perhaps influenced by the tyrannosaurus rex in Fantasia ) , menacing an Anglo-Saxon warrior . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon on his shield . <p> Miranda quavered , " Students ! This is section 101b , and I am Miss Perletier . Here is a syllabus  --  " Herhands trembled as she handed out dittoed sheets . Students sniffed the still-wet duplicating fluid . "  --  and a writing assignment for our first day . " <p> Miranda dropped the assignment sheets . A boy with a peace-sign necklace and tie-dyed gauze shirt helped her pick them up . <p> " Uh , on second thought , it might be dull to write about THE VALUE OF A LIBERAL ARTS EDUCATION TO SOCIETY . " <p> " Let 's write about the wall painting , " said a boy with a bushy beard and angelic blue eyes . <p> Miranda blinked . " Good idea ! Everybody write about Grendel . " <p> Silence . " Who 's Grendel ? " asked Bushy Beard . <p> Miranda adored explaining things . She told them the story of Beowulf , acting out the parts .. The class period was half over when she realized that it was too late for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then went over to introduce herself properly to Grendel . <p> " Hello , you ' blaed-fastne feond . " ' Nobody was watching , so she closed her eyes and kissed Grendel . <p> And  --  Miranda had always been imaginative  --  felt her lips press a leathery cheek , smelling of sea-water . <p> At the threshold of hearing , fairies tittered . But when she opened her eyes , Titania , Grendel , and the whole mural looked as innocent and flat as when she had first seen them . <p> Dr. Fable stopped Miranda on the way out of the building . " You 've discovered our Grendel , " she said . " Perhaps you 'll discover yourself in the mural , too . " <p> In her apartment , after her freshmen wrote in class , Miranda was amazed that it took her an hour to grade just one essay . <p> " Be cool , " said Vivianne , her roommate , " and disappear tomorrow . Luigi is crashing here on his way to Oberlin , and we 'd dig some privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Bummer . That 's what they build libraries for . " <p> Miranda went into the bedroom and brushed her hair , furiously . She did n't want to grade papers in the library . <p> Vivianne followed her , toying with her love-beads . " I 'll do the dishes for a month . Dig it . A whole month . " <p> Miranda pulled yard-long loose hairs out of the brush . " You must really like Luigi . " <p> Vivianne blew a kiss toward the ceiling . " The man is right on . What can I say ? " <p> Miranda sighed . " Okay , I 'll grade in my office . " <p> Saturday morning in Indian-summer heat , Miranda climbed the stone steps to the doors of Fairchild Hall . The lock was stiff ; the door creaked open like the portal to the mead hall where Beowulf greeted Hrothgar . <p> She was tempted to go look at the Grendel mural again . But if it took her an hour to do just one paper , a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So she skipped down the creaky stairs to her office and settled at the old oak desk , glad that her two office mates were elsewhere . <p> " The Angel-Sexton period of literature is very interesting " began the first paper . Miranda fought an impulse to write BORING , BORING in the margin . Her red pen took on a life of its own , bleeding corrections and advice : TRY FOR MORE VIVID LANGUAGE or I CA N'T FOLLOW YOUR LOGIC . <p> This was the first set of freshmen papers Miranda had ever graded , so she did not really find them boring . When she looked up , it was almost lunch time . She swung around in the oak office chair . <p> A man stood in the office doorway , watching . <p> How long had he been there ? He wore a polyester suit too small for his big frame and a frayed green tie . His eyes were angry , his face unhealthily pale and sweaty . <p> She swallowed . " Are you looking for someone ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The title sounded odd , but she tried to look professorial . <p> " Did you get my note ? " <p> Miranda felt annoyed . " What note ? " <p> The man bent down and fished something out of her wastebasket . " This . " He thrust it at her . The sketch of a gravestone . <p> " Who are you , and why are you snooping through my wastebasket ? " <p> He lowered his ; head as if his words had some deep meaning . " Kane 's the name . " <p> Miranda 's stomach flipflopped . Should she call for help ? He seemed harmless . He had made a mistake , that was all . <p> " Mr. Kane , I saw that note , yes , but I just started teaching this semester . I do n't know how you even know my name , except that it 's on my door . I certainly did n't give you an F. " <p> Kane laughed . " I have the paper here . A fine paper , publishable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed it . Because it reminded you of your own mediocrity . " <p> " What are you talking about ? I never taught you . " Miranda stood and put the chair between Kane and her . <p> " You 're stupid . " Kane 's voice was low , menacing . <p> " Let me see the paper . " Miranda 's heart hammered in her chest . <p> Kane handed her a tattered paper titled " GRENDEL AND HIS MOTHER : FREUDIAN IMPLICATIONS AND UNSPEAKABLE EVIL . " Odd that the topic was like one she had assigned , but she certainly had not graded this paper . She skimmed : in flowery , hysterical language , it accused Grendel of every crime from incest to heroin peddling . A humor piece ? No hint of playfulness . The grader 's comments , on the last page , suggested that Kane get psychiatric help . Then , a big , red F. <p> " Look , " began Miranda , " here are some papers I 've graded . You can see this is n't my penmanship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miranda backed away . " It 's your work , bitch , and you 're going to pay for it . " Kane pulled from his pocket a pair of purple nylon tights . He held a length of one leg taut between his fists . <p> Miranda edged away . Could she rash by him into the hallway ? <p> A gruff voice bellowed , " Kane , we 've warned you about haunting this building . Maybe the police can explain to you about trespassing . " <p> Kane spun around . It was Dr. Fable . Fable grabbed Kane 's wrist . " You need another stay at Mercy Pavilion ? " <p> Kane tried to pull away , but Dr. Fable twisted his arm behind him . " Give me this toy . " She snatched the purple tights . " God , to what base uses we may come . " She turned to Miranda . " ' You 're the new graduate student I met Wednesday . " <p> Miranda nodded , silent . <p> " This fellow fancies some woman professor responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Freud 's minions ca n't eradicate . But he 's afraid of me . Are n't you , humbug ? " <p> Kane looked ashamed to be cowed by someone smaller than he . <p> " He must have stolen a building key . Upstairs , Wormbrain . " <p> Two young policemen met them at the top of the stair . Like most of her generation , Miranda had mixed feelings about police . But since she had never been arrested , never been in a sit-in , never been gassed , these policemen did not seem like pigs . They seemed like nice men who would remove Kane . <p> Miranda went back to her office , though her mind was not on her grading . Dr. Fable came back to check on her twice . Both times she nearly shrieked with fright . <p> " You 've nothing to fear from the likes of Kane , " said Fable . " You have hidden resources . " She tapped her own temple and winked . <p> The incident faded from memory . Grendel , her beautiful monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Beowulf was not in the textbook . But Miranda typed a translation on spirit masters and got the secretary to run off copies . The typing was a labor of love . " Ooo , they 'll love the part about wrenching off his arm , " she thought , and , " What a lovely speech when the kingless thane steals the dragon 's cup ! " <p> To her annoyance , her students vilified Grendel . She felt Grendel had tragic potential : the only character in the epic who had no leader , in a world where masterless men were outcasts . Grendel was a son of darkness , yes . But when revenge was heaped upon revenge , murder on murder , darkness and light were arbitrary . <p> She was wrong about the epic , her advisor told her . Imposing modern ethical concepts . Anachronism . <p> Dr. Fable thought otherwise . " You 're using your gifts , " she said . And the monster in the painting seemed to smile toothily . <p> One Saturday morning , Miranda arranged to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his paper . <p> She had known immediately that the paper was copied . Her heart sank as she read critic . al terms far too advanced for any freshman . " David , David , " she keened to herself . " Is this my fault ? I 've been too demanding and you 've felt you had to cheat ! " The source was easy to find . David knew enough to copy from the best : " The Monsters and the Critics , " by J.R.R. Tolkien . <p> Finally , Miranda decided David was n't going to show . " Coward , " she muttered as she tugged her jacket on . <p> Miranda 's concern went only skin deep , because she had a date for lunch at the Art Museum . <p> His name was Dharma Stefaniski , though baptized Kenneth . She was charmed by his handsome red beard and chestnut hair , as well as the tattoo of a rainbow on his left arm . He had a shy lopsided smile , and an enormous record collection : Jefferson Airplane , Ravi Shankar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs from the basement of Fairchild Hall , anticipating buttered artichokes among the sculptures and the fountains , then a stroll hand-in-hand from Rodin 's massive " The Thinker " to the voluptuous " Cupid and Psyche . " They would giggle over Cupid 's satiated smile , then spend the evening ; listening to Dharma 's records . <p> Blocking the door , daylight and cold air streaming into Fairchild Hall from behind him , stood a dark figure . <p> Kane . <p> " They gave me drugs . " Kane let the door creak closed . " But I did n't forget . " <p> Miranda edged back , planning exit routes . " Forget what ? " <p> " The F on that paper . " <p> " Oh , come on ! " Miranda exploded . " You know very well I did n't give you an F on that paper . You got it years ago from some teacher that went on to teach somewhere else . " <p> " No . You gave it to me . " Kane ran his finger over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought . <p> No , not a sword . The blade , heavy and sharp as a guillotine blade , from the paper-cutter in the English office . <p> Miranda was scared , but also furious . Dr. Fable said Kane was harmless . The mental hospital had released him . But here he was , with a heavy , sharp weapon . Not only was he threatening her life , he was making her late to meet Dharma ! <p> " I showed you , that is n't even my handwriting ! " <p> Kane looked uncertain . <p> " Try to remember the professor 's face . Was she young , like me ? Did she have long hair , like me ? " <p> He swung the cutter blade , then let it dangle heavily . " I know her name was Perletier . " <p> " What was her first name ? " <p> Kane 's brow knit and he peered at her darkly . " Shirley ? " <p> " My name is Miranda ! You changed her last name to match mine . But you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see ? It was the LSD ! " <p> Kane 's mouth puckered . He bunched his shoulders and cradled the cutter blade . <p> Miranda softened her voice . " Bad acid , Kane . That 's all . Let me see the paper . " <p> Kane propped the cutter blade against the door frame and produced the crumpled paper . <p> " This is n't a bad paper at all . " Humor him . " lust needs more focus . " <p> " I flunked out of Buckeye because of that paper . " Kane wiped his nose on the sleeve of his jacket . <p> " Why , I 'd give this paper a C plus . Or maybe a B , even . " <p> New hostility flamed in his eyes . <p> " A B ? " he growled . " This is publishable . This is Nobel Laureate work . When you fools are dead and buried , I 'll be Professor Emeritus . My genius will blazon forth . " He lowered his voice , half menace , half confiding . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my letters , so I called him and he said come right over . I flew . He admitted right away that he 'd been following the plot . " <p> " The president of the university ? " Miranda choked . <p> Kane 's eyes grew round . " No . The President of the United States . " <p> " Oh , " Miranda whispered . " Uh , why do n't you wait here ? I think I remember this Shirley person . I 'll call her and  --  " <p> Kane grabbed her arm with a paralyzing grip . " I wo n't hurt you . Just excise the source of the problem . " He groped for the cutter blade . " You 're right-handed , are n't you ? " <p> Miranda forced herself to relax in his grip , push toward him , then jerk away . He was blocking the main doors , so she ran to the stairs . Dr. Fable 's office was on the third floor . Fable came in on Saturdays ! <p> Miranda scurried up the stairs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dr. Fable 's office was dark , empty . <p> She pushed through the double doors to the department library , an echoing gabled room like a medieval chapel . Stairs led upward to a high window . She dashed up them . <p> Through the wire-meshed glass in the doors , she could see a fire escape . But how did the doors unlock ? <p> Kane bellowed from the second story landing " Perletier ! Perletier ! " <p> Miranda leapt back down the stairs , glad she 'd worn sneakers . She burst through the double doors again , thinking when he got to the third floor she would push him off balance down the stairs . <p> He was n't there . He was waiting on the second floor landing chest heaving . " Goddam hippie ! " he snarled . <p> " Hippie ! " Miranda was outraged . She was not a hippie . Hippies did not have jobs . Hippies took drugs every day . Hippies did not wear miniskirts and teach freshman comp . " Hippie ! I 'm not the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kane lurched up the stairs toward her . <p> There were two offices besides Fable 's . One belonged to Dr. Langland , the medievalist , and the other  --  <p> She pounded on Langland 's office , but knew before she tried that the ancient prof was not in . No light shone under the door , and Langland was so nearly blind he used the light even at noon . <p> Miranda pounded on the other door with the flats of her hands . <p> Then she noticed there was no nameplate on the door . <p> Empty ! <p> She wrenched the knob . Yes ! And unlocked . She darted inside and tripped the lock just as Kane got to the third floor . <p> A telephone ? No , the office was empty except for dusty cardboard boxes of old student themes . <p> " Pedantic bitch ! " howled Kane . <p> Miranda leaned against the door , jarred by Kane 's blows on it . Would it hold ? <p> " An F ! A goddam F ! " She heard him stumble downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Or was he trying to trick her into coming out ? <p> The window ! <p> Painted shut . <p> Could she break the window ? Then she noticed the fire escape . Oh , no ! Kane was planning to climb out a second story window , crawl up the fire escape , and break into the office she was in . <p> She started to cry . Her bloodied body would be found Monday or Tuesday  --  or even later , because who would look in this deserted room ? <p> And not only that , , she was late for her date . Dharma would think she was standing him up ! <p> She laughed , through tears . Kane was going to chop her hand off , and she was worried about missing lunch ! <p> Maybe Kane would n't think of the fire escape . But where could he have gone ? She peeked down the fire escape . Nothing . <p> Kane 's footsteps up the stairs again . Damn it ! <p> Blows against the door again , more determined now . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blade ! <p> Miranda flew to the window , hammered on it with naked fists , kicked it . She took off her sneaker and pounded it . The frame clattered . The glass would n't break ! <p> She looked around , panic knocking at her rib cage . Nothing ! No phone , no tools , no weapons , only  --  <p> Box . <p> She grunted with the weight of the cardboard box . Then one , two , HEAVED it through the window . The glass shattered , explosively . <p> She leaned , out , ignoring glass shards . " I 'm being murdered ! " Two girls below looked up , consulted , then strolled away . <p> Miranda hoped they flunked out . <p> But now she could get to the fire escape . <p> She pulled out the biggest glass fragments and straddled the window frame . <p> But the fire escape did n't reach to this window , only as far as Dr. Langland 's . And her legs were too short to reach . <p> At least Kane would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't matter . He had chopped a hole in the door , and now inserted his hand and fumbled for the lock . <p> Miranda beat at his hand with her sneaker . <p> He wrenched the sneaker from her . <p> She backed against the window . She would have to jump . A broken leg was better than being hacked to death . <p> " HELP ME ! " she yelled . <p> She threw all the power of her being into that yell . <p> A briny smell wafted to her , and Miranda flashed on a memory : she was on a rocky shore , imagining huge creatures that lived in the deep water . The power of that watery memory spurted into her like a geyser . She must not , would not let Kane kill her . <p> And then she heard it : someone lumbering up the stairs . Someone bigger than Dr. Fable or Dr. Langland . Bigger even than Kane . <p> Kane had the lock undone . But the door did not swing open . Instead , he yelled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " NO ! " <p> Scuffling . Intake of powerful breath . Choking gurgling . The dank smell , rank and animal . <p> Crunching like a wooden chair being twisted apart . And a sodden thud , like a melon thrown against the wall . <p> Miranda trembled , the force of her fear ebbing from her . <p> Nothing . <p> " Who 's there ? " she whispered . The briny smell faded . <p> Heavy , ursine footsteps downstairs again . Floor boards on the landing creaked . Shuffling , massive weight lumbered down the hall . <p> Again , nothing . <p> Miranda felt limp . What was outside that door ? The police ? Dr. Fable ? Would n't they have spoken to her ? <p> She crept up to the door , pressed her face to the hole Kane had hacked with his cutter blade . <p> The cutter blade lay on the floor . A dark rivulet ran toward it , pooled in the hollow worn by the feet of generations of students . Blood ? Whose blood ? <p> Nerves singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peeked out . <p> Kane lay silent , gazing upward . Above him , gray paneling was smeared with red , as if someone had thrown a painted basketball at the wall . Kane 's neck bent strangely , as if he were trying to tuck it under his arm . <p> " Kane , " she spoke softly . <p> No answer . She watched his chest . It did not move . <p> " Poor Kane . " She retrieved her sneaker . <p> He lay still as she tiptoed past him down the stairs . <p> The police insisted that she must have used martial arts training or that Kane must have broken his own skull , spine , and neck in the straggle . <p> Dharma picked her up from the police station in his VW Bug . " Oh , wow , " he said , his face alive with a mixture of concern and relief . " You 're all spattered with blood ! " <p> The next Monday , while her students wrote , she graded papers . Her head ached as if from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mural . <p> A tap on the door . <p> Dr. Fable , smiling mischievously , beckoned . " So what happened ? " <p> Miranda told the whole story . " This sounds foolish , " she said , " but I think Grendel saved me . " <p> Fable tsked . " You saved yourself . But if you ever notice a girl that seems to have a certain imaginative glow  --  like you  --  pass on this secret . The mural is a talisman from which you can summon what you want . You had the energy , and a strong soul . " <p> Miranda smiled foolishly . " Me ? My soul is n't very strong . " <p> " The proof 's in what happened . Grendel 's only a story . But he lives inside you . " <p> " A monster inside me ? " <p> Fable snorted . " A dozen monsters , and a dozen heroines . The mural brings out the gift . " Fable glanced inside the classroom , at students who were putting papers on the desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Miranda giggled , and for a moment felt her power . <p> Fable whispered , " I suggest Titania . " <p> ILLUSTRATION : " I think the thing that surprised me the most about heaven was how many lawyers there were . " <p> <p> By Mary A. <p> Mary A. Turzillo last appeared in F &SF; in our March 1993 issue . She has had stories in The Ultimate Witch , SF Age , Interzone , and Pulphouse : A Hardback Magazine . Her poetry has appeared in Asimov 's . She writes , " ' Miranda 's Monster ' was inspired by a mural in a classroom where I took freshman comp . The rest of the story has nothing to do with reality .
