So you want a piece of me ? Think you 're such a hotshot e-trader that you should quit your day job to pit your wits against me and my fellow professionals , who swing around millions of dollars in stock a day without blinking ? At one time , I would have laughed if you had even contemplated such a thing . You could n't match my access to conference calls , information or quick brokers . You could n't afford the $1,500 a month you 'd need for a Reuters , Dow Jones or Bloomberg wire . <P> But these days there is so much great information available via the Internet that I no longer have much of an edge . And on-line trading execution , while suffering from occasional outages , equals anything I can muster with all my direct wires and trading turrets . <P> The truth is there has never been a better time to attempt to trade for a living . The opportunities for short-term profits in the stock market , given the new wild swings we have seen , ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been true for most of this 17-year bull market , when only wacky , thin , corrupt or heavily shorted stocks jumped enough to make a short-term triumph possible . And for most of that period , commissions were so high that they ate into those gains for all but the biggest traders , who got discounts from their brokerage firms . <P> Neither is true now , though . In the past few weeks , deft traders have been able to make 15 points on IBM in one day or make 6 on 3M or Alcoa , Eastman Kodak or Hewlett-Packard . These are marquee Dow names , not heavily manipulated penny stocks or hyped Net offerings . You could " scalp " a huge gain simply by buying these stocks at the opening and selling them at the bell . <P> Sure , the tax code favors those who hold ' em . And America has made a hero of Warren Buffett , in part because he had a predilection to own , not trade , during a phenomenal period to be long stocks . But where is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owning for a few minutes makes you a fool ? <P> So why not do it ? Why not try to be like that guy in the ad  --  you know , Al , who owns his own country but drives a tow truck because he likes helping people ? <P> O.K. , I 'll give you a reason . Because it 's hard  --  really hard  --  to get the direction right , even with all that great info and terrific execution . We have enjoyed the bull market of a lifetime , one that has seen the Dow go up more than 8,000 points , and yet every day thousands of issues go down or disappear or blow up . And while you hear periodically of the day trader who earns enough to retire , you do n't hear about them any more than you do about lottery winners . <P> To me , there is a happy medium here . You can use the more level playing field to great advantage . You see a product you like , a store you enjoy , a way-cool website  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spare time than ever before . You can get e-mail alerts about it . You can chat about it with others . You can get comfortable with the fundamentals as never before . And if it goes down , you can buy more rather than kick it out in a panic . If your tax situation permits , you can take a quick gain without having it eaten up by commissions .
