<p> James Green and his younger brother , Eric , are having lunch in the courtyard of a restaurant in Pleasanton . It is a sunny August day , and shadows from overhanging trees dapple the patio . Over a chicken sandwich , Eric , 45 , reminisces about their Oakland childhood . <p> " Jamie was just the same all the way from day one , " says Eric . " We used to play tackle football in the front yard . And he built a tree house in the redwood tree , and we used to play army with the kids next door , getting in the dirt and all that stuff . " <p> " Yeah , I was always the general ! " says James . <p> " So , " continues Eric , " Jamie 's always been , um . . . Jamie 's been , you know . . . " <p> James prompts him . " This way . " <p> " This way . The same as he is now , except . . . no fuzz . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> James  --  a 48-year-old female-to- male transsexual  --  crinkles his face in delight and laughs loudly . So does his brother . <p> For decades , people have viewed those who changed their biological sex as freaks of nature , or as psychopaths or simply pathetic creatures who , for whatever reason , could not accept what nature had given them . In the 1950s , the word " transsexual " became synonymous , in the public mind , with media sensation Christine Jorgensen . <p> Like Jorgensen , most of the transsexuals who made their transitions public  --  including tennis player Renee Richards , British writer Jan Morris and countless guests on countless talk shows  --  changed their biological sex from male to female . <p> In recent years , however , new voices have emerged , as female-to- male transsexuals have sought  --  and fought  --  to generate awareness of their existence . While doctors formerly thought that these FTMs , as they call themselves , numbered far fewer than their male-to-female counterparts , many now believe that the true ratio is closer to even . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been among the leaders of the effort . And he wants people to understand one thing about masculinity : It has more to do with a man 's inner life than with his genitals . <p> " Being a man is not about how other people define it , but how you choose to define it for yourself , " he says . " If nontranssexual men could realize that being male is n't necessarily about having a penis , then they 'd be doing themselves and everybody else  --  including women  --  a service . " <p> That may sound surprising coming from someone who dreamed for years about altering his female genitalia . Yet it encapsulates the experience of a great many transsexuals , for whom sex and gender are most definitely not the same thing . <p> While many people use the terms interchangeably , transsexuals view " sex " as the biological category represented by the genitals . " Gender " is the psychological identity that nestles wherever a person 's most intimate sense of self resides  --  in the mind , or in the soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female body , his gender  --  his conception of his place in the world  --  was male . <p> Today , there is little about James ' physical presence to recall the woman whose body he used to have . Oh , perhaps a slight curve of the hips or bottom . . . but even that would be a telltale sign only to those who knew of his former life . <p> His voice is deep and rich as chocolate . His arms and upper torso are thick and muscular . His beard is full , and his hairline is receding . His booming laugh explodes across the room like a grenade . <p> A technical writer and aspiring novelist who received both a BA and MFA from the University of Oregon , James lives in a ground-floor apartment in a large bayside complex . Wobbly stacks of papers and files populate the alcove he has set aside as an office . Scattered about the living rooms are magazines ranging from the New Yorker and Men 's Fitness to Transgender Tapestry . <p> Settling into his couch in green sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans back and discusses his life . He and his brother were adopted as infants , and their parents raised them with love and acceptance . <p> " It was kind of a 1950s ' Leave It to Beaver ' childhood  --  except with this twist , " he says . Though his parents let him play the tomboy at home , they did require him , against his will , to wear a dress to church and school . <p> He was n't called James then , of course , but today he prefers not to disclose his former name , which he changed to the androgynous Jamison when he was 15 . Despite his female biology , people always perceived him as a little boy  --  which is precisely how he felt . <p> " When I saw Mary Martin in ' Peter Pan , ' I was 7 or 8 , " he says . " I thought , ' Well , they let her dress up and act like a boy . Is she a boy ? Does she become a boy ? ' Then I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Maybe I can grow up to be a boy , too . ' " <p> James ' mother recognized her daughter 's fascination  --  although not the root of it  --  and sewed a Peter Pan outfit , which the young girl wore constantly until she outgrew it . <p> Surgeon Gail Lebovic is sitting in her Palo Alto office , which has a broad view of the surrounding hills . Dr. Lebovic , who several years ago operated on James ' chest to remove scars left after his mastectomies , is friendly and down-to-earth as she recalls her first meeting with a transsexual in 1990 . <p> After training at George Washington University Medical School and Stanford University Medical Center , she obtained a fellowship to study with Dr. Donald Laub , a Palo Alto surgeon . On the first day of her fellowship , her senior colleague asked her to examine a patient who had arrived for surgery . <p> " This was a man who was about 55 years old , a little bit overweight , " she says . " So I started asking routine questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' ' Yes , ' he said , ' I 've had bilateral mastectomies and a hysterectomy . ' I mean , this was a man , who had a job in the school district . His wife was with him . I was really confused . " <p> Dr. Lebovic laughs at the memory . " And then I understood . But there was no question in my mind at all . I accepted him as a man . " <p> Today , Dr. Lebovic and Dr. Laub perform dozens of transsexual surgeries a year for transitioning men and women through the Gender Dysphoria Program in Palo Alto , which Dr. Laub started in the 1970s . It is one of a handful of top-quality centers in the United States where transsexuals can obtain psychological evaluation , hormonal treatments , help in adjusting to life as a member of the opposite sex , and , finally , surgery . <p> Dr. Lebovic estimates that at least 1,000 transsexuals undergo surgery in the United States every year . Under the law , any licensed practitioner can legally perform the procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done for the person now than on the cause of his or her condition , which no one can fully explain . Many doctors used to believe that it stemmed from some of the same factors they blamed for homosexuality  --  childhoods steeped in parental modeling of socially unacceptable or unconventional gender roles . More recent theories focus on hormonal or biological events in utero . <p> As she speaks about her patients , Dr. Lebovic 's sympathy for their dilemma and her desire to help them is palpable . She says that performing transsexual surgery  --  which makes up about 15 percent of her practice  --  is among the most rewarding work she does . <p> " The patients are so grateful , " she says . " They 're really committed , and you 're giving them something they 've always wanted . It 's just a good feeling . . . . These people have suffered so much . " <p> Dr. Lebovic swivels in her gray leather chair and pulls out four big folders . She flips through them . The first book contains primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet genital surgery . Many of them sport mustaches or beards . <p> " Just a regular bunch of guys , " she says . " You can see why they 'd want their bodies to match . " <p> The second book includes photos of chest reconstruction , and the remaining two show the results of the various genital surgeries . As Dr. Lebovic describes the options , her voice percolates with enthusiasm . <p> Most FTMs , she says , choose to have phalloplasty , which involves the construction of a penis using a roll of flesh from the abdomen . The organ itself has no sensation but covers the still-intact clitoris and can be used for intercourse with the aid of inserts or pumps . <p> It is also possible to remove a nerve from the arm and attach it through microsurgery to both the clitoris and the phallus . This expensive , painful series of procedures  --  " a sort of Rolls Royce phalloplasty , " says Dr. Lebovic  --  ensures that the penis itself has sensation . <p> Then there is the metoidioplasty option , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as two inches from testosterone  --  is released from the clitoral hood . Judging from photos , the organ looks rather like a Bonsai-penis  --  small , delicate and perfectly proportioned , although not ideal for intercourse . <p> The surgical options , which include the construction of a scrotum , can cost tens of thousands of dollars  --  which insurance rarely covers . <p> " Most men have the phalloplasty , because the penis does tend to be sort of symbolic of the male identity , " says Dr. Lebovic . " And also , in order for them to have what they would consider a normal sexual life , they want to be able to have intercourse . " <p> Do any of the patients make special requests about how large a penis they would like ? <p> Dr. Lebovic laughs . " Very few patients come in with demands . Some will say I want an inch-and-a-half around , but that 's rare . To be honest , for the surgeon , it 's really what you 're working with . You have to use the tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much artistic leeway , " she adds dryly . <p> Like many FTMs , James lived for a long time as a lesbian . He played a butch role , at one point becoming Pacific Northwest Bell 's first female cable splicer . But the fit never felt right . People often did not perceive him as female , and when he used public rest rooms , women sometimes screamed and called for the police . <p> " It was a constant struggle , " he says with a sigh . " I just got tired of the battle . I was sick of the cute , safe , androgynous routine . I could n't be a woman , so my only choice was to be a man . " <p> For years , though , he retained what he was born with out of feminist solidarity . " I felt to some extent I owed it to other women not to give up that position of being female , to continue to show that it was possible to do whatever you want and still have a female body , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a daughter in 1985 , he ached to be known as her father , not her other mother . When a son followed a few years later , James felt it was time to proceed . <p> " I got to the point where the split between my gender identity and my body was just too much for me , " he says . " If I stayed in my female body , I would be asking my kids to hold that dichotomy , too . With the kids , I had more responsibilities . That forced me to grow up . " <p> He applied to enter the Gender Dysphoria program and was accepted . At the time , he had just started working as a vice president at a large corporation . He told his new boss , who accepted the news but had difficulty referring to him as " he " for more than a year  --  a common situation confronted by those who transition while on the job . <p> James chose the metoidioplasty option , and was thrilled about the change . Even his widowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But his partner was less than enthused , and the relationship fell apart . James maintains a close relationship with his 12-year- old daughter , but his former partner has not allowed him to continue to see the younger child . <p> His daughter says he is a typical dad  --  mostly fun , sometimes a pain . He takes her to McDonald 's and the movies , and the two are building a large wooden dollhouse together . <p> She has not told most of the kids at school about his history , but some of the adults she encounters know the situation . And his visibility as a transsexual activist annoys her on occasion , like when James took her to the podiatrist to get her hangnail treated . <p> The podiatrist had recently read an interview with James . " She said to me , ' How does it feel to have a famous Dad ? ' " says James ' daughter , rolling her eyes . " And I 'm like , ' Can you work on my toe ? ' " <p> Given his experiences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and behavior is based solely on societal expectations and not on biology . <p> " If gender was socially constructed , I would have turned out to be a girl , " he says . " People told me all my life I was a girl , and I tried , I really tried . You think this was easy ? I could have saved a lot of money and a lot of heartache if I did n't have to do this . But it was the only way I could be who I was . " <p> Founded 11 years ago , FTM International is a San Francisco- based education and support group that has close to a thousand members across the country . A few dozen FTMs , along with their partners and supporters , meet once a month in San Francisco to gossip , listen to guest speakers and explore topics ranging from the spiritual aspects of changing one 's body to the insurance hassles many of them face . <p> Like James , who is president of the group , some of those who attend have fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are simply taking hormones . Some are gay men , but most are heterosexual . Many are just curious to learn more about the phenomenon , but most are interested in understanding where they  --  and their gender identity  --  fit in . <p> FTMs have a particular fondness for facial hair , since they recognize that it is one of society 's key signifiers of maleness . At one meeting , when several guys fuss over one man 's newly sprouting beard , he beams broadly . He explains that when he could no longer hide his transition from his father , he leavened his disclosure with humor . <p> " I told him , ' The good news is , I 'm not a lesbian , ' " he says . From the raucous laughter that follows , it is clear that many of the guys previously lived as lesbians , and that their parents frequently had difficulty accepting the situation . <p> Toward the end of another gathering , a handful of men strip off their shirts and flex their muscles proudly . Others inch forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scars remaining from the surgeries , the chests are remarkably buff . It would take a seasoned observer , in many cases , to distinguish them from originals . <p> At last weekend 's meeting , Larry Brinkin , who handles discrimination complaints for the San Francisco Human Rights Commission , discussed what legislation there is to protect transsexuals . <p> While federal and state laws generally do not specifically protect transsexuals , he told the group , San Francisco passed an ordinance in 1994 that bans discrimination based on gender identity . Several other jurisdictions  --  including Santa Cruz , Seattle and the state of Minnesota  --  have passed similar laws . British Columbia is about to enact a gender identity law . <p> Although state law would generally prevent complainants from suing under the local ordinance , Brinkin explains , the city can help broker resolutions . The most frequent complaints involve employers ' refusal to allow transsexuals to dress in the style appropriate to their new sex or to use the corresponding rest rooms . <p> Sometimes , he says , co-workers mercilessly harass transsexuals , beat them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . <p> " Before we had the law here , " Brinkin says , " it was so frustrating and painful when people would come to me , because I could n't help them . " <p> James is a man of strong opinions . Here are some of them . <p> On feeling secure about his masculinity : <p> " When you think of someone who can find and hold comfortably their masculinity while in a female body , then being in a male body just makes it that much easier . " <p> On smiling : <p> " I had to learn to not smile as much , because that 's something women do to let people know you 're OK , like if you bump into someone on the street . Men do n't do that with other men . One time this guy looked like he was going to punch me out , because he saw it as a threat or come-on . " <p> On how his change has altered his relationships with women : <p> " I do n't express my anger any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Before , they always felt they could stand up to me . If I get angry now , my voice is louder , my body is stronger , and my anger is more likely to be called abuse or a threat . It really makes me sad . " <p> On the war between the sexes : <p> " I want to be perceived as a man , but I do n't want men to be perceived as villains all the time just because they 're men . I tell guys things that lots of women have told me  --  that what women want is to be paid attention to  --  because I 've been in a position to hear things from women that many men have n't . " <p> On bathroom etiquette : <p> " I do n't leave the toilet seat up . When the man does that , it 's as if he 's the only one in the house . " <p> On the effects of testosterone : <p> " First was an increase in libido . In four weeks , my voice started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped . And I felt calm , centered , grounded . I thought , ' This must be what normal feels like . ' This was something my body was ready for . " <p> Marcy Sheiner is an East Bay writer and critic . Funny and feisty , she is the mother of two grown children , and over the years she has been involved romantically and sexually with both women and men . She and James began dating in 1990 , although their relationship has undergone some painful changes in the past year . <p> The two first met when Marcy researched an article about FTMs for a lesbian magazine . At the time , she was steeped in traditional feminist rhetoric about transsexuality : when it came to sex roles and stereotypical gender behavior , Marcy always gave more weight to social conditioning than to genetic or hormonal influences . <p> But James ' obvious comfort in his masculinity  --  along with his apparent ability to discuss emotions and issues in a way not common among heterosexual men  --  forced her to reconsider her notions . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was expecting a freaky , weird , really whacked-out guy , and Jamie walked in looking like a banker in his suit and tie , " she recalls . " I was immediately taken aback . I started interviewing him , and the interview lasted about five hours . By the second hour , I started to get really intrigued and attracted . When he left , I felt suddenly like my apartment was really empty . I missed him already . " <p> The couple fell in love , and Marcy believed , at first , that she had at last found the man she could build a life with . She found agreement in surprising quarters . <p> " For instance , ( he ) has turned out to be , in my mother 's eyes , the most presentable man I 've ever been involved with , " she wrote in an article about their relationship . " After years of enduring  --  or , rather , ignoring  --  a parade of long-haired androgynous hippies , struggling musicians , and several women , she was delighted when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulated it among relatives in Florida as evidence that I 'd rejoined civilization . " <p> But the relationship has foundered in the past year or two on issues far from unknown to those engaged in standard heterosexual relationships : commitment and communication . <p> Marcy is disenchanted because James ' dedicated activism means that he has too little time to spend with her . He has become , she says , " the FTM poster boy . " She also feels that though his years in the lesbian community apparently helped him to learn how to discuss emotions , he is sometimes far more interested in his own perspective than in what she has to say . <p> She has discovered , in other words , that he really is a man . <p> " Sometimes she says to me , ' I ca n't believe you were ever a woman ! ' " says James with a sheepish grin . <p> A year ago , the pair planned to get married this month and booked a honeymoon in Hawaii . But several months ago , they called the wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionately on the way to dinner at a San Francisco restaurant . But over pumpkin ravioli and pasta with prawns , they banter openly about the changing nature of their relationship . <p> " We 're in a nonmonogamous , nonprimary relationship , " says James . " That 's the current status . Though neither of us is seeing anyone else right now . " <p> " Still , we torture each other about it , " she says . <p> " But we wo n't see anyone else before we go to Hawaii , because I do n't want my vacation ruined , " he says . <p> They clearly enjoy their tart repartee , although the underlying tension is apparent . " My son sometimes calls us Lucy and Ricky , " she concedes . <p> They are leaving this week on the Hawaii vacation , and the renegotiation of the relationship continues . <p> Though James was raised in the Presbyterian church , he no longer accepts the traditional notion of the deity . He understands that many people would feel he has violated the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet in his own way , he views his life as a spiritual journey that has brought him a gift that few people receive . <p> " As a transsexual , you get to observe things through a lens to which others do n't have access , " he says . " Once you go through this and you make yourself as vulnerable as we make ourselves , and as strong as we make ourselves , you really learn to accept people for who they are . <p> " People have said to me that God does n't make mistakes , and I agree with that , " he adds . " I think I was made this way so I could be given the opportunity to go through this adventure . When you find out what a pariah you can be , you learn not to take acceptance for granted . "
