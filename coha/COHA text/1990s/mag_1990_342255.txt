My three-year-old daughter is puzzled . Why , she wants to know , did Georgie Porgie kiss the girls and make them cry ? " Because he 's mean , " I say , with a sinking feeling , for how can this be the right answer ? As the rollicking little rhyme makes all too clear , young George is a clever rogue , all pudding and pie ; the tearful girls are merely boring . Mother Goose in one hand and a leaky juice box in the other , I begin the sad , infuriating task shared by all modern mothers of daughters : to raise my child to be confident , adventurous and happy in her gender in a society saturated with sexual violence and victim blaming . <P> Am I a humorless prude ? Given what we know about today 's America , certainly not . My mother could imagine rape was rare ; I know it is common . She wondered if my future husband would " deserve " me ; I wonder if my daughter 's will put her in the hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buying me a Barbie , and my husband and I will have that discussion too , one day . But whom are we kidding ? What 's one more sexist image in the current climate of meanspirited misogyny  --  Sam Kinison and Andrew Dice Clay , Jason and Freddy , 2 Live Crew  --  to which the woman-affirming alternative is supposed to be , of all people , Madonna , who dresses in armor-plated underwear and sings about liking to be spanked ? <P> Here are some facts to curl any woman 's hair . According to the Senate Judiciary Committee this past June , the rape rate is increasing four times as fast as the overall crime rate . One in five adult women has been raped , one in six by someone she knows . Between 3 million and 4 million women are beaten each year , 1 million so severely that they seek medical help . More than half of all homeless women are fleeing domestic violence . Think about that the next time a bag lady asks you for a quarter . <P> The one bright spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of our own consciousness . It is a triumph of modern feminism that an immense and very angry conversation is taking place among women nationwide . Society has been " sensitized " : we have rape hot lines and rape shield laws , battered-women 's shelters and **25;10422;TOOLONG legal defenses . Just how much real change is occurring , however , is open to question . Two years after the Washington police department directed officers to make arrests in domestic-violence cases , local women 's groups found that the policy was rarely enforced . But at least the subject is on the table  --  for women . <P> But what about men ? Sexual violence is not about female behavior , after all . It 's about male behavior . Physically , it may be women 's problem ; morally , it is men 's . But where , outside a few campus grouplets , is their conversation taking place ? Men 's magazines still use the subject to titillate , as when Esquire puts the dead Laura Palmer of Twin Peaks on the cover of its " Women We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-third of alleged group sexual assaults on college campuses are perpetrated by athletes ; fraternities are blamed for the majority of such attacks . Where are the coaches , the administrators , the alumni forever touting the value of male bonding ? Where is the outrage from the good kids , the ones who do n't gang-rape the drunken girl at the beer blast but hear their friends snickering about it the next day ?
