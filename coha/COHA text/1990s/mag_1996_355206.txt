There are some matters we can all agree on : motherhood and apple pie  --  good ; deadbeat dads  --  bad . That 's why , in this time of fbi files and Little Rock , Arkansas , trials , the President decided last week to announce some new measures to collect child support , which include screening new employees who may owe money and penalizing welfare mothers who refuse to identify the fathers of their children . <P> But it seems there is an opposition group on every issue , and one has emerged in California that might be called the Second Wives and the Deadbeat Dads Who Love Them Club . The day after Clinton announced the new crackdown , Dianna Thompson , spokeswoman for the 5,000-member Coalition of Parent Support  --  and a second wife herself  --  appeared on the Today show to criticize child-support orders that put " a real financial burden on the second family ... and really do n't reflect the cost of raising a child ... It 's more like a life-style support . " Now here 's a group that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wives , might cultivate to close their massive gender gap . It 's a group that appears to draw considerable energy from the thought that every dollar going to a first wife is a dollar taken from them . Already , in California , the coalition has helped pass a bill that excludes a second wife 's income in calculating a man 's ability to pay child support , and defeat legislation that would extend support beyond age 21 . Why should children of divorce go to grad school ? <P> Certainly , second wives , bent on protecting their own brood , have more moral authority than the men who have already left one brood behind . But even they may not be any match for market forces . New York City is considering a proposal from investment bankers at Morgan Stanley to get immediate payments to first families by selling high-interest bonds based on the assets of deadbeat parents . The Mommy-munis would be backed by the full force of the child-support-collection apparatus . <P> Bob Dole is having trouble snuffing out the controversy engendered by his suggestion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillip Morris ' ad campaign in Europe , which argues that passive smoke is less harmful than a glass of whole milk a day . This went over O.K. in Kentucky tobacco country but hovered over him like a cloud of stale smoke last week as he campaigned in California , which has some of the most draconian antismoking laws in the nation . At each stop , starting in Walnut Creek , Dole was trailed by a person dressed as a cigarette , dubbed Buttman , who handed out large dollar bills picturing " Smokin ' Bob " with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth . At a Woodland Hills event , Buttman placed himself on the balcony opposite the podium , directly in Dole 's line of sight . Yet the candidate did not acknowledge him , mindful , no doubt , that George Bush was ridiculed for talking back to the giant chicken that followed him around during the ' 92 campaign carrying a sign saying CHICKEN GEORGE WO N'T DEBATE . <P> A staff member from the state Democratic committee , which launched Buttman , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the vicinity . The answer was yes ; in fact , Buttman is following Dole to New York . This cigarette , at least , appears to be habit forming .
