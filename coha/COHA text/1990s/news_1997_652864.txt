<p> SHE OFTEN FEELS BURDENED BY conflicting demands . She keeps secrets from her mother . She goes to a high school perched atop the mouth of hell . <p> She is the heroine of " Buffy the Vampire Slayer , " a WB midseason replacement last spring that has blossomed in its first full season into a critical and cult favorite . ( There are more than 320 Web sites devoted to her every aspect . ) <p> Buffy is bad news for vampires . She 's the only hope of the living , nearly all of whom are oblivious both to their own peril and to the useful extermination service Buffy provides . And she looks great in her prom dress . <p> Everyone compliments her on the dress , even the undead , who not-so-incidentally are streaming forth from the bowels of the earth like commuters from the IRT . Buffy , who is played by Sarah Michelle Gellar , is television 's most stylish female hand-to-hand fighter since Diana Rigg played Emma Peel on " The Avengers " three decades ago . She tosses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp stick , unless she uses her crossbow instead . The world is saved , until 9 P.M. next Monday at least . But she never gets to go to the dance . <p> Buffy is a television teen-ager , a member of a venerable line that stretches back to Junior and Babs on " The Life of Riley " and includes the smarmy Eddie Haskell of " Leave It to Beaver , " the irrepressible Ricky Nelson , Dobie Gillis and his proto-freak pal Maynard G. Krebs , the Fonz , Patty Duke and her identical cousin , much of the Partridge family , the precocious physician Doogie Howser , some of the " Beverly Hills 90210 " cast and Steve Urkel . <p> Buffy 's life is more intense than her predecessors ' . She is , after all , struggling to survive on a splinter network in a multichannel world full of restless , remote-clicking viewers . More important , though , in her uniquely warped way , Buffy is an attempt to reflect the experience of teen-agers ' lives today . She is part of an unprotected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insecurities as well as its own . She rubs shoulders with monsters , and like many of her age-mates , she is sometimes suspected of being a monster herself . She 's powerful , responsible , scary to know  --  and perpetually at risk . <p> There are , of course , some ways in which Buffy is like her forebears . She lives through perennial television teen-ager plots . Will she get the cookies baked for parent-teacher night ? Will her male friend Xander stop lusting after the wrong women and realize that their female friend Willow is the salt of the earth ? And just where are things going with Angel , the object of her affections ? <p> There are , however , some odd twists . The woman who seduces Xander turns out to be a giant praying mantis , determined to bite off his head . Angel 's a vampire . And these teen-age television stories keep getting interrupted by scenes of supernatural mayhem and occult ickiness . Being a teen-ager used to be the stuff of comedies . Now it 's a horror show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says her mother when Buffy complains that she 's stressed out . Her mother does n't know that her daughter has been chosen as the only person on earth who can hold off the vampire menace . <p> " I have a job , " Buffy murmurs . Her mother does n't understand . Hardly anybody understands . <p> There 's nothing new about teen-agers feeling misunderstood , but there is something contemporary about Buffy 's weariness . Today , teenagers are working longer hours , often half time or more , and more girls are working than ever before , albeit at jobs less dangerous or interesting than Buffy 's . Her mother works , too , which is characteristic of more than 60 percent of American families with children . Her parents are divorced . Only a few friends help Buffy face her demons . <p> In contrast to " My So-Called Life , " the much-admired , self-consciously realistic canceled ABC series , which still turns up in reruns on MTV , Buffy is ( one hopes ) a fantasy . But in its scary-jokey way , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its vision is a good deal darker . <p> Television 's teen-agers have probably always told more about television than they have about teen-agers . Yet , at a time when news stories and broadcasts about teen-agers tend to emphasize violent crime , teen-age pregnancy and drugs  --  all problems that statistics suggest are lessening  --  entertainment series provide another perspective . They have to please young viewers and mirror their own lives . <p> Most current television shows that feature teen-agers show us young people who are highly responsible , independent and hard-working and who sometimes wish they could have a little more fun . That 's not the same picture that 's shown on the evening news or in newspapers , but it may be just as close to the truth . <p> Television and the phenomenon of teen-agers are about the same age . Both were invented just before World War II and burst onto the scene shortly after . Both are devices to create markets and sell things . Television is one way children learn how to be teen-agers . <p> MOST TELEVISION teenagers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the amusement of 11-year-olds . " In 10 years , I 'll be 27 , " a character on the UPN series " Clueless " remarked in a recent episode . " Almost old enough to play a teen-ager on television . " <p> Marketers call these younger viewers " aspiring teens . " They watch more television than real teen-agers , because they have more time . And they 're actually looking forward to being teen-agers , while those of high school age are inclined to view teen-agerhood as a predicament they long to escape . <p> These preteen-agers are part of a demographic bulge that represents a lot of buying power , now and in a few years , when they become full-fledged teen-agers . Teen-agers and preteen-agers today spend a significant amount of their families ' money . They go to the supermarket to shop for their overworked parents . They pick out much of their own clothing . With their status as loyal viewers and consumers , young people are probably granted more status and respect on television than in any other arena of American life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young viewers by allowing them to teach their parents a thing or two . In recent years , shows like CBS 's " Cybill " have depicted baby-boomer parents as crazy , mixed-up pseudoadolescents who depend on their sensible teen-age offspring to put things in perspective . This may , as some have argued , present a subversive view of family life . Still , adulthood today is less stable than it was when the Beaver was a boy . Re-engineered and downsized parents do have identity crises , though they usually last longer than the 22 minutes of a typical half-hour sitcom . Television may not be true , but neither is it wholly false . <p> Besides , as Margaret Mead pointed out , Americans expect to learn from their young , a characteristic she traced back to the immigrant experience . Rapid change makes immigrants of us all , and adults can only hope their children will be kind . <p> The precocious juvenile is one of television 's oldest comic devices , but ever since " Father Knows Best , " television has also made sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Beavis and Butt-head aside , television 's teen-agers have long reflected a tricky balance between the moral lessons parents hope their children will glean from watching too much television , and just enough coolness to make the characters believable to young people . <p> This formula still applies . The title character of " Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch " has magic powers , but the plots almost always involve a struggle to achieve self-control . The title character of " Moesha " is a brainy , beautiful , highly responsible African-American role model who sides with rappers against her snobbish prep school classmates . The young people on " Beverly Hills 90120 " career from crisis to instructive crisis , but they hold young viewers ' attention by living sexy , luxurious lives . <p> Even " Buffy , " which is aimed at an older audience of people who have experienced high school rather than those looking forward to it , teaches subtle lessons about the usefulness of knowledge , technological savvy , friendship and resourcefulness . <p> " Seldom does an American girl , whatever her age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexis de Tocqueville more than a century and a half ago . " She , like the European girl , wants to please , but she knows exactly what it costs . She may avoid evil , but at least she knows what it is . " He might have been talking about Buffy . <p> " We 're always very strict about what we have learned from a given episode , " says Joss Whedon , creator and executive producer of " Buffy the Vampire Slayer . " " We 're not very strict about feeding it to the viewer . The characters have experiences from which they learn . If people in the audience do n't get it , that 's O.K. , they probably had fun . " <p> Mr. Whedon , a third-generation television writer whose grandfather wrote about 1950 's and early 1960 's teen-agers in scripts for " The Donna Reed Show , " says he conceived Buffy as a role model . " She 's a hero in the strict sense , a leader , " he says . " She may be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the right thing anyway . " <p> As if dealing with sharp-toothed forces of evil were n't enough , the series has also acquired a real villain in the person of Snyder , the principal of Sunnydale High School . He sees Buffy 's future clearly : suspension , then perhaps expulsion , maybe a reformatory , almost certainly prison . " There are some people for whom teens are simply vicious little statistics , " Mr. Whedon says . " Snyder is one of those guys . " But , he adds mysteriously , " We have yet to see his true colors . " ( A sense of pervasive , indeterminate evil is one of Buffy 's strongest and most contemporary touches . ) <p> Contemptuous pessimism like Snyder 's can be dangerous to teen-agers . High school dropouts often feel that they were pushed out of school , by teachers and administrators who did n't want them around . More generally , such fear and loathing contribute to a tendency to see teen-agers not as people but as a bundle of things that can go wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pervasively punitive climate in which the list of crimes for which teen-agers are punished as adults continues to grow , while the other laws restrict young people 's autonomy . <p> Television shows rarely deal with such issues head on . They may make a joke , as the ABC supernatural sitcom " Teen Angel " did in its recent premiere , when the newly dead main character was told that only his youth had saved him from damnation . " All right ! " he exclaimed , in his best cool-dude , party-animal manner . " Tried as a minor ! " This is a practice that may still be followed at the Pearly Gates , but it 's less likely closer to home . <p> Throughout the current season , " Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch " is dealing indirectly and generally approvingly with legal and bureaucratic limits on teen-agers ' freedom . Many cities and suburbs have passed curfews , and recently several states have enacted or considered laws that make getting one 's driver 's license  --  a teen-age rite of passage  --  a gradual or conditional affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16th birthday that she was a witch , discovered this season , on her 17th birthday , that she needed a license to practice her craft . Failing the test during the season opener , she was sent to a quasi-military boot camp . And when she finally passed the test , she looked at the license and discovered that it was only a learner 's permit , portending a full season of new tests . <p> " When you 're a witch , you can wreak horror in people 's lives , " says Paula Hall , executive producer of " Sabrina " and the mother of Melissa Joan Hart , who plays the title role . " You can do the same when you take the wheel of the car . We 're not trying to hit anyone over the head with this , but the message is that power brings responsibilities . " <p> A bit like Buffy , Sabrina was spreading herself too thin ( schoolwork , extracurricular activities , romance and witchcraft ) , but in her case a solution was prescribed . It involved seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ACTUALLY , YOU RARELY SEE television teen-agers watching television . In fact , heavy viewership among teen-agers has been declining for many years . But unlike a majority of high school juniors and seniors , television teen-agers are rarely sexually active . <p> Because the teen-agers are played by physically attractive performers who are older than the characters they play , and because television comedy routinely depends on sexual innuendo , the insistence on their sexual inexperience can be bizarre . " If I was old enough to have sex , " said a sexily dressed high school girl on a recent episode of " Clueless , " " I 'd be withholding . " <p> Probably no television teen-ager has been as star-crossed in his sexual exploration as Xander , Buffy 's male pal . He 's still haunted by that experience with the praying mantis . A more recent romance , with a young woman who turned out to be the the mummy of an Inca princess who had to murder constantly to stay alive , went somewhat better . But it ca n't have been pleasant when her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scare kids and say , Do n't have sex , " says Mr. Whedon . " Some do . Some will . Some should . Some should n't . Still , one of the scariest and most important things is sex . Its going to come up . " <p> " This is a horror show , " he adds . " It 's going to go badly . "
