There was the incident of the rake and there was the incident of the school play , and it seems to me that they both took place at the round kitchen table . The table was not in the kitchen proper but in an area called " the nook , " which held its claim to that small measure of charm by dint of a waist-high wall separating it from an adjacent area known as the living room . All family meals were eaten in the nook . There was a dining room to the right , but , as in most rooms of that name at that time and in those surroundings , it was never used . The round table was of wrought iron and topped with glass ; it was noteworthy for that glass , for it was more than once and rather more than several times , I am inclined to think , that my stepfather would grow so angry as to bring some object down on the glass top , shattering it , thus giving us to know how we had forced him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he would shatter the table , as often as that might have been , he would cut some portion of himself on the glass , or that he or his wife , our mother , would cut their hands on picking up the glass afterward , and that we children were to understand , and did understand , that these wounds were our fault . So the table was associated in our minds with the notion of blood . The house was in a brand-new housing development in the southern suburbs . The new community was built upon , and now bordered , the remains of what had once been a cornfield . When our new family moved in , there were but a few homes in the development completed , and a few more under construction . Most streets were mud , and boasted a house here or there , and many empty lots marked out by white stakes . The house we lived in was the development 's Model Home . The first time we had seen it , it had signs plastered on the front and throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it had a lawn , and was one of the only homes in the new community that did . My stepfather was fond of the lawn , and he detailed me and my sister to care for it , and one fall afternoon we found ourselves assigned to rake the leaves . Why this chore should have been so hated I can not say , except that we children , and I especially , felt ourselves less than full members of this new , cobbled-together family , and disliked being assigned to the beautification of a home that we found unbeautiful in all respects , and for which we had neither natural affection nor a sense of proprietary interest . We went to the new high school . We walked the mile down the open two-lane road on one side of which was the just-begun suburban community and on the other side of which was the cornfield . The school was as new as the community , and still under construction for the first three years of its occupancy . One of its innovations was the notion that honesty would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lockers were designed and built both without locks and without the possibility of attaching locks . And there was the corresponding rash of thievery and many lectures about the same from the school administration , but it was difficult to point with pride to any scholastic or community tradition supporting the suggestion that we , the students , pull together in this new , utopian way . We were , in school , in an uncompleted building in the midst of a mud field in the midst of a cornfield . Our various sports teams were called The Spartans ; and I played on those teams , which were of a wretchedness consistent with their novelty . Meanwhile my sister interested herself in the drama society . The year after I had left the school she obtained the lead in the school play . It called for acting and singing , both of which she had talent for , and it looked to be a signal triumph for her in her otherwise unremarkable and unenjoyed school career . On the night of the play 's opening she sat down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that they ate a trifle early to allow her to get to the school to enjoy the excitement of the opening night . But however it was , my sister had no appetite , and she nibbled a bit at her food , and then she got up from the table to carry her plate back to scrape it in the sink , when my mother suggested that she sit down , as she had not finished her food . My sister said she really had no appetite , but my mother insisted that , as the meal had been prepared , it would be good form to sit and eat it . My sister sat down with the plate and pecked at her food and she tried to eat a bit , and told my mother that , no , really , she possessed no appetite whatever , and that was due , no doubt , not to the food , but to her nervousness and excitement at the prospect of opening night . My mother , again , said that , as the food had been cooked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said that she could not ; at which my mother nodded . She then got up from the table and went to the telephone and looked the number up and called the school and got the drama teacher and identified herself and told him that her daughter would n't be coming to school that night , that , no , she was not ill , but that she would not be coming in . Yes , yes , she said , she knew that her daughter had the lead in the play , and , yes , she was aware that many children and teachers had worked hard for it , et cetera , and so my sister did not play the lead in her school play . But I was long gone , out of the house by that time , and well out of it . I heard that story , and others like it , at the distance of twenty-five years . In the model house our rooms were separated from their room , the master bedroom , by a bathroom and a study . On some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and my sister would stay and sometimes grow frightened or lonely in her part of the house . And once , in the period when my grandfather , then in his sixties , was living with us , she became alarmed at a noise she had heard in the night ; or perhaps she just became lonely , and she went out of her room and down the hall , calling for my mother , or my stepfather , or my grandfather , but the house was dark , and no one answered . And , as she went farther down the hall , toward the living room , she heard voices , and she turned the corner , and saw a light coming from under the closed door in the master bedroom , and heard my stepfather crying , and the sound of my mother weeping . So my sister went up to the door , and she heard my stepfather talking to my grandfather and saying , " Jack . Say the words . Just say the words .... " And my grandfather , in his Eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " No . No . I ca n't . Why are you making me do this ? Why ? " And the sound of my mother crying convulsively . My sister opened the door , and she saw my grandfather sitting on the bed , and my stepfather standing by the closet and gesturing . On the floor of the closet she saw my mother , curled in a fetal position , moaning and crying and hugging herself . My stepfather was saying , " Say the words . Just say the words . " And my grandfather was breathing fast and repeating , " I ca n't . She knows how I feel about her . I ca n't . " And my stepfather said , " Say the words , Jack . Please . Just say you love her . " At which my mother would moan louder . And my grandfather said , " I ca n't . " My sister pushed the door open farther and said  --  I do n't know what she said , but she asked , I 'm sure , for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and saw her and picked up a hairbrush from a dresser that he passed as he walked toward her , and he hit her in the face and slammed the door on her . And she continued to hear " Jack , say the words . " She told me that on weekends when I was gone my stepfather ended every Sunday evening by hitting or beating her for some reason or other . He would come home from depositing his own kids back at their mother 's house after their weekend visitation , and would settle down tired and angry , and , as a regular matter on those evenings , would find out some intolerable behavior on my sister 's part and slap or hit or beat her . Years later , at my mother 's funeral , my sister spoke to our aunt , my mother 's sister , who gave a footnote to this behavior . She said when they were young , my mother and my aunt , they and their parents lived in a small flat on the West Side . My grandfather was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friday night . Their family had a fiction , and that fiction , that article of faith , was that my mother was a naughty child . And each Friday , when he came home , his first question as he climbed the stairs was , " What has she done this week ... ? " At which my grandmother would tell him the terrible things that my mother had done , after which she , my mother , was beaten . This was general knowledge in my family . The footnote concerned my grandfather 's behavior later in the night . My aunt had a room of her own , and it adjoined her parents ' room . And she related that each Friday , when the house had gone to bed , she , through the thin wall , heard my grandfather pleading for sex . " Cookie , please . " And my grandmother responding , " No , Jack . " " Cookie , please . " " No , Jack . " " Cookie , please . " And once , my grandfather came home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I do not know , but I imagine that the response was not completed , and perhaps hardly begun ; in any case , he reached and grabbed my mother by the back of the neck and hurled her down the stairs . And once , in our house in the suburbs there had been an outburst by my stepfather directed at my sister . And she had , somehow , prevailed . It was , I think , that he had the facts of the case wrong , and had accused her of the commission of something for which she had demonstrably had no opportunity , and she pointed this out to him with what I can imagine , given the circumstances , was an understandable , and , given my prejudice , a commendable degree of freedom . Thinking the incident closed she went back to her room to study , and , a few moments later , saw him throw open her door , bat the book out of her hands , and pick her up and throw her against the far wall , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was told , the next morning , that her pain , real or pretended , held no weight , and that she would have to go to school . She protested that she could not walk , or , if at all , only with the greatest of difficulty and in great pain ; but she was dressed and did walk to school , where she fainted , and was brought home . For years she suffered various headaches ; an X ray taken twenty years later for an unrelated problem revealed that when he threw her against the shelf he had cracked her vertebrae . When we left the house we left in good spirits . When we went out to dinner , it was an adventure , which was strange to me , looking back , because many of these dinners ended with my sister or myself being banished , sullen or in tears , from the restaurant , and told to wait in the car , as we were in disgrace . These were the excursions that had ended , due to her or my intolerable arrogance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy trips were celebrated and capped with a joke . Here is the joke : My stepfather , my mother , my sister , and I would exit the restaurant , my stepfather and mother would walk to the car , telling us that they would pick us up . We children would stand by the restaurant entrance . They would drive up in the car , open the passenger door , and wait until my sister and I had started to get in . They would then drive away . They would drive ten or fifteen feet , and open the door again , and we would walk up again , and they would drive away again . They sometimes would drive around the block . But they would always come back , and by that time the four of us would be laughing in camaraderie and appreciation of what , I believe , was our only family joke . We were raking the lawn , my sister and I. I was raking , and she was stuffing the leaves into a bag . I loathed the job , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viciously angry , and my sister said something , and I turned and threw the rake at her and it hit her in the face . The rake was split bamboo and metal , and a piece of metal caught her lip and cut her badly . We were both terrified , and I was sick with guilt , and we ran into the house , my sister holding her hand to her mouth and her mouth and her hand and the front of her dress covered in blood . We ran into the kitchen where my mother was cooking dinner , and my mother asked what happened . Neither of us , myself out of guilt , of course , and my sister out of a desire to avert the terrible punishment she knew I would receive , neither of us would say what occurred . My mother pressed us , and neither of us would answer . She said that until one or the other answered , we would not go to the hospital ; and so the family sat down to dinner where my sister clutched a napkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran down onto her food , which she had to eat ; and I also ate my food and we cleared the table and went to the hospital . I remember the walks home from school in the frigid winter , along the cornfield that was , for all its proximity to the city , part of the prairie . The winters were viciously cold . From the remove of years , I can see how the area might and may have been beautiful . One could have walked in the stubble of the cornfields , or hunted birds , or enjoyed any of a number of pleasures naturally occurring .
