From Part One : Wonderland Sarina On the eve of her sixteenth birthday , Sarina Summers got an overnight stay at Druid City Hospital . As her mother helped her through the emergency room doors , Sarina knew there was no turning back . This was it . She was serious about her future . " What happened to this child ? " the doctor exclaimed . " This child is drunk as a skunk and her fingers are broke ! " Sarina could not answer . She was totally shit-faced . " Honey ? " Mrs. Summers said . " Miss ? " said the doctor as he held Sarina 's eyes open by the brows . He lit up her pupils with a tiny flashlight . " Let me know if you can hear me . " He flicked the flashlight on and off . " Anybody home ? " " Honestly , " said Mrs. Summers . " Does she need to be fully conscious for this ? Could you just fix her fingers , please ? " Sarina nodded furiously and tried to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor . She said , " Hurts . " The room was spinning faster now . Noises echoed . She fell back . The impact against the pillow pushed her long brown curls across her white-washed cheeks . " I know it hurts , " said Mrs. Summers and , with her hands , combed the hair away . Sarina tried to focus her attention on how good her mother 's nails felt against her scalp . How the square-shaped acrylics were softer than what her mother grew naturally . It was a dull , comforting sensation . Her mother 's magic fingers . For a moment , she was calm . Sarina said , " Mmm . " " Yes , " said Mrs. Summers . " That 's my girl . Show the nice doctor that you 're ready . " Sarina felt the back of her mother 's hand against her jaw , her forehead . The doctor said , " What she 's readyto do is get her stomach pumped . " " Oh , no , " Mrs. Summers said . " No , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep it off . She 's drunk , not poisoned . " " I assure you , " said the doctor , " she 's as good as poisoned . " " Hurts , " said Sarina . She rolled her head from side to side . " Sarina , " said the doctor . " Are you with us ? Can you tell us what happened ? " Sarina kept her eyes shut . She choked back the sobs that crawled up her throat . " Mrs. Summers , " said the doctor , " I do n't know what kind of drinker your daughter is . " " She 's not one . " " Well , ma'am , she is one tonight . " Mrs. Summers crossed her arms and pressed down her breasts . The doctor said , " From the smell of her and from her limited response , I 'd say she 's put down a bottle of Jack Daniel 's . " Sarina heard her mother let out a long sigh . The doctor said , " Believe me , I want what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The doctor motioned to a woman in green scrubs drinking something from a Styrofoam cup . He said , " Nurse , take this patient to room nine . Prep her and get the hose . " The nurse held the rim of the cup in her teeth and used her free hands to push Sarina down the hallway . Sarina reached her hands , the bones of her two smallest fingers sticking out of the skin like straws , first in the air , then over her head toward her mother 's voice as it fell away with the pace of the gurney . Sarina heard her mother ask , " Ca n't I sit with her ? " She heard the doctor 's voice . " Waiting room . " She heard him say , " It 's the right thing . " She lost them . The nurse pushed Sarina 's arms down . " Keep still . This will be over before you know it . " Sarina rocked in the darkness . The gurney like a hammock . The cool , clear corridor like her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the nurse pried her teeth apart and the doctor pushed the hard warm hose to the back of her throat and then down and down . " Do n't fight it , " said the doctor . " You 're doing so good , " said the nurse . Sarina tried not to gag . She tried to be still . Mom , she thought , You said the worst part was over . You did n't tell me this part . " Hurts , " Sarina tried to say , but all that came out was a strained gurgling noise . " Almost over , " said the doctor . " You 're doing so good , " said the nurse . Sarina kept her eyes closed the way her mother had taught her ( In painful situations , you want to keep yourself from seeing what 's happening ) . Sarina reasoned with herself . I 'll just go to sleep . Over the course of the evening , she slipped in and out of consciousness . When she came to , the light through the blinds showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had slept for a week . She bet her eyes were bloodshot . Her neck ached from the position her arms were set . They were raised like Barbie 's in the box . Outside the window of the closed metal door , Sarina could see the heads of her mother and the doctor . " Mother , " she said , surprised by the scratch in her voice . " Mom , " she said a little bit louder . She watched her mother turn her head , bring her hand over her mouth , push open the door , and take three long strides to sit on the bed . " Honey , " Mrs. Summers gushed , " how are you feeling ? " " My throat hurts . " " I bet it does , " Mrs. Summers said . She looked accusingly over her shoulder at the doctor . The doctor said , " Sarina , can you tell us what happened ? " " Yes , " said Mrs. Summers . " What on earth ? " Sarina said nothing . " Did you fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hands in the car door ? " Mrs. Summers suggested . Sarina shook her head as the doctor and her mother continued to guess . " Volleyball ? " " Did you stick your fingers in the fan ? " " Moving furniture ? " " Did that nasty camp trunk shut on you ? " Sarina shook her head at all of these . She said , " I ca n't remember . " " Well , " said the doctor . " In any case , you 're lucky your mother found you . That must have been some party . " " It did n't happen at the party . " " I would have seen it , " said Mrs. Summers . " Ho-kay , " said the doctor . " I 've given your mother a prescription to help the pain when you come off the morphine . Take one pill when you need to . They 'll make you sleepy , which is okay , but they 'll make you nauseous if you do n't take them on a full stomach . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again looked over her shoulder at the doctor . " Well , " said the doctor . " Try to force something down . It will hurt a lot more coming up than it will going down . The nurse will be in to help you with your checkout . " He put his hands in his pockets and pulled the door open with his hands still in his lab coat . Sarina and her mother were alone . " How do your fingers feel ? " " I do n't really feel them . I 'm pretty woozy . " Mrs. Summers stood up and smiled down at her daughter . " You 've had some birthday . " Sarina nodded . Mrs. Summers ran her fingers across the soft pad that covered the metal splint of Sarina 's left pinky . She frowned . She said , " They cut your nail . " Sarina twisted her mouth in disapproval . Mrs. Summers peered over the bed to examine Sarina 's other pinky . They were identical , like two pieces of chalk . Mrs. Summers lightened . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " They 're going to be beautiful ! " " I know , " said Sarina . The nurse came in . As she was helped out of bed , helped into a wheelchair , helped into her mother 's car , Sarina remembered her party the night before . The invitations had read , " Please Join Me for a Sweet Sixteen Luau ! " Her mother had gone all out . She had cooked for days . She wrapped pineapple chunks in bacon and soaked them in honey . She went to Winn-Dixie and Piggly Wiggly and Kroger 's to gather enough from Alabama 's low supply of coconuts to gut them and make punch with the insides , drinks with the outsides . She bought tiny umbrellas and hung tissue-paper lanterns . She had the florist make leis for all the teenagers . When Sarina got home from the last day of tenth grade , she walked into the backyard , dropped her books , and spun until she could not stand it anymore . Hypnotized by the pastel colors and rented picnic tables , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mom ! " she said . " This is so great ! I ca n't believe you did this ! " Mrs. Summers sat down on the cement step in front of the sliding glass doors to the den . She smoothed her bangs into her new bob haircut sprung loose by the humidity of the approaching summer . The haircut was meant to make her look thin . To make herself look thin , Mrs. Summers wore tunic tops , black pants , and two coats of Maybelline Great Lash . Mrs. Summers smiled at her daughter sprawled in the grass like a little girl . She said , " You 're not a little girl anymore . " " Maw-hum ! " Sarina opened her mouth and rolled her eyes . She got to her feet and rushed to her mother . She sat in her lap and hugged her neck . " Stop ! " She put her head against her mother 's . She said , " Gawd , it 's not like I did anything special . " " But you will , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great things . " Sarina rolled her eyes again . She stuck her flat tongue between her teeth freed from braces a few weeks after Christmas . " Come on , " Sarina said , tugging her mother off the step . " Help me get ready . It 's an hour to five and you know one of the boys will show up right on time . " Mrs. Summers said , " Okay . " She pulled open the sliding door and followed her daughter into the den . As she slid the door shut , Mrs. Summers stared out into the big backyard . She thought , Once the sun goes down , those pines will almost look like palms . She said , " Did you see the roses your father sent ? They 're in your room . " Sarina had reached her room by this point . She called to her mother , " Mom ! Come on ! " Mrs. Summers turned from the party-in-waiting . With her back against the glass , she prayed for it not to rain , then walked through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarina put her hair in rollers , lined her lips , and asked for help with the zipper to the sundress they had chosen two months ago . After the party , Sarina grinned and swayed like a punching bag in the center of the kitchen . Mrs. Summers said , " Somebody 's had too much punch . " Sarina said , " Somebody spiked it ! " Mrs. Summers looked at the ceiling . She put her index finger to her chin . She said , " I wonder who . " Sarina gawked . " You are too cool . " " I suppose I am , " said Mrs. Summers . She pointed to the glazed ham . " Put some tinfoil on that , will you ? " Sarina did as she was told and helped her mother lift the ham and slide it onto the bottom shelf of the fridge . " That 's the last of it , " Mrs. Summers said . " You ready ? " " Uh-huh ! " Mrs. Summers slapped her daughter 's face so hard Sarina lost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes wide and bit her lip in an effort not to cry . Mrs. Summers frowned . " No you 're not . " She offered her daughter a sheet of Bounty to dry her tears . " I bet that smarts . Goddamn weak punch . " She took her daughter by the wrist to the rumpus room downstairs . She sat her in a chair by the edge of the Ping-Pong table . From her apron pocket , Mrs. Summers produced a shot glass and bottle of whisky . She said , " Pour yourself a drink and I 'll get things ready . " As Sarina screwed the lid off the bottle , she took a good look at her crooked pinkies . The top joints bent toward the other fingers . Her father used to tease her . He said it was like those pinkies were trying to do a U-turn . On a routine physical , Mrs. Summers had asked the pediatrician , " Can these be fixed ? " " Not in any way you 'd want to , " the pediatrician had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . What your daughter 's got is a recessive trait . Like widow 's peaks and attached earlobes . " Sarina filled the shot glass to the lip . She held it with both hands . She whispered , " Like braces . " She had four more shots . Mrs. Summers stood behind her and ran her fingers through her daughter 's hair . She twisted it . Let it loose . Started a braid . " How you doing ? " she asked and put the back of her hand against Sarina 's damp forehead . " Feeling no pain ? " " Do n't slap me again . " Mrs. Summers said , " I wo n't . " Mrs. Summers walked around the Ping-Pong table . She poured a shot . She put it in her daughter 's hands . " Drink , honey . " Sarina nursed the whisky . " I do n't feel so good . " " That 's a good sign , " said her mother . " Keep working that drink . Shut your eyes . Do n't pay any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her mouth . She tried to decipher the weird sounds in the room . A giant thud on the Ping-Pong table . A lot of ripping . Then her mother took the shot glass away . She fiddled with Sarina 's wrists and hands and fingers . " Have another , " Mrs. Summers said . " Be a good girl . " Sarina could feel the shot glass at her mouth . She felt her mother tilt her head back and guide the liquid down . She took a peep . In front of her , Sarina saw her arms outstretched , her wrists duct-taped to a cinder block . Except for her pinkies , her fingers were curled into fists and taped . Her pinkies laid out and taped . The cinder block taped to the table . Her mother standing before it all . " Oh , " cried Sarina . She was too drunk to speak . " Be a good girl , " Mrs. Summers said as she picked up the ax . She lifted it , blade backwards , over her shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told . On the ride home from the hospital , Sarina thought It was n't that bad . The last thing she remembered was her mother bringing the ax down and the crack of the first of her two fingers breaking .
