Do you like hockey but do n't care for cold weather ? Then field hockey might be the game for you ! Originally called " hurley " in Ireland , Ushinty " in Scotland , " bandy " in Wales , and " hackie " in England , this oldest of the stickand-ball games has been around a long time and will probably be around a long time from now , too . So you 've got plenty of time to learn to play it yourself . Thought too rough for women at first , the game today is dominated by women , though both men 's and women 's teams have competed in recent Olympics . // The Game Field hockey is played on a rectangular field slightly smaller than a soccer field , with a goal at each end . Each team has eleven players , including forwards , midfielders , or links , back fielders , a sweeper , and a goalie . Field hocky players are all specialists , but players depend on one another . Those in the forward line have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forward line and watch for opportunities to score . They also play defense when the other team has the ball . The sweeper supports the back fielders in defending the goal . Equipment Besides the distinctive short kilt that women players wear ( usually over shorts ) , the most important pieces of equipment are the stick , shin and mouth guards , and proper shoes . Your height determines how long your hockey stick should be . From the ground , the top of the stick should be within three to four inches of your hipbone . If your stick is too short , you 'll miss the ball when you swing . Too long and you 'll hit the ground behind the ball . A field hockey ball is slightly larger than a baseball and just as hard . Field hockey is a fast-moving , physical game . When sticks and feet go flying , injuries are possible . Shin guards tucked inside heavy socks help protect the calves and shins . A mouth guard is vital to protect your teeth . Field hockey shoes have cleated soles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes are also light and flexible . Since they have to knock down or catch a hard ball hurtling at them at high speed , goalies need extra protection : a helmet , face mask , leg pads , and foot pads called kickers . Sidebar Here are some of the moves a good field hockey player can perform . Drive : a hard stroke with a backswing . Dribble : moving the ball down the field using a series of short strokes . Flick : wrist stroke with no backswing . Push : a quick wrist stroke with no backswing . Reverse Stick : turning the stick over to tackle a player on the right or to play a ball on the left . Scoop : lifting the ball slightly with the toe of the stick . // <p>
