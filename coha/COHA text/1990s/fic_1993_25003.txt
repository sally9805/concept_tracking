 | Joe shrugged . He had given Hue another chance , but Hue could n't take it . He had failed their challenge , and was not qualified to be one of the water folk . He turned away . Then he saw a large shore bird flying close . It passed over the pond , winging up toward some distant perch . Hue hurled his axe at it , using his favored arm , which was n't the same as those of most other men . The axe spun as it sailed , glinting in the slanting sunlight . It curved , intersecting the bird . Then the axe struck the bird on the wing . The bird squawked and flopped down , landing in the pond . Hue waded into the water to fetch it . He caught it as it struggled , wrung its neck , and tossed it beside the fish . " Bird eat , " he said . He left the pool and went to recover his axe , where it had fallen beyond the pool . There was blood on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returned it to his pouch . Only then did he realize that the tribesfolk were staring at him . Itt 's mouth was locked open . Had Hue done something wrong ? Should he have tried to use his other arm , to be more like one of them ? Bil shook his head , seeming amazed . " Day day day , " he said , and the others nodded agreement . Hue had been granted his extension after all ! " Bird easy , " he protested . " Fish hard . " Several of the men shook their heads . " Bird hard , " Joe said . Now Hue understood . His tribe was apt at throwing ; any man could bring down prey by air , if it was close enough and slow enough and small enough . The farther a man could throw with force and accuracy , the better valued he was as a hunter . Hue had not been the best or the worst thrower , but he was competent . The water folk were apt at swimming and hunting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , but hard to bring down a bird . So their routine fish hunt was beyond him  --  and his routine bird hunt was beyond them . But they respected his prowess as a hunter , now that they had seen it . " Learn water , " Joe said . " Woman show . " He looked at the women seated around the pool . Several of them got to their feet . One of them was Ann , the one with whom he had shared the fish . Lee went to join them . Hue realized that more was expected of him , in the next three days . He had to learn more about the water , and one of these women would teach him . These were the ones who were willing to do so . All were breasted except Lee , but none of them had babies . So they were probably unmated . Just what were they supposed to show him ? He suspected that their willingness to do this meant that they found him to be acceptable for mating . Because of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their bareness and breastedness , and to their somewhat fleshy legs , but still was not eager to mate with any . Yet Lee SHAME OF MAN 91  | was no better , despite being furred and almost flat of chest . He was beginning to see women through the eyes of the men of the water folk , and if he had to mate with any , it should be with a fully adult one who did not remind him strongly of his sister . Of course he could depart the tribe at the end of the time , not mating with any . He was an outsider . One of the women was outcast . That was an affinity , of a kind . So he pointed to Ann . She looked surprised . She looked around , as if to make sure he had n't indicated one of the others . She had been willing to teach him , but had n't expected to be chosen . So he spoke her name . " Ann . " And smiled . She smiled too , and came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who looked disappointed . But not grief-stricken . That was reassuring ; it meant that mating was not what was expected . Ann came to stand close before him . " Ann thank , " she murmured . He decided not to try to explain his reason for choosing her . But he appreciated her thanks . " Show ? " " Forage . " She glanced up at him , and away , as she spoke . " Child forage . Woman forage . Man hunt . " But he had not been a child among the water folk , so had not learned how to forage their way . So he had to get that experience , if he wanted to join the tribe . They assumed that joining was his ambition . " Hue forage , " he agreed . He would learn woman 's work . After what he had seen of their way of catching a fish , and their stick shelters in the water , he knew that there was much he did not know , and he did want to learn it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the edge of the water , where other women were resuming work . Lee followed , evidently unwilling to give up on him yet . Hue was n't clear why she had n't been working before , but suspected that her job had been him : guiding him , keeping him out of mischief , so that no one else had to bother . If she got him to mate with her , all right , but until that time she had been responsible for him . Now it seemed Ann was responsible , so Lee had to resume ordinary work . But she could do it where she chose , and she chose to do it near Hue . Ann kneeled in the shallow water , facing the shore , and leaned forward . Hue saw how her breasts became globular , almost touching the surface . Yet she was n't nursing ! He knew now that it was the way of the water folk , but he kept being surprised anew , and a bit repelled . Surely it was not pleasant for a woman to seem always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands into the muck . She moved them slowly around . Hue imitated her , not sure what the point was . All he found was mud . Lee joined them on the other side , doing the same . But after a time , Ann raised one hand , holding a clam . She showed it to him , then put it in her pouch . Oh  --  they were clam hunting . Hue had never done this before , because the mountain streams near his tribe did n't have  | clams ; they had traded with neighboring tribes for them . This was interesting . He searched with vigor , now that he knew what he was doing . And soon he found a clam himself . By early evening they had each found several clams , and Hue 's back was sore from the constant bending over . They brought the clams to the cookfire , where they were added to those brought by other women . Roasted clam was a pleasant change from the constant fish . But there was also roast bird , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for that . Hue realized that the water folk did n't get to eat bird often . Probably the fowl of the water were wary of them , and were not as stupid as the big fish were . Then they went to the island stick shelters for the night . But this time I I ue went with Ann , not Lee . She had a different alcove in the women 's and children 's dome , but otherwise it was the same . She did not try to sleep against him , or to tempt him into mating , but the region was small enough so that they had to lie touching . Actually that did make it a bit warmer , in the absence of blankets . On the following day Ann showed him how they foraged for reeds . These were hollow , but not perfectly so . They found good , large ones , and used small straight sticks to poke through them and get them clear . Hue learned how to do it , but was curious about the reason . " Reed why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to like her smile , for there was no meanness or subterfuge in it , just pleasure . He had the impression that she liked his company , perhaps being flattered that he had chosen her to be his teacher . She put an end of the reed in her mouth and sank down under the water , in the way these folk could so readily do . She did not come up , and after a moment he realized that she was breathing through the reed , which stuck up above the surface . And that , he realized , was how the men had been in ambush , when the raiders came . Breathing under the murky water , wielding ropes , catching the ankles of the raiders and pulling them down . They did not do it to friends , only to enemies , never showing themselves . So the raiders did not dare enter the water , lest they fall victim to what they could not see . Lee laughed , seeing his comprehension on his face . Now he knew what would have happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the water , the first day . That night there was a storm . The thunder was very loud , and the rain sounded on the domes , but only a few drips penetrated the tight mass of sticks . It was dark , but Hue felt Ann shivering beside him . He realized that she was afraid of the storm , as many folk were . So he did what seemed proper : he wrapped his arms around her and drew her in close against him . SHAME OF MAN 93  | " Storm hurt no , " he murmured into her mass of hair by her ear . " Light , noise , hurt no . " He felt her relax , comforted . In that embrace they slept . He realized , coincidentally , that however odd this woman might appear by day , she was quite comfortable to hold by night . The softness of her flesh made up for her lack of fur , and her warm female body was appealing . On the following day they foraged for sticks for the water shelters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they did not leak . He had appreciated the way they kept most of the storm off , so knew this was useful work . In the afternoon they used their sticks to repair damaged sections of the domes , and to shore up weak ones . There was an art to it that it was difficult for him to follow ; somehow Ann and the other women were able to bend the thin sticks and weave them together with their attached leaves to make a blanket-tight layer . But there were also animal skins there , completing the job . On the third day with Ann , Hue still had no serious expectation of joining the tribe . But he found he was getting more comfortable with it . The ways of the water folk were different from those of his own tribe , sometimes startlingly so , but he was learning that there was a certain underlying similarity . Hunting fish was perhaps like hunting birds , only in water instead of on land or in the air . Swimming was like walking  --  and indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the water . The people seemed less odd as he got to know them individually ; they were much like those he had known before . It occurred to him that it might after all be worthwhile to mate with a woman of the water folk , so as to join this special society for the rest of his life . But he still did not want to do it with Lee . This day they were herding fish to the pond  --  many small ones . All the women and children and a few men spread out under Itt 's direction to circle the school and splash , scaring the fish to the pond . Hue had a notion how that was done , though he still could n't sense fish with his fingers the way the others could . But he could splash water with the best of them , and that did help herd the fish . He was positioned between Ann and Lee , with other women and children spread out beyond . He was coming to know some of the others . He saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by fire and was always eager to help tend it . She was a small , thin girl , about ten years old , but nice of feature and an excellent swimmer ; she would one day be a good woman . ' Chen something strange happened . The water rippled , though there was no wind  --  and the ripple went right down to the bottom . Hue could feel it throughout his body . The others did too ; they looked at each other , and all around , trying to fathom the nature of this effect . It was as if some truly monstrous fish were coming , pushing the water before it  --  but there was no such creature . lie saw that Ann on one side and Lee on the other were as 94 PIERS ANTHONY  | baffled as he was . Little Ember looked fascinated rather than frightened by the oddity , while others seemed poised to flee the water . None of them knew what was happening . But it did n't seem to be dangerous , merely strange . After a moment there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and the land , as if something huge had fallen to the ground . That made Hue concentrate , remembering something he had forgotten . " Rock fall , " he said . Others turned to him . " Hue live mountain , " he explained . His tribe had been near mountains , some of which had very steep slopes . " Rock fall . " He made a gesture as of something dropping down . " Loud . " Indeed , the neighboring avalanche had terrified the tribesmen . But it had stopped , and no one had been hurt . Later they had gone out to the region and found the new pile of stones in the valley , and realized that they had come sliding and rolling down from some high face of the mountain . So it was an ordinary event , just a rare one . Hue remembered the special sound of it , and what he had just heard was similar , though muffled by distance . The water folk relaxed , understanding the principle . They could see the peaks of distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This one must have been really big , because the peaks in that direction were barely visible , being far away . So the land and water had shaken with the impact , but no harm had been done . The fish herding resumed . Hue realized that this was similar to the herding of rabbits and other small game that his tribe had done , driving them into a canyon where they could be slaughtered . The ways of the water differed from the ways of the land , yet had an underlying similarity when understood . He grasped only a small part of the water life as yet , but was coming to appreciate it better as he learned more . He realized that he would regret leaving it tomorrow . Someone screamed . It was Ember , fleeing an ominous ripple . " Croc ! " her mother cried , alarmed . There was pandemonium . Women and children alike tried to escape the creature . The other men were on the far side of the skirmish line , too far away to help immediately . Itt started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time to deal with it . But Hue was close . He did not know what kind of a fish this was , but he knew the duties of a man when there was a threat . He brought out his axe and lunged for the ripple . But Lee was between him and it . As he sought to pass her , the ripple veered toward her . A very long green mouth opened , horrendously toothed , and closed on Lee 's arm . Lee screamed piercingly with pain and fear as the creature pulled her off her feet . Hue swung his arm . He struck the green snout . The flesh was tough , but his edge cut into it . The jaws parted and Lee jerked herself away . SHAME OF MAN 95  | Now the croc focused on Hue . It was quick enough to know its enemy . Its mouth opened again , snapping at his head . But though Hue had never seen a creature like this before , he had once fought a predator of the land . He knew better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point of his axe and stabbed it upward , into the descending upper jaw . He struck a tooth , and then the flesh around the tooth , and twisted , grinding the sharp rounded edge against whatever was there . An axe was a deadly weapon as well as a tool , and he did know how to use it . The creature moved away , swimming far more swiftly than any person could . It circled , and came back for another attack . But in the brief respite , Hue realized that he had been doing it wrong . The thing had its horrendous long mouth , and that mouth was deadly ; it was bound to chomp Hue if it kept trying . But the mouth had to open before it could close on anything . So Hue leaped to embrace the creature , wrapping his arms around its snout , squeezing it closed . He might as well have embraced a lion ! The croc whipped its head about , trying to throw him off , and its stout tail lashed at his legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was ragged , and it could do him damage . Hue had either to let go , or to get close enough to stop that tail . So he folded his body and wrapped his legs around the creature . But this meant that he was no longer standing . The croc rolled , and Hue 's head was under water . He could n't breathe , but neither could he let go . So he did the only thing remaining : he let go of the snout with his axe arm , and struck where he hoped the throat was , digging the point in hard . The croc struggled mightily , but Hue hung on , carving with his axe . Until his lack of breath overcame him , and he felt his consciousness fading . He felt his arms letting go of the croc , and felt the water coming into his mouth . Something was jamming down on his back , squeezing him unmercifully . Hue choked , and water poured out of his mouth . He coughed , and choked again . What was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach , and Itt was beating the water out of him . He had nearly drowned , but Itt had hauled him out and done what he knew to do , shaking and squeezing until he started breathing again . Itt had saved him . But as his body and head cleared , he remembered what else had been happening . " The croc  --  Lee ? " " Lee , " Lee repeated . Now he saw her , with mud caking her arm where the croc had bitten her . That meant that the women were treating her , covering up the wounds . " Hue owe no . " She looked sad , but perhaps it was because she was in pain . 96 PIERS ANTHONY  | She gave him credit for saving her life , as perhaps he had , and regarded his debt to her as having been acquitted . He would no longer have to mate with her , if he did n't want to . That was a relief , because though he might not remain with the water folk , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was now even with Lee . " Croc , " he said , now concerned about what other mischief the savage creature might have done . He did n't know whether he had driven it off . Bil and Joe were now here . Bil pointed to a thing on the beach nearby . It was the croc , dead . It seemed much smaller , somehow , being no longer than a man . Its throat region had been so severely lacerated that it would not have been recognizable if seen alone . It seemed that Hue had managed to do the job before he faded out . " Axe , " he said , remembering his most valuable possession . Ember stepped forward , the axe in her hand . She must have gotten it from the muck after they dragged Hue and the croc out . She gave it to Hue , smiling prettily . He remembered that she had been at one time in the path of the croc , so perhaps she felt he had saved her too . If he had , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . " Day , " Bil said then , spreading his arms as if to include the whole land . That meant that the time limit was off ; Hue could remain with the tribe as long as he wished , though he could not actually join it unless he mated with one of its women . They were satisfied that he was worth having with them . Then the group dispersed . Ann came to tend to him , bringing him food . He saw the women returning to the water , reorganizing for the fish drive , which had been broken up . " Fish , " he said , trying to get up . She pushed him gently down . " Hue no , " she said , and smiled to show that this was a privilege rather than an exclusion . He remained somewhat shaky , so perhaps this was best , because he might not be much good in the line . Evidently Ann was out of it , too , to take care of him . Hue 's head ached and his chest felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann made him lie flat on the ground , and she put her hands on him and kneaded his flesh , and that felt good . She hummed in the mode of healing . She knew the art of women , to make a tense or injured man relax . Her hands were thin , like the rest of her , but competent , and the pleasure they brought him made them beautiful . In fact as he lay there and let her massage him it was as if the pleasure spread from her hands to her arms and to her body , so that it no longer seemed badly shaped . Her legs were still somewhat thick , her hips too broad , and her waist too small , but now these proportions seemed right for her . Her breasts were still swollen , but actually not as much as for a fully nursing woman , and that partial development now seemed normal , as indeed it was for the women of the water folk . Even her jutting chin was not really ugly , and he realized that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw would he protected by that buttress of bone so that she would not starve alter such injury . Ile had seen SHAME OF MAN 97  | the pitiful state of a man who had taken a jaw injury , able to eat only with pain , and knew that if he himself ever got struck on that vulnerable spot he would suffer similarly . So Ann , somehow , had a more sensible face . That night , when he still did not feel good , Ann wrapped her arms around him and held him close , much as he had with her when the storm frightened her , and she hummed again , as if to a sick child , and he slept without difficulty . Next day Joe was waiting outside the shelter . " Come , " he told Hue . So he left Ann and went to join the men . He had been promoted , and no longer had to learn the ways of women . Now he began to learn the water ways of hunting . They used thin wood spears instead of axes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the region . Itt gave him a spear and showed him how , frowning without comment when Hue used what was considered to be the wrong hand . On this day they did not find any such prey , but they freely described how it was done . Hue also learned that they systematically hunted any crocs they found , keeping them out of the tribe 's foraging region . The one that had attacked Lee had been an aberration , perhaps disoriented by the distant rockslide and shudder of water . The men felt that Hue had done a bold thing , fighting it alone with his axe . He was of stouter build than they , more muscular , stronger , so had been able to do it , but still they were impressed by the way he had n't hesitated . It seemed that the women had told every detail , more than he remembered , of his fight with the reptile , with Lee being especially eloquent . He had shown courage on behalf of the tribe , when he had not been obliged to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that when a stranger entered the water on hostile business , men concealed amidst the reeds  --  sometimes under water , breathing through the stems  --  had only to pull on those ropes to interfere with the legs . There were loops along the ropes , that could catch ankles . There were trench-pits , covered by fine nets and a thin layer of mud , some with sharpened stakes below . The women knew where they were , and avoided them ; Hue had been placed between Ann and Lee not merely because he had been associating with them , but because they would steer him clear of mischief underfoot . They had not expected mischief to seek them out . And they talked passingly about women . Hue , recognizing the opening , mentioned that he realized that he would have to mate with one in order to join the tribe , and that he was getting more interested in the ways of the water folk , but of the two women who had shown interest , one reminded him of his little sister , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe agreed , touching his own receding lower jaw , which was like Hue 's . " Chin no , Ann yes . " And the others murmured agreement . 98 PIERS ANTHONY  | Actually Hue had been more concerned with her thinness and almost complete hairlessness . But he realized that all the water folk were thin and hairless , except for their heads and crotches , so of course they regarded such qualities as esthetic . Their other women tended to be broad of hip and narrow of waist , too . And breasted , with rounded legs . So by their definition , Ann was indeed beautiful . And he , having figured out the possible usefulness of the chin , had concluded that that need not be an objection . So it made her different from the others ; so did his hair and build make him just as different . So in that sense they were reasonably matched . " Lee young , " another man said . He was Vik . " Vik sister no . Fur . " He shrugged . That was Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes people . " Fur bad no , " Bil said , glancing at Hue . " Fur bad no , " Vik agreed . " Lee yes . " Hue felt good . Because they were accepting him , and he was furred , Lee 's similar liability was diminishing . So she might after all be able to find a mate within the tribe . The following day they did find prey , a baby hippo they were able to isolate from its mother and stab to death . Then they floated the carcass back to the home beach for butchering . Hue was getting more comfortable with the ways of water hunting , learning them quickly because of their underlying similarity to what he had known . He realized that he would never be as good at them as the natural water folk were , but at least he was making fewer errors . That night there was another storm . Hue did n't wait for Ann to be frightened ; he embraced her immediately . But the storm held off , not coming close . Ann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see anything , but he felt her mouth stretching . He had embraced her without cause . He smiled back , not minding . Then she put her hand on his penis and paused . She was silently offering him sex , in appreciation for his protection . Surprised , he considered . His penis became immediately hard , indicating his body 's interest . He no longer found her sexually uninteresting . But he was n't sure he wanted to mate with her , with the attendant commitment . So he reached down and gently removed her hand . Then he held her close , to show that he was not rejecting her , only declining to go that far . She relaxed against him , satisfied . Soon she was asleep , breathing softly against him . But he remained awake . Now that he had declined her offer , he wondered whether he should have . His penis remained hard . No , he did not find her unattractive , here in the night . But what of the day ? Then the storm abruptly moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat down . Ann woke , frightened , and he turned into her and SHAME OF MAN 99  | tightened his embrace , to reassure her . She felt his hard member against her belly and paused in her fright long enough to inquire again . But again he declined  --  and then wondered why he had done so . He did desire her , and would desire her by day . But the major step of mating with her and joining the tribe  --  that put him into deep doubt . The thunder eased , but the rain continued . Ann relaxed . But still his penis was hard against her . This time she slid up to put her mouth to his ear . " Ann tell no , " she whispered . So she would give him sex , and not announce it as a mating , leaving him free . In the steady noise of the rain it would be possible for them to do it , and others would not overhear . He was sorely tempted . It would be so easy . But still he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret . She did n't question his decision , but neither did she withdraw . She went to sleep with his hard penis against her . And , finally , he slept too . The rain continued the next day , sometimes light , sometimes heavy . When it was n't torrential , they could tell by the sound of distant thunder and the sight of lightning flashes that it was raining just as hard elsewhere . The water folk could n't hunt or forage during such a storm , because they were all wary of the thunder . In fact , none of them would go into the water while there was thunder . So they had to remain in the shelter , just clear of the water . " Why ? " Hue asked , perplexed . His tribesmen had hunted in the rain ; it actually helped them for some prey , because it could confuse the animals . " Water kill , " Ann explained . He could make no sense of that . As far as he could tell , it was an untested belief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all of them were adamant ; none would touch the water . When there was a lull , they dived out in a long line , and swam for the beach , where they went into the brush to defecate . Hue did the same . Then they tried to make a fire so as to cook some of the hippo meat , but the moment it got fairly started , the rain returned , threatening to douse it . Ember was disgusted , evidently believing that she could make a fire that would survive the rain . But she was only a girl-child , without authority in such matters . Hue had encountered this before . He broke a leafy branch from a tree and brought it to hold over the fire , so that the rain struck the leaves and ran down to the side , sparing the flame . It was still possible to cook . Ember clapped her little hands , pleased . But the others fled to the water and to the shelters , so as to reach them before the thunder struck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . She looked longingly hack at the flame as she entered the 100 PIERS ANTHONY  | water . Hue , disgusted , remained protecting the fire . Only Ann stayed with him , though she seemed reluctant . " Storm no , " she said , looking fearfully into the sky . He had n't meant to get her caught out in it , knowing her concern . He lowered the branch . " Go shelter , " he said . But it was too late . Bright light flashed , reflecting from the water , and soon thunder came . She would not touch the water now . So he did the next best thing . He broke off more branches , chopping with his axe when he had to , and quickly formed a kind of shelter by the fire . It was far from perfect , but it did deflect the brunt of the rain , so that the fire continued to burn . Then he carved off some chunks of hippo and impaled them on sticks so that the two of them could roast them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire . But the storm got worse than before , and soon managed to extinguish the fire and soak both of them . Winds swirled , making leaves dance , and blew apart the shelter . They had to flee to the protection of the larger trees of the forest . They ate some of the meat , then huddled together in the sluicing water , gazing at the nearby surface of the lake . Lightning stabbed down , striking the water . There was a sizzling sound . The thunder came at the same time , deafeningly . Ann screamed ; he could n't hear her , but felt her shoulders moving with it . He held her as closely as he could , but there was no way he could entirely stop her fright . The fact was , he was scared himself , though of course he could not admit it . Then he saw something strange . Things were floating on the water . As he peered , trying to figure out what they were , Ann explained : " Fish dead . Thunder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have believed it if he had n't just seen it . That was why the water folk stayed out of the water during a storm ! They knew that they could be killed too . Somehow the thunder did in the water what it did not do on land , becoming not only deafening but deadly . So they could not return to the shelter until the storm passed  --  and it showed no sign of doing that . On occasion a storm lasted for days , and this seemed to be one of those . So Hue left Ann huddling against a large tree , gathered more branches and rocks , made a better shelter , and plaited fine branches so as to overlap the leaves and make it as tight as possible . Large rocks weighted down the ends of the branches , and vines tied them together . Then he brought Ann to it and drew closed the small entrance . Now they were insulated from the rain , except for some inevitable drips , and perhaps more important , from the wild appearance of the outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she relaxed . He had restored some of what they had lost by being cut off from the water shelter . But they were caught alone , isolated front the tribe , and he knew that Ann felt nervous about it . She was a creature of the tribe and though she SHAME OF MAN 101  | had been somewhat outcast within it because of her chin , she needed it . He had known first that he would have to mate with her to join the tribe ; now he knew that he had to join the tribe to mate with her , because she could not exist apart from it . Lee was feisty and independent , ready to leave the tribe if she had to to get what she wanted , but Ann was a creature of her people . If he were ever to leave the tribe , he might not be able to take her with him . That could have been part of what made him hesitate , before . Did he want to be locked into the water folk ? What else did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he did not care to return there . Bub had offered to have him mate with Sis if he joined their tribe , but that did n't completely appeal either . So the water folk seemed best . All he had to do was commit to Ann  --  and he was about ready to do that . He was coming to like her very well . But there was one more thing : how did she feel about him ? She had offered to train him for the women 's work , and had stayed with him when he went on to man 's work , but that might mean just a continuing responsibility until he went to some other woman . She had offered him sex , but that might be from appreciation for his support , or just general courtesy . He needed to know how well she liked him for himself , and whether she wished to commit to him permanently . He tried to ask her . " Ann Hue like ? " She glanced at him . " Sex ? " They were sitting beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she could see that . " No . " " Yes , " she decided . " Owe . " She shifted position , seeking a way to lie down in the cramped shelter . " No ! " But of course that was n't clear . " Ann owe no . " She gave him a straight look . " Ann want . " But was she saying it to free him of obligation , so that she could give him this without committing him ? He was not looking for appreciation , he was looking for love . " Hue want . " She smiled acquiescently . " Hue want Ann want . " She nodded . Finally he broached the dread notion : " Love . " This was a seldom used , seldom understood concept . It signified the union of those who did it for reasons other than practical , sometimes at great cost . Her eyes grew large . " Love , " she repeated . " Hue Ann ? " " Ann Hue , " he clarified . He wanted to know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hue Ann love ? " She touched her chin . He turned his upper body , caught her elbows , and approached her face . She could turn away if she wished to . She did not . He kissed her projecting chin . Her mouth worked , but she did not speak . Water appeared in her eyes . He lifted his face and brought it close again . This time she moved too , bringing her mouth to meet his . They kissed . In that moment he knew that he could indeed love her , and that she could love him . 102 PIERS ANTHONY  | When he drew away , she remained unmoving . Her eyes lost their focus ; she seemed to be gazing out beyond the shelter , into the sky . " Love day , " she said . " Storm no . " She thought that love could not exist in a circumstance like this . She was afraid it was n't real . She was afraid to believe . But it might be days before the sun shone again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted her to believe now . How could he persuade her ? He thought about it . Then he tried something he had never thought of before . He tried to pretend there was sun . " Ann eyes shut , " he said . " Hue eyes shut . " She glanced at him , then closed her eyes . He did the same . " Think rain no . Think sound water splash . Think day yes . " He had always been good at imagining sounds ; could he enable her to do it too ? " Rain yes , " she said , perplexed . " Rain yes . THINK rain no . Think sun yes . " " Sun yes , " she echoed uncertainly . Carefully he took her through it : instead of being stuck in a leaking shelter in a storm , they were in bright sunshine . They were not alone on the beach , but together with the other members of the tribe . They had an audience for what they were about to do . As he spoke the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did begin to see it . They were still on the beach , but in the brightest day , surrounded by a ring of all the water folk , waiting expectantly . Then he took Ann 's hand . " Hue mate Ann , " he said . " Join tribe . " " Ann mate Hue , " she said , her voice charged with emotion . " Love . " " Love , " he agreed . Then he kissed her . Then they did sex before everyone , the whole tribe being witness . And lay there hugging each other , just sharing the feeling . While the sunshine beat down loudly and steadily all around , and dripped on them . Hue was n't sure how many times the sun shone on their unions , but it was a number . At one point they laughed together , realizing that the sun was shining just as brightly in the middle of the night . But at last they woke to real day , after a night , and the rain was gone . Hue opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to their shelter . What had happened ? They stared out across the lake . There were the shelters , but strangely small . They had been flooded out ! Now they saw the water folk swimming toward the shore . They had heard the sudden silence of the end of the storm , and come out immediately . But it must have been terrible in the shelters . Worse than on the beach . They got the story in scattered bits : The rain had continued unremittingly , and the water had risen . At first the folk had simply drawn their feet SHAME OF MAN 103  | back , having experienced such rises before ; the shelters were made so that some rise could be accommodated . But this rise was worse than any they had ever encountered . The water crept across their sleeping places . At first they had to share the highest ones , but then these too flooded . They dared not let the water touch them long , for fear of the thunder-kill . So they took sticks from the domes and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice . Still the water rose . They had to keep building , until the domes began to collapse because of the weakening of their structure . By dawn their houses had become a cluster of islands , each crowded with shivering people . At last the storm passed . As soon as they thought it was safe , they plunged into the water and swam for shore . Hue recognized Joe and Bil and Itt , Lee and Ember , and many others . They had lost their shelters , but at least there had been no deaths . Now most of them just wanted to find safe places to rest and sleep , for they had managed little of either during the night . Hue exchanged a glance with Ann . They had thought they had been badly off , but they had survived the night in more comfort and a good deal more pleasure than the others had . But something needed to be said . Hue approached Joe . " Hue Ann mate , " he said . Joe , distracted by other concerns , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , and moved on . So much for their fancied public ceremony . They had picked the wrong time . Things were in sad disarray . Many people were badly fatigued from discomfort and fright , and stood somewhat dazedly , not knowing what to do . Some had been injured . One woman was about to birth her baby . And the storm was coming back . Bil approached . " Joe enemy look , " he said . That made sense , as the water folk were highly vulnerable now , being confined to the shore . They would have to hide if there were any enemy tribes raiding . " Bil island lead . " So he knew of a new island the tribe could use for protection and residence ; once he got the water folk there , they could afford to rest . " Hue food move . " Just like that , Hue was working directly for the tribe , with a responsible task . That hippo meat should not be wasted ; they would need it to eat while they built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann know . " Bil looked at Ann . " Peninsula . " He went on , seeing to other business . Ann nodded . " Peninsula low neck , " she said . " Water high , island . " Oh . Of course the water folk knew all the bypaths of the shoreline . They would simply float the carcass to the island . It would be a slow job for one man , but it was important . But as the weary water folk followed Bil along the path around the expanded lake , the storm darkened and the rain resumed . Thunder crashed 104 PIERS ANTHONY  | nearby . Ann cringed , and so did a number of the others . " Go go go ! " Bil cried , not letting them dive for cover . He knew that the thunder would n't hurt them on land , but that enemies could . Their first priority was to get to the new island . Bil was the actual leader of the tribe , Hue realized . Joe was the nominal one , but he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by Bil . It seemed to work well enough , because Bil always made a show of consulting Joe and deferring to his judgment . But now Hue had his own chore to handle . They could n't enter the water while the thunder was threatening , but the hippo carcass was too massive to carry on land . What were they to do ? Hue pondered , and decided that a rope would do it . He foraged for vines , tied them together to make a long rope , tied it to the carcass , and shoved it into the water . Then he walked along the shore , hauling on the vine . It was n't easy , because the carcass tended to snag on things , and there was no path here , but he did make slow progress . The thing also tended to swing back in toward land , until Ann got a long stick and kept shoving it out while Hue pulled . That helped a lot . Ann told him the way , though she ran for the cover of a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she was doing well to restrain her fear enough to guide him . Of course he might be able to find the island by himself , just by following the shoreline far enough , but this way he was able to skip inlets that she knew were wrong . There were streams flowing into the lake , and they had to gamble by forging across these , hoping the thunder would not strike when they were in the water . Ann was terrified , but did it when she had to . He grabbed her , held her , and kissed her , in this way shoring up her courage . It was hard to tell in this unfamiliar terrain , but it seemed to Hue that the water was still rising . Certainly it was n't sinking , because he saw no water marks on the tree trunks above the level of the lake . But there were a number of trees now growing out of the swirling brown water . Late in the day they reached the island . It was hard to believe that it had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land by a fair amount . But its central portion rose well above the lake , so it was in no danger of being flooded out of existence . The rain eased off , and the thunder retreated , so they were able to swim across to the island , dragging the carcass behind . Ann was a real help here , because though she lacked Hue 's strength , she was a much better swimmer . They heaved it onto the shore , and looked around . The island was wooded , though there were no large trees . There was a crude dome shelter at the top of the hill , under which a number of women and children were sleeping . Men were building other domes around it , hauling bundles of sticks in from the mainland , floating theta across the intervening lake . Women were plaiting roof material from prepared brush . SHAME OF MAN 105  | A small sheltered fire was going , and clams were being roasted . The woman had birthed her baby and was nursing it , while her prior child watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be normal for these folk . Overall , the situation was looking good . Soon men came to work on the hippo carcass . They were smiling ; there would be a good meal tonight . Bil came down to them . " Hue Ann shelter , " he said , pointing to a small open-sided dome . " Do . " " Work much , " Hue said , looking around . " Hue Ann help . " He was tired from his labor of the day , but much remained to be done . " Shelter , " Bil repeated firmly , seeming amused . Ann caught Hue 's hand and drew him toward the shelter . Then he understood : their mating . It was time to clarify it for the tribe . Then there would be no question . They went to the shelter . They sat under it , and Ann brushed back her long dark hair and smiled at him , and he wondered that he could ever have thought her to be odd in appearance . Now her bare skin and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction . After all , her face was small , and needed that extra brace of bone to keep it firm . Her broad hips were so she could birth a bigheaded baby . Everything made sense , and he was acquiring a taste for it . He kissed her , and then lay with her , and it was wonderful to be close to her . The initial urgency of sex had been abated during the prior day and night , so there was no hurry , and he enjoyed it perhaps more . At length it was finished , and they separated and sat up . The rest of the tribe was seated in a circle , watching , smiling . Lee was there , and she did not look jealous , while beside her Ember looked amused . This was their entertainment for a day that had not had much else to recommend it . Then , having seen that the couple had seen them seeing , they got up and returned to their various endeavors . And Hue and Ann returned to theirs : hauling bundles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There needed to be shelter for all by nightfall , for the rain was coming back once more . The fire increased , and the smell of meat spread . They went for their meal , and Hue realized that it was their first of the day . They had been so busy that they had never paused to eat  --  and there had n't been much food available anyway . He saw Ember carrying wood ; she was as usual delighted to be able to help tend the fire . And there was Lee , carving out portions of hippo for the others with her uninjured arm and hand . She worked beside Vik , and there was something about the way the two related to each other that suggested that another couple was forming 106 PIERS ANTHONY  | The rain continued intermittently for several more days , gradually easing . But the lake continued to rise even when the sun was shining . The island grew smaller , but the center was high enough so that it could not be overwhelmed . Hue realized that Bil had required the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rising water would not wash them out either . The island had become their shelter base , and if the water rose enough , they would be as before , with only the tops of the domes showing above the surface . The neighboring enemy tribes did not attack . In fact there was little sign of them anywhere in the area . This was suspicious , and finally Bil decided to investigate it . Bil always anticipated problems , and tried to prepare for them in advance . Thus he had known where the tribe could be safe , if the waters rose ; there had been no hesitation when he took them to the new island . Now he was concerned . So Joe , Bil , and Hue left their women behind and went to where the nearest enemy tribe lived . It was a sunny day , so they were able to use the water when they got close , silently wading or swimming . They had reeds to breathe through , in case they needed to submerge . Hue knew that their pace was slower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew more about the hairy folk , being one himself . He might recognize some aspect that the full water folk would not . The region was strangely quiet . No raiders were out foraging near the shore . Of course they normally foraged away from the water ; still , it was odd that there were none by the lake . But there was a fire some distance back from the shore . That would mark their camp . The three moved quietly toward that fire , alert for enemies , for this was approaching the heart of raider territory . It was extremely unusual to have so little activity here . There did not even seem to be guard patrols . Finally they came to the fire itself , peering cautiously out of the shelter of thick brush . And were amazed . The fire was in a glade , and the glade was filled with hairy raiders . Most of them were lying on the ground . A few were afoot , but even those ones did not look lively . What were they doing ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was why there had been no raids since the flood . Some terrible illness had come upon the raiders , and was wiping them out . They retreated as quietly as they had come . But once they were away from the camp , they used land trails to return to the island . It was obvious that there would be no pursuit , no ambush party . The raiders had trouble of their own . But Hue was worried . " Sickness  --  sometimes , " 1w said , straining to remember what he had heard about it . " People ( lie . Some live . Many no . All tribes . " He had no idea why this happened , lust that it did , every so often . SHAME OF MAN 107  | Joe shook his head . " Water folk sickness no , " he said , and Bil agreed . Mass dyings were unknown among them . None of them could fathom why this should be so . But it was . No sickness came to the water folk . The water continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to supervise changes in their activity to keep their supplies secure . But they were safe there  --  and on the shore too , for there were now too few raiders to raid . They made their traps by the new shoreline , but never needed to use them . They began to expand their hunting and foraging territory beyond the lake , because the protection of the water was no longer critical . They accepted the new and better order . Perhaps only Bil and Hue wondered why the lake had grown , and why the illness had so weakened the raiders . The others simply accepted it as the destiny of their kind , which was obviously the best fitted to survive and prosper . And prosper they did , expanding in the course of thousands of years out from the fringe of Lake Victoria until they had taken over all of Africa , and then the rest of the world . But why did fate take such a turn , so that one of the seemingly weakest subgroups of mankind came to dominate and replace all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lake expanded because one of the frequent earthquakes caused a landslide that blocked the lake 's northern drainage  --  today known as the river Nile . When heavy rains came , the lake filled , and this continued when the rains stopped because of the drainage into the lake from the entire area . Thus the territory of the land dwellers was flooded and diminished , while that of the water dwellers was increased . In time the river cut a new channel , and the lake drained and dwindled , but by then the balance had shifted , and the water folk were numerous and powerful , while the land folk were less populous and not well organized . What happened to the Home erectus tribes ? Perhaps fleas . Erect man was thickly furred , which meant he had fleas , impossible to obliterate . On occasion the fleas carried disease , and thus spread plague . The only people free of this liability were those who did not have fleas : the hairless ones . Modern man . Of course we Moderns do have body hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do look bare , and fleas can not survive on us . Hairlessness was originally an adaptation for the water , but it turned out to have survival value on the land too . On occasion Modern man did live in such dense communities , using clothing never changed or cleaned , and associated so closely with animals , that fleas could attack him , and so the pattern of plagues returned . The plagues of medieval times suggest what Erect man suffered in earlier millennia . But that later time there was no variant species waiting to take over , and mankind survived , pretty much by chance . The original change probably did not happen in just one siege ; it may have taken tens of thousands of years for repeated sieges to weaken Erect man so that Modern man was able to displace him . The 108 PIERS ANTHONY  | flooding of the Lake Victoria basin could have caused disruption as tribes were driven back , crowding them into smaller territories and making them more vulnerable to flea infestations and disease . Some survivors might have mated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann , but most furred tribes would have become slowly extinct . First in Africa , then in Eurasia , as the Moderns became overwhelmingly numerous . There was another aspect of the change in woman 's body . Her great amount of time in the water made odor a poor sexual signal , so the emphasis became visual instead of olfactory . Her breasts became high and full , to be seen and used when she was chest deep in the water . With mankind 's increasing intelligence came his awareness of the connection between sex and babies , and neither man nor woman always wishes to have babies . Thus nature conspired to conceal the woman 's key time , so that it was never possible to be sure when she could conceive . The fact that a woman 's breasts no longer shrank when she was fertile meant that she was continuously alluring and , as far as vision went , continuously impregnable . The risk of conception could not be avoided , if there were sexual activity . This led to chronic population pressure , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breasts seem to be modified sweat glands , and sweating is something that only mankind and horses do for cooling  --  a dangerous mechanism , unless replacement water is freely available . But effective , enabling mankind to handle hotter climate , and to exercise longer without overheating . This was another powerful mechanism for survival , thanks to water . The retention of pubic hair is more difficult to explain . Why did all the rest of the body go bare except parts of the head and the pubic region ? The head needed hair to protect the valuable brain , and the hair on the face differentiated the males from the females . But both sexes grow pubic hair at maturity , and it really is n't needed to differentiate that section of the body . Hair can help spread odor , and this may be the case with genital hair , but could hardly have done so when women spent much of their time waist deep in water . Yet nature does not do things without reason . There had to be a survival advantage for genital hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the male 's sperm cells are activated and possibly vulnerable to mutation or damage by temperature or the penetrating radiation of the sun . It may not be coincidence that only the brain and genitals remain protected by fur . Modern mankind 's head had modified . As his mouth and jaws got smaller and more nearly square , structural strength was lost , and some additional buttress was needed . Thus extra bone at the chin helped survival . The skull , too , changed shape . Modern man did not necessarily have more brain tissue than Erect man , but its distribution differed . This may have been because mankind 's adaptation to life in the water , while not entirely leaving the land , required additional mental processes . People had to learn how to use the knowledge and reflexes developed /or survival on the land to . survive in water . This dual SHAME OF MAN 109  | ability may seem elementary to us  --  but we represent the end result . It surely was not at first simple for mankind , who had evolved almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prior brain tissue at the rear of the brain faded in importance , and new tissue was added at the front . This is surely an oversimplification , but it may be that comprehensive memory gave way to better analytical ability . That turned out , later , to be a critical shift . Modern mankind not only looked different , he thought differently . And , lest there be any confusion : though Ann may have looked odd to Erect Man , because of her swollen breasts , small waist , broad pelvis , thick thighs , furlessness , and even to her own tribes people because of her bony chin , she represents physically the final human form . Today we appreciate breasted women , and males too have chin braces . For our tastes , she would appear to be absolutely lovely . She just might be the species template , Eve of Eden , the ancestor of all mankind today .  | Mankind was physically modern when he emerged from the water to reconquer the land , but not yet mentally modern . One of the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . During the prior hundred thousand years or so mankind shared the world with other variants of Erect man , such as Archaic man in Asia and Neanderthal man in Europe , and his life-style seemed similar . Then abruptly he made dramatic advances in organization , technology , language , and all the arts , and took over the world . The prior Geodyssey volume , Isle of Woman , assumes that when a group of children were raised together , instead of individually by their mothers , they learned a new 112 PIERS ANTHONY  | way of organizing their vocabulary , using superior syntax , and actually changed the organization of their brains in the process . Thus the origin of mankind 's modern mind may have been in the Levant . That may be so , but this sequel volume assumes that it was more complicated than that , and developed more slowly in another region : Eden , or the Lake Victoria basin . That the intellectual breakthrough derives from the same place as the physical one , and followed naturally from it . That we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one-time adaptation to life in the water . And to our dreams . But to clarify this , we need to examine the nature of modern thinking and dreaming and memory . Much is not what it seems . The setting this time is not Eden , however . It is near the confluence of the Mountain Nile and the White Nile rivers in modern-day Sudan , about 600 miles north of Lake Victoria . The time is about 60,000 years ago . Because if this supposition is correct , the delay in the advance of modern mankind across Eurasia was not because of the resistance of Archaic man or Neandertal man , but because the giant Sahara Desert of Africa prevented the new thinking from reaching the fringe . Only very slowly could modern-minded man penetrate that vast hostile barrier , following the thin avenue of the great river where hunting and foraging remained good . It was slow because of the hostile primitive-mind modern-body tribes settled along that avenue ; they would not let strangers by without trouble , and the terrain did not allow large-scale migration or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquer the world may not have been enough for very small groups to prevail against set , conservative primitive cultures . Intruders had to accommodate themselves in whatever way they could , and most may have died . But some may have been lucky , and achieved a foothold . Only when their numbers increased in the world beyond the Sahara so that they could form complete communities , did the apparent transformation occur . HUGH walked beside the river , reflecting on his situation as he watched for suitable prey to hunt . He realized now that Bub had done it . Bub had wanted Hugh to join his tribe , and take Bub 's sister Sis as a mate , but Hugh had declined and married Anne instead . So Bub had bided his time , then struck . He had been maliciously cunning , waiting until a bad storm had destroyed much of the encampment and killed several people . Then he had told Chief Joe that this was the punishment of the spirits , because the tribe harbored one who was not properly a man . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the word of an outsider whose tribe was at times hostile , but it was a time of stress , and Bub offered to bring his tribe to join in a larger hunt that would bring in enough meat to support both tribes until the situation recovered . Bi1 had not liked it , but had recognized that a joint hunt would indeed be mutually profitabl , it made sense . So he and SHAME OF MAN 113  | Joe considered it , while the privation continued and the people grew leaner . Bub refused to hunt with Hue , because of that bad hand . Bub 's well-formed sister circulated , having private liaisons with men , and in her wake the hostility to wrong-sidedness grew . Hue came to understand , belatedly , that he had angered Sis by his refusal to marry her , and though men governed the tribes , the mischief of a woman disdained could be formidable . No one before had remarked upon Hugh 's preferred use of his left hand to wield his axe . Now the attention of the tribe focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was indeed the malice of the spirits . Hugh was one of the leaders of the tribe , but his position eroded , and soon he was unwelcome . Anne supported him , refusing to desert him for another man , though she used her right hand . Thus she too became suspect . Indeed , she had suffered a difficult childbearing , almost dying ; now this too was brought forth as evidence of the mischief of bearing the baby of a cursed man . She had recovered and was now fully healthy , but the shadow remained . " It is n't that we think you are bad , " Joe explained , embarrassed . " But we dare not go against the spirits . If they strike again ... " That hardly mattered now . Hugh and Anne had had to leave with their baby son Chip , exiled . Anne had been devastated by the thought of leaving her tribe , but then had rallied and realized that she no longer needed the tribe , now that she had a family . They had fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction that offered some hope of forage . There were always fish in the river , and if there were also more formidable creatures , these could be avoided . The plants by the riverside were lush , and of course there was always good water to drink . And there were inevitably people , eventually , for others also appreciated the advantages of water . Unfortunately people represented one of the greatest dangers , because many tribes simply killed any strangers who intruded on their territories . So Hugh looked as carefully for signs of people as for animals and plants . He wanted to spy before being spied on . His life could depend on it . The vegetation became tangled , and the water crossed rapids , which would be dangerous to enter , so he moved out somewhat , rounding the curve of a hilly slope . Then he stopped , because he heard something ahead . He remained quite still for a moment , holding his breath , orienting on the mound . Then he moved quietly behind a tree : one that would be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreating . Whatever it was was moving away . Therefore it represented no immediate threat . It was probably some kind of antelope , a ! rest , too big and fast for a man alone to hunt . Hugh relaxed . There were many such Use alarms in the course of an exploration or hunt , 114 PIERS ANTHONY  | and each had to be taken seriously , because any one of them just might turn out to be lethally true . By the time he skirted the thicket crowding the river he was in a ravine leading away from both the river and his camp . He picked his way to the clearest avenue to get back on course , climbing a steep slope . It was as if the animal had led him astray , or perhaps driven him off his original path . Or as if he were fleeing some horror of the valley , ascending the mountain , looking for food and safety . As indeed he was , in a larger sense . He crested the rim of the ravine , and spied a rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axe , conscious now as not before that it was his left hand that held it . But as he drew back his arm to throw , the rabbit bounded away . He followed it , mildly annoyed that he had not been alert for this . He should have crested the rim with his weapon ready to throw , and knocked off the rabbit the instant he saw it . But this was new terrain to him , and he did n't yet know the rabbit trails . One thing the episode demonstrated : rabbits in this region were not used to being hunted by man . That suggested that this would be a good place to remain for a while . He pursued the rabbit , carefully , also watching for other creatures . How many men had been led to their deaths by focusing too narrowly on a hunt when in strange terrain ? He could not afford to come to mischief , because Anne depended on him . She was more than competent , but she had their baby to care for , and needed his support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight . Hugh heaved his axe . The rabbit heard it coming and tried to jump out of the way , but the blade caught it flatside and knocked it unconscious . He closed on it immediately , picked it up , and checked : it was dead . Good enough . Now he could return to camp . He put the rabbit in his game pouch , wiped off his axe , and angled for the river , whose voice he could hear not far distant . But as he crested another ridge he saw a distant plume of smoke . He stopped again , orienting on it much as he had on the animal sound . How far was it , and how big ? Was it a distant volcano , or a near camp fire ? Or an intermediate brush fire ? All three were dangerous in their own ways . But as a general rule , the farther away it was , the safer it was . He concluded that it was an intermediate fire , not big enough for brush , so probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he would avoid that until he had no choice . When he encountered the people of this region  --  and the fire made it clear that they existed  --  he wanted to do so in a planned manner , with a good escape route planned . But he might be able to avoid such contact for some time , since they evidently did n't often hunt here . Now that he knew where they were . Hugh resumed his quest for the river . He saw movement in the thicket . I n a moment he identified it as a monkey . He could probably strike it with his SHAME OF MAN 115  | axe , as it was regarding him curiously from what it thought was a safely high vantage . Monkeys , too , had not been hunted here recently . But he already had his kill , and there was something about its almost manlike aspect that made him disinclined to hurt it anyway . Monkeys were not men , yet they were not really far different from men , and the similarity bothered him a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as foolish , but it remained . He would not kill a monkey unless he had to . He moved on , and soon saw the river , or rather the spray of water and mist it threw up at the foot of its rapids . As he come closer he felt the fringe of that spray like a light rain on his face , hands , and arms . He saw that the lay of the land was such that he would do better to cross to the other side of the river here rather than farther down where it might be deeper ; there were rocky shallows here that he could navigate readily enough , with several channels running between them . He made his way down to the water . There was motion on the near bank . Hugh stood still , his arm cocked , his eyes searching . It was a little crocodile , harmless and shy as far as he was concerned , though dangerous to smaller creatures . This was another creature he could have killed for food , if he had not already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . He used his axe to cut a sapling for a staff and made his way across the river , carefully , checking each rock before trusting his weight to it . He jumped across the surging channels after poking the landing sites with the end of his staff . It was n't just firmness he checked for , but to make sure there were no bad snakes or bugs by them . One bad sting on a foot could be much mischief . He got soaked by the spume , at times plowing a seeming rainstorm , but that was the way of such things . He completed his crossing , then paused to sniff the air . There was something . He searched the bank , checking every tree , sniffing repeatedly until he had it . " Anne , " he said , facing the right tree . She stepped out from behind it , the loveliest creature he knew . She was naked , with her dark hair swirling down around her very full bosom . " You took long enough to spot me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could have attacked you . " " Men are n't in this region , " he replied , advancing on her . " Except farther downriver where there 's a camp . " She came to meet him , walking in the manner only she could . " Let me wash you , " she said . I he let her strip away his loin-fur and pouch and set them on the ground . Then she led him back to the nearest thick spray-channel . It was a narrow one , with the water throwing up a constant barrage of drops and splash . Sunlight slanted through the vapor , making circular rainbows . 116 PIERS ANTHONY  | She stepped halfway across the channel and stood with her legs spread above the surging flow , one foot on each side . " Come to me , my ardent man , " she said , smiling . " Are you not concerned that I am wrong-handed ? " he asked her , making a joke of what had become most serious . " That the spirits will strike you down for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was virtually outcast myself , before you came and found me beautiful . If that was the mischief of the spirits , then I have no fear of them . " She smiled again , spreading her arms and breathing deeply , inviting him with all her body . She was more than beautiful , with her swirling hair and phenomenally full breasts and sleek body and limbs . How could he resist ? He straddled the cleft of the river , facing her , feeling the water striking his legs and crotch . He moved forward to embrace her , bending his knees just enough to get his eager member into place . Her thighs were slippery wet ; he slid in readily , and climaxed immediately , while she held him close and rubbed his back with flying river water . It was as if the entire river were flowing through him and into her , providing a force and ecstasy he could hardly remember experiencing before . She kissed him , her lips smiling against his . The rapture continued after his body was spent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wetness of it all . What did all else matter , with her here with him like this ? Eventually she whispered in his ear . " I would like this forever , my love , but my baby soon will wake , and I must feed him before he cries . " Of course she was right . " I will finish my exploration and join you , " he said . He rubbed a hand across her slick bottom , then drew away enough to stroke a slick breast . " But we must do this again , soon . " " Soon , " she agreed . Then she stepped off the channel and shook herself dry as she walked , in this manner holding his attention yet longer . She recovered her own fur and donned it , took his rabbit pouch , and walked into the forest beside the river , going upstream toward their hidden camp . " Soon , " he echoed , feeling his member hardening again already with the memory of the experience . What a way to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . What a woman she was ! Hugh went to dress , then walked on downstream . He wanted to see whether there were any trails or other signs of human presence in this vicinity . The fire had been close enough so that this should be in the local tribe 's normal hunting range , unless it was a temporary outpost for a more distant settlement . If they did n't hunt here , why did n't they ? There had to be good reason . He needed to know this before he and Anne spent another night here . He found a trail , but not human . This was hyena spoor . Hyenas were dangerous , but seldom attacked men unless really hungry . The presence of ' hyenas should not he enough to deter human hunters . Hugh 's hone tribe had driven the hyenas to the fringe of their territory .. Hyenas were smart SHAME OF MAN 117 enough to know when they were overmatched , as they were by an organized human hunting party . So this simply was another evidence that the tribe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anything bad enough to deter human hunters should also scare away hyenas . The mystery deepened . He followed the hyena path , knowing that any of the big creatures near enough to smell him or hear him would move away . A wounded or sick man they might gang up on and attack , but he was neither . A group of them could overcome a single man like him , but they did n't know that . And any who did attack a human being were apt to find themselves relentlessly hunted until all were dead or fled from their territory . They would n't know that Hugh was out of his territory and therefore vulnerable . So he acted with boldness , knowing that the animals would respect that . But when he rejoined Anne , he would warn her . If she left the baby in a place a hyena could reach .. . Then he heard something that made him pause . It sounded like the cry of a baby . Perhaps he had imagined it , because he had been thinking about his own baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure . It was the thin wail of a newborn human infant . But there was no soothing murmur of the mother 's voice . It was n't his own baby Chip ; Anne would never leave him in a place like this , and he knew his own son 's cry . This was another baby , and by the sound of it , alone . What could a baby be doing by a hyena trail ? Hugh moved on , doubly alert for human presence , but could detect none . No sound , no smell , no traces . Just the baby . There was light ahead . He left the trail and moved silently toward the light , for that was where the sounds were coming from . He made his way carefully through the thickening foliage near the light . He peered beyond it The forest opened into a glade . In the center of the glade was a cleared face of stone . On the stone lay a tiny baby swathed in a worn dirty fur wrapping . There was the faint smell of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was all . Perplexed , Hugh studied the fringe of the glade . He saw a path entering the forest on the far side . That could have been where the mother had walked , bringing the baby . But she had to know that it was n't safe here . Where had she gone ? Then he got a faint whiff of old carrion . Something had died here , some time ago . It could be the remnant of one of the hyena 's kills . He sniffed , locating it . He saw a small bone . A human bone . Then he knew . This was the tribe 's abandoning ground . Where unwanted babies were left to die . That explained why hunters avoided this region . they did not like to think about what was here . People had spirits , and babies had them too , and the spirits did not look kindly on those who killed 118 PIERS ANTHONY  | their bodies . So women would come here , leave their babies , and hurry away , and no one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire region , because it was not known how far spirits ranged . Any hunters who came too close could be attacked by the spirits and suffer injury . It would be made to seem that the injury was accidental , for the spirits arranged other causes for their malice , but no one was fooled . Bad fortune was sure to come to those who exposed themselves to it by coming here . And Hugh had walked right into it . Now the spirits would be after him . Indeed , they might already be gathering , planning his accident . They would attack Anne , too , and Chip . No , not Chip , because he was a baby himself , one of them . But he would die when Hugh and Anne died . Spirits did n't necessarily distinguish between the living folk ; they struck at any people who tarried in their domain . Maybe their urge for vengeance was so strong that they did n't care about individual guilt ; any living person was considered culpable . Maybe his wrong-handedness made it worse . Could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and his family were doomed . But there might be a way to fool them . Hugh was a hunter , but they might take him for a mother if he picked up this abandoned baby . If they killed or hurt the mother of a baby , so that the baby was left without a protector and died , they would be guilty of what they punished others for . So they normally did n't go after mothers with babies . So he had been wrong to assume that Anne would be attacked ; she should be protected by her baby . Hugh needed protection too . He entered the glade and picked up the baby , using both hands . It was female and seemed healthy . He wrapped the hide blanket about her more closely , put the bundle in the crook of his arm , and hurried back down the hyena trail . He would rejoin Anne , and they would flee this region before nightfall , getting clear of the spirits . Protected by their babies . But when he came to their camp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't happen that way . Anne looked up and instantly recognized the nature of his bundle . " Where did you get that baby ? " she demanded , amazed , as she set Chip down . " This is the place of abandonment , " he explained . " They are left out for the hyenas . We have to ? " " A girl , " she said , taking the baby from his rigidly folded arm . " What are we going to do with a baby girl ? " " Protection , " he said . " The spirits wo n't attack us if she 's with us . We can flee this region now . " She looked sharply at him . " And what then ? " He was blank . " Then ? " " Once we get free of this region , what about this baby ? " He had n't thought of that . " Maybe leave her somewhere else , and move swiftly away front there . " " And the tribe who left this baby  --  what of them ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go away from them , because they wo n't like our interference here . " " Back up the river , the way we came ? " " No , we ca n't go back . To the side , perhaps . " " Where there is no river . No water . No easy path to follow . " She was right . This was a worse situation than he had realized . " But we ca n't stay here , " he argued . " With the baby , maybe we can . She will protect us here , as long as she lives . " " But she wo n't live long . She was abandoned . " " Unless we make her live . " " But we ca n't ? " Then he understood her meaning . " But can you save her ? " Anne shrugged . " I have two breasts . " She brought the baby to one of them . Hugh realized it was possible . Chip had grown well on her full breasts , and was almost ready to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There might be enough for the foundling girl . He watched the baby starting to nurse . He knew that sometimes babies could n't survive with other mothers , but sometimes they could . So perhaps the problem of the spirits had been forestalled , for now . But not the problem of getting past what could be a hostile foreign tribe  --  with one of its abandoned babies . What protected them from the spirits might put them into worse jeopardy with the tribe . Unless they could get beyond its territory without being discovered . " Maybe if we travel at night , and hide by day ? " " No . We need to hunt and forage . I must eat well , and rest well , to keep up with two . We ca n't travel and hide . " " But what are we to do ? " he asked plaintively , horrified by this disaster . " We will stay here , " she said firmly . " But ? " " Who is going to bother us ? " she asked . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so would the tribesmen . They could stay right here , for a time . Except for one thing . " If the spirits discover my ? " He paused , hesitating to say it , lest the spirits be listening . But his glance flocked to his left side . " Surely they know already , " she said . " Did n't they see you hunting ? Maybe they consider you their friend . " Hugh was astonished . What she said made sense . The spirits would have seen him hunting , and they had left him alone . Perhaps they had even led him to the baby , testing him . When he had taken it instead of leaving it , the spirits could have known that he was their friend . And if that was the way of it , yes , he would be their friend . 120 PIERS ANTHONY  | " Make a fire , " she said . " This baby needs more warmth than I can give her . " " But that will signal our presence to the tribe , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter , because the tribesmen would not risk the wrath of the spirits . They would think it was a ghost fire , intended to lure them in for punishment . How neatly Anne had figured it ! He gathered tinder and brought out his little spark stones . In due course he had a fire . Anne sat beside it with a baby held on each arm , letting them nurse on either side as they wished . " Shall we call her Mina ? " she asked . Hugh was not ready to argue anything with her at this point . " Yes . " He set up the rabbit for roasting . So it was as the evening progressed . Mina did well enough , seeming to have no trouble with Anne 's milk , and Anne knew very well how to care for a baby . Gaining confidence in the protection of the spirits , who were now perhaps their friends instead of their enemies , Hugh went about the business of making a competent shelter for the night . As darkness closed , they entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance , giving off just enough smoke to discourage insects and predators . They lay on a bed of fir boughs with the two babies between them , covered by warm fur blankets . The soft boughs were over sand that would absorb the babies ' urine , keeping them reasonably dry . It was Mina 's fortune that Anne was a practiced mother , well able to care for an extra baby , if her milk held out . Hugh slept , secure in the knowledge that the spirits would protect them all from the tribesmen , and the babies would protect the adults from the spirits , and Anne would take care of the babies . Daytime might be a different challenge , but the night was secure . His dreams were scattered and not really comprehensible . In some he seemed to be furred like an animal ; in others he mated with strange women and hardly noticed . His hands did not seem to matter ; he used one or the other without preference . Sometimes he walked with his hands as well as his feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dream this seemed natural . Sometimes he swung up into the trees with a facility that would have amazed him had he been awake . The dream did not care ; it was just there . Whenever a thread of a coherent episode occurred , it broke off and something else formed . It was as if his wandering consciousness was not concerned whether he understood or remembered ; the fragments were sufficient to themselves . Yet he tried to understand and to remember , suspecting that there was some vast importance that he was not quite grasping . SHAME OF MAN 121  | He walked through the forest . He heard something . He paused , orienting on it . Was it predator , prey , or acquaintance ? It was a huge gorilla , stomping toward Hugh 's home . It growled and swung its monstrous hairy arms , and Hugh had to flee . Then all of his people were fleeing up a steep slope , women and children too . The apes had displaced them , and they had to find new territory . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with steam issuing from vents . He had a little sister whom he protected , but at the moment he could not remember her name . They found more good trees on the other side , and moved into them . Life became much as it had been before , except that they foraged more frequently on the ground . Then a foreign man came and took his mother . Hugh and his sister fled again , along with their friends . It was another exodus . They formed a band of their own . They fought someone . There were no trees , so they had to go on their feet all the time . They grabbed sticks and rocks to fight with . There was the cry of a baby . Hugh remembered he had mated and there was a baby . But his mate took care of it . He was walking again . A rabbit bounded away . He chased it , but it became large , a beest , and they were all chasing it for an interminable time . Finally it led them into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Hugh found a new mate , and clasped her and penetrated her with sudden surprising joy . He saw smoke . Was it a human campsite ? He hefted his axe , which he had learned to throw , but discovered that it was useless . The smoke was from a mountain vomiting , spewing out monstrous roiling clouds , glowing rocks , and a red river that burned everything it touched . He and the others had to flee it and hide in a cave until the mountain 's rage abated . He was with his new mate , but then he was mating with someone else , a woman he did n't like , and his own mate was mating with a man he did n't like . Somehow this enabled them to escape the fire mountain , and when they did escape it , they separated . He saw a monkey in a tree . He approached it , and the closer he got , the larger it became , until it was an ape twice his own height . But he was n't afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed almost friendly . Almost like a man . But then others wanted to hunt it , to hurt it , and he could n't stop them . They did n't understand his reticence . Even his mate seemed disgusted with him . She looked at his left hand , and then they all were looking at it , and he realized that their unease with his difference was increasing , now that he was acting contrary to their wishes . So he left her and his tribe and walked alone again , except for a girl-child who came with him . They passed a mountain , and fell , and then came to water . There were people there , odd ones , but he lived among them and learned their ways of the water . Hunting in water was like hunting on land , only different ; he had to strain to discover the ways in which the disciplines 122 PIERS ANTHONY  | were similar , because it was better to adapt what he knew than to learn from the beginning . A croc attacked , and he fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected came to him , and became beautiful , and it was An , or Ann , no , Anne , and he mated with her and liked her , and it was much better than what had been before . In fact the prior dreams were already fading , and this was the only reality he knew . He was with Anne , loving her , feeling emotion he had not known before . He saw a baby lying in a glade . There were spirits around , threatening him , so he took the baby and held the spirits at bay . He brought it home to Anne , so there were two babies . The babies grew , and more babies came , until there were children all around . Anne nursed them , and sang to them , and taught them to speak , and danced for them , and they learned well . They liked singing and dancing and drawing , and that showed that they were real people instead of primitives . Hugh took them hunting , as they got older , and they learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tribe Hugh and Anne had left , not that of the tribe they had come from . They learned to chip stone well instead of clumsily , and they were intelligent instead of ignorant . One of them was like him , in appearance and manner , using his left hand . Sometimes the others looked askance at that one , but he was good in the things he did , so they did not object . In time there were so many of them that they became a tribe of their own , and Hugh and Anne were honored elders . They crowded the primitive tribe , expanding their hunting and foraging territory . But they did not mate among themselves ; instead they went out and took mates from the fading other tribe , and brought in those men and women , and tried to teach them the ways of better speaking and organizing . In this they were really not successful , but their children had no trouble learning the good ways . Some went out to other lands , where they found their own places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to be like their adoptive families instead of like those who had abandoned them . In this manner the spirits saved many children , and conquered the world . Not with any invasion , slaughter , or force , but simply by blessing their children with superior ways . Whole subtribes grew up , honoring the spirits . They spread everywhere , displacing the primitives , and everything was wonderful . Hugh woke . Anne was nursing Mina and stroking Chip 's head , keeping him calm . All seemed to be well . He got up to tend the fire , which was down to warm ashes . Already the dream was fading , leaving only weird fragments . But that was the way of dreams . They could be interesting and strange , but probably SHAME OF MAN 123  | meant only that the spirits were mischievously toying with the minds of the sleepers . If this meant that the spirits had no animosity for Hugh and Anne , as long as they took care of the babies , this was good . This was excellent hunting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising the children they acquired , teaching them the proper ways , just as the dream foretold . It seems that primitive or cold-bodied creatures do n't dream . When they sleep , if they need to , their brains shut down as well as their bodies . But warm-bodied creatures , notably the mammals , do dream . Why ? Nature does not institute such procedures without reason . That reason is straightforward , though as yet generally unrecognized in science : the dreams represent important work being done . They relate to memory : a person deprived of dreaming suffers in the formation and retention of new memories . Consider the situation : All day most creatures are active , hunting , foraging , feeding , mating , surviving . Life experience pours in pretty much randomly . Some are important , such as which berries induce vomiting or which bugs sting ; such information needs to be recorded and made available for retrieval . Some are not important , such as how many times the third mouthful of food was chewed or the color of the wings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 . Impressions have to be culled , lest what is important be buried under trivia . But it is not convenient to do this at the time ; full attention needs to be available to the process of living , however tedious . Absent-mindedness on the hunt can be deadly . So the impressions are stored temporarily until they can be properly sorted . Unlike cold-bodied creatures , warm-bodied creatures have a brain that is fully functional at night . This is its downtime : when new impressions are not pouring randomly in . So this is the time when those accumulating temporary memories are processed . The precise process is as yet not understood , but in essence those impressions are brought up into consciousness , considered , culled , crossreferenced , and filed as more permanent memories . Cross-referencing is vital , because this is the mechanism for recall at need . When a berry is seen , the associations relating to berries are traced , and the danger of some berries is recalled . But it may be that black stain is required to mark an item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traced , and the poisonous black berries are recalled : a convenient source for this purpose . Or it is necessary to describe a particular insect , whose size is about that of this berry , a useful comparison . It is not possible to know in advance exactly what connection will contribute to future survival , so all discernible attributes are referenced . It may be necessary to inspect the memory of tasting that berry from many angles , to do the job thoroughly , and it requires consciousness to make decisions as to what is relevant . So the whole experience of the berry is reviewed , and of the stinging bug , and of everything else in the recent ( lay . It may be that the key to cross-referencing is not objective assessment of the qualities of experience , but relates to feeling about it . In the absence of the 124 PIERS ANTHONY  | waking censor  --  the conscious critical facility of the mind  --  this feeling can get out of bounds and bring on a nightmare . But it may be necessary ; fear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is important to have related memories clear . This process of summoning and reviewing may be the essence of what we call dreams . It is not necessary to remember this process ; indeed , the process itself should be forgotten , or it , too , would become experience requiring processing , in an endless recursive sequence . So only dream fragments are remembered , as the waking mind tries to make sense of what are essentially random bits of experience and emotion . But the job , itself forgotten , is done , and key memories are strengthened and defined . The process of dreaming , if not our memory of the dreams themselves , is vital to our mental health . Animals have relatively simple minds , compared to men . When anatomically modern human beings made the breakthrough to mentally modern status , between 40,000 and 100,000 years ago , their comprehension of the world and of their own society and capacities increased enormously . This meant that there was that much more information to process during the dream state . Thus dreams surely became more sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a job that other creatures could not , literally , even dream of . Modern man is a dreamer  --  and thus , paradoxically , more practical and realistic than other creatures . What was the breakthrough that gave the Moderns such power as to conquer the world ? How did it come about ? This is perhaps the greatest untold story of mankind 's history . The development of language with sophisticated syntax enabled man to communicate in far more effective manner . This facilitated his understanding of the world and increased his power to handle it , using complex symbolism that enabled him in due course to develop nuclear power and intricate computers , and to appreciate the arts also . That breakthrough , once made , could have spread slowly out from its origin in Eden , going first to the children , as shown in this chapter . That would account for a mental transformation that did not affect the genes : the existing people acquired new minds , quietly , tribe by tribe as those with such minds trained their children . Perhaps it seems incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But consider what is happening today , in America , where children exposed to the violence and short attention span of television programming grow up to form the most violent and rootless society of the world  --  without their parents fathoming why . As the twig of the young mind is bent , so the tree of the adult is inclined , on a massive scale . What was this mental change ? Why did it prove to be beyond the capacity of Archaic or Neandertal man ? This may be associative thinking . When one segment of Homo erectus entered the shallows of Lake Victoria and lost his body fur , he had to learn how to forage and hunt and sleep in the water , without sacrificing his abilities to do the same on land . He required a double set of reactions . He developed this by adapting : the ways of the land , developed over the course of millions of years , translated to the similar yet hardly identical ways of the water . This was a . shortcut , far /aster Own starting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he thus learned not only to survive in water , but the art of associative thinking . When he left the water to reconquer the land this mental facility was available for other purposes . Such as adapting the extensive vocabulary of anatomically modern man to new purposes , shifting the usage of words to apply not to the foreign medium of water , but to the foreign concepts of past , present , future , and supposition . Modern man learned " maybe " : the tool of imagination itself What was the key to this shift , that made it a survival quality ? It may have been the development of self-consciousness . Ordinary consciousness is a remarkable quality that sets the animal kingdom apart from the plant kingdom . With consciousness , a creature can make choices , thus adapting his limited brain to many situations , instead of having to have every possible thing hard-wired . This is an advantage that enables conscious creatures to prevail when they otherwise might not seem well equipped for survival . Self-consciousness is another level , one that only mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps had it to a degree , but he had diverged before the full effect of the water phase was felt , so was more limited in this seemingly incidental respect . It might seem to be no particular advantage , except for the chain of other things it leads to . High-level self-consciousness is probably what set the Moderns apart from the Archaics , and led them ultimately to dominance . Associative thinking may have given man the capacity to appreciate more than the ordinary ongoing present tense of the animals . It may have been a mental tool , developed for one purpose , then applied to other purposes . It enabled him to ponder other realities : not merely land versus water , but today versus yesterday . How might things have been , had he taken another path and not trodden on that poisonous snake ? He became conscious of time and choice . His language expanded to address such concepts . The connections between language and world view are substantial . When children learn such language , they learn the concepts too , and their understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been slow . Just as the average child today has no problem with computers that completely baffle his grandfather , so children absorbed the significant change in man 's outlook without difficulty , and retained it as adults . So perhaps in a single generation , or perhaps over the course of 50,000 years , mankind 's new consciousness developed . He became fully aware of himself aware of himself making decisions , of himself thinking , of himself thinking about thinking . He became aware of his own mortality . This sort of thing may be literally unimaginable for animals , but is easy for modern human minds . Self-consciousness : the ultimate awareness . It may have seemed as if this awareness was a thing apart from the body , a spirit inhabiting it , that perhaps moved on to another body when this one died . Perhaps the root of all religion was here . Most creatures appreciate the company of their own kind . When man became self-conscious , he wanted the company of other self-conscious people . Ile was able to appreciate that if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared 126 PIERS ANTHONY  | his own ultimate death , so might others . He wanted to share his special awareness with them , and to draw comfort from them . But how does one communicate self-consciousness to others ? How can one be sure they understand ? Words can convey concepts but not all feelings . There was a need to share what went beyond vocabulary , however sophisticated the language might be . This may have been where the arts came in . The sophisticated symbolism of language was only one ability of the new mind ; it could appreciate the symbolism of a sculpture , or a drawing , or a dance , or music . Music , perhaps more than any other art , appealed directly to the aware mind , and stirred special emotions in it . When one aware person sang , and others listened , all of them knew that the others were experiencing similar awareness . They were sharing the feelings of their own kind . And so self-consciousness may have led to complex language and all of the arts , including perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not only able to communicate in ways others literally could not dream of , they were able to share feelings others lacked . This enabled them to congregate in much larger groups without quarreling , and in that unity was strength . A multitude could rest quietly , appreciating the arts . Listening to a tale of self-aware people experiencing unusual adventures . Watching a lovely woman dance , pantomiming hope , joy , love and sex . Singing together , feeling the united emotion . Sharing the dream . Sharing religion . This change worked its way slowly through the minds and natures of the water folk , and slowly spread out across Africa until they all had it , until at last it reached that fringe in Asia Minor that was balked by the entrenched Archaics and Neandertals , who were well adapted to their life-styles and their terrain . When Modern minds made that conversion , they faced the vast terrain of Eurasia with potent new tools of understanding , technology , and social order . But this time their conquest was not by conversion , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camaraderie of the arts , the unity of group self-awareness ; it was by conquest . For the first time they were displacing those whose capacities were not even close to their own . Thus the conquest occurred in a geological instant , and the other descendants of Homo erectus were gone . They had been replaced by the gracile dreamer.  | To recap the complex development of the modern human mind : as anatomically modern humans spread out from Eden across Africa and leaked across the Sahara Desert to touch Asia Minor , the mind continued to change in the heartland . As with computer software that lags behind the hardware , the realization of the potential of the human brain took time . What had started as a way to address life in the water as well as on the land enabled the brain to grasp new ways of thinking . Self-consciousness came : thinking about thinking . The need to share such awareness with others , to know that they too felt it , led to far more sophisticated modes of expression . The vocabulary of nouns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabling people to address the past and future as well as the present , and to speculate on what might be as well as what is . The arts , speaking directly to the new sensitivities , became important , distinguishing mankind from all prior efforts . Perhaps the first of these were music , dance , and storytelling  --  none of which leave evidence for the archaeological record . The time is about 30,000 years ago , on the southern coast of what is now France . THE settlement was some distance in from the shore , but they had no trouble finding it because of the well-worn paths to the sea . Hugh led the way , carrying their supplies , with little Chip following close behind . The natives knew they were coming , of course . No stranger approached a settlement without being noted , watched , and reported well in advance . But there should be no trouble , because they were obviously not a war party , but a family . And they wore the body paints of entertainers . They should be welcome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmed . The spirits did not take kindly to those who harmed their messengers . Indeed , by the time they saw the shelters , the folk were out awaiting them . The tribe leader was a large , gruff man , but though he carried a club he was not in a threatening posture . " Who are you ? " he demanded as the family came to a halt before him . " Hugh the flute and Anne the dance , " Hugh replied in the standard manner . " We come to make you happy , for your hospitality , as long as you wish us to stay . " The man gazed at Anne , who was artfully posed with one hip outthrust . He nodded , needing no second glance to appreciate the aspect of a beautiful woman . " I am Joe . Accept our hospitality this night , and for other nights if our people like you . " " Fair enough , " Hugh agreed , and Anne rewarded the man with a brilliant smile . Joe licked his lips , knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe turned and led them on into the settlement . There were about ten houses formed of poles and hides , and a central hearth well banked with coals and ash at the moment . The houses were in a rough circle , their door-flaps facing inward ; space was cleared beyond them to allow people to be sure that no person or animal was close . Few creatures challenged man by day , but some did explore by night . A woman approached . " I am Bunny , " she said . " I will help you make shelter from our materials . " " Thank you , " Anne said . This was a routine courtesy for invited guests ; the tribe provided the makings and helped the visitors put up their house . When the visitors departed , the house was taken down again . Normally the poles or hides were marked , showing that they were for temporary SHAME OF MAN 129  | residences . Visitors had a special status , not being expected to forage or hunt with the tribe , and not being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the good will of tribe members , and this was made clear throughout . Bunny was joined by her son and daughters , Stone , Doe , and Weasel . Stone was five or six , Doe four , and Weasel a toddler of two . Now Hugh understood why Joe had assigned this woman to help : her children came close to matching Anne 's children in age and gender . Chip was five and Mina was three . Of course these folk did not know that Mina had been adopted as a foundling , and it hardly mattered ; she had been part of the family from her day of birth . Only her glossy black hair differentiated her from the others . There was no need to mention that Anne had proved to be barren after birthing her first baby . The poles and hides were good , being made for this purpose , and soon the house was up . The children , at first abashed , were soon playing happily , running around the house in opposite directions and giggling . But as evening came , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribesfolk gathered for their evening meal , and sat in a circle around the fire . There was space for Hugh and Anne to do what they had to do . Now was the time of reckoning ; if they were not entertainers , they would be denied food and sent away . Hugh brought out his bone flute . It had a cutaway mouthpiece across which he could blow to make a whistling sound , and five holes he could cover with his fingers . It did not look like much , but he had practiced on it for years and knew his skill was good . He had always had a special ear for sound , and now was using that awareness to pay his way . Anne got the children settled , then dressed for action . Now she wore a grass skirt , and removed her jacket , leaving her upper portion bare . Hugh 's practiced eye noted the narrowing of the eyes of the tribe men , and the play of their tongues around their mouths as they got their first clear look at Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , with her brown hair descending to her midsection and her tiny waist and broad hips . But it was her breasts that had the greatest impact ; they were surprisingly large and firm for a woman with two children . Of course she had made a specialty of her appearance , normally veiling it with clothing and posture , then emerging like the brilliant sun from behind clouds . Few would have guessed that she was twenty ; her face and body seemed five years younger . After a suitable pause for the men to assimilate the sight , they started . I I ugh blew a note on his flute , then another , going into a well-practiced song . There was a faint appreciative murmur from the tribesfolk ; they recognized immediately that he was skilled . They loved music , as all people did ; it struck through to their inner feelings . Then Anne began to dance . She had been absolutely still , like a wood carving ; now she moved her slender legs and swung her broad hips from 130 PIERS ANTHONY  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men smiled , instantly appreciating the sex appeal . The women were expressionless ; it would not be suitable for them to evince similar pleasure . But they understood this art well enough , and perhaps were making mental notes . Hugh 's melody intensified , growing louder and faster . Anne moved with its beat , skipping , and now her breasts shook and bounced , and her special anklets rattled as her feet struck the ground . Her thighs flashed through the grass skirt as she lifted her legs high . She began to sing , at first matching Hugh 's tune , then going into counterpoint . Hugh , still watching the audience reaction as he played , was gratified to see several mouths fall open with awe . They had never heard counterpoint before , but they felt its power . This was music beyond their experience . When the song and dance was done , there was a light sheen of sweat on Anne 's body , further enhancing it . It was clear that all of the men and a number of the women were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But anyone can do it , " Anne said . " I can show you how . See , even my little daughter has learned . " And she nudged Mina , who , ready for this , went out and made her bottom move . The effect was hardly as potent as it had been for Anne , but it was clear that if such a small child could project her hips that way , any girl or woman could . The audience was clearly impressed . " And anyone can play the flute , " Hugh said . He glanced at Chip , who brought out his own little flute . He proudly tootled a recognizable melody . Joe stepped forward . " Eat , friends , " he said . " And tomorrow  --  teach . " Hugh nodded . Of course the tribeswomen and elder girls wanted to learn how to make their bodies move like that , and the men wanted to know how to do counterpoint . Dancing was a woman 's natural performance , and music was a man 's ; those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Anne would teach them the fine points of their techniques . The process would require several days , and life would be easy during that period . That was the point . When the learning was done and interest waned , they would move on to another tribe and repeat the process . This was the nature of their livelihood . They had a good dinner . Then a number of tribesmen came up to Hugh , asking about his flute ; he let one of them try to play it , but all he got was an ugly whistling squeal , as Hugh had known he would . Tribeswomen approached Anne , inquiring how she had achieved such a good body . And the children were popular with the other tribe children . It was a successful evening . " How do you play music so well ? " a man asked . Hugh gave his standard answer : " The spirits are with me . " Anne said much the same , with respect to her ability to dance so provocatively . Of ' course they had both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did SHAME OF MAN 131  | some others , without having the same success . And they did respect the influence of the spirits ; they seemed to have had good fortune since adopting Mina , who had been left out to die . It seemed the spirits appreciated their effort to keep the baby alive . Spirits had greater concern for the welfare of the very young and innocent than they did for relatively corrupt adults . So they were happy to give the spirits credit ; that complimented the spirits , and kept their favor . But at night , in their house , Hugh spoke of a disquieting note : " I saw one man who resented our popularity . " " And I saw one woman , " she agreed . " His wife ? " " More likely his sister . She is close to our age , but does not seem to have borne children . I do n't like her . " " There are a few such in every tribe . Now that we have identified them , we 'll be wary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " So are her children . Her husband is away , searching for a new foraging area for wood . She says she is glad he is away , because she does n't want him to see me . " " A nice way to compliment your appearance . " " Perhaps . But it seems he dreams of a woman , though he is true to Bunny , and so she fears the effect of any pretty stranger . " " Men do dream of pretty women , " he reminded her . " I have not felt the need , myself ; however ? " She struck him lightly on the shoulder . " Leave that unfinished . The odd thing is that Bunny does n't think that her husband 's dream woman is especially pretty . There 's just something about her that captures his fancy . But perhaps a pretty woman might substitute for that mysterious quality . So Bunny prefers to play it safe . " " As she should , " Hugh agreed affably . " If he saw you , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Oh , you would not be lonely . You could keep the children  --  Bunny 's and yours . " " What delight , " he said wryly . " What 's wrong with it ? " Chip demanded from the other side of the chamber . At that they all burst out laughing , and went to sleep . 1 n the morning most of the men had to go out hunting , and the women out foraging . Bunny remained in the settlement , watching her children and others . She talked to them , encouraging them to learn new words , and did her best to keep them out of mischief . Anne helped by demonstrating her hip swing for the girls . The little ones could n't do it , but they loved trying . ' Tey had more success when she showed them how to fashion anklets that 132 PIERS ANTHONY  | rattled when they stomped their feet . Soon they were marching in step , thrilled by the massed beat . Hugh , meanwhile , worked on another bone flute . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and carved on it when he had time . The holes had to be placed just so , or the notes were wrong . So he would make a small hole , blow the flute , then enlarge the hole in the direction required to get the note right . He had a special ear for it . This took time and care , but he enjoyed it , because he knew that few others could do as good a job as he did . Most folk could not even select a good bone , not realizing that the musical qualities of bones differed , so that each had to be tested . It would be a shame to waste a good bone with bad holes . " Just do n't carve any more holes in me , " Anne said teasingly . " I wo n't improve , no matter where you place them . " He glanced at her appraisingly , about to make a suitable response . But at that point Joe approached , accompanied by the resentful man and trailed by a woman . Hugh paused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man , " he murmured . " And the woman , " Anne agreed . " I do n't like either of them . " But that was only approximately true , in the case of the woman ; there was a certain fascination mixed with the repulsion , for a reason he could not fathom . Had he known her elsewhere ? " Bub says you use the wrong hand , " Joe said . Oh , that . Usually no one noticed , but sometimes there was mischief when they did . " I use the correct hand for me , " Hugh replied carefully . " You hold your knife in your left , " the man Bub said accusingly . " Why should I not ? One hand is as good as another . " He hoped they would not come up with the worst answer . " Because that 's the bad spirit side , " the woman said . " Everyone knows that those possessed by bad spirits are warped , and bring bad times to all with whom they associate . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let it stand unchallenged . " This is not something I know , " he said mildly . His eye crossed the gaze of the woman , and it was as if something jumped between them . She had a brooding look , and considerable sex appeal . That might speak to her motive : she did not like being displaced for even a few days by another woman . " Because you 're warped , " Bub said triumphantly . " You bring trouble . " Hugh looked at Joe , and saw that the man was in doubt . He evidently was not unduly smart , and could be guided by bad persuasion . " We have never had trouble with the spirits , " Hugh said mildly , though he was angry and disturbed inside . " We travel much , alone through the forests , and they leave us alone . " " Because good spirits do leave folk alone , " the woman said . " It 's the had spirits who hurt people . They do n't hurt the ones they possess , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed by bad spirits can bring them into good tribes , and bring disaster . Our children are at risk . " Such folk always brought children into it , though it was Hugh 's impression that they hardly cared for children . Joe wavered . " That is known , " he agreed . " Sis is right . " It was evident that he did not want to have to send Hugh and Anne away , because the tribe liked their show , but he did n't want to risk mischief from the spirits . Anne got in on it . " This is nonsense , " she said . " I use my right hand , and I have not suffered from my association with him . " Sis looked sneeringly at her . " The bad spirits use you to lead them in . They will throw you away when they are done . " Hugh saw that the two had rehearsed this , and would prevail unless he did something extraordinary . Similar complaints had gotten him exiled from his home tribe , starting his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept such charges without fighting back . " What would it take to prove that I merely use the hand I choose , and have nothing to do with bad spirits ? " " Go into the burial cave for a night , " Bub said . Hugh felt a chill . He did not like burial places , and not just because they could be littered with bones and smell awful . It was that they had rescued Mina from such a place , and he feared that if she ever went there again , the spirits would change their minds and take her back . Sis saw his doubt . For a moment as their eyes met , he thought she wanted something else of him  --  that she found him as guiltily intriguing as he found her . But he averted his gaze . Then she spoke : " You ca n't go there , because you know it is filled with good spirits , and they would destroy you . They do n't like the intrusion of bad spirits . " So that was it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne permanently by getting the spirits to kill them . All because the tribe liked the visitors and valued what they had to teach . The choice was now between death and ignominious departure . Hugh looked at Anne , but before he could speak , she did . " We 'll go to your cave , " she said . " We know the good spirits will not hurt us . " Hugh winced . It was not at all smart to provoke the spirits like that . Spirits did not much like any intrusions , especially by night , especially by strangers . They could kill the family merely for being there , not even caring about who was left-handed . But he could n't reverse what his wife had said ; that would bring shame on her . So they would have to risk it . He nodded , not trusting himself to speak . Bub smiled grimly . " Tonight , " he said . " We will close you in so you ca n't sneak out before morning . " Worse yet ! Hugh might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance and see outside , able to escape if the spirits attacked . But to be closed in ? ! ' ' The spirits like music , " Anne murmured , reminding him . 134 PIERS ANTHONY  | So they did . But did they like it enough to counter their natural resentment of the intrusion ? Hugh experienced a sick doubt . " I will inform the tribe , " Joe said , obviously ill at ease . He had been maneuvered into this as much as Hugh and Anne had , but had to play it through , as they did . Sis stared at Anne . " You fool , " she said witheringly . " You will never walk out of there . The spirits know . " It seemed that it was Sis 's jealousy that drove this . She had fastened on Hugh 's left-handedness as a pretext the tribe would accept . As his gaze crossed hers once again , Hugh had the odd feeling that the woman , far from being repelled by his reverse-handedness , was perversely attracted to it . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it disgusted him . There was something about her , and her hate/love focus on him . Then the day returned to normal , seemingly . But when others could not hear , Bunny spoke to them , quietly , while facing elsewhere . " Those two are the ones possessed by evil spirits , " she muttered . " Bub and Sis  --  they are not really of this tribe . But somehow they got Joe to let them stay . They stop anyone else from being accepted . He 's a tough fighter , and many men are afraid of him , and she seduces those who are n't . " She snorted delicately . " Though I do n't see what they see in her . " " Some men like willful women , " Anne remarked . " Not to marry , but to dally with . " " I hope my husband encounters none such , " Bunny said . " At least I know he ca n't stand Sis . " " How do you know ? " Hugh asked , genuinely curious for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes near , and his penis shrinks . " Hugh forced a laugh . " Those are apt signs . " " So why did n't yours ? " Anne asked mischievously . She had him there . She had n't even been looking at him when Sis was close , yet she knew . But she also knew that he was in search of no other woman of any nature , however much he might react to them in passing . He already had the best . So she joked , having no concern on that score . " I was standing too close to you , my love , to be repelled , " Hugh replied after a moment . " If I met her alone , it would be another matter . " Both women laughed , appreciating an apt response . But in the evening they had to go to the cave . " Why not sleep in the house ? " Chip asked . " We 'll stay in the house again tomorrow night , " Anne told him reassuringly . " But tonight we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have warm blankets . " " All right . " " All right , " Mina echoed , as she tended to . The cave was some distance from the settlement , as such places usually SHAME OF MAN 135  | were , because it was not wise to camp within the normal range of spirits of any persuasion . The entrance was dark and low ; they had to duck well down to enter it . Hugh led the way , carrying his torch . He knew that the torch would not last long , and then they would be in complete darkness . They would have to find a suitable place to sleep before it guttered out . He dreaded the occasion . " Oooh , it stinks ! " Chip exclaimed , intrigued . " Because this is where their dead live , " Hugh explained . " Can I see one of the dead people ? " " Yes . Perhaps several . " They had carefully taught their children not to be afraid of the dead , because of Mina 's origin ; they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that they had any objection to anyone who had died . So they always spoke well of the dead , hoping to keep the favor of the spirits , and so far that had been effective . But privately both Hugh and Anne had some concern . These were the dead of a foreign tribe , and their spirits well might be resentful of the intrusion . There was no doubt the hostile spirits could and would kill the living , if aggravated . Hence Hugh 's dread . His first priority was to make peace with these spirits . He moved his torch around , exploring the cave . It widened and deepened beyond the narrow entrance , so that there was room for them to stand without stooping . There were no bodies in view ; they would be placed well inside the cave , for protection . But there was no doubt they were there , as Chip 's nose had ascertained . The tribesmen were meanwhile rolling the barrier boulder up across the entrance . It nudged close , closing them in . The seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edges , but the space was not large enough for any of them to get through . That air helped , for it carried the fresh outside odor of the forest , pushing back the queasy stench of death . " First we must introduce ourselves to the spirits , " Hugh announced . " Otherwise they might not like our bothering their bodies . So we shall play and dance for them . " He handed the torch to Anne . Its smoke was moving forward , into the cave , as if this were the mouth of a huge beast that was inhaling . Chip nodded , liking the notion . He had seen how living tribesfolk were charmed by music and dance , so it made sense that dead folk would have similar sentiments . They had on occasion entertained the spirits of animal skeletons , so that they could pass unmolested ; the principle was clear . So Hugh led the way deeper into the cave as it slanted up into the mountain , playing his flute . Chip followed , playing his own flute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally Anne , holding the torch steady despite the gyrations of her body . They were making a procession toward the chamber of the dead . The cave went straight back into the mountain , on and on . Hugh had had 136 PIERS ANTHONY  | no idea it went so deep . He worried that the torch would burn out before they found the bodies . He did not want that ; it would be an awful affront to the spirits if he stumbled over a body . So he walked faster , still diligently playing his music . The others followed , continuing their playing and dancing . They all understood how important it was to keep the spirits pacified . At last the passage ended  --  in a sharp upturn . They had to scramble up into a higher level . Hugh removed his pack and set it on the floor , and Anne did the same ; no one would steal them from this place . He played one-handed as he wedged his way up , while Anne danced below , charming the spirits with especially luxuriant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked around in the dim fringe of light from the torch below . There was a much larger chamber , with points of stone rising from its floor like giant animal teeth , casting living shadows against the receding walls . And here were the bodies , spread between the teeth . The smell intensified . The drift of air had stopped ; this was the depth of the breathing beast . He found a place where he could hold on and reach a hand down to help the others . " I must pause , 0 spirits , " he said . " So I can bring my family up here to entertain you . I will play again soon . " He hoped that the spirits were not impatient . They had listened very quietly so far , so he thought they understood . He caught Chip 's hand and hauled him up . " O000 ! " the boy exclaimed , spying the bodies . He was fascinated . " Play for them , " Hugh said quickly . Chip settled himself and resumed playing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was certainly a stink worthy of his appreciation . Hugh hauled Mina up , and set her to dancing beside Chip . They made a nice miniature couple who would surely charm the spirits . Then he helped Anne up . She could not dance while scrambling , but she moved so lithely that the spirits might not know the difference . She held the torch in her free hand , and the rock shadows crawled weirdly as it came up . When they all had secure footing among the dead , they did a full show for the spirits . Hugh played his flute as never before , and Anne danced so voluptuously that it seemed likely to lift any penises that had n't rotted away . When the show was done , they were quiet , waiting for the reaction . There was none . That was a good sign . The spirits were accepting them , having appreciated their offering of entertainment . Still , it was best to be sure that there would be no change of mind . Hugh brought out some charcoal he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such figures had protective properties ; spirits did not like to pass them . He would make a drawing here , to bar the spirits from descending into the lower tunnel . SHAME OF MAN 137  | He looked for a suitable place to draw . Then he thought of a better notion . Mina was a child of spirits , having been rescued from death ; she had always been their real protection from spirits , ever since they had taken her from a death grove . The drawing should be hers . But she would not be able to do it effectively ; she was n't that skilled with her hands . So he decided on a special technique he knew . He bit off a mouthful of charcoal . He chewed it up , getting it saturated with saliva . Then he guided Mina to the neck of the entrance cave . He took her tiny hand and laid it against the rough stone , the fingers splayed wide . And he pursed his lips and blew , spitting out a stream of liquid charcoal . She giggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand firmly in place until he was done . Then he lifted it away . There was her handprint  --  outlined in sprayed black . It was a marvelously spiritual effect . Mina was delighted , and Chip was jealous . " But your hands must be clean , for playing the flute , " Hugh told him . The boy recognized the validity of that . Mina 's little hand was filthy with charcoal spit . They made their way back down into the lower tunnel . There was no further need to play and dance ; the spirits had accepted them , and now Mina 's handprint would prevent the spirits from coming down after them . They would be able to rest , and to sleep . That was just as well , because the torch finally guttered out . Anne had kept it going as long as she could , but now its spirit would join those of the people in the main cave . The family was in complete darkness . They linked hands and walked toward the entrance . It would be more comfortable there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curl comfortably together , and in the morning , when the tribesfolk rolled away the stone , the four of them would emerge fresh and smiling . The troublemakers Rich and Sis would be discredited , and the rest of the stay here would be good . The spirits were still smiling on those who understood and honored Them . This cave is now known as Cosquer . It can no longer be entered afoot ; when the ice age ended , the level of the water rose , and the Mediterranean Sea expanded across lands that had been near the shore . The cave had been several miles inland , but now its entrance is more than a hundred feet below the surface . All of the access tunnel and half the main cave is flooded . So are the camps and hunting grounds of mankind in that region ; you might say that mankind lived under the sea . We may never know the details of the lives of those coastal dwellers , because the sea washed them out . Two thousand years after Mina left her handprint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood only recently , another tribe used the cave fin- paintings . They cleared out the bones and decorated the cave first with more hand stencils , then with the largest variety of animals and designs known 138 PIERS ANTHONY  | in such a context . About a hundred animals have been found painted or engraved , including three auks  --  the only such depictions of this seabird known . But this may be only half the original total , because the rising water washed out the lower ones , including Mina 's original handprint . It seems natural that when self-consciousness brought awareness of similar awareness in other human beings , folk also suspected that it existed in animals and even in inanimate things , such as the surging sea , shaking mountains , and the dead . The spirit of self-consciousness seemed to exist apart from the tangible body , perhaps as an independent entity . If there was doubt , it was better to play it safe , and propitiate any spirits that might be in the vicinity . Thus , perhaps , another beginning of religion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasurable in themselves , so they continued to flourish wherever mankind existed . It 's too bad that music and dance left no tangible records in the way that painting and sculpture did . We have no evidence that musical counterpoint existed in early times , yet our deep appreciation of it can hardly have developed only in the past thousand years , so here it is assumed that it existed , though in limited form . We have surely missed man 's most dynamic artistic aspects .  | Start at the Atlantic Ocean . Pass east through the narrow Strait of Gibraltar to enter the smaller Mediterranean Sea , around which so much of mankind 's political development has taken place . Pass northeast through the Dardanelles Strait and on into the yet smaller Black Sea , a region more important than many historians have credited it for being . Pass north through the Kerch Strait into the tiny Sea of Azov , widely unknown . This is surely a backwater of human activity . Yet here , perhaps , began one of the greatest ongoing conquests of all human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PIERS ANTHONY  | The time is about 6,500 years ago , and nothing much is happening . Yet retrospect can provide significance for even tiny events . A S the dawn came , it was clear that the spirits had let them be . Perhaps it was the music and dance they had done by the burial ground at dusk , and perhaps the magic symbols they had drawn in the dirt . But Hugh believed it was mostly that little Mina had always been a child of the spirits , and that the family was safe as long as she was part of it . They had acquired her somewhat haphazardly , but it was clear that their lives had improved thereafter . Rather than hurry out of the deep sacred grove as if afraid , they delayed , waiting for the tribesmen to come and find them . Anne served out crusts of bread , while Hugh cleaned up their campsite ; it would not do to leave a mess in spirit territory . Then as the sun blazed hugely across the water of the great lake , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their locale . That , of course , was part of the act . They were making toys for their children . Hugh fashioned a wheeled wagon , while Anne made a tiny pot . Naturally the children asked awkward questions . " Why not just carry the stuff ? " Chip asked . He was curious about everything , just as Hugh himself had been at that age . " Because more can be moved on the wagon , " Hugh replied . " If there is a level trail to push it along . " He demonstrated by pushing the toy wagon with his finger . The carved wheels squeaked , and the wagon weewawed as it moved , but it did make progress . Chip smiled . He pushed the wagon himself , liking the way it reacted . Meanwhile , Anne presented Mina with the pot . It looked just like a real one , with its wide round top and pointed base . " Do n't try to jam it in the ground yet , " Anne cautioned her . " Wait for it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned it around in her hands . Though still tiny , she was already clever with her hands . She liked to paint pictures in dirt , and she could play the little wood flute Hugh had carved for her , making recognizable tunes . In fact she took after her parents to such an extent that no one would have guessed she had been adopted . " I want mark it , " she said . " You can decorate it with a stick , " Anne told her . " It is still soft . Just use the point to make your marks . " " That too long . I want nice mark , now . " Anne cast about for something . " Maybe you can roll it on something , to mark it . " " No . " Then the child caught up the cord that tied her clothing together . She wrapped it around the tipper rim of the jar , pressing it in . When she SHAME OF MAN 141  | pulled it away , there was the pattern of the cord , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded . " That 's very clever , Mina . Maybe I should decorate my own pots that way . " " Yes , " Mina said decisively . " They 'll look nice . " Then they heard someone coming , and waited quietly . It turned out to be the woman called Seed , with her three-year-old son named Tree . She had helped them get settled in the village two days ago , and her little boy had played with Mina . Hugh had a strange feeling for a moment that there should have been two or three small children , but of course that was a fleeting dream fragment . He found himself taken by such bits of unreality at times , and had learned to shake them off . Seed was perhaps the most beautiful woman he had seen , apart from Anne . And of course Anne caught him looking . She laughed . " I will teach her to dance just like me ; then you will know for sure . " Hugh did not reply . Anne was not the jealous type ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he touched no other but her . Seed looked relieved as she joined them . " Of course I believed that you had the confidence of the spirits , " she said . " Yet I was concerned . " " We are charmed by the spirits , " Hugh said . " Now we shall return to your tribe and teach you music and dance . There should be no more trouble with those who doubt us . " Seed still looked uncertain . " Sis is jealous of Anne 's beauty , and seeks to undermine it . I know the way of that . " Surely she did , being lovely herself . " But they ca n't do anything more , " Anne said , half in question . " Those two are devious . You must watch out for them . " " We shall do so , " Hugh agreed . They went to the village center , with its clustered oval houses , where the women were suitably impressed to see them alive and hale . They went to work , with Hugh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anne and Mina instructed interested women in the art of provocative ( lancing . A white-clad priest watched , but stayed clear ; he was present only to show that this matter had been cleared with the priesthood and was not objectionable . Most of the villagers wore the brown clothing of the herders or cultivators . Hugh and Anne wore green , the innocuous color of travelers . Seed was the first to try the dance , while little Tree eagerly attempted Chip 's flute . The little wooden flute was expendable ; Hugh had promised to make him a good one from a bird bone , similar to Hugh 's own , when they found exactly the right bone . Seed was not only beautiful ; she had a natural grace that facilitated her motions . Soon she and Anne were dancing together , matching step for step , hip for hip , smile for smile . Hugh stared , 142 PIERS ANTHONY  | entranced ; they were like twins in their beauty , one in green , one in brown , the very essence of all that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the one in brown had green eyes , the seeming contrast enhancing the symmetry of their beauty . A crowd was gathering , similarly intrigued , though perhaps the reasons differed with the sexes . More women joined the class , and Hugh played his melodies for them all , because music gave form to dance . He put Chip on the taut hide drum he had made , keeping the beat . Some of the men joined the dance , unable to resist the lure of beat and melody . It was becoming an excellent session . But it could not go on forever . The villagers had work to do . So they agreed to return in the evening , when there would be another show . In the interim , Hugh and Anne could rest . Food was brought for them : barley bread , fermented mare 's milk , baked fish , and dried strips of pig meat . They were eating well . Then a woman approached , and they became cautious : it was Sis , who had caused her brother to challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a dusky , sultry creature , unsmiling , but possessed of a healthy body . Surely she did not want to learn to dance . She came to stand before Hugh . " There is a crippled child who dearly loves music . His family begs you to come play for him . I have brought horses so that you can go there and return with dispatch . " Seed looked up and nodded ; it seemed that there was such a child . Hugh was taken aback . This was the last thing he had expected from this sullen woman . Yet it seemed it was legitimate . He looked at Anne . Her eyes narrowed , then relaxed . " Go , " she said . " I will rest here with the children . You should get experience on a horse . " She knew what most others did not : that he was well experienced with horses , and enjoyed riding when he had the chance . So did Anne . On those occasions when they had access to horses , sometimes they raced each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately as they traveled , they would have trained their own . But because he did not trust this creature Sis , he did not clarify this . " You will have to lead me . " Sis tried to mask her contempt for his supposed inadequacy . " The horse will follow mine , " she said . " You have merely to hold on . " He walked with her to the horses . They were good enough animals , well cared for . The Yamnaya folk took pride in their horses , for they were one of the few tribes who had domesticated them for riding . Elsewhere , tribes hunted horses only for meat , not understanding how much more useful they could be . As a result , the Yamnayas and related tribes were far more mobile than most , and controlled a larger territory than their numbers might have suggested . There were two mares , hobbled so they would n't drift . They were grazing at the edge of the village . Either mares or stallions could be ridden , but the SHAME OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , being larger , stronger , and more spirited . Still , Hugh knew that a good mare could run well enough . " There is yours , " Sis said . " She is well trained and docile . " Hugh could tell that by looking at the mare . But he did not try to mount her . He merely stood as if not knowing what to do . " I will help you mount , " Sis said . " Stand directly by her side and bend your left knee . I will heave you up . " " Oh . Yes . " He lifted his left foot , so that it was behind him . Sis locked her fingers together and put her linked hands under his knee . She heaved , and he swung his right leg up over the horse 's back , so that he landed solidly . " Thank you . " Sis then went to the other mare and mounted with considerably more dispatch . She knew horses , he could see , while she thought him a duffer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case she was up to something . Sis clicked to her mare , and the horse started forward . Hugh could have guided his animal similarly , but did not . However , after a moment she started on her own , following her companion mare . Horses tolerated people , but preferred the company of their own kind . They moved at a pace at first leisurely , then briskly . Hugh got two handfuls of his mount 's mane , making a show of hanging on , though he was not in discomfort . Sis was perhaps teasing him , trying to see how fast the horses had to go before he begged for a slower pace . Actually she was doing him a favor , unknowingly , because he was able to get to know the mare in her different paces , and to have the mare get to know him . He did this by murmuring to her in a voice too low for Sis to hear , and by applying pressure with his knees , guiding her where he wished . She was responsive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rapport with a horse was one of the most important aspects of training . But to Sis it looked as if he were barely surviving . After a time she slowed the pace , perhaps concerned that he would fall off , and she would get the blame . They came in due course to the shore of the great lake . " Itti 's family lives on an island , " Sis explained . " We will leave the horses here with hay . " There was a crude enclosure with hay piled within it , so it was clear that the horses would be all right . Hugh dismounted clumsily , but patted the mare on the side away from Sis . " We shall be together again soon , " he murmured , and the mare rotated her near ear in acknowledgment . Sis led the way to a small stone wharf where a wooden boat was docked . " Do you know about boats ? " she asked . " Of course , " he said , looking doubtful . He had not had the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had used them on occasion . It was part of the business of traveling. 144 PIERS ANTHONY  | " Then take a paddle . " She lifted a long wooden paddle from the boat and gave it to him . He caught it on the paddle end and continued to look doubtful . Again he noted her half-masked expression of contempt . Yet there seemed to be interest , too , in the way she covertly assessed him . Yesterday she had tried to get rid of him , because he was left-handed ; today she had some other notion . He did n't trust it . That was why he was playing stupid ; he did not want her to know his abilities . " Like this , " she said . She took the other paddle and held it so that the flattened end pointed down . " Now get in the boat . " He climbed in and sat at the end that floated in the water , facing back . She gave the boat a shove so that it slid the rest of the way into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift one leg high and then the other , showing her firm thighs under the hide skirt . He appreciated again that whatever this woman was or was not , she had a good body . She settled herself , then stared at him . " Face the other way , " she said shortly . " Oh . " He had wondered how long it would take her to appreciate this particular evidence of ignorance . He turned himself around clumsily , in the process losing the paddle overboard . Then he almost overturned the boat while reaching for the floating paddle . What a duffer he seemed to be ! They finally got moving , and his paddling improved somewhat under her tutelage . She had taken the rear seat on the assumption that he would not be able to guide the craft , and he had pretty well confirmed that assumption . It was a kind of game that he hoped she did not know was being played . He still did n't know what her own game was . The island was a distance east as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sis 's sharp corrections enabled him to get the hang of it . He noted that she did n't tell him how to scull , to guide the boat straight forward despite paddling on a single side . So she thought that he would be unable to move the craft efficiently if he found himself alone . They came to another stone wharf , docked , and climbed out . In the process he was treated to another glimpse of her handsome thighs , but he could n't tell whether it was deliberate on her part . She might simply hold him in such contempt that she did n't care what he looked at . There was a path up to the house , and there was indeed a lame child there . Hugh did what he did best , and not only charmed the child and his family with flute music ; he brought out one of the simpler wooden flutes he had crafted and gave it to the boy , teaching him how to blow notes on it . A lame boy should have a lot of time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readily . The family was most appreciative . The man , Itti , was of the warrior class , garbed in red , and surely prominent . He gave Hugh two sheep 's knucklebones that would he excellent for gambling , and had fair SHAME OF MAN 145  | value in their own right . It seemed likely that there would be no objections , the next time Hugh 's tour brought them to this region . Then it was time to return to the village . Hugh followed Sis back down to the boat , noting the way her hips swayed as she walked . Now he had little remaining doubt : she was doing it deliberately . He knew because Anne was expert in the art of becoming sexually appealing , whether in a dance or otherwise . So , it seemed , was this woman . But what was her interest in him ? They got in the boat and paddled back toward the mainland wharf . But when they were farthest from either the island or the mainland shores , Sis paused in her paddling . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to , now it was about to clarify . The mission to play for the crippled child had been legitimate , but Sis must have volunteered to do it , so that she could achieve her own purpose . He now suspected what that purpose was , but remained mystified by its rationale . He laid his paddle down and turned around on the seat . She was in the process of stripping away her clothing . He watched as the top and bottom came off , leaving her naked body glistening in the light of the declining sun . She was splendid in all her physical parts . It was the mental part that kept him wary . He eyed the whole and the details . " You plan to swim ? " he inquired after a moment . She got right to the point . " I have a desire for you , wrong hand . Play your melodies on this body . " She had called him " wrong hand . " So she had noticed . The strangest thing was that he had a feeling that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it was not true . There was something about her body and her manner that not only attracted him , it made him seem to remember having sex with her . That was impossible , as he had never seen her before yesterday . So from where could such a memory come ? Perhaps from the similar sultry women who liked his music and who found the distinction of wrong-handedness appealing . Meanwhile his mouth was saying the obvious . " I am married . My wife is beautiful . " " But I can give you more . I am hot and lusty . " She inhaled , licking her lips and spreading her knees . " I need no more than she offers . " But the woman was stirring his desire . " Why not try me and see ? " She leaned forward so that her breasts shifted form . " My wife would n't like it . " Especially not with a woman like this . " Then she need not know . " She got off the seat and approached him , squatting so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more intriguing , as perhaps she knew . She had ready answers , having evidently rehearsed this scene . But what 146 PIERS ANTHONY  | was her real motive ? He had acted like an ignorant duffer in everything except his skill with music , a performance hardly calculated to incite a woman 's admiration or romantic spirit . He suspected that she had had this in mind from the outset . It surely was n't passing passion that motivated her , yet she seemed ready to give him what any other man  --  and Hugh himself  --  desired . Why ? He decided on a direct approach . " What is your interest in me ? I know I have not come across as a masterful man . " Her eyes narrowed as she paused in her approach . " So you were pretending . I wondered . You know the ways of deceit . " " You have not answered my question . " " I am jealous of your wife . I want to take you from her . " She resumed motion . That seemed true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly jealous of Anne 's beauty , but she should be just as jealous of Seed 's beauty , and she was n't going after Seed 's husband . There had to be some other motive . Meanwhile he had to act , lest she succeed in seducing him . It was time to turn this off . " No . I will not be with you . " She squinted at him again , and saw his resolution . " If you seek to avoid me , I will claim that you tried to force me . You are new to this tribe , and wrong-handed ; they will believe me rather than you . " Now she had reached him , and laid her hand on his arm . " You would not want that . " " Something other than passion for me motivates you , " he said , casting off her hand . There was a flicker of something other than anger in her face . But she quickly masked it . " Hit me , if you wish . " She caught at him again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried . " You are decoying me away from Anne . So that she is unprotected . " Now her teeth showed in a snarling smile . " Too late for her , I think . " Hugh leaned forward , put his arms around her , clasped her close , lifted , and heaved . Suddenly she was out of the boat and splashing in the water . He grabbed a paddle and scrambled to the boat 's rear seat , where control was better . Sis surfaced , her hair plastered , spittingly furious . " You ca n't get away ! " She reached for the boat . He lifted the paddle like a club . " Touch it , and I 'll bash you . Then you 'll have reason to accuse me  --  if you do n't drown . " Her eyes met his for a moment . Then her hand withdrew . " So you are indeed a man , " she said . " I am indeed . " He plunged the paddle into the water and drove the boat forward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After several strokes he glanced back . She was swimming for the shore . She was moving well , as he had thought she might . He had harmed no more than her dignity  --  and perhaps not much of 111 ; t . SHAME OF MAN 147  | Then he realized that her clothing was still in the boat . Well , he would leave it at the corral . He readily outdistanced the woman , for even a clumsy boat was better than swimming , when managed competently . He moved on to the shore , drew the boat out , and went for the horses . He considered , as he approached them ; should he free the other one , and send her running away , so that Sis had no mount ? No , he had a significant lead ; his business would he done before she caught up . Soon he was on his mare , guiding her without words . She responded eagerly to his competence , fairly flying across the terrain . Such rapport between man and mount was wonderful ; both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not understand such use of horses . They thought that meat was all they offered . He reached the village quickly enough , for he had wasted no time . Seed was there , minding his children and hers . " Where is Anne ? " he called . " Bub came to guide her to you , " Seed replied . " To join you with the lame boy , as you asked . Did n't you see her on the way ? " " No . " And he knew why : Bub had no intention of bringing Anne near her husband . His design was of a quite different nature . " Which way did they go ? " He suppressed the echo of Sis 's words : Too late for her . " To the north , where he had the horses . " Now Seed looked alarmed , but her voice was controlled so as not to alarm the children . " Bub has a house farther north . " Horses . Hugh 's growing tension eased a notch . " So they were riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The children will be safe here with me . " " Thank you . How long ago did they leave ? " Seed made an indication of two close fingers toward the sun , showing that it had not traveled far . " Not long . " Hugh nodded , turned his mare north and put her into a trot . Naturally Bub and Anne were not by the local corral . But Hugh could see the recent tracks of the horses going north . They were walking , because Anne would have had the sense to do what Hugh had , concealing her excellent riding ability . Bub would have told her that this was where Hugh had gone , but she would have been cautious , knowing that the man was of doubtful character . She would have taken time to get to know her horse . Then , if the trip turned out to be false , she would ride swiftly away , and Bub would not catch her . But if the man had had the wit to get her to dismount , to separate her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Well , even then Anne was not a likely victim . Because she was a dancer . St ill , Hugh fingered his dagger nervously . He did not want vengeance , he wanted his wife safe . Then he saw ( lust rising to the north . A single horse was coming , galloping south , expertly guided . Soon he recognized the flowing ( lark hair 148 PIERS ANTHONY  | of a woman , and soon after that he confirmed that it was Anne . They drew up together and reached out to touch hands . Then they turned their mounts south , walking . " Sis ? " she inquired . " Naked in the lake . Bub ? " " Indisposed in a field . " No more needed to be said ; they understood each other . They returned to the village . Later Anne gave another class in dancing . She showed a new step , difficult for many women but beautiful in execution because of the flash of flesh it showed . It was a quick step away from the partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . " Take care that you are not too close to your man , " she cautioned the women . " It could be unfortunate . " Hugh played the music , nodding to himself . He suspected that Bub had stood too close , and been the recipient of that swift waist-high kick . Then he would have been inclined to drop to the ground for a time , suffering the pain only a man could feel . He would be unlikely to speak of the matter to others thereafter . But he would probably never again approach a dancer carelessly . While the adults danced , the children played with their toys . Chip showed off his wagon , and pretended to hitch it to a horse , being intrigued with the foolish notion . Mina was proud of her unique design , pressed into the hardening clay by her belt cord . The other children were impressed too , by both the notion of hitching horses to wagons and of decorating pottery in such manner . But of course they were too young to appreciate why such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good session . The Yamnaya tribe was one of a group of proto-Indo-European cultures that had domesticated the horse . This made them highly mobile , and they expanded over a wide area of the steppes . They also had wagons , but it seems that these were at first moved by manpower ; their horses were too small to be used for such brute work . However , in time they figured out how to connect more than one horse at a time to a single wagon , and this magnified their mobility . This may be the explanation for their subsequent greater expansion , not merely across the thinly populated steppe but into the settled agricultural regions . A change in climate may have helped shift the balance of effectiveness toward the pastoral peoples , making more grazing land . At any rate , expand they did , all across western Asia and Europe and on to India . We know this because their corded ware spread out , identifying them , and their languages displaced those of prior cultures in these regions . Today the Indo-European family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and governs most of the world 's territory . Only China , southeast Asia , the . south Pacific islands , northern Africa , and Asia Minor are excluded , apart /rum isolated spot cultures such as the Basques of Europe . Were this considered SHAME OF MAN 149  | an empire , it would be the greatest ever known . We conjecture that the use of the horse , at first to ride , then to haul , and finally in battle , gave such an advantage to the Indo-Europeans that they were able not only to conquer the more settled societies , but to dominate them indefinitely , so that their languages came to prevail , just as English ( one of the Indo-European languages ) is spreading today . The economies of power were Indo-European , not because of any particular leader or ideology , but because they had a better way . The horse culture was here to stay .  | A bad storm buried a village in the Orkney Islands north of Scotland about / 500 B.C. Another storm uncovered it more than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an untouched prehistoric community site was revealed . Its buildings survived because they were hidden  --  and because they were stone . Had there been enough wood there for building , we might never have learned of it , because wood disintegrates with time . Had it been exposed , the stone might have been taken for other purposes . So this was one of the accidents of preservation : a village of six to ten houses made of slate , beside the cold North 152 PIERS ANTHONY  | Sea . Skara Brae ( not " Scary Bra " ) . They would not have called it that , of course , but we shall consider this to be our translation of their own name for it . This was the fringe of what we call the Megalithic culture , whose earliest monuments predated those of Egypt and spread across much of Europe . The best known example is Stonehenge in southern England , but there are others , and there were perhaps a larger number of Woodhenges whose ruins have been lost to history . Who were these mighty ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant stones , some of which might weigh as much as sixty tons ? How did these primitive people quarry , move , and erect such monsters ? Gradually the wild speculations have given way to more solid conjectures . Skara Brae and the associated Stones of Stennes perhaps show the way . The time is circa 3200 B.C. , near the beginning of this settlement . 0NE might have thought that things would be quiet the night before the annual Festival of Stones , in preparation for the strenuous activity to come . But there was too much excitement , especially among the children , for this year Chip and Mina were being allowed to attend . They were seven and five respectively , and had shown that they were able to walk a distance when they had to . So instead of being farmed out to their older neighbor Lil , to join Lil 's grandchildren , they got to share the great adventure . They were supposed to rest , but were irrepressibly excited . The sheep , however , were another matter . One had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Hugh 's contribution to the effort . The others Lil would watch , in return for the wool of one of them next season . And Hugh 's eight-year-old nephew Jay would come to occupy the house , to care for the dog and see that no rats got into their supply of barley . So all was ready . All they had to do was get a good night 's rest . And that seemed to be almost impossible . The children could not relax . Anne served them a good supper of boiled limpets , because not only were the little shellfish plentiful and tasty , their knuckle-sized disk-shaped shells usually gave the children much entertainment . They would roll them at each other , and make high piles of them , and pretend they were jewelry or imitation teeth . But even this ploy was ineffective this time ; Chip and Mina remained as animated as new lambs . They simply would not settle down on their cushion beds for long enough to fall asleep . Finally Hugh did what always worked : he brought out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sang , and both children were instantly enraptured . Of course they had to respect music , because it was special to the family , but it was more than that ; they really did respond to it at a deep level . Soon both were asleep . " And now what do we do to settle down ? " Anne inquired as they let their music die gently away . SHAME OF MAN 153  | " What do you think , woman ? " Hugh said , hauling her into him . So they made love , and it was effective ; they slept thereafter . In the morning Hugh was up first . He wrapped his sheepskin cloak about himself , called the dog awake , and went outside to urinate . They had a drained toilet closet inside , but he did n't bother to use it ; it was for the convenience of women and children . The house was joined to the next , and there was a narrow alley between them . There were six houses in all , each with its family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't much matter , but in winter , when the fierce storms could last for days , they made community life practical . In fact it was this strong sense of community that enabled them to carry through the bad weather . The dog led the way , long familiar with the route . They emerged from the tight cluster and walked out onto the shell midden against which the village was made . People had used this area for a long time before the present clan had occupied the site ; they did n't know or care who those others had been . Their refuse had long since settled and become land , useful to brace the present houses . There were stories of harder times and stories of better times in the past , but all that mattered was how it was now . He checked the house from outside , as he always did . The stone wall was secure , of course , but the thatch over the whalebone roof beams could get out of order and had to be watched . The last thing they wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw Bil emerge similarly from the alley . Hugh gave the man time to complete his private business , then went over . " Your children settle well ? " he inquired . Bil laughed . " No more than yours ! " Because Bil had two who would be going along too . The two men were close , for a reason that was not a fit matter for discussion : Hugh had had an early relationship with Fay , who had left him for Bub , but then left Bub for Bil . It was as if Bil had finished Hugh 's unfinished business . Their children Wil and Faye matched Hugh 's in ages . " Start with the sun one fist high ? " Hugh inquired , naming the time they had agreed on . " Yes . " Bil turned to check his own thatch , and Hugh returned to his house with the dog . Anne was up now , wrapped in her sheepwool gown , breaking bread into chunks for breakfast . She had n't bothered with a fire ; there was n't time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always made sure of the food before tending to herself . " You are beautiful , " he told her . She made a face , pulling her hair across in a momentary veil , then smiled . " Eat before the children get it , " she said , setting out a chunk and a bowl of sheepcurds. 154 PIERS ANTHONY  | He sat at the stone bench beside the center hearth , in the wan light from the small window , and dipped the rock-hard bread into the soft curd . This was like the relation of man to woman , he thought , the soft complementing the hard . It was a good way . Anne retired to the private closet to catch up on herself . He admired her rounded rear as she got down to pass through the low access portal . Any crisis that appeared now would be Hugh 's responsibility , until she emerged . As he gnawed on the softened edge of bread , he gazed around the chamber . He was proud of this house , which he had maintained since taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small , because it served also as a community center . He and Anne often entertained the others when it was not possible to work , and that diversion could be the difference between unity and fragmentation . The main bed was against the center of one wall , with its cushions and heath to soften the stone , and fleece blanket for warmth . The cupboard was against another wall , with its crocks of food and jugs of water and sacks of grain : their security against drought and freeze . The children slept to the left of the main bed , in the corner by the closets . He focused on them for a time . Chip 's brown hair matched Hugh 's own , and indeed he was clearly of their family . But little Mina 's glossy black hair was something else , shinier than Anne 's tresses . Anne styled the girl 's hair to match her own , and the two did have a similarity of appearance . But Mina was not a blood child ; they had adopted her as a foundling baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight throughout . Yet it was more than that . Mina had an affinity for the spirits . Even bad spirits did not molest the family when Mina was there , and sometimes good spirits gave warning in subtle ways when mischief was brewing . That was an advantage they could never have anticipated when they saved the baby from death by exposure . They had no idea who her natural mother was ; they had found her during a stone festival , when the whole island congregated . Perhaps she had simply been a gift of the spirits . As if conscious of his gaze , the little girl stirred , waking . That jogged Chip awake too . In a moment the two were scrambling competitively to be the first to reach the private closet . " Hold , people ! " Hugh cried warningly . " Your mother 's there now . " So they charged the bench instead , ready to gnaw on bread . " Are we still really going ? " Mina asked , her eyes big and wonderful . " We are still really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flung her little arms around his neck , kissing him wetly on the cheek . Then she grabbed a chunk of bread and began to gnaw enthusiastically . Anne emerged , her appearance improved . Chip charged the closet . SHAME OF MAN 155  | Mina , on the wrong side of the bench , seeing herself hopelessly behind , elected to ignore it . Her turn would come . Already she was learning to be graciously feminine when covering her losses . They moved out before the sun was one fist high . Hugh lagged just long enough to be sure the dog did n't come . Other families were doing the same , making a rare crowding in the passage . They filed out to the gathering place . Chip extended his arm and made a fist at the sun . " Hey  --  it 's more than one fist up ! " he exclaimed . " We 're late ! " Hugh extended his own fist . " No we are n't . Your fist is smaller than mine . " " Oh . " But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much excitement to allow small errors to remain long in mind . When the sun was right , by Bil 's fist , they set off : Six men , ten striplings , one woman , three maidens , and five children . Half the village , leaving behind most of the women , children , and old folk . Because this was not simply a celebration ; it was the important working ceremony of the year . It was the Festival of Stones . The distance to the ceremonial center was not far ; a man traveling at a running jog could have reached it by noon . But though every person traveling was healthy , there were constraints . Two men were hauling a wagon loaded with food , blankets , coiled ropes , and special clothing made for the occasion , and sometimes that wagon needed extra hands , for the trail was narrow in places and steep in others . The children were full of energy , but would slow as the novelty wore off . The woman  --  Anne  --  and maidens would be tending to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they were so inclined . They were not so inclined , because they preferred to appear dainty  --  and the men preferred to have them appear so , at least for this event . Because their appearance at the festival could enhance their prospects for marriage . So it would be near dusk before this party reached the center . They proceeded inland , roughly southeast , veering as necessary to avoid difficult terrain . The men shifted off on wagon hauling duty , making three teams ; they , at least had no concern about getting sweaty . Hugh took the kit side , so that his dominant hand was outside , in case of anything unexpected . Others in the village did n't care about his sinister handedness , Intl sometimes strangers did , so he masked it as a matter of course . Even so , Chip had been known to get into a fight because of it . Hugh had mixed feelings about that , but overall he was satisfied that neither child resembled hint in that respect . ' They stopped for lunch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maidens fetched bags of cold water from a nearby stream . Anne made the children lie down to rest , and by this time they were 156 PIERS ANTHONY  | tired enough to obey . It was a nice day , with just enough wind to make the heat of effort reasonable . In late afternoon they reached the center . This was an open level region from which the hills all around could be seen . The children were especially impressed with the view of the steep cliffs of the large island to the south , which could be seen beyond a lake . A great circle was marked on the turf , surrounded by a curving ditch enclosing a region fifty paces across . A single enormous stone poked upright from the ground , three times the height of a man . Tomorrow they would erect a second smaller stone . The folk of other villages were arriving similarly . Bil directed his group to a suitable campsite , then nodded to Hugh . Hugh went in search of the clan leader , whose tent he thought he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lake there . He needed to check in and give the count of working men from Skara Brae , and also the maidens . " Daddy ! " He turned , startled . There was Mina running after him , her black tresses flying . She was about the cutest little girl he could imagine , and in another decade would surely make a beautiful woman . But what was her concern He waited for her to reach him . " What is it ? " he asked as she arrived . " Did you lose your mother ? " " No , " she panted . " I think  --  I think you need me . " " I always needed you , precious child , " he said , smiling . " No , I mean really , " she insisted . " For the spirits . " He looked back to the camp , and saw Anne . He waved to her , to confirm ' that Mina had reached him safely . " Then come along , " he agreed , taking the little hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she did indeed have a feel for the spirits . She was in her sweet way a haunt ed child . They walked on north . As they approached the large camp , he picked Mina up and carried her in a sitting posture . She put her arm around h i s neck for security , facing forward . Three youths were lounging before the big hide tent . " I come to see . Joe , the clan leader , " Hugh said . They eyed him with expressions bordering on insolence . " Hey , it 's 11 lc spooky one , " one said . " With the wrong hand . " Hugh experienced a familiar surge of anger . Was he to be insulted Icy these striplings when he came on business ? Then Mina turned her face to look at them : first one , then anodic ! , then the . third . And they blanched . " In there , " one muttered , moving away . Hugh concealed his amazement . The child had stared then ) down ! 11c knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeming like infinitely deep SHAME OF MAN 157  | pools of water , but this was new . The spirits must have shown through her gaze . " Thanks , precious , " he said , and carried her on into the tent . Joe got up as he entered , and came to give him a bear hug that was gentle enough not to squeeze the child . " Welcome , Hugh , " he said . " I 'm always glad to see you . Did Bil come too ? " " Yes . And four more . And three maidens . " " And Anne , of course ? " And my wife , " Hugh agreed . " And who is this little maiden ? " " My daughter Mina . She came to protect me from spirits , but all we encountered was three youths . " That was as close as Hugh cared to come to reporting their insolence . Joe looked Mina directly in the face , appreciating her aspect . " You will be a priestess one day , " he said seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already . " " Yes . " Hugh realized that Joe understood what had passed between Mina and 1 he striplings . Joe had never been known for intelligence , but he recognized and appreciated power of any type . That was why he was the clan chief . Those who related to the spirits were respected . Joe returned to business . " We have a good group and fair weather . We 're going to try to erect two stones , flanking the Watch Stone . It 's not right to leave it only half attended . " Hugh nodded . " Our men are ready . And our youths . " " But I want you on the drum . " " I understand , " Hugh said , though he was hurt . " No , it 's not for your hand ! That 's nothing . Sometimes my own left works better . It 's that there may be an attempt to hurt you or blame you for trouble . I do n't know who , though I suspect . So I want you safe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you suspect ? " Hugh asked . " I must not say . Who kicked whom ? " Answer enough . There had been bad blood between Hugh 's family and the brother/sister team of Bub and Serilda . When Bub lost Fay , he seemed to have gotten interested in Anne , perhaps in a notion of revenge , wanting to deprive Hugh of what he most valued . Last summer the man had tried to waylay her , and walked into a dancing maneuver he had n't appreciated . Bub had never spoken of it , but news had gotten around . Serilda had never married . I high was confident of his ability to handle Bub , should it come to violence . Bub was larger , but Hugh had greater finesse with the hand axe , 158 PIERS ANTHONY  | and Bub knew it . So it would n't come to violence . But Bub had devious ways , so was dangerous . " I will drum , " he agreed . " Unless we have to have you on the rope , " Joe said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striplings were gone . He set Mina down and they walked back to their own camp . It had been an interesting visit in more than one sense . In the morning Hugh was first up , as usual . But as he returned from the communal refuse pit , he discovered little Mina stirring . " Daddy , someone was here , " she said . He laughed . " Half the clan is here , precious . It 's the Festival of Stones . " " In the night , " she said insistently . " Doing something . " Hugh frowned . " A stranger ? In our share of the tent ? " " Yes . I colored his shoe . " Hugh trusted his daughter 's sincerity , but not necessarily her judgment . Someone could have blundered into the wrong section , and departed quietly upon discovering his error . But thievery was known , when so many people got together . " Show me exactly where he was . " She pointed to their piled family supplies . He checked , but nothing was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his coil of rope were where he had left them . " It 's all right , Mina , " he said . Anne appeared . " Something wrong ? " " Someone blundered by here in the night , " he said . " Mina marked his foot . " Anne tried to be serious . " Mina , you should n't dye folk 's feet , " she said . But it was clear that she found it as funny as Hugh did . Someone in the camp might have a red boot . With luck , that person would not realize it soon , and would not know who had perpetuated the indignity . After that it was rushed . Hugh set up his drum , stretching the leather across a big earthen pot and drawing it tight . It might not be the most melodic instrument , but it was loud and had a certain urgent quality of sound that was what they needed for parts of the work . He hauled it to the working area some distance from the camp , joining Joe and Bil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first lightly , then more firmly . This was the signal to get started , and all the working men and striplings converged . The two great stones were lying on the ground near where they had been quarried earlier in summer . Quarrying was a somewhat tedious business , in which suitable boulders were located and separated into proper fragments by fire and water . Wood soaked in animal fat was laid along the line where the split was to be , and set on fire . When it burned out they cleared away the ashes and poured cold water over it , and the stone cracked along that line . They also pounded it with globular stone mauls , a number of men striking SHAME OF MAN 159  | along the line in unison to break it farther apart . All this required special expertise and coordination , and the trained crew was the only group allowed to do such work , lest a good stone be ruined . Now the men and striplings hauled timbers into place . There were not many suitable trees here , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . They made a large sledge by fitting short cross timbers across long runner beams and lashing them together . This stout sledge was hauled into position beside the stone . Now came the hard part . Hugh changed the beat of his drum , to get them perfectly coordinated , while Joe shouted the orders . Men with long stout poles levered up one side of the stone while the striplings hauled on a multitude of ropes from the other side . " On three , " Joe cried . " One , " matching the loud drum beat . " Two . Three ! " All the levers and ropes went under tension together , and the giant stone heaved up on its side . Others shoved blocks in to hold the elevation when the levers were removed , but the boys on the ropes held steady . Then they shoved the sledge in close under it , and scrambled away before the ropes were slackened . The stone fell back down , over the blocks , and crashed onto the sledge . It was now half on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes and levers to nudge it by stages fully onto the sledge . They tied it in place so that it would n't come loose no matter how it might be tilted . Now round roller beams were laid beyond the end of the sledge , and the ropes and levers used to haul it onto the series of rollers . When it was fairly on them the work was easier ; the ropes alone were enough to heave it forward , beat by beat . As it left rollers behind , men carried them quickly to the front and laid them down again . So it continued , moving grandly along its track toward the erection site . But the hauling was still hard work , leaving men and striplings panting , and glad to have the water the maidens brought to them during their rest shifts . They brought the stone all the way up to its place of erection . This was a hole that had been well prepared , shored up inside by surrounding stones , with guide stakes driven in along the far side . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant end so that the near end slid grudgingly into the hole and thunked into place at the bottom . They had to jam in more blocks at each stage , and lever it up a little more , so that its erection was actually rather slow . Hugh 's drum made the beat throughout , keeping it coordinated , for any mistake could send the stone crunching dangerously wrong . A pyramid of cross-stacked planks formed behind the stone , from which the men kept working . Only when that structure was almost as tall as the stone itself were they able to get it all the way vertical , and fill in the rear of the hole with small rocks . I t was done  --  and though the work had seemed to move right along , the day was fading . It was time to relax and celebrate . Hugh beat a new cadence  | on the drum , and the maidens of the several villages came out , provocatively dressed , and danced while the men finished their supper . Anne directed them , for the dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motions of heads , arms , legs , and hips that would have been perhaps in bad taste on any less important occasion . But here the rules of behavior were to a degree suspended ; this was after all the Festival of Stones . The men of course loved it , and there were no mature women to protest . Anne did not count ; she pretended for the moment to be one of the maidens , and such was her figure that it was an excellent emulation . Her hair and torso moved in ways that excited admiration and lust , as they were supposed to , and Hugh was glad that she was his wife . The maidens emulated her movements , shake for shake and kick for kick , making a most intriguing array . Especially when the kicks were high . Among the maidens was Serilda , who was qualified despite being older because she had never married . She too had a figure to be reckoned with , and her slippered feet seemed tiny . She oriented on Hugh with her stare and did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tried not to look as she showed her thighs , but could n't prevent it . Each summer she did this , fixing on him though there were many single men who would gladly have married her . He had once thought she would not have the nerve , because Anne was here , but she clearly had no shame . Anne was remarkably tolerant , evidently feeling no threat , but Hugh felt it . Serilda acted as if she had some claim on him , as if there were some secret between them . And the way his body reacted , it was almost as if it were true . Worse , he had the feeling that her closest loyalty was to her brother Bub , who had tried to rape Anne . Bub was here , but had remained well away from Anne so far . How was Serilda 's evident interest in Hugh connected to that ? How could Serilda dance in Anne 's class while at the same time trying to vamp Anne 's husband ? The pieces of this puzzle did not quite fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for the maidens to choose partners for the evening . Everything was reasonably proper ; they would merely keep company with their chosen young men for the evening , in the view of everyone . But such acquaintances could lead in due course to marriages . Maidens could not marry within their villages , so this was one of their few opportunities to meet the men of other villages and examine prospects for the future . They had been watching the men as they worked , so now had some notions about whom they would like to get to know . Anne herself stepped back , doing a relatively sedate individual dance to cover the interval . The youths were seated separately . The maidens now addressed that section , each closing on a particular youth and offering him the flower from her hair . He could accept it and be with her , or decline . The maidens this SHAME OF MAN 161  | time were unusually pretty , and the dance had been unusually provocative , so it seemed unlikely that any would decline . Indeed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except one had men to be with . They brought the men to their family groups for introductions . The one remaining maiden was Serilda , who had not deigned to offer her flower to any of the youths . Instead she cast her eye around a wider range  --  and it fell again on Hugh . Oh , no ! Was she going to try to shame him publicly by pretending to a relationship that did not exist ? It seemed she was , for she forged toward him , lifting the flower from her hair . His response should be clear : he would reject the flower . He wanted no part of this suggestive ploy . Anne knew he had done nothing with Serilda , but others might not know , and tongues would wag . But as she approached , she did not offer him the flower . She tossed it to him , making it impossible for him to decline . The flower landed neatly in his lap . Since the moment a man touched the flower the date was made , he was stuck for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching his . Her body was warm from the recent exertion of the dance , and her breathing remained heavier than normal . He did not look at her , but her presence was dynamic . He knew that all around them the other families were marveling . They were surely conjecturing whether he had had a secret affair with her , that was now becoming open . Did she want to be his second wife ? Such arrangements were rare , but not discouraged , because sometimes there were more women than men and it was best that all women be married . Did that explain why she had passed up those men who had expressed interest in her ? Was she tired of secrecy , so she was forcing the issue now , shaming him into recognizing her ? All these conjectures must be going around , and it would be difficult or impossible to refute them . Now the grog was poured and circulated , and the party proper proceeded . Anne came to join them , bearing three mugs of it . She handed one to Hugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been expected to join them . Then she sat with her own mug on Hugh 's other side . Bub was sitting well distant , not trying to provoke any trouble  --  and this , too , might be cause for alarm . Dusk was falling , and they watched the stars come out . The plan of the stones related to the sun , though Hugh understood that the right priests with the right circles could track the moon and even the stars with marvelous precision . So when the sun set on this center , the work was over . The carousing continued far into the night . Hugh drank and danced with Anne , ignoring Serilda as well as he could . Serilda remained close , but did not make any additional scene . Apparently she was satisfied just to be near hint . That , perhaps , was mischief enough . 162 PIERS ANTHONY  | At last they retired to their section of the tent , where the children had gone to sleep long before . Serilda did not follow , to Hugh 's relief . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they made love and sank into slumber . On the second work day they loaded and moved the second stone . But two men who had overworked themselves the first day turned lame and had to desist . Now Joe did what he had n't wanted to do , and put Hugh on a rope . Hugh had his own rope with him , as he had the day before , in case of need ; the need had come . He was privately glad of it ; he wanted to do his physical share . A promising stripling was put on the drum . They loaded the stone on the sledge , and hauled it down to the circle . All was going well . But when they made the supreme heave , starting the stone on its way to the vertical position , it did n't budge . This stone was heavier than the other one , and the men were tired after their prior day 's work and night of carousal . So Joe joined Hugh on his rope . " Heave ! " he cried as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the rope snapped . Both of them took hard falls , amazed and disgruntled . The lifting came to a halt . " I knew you should n't have put that weird hand on the sacred work , " Bub said . " The spirits are turning against us . " There was a murmur . This was indeed holy work , for all of its festive aspects . The spirits had to support it . If they were annoyed , all would be lost . " Hugh is n't bad for the spirits , " Joe said . " It 's just an accident . They happen . " " You say that because you 're his friend , " Bub said . The murmur supported him ; the men were afraid that he was right . " He should be banished , so the stones will be sacred . " Bil came forward . He looked at the severed ends of the rope . " This rope did n't break naturally , " he announced . " It was cut . " " How could it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right along . " " Inside , where it did n't show , " Bil said . " I have worked with ropes ; I know the difference between fraying and cutting . The inner strands were cut ; the outer ones broke . Someone did this . " " You 're his friend too , " Bub said . " Your word is no good on this either . " And the muttering was growing , supporting him . At last it was coming clear : here was the mischief Bub had devised . Weakening Hugh 's rope so that it would snap under stress , setting back the work , maybe injuring someone , and discrediting him . Because he was left-handed , and therefore under chronic suspicion . Bub had found a way to get back at him for what Anne had done . And if he managed to get Hugh banished , then Anne would have little effective defense against Bub . SHAME OF MAN 163  | But how had Bub managed to weaken the rope ? It had been with Hugh all day , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Mina had said . " Call for my girl-child , " he told Joe . " Question her . " " That 's a spirit child , " Bil said . Joe looked at him , surprised , nodding . Then he shrugged . " I must investigate this , " he said . " I must know exactly what happened . Bring me Hugh 's children . " The surrounding muttering became a murmur of surprise . What did children have to do with this ? But the others did not object , because Joe was their leader and he had almost been hurt by the breaking rope , and he was investigating . Anne came , bringing Chip and Mina . Joe addressed them both . " What do you two know of cut ropes ? " he asked gruffly . Chip gazed blankly back at him , but Mina jumped right on it . " Someone came ! Night before last . By Daddy 's rope . I marked his foot . " " Who came ? " Joe asked . " It was all dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . I put my dye on his shoe . " " There by Hugh 's rope , " Bil said thoughtfully , loudly enough to be heard . " Two nights ago . And he did not use that rope yesterday , so it did n't break then . " " What color dye ? " Joe asked the girl . Mina held up her little dye bag . " That 's a clue , " Bil said . " But in two days that die could have been washed out . Still , if the man did n't know it was there ? " " Line up ! " Joe roared . " All men ! Striplings too . Show your feet . " Confused , the men obeyed . Almost all of them were sweaty and dirty , and their boots were soiled with dust and grease , but the bright dye should show on them . Joe walked along the front of the row , and Bil along the back , peering intently at boots . And came up with nothing . None had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , " Joe said . " These are the only ones they have here . " Changed them . Hugh remembered how the maidens had brought changes of clothing , so as to do their dance . Today they were back in their working clothes . " The girls , " he said . " Check them too . " Bil nodded . " It could have been a woman . " " Maidens ! " Joe shouted . " Line up next ! " The maidens formed a line . Their boots lacked dye too . But two of the ( lancers were missing . " Where ? ? " Joe started . There was a commotion . Then two women fell to the ground , scuffling . Anne had tackled Serilda . And there as they fought was the guilty boot : on 164 PIERS ANTHONY  | Serilda 's foot . She evidently had not noticed the dye until now , or had not realized its significance . She had tried to sneak away , to get time to scrub it off , but Anne had stopped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held Serilda captive . " You cut the rope ! " Joe accused her . " To avenge your brother . " Serilda hesitated , and decided on a course . " I did it for myself , " she said . " To get Hugh exiled . So I could have him . " She was protecting her brother , so that he would not get banished too . There was nothing they could do about that . " Then you are banished , " Joe said . " Leave this clan , and do not return , lest you be killed . " Serilda nodded . " I will fetch my things . " The men let her go , and she went to her section of the tent . Bub stood mute , giving no sign . But it was clear that his plot had turned against him , costing him what he most valued : his sister . And his vengeance against Hugh , who had been vindicated . After that they returned to work erecting the stone , and by dusk the job had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been a good Festival of Stones . We do n't know the details of the culture of the Megalithic builders , but it could have been like this . We do know something about the manner they handled their huge stones . No modern machinery , no aliens from space are required ; they did it with their technology of the time . The Orkney isles were at the fringe of this culture , not as advanced as those settlements nearer its center , but their designs were similar . The site described was constructed at Stennes , with twelve stones in a circle , probably relating to solar observations . Later another was made nearby , the Ring of Brodgar , with sixty stones , probably a lunar observatory . There has been much debate on exactly what observations might have been done at such sites , and at their more sophisticated and famous cousin at Stonehenge in England , but there seems to be persuasive indication that rather precise observations were made over the course of many centuries . The natural cycles were very important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megalithic cultures endured , before being displaced by cultures with bronze and more productive agricultural techniques . Thus , in a literal sense , the stone age gave way to the ages of metals . But they left behind monuments like none seen since .  | The second millennium B.C. ? that is , roughly 2000 ? 1000 B.C. ? was as busy and violent in the Levant  --  that is , the east Mediterranean coastline between Anatolia ( modern Turkey ) and Egypt where there are now the countries of Syria , Lebanon , and Israel  --  as the second millennium A.D. , A.D. 1000 ? 2000 . More succinctly : things are always popping in the Holy Land . Homer 's Iliad describes a bold foray by the collected Greek city-states against the key city of Troy in Anatolia around 1200 B.C. Forget the surrounding mythology , which is formidable , involving the Golden Apple , the abduction of Helen , and the ten-year e ( rt to rescue her . The real motive for the war was 166 PIERS ANTHONY  | political and economic : the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this too may not be the real story . The Odyssey describes the adventures of the Greek hero Odysseus on his way home after that war , when he encountered things like the forgetful lotus eaters , a one-eyed man-eating giant , and the luscious but dangerous sorceress Circe . This , too , may be a euphemism for a more practical reality . The Illyrian , who lived in the Balkans ( present-day Yugoslavia  --  another chronic hot spot ) , advanced south into the Peloponnesian peninsula , displacing the Dorians of northern Greece , and the Dorians moved south to displace other Greeks , many of whom had to take to their ships to escape . These became the Sea Peoples , who ravaged Anatolia , Crete , Egypt , and the Levant . In fact it may be that the adventures of the Iliad and the Odyssey were merely the Greeks ' version of what to all the other inhabitants of the eastern Mediterranean were destructive raids by barbarians on ships . The Hittite Empire of Anatolia was destroyed . The Egyptians managed to repulse a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levant , and thereafter that region was named after them : Palestine , from the Peleset , now called the Philistia . The Philistines do appear to have been Mycenaean Greeks ; their shields and armor matched , as did their pottery , and a number of their names echo those of the heroes of the Iliad . So now perhaps we know where Odysseus went : to the Levant , where his people made a new nation , much to the frustration of neighbors like Egypt and Israel . Two hundred years later , about 1000 B.C. , the Philistines were in firm control of the region , having thrown off any obligations to the Egyptians and subjugated the Canaanites who were the local natives . More was to happen in this region  --  much more  --  but for the moment let 's consider the situation from the perspective of the Philistines . HUUO kissed Annai farewell at the dock , and hugged his eight-yearold son and six-year-old daughter . He hated to separate from them , but this was a special tour where children were not welcome . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cared for them this month ; her daughter Desert Flower was Minah 's age , and the children got along well . But it seemed best simply to let Huuo travel alone , while Annai and the children maintained the household . This occasion came only once a year , and that could be handled . " Be careful , Daddy , " Minah said as she let him go . Her eyes were great and dark , as if formed from the same midnight substance as her hair . She was not their natural child , having been adopted as a temple foundling , and the aura of the goddess seemed to cling to her . It was already understood that she would be a priestess when she came of age . Not one of the ordinary ones who gave sexual solace to male worshippers , but a ranking temple official with direct communion with the god . She was as different from her brother as night from day , but the fancily tacitly concealed this , lest sonic SHAME OF MAN 167  | god decide that she was suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep the children home : so as not to attract undue attention . " I will , " he promised her . " You protect your mother from evil spirits while I 'm gone . " He smiled as he said it , but it really was not a joke . " I will , " she agreed seriously . Then he turned and walked the gangplank to board the ship with its bird-headed prow and stern . He turned again as he stepped onto the deck , and waved to them . Some men clearly enjoyed this annual respite from their families , but Huuo did not ; had it been feasible , he would have had them all come with him , including the servant and her child . But the expense would have been prohibitive . Huuo himself paid nothing , instead being well paid for his expertise , but the others would have counted as baggage . Annai blew him a kiss as the ship put down its oars and stroked smartly from the pier . She was ethereally beautiful in the morning sunlight , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress alternately flattening against her shapely dancer 's torso and tugging away from it . For a crazy instant he wanted to dive into the water and swim back to her . But the family needed the excellent pay he would receive for this tour . Certainly her love would keep ; she was as constant as any woman could be , though she could have done extremely well as a woman of the temple . She simply preferred to allow no man but her husband to touch her , and Huuo was hardly inclined to debate that . He made his way past the oarsmen and down into the hold , where the cargo was stacked under waterproof cover . The ship rowed out to sea , and there picked up a fair north wind . The oars were shipped ; the galley slaves could catch up on their relaxation while the wind held . Huuo knew that they loved their games of dice and markers , and that the ship whore would get brisk business . Foreigners professed to be in doubt about the distinction between a whore and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of other cultures were . The priestess brought worshippers closer to the spirit of the goddess , while the whore merely sated animalistic passions . There was also a considerable difference in price , for those who chose to think of it that way . Actually there was no price for a priestess ; there was a significant donation for the welfare of the temple . One might as well compare a field laborer to a noble : both did their jobs , but could never be confused with each other . Huuo retired to his cabin , which was hardly more than a cramped tubby in the hold , and settled down for the ride . The ship was bound from Jaffa to Gaza , this leg of its larger route ; he had boarded it at his home city of Mor . There would be other stops along the way . It might have been faster to ride overland , but the ship was both safer and more comfortable . Though the Canaanites of this region had become properly subservient , their wilder neighbors of the mountains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never acceded properly to either authority or civilization . 168 PIERS ANTHONY  | Periodically they had to be put down , when they became too much of a nuisance . The independent cities of Philistia would contribute to a levee for mutual advantage , and a joint expedition would be mounted . Then things would return to normal for a few years , until the savages forgot the lesson and became obnoxious again . Sometimes one of their prophets would rouse them to violence in the name of their cult god , pretending that it was the only god extant ; sometimes it was just their natural depravity . It had been a while since the last punitive expedition , so the primitives might be stirring ; Huuo did n't care to risk riding alone through what the hill folk pretended was their territory . This festival tour was to celebrate the gods of Philistia , who had been reasonably kind . Other musicians would gather from other cities , each contributing its best ; they would tour the principal cities , performing together for each seren , or city lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn would wine , dine , and offer blandishments to the musicians , and the people of each city would throng in celebration . Were it not for his separation from his family , Huuo would have enjoyed the prospect greatly . He found himself unable to rest adequately , so he brought out his double flute and played , practicing for the big event . He hardly needed practice , but the music always soothed him , and he realized that his tension was because of the recent separation from his family . He closed his eyes and imagined Annai dancing as he played the melody and descant . In his fancy she languorously stripped away her scant items of apparel , until she pranced naked , as she liked to do when feeling free . That gave him comfort . " Sir . " Huuo paused , opening his eyes . A Canaanite sailor stood before him , apologetically . " Yes ? " " Sir , the oarsmen  --  they overheard your playing . They bid me inquire ? if it be not too great an imposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the oar deck as they row ? " Huuo realized that the wind had died , so the oars were resuming . Music could facilitate such labor . Flattered , he agreed . He got up and followed the sailor to the head of the cramped deck where the twin rows of oarsmen sat . The drummer was just establishing the cadence , so Huuo settled beside him and adapted his melodies to that powerful beat . The oarsmen grinned , and put forth extra effort , making the ship fairly leap ahead . It was a good event for all parties , because Huuo appreciated an appreciative audience of any kind , and the oarsmen liked the diversion , and the ship 's captain was glad of the extra speed . The ship put into port at midday at Ashkelon . There it unloaded ingots of copper and silver , and took on a quantity of fine textiles and assorted jewelry . Huuo was sure that the local merchant-thieves were cheating the pirate-captain , who was also cheating them , and that each was privately well SHAME OF MAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final buyers who wound up paying the most for the least . This was the name of trade . The cities of the seacoast flourished from it . In an hour they were back at sea . A contrary wind appeared ; the ship 's priest burned incense , but the wind merely strengthened . Huuo shook his head ; if he had brought his daughter Minah along , she would have spoken to the wind , and it would have changed . But then the captain would have schemed to acquire her , by devious means , and the situation would have become treacherous . Better a slow trip than that ! Now the captain approached him . He was a Philistine of middle age , grizzled , stout , but clearly possessing the competence of experience . " Captain Ittai here . My lord musician , do you play for the spirits ? " he inquired brusquely . Huuo smiled . He was wellborn but no lord , and the captain knew that . But Ittai was asking a favor . " I can play , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain lowered his voice . " I note you are bent to the left . " This could be trouble . Huuo had done his best to conceal his lefthandedness , because superstitious seamen could have violent notions about the curse of such a person on a ship . He played more instruments than the double flute , but he carried that one now because it betrayed no handedness unless one were sharp enough to observe that he played the dominant melody on the left . But the captain was evidently an observant cuss , and had read the little signals that could never be entirely concealed : which hand lifted higher when he was startled , which way he preferentially turned , even the momentary angling of his head . Concealing all of these little traits was an effort that could give him a headache from the continuing tension . So , unconsciously , believing that no one was paying attention , he had given himself away . " You choose to make an issue ? " Huuo asked in a carefully neutral tone . " By no means , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very mention of the matter had made the issue . " But there are those aboard who might react in an ignorant manner if the wind were unusually adverse . It seems best to me to negate the whole issue by seeing that the wind is not adverse . " Nicely put . " I will make an attempt to persuade the wind , " Huuo agreed , getting up and bringing out his flute . " But understand this : the spirits , too , have been known to take note of particular things . Were my effort to annoy them on that score ? " Ittai laughed . " On a day like this ? I have been at sea twenty years ; and never seen a storm blow up swiftly in such weather . The adverse risk is minimal . " He paused , then added : " Besides , the local waters are kind to the left . " That was a curious statement . But they were arriving at the incense site , and further dialogue would be awkward . 170 PIERS ANTHONY  | He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the north wind , which was the one they wanted . The south wind intensified . But he knew that these things were whimsical , and sometimes an increase preceded a reversal . He had no doubt that the spirits could change the winds , but suspected that they seldom bothered . Why should they do mortal men any favors ? Minah could evoke their attention and cooperation , but she was Philistia 's most winsome child . Huuo was simply a wrong-handed man . As if the thought of Minah affected things , the wind dropped , then changed . It gusted east , then veered south . There was a cheer from the oarsmen . It was sheer chance , he was sure , but Huuo made a small bow in the direction of the oarsmen , then retired to his cubby . He knew he was lucky that something ill had not happened . " Nice job , " the captain said . " I did n't want to get delayed today , because things can get complicated after a battle , depending how it goes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deals in Gaza and be on my way before news of any kind comes . " " News ? " " About the campaign against the Israelites . " " Oh , yes , " Huuo agreed , remembering . " There was a levee from Mor . But I would n't call it a campaign , just a routine cleaning up . The hill folk ca n't compete with civilized forces . " Ittai frowned . " You think not ? That upstart they call king , David  --  he 's a cunning one . That 's the one who took out Goliath , remember . Now he 's going for bigger prey . " Huuo was surprised . " The lucky lad ? I thought he was a musician , not a warrior . " " The same . The little harpist . We put him on the throne of Israel , as a Philistine vassal , but now he 's getting too big for his sandals and we have to take him out again . Remember , he learned warfare from us , from the years he served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trained him . So now the ungrateful lout will be using our own techniques against us . That 's what makes him dangerous . " Huuo nodded . " Dangerous , indeed ! Those wild hill folk have always been an annoyance . But still , their resources ca n't compare to ours . " " They took Jerusalem . That means they 're more than rabble . This rebellion has to be ended before it gets awkward . Weird things can happen in the field . " " You speak as if you 've had experience . " " Why do you think I 'm wary of David ? I was there at the battle of Ephes-Dammim , twenty years ago . We had the might to crush them , and should have done it , but the idiot generals agreed to a contest of champions . They figured no one could stand against Goliath . Then this sneaky shepherd used his sling to conk the champion on the forehead with a stone and felled him without ever coming close . I said then , may the gods SHAME OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little turd another chance . I retired from soldering when my levee returned , and have been a shipper ever since . The sea has always been my first love . But I 've kept track of David , and I know trouble when I see it . But do you think they 'd ever listen to someone who was only a foot soldier ? Mark me , we 'll be finding out the hard way . " " We surely will , " Huuo agreed , not wanting to argue the case with someone who was obviously highly opinionated . Then there was a call from elsewhere on the ship , and the captain had to hurry away to get it straightened out . The wind freshened , filling the sails , and the boat moved south at respectable speed . Huuo lay back . Now he could take his nap . For a time his mind wandered . The captain had reminded him of the encounters with the organized factions of the hill folk . More of that scattered history was returning to his memory . He had studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information about musicians . David the harpist , said to have been a talented player when young . That man was now a king ? He must be , for the name matched : King David . It would n't be the first oddity associated with the hill folk . There had been the time the hill folk had the giant . Instead of the Philistine Goliath , there had been the Israelite Samson , claimed to be the strongest man in the world . He was supposed to have single-handedly slain thousands of Philistines , though his first wife was a Philistine . Of course that had been a considerable exaggeration , but he had made a nuisance of himself . So they had put Delilah on him , and she fathomed the secret of his strength , and after that they chained him , blinded him , and used him for stud . Maybe Goliath was Samson 's descendant , no brighter than his ancestor , falling for the wiles of a woman or shepherd musician . Huuo drifted asleep , his dream picking up where his conscious thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scene , anointed the first king of Israel . Huuo found himself in the body of the soldier Ittai , when the Philistines fought a pitched battle with Saul 's crude army of hill folk . They beat the Israelis , of course . But then the enemy brought forth their fetish object , the thing they called the Ark of the Covenant . That made the Philistines nervous , because even primitive spirits could make a lot of mischief for mortal men . But the general urged them to attack regardless , and while the mischief of the spirits was chancy , the wrath of the general was certain , and they waded in . They slaughtered the hill folk and took possession of the Ark , and that was a real coup , because the enemy did n't dare attack as long as their sacred chest of artifacts was hostage . They took the Ark to the temple of Dagon at Ashdod and opened it up . Iiutto , though no priest , was somehow able to look over a priest 's shoulder to see inside . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motley collection of items of supposedly holy nature . But the Israelites believed in it , so it was n't destroyed . That was a mistake , for Huuo 's invisible eye saw something awful 172 PIERS ANTHONY  | seeping from it : the concentrated spirit of the hill folk , leaking out into the city . It squirmed its way into the sleeping bodies of the good citizens of Ashdod , and they turned dark and fevered and coughed their lives out onto the dirt . So the authorities moved the Ark to the city of Gath  --  and of course the plague followed . Only Huuo , in his dream eye , could see the noxious spirit crawling in snakelike streamers from its crevices and seeking out the living people . So they moved the Ark to Ekron , and that city also suffered the ravages of the terrible plague . Finally they realized what the nature of the problem was . So they returned the Ark , together with some token votive offerings , to the Israelites , and the plague ended . There was the lesson : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities . Swords could slay physical enemies , but not malignant spirits . And so Saul consolidated his new kingdom and harassed the civilized cities nearby . That was when they had to mount an expedition against him  --  and suffered the misfortune of the Goliath business . At which point Huuo woke . Now he had a refreshed appreciation of the problem of the hill folk , and could almost believe Captain Ittai 's dire concern about the current campaign . Those Israelites were slippery folk , and often luckier than they deserved . The ship was pulling into Gaza . Huuo gathered his things and stood ready to disembark . The captain approached . " Thank you for your assistance ; we are early . " " Thank you for your interesting review of the Israeli campaign , " Huuo replied . " I hope I catch your ship on the return trip before any serious consequences appear . " " That would be best , " Ittai agreed gravely . A uniformed palace guard was waiting on the pier as Huuo accompanied Captain Ittai off the ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seren Jaoch awaits you , sir . " " Awaits me ? " Huuo asked , surprised . " See , I told you the local waters are kind , " the captain said wisely . " But I 'm only the flautist , " Huuo protested . " Exactly , " the guard said . " Please accompany me to your place of honor at the palace . " Bemused , Huuo followed the man off the pier to a sleek riding wagon drawn by a sleek horse . This was the kind of treatment accorded to visiting dignitaries ; what was he doing here ? He did not quite trust this . They got in , and the guard drove the horse smartly along the road toward the walls of the main city of Gaza . This certainly was easier than walking , but still felt strange . " I would not question Seren Jaoch 's decisions , " Huuo said cautiously . SHAME OF MAN 173  | " But I am curious why an ordinary musician should be accorded such honor . " The man glanced sidelong at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I really do n't know . I have not been treated this well elsewhere . " " Seren Jaoch does not govern elsewhere . " Huuo realized that the man was not going to tell him , so he let it be . He satisfied himself with a good look at the approaching city . Gaza was larger and wealthier than Mor , and it showed ; the ramparts were significantly more formidable . And while in most cities there was an uneasy coalition of ruling lords , it seemed that Seren Jaoch was clearly dominant here . Surely he was a good man from whom to receive favor  --  and a bad one from whom to receive disfavor . Huuo would have preferred to enter this city unremarked , because a despot 's favor and disfavor could be separated by very narrow lines . The guards at the main gate waved them on in , evidently recognizing the horse and wagon . They moved through the aperture , and on down the central street of the city . The city inhabitants crowded back to give the wagon room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed behind almost in a blur ; Huuo simply was not used to traveling this fast . Then they were at the grand columns of the central palace . The horse came to a smart halt and servitors rushed up to help Huuo down to the pavement . As soon as he was clear , the horse , wagon , and palace guard moved away , leaving and female servants . Huuo knew there was n't any point in asking them anything , so he suffered himself to be stripped and bathed and garbed in clean , elegant robes . That meant that he would soon learn why he was receiving such special treatment . He was ushered to a small but extremely well appointed banquet hall . There stood a heavyset man who seemed no older than Huuo himself , reminding him vaguely of the captain , though this was clearly a far more important personage . The man stepped forward to embrace him . " So good to meet you , Huuo the Musician , " he said . " I am Seren Jaoch . " Huuo hastily bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am honored , lord , " he said . " Yet I fear you take me for a far more important person than I am . " " Importance is as it seems , " Jaoch replied . " You will eat with me , and we shall talk . " So it was no mistake . But what did this powerful man want of this routine musician ? The strangeness had not abated . They sat at the table , and the scullery servants brought in platters of lambsmeat and sweetbreads , and vials of wines so rare that Huuo could not 174 PIERS ANTHONY  | identify them . There was nothing to do but eat well , hoping he was not in some way being fattened for slaughter . But as he picked up his first morsel , he realized that Seren Jaoch was doing the same  --  with the same hand . He paused , assessing the implica-tion . Jaoch smiled . " Now you see it , musician . The hand . " " You are like me , " Huuo agreed . " Left-handed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , but those around me know . We need not discuss the reason . " Indeed they did not . Huuo knew what Jaoch faced . For a man of power it was perhaps worse , because others were always scheming to diminish or pre-empt that power , and there was a stigma to the left side that could too readily provide them an opening . " Captain Ittai remarked that these waters were kind to the left , " Huuo said . " I did n't understand his reference . " " A man needs associates he can trust , " Jaoch said . " My key personnel are all of this persuasion . " He lifted his left hand momentarily . " They know that their positions would wither away without me . They support me with extraordinary loyalty . " Huuo nodded . No threats would be required ; left-handers were normally discriminated against . Only when the leader was similarly inclined could they rise to prominence . " I am sure they do , " Huuo said . " But I lack one thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally from insomnia . Sometimes my lovely mistress , also left-sided , gives me solace . Sometimes music . However ? " Suddenly it came into focus . " You have no left-handed musician ! No one you can trust in your sleeping presence . " " Exactly . And you are acclaimed as the finest musician in Philistia . " " Oh , I would hardly make such a claim , " Huuo demurred . " There are many who ? " " Of your persuasion of hands . " Huuo nodded . " That , perhaps . But ? " " Tomorrow is the day of the festival , " Jaoch said . " I 'm sure the music will be as fine as the rest of it . But tonight I will ask you to play only for me . I would like to hear for myself whether you are as good as your reputation . " " Of course I will play for you , " Huuo agreed warmly . But behind the warmth was a chill . If he played as well as he could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might want him to stay here . But how could he ever play less than his best ? That simply was not his way . They finished the excellent meal , and Jaoch was a companionable host . But imperfectly concealed beneath that geniality was more than a hint of iron . At one point a subordinate entered with news of the capture of a wanted criminal . " Execute him this night , and leave his body for the birds , " Jaoch said , and continued eating without pause . The lord of the city was SHAME OF MAN 175  | perhaps deliberately showing the visitor two sides of himself : the best of friends , the worst of enemies . Then Huuo fetched his double flute , and played several melodies of increasing intricacy . He tried to restrain himself , to avoid the prettiest , but his nature would not allow it . Seren Jaoch was a very good audience , showing real appreciation for nuance as well as directness , and his responses led Huuo into his best . When Huuo paused , Jaoch made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he murmured , " and walk to the door as you do . See what you see in the adjacent chamber . " Perplexed , Huuo obeyed . When he came to the doorway , he saw seven or eight servants and guards standing there . When they saw him , they quickly dispersed , except for the one guard who was evidently supposed to be there . Huuo returned to his place as he finished the melody . " I saw your household staff , " he said . " So I thought . They overheard the music , and were compelled by it , and remained to hear it all . That was not by my command , so I know that their judgment echoes mine : if you are not the finest , you are surely close to it . Your reputation is well earned . " " Thank you , " Huuo said uneasily . " But I am keeping you up , when you need your rest for the morrow . If there is anything you wish for the night  --  fine wine , a soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said by some to be beautiful , and certainly she is to me . I live only to return to her . " Jaoch nodded approvingly . " In contrast to many musicians I see , who take this tour to revel in freedom from domestic constraints . Your attitude is like your music : excellent . " Huuo spread his hands . " If you saw her , you would understand , my lord . I thank you for your gracious hospitality . " He bowed , and stepped to the doorway . There a servant was now ready to guide him back to his chambers . When the musician was gone , Jaoch pondered for a time , then spoke , seemingly to the air . " Zebub , appear . " Another man entered the room from a door concealed by a hanging rug . He was of rugged build , with a certain cruel set to his mouth . " I see you are satisfied , my lord . " " I am indeed . He is even better than you claimed . A man of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was an incipient curl to his lip that hinted that his present company was not excluded from the generalization . Zebu ' ) took no seeming note of that contempt . " A man you can trust , unlike some , " he agreed . " You wish to add him to your court ? " 176 PIERS ANTHONY  | " Indeed . But he lives only to return to his beautiful wife . " " You may remember that I warned you of that , my lord . She is as lovely as he is talented . In fact she is a dancer , like my sister , and very like her in appearance . " " But your sister schemed against one of my favored men , " Jaoch reminded him grimly . " I had to banish her . " " I do not question that , " Zebub said quickly . " You acted as a seren must act . The lesson is exemplary . Yet I think she has taken it to heart , and you know I would like to have her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think she can persuade the musician to join this court ? " " In the right circumstance . " " Despite the fact that he has a wife who is by other accounts lovelier than she ? " " I think Scylla might  --  if the reward were sufficient . " " The reward of residence in this city , and acceptance by this court . " " Exactly , my lord . She loves her own people , and longs for the return of your favor which she forfeited by her indiscretion . " " I will consider . It is possible that I will not need her assistance . " " As my lord elects , " Zebub agreed . He exited quietly by the concealed doorway . Jaoch sat for a time , meditating . He would prefer to win the musician by positive means , but was prepared to go another route if that were required . Zebub , an untrustworthy but sometimes useful officer , represented that other route . And it was true that the man 's similarly untrustworthy sister also had certain qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaoch had seen her dance , and might at one time have taken her as a mistress , had she not schemed foolishly against the captain of his guards . She had evidently developed a passion for the man , or perhaps for the power of his position , but he had disdained her . She had tried to get him in trouble , and almost succeeded . It had been chance as much as vigilance that had revealed the truth . Then Jaoch had had to act , lest a bad example be set . But if there came a pretext to forgive her  --  well , she was still a tempting woman who perhaps had the potential to become interesting for his bed . And it was true that at times diplomacy could be greatly facilitated by the presence of an alluring and unscrupulous woman motivated to get the job done . Finally he rose and summoned his bedservants . Tomorrow would see what it would see . The other musicians were from all across Philistia , and were the best in their specialties . There were lyres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was faced with a tortoiseshell . SHAME OF MAN 177  | There were drums , including a melodious one from Egypt . There were zithers , including a delightful one in the shape of a crocodile from an unknown land to the east . There were harps , including a bow harp from Sumeria with a dozen taut strings . There were great brass cymbals , and a number of ornate tambourines . And of course there were flutes , including Huuo 's own double one . Huuo was delighted to be in this exalted company ' , for he seldom had opportunity to play with those who were as good in their specialties as he was in his . He had met some of the others before , but most were new . There were politics within music as well as within cities , so that a musician might be in favor one year and out of favor the next year . But he knew there would be no bad musicians among them , for no city wished to be shamed at the festival . The dancers were there too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them young and healthy and well formed , but there were some for the elder roles . They looked like ordinary folk without their costumes , but that would change at performance time . It was said that the combination of talented men and comely women made for an extremely enjoyable festival for some of the participants , quite apart from the honor of the occasion . And of course there were the historians , perhaps the most important members of this assemblage . Most of them were old men . Each had his own special aspect of the larger story , for this occasion , though of course all of them knew all of it . This was the occasion for the sharing of honors . They rehearsed in the morning at a palace annex , playing the familiar melodies of the festival . The historians told abbreviated versions , mainly setting the scene , and the dancers did relaxed walkthroughs . It was coming together . A feeling of camaraderie developed , with strangers smiling at each other , and sometimes a young woman would embrace or kiss a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pert bottom . This was the spirit of the festival . A girl approached Huuo . She was possibly the youngest and cutest of the dancers ; even in her deliberately drab day-robe the litheness of her body was evident , and her face was like that of a goddess who had not yet realized her power . " Your music is divine , " she said . " Do you have company this night ? I am Leda . " " I am married , " he said gently . " But this is the festival . Does your wife have this ? " She opened her robe to show him her full body within , blindingly close to nascent perfection . " I am also cursed . " " Cursed ? How so ? " " This is my hand . " He lifted his left hand . Leda laughed , her bare breasts rippling enticingly . " They would n't let you play if you were truly cursed . Seren Jaoch is n't cursed , is he ? I think it 178 PIERS ANTHONY  | would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a left side too , you know . " She stroked her left breast with her right hand . " Do you do it in mirror image ? " He had to laugh too . " No , there is only one of that part . But much as I would like to have a night with you , I must not risk it ; my wife can fathom thoughts . " " But she surely knows what the festival is like . Love does n't count , here . " Huuo did not want to offend Leda or hurt her feelings , because he would have to work with her for several days . Also , she seemed oddly familiar ; it was almost as if she had invited him to sexplay before , though that could n't be . So he finessed her offer . " You tempt me unmercifully . But I must not . But I think if you query that lyre player , he will not decline . I saw him watching you . " She sighed . " Very well . But know that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melodies . " She moved on to the lyre player , who was due for a pleasant surprise . Actually , what Leda had said was correct : marriage vows had no special force during the festival , and men and women could indulge as they pleased . Annai accepted that , as he accepted her right to do the same . But his marriage had not yet progressed to the point where he craved that type of variety . Before meeting Annai , he had had some flings , but the appeal of those had faded like flowers in a drought once he loved her . When he returned he would tease Annai about the delights he had passed up for her , and she would tease him about his foolishness . They understood each other . The musicians and dancers broke in due course for a light noon repast , none of them wishing to become weighed down with too much food and be clumsy for the presentation . Then it was time for the dressing and assembly , for the hour of the show was approaching . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a signal of their unity as a company , and of their confidence in the appeal of their bodies . Then they marched as a group to the temple of Ashtoreth , the mother goddess . The common folk of the city were already thronged . The nobles had seats set up in front , while the others packed in behind , filling the square and streets beyond . There was a roar of applause as the performers made their way through the aisle reserved for them and mounted the outer steps of the temple . It was a fine sunny day , which was just as well , because it would have been impossible to accommodate the crowd inside the temple . Seren Jaoch walked out in front as the performers found places on the steps and temple dais . " There will be wine for all at the palace gate after he ritual , " he announced , and there was a cheer . " And the temple will he open for worshippers . Let the performance begin ! " He went to take his seal at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said what was necessary . The first historian took the stage . The crowd went quiet , for all wanted to SHAME OF MAN 179  | hear . " It begins with a beautiful woman , " he said , his voice strengthening into a chant . " Her name was Helen , and she was of godly descent , the daughter of the king of Lacedaemon in the old country . " Now the dancer who had approached Huuo , Leda , walked out from behind a concealing column , in a diaphanous gown that masked yet enhanced her figure teasingly . Again Huuo almost thought he knew her , perhaps from when she had been younger , when she had not yet developed her phenomenal beauty of form and face . It seemed possible , for he had played at many events , and encountered many children and youths . The splendor of her maturity must have burst from the dullness of her cocoon in the past two years , fuzzing his recognition . The music started , first with a gentle background drum beat that matched the dancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huuo was the one assigned to that theme ; he played point and counterpoint on the double flute , catching the swing of her arms and body . Leda twirled and flashed a smile at him , perhaps hoping that they would get together on another day . " But Baal , chief of gods , spied her , and was intrigued by her beauty , " the historian continued . There was a murmur through the audience : only a dead man would not be intrigued by the seductive vision on the stage . " Fearing that Ashtoreth would observe , he masked himself by assuming the form of his other nature , that of the bull , and approached Helen . " Now the music of the harp came , augmented by that of the zither , as a dancer in a horned bull costume walked onto the stage , sporting a massive mock phallus . What followed was of considerable interest to the audience , despite the pantomimed distress of Helen and the piercing flute music that accompanied her attempted flight and struggles . That was of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like a graphic animalistic rape of a lovely girl to work up an audience . Three times the damsel almost escaped , to the alarm of the watchers ; but three times the bullheaded figure caught her and hauled her brutally back , bringing applause . He drew up her gown to expose her lovely body , turning it as she spread her legs so that everyone could have a fair view . Then the bull bore the damsel down on the pavement and pressed close to her in a dramatic rape , while the screaming flutes were dominated by the harp , zither , and intensifying drums . Both actor and actress did a fine job , making it look so real that even Huuo wondered . This was , after all , the festival , where such scenes could indeed be public . " Thereafter , " the historian resumed , after the commotion died down and the bull departed , " Baal abducted her and carried her away to a foreign city , where she lived in captivity and bore the bull 's calf . " Whereupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking the story through the Mycenaean expedition against her captors . The deeds of the heroes were given full play and dramatization , with suitably gory fight 180 PIERS ANTHONY  | scenes . Some of the heroes , instead of returning home , decided to settle in the backward lands they saw along the way , thus bringing civilization to the natives . Unfortunately some of the natives were not properly appreciative , notably the Egyptians , and treacherously counterattacked . They sneaked up and trapped the fleet in the Nile River , and fired dastardly arrows at the heroes from the shore , then barged in with grappling hooks and overturned the ships . The dancers formed the semblance of a ship , and tumbled as it overturned . The audience groaned appreciatively . The heroes of Philistia were able to beat them off despite their disadvantage , and keep possession of their fair new land . There was some thought of mounting a punitive expedition against the Egyptians , as they had before against the Trojans , but too many of their subtribes were more interested in consolidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main tribes focused on their territories , and buttressed the great leading cities of Gaza , Ashkelon , Ashdod , Gath , and Ekron . These cities soon begat daughter cities , forming trading communities and spheres of influence . They labored diligently to civilize the backward Canaanites and beat back the savage hill folk who called themselves Israelites . Such nuisances were chronic , but progress was being made . And so came to be the present community of Philistia in all its glory . The history play ended with a flourish of all the dancers jumping and whirling together , and all the musical instruments playing . The story of their culture had been presented once again , and the audience loved it , for all its familiarity . Then the exodus to the free wine at the palace began . A number of men headed instead for the interior of the temple , preferring to worship first in the arms of the attractive priestesses . There was more than one way to celebrate the occasion , and the re-enactments of the Helen story had surely whetted some appetites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way separately to the palace , where a private banquet was being prepared for them . Huuo discovered cute Leda walking beside him . " Are n't you with the lyre player ? " he inquired . " We have a date for the night , " she said . " But there is still the evening . You played just perfectly for me ; my emotions were in your melody . I would just love to give them back to you in style . Are you sure ? ? " He gave her a friendly goose , and she rode with it , smiling , though she desired a good deal more than this token familiarity . " Too much time with you , and I would forget my wife . I must not risk that . " " You have the quaintest way of turning a girl down . But there will be other days . " Leda smiled again and walked off , moving her hips provoca-tively . It was a good thing , he thought , that she had n't realized how effective her approach had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all too easy to sample . He probably should n't have goosed her , though courtesy SHAME OF MAN 181  | had required it ; her tight buttock was almost unbearably compelling . The emotion of the play had worked him up , making him prey to speculations he would normally have ignored . Next year he would have to see that Annai came with him . The banquet was excellent , and now the members of the troupe could eat and drink their fill , having completed their performance . Tomorrow they would be traveling to the next of the five major cities for their second performance . The complete tour would take ten days . Then they would be free to return with honor to their homes , having brought the festival to Philistia in proper fashion . As he sought to return to his chamber for the night , replete with a full belly and somewhat dizzy from the copious wine , a servant intercepted him . " Seren Jaoch would talk with you . " Huuo was not so dazed as not to feel a chill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , he would simply have to tell Jaoch no , as diplomatically as he could , and hope the lord did not take it too unkindly . Soon he was back in the private room , this time without food set out . Seren Jaoch greeted him in hearty fashion . " I trust you found the repast satisfactory ? " " More than satisfactory , lord , " Huuo agreed , rubbing his distended belly . " Your hospitality exceeds any elsewhere . " " I admired your playing today . Your flutes screamed so aptly for the maiden I almost thought it was her voice . You are excellent at more than melody . " " Thank you . It is a very special occasion . " " I would like you to join my court , to play for me . To be my chief musician . The style of life you have seen here would be yours throughout . " Now the crisis was upon him . " You are more than kind , lord . But my wife ? " " Your wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand she is a rare dancer . " " Yes . But her allegiance  --  our allegiance  --  is to our home city . Her family members , our friends  --  it would be very difficult for us to leave Mor . So while I very much appreciate your most generous offer , and have no wish at all to offend you by seeming ungrateful , I must say that I do n't feel free to accept it . " He braced himself for the likely consequence of his rashness in refusing this powerful man . But Jaoch merely smiled . " I understand . I would not wish to cause any distress for such an admirable musician . Go with my blessing , and if ever you change your mind , know that you will he more than welcome here in Gaza as long as I remain in power . 182 PIERS ANTHONY  | " I appreciate that very much , " Huuo said , vastly relieved . He had feared that it would not be safe to turn down the offer . " I shall certainly acquaint my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my expectation . " " Perhaps it will , " Jaoch agreed . " I wish you a good night , and a good continuing tour . I know they will appreciate you in the other cities as we have appreciated you here . " So Huuo found himself back at his chamber , his knees weak . Apparently his alarm had been for nothing ; the seren 's invitation had been complimentary rather that coercive . He knew that Annai would never have agreed to depart her dear home city . She loved to travel with him when they could , but always returned to their home . Her roots were there . And so , perforce , were his . No amount of good living elsewhere could make up for the slightest distress it caused her . It was dark in his room ; the servants must have been too busy with the banquet to attend him with a lamp . That was all right ; he had relived himself at the palace refuse chamber , and now was ready simply to sleep off his overindulgence . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a soft rounded body . " What ? ? " " Ah , you are back , " the dancer said . " Good . " " Leda , I told you ? " " The lyre player overimbibed , and finds himself not in condition tonight to perform as he had hoped . I am doing him the kindness of leaving him alone in his illness . So I am free to be with you after all . I thought perhaps ? " He would have to get rid of her again , and it was n't getting any easier , either as a matter of politeness or one of desire . " No . I am in reasonably poor condition myself at the moment . I must ask you to depart , much as I know I will regret this in the morning . " She sighed . " You 're a hard man to approach . " " No , I 'm merely wary of getting involved with a creature so luscious she would likely make me forget my music and embarrass myself at the next performance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , laughing as she got off his bed . " Bill if you should change your mind , just give me a signal , any time . " " What , in the middle of a performance ? " She laughed . " Not unless you want to put on the bull suit . Then , however ? " " No bull suit , " he said , lying down . " I am no Baal . " He heard her depart . Something about the encounter nagged him . He reviewed their dialogue as well as his somewhat wine-addled mind could , and managed to catch it : it was her comment about changing his mind . There were women who would be angry at being rejected , however politely , but she had merely acceded , perhaps being too young and nice to harbor SHAME OF MAN 183  | much outrage . His vague prior image of her was as a most persistent girl , but that was obviously false . She remained open to his interest , should he change his mind . Very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huuo had been surprised by amicable acceptances instead of ugly reactions . It was of course coincidence , and fortunate for him . Reassured by that realization , he slept . Zebub appeared at his lord 's summons . " You were right , " Jaoch said gruffly . " He declined . " " And the girl ? What 's her name , Leda ? " " Her , too . Three times today . She reports that even when he goosed her , his fingers did n't stray . The man is constant . " Zebub shook his head with wary appreciation . " I suspect he is the only man who ever turned that vamp down even once in a day . She looks so ? " " I know how she looks ! I confess my defeat . You told me that the usual methods would not prevail with this musician , and he has proved your point . In the process he has shown me that I want him more than ever , for once he pledges faith with me , he will never violate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I am baffled how you think your sister can prevail where 1 , eda failed . " " My sister is beautiful too , and more experienced , and she does not accept defeat as lightly as Leda does . Scylla can force a flush or a tear or a tremble of lip or hand at will . She can make her pupils grow large and innocent . She has a sense of timing and nuance that can lead a man opposite to the direction he thinks he is going . She can show flesh without seeming to that nevertheless incites instant hunger in a man . I myself feel guilty when I oppose her , though I know her tricks . Leda , in contrast , has not yet learned that that beauty must sometimes be buttressed by determination and cunning . She 's too nice . " " I 'm sure that is not a fault either you or your sister suffer from , " Jaoch said dryly . " She will in any event keep trying . But you do have your uses . Do what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution : no taint of it must adhere to me . The musician must never suspect that I had anything to do with it , other than being ready to receive him as supporter and friend . " Ile glanced sharply at the other . " You do understand the consequence of failure in this aspect ? " " The same as failure in the mission itself , " Zebub said grimly . " But we do n't expect to fail . We expect to bring Huuo willingly to this court , and receive the rewards of success . " " I would despise you more than I do , were you not at times so useful . " " And I would not serve you , were I not sure of the manner you honor a deal , whether positive or negative . " " How very nice that we understand each other so well , " Jaoch said with 184 PIERS ANTHONY  | irony . " But you shall have your price , if you succeed : appointment as my tax collector , and the return of your sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my lord . " " My respect for the musician is such that I almost hope you fail . " " I shall do my best to disappoint you in that . " Zebub made a halfmocking salute and departed . Jaoch remained alone for a time , as he had before . The man disgusted him in much the manner of a rotting fly-ridden carcass . But the musician was a treasure he simply had to have : highly skilled , and trustworthy by both hand and nature . He had not asked how Zebub 's sister Scylla hoped to change Huuo 's mind and bring him here , but he was sure it was no way he would have arranged himself . He wanted to remain innocent at least to this extent , lest the knowledge poison the association he hoped to have with Huuo . Crystalech was uneasy . " Something evil is afoot , " she told her husband Carverro . " I just know it . " " What , in the daylight ? " he asked , looking up from his fine metalwork . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city ? " " I do n't know , but I fear it . " " Then perhaps you should stay home today , Crystal , and not go to the market . We can get by . " She had given up correcting him about her name , and increasingly everyone was calling her by the abbreviation , Crystal . " No , today the hill folk bring in their cattle for sale and slaughter . I must be there to put in a bid while the meat is plentiful and cheap . Any other day I might skip , but not this one day of this month . " He nodded . " I had forgotten . You are right ; we would go hungry if we did not shop expediently . Then perhaps I should come with you . " " No , for then we would have to bring Desert Flower along , and she would be exposed to the danger . I will go alone , and be alert . " " As you wish , my love . " He had learned not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her premonitions became true . He had come from a hill tribe himself , and had abducted her as a lovely girl of the valley . But the men of her city had surrounded them before he could bear her away , sealing his fate  --  until Crystal had amazed him by claiming he was her lover on a tryst . She had saved his life , and married him , and even brought his aging mother to the city to live in comfort . From that time on he had been absolutely devoted to her , and never seriously opposed her will . And , she had to admit , she had made a good choice , for his talent as an artisan was now providing them with a secure if not wealthy life . His hill-folk ways had almost disappeared , and they had a fine lovely daughter itt Desert Hower And , she thought as she walked through the native quarter of the city SHAME OF MAN 185  | toward the market section , she had been fortunate in finding employment with a liberal Philistine family . Huuo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in fact they had welcomed Crystal much as they would a family member , and encouraged her to bring Desert Flower to play with their own children . So just as Crystal had won her husband 's complete devotion and loyalty by her actions toward him and his mother , so had her employers won her own respect and even love . They were good people , and never would she knowingly betray their interests . She was early for the bidding , perhaps hurried by her vague concern . Her husband tended to doubt her intuitions , but she did not ; something terrible was threatening . If only she knew what ! She crossed the market street and mall , seeking the shade of one of the trees that lined the public center . Beyond it she could spy the separate houses of the aristocrats and honored artisans ; their villas had the place of honor closest to the ceremonial center , with its temples and the residence of the seren . The Philistines held music in very high esteem , and Huuo was a very good musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home when Crystal was there , and Annai would dance , showing her children how to do it . Chipp was becoming a fair little musician , and Minah a dancer who would be a marvel when she was grown . Desert Flower , the same age , was learning to dance too , though of course she would never be allowed to do it in a Philistine ceremony , being Canaanite . She heard the tramping and lowing of the cattle , as they were driven into the city and along the street toward the market . The poor beasts did n't know they were to be auctioned and slaughtered . They would be fat from grazing the mountain pastures , and somewhat wild too , but the herdsmen and dogs would keep them in line . However , there were usually extra guards assigned to the section on cattle market days , bearing staves , just in case . Noise and staves could turn cattle back and set them milling , so that they did n't stray into the wrong section of the city . She did n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . It was a normal pre-caution . The crowd of prospective buyers was gathering . Crystal walked back that way . She would not get the first or best , but she would certainly be better off than those who waited for the cuts to be retailed by the greedy meat merchants . She did n't enjoy watching the actual slaughter , but it was the only way to be sure that an inferior carcass was n't substituted after the sale . Suddenly there was a stir on the street . Men shouted with dismay , and there was a scrambling as people tried to get out of the way . Crystal looked , and saw that the cattle were stampeding . Somehow the animals had been spooked , and the herdsmen were ineffective in controlling them . But the extra city guards should he ready . The cattle charged down the street , throwing off all restraints . It was as if 186 PIERS ANTHONY  | they had realized that this was their place of doom . Where were the guards ? Crystal still could n't see any . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle , screaming imprecations , unable to turn them back . Then she had to scramble for her own safety as the lead bull veered toward her . She got behind the trunk of a tree and saw the beast charge by , followed by the others . She , heard the screams of townspeople as they realized that the animals were out of control . Worse , this represented a breakdown of order . Immediately the criminals were appearing , using the distraction to rob unnerved people and break into houses to steal their valuables . It was a sad commentary on society that the moment there was any disturbance or confusion , the robbers and looters appeared . They were mostly Canaanites , she knew , claiming that they deserved anything they could get from the privileged conquerors . Yet the conquest had been 200 years ago ; it was no longer an issue . It disgusted Crystal to see depravity in her own people . Now fires were starting in the city , and she knew the cattle were n't setting them . What a disaster had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One fire was fairly close ; it must be one of the villas . Naturally they were among the first targets of the criminals . They robbed , killed , and burned to cover their traces . Fairly close ? Crystal felt an ugly chill . Her employers ' house was in that direction . Could it be ? Hoping it was not , but fearing that it was , she ran in the tracks of the stampeding cattle , looking for Huuo 's house . Of course it would be a terrible thing for any house , but especially for that one . Her premonition .. . She got a stitch in her side from running , and had to slow down , catching her breath . But she was already close enough to see that it was one of those houses . Dread surged ; the closer she got , the more certain it was that it was Huuo 's villa . She blinked her eyes , trying to make it some other house , but the terrible vision would not be shifted . At last she stood by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessly burning . Even if the fire crew arrived soon , it would be too late ; the fire was too fierce . The looters must have torched it in several places , to make it burn like this . Others joined her , confirming the worst . " Hill folk ! " they cried . " They came through after the cattle . We came out to try to fight them off , but they had already pillaged this house , and they saw us and ran on toward the city gate . " " But what of Annai ? The children ? " Crystal asked . " They were home today ; I know it . I was going to go there after I made my purchase . " A Philistine neighbor spoke . " They were there , " she said grimly , " fin . I consulted with Annai within the hour . " Her mouth grew tight . " Then where are they now ? " Crystal demanded , almost forgetting her SHAME OF MAN 187  | subservient place before the Philistine woman . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a terrible thing for them to find on their return ! " " Annai was schooling the children in protocol , " the woman said . " They were not going anywhere . " " But ? " Suddenly Crystal 's terrible premonition surged forth , almost overwhelming her . " They ca n't be in ? " The Philistine woman abruptly turned and walked rapidly toward her own house , her shoulders shaking . She did not care to show grief in front of people beyond her own household . Her Canaanite servant shook her head sadly . " No ! " Crystal cried . " They would n't stay in there ! " " Not if they lived , " the servant woman said . Crystal paused for a moment of utter horror . Then she leaped for the burning house . But two women intercepted her and hauled her back . They had evidently anticipated her reaction . " You ca n't help them , " one said . " The hill brigands must have killed them first . " " And set the fire to hide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out before they got away , so we know the crime . We saw them hauling rolled rugs of valuables . If we had had men to pursue them ? " " It ca n't be ! It ca n't be ! " Crystal screamed . But she saw the blaze , and knew the neighbors and servants were n't lying . They all knew and liked Annai and her children . None of them were as close to the family as Crystal , so they were more objective about it , but they were clearly appalled . When they were sure that Crystal would n't charge the fire again , they let her go . She collapsed to the ground , sobbing . " I should have been there ! At least to save the children ? " She must have stayed there for a time , for she saw that the fire had burned down , leaving only the stone ruin and mounds of smoking ashes . She was alone with her grief . The hill folk had entered the villa , killed the people there , stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torched the house , and run away . A crime of opportunity . The victims could have been anyone . And suddenly Crystal 's employer and best friend was brutally gone . Others would soon forget the matter , for these things happened . But how could Crystal ever forget ? She picked herself up and trudged wearily toward home , her mission of the day forgotten . All she could think of at the moment was a meeting she knew would come : with Huuo . What could she say to him , when he returned from his tour and learned of this ? The circuit of the festival was done . The troupe had returned to the city of Gaza and now was dispersing after a final banquet . Huuo knew he had put 188 PIERS ANTHONY  | on weight from all the excellent eating . It had been a good celebration ; he knew that all five cities were well satisfied . Now he was glad to be on his way home , his purse heavy with payment . Annai would be pleased . When he boarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned out to be the same one he had traveled on before . It was on its return trip from Egypt . Captain Ittai greeted him warmly . " Scuttlebutt has it that you charmed them all , " he said . " And won the heart of the loveliest dancer . " " Perhaps I charmed them , with the help of all the other musicians , " Huuo agreed . " But I did not touch the dancer . " " Come now , your secret 's safe with me . With the license of the festival , and a creature all women envy choosing you , you surely must have been man rather than fool . " " I surely was the fool , " Huuo said . " Perhaps I simply could not believe that her passion was true . " He lifted his left hand significantly . Ittai nodded . " Put that way , I comprehend your doubt . But what point would there have been in her insincerity ? " " None I can think of , " Huuo admitted . " That does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love my wife beyond all else . " " I think you are a man I would like to know better , " the captain said . " Perhaps we shall meet again , next year . " He moved on . The wind was good , and the ship made scheduled progress under sail . At noon they reached the port of Ascalon and put in for spot trading . And another Philistine boarded . A woman . Intrigued by this unusual appearance , Huuo stood to greet her . She lifted back her traveling hood and smiled . " Why , it 's the musician Huuo ! I never thought to see you here . " " The dancer Scylla , " he said , similarly surprised . " I did not know you were traveling ? " " Well , not by preference , " she explained . " But it seems my family has inherited a house in Mor , which we ca n't use , so I must go there to arrange for its disposition . At least that will leave us in a good economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the festival . " He was being polite , though she was an associate rather than a friend . He had encountered her during various events , and she was an excellent dancer with a fine body . But she had a brother who was of dubious repute , and she herself  --  well , he was not one to credit rumors . He was nevertheless somewhat wary of her , perhaps because she was a beautiful woman who had on occasion hinted by leer manner that she found him an interesting man . He had just been through that with Leda , and did n't care for more . " I was n't there . It seems that one of the serens objected to me . In any event , I could n't have danced , because of my injury . " She lifted her right hand , which was heavily bandaged . " What happened ? " There was n't much to do except talk with her , as they were the only two Philistine passengers on the ship , and the passenger SHAME OF MAN 189  | section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his tubby . And he had to admit that she was good enough company ; maybe he had misjudged her . " An accident during a dance . I took a tumble , and put out my hand to break my fall , foolishly . There was something sharp there . " She shrugged . " It will heal , eventually . Meanwhile I am having to learn how to use my left hand . Have you any idea how awkward that is ? " " You forget that I am left-handed . " Her eyes rounded . " Oh ! My apology . I did n't mean  --  I never brought  --  I meant no offense . " She colored , looking flustered . " No offense taken , " he said quickly . " I make no issue of it anyway . At the festival I used the double flute , which diminishes my apparent difference . " " You are kind . I did know you were  --  I simply forgot , being absorbed with my own state . Yet perhaps our meeting is fortunate for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the patience . " She smiled , looking very pretty as her flush faded . " I shall be glad to help in any way I can , " he said . " It 's no imposition . We have several hours of boredom before us anyway . What problem do you have ? " " Everything ! " she exclaimed . " The most trifling , simple things become so infernally clumsy . Things I have always known how to do , suddenly I ca n't do without botching them . I 've been spilling wine and  --  and I ca n't even tie my sash . " She indicated her trim midriff . Indeed , her sash was loosely knotted , and sagged . This was not a disaster , as it served mainly to enhance the contrast to her clothing , which sagged nowhere , but it was surely an annoyance to her . " If you will permit me ? " he said , extending his hands . " No , do n't do it for me , " she said quickly . " Show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is n't just the change of hands , " he explained . " It 's that you normally use two , and now have only one . Naturally it 's difficult . " " Oh , yes , that 's true . Still ? " " So let me tie it for you . There are other things that may be done single-handed . " He took hold of her sash , untied it , then retied it properly so that it was snug without being tight . In the process he was reminded that her body was in fine form . She was a dancer , of course , so her torso and limbs were slender and lithe . But there were differences in dancers , and furs was about as good a body as he had seen on any woman other than his wile . " ' Thank you so much , " she said , smiling with a somewhat endearing human relief . His prior mistrust of her dissipated ; she was a nice woman , now that he was interacting with her . She was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just being sociable . Now he saw that her hair was sloppily braided . She had concealed it 190 PIERS ANTHONY  | under the hood , but in the heat of the day she threw that back , and her fair hair fairly sparkled in the sunlight . But the braids were bad . So he redid those too , with her acquiescence ; that was another thing that normally required two hands . Her tresses were almost silken in their length and lightness , and quite clean . They spent the duration of the sailing reviewing and rehearsing the left-handed way of doing things . It was clear that Scylla would have to practice a good deal before becoming apt , by which time her right hand might heal , making it all for little . But she was trying hard , and making good progress . She was also extremely appreciative of his assistance . When the ship came into the port of Mor they were surprised to see another female passenger waiting on the pier to board . No , it was a Canaanite  --  in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably Annai had sent her to intercept him ; perhaps there was something he was supposed to bring home . But as the ship docked and he and Scylla walked the plank to the pier , he saw that Crystal 's mien was serious , almost gloomy . " What is it , Crystal ? " he inquired as he reached her . " Is something wrong ? " " Master , your house is burnt , " the Canaanite said . He was taken aback . " My house  --  there was a fire ? Then where is my family ? " The woman 's mouth opened three times before she got the words out . " They are  --  gone . Raiders  --  a stampede  --  looters  --  they come through and your house was on their route to the gate ? " Huuo felt an ugly chill . " What do you mean , gone ? Gone where ? " Crystal rolled her eyes heavenward . " Gone  --  to the gods . Master , I had to tell you , before you got there yourself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he asked , stunned . " Do you mean they are ? " He could not say it . The woman nodded grimly , tears flowing . " I saw the fire . No one came out from it . The hill folk  --  to hide their crime  --  they were gone before they could be stopped . " " Annai  --  the children ? ? " " Master , they are dead , " Crystal said , finally speaking the dread word . Huuo would have doubted it from any other source , but he had known Crystal for years , and trusted her . Her daughter Desert Flower was almost like his own daughter Minah . Crystal would never knowingly deceive him . She was the city 's most loyal servant , because she was also friend . He found himself holding her , sharing her tears , not caring what others thought of a Philistine embracing a Canaanite in public . He had been so eager to get home to his family , and suddenly it had been destroyed . Then he saw through his bleary vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propriety returned . " I apologize for this scene , " he said as they walked along the pier to the land . SHAME OF MAN 191  | " By no means , " Scylla said . " How could you have known ? But perhaps I can help . " " No , it is no concern of yours . Go and forget this unpleasantness . " But his ear heard his mouth , and was appalled at this seeming dismissal of the disaster of his life as " unpleasantness . " His formal self was honoring the rules of protocol , while his inner self was struggling to come to terms with what could not be accepted . An observer might have supposed that he did not really care about his family ; instead he cared so much that he could not express it , and could let only part of the grief out . " You have been kind to me , " Scylla said . " Allow me to repay the favor . You will need a house . Take mine  --  the one I am here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Huuo said . " I must not impose . But I thank you for your concern . " " But the house is empty , " she protested . " Use it until you can get another . Let me lighten this small portion of your burden , as you have lightened mine . " She lifted her bandaged hand . He started to protest again , but Crystal intervened . " Master , you need a house . You have so much else to concern you . If this lady is your friend ? " " An acquaintance , " Scylla said . " I am a dancer . I know  --  knew Annai , professionally . But I want to help . It will take a month to arrange the sale of the house , and it makes no sense to waste it when there is such need . Perhaps you , Crystal , can serve him there as you have done before . " " Yes , certainly , " Crystal agreed . " It is fortunate . " Huuo could not oppose her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of crisis . She could not assuage his grief , but she shared it , and that represented vital support . She also knew how to take care of him . I I is sensible mind , operating apart from his feeling mind , knew that she was vital to his survival right now . " Do as seems best , " he said . " I will hire a wagon , " Scylla said . " I will bring it here . " She hurried off . Time seemed both interminable and instant , depending on the focus of his consciousness . He was aware of the wagon , which held the three of them as well as its driver , as it bumped along the streets through the city . Then he stood before the ruin of his house . It was nothing but ashes settled around the projecting stone walls . Long shadows shrouded the interior and reached across the land beyond . It was clear that nothing had survived the conflagration  --  no furniture , no possessions , no people . They had probably , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; only their bones would remain . Those bones were undisturbed , because only the next of kin could handle them with honor for their spirits . Huuo would have them rescued and properly interred in due course . But not today , not this week ; it was more than he could face at the moment . ' then he was being conveyed by the wagon again , as the sun sank low in the west , until they stopped at an unfamiliar house . Crystal took him by the 192 PIERS ANTHONY  | elbow and guided him inside . There was a bed there , and he lay down , leaving the two women to handle the world ; he had to handle himself , if he could . He must have slept , for he dreamed : Of Annai , smiling . Of Chipp , running happily . Of Minah , her great round eyes seeming eerily knowledgeable . She had always related well to the spirits ; now she was a spirit herself . Perhaps she would be the one to communicate to him from the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was merely a picture , as were the other two . Evening faded into night . Scylla lit lamps and set them in the rooms of the house , and a candle beside the bed where Huuo lay . He got up to use the lavatory chamber , then sat on the bed , lacking ambition to do more . His dream extended part of the way into his waking state , and he thought perhaps Annai would appear , having taken residence in another house after the fire . She would come when she learned that he was back , and she would find him , and all would be well . At any moment he would hear the laughter of his children . Crystal would lead them here . But Crystal knew they were dead . Had known before he knew . Had had to tell him at the pier , to try to cushion his fall some to some slight extent . So the dream dissipated , and for a moment he mourned it . Illusion was better than reality , right now . Scylla entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some food for you , Huuo , " she murmured . " You must eat . " " I have no interest in food . " " You must be whole for the funeral . You would not want to dishonor the spirits of your loved ones , perhaps sending them astray . You must be ready to do their final honors . " She was right . Death was terrible , but death without honorable burial was worse . Those he loved were dead , but their spirits depended on him for guidance to the next realm . So , listlessly , he took the food she offered , and mechanically consumed it , unaware of anything else about it . Then he lay down again and wept himself to sleep . Crystal tuned in on the local news . The Philistines were in control of the land , but the Canaanites had their own gossip network that covered things few Philistines knew of . Such as exactly which of the master 's liaisons the mistress of a house knew about , and which she did not . Which temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their interactions . Which noble , in the guise of a visit to the temple , fornicated instead with a heifer , believing this form of worship to he holier than the other . Which lesser lords were skimming grain from the tallies of which greater lords . And where every Philistine , of any level , traveled , and fin what purpose , legitimate or illegitimate . The Canaanites knew , and did not SHAME OF MAN 193  | tell . Because if they did , their masters would realize that their supposedly dumb witnesses were dumb only in the presence of Philistines ; they shared everything with their own kind . That would be a disaster . Life was already hard enough without destroying their chief amusement : watching the follies of the masters . Most of the stories were routine . But some were not , for Crystal . She was especially sensitive to two threads of the ongoing tapestry of news : the background on Scylla , and the actions of the hill folk who had made the deadly raid on Huuo 's house . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juicy tales were told , and she wanted very much to know exactly who had destroyed her kind master 's life . Crystal 's loyalty went beyond death ; it extended to vengeance . Scylla , it turned out , had been exiled a year ago from her native Gaza because she had schemed to corrupt a left-handed noble by seducing him away from his wife . The seren had learned of it and banished her from the city . Since then she had lived alone in a daughter city , on the largess provided by her brother Zebub , who remained in the favor of the seren of Gaza . Occasionally she danced for someone 's party , receiving due pay . She was an excellent dancer who would have been in the festival but for her banishment . In exile she had done reasonably well for herself , economically , because of the finesse with which she rendered personal favors to wealthy men ; it was said that even the temple women could not match her in certain respects . But seven days ago she had abruptly bandaged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she had waited until boarding the ship on which Huuo traveled . There was no evidence that she had actually hurt her hand ; no Canaanite had been involved in that , as the lady had used no servant . It had been assumed by some that she lacked the wherewithal to afford a servant , but Crystal suspected otherwise . What happened to what she got from those wealthy clients ? Scylla certainly had n't wasted her resources in riotous living . The lady was good at keeping secrets , and perhaps knew that secrets were not secure with servants . So perhaps she had indeed taken a fall and hurt her hand  --  and perhaps not . Almost certainly her boarding of the ship was no coincidence ; she had known that Huuo was aboard it . So what was her interest in him ? What else but the man himself ! She had headed for the port city the moment the raid occurred . She had to have known that Huuo had lost his family , rendering him open for remarriage . He was a prominent musician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , she could surely live well , without suffering the indignities required by certain men . Huuo was known to be straight , in every sense other than his handedness ; he would be easy to accommodate . So she was capitalizing on her opportunity , giving no other woman a chance to attract his attention first . Crystal could n't really fault that , because the opportunities of women were limited , even Philistine women , and Scylla 's reputation was none too savory . She had to be sharp to 194 PIERS ANTHONY  | gain a good husband . And perhaps she would make him a good wife . She did seem to like Huuo ; Crystal had watched her without seeming to , and caught the way her pupils dilated when she gazed directly on him . She probably admired his music ; as a dancer she would know his skill . There was a certain sexual appeal to good music , and to those who made that music , and Scylla was by all accounts a lusty woman . But what of the house burning ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete control of their livestock  --  until suddenly the stampede had occurred . It had happened because they had abruptly incited it , then pretended to be overwhelmed by it . It had evidently been a plot to generate a distraction so that they could then pillage the city . Of course they knew that the guards would soon make their appearance , so the effort was fast and limited ; they had charged almost directly for the front gate , knowing that if it closed them in , all would be lost , especially their heads . It had been their fortune that there had been few guards in the vicinity at the time ; the guard captain had given most of them leave to sample grog , expecting no trouble . And Huuo 's house had been right along that exit line . They had pillaged it , without a doubt , and torched it , perhaps as a secondary distraction . But had it been chance that that particular house had been attacked , and so few others ? The hill folk had been seen carrying away items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as not to attract any more attention than they could afford . But there were wealthier houses in that vicinity . Had the raiders been unlucky in choosing a medium house instead of a rich one ? Perhaps . So Crystal kept following the news , trying to gain the exact identities of the hill folk , which was no easy task because they were neither Philistines nor Canaanites . And she continued to serve Huuo with utter loyalty . If she were ever able to complete the picture of his disaster , she would give him the information so that he could have the city guards make a punitive raid and execute the guilty hill folk . Vengeance was n't as good as prevention , but it was better than nothing . In the morning Huuo woke to find Scylla sitting beside him , fanning his somewhat fevered face . She was wearing a light smock whose filmy texture clung to her body , and her tresses hung loose around her shoulders . She was in dishabille , but was incidentally lovely . " You need not take such trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had not realized that she would be with him in the house , and attending him like this ; that was not the business of an unrelated Philistine woman .
