Last summer Atlantic salmon returned to the rivers of Newfoundland in numbers that have not been witnessed in many years . Thanks to a moratorium on commercial salmon fishing in Newfoundland 's offshore waters that began in July 1992 , netters have stopped intercepting salmon at sea before the fish could return to their natal rivers . For many years Newfoundland 's wild and beautiful salmon rivers attracted thousands of anglers each summer from the United States , Canada , and abroad . By the 1960s , however , the province 's salmon angling was deteriorating fast as commercial fishing decimated the salmon at sea . Through the 1970s and 1980s Newfoundland 's salmon fishing steadily worsened , and gradually anglers crossed Newfoundland off as a place to go for salmon fishing , despite the fact that the province has more than 160 major salmon rivers and traditionally produced more of these fish than all other provinces combined . By 1990 even the netters could not catch enough salmon to keep their industry alive . When the government announced a five-year moratorium on salmon netting in 1992 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept a government payoff and give up commercial salmon fishing forever . When the netting stopped in 1992 , the salmon were free to come home . And home they came . Sitting under the stars on a gravel bar beside the river , we listened to the three-part sounds of salmon jumping as they moved upstream . There was a slish each time a salmon sliced up out of the water , a smack as it crashed back , then a lingering splash as the broken water fell in behind the fish . The sounds were repeated again and again as new fish moved up , jumping in the tail of the pool , jumping once more in the middle , then giving us a goodbye jump at the head before passing on around the bend . " We are n't seed so many salmon in years and years , " our guide Bernie Besaw said quietly . " ' T is a wonderful thing that 's " appening . " It was late July 1993 and four of us were camping on the banks of Newfoundland 's picturesque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be caught , and 30-pounders were not uncommon back in the days before a half-century of excessive commercial netting killed off the runs of big fish , letting only salmon that were small enough to pass through the net mesh return to the rivers . " When Newfoundland banned commercial salmon netting last year , the salmon came pourin ' back into the rivers in numbers we could n't believe , " outfitter George Pike explained . " Last year we said , " Let 's wait an " see . Maybe this is too good to be true . ' But this is the second year , and here they come again , more fish than we 've seen since I was a young b'y . " That afternoon we had canoed to the Serpentine 's Big Falls where Bowater Paper Co. once operated a posh salmon fishing lodge to entertain customers . The lodge is gone now , but the falls still tumble and roar , and impressive numbers of big salmon once again leap the falling waters and rest in the clear pools and runs below the falls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool while schools of smaller salmon circled . After a shore supper that first evening , Duncan Barnes and I each hooked large salmon in the pool where we were camped . My fish took a small Green Highlander on its first swing over him , gave us one good look at him , and then broke loose . " Ye ai n't permitted t " kill big salmon , but ye do n't " ave to release " em that soon , " Bernie chuckled . Moments later , just as the moon rose above the peaks of the barren mountains that surrounded us , Barnes said , " There 's one , " and we turned to see his rod plunging and a salmon the size of a man 's leg cartwheeling through the air , a good 3 feet out of the water . Ten , twelve times the salmon flung itself into the air , wrenching and heaving and throwing water . " Lookit him jump , b'ys , " Bernie exclaimed . " If " e stays in the air like that we 'll " ave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet ag'in " for we let " im go . " Barnes landed that fish as darkness fell , a husky 35-inch , 17-pounder that he revived by holding the fish in the current , head upstream , until the sturdy salmon tore free from his grasp and charged away . Next morning we fished the pool again and took five grilse ( small salmon that have returned after spending only one year at sea ) . These were hard-hitting , bright fish , fresh from the saltwater . They weighed 3-1/2 to 4-1/2 pounds and George and Bernie were quick to point out that none had net marks on them . As Barnes and I moved on to another camp , a fellow working in a gas station in Daniel 's Harbor told me he had filled his eight grilse tags early in the season , but still went fishing on Portland Creek every evening after work . " I fishes from 6 to 9 every evenin ' ' , " he said , " an " rare is the night I " ooks an " releases less than four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer of 1993 Newfoundland received more rain than in any year since 1947 , and the rivers ran bank full late into the summer . Conditions were perfect for the salmon , which ran straight through to the spawning beds without being stopped by impassable obstructions , but the high water made it more difficult for anglers because the salmon were not holding for long in any given place . When a fish came for a fly but did n't take , it often moved on rather than returning to its previous position and giving the angler time to make repeated casts over the same fish . Once on Harry 's River when I raised a good salmon that did n't take the fly , I waited a moment , meaning to rest the fish and then cast to it again . But Bernie Besaw would have none of that . " Cast where he 's to whilst he stays where he 's at ! " Bernie commanded from the midstream rock on which he sat while coaching my endeavors . " Flick it to " im ag'in " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry 's is a small river with a reputation for producing very big salmon . In the old days George Pike 's father used to take sportsmen up the Harry 's on the old Newfie Bullet train , then carry them by canoe back downstream to Stephenville Crossing , camping and fishing all the way . Twenty- and 30-pound salmon were common then . Now much of the Harry 's is accessible by vehicle , and George Pike and his energetic wife , Odell , operate two salmon fishing lodges there . Their gracious , newly acquired Dhoon Lodge stands on the banks of the Harry 's River , just 8 miles upstream from the sea , and migrating salmon pass by throughout the season , often pausing in the two long pools that join the property . The Pike 's Log Cabin Lodge is a more rustic camp on Spruce Brook , a tributary of the Harry 's . George and Odell built the camp for moose and bear hunters , but when the salmon returned , opened it for fishing season as well . From these central locations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of Newfoundland 's finest salmon fishing near at hand . They guide guests on the Harry 's , Serpentine , Lower Humber River , Flat Bay River , Barachois River , and Southwest Brook  --  all excellent salmon producers . Don and Rod Stowe were strictly moose and bear hunting outfitters with a main camp on Adies Lake in the heart of the primary spawning grounds for salmon ascending the mighty Humber River . Until 1992 the Stowes had not considered opening for salmon fishing because there were n't enough fish , but when the moratorium on netting was declared , the Stowes suddenly found themselves surrounded by more large salmon than they had seen in over twenty-five years . The five spawning tributaries that feed Adies Lake filled up with salmon in 1992 , and the Stowe 's moose and bear hunters were treated to the sight of schools of big fish finning in every pool . Salmon rolled and jumped in the lake in front of the Stowe 's camp , and schools of big salmon could be seen rolling at the mouths of the tributary streams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camp and went into the salmon outfitting business just as record runs of salmon came up the Humber River and ascended Adies Stream to reach Adies Lake . Accustomed to using a helicopter to transport moose hunters , the Stowes include helicopter service in their salmon outfitting venture , too . " In minutes we can carry fishermen to pools on the Humber River that take hours to walk to , " Don Stowe told us . " We can reach lots of places that very few people ever fish . " After breakfast at camp we boarded the helicopter and hopped over to a remote bend on the Humber River where salmon rose and jumped before us all day . There was a steady parade of salmon and , although it was raining and the river was running high and making wading difficult , we each took several large grilse on the popular Orange Bug dry flies . " Large salmon are " ard to catch when there 's so many grilse about , " Rod Stowe commented . " The grilse are quicker to take the fly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and large salmon produce offspring genetically inclined to stay at sea for several years before returning to their natal rivers as large salmon . " By killin " only grilse and releasin ' all large salmon , we 're makin ' sure the big salmon all gits to spawn and produce more like " em , " Rod Stowe explained . In central Newfoundland the big Gander River runs for 37 miles without road access from the village of Glenwood on the Trans-Canada Highway to Gander Bay . Here the low hills that surround the river are forested with pretty white birch and aromatic balsam fir , and the river tumbles through several big granite-ledged rapids , then flattens out in long steadies with smooth gravel bars and broken stone bottom . Private cabins that can be reached only by boat peek out from the trees , and women with children pick berries along the banks while their menfolk fish for salmon from the graceful white 25-foot fir-planked Gander River boats built by local craftsmen .

UNQUESTIONABLE NUMBERS * Although reports of " more fish than ever " were heard all over Newfoundland in 1993 , only a few of the province 's 160 salmon rivers have accurate fish counting facilities . Here are the official comparative counts for several rivers which give a clear picture of how prodigiously salmon runs have increased since the netting moratorium was declared in 1992 .

Several of the boats anchor across the shallow bars at the top of each ascent , their occupants sweeping the reachable water with flies . Other anglers wade the edges , casting to known lies where salmon sometimes pause and become interested in passing flies .

Most of the fishermen know each other and comments fly back and forth between the boats as runs of salmon come past . The Gander is known for blocky , extra-heavy grilse and large salmon that are particularly heavy for their length . My first Gander River grilse was a 5-1/4-pounder that was only 21 inches long . Barnes later caught an 8-1/2-pound salmon that measured only 25 inches . " Full-figured fish , " Danny Stiles called them . We caught these fish 27 miles upstream from the sea , yet they still had sea lice on them , indicating that they had been in freshwater less than 24 hours and had traveled that distance upriver in that short time . " Shows how fast they 're moving up , " Terry Cusack commented . " Not taking time to stop at all . " With so many fish passing through , it was only a matter of time before one took your fly . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned its broad side to the strong current and took off downstream , peeling line from the reel in a staccato screech punctuated by gut-wrenching leaps and heavy splashes . Even the grilse were strong enough to run out of control on that heavy flow of water . We had to hoist the anchor and chase the fish downstream and try to land them in the long " stiddy " below . " With this many salmon in the river , just think what the fishing will be like two and three and four years from now when the offspring from this year 's spawning return , " Terry Cusack observed as we sat on the bank of the Gander that last evening . " Our prospects have n't looked this good in many , many years .
