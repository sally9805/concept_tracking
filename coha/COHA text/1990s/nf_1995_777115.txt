Part One // The View From the Tenth Circle // These population dynamics will result in the " browning " of America , the Hispanization of America . It is already happening and it is inescapable . //  --  HENRY CISNEROS , // former mayor of San Antonio , Texas ; Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in the Clinton administration // My grandparents came from Lebanon . I do n't identify with the Pilgrims on a personal level . //  --  DONNA SHALALA , // Secretary of Health and Human Services in the Clinton administration // We are transforming ourselves . . . //  --  DORIS MEISSNER , // Commissioner , U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service in // the Clinton administration ( who approves ) // Dante , the great poet of medieval Italy , would have been delighted by the Immigration and Naturalization Service 's waiting rooms . They would have provided him with a tenth Circle of Hell to add to the nine degrees of damnation he described in his most famous work , the Inferno. // There is something distinctly infernal about the INS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mutually incomprehensible in virtually every language under the sun , each clutching a number from one of those ticket-vending machines which may or may not be honored by the harassed INS clerks before the end of the civil service working day . // The danger of damnation is low  --  sort of . A Scottish friend of mine did once find himself flung into the deportation holding tank because the INS misunderstood its own rules . And toward the end of my own ten-year trek through the system , I whiled away a lot of time watching confrontations between suspicious INSers and agitated Iranians , apparently hauled in because the Iran hostage crisis had inspired the Carter administration to ask just exactly how many of them there were enrolled as students in U.S. universities anyway . // ( The INS was unable to provide an answer during the hostage crisis 's 444 days . Or , as it turned out , at all . 1 ) // You can still get a pretty good blast of brimstone , however . Try suggesting that it might be another of those misunderstandings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you are ordered by the clerk to go away and come back another day with a previously unmentioned Form XYZ . // Your fellow huddled masses accept this treatment with a horrible passivity . Perhaps it is imbued in them by aeons of arbitrary government in their native lands . Only rarely is there a flurry of protest . At its center , almost invariably , is an indignant American spouse . // The Great American Immigration Paradox // We are looking here at something crucially significant : the Great American Immigration Paradox . Just as New York City 's government ca n't stop muggers but does a great job ticketing young women on Park Avenue for failing to scoop up after their lapdogs , U.S. immigration policy in effect enforces the law only against those who obey it . // Annual legal immigration of about I million  --  counting the 100,000 refugees and the 100,000 applying for political asylum  --  is overwhelmed by an estimated 2 to 3 million illegal entries into the country in every recent year . // Many of these illegal entrants go back home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border every day , But , year by year , the number of illegal immigrants who settle permanently in the United States grows . Here 's how to think about it : if you balance the gross illegal immigration against gross departures of illegals , you find the net increase in the illegal immigrant population . A cautious INS estimate : this net illegal immigration has been running at about 300,000 to 500,000 annually . 2 No one , however , really knows . // The INS bureaucracy still grinds through its rituals . But the reality remains as President Ronald Reagan described it in 1983 : " This country has lost control of its borders . " // " And , " Reagan added , " no country can sustain that kind of position . " 3 // Indeed , the loss of control is even more complete than Reagan suggested . Much of the current legal immigration ca n't be kept out either . The majority of those lost souls in the INS waiting room will find salvation , in the form of U.S. residence , in the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a half and two thirds  --  are accepted more or less automatically under the various family-reunification provisions of current U.S. law . // Then there are refugees , who apply for admission while they are still abroad , and political asylum seekers , who apply once in the United States . And , similarly , the weird workings of the American legal system have made it virtually impossible to expel asylum seekers once they land on U.S. soil . // In fact in early 1993 another immigration scandal erupted : it emerged that foreigners were getting off planes at New York 's John F. Kennedy Airport at an annualized rate rising rapidly through 15,000 , applying for asylum and , because of lack of detention space , being released into the United States on a promise to present themselves at a future hearing , which not more than 5 percent ever did . 4 ( Not that it matters if they do . An unofficial INS estimate is that eight out of every ten asylum applicants end up staying in the United States quite regardless of whether or not their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expel asylum seekers once they set foot in the United States is why both the Bush and Clinton administrations were forced to order the interception of boats carrying would-be illegal immigrants from Haiti on the high seas . And it 's why the Clinton administration had to beg humbly that the Mexican government halt and return home shiploads of smuggled Chinese . // As invariably happens with immigration policy , what was intended ( or at least alleged ) to be kind turns out to be cruel . We will be returning to this theme later . // Naturally , I take a deep personal interest in these immigration idiosyncrasies . After all , as it turned out I could have avoided my INS decade simply by ignoring the law and staying here after I graduated from Stanford University Graduate School of Business in 1972. //
