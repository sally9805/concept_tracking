Infrastructure does n't appear in my trusty old 1949 Random House Dictionary . But there is an entry for the prefix infra- , meaning " below " or " beneath . " So infrastructure is the structure below , and you know what that means in terms of public awareness : Out of sight , out of mind . Politically , it has meant let 's not spend tax dollars on work no one will see . It 's not till a bridge falls into a river that we even think about what 's holding it all up . And now , suddenly , we hear that not five or 10 or 100 bridges are unsafe ; the number is in the hundreds of thousands in the United States alone ! We can no longer hide from the problem . Our infrastructure must be maintained in spite of our short attention spans , and the work now needed promises to be the greatest project of the next 50 years . We know how to rebuild America 's infrastructure , how to accommodate our almost mindless growth . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the needed work force . We have the materials . We 'll find the money . The only question remaining is whether we will replace our infrastructure with the same short-lived , land-destroying , boring , and often ugly structures or with long-lived , land-restoring , benign , exciting , and beautiful ones . The way things look is often an indication of what we value . You can see at a glance what we as a society care about . The deterioration of America 's infrastructure expresses our don't-bother-me-now attitude . If we retain that attitude when we rebuild , you can imagine the results . Part of the problem lies in the fact that we have n't yet imagined a better future . Simply replacing unsafe bridges or rebuilding the railroads  --  as necessary as it is  --  would be pouring good money after bad . Do we want to be in the same mess again 30 or 40 years from now when all the replacements start to fail ? Or is there a whole new way to live on this planet ? Are human beings and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we , so long estranged from the world that produced us , learn to live as gently , as gracefully , and  --  with great good luck  --  as beautifully here as do all the rest of the world 's creatures ? We do n't need studies or computer models , printouts or water samples , to see that we should not be building almost everything on the earth 's tender skin . By letting our structures hog all the sunlight wherever we go , we stamp out much of the natural riches of our land . Weather is not kind to building materials . They need to be protected by a blanket of earth . Otherwise , ice cracks the freeways , water rusts bridge structures , floods rage because water can not soak into impervious ground . Everything is built the way it 's built because life on Earth has so far never been the number-one issue in the minds of us who build . The images shown here are just a few longer-lasting , less-harmful alternatives . * Bridges . The worst thing about a bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all manmade structures : It is a land-killer , a dead footprint on land or water . To last for centuries , to provide a sheltered roadway , to serve all creatures , and to present a living surface to the sky , a bridge must have a roof and a deep covering of earth . An earth-covered bridge ? " That 's nonsense , " you say . " Next thing you know he 'll be proposing underground airports . " Yes , and more ! * Airports . The question of how to design an airport appreciate for the future can be answered as follows : ( 1 ) Build huge , high , roofed-over spaces , ( 2 ) allow for floor-to-floor heights of 10 feet or more indoors , and ( 3 ) pull a blanket of earth over the whole thing . Otherwise , the acres of imperious runways and grass needed for airports will continue to blight the earth . If planes are ever able to rise vertically from the terminal , the runways can be torn up and the huge open flatlands can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " We will now kill all other living creatures by creating dead cities and pave surfaces . " It just happened . We took one small step , and then , seeing little damage , took another . And that 's exactly the way we will undo it all : step by step , until the land is returned to trees and grasses , eagles and wildflowers. * Railroads . " The wrong side of the tracks " is underneath . A cemetery of crushed earth lies below the rails . Railroads cover the land with lines of lifelessness . Trains will continue to be land-killers unless we put them in the one place that is really right  --  underground . * Parking . Parking lots such as those at shopping centers , churches , and sports arenas are wasteful and destructive . Some stadium lots smother vast areas of land and yet may be used as seldom as once a month ! A handsome structure that kills land is an enemy , and we are only now slowly coming to realize it . If a structure is kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its very appropriateness be both appealing and beautiful . ABOUT THE AUTHOR Malcolm Wells is an architect specializing in underground designs .
