The topics on The Jenny Jones Show run along standard daytime lines : sex , divorce and dieting . But unlike her more seasoned rivals on the syndicated gab-show circuit , comedian Jones , 45 , is known for her gentle approach . Her six-month-old-program , in fact , grew out of her popular 1990 nightclub comedy act , Girls ' Night Out , in which she held forth on such gender-specific topics as leg waxing , stretch marks and PMS . But for Jones , one contemporary female problem was too close for comfort . Eleven years ago this May , Jones underwent a breast-implant operation to increase her bust line and bolster her self-esteem . But , like up to 15-20 percent of the estimated 1 million women in the U.S. who have implants , Jones ended up with lasting side effects . Her implants hardened , and vainly hoping to end her discomfort , she had them surgically replaced five times . " My body just rejects implants , " says Jones , who is angry , bitter and still confused about what medical steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I have silicone in my body , but there seems to be no way to undo it . " Following last month 's revelation by the largest U.S. implant producer , Dow Corning Corp. , that health risks associated with breast implants may have been known for 20 years , Jones has decided to go public with her story for the first time . ( None of her implants were made by Dow Corning ) . " I was always made so aware of my chest , " says Jones , who was born Janina Stronski and grew up in London , Ont. , with her sister , Elizabeth , now 47 , in a strict Catholic household run by her Polish immigrant parents , Sophie and John . " I was teased when I was younger because my chest was too flat , " says Jones , who left home at 17 , renamed herself Jenny Jones and took off to play drums with a rock band . In 1971 she worked as a backup singer for Wayne Newton , and two years later she formed her own dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage to record-company executive Buz Wilburn broke up in 1980 , she devoted herself to her other performing passion , comedy , and began playing amateur clubs at night . In 1986 she became the only woman to win the $100,000 comedy grand prize on Star Search . She now lives in Chicago , where The Jenny Jones Show is taped . Jones maintains a long-distance relationship with her boyfriend of six years , Denis McCallion , a production executive at Walt Disney Television in . L.A. " Jenny has been carrying this trauma for years , " says McCallion , " and I think that talking about it is a catharsis . " Jones , who told her story to Chicago bureau chief Giovanna Breu , agrees . " Now I am free , " she says . " I have nothing to be embarrassed about anymore . " Unfortunately , my father was a breast man . My mother and my sister , Elizabeth , were big-breasted , but I was destined to be flat-chested . My father would tell me to rub cold water on my chest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I do certain exercises to make my breasts grow . I sent away for that Mark Eden breast developer  --  at thing with a spring that was in the back of all the magazines in the 1960s . I even had rubber falsies ! My parents had immigrated to Canada from Poland after World War II . In Poland they stood in bread lines for food , and when they came to Ontario , where I grew up , they had nothing . My mother was a dressmaker , and they opened a little bridal shop that wound up being a very successful business . My father , who died in 1989 , appreciated women and clothing and helped design some of the wedding dresses . After my parents divorced in the late 1950s , my father married Roula Frangos , a dressmaker who worked in his store . I remember one compliment he gave my stepmother some 10 years ago . He said , " The most wonderful thing about my wife here after all these years is she has great boobs . " My parents did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cute to talk about how flat-chested I was . They did n't realize how much damage they were doing . I did n't realize until much later . It did n't help that I went through puberty in the big-breasted Jayne Mansfield era . Later , in my 20s , when I was a backup singer for Wayne Newton , I was always the target of small-breast jokes . People gave me T-shirts with fried eggs . In those days , I could n't even wear a size 34A bra . I had a closet full of padded bras . Sometimes I would hurt myself pushing up whatever I could possibly get to come up with cleavage . Although I did not date a lot because I was insecure , I did marry at 23 . I was married twice . In 1969 , when I was engaged to my first husband , Al Gambino , a musician , I would look at sexy nightgowns and lingerie and think that I could never wear them . That marriage was the kind of mistake that people make when they 're young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I realized how uncomfortable I still felt about my body . My husband seldom touched my breasts when we were intimate . I could only assume that they were not big enough or attractive enough for him . When that marriage split up in 1980 , I was living in Los Angeles , working as an office manager . I thought that only celebrities had breast implants until one day a coworker told me that she had them . She was so excited about hers that she took me into the ladies ' room and took off her clothes to show them to me . I went to the Beverly Hills plastic surgeon that she recommended . He was n't board certified plastic surgeons need not be board certified to practice , but he was affordable . I asked if there were any dangers . He said that about 10 percent of women who have implants develop hardness but that there was a new silicone implant made by the McGhan Medical Corp . that prevented a lot of that . Besides , he said that if I developed hardness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was like buying a car with a one-year guarantee . I said , " How soon can we do it ? How much does it cost ? " He said , " $1,500 . " I had a garage sale and sold practically everything I owned to pay for those implants . I sold my sewing machine , books , pots and pans , clothes . There was nothing anyone could have done at that point to talk me out of it . I could not sleep at night . I said , " Please , let the day come . " I had my first operation on May 15 , 1981 . It was outpatient surgery . The first thing I remember was that when I looked down , I could not see my waist anymore . I felt terribly sexy because I still had feeling and sensation in my breasts after the first operation . It was such a big change . I think my doctor made my breasts bigger than they should have been for my frame  --  I 'm 5 ' ' 6 " , 130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When people did double takes , I did n't know if they were thinking , " Nice body " or " She did n't have those last week ! " A week after my surgery , I was still black-and-blue and still had stitches , but I went out to buy a real woman 's bra , size 36C . I could n't wait . I have to admit , though , that it was disconcerting to see men talk to me and look at my chest . That had never happened before . After about six months , my right breast got hard . I knew that was one of the complications , so I was n't surprised . But there I was with one soft breast and one really hard one . One insensitive male acquaintance told me when I hugged him goodbye , " What do you have , rocks in there ? " I was mortified . My implants certainly cut down on my relationships . I was so self-conscious that if I met anyone and wanted to kiss him , I had to tell him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was embarrassing . But I kept my medical problems secret . It turned out that hardness is very common  --  and my doctor was wrong when he told me in 1981 that only 10 percent get it . On May 10 , 1982 , a year after my first operation , I went back to the surgeon to have my implants replaced . He waived his fee , as he had promised . He used the same kind of implant but made them a little smaller to see if it made a difference . It did n't . Within five months , my new implants started to get hard . In December of 1983 , I went back to the doctor . I did not think to get a second opinion . I had heard about other women with hard breasts , so it did not seem that unusual . He gave me general anesthesia and squeezed the implants to break up the capsule that was forming around my implants and make my breasts soft again , which was not an unusual practice at the time . Manufacturers now warn that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't work . I was still in Los Angeles , and by now I was working in comedy clubs . I started reading about a silicone implant with a polyurethane coating that preserved softness . It was called the Meme . I went back to the surgeon and asked for it . I had my third implant operation on Dec. 19 , 1983 . This operation , like the others , was very painful and left embarrassing scars around both nipples . Worst of all , the problem was not corrected . At one of my checkups , I told the doctor that my implants were getting hard again . He said , " Vogues are n't supposed to do that . " I said , " They 're not Vogues , they 're the Meme . " He told me he had put in a Vogue another polyurethene-coated silicone implant instead because he thought it would be better for me . This doctor was in a beautiful building in Beverly Hills , highly recommended , and he had never told me that he was n't putting in the Meme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic who was a dirt bag . I was standing at the rail watching the other comedians , and he put his hand up my blouse and grabbed my breasts . By this time , all the feeling in my breasts was gone , so I did n't even know it ! That was one of my worst moments . On Aug. 13 , 1984 , my doctor put in the Meme implant , which was later voluntarily recalled by the manufacturer because of possible cancer risks . I went home after the operation , and there was swelling , which did not go down . A week later I had to have surgery to stop internal bleeding . The Meme implants got hard too . But I lived with them from 1984 until 1991 . I resigned myself to the fact that my breasts were n't ever going to be soft . It is just something about my body that causes this . Then , as I got into my 40s , gravity began taking its toll . One breast pointed downward a little bit , one pointed up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-cut because my breasts did n't match . In 1985 I met my boyfriend , Denis McCallion . It was so hard to tell Denis about my implants . I must have postponed it for a month . I thought he would never look at me the same way . I know he liked my shapely figure . He found me attractive because of what he saw at the beginning . I said , " I 've had breast implants , I have had some complications , they do n't feel very natural , they do n't look particularly attractive . " He said , " So what ? " Denis urged me to go to some kind of counseling , but I never did because that would n't make the implants go away . I did a photo session in 1986 wearing a bustier , and every picture had a ridge line on my right breast . The photographer asked where it came from . I knew that it was n't noticeable to the eye , but the camera had picked it up . It was embarrassing . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later found out that it was silicone in my tissues . Between 1985 and 1991 , I went to one doctor after another  --  all men  --  asking , " Is n't there something you can do ? " They all told me , " Be glad this is all that is wrong with you . Some women 's breasts are as hard as cement . " What I did n't learn until all the recent publicity about the dangers of breast implants was that some women get collagen diseases , rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders . A year ago I went to another doctor who told me about a MISTI GOLD  --  a new implant filled with a nonsilicone polymer  --  that had been successful with people who have a history of hardening . He said , " Your breasts can be 50 percent softer . " I said , " That 's good enough for me . " By now I was commuting from Los Angeles to Las Vegas doing a test run of The Jenny Jones Show . Denis tried to talk me out of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of implants in Beverly Hills on March 1 , 1991 . When I went in for a two-week checkup , I had a red splotch on my chest . The doctor said that the old implants had ruptured and the splotch could have been a reaction to the silicone . He could n't tell me how long ago this had happened . He gave me antibiotics and an antihistamine . It took four weeks to go away . In a couple of months , the MISTI GOLDS hardened too . My breasts were completely numb , and the ridge on the right breast was more prominent . I was giving up . A month ago I went back to the doctor . When I asked him if the silicone ridge was dangerous , he said , " We do n't think so . " I told him that I really want my implants out . I do n't care what my breasts look or feel like . I want them out of my body . I hate them . It was the worst mistake I ever made . The doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will be suicidal in two weeks . " Even more recently , another surgeon told me , " You ca n't take out the marble from marbled beef . To get all the silicone out of your body , we would have to take out some of your tissue . " It would be reconstruction , and that would create a substantial deformity . My other option would be to have a saline implant , which has a silicone shell . But I do n't want silicone in my body . I am in an unfixable situation , and I have no idea what to do . Now both breasts are hard and I have scars . I do n't have to wear a bra because my breasts hold themselves up . I wear one at home , though , because I do n't want to look at my breasts . I hate my body a thousand times more now than I ever did before . I would sell everything I own to be able to have the body back that I gave up . Denis has been incredibly supportive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never would have had these implants done . He loves me for what I am . But nothing he can say can make a difference . I still have not told him that I do n't have feeling in my breasts , and we have been together for six years . It 's as though any kind of sexual activity comes to a complete halt when I am touched above the waist . I am the most unsexy person in the world in my mind . I am proud of my work , but when I get fan letters from men who think I am so sexy , my reaction is , " If they only knew . " Now that I 'm going public , I feel that a great weight has been lifted from me . I will be able to hug somebody and not wonder if he or she is thinking , " Oh , my God , what are these ? " I want to urge other celebrities to come forward . If they 'll talk about it , we can start doing some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering implants : Do n't do it . It 's not worth the risk . Learn to love yourself . If I could have learned that , I would n't have had to suffer these 11 years of torture . <p>
