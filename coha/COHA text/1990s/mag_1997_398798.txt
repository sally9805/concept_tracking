What started as a parent 's careful , clinical notes on his newborn grew into a trove of precious memories BY JOHN COYNE // WHEN OUR FIRST AND ONLY child was less than a week old , we started keeping a journal about him . At first it was more like notes for our own benefit-sleepy midnight scribbles about how long he 'd been awake , how much of his bottle he 'd drunk . In those first few weeks of his life , we even got down to recording his poops , the color as well as the frequency . It was obsessive , but we were new and inexperienced parents . We 're also the kind of people who are inclined to keep records , to make things permanent on paper . Perhaps we also deluded ourselves , hoping that this would give us at least some control over our son 's first days . In keeping track of his eating , sleeping , and excreting , we generated a five-page , single-spaced account that we helpfully brought to John 's pediatrician on our first monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby doing ? " we handed it over . He studied the report for a moment , turning the pages in obvious wonder , then looked across his cluttered desk and said gently , " You 'll want to keep this . " Soon I shifted my loose note taking to my computer , and when I sat down to work every morning , I 'd type out a few comments about John-his behavior , his moods , and when he began to talk , what he had to say . Now , several years later , I find myself looking back on those old journals and discovering episodes I had forgotten , small incidents that give me clues to who he was , and maybe even who he 's becoming . There is a note I made when John first started to crawl . I had given him his bottle one evening while my wife was cooking dinner . His bedroom door was partially open , and a shaft of light came into the room from the kitchen . Finishing his bottle , John stirred himself , climbed down off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sliver of light and the sound of pots and pans . He knew something was happening out there , but could n't figure out how he might get beyond the door . I picked him up , brought him back to me , and rocked him to sleep . The next night when I was feeding him , John again crawled off my lap and made it to the doorway on his hands and knees . This time , 24 hours later , and without any hesitation , he reached out and pulled open the door with his little hand . In one day he had gotten it together , an idea of just how to escape his room . He was now , as I told my wife later , smarter than our cat , who is still baffled at what to do with doors that are not quite open enough . As John grew and began to talk , the journal entries became filled with his one-liners . One winter , when all sorts of candidates were running for president-we watched the campaigning on TV-I was out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was darting around on the sidewalk , dodging pedestrians . When I asked him what he was doing , he shouted back , " I 'm running for president . " Looking back at my journal , I find his use of language particularly pleasing . Once , having eaten a bite of spicy Chinese food , he said , " My mouth is angry at me . " Another day , while we were walking slowly , my impatient son chided , " Do n't whisper along . " Living in a small apartment , without enough space for a child to play on rainy afternoons and winter days , I had to find alternatives . Scanning my journal , I remember how we used our local museum as John 's personal playground . The gem-and-rock room was best . It received few visitors late in the day , and it had carpeted steps big enough to climb , straight long ramps to race down , and all the artifacts safely behind glass , out of a little boy 's reach . I 'd turn him loose and let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's content while I learned more than I 'd ever planned to about the minerals , rocks , and precious gems of the world . It would take John exactly 20 minutes to exhaust himself , according to my journal , and then I 'd sit him down in the stroller , produce a juice bottle , and we 'd tour the museum for another hour , encountering Indian artifacts , African dioramas , and the beautiful masks of the Pacific Islands . I 'd forgotten much of those weekly winter visits . But in reading my notes it all comes back to me : the feeling of being alone with him in this vast world , the sounds of distant visitors , the eerie lights in all the exotic displays . Just me and my son , cooling down from his workout . I have this plan of someday presenting to him , perhaps at the birth of his first child , my stack of journal notes . Maybe they 'll give him a sense , once he 's a father , of who he was long ago , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would leave his father 's lap to crawl toward a shaft of light , wanting to know what was beyond his bedroom door .
