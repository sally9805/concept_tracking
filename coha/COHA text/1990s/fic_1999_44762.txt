I was sitting at an outdoor cafe across from the ocean in Florida when I spotted the man with the spotted dog . I thought it was interesting . Me at a seaside resort and a man with a spotted dog . It reminded me of the famous story where a man meets a lady with a dog , also at a seaside resort , and has a long-term affair with her . A story noted for its pathos and irony , a particular combination of which characterizes the renowned author of the renowned story . So . There I was in my short-shorts , gazing wearily at the spider veins in my legs , waiting for fate to intervene in my life . Thus I was melancholy , thinking of life 's great themes-disintegration and death , loss and heartache-when the man with the spotted dog sat at the adjoining table and ordered a moccachino . The dog was small , but muscular and somewhat ill-tempered . It strained against its leash and yelped annoyingly . The man shook open his New York Times and ignored it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Calvin Klein baseball cap . His sunglasses were chrome-plated Vuarnets . His legs were tanned and not too copiously hairy . <p> As I studied what parts of him were available around his newspaper , his dog barked angrily . At me , I suddenly realized . " Quiet ! " I was gearing up to say to the dog , when the man folded his newspaper and addressed me . " Are you wearing perfume ? The dog hates perfume . " <p> I was wearing Ma Griffe by Carven . " Oh , I 'm sorry . It 's such an adorable dog , " I lied . <p> " Come over here , so you wo n't have to shout , " said the man . <p> That is how I first came to know the man and his dog . They were from Connecticut . It 'd been a long time since I 'd been to Connecticut . When I thought of Connecticut , I thought of the woods and pine needle floors and muddy streams with skinny , silver-colored minnows . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mournfully . " It 's all urbanized and squalid . " <p> That night we went on a date , and the dog came along . " I just ca n't leave him at the motel , " said the man . I refrained from wearing Ma Griffe and prayed my underarm deodorant ( slightly scented ) would not set off the dog . <p> We went to a restaurant several blocks from the ocean where all the personnel wore lederhosen and Tyrolean hats . Our table had an absurd centerpiece which consisted of a rubber mermaid trapped in an oblong of frozen plastic , adorned with snakes and roses . <p> " That thing is really hideous , " I said . <p> " Well , I would n't know . I try not to be critical . " The man gave me a disdainful look . The dog licked my ankles and the tops of my shoes . <p> I decided to go out with the man for the following reasons : I happened to be in Florida visiting my elderly aunts , who were both nearly stone-deaf and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Condominium shouting at each other . I had been sleeping on the foldout sofa in the living room , and I felt as though I were always caught in their cross-fire . Also , Bessie and Fran were not cooks . For dinner we ate things like hard-boiled eggs and leftover Domino 's pizza . I was in the mood for a real dinner . Also , the man was good-looking in a sulky sort of way . He had dark eyebrows that almost connected into one brow over the bridge of his nose . And his teeth were okay , very straight and white , no spaces . Other than those meager physical attributes , it 's true he was not charming , even though he was obviously well-educated and liked animals ( or so I deduced ) . <p> Now I was beginning to fear that , really , we had nothing in common and the dinner would be one long , painful drudgery , face to face , chewing and swallowing . The dog was extremely irritating , my ankle was beginning to chafe from the action of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bluff , overhearty , Germanic sort of way , and in a corner of the bar a group of customers had gathered to sing beer-hall songs . I hated everything about this place . The idea of bratwurst nauseated me . Spaetzle likewise . <p> " You 're not a fan of the food ? You should have said something . " ness about his mouth , some small pursing of the lips with which he communicated his disapproval . I imagined him as a small child with a mother whose mouth he learned to imitate . I could picture him very clearly picking up his wretched little toys , making towers with his nasty little alphabet blocks . Even as a child , very clean . His lips beginning that prissy pursing . The more I imagined the man as a boy-screaming if his food items touched , washing his hands compulsively after riding a bus-the less likely it seemed he would ever own a dog , much less one who slobbered over my instep . <p> Now sprang to mind a picture of the man growing up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black shutters . His father , who had business internationally , was hardly ever at home . His mother , moody and removed , insisted upon certain standards of hygiene . I saw the boy , in impeccable slacks and shirt , standing forlornly on the sidelines while neighborhood kids tossed a football amongst themselves . A cast in one eye , he always appeared abstracted , inattentive . For this reason , teachers distrusted him , and one teacher went so far as to yank him brutally out of the cafeteria line and seat him in the cloakroom for twenty minutes . There among the damp smelling coats and galoshes of the day , he gazed out of a tiny , grimy window to a tiny , tremulous landscape . It seemed to represent his future : A sky with a moist cloud , a shaggy tree , and a dog with a few spots racing through . <p> O Chekhov ! Where are you now ? Because I want to wrap up this story of the man with the spotted dog , which is to say that I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle myself into the lumpy heft of the foldout sofa and listen to Bessie and Fran argue about laundry . But mostly I wanted the man on the other side of the trapped mermaid centerpiece to become kinder and more accessible and even funnier-to lean across the table and take my hand in his . " Darling , " he would say , " I have been waiting for you always , and now it is our good fortune to meet at last . " <p>
