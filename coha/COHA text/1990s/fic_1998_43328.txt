Rod Garcia 's first story collection , The Moon Maid and Other Fantastic Adventures , came out in hardcover earlier this year to good reviews . The same can be said of his fourth novel , his fantastic Western , American Woman . Meanwhile , Rod 's short stories are getting reprinted more widely in anthologies like David Hartwell 's Years Best SF ... all of which underscores our delight in bringing you this new SF adventure . While the title of this one fondly recalls Edgar Rice Burroughs 's books , the milieu is definitely hipper than the Mars of Dejah Thoris . Let 's hope we see more of it in days to come . <p> LENOR FLEW WITH WINGS spread wide , sculling with her wrists to maintain airspeed . Ahead lay South Pass , a serpent-toothed notch in a chain of volcanic peaks poking through the white cloud plain . Mt . Lemnos smoked in the near distance . Programmed memory made details instantly familiar , though Lienor had never been so far sunward before . She wore a green bolero jacket over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarlet hair streamed behind her , whipped by the wind like a captain 's pennant . Seeing a pair of wild rocs circling the pass , she wondered what they were doing so near settlement airspace . Hunting the unwary hippogriff ? Or innocently mating on the wing ? Two klicks from the mouth of the pass , she caught the great wave of air where the prevailing westerlies roll over Dayside Archipelago , soaring on the standing wave like a fiery-haired angel . Her wings were eight-meter Falcoform Condors , power-assisted , with foot-pedals , fingertip trim tabs , autoflaps and a flaring tail . Black photostrips on the upper surfaces allowed for glide refueling of the energy cells . They had borne her mother and grandmother before her . Lienor was not aloft for the sheer thrill of flight . Below her the Prinzess Lisa-Marie approached the cloud-wracked gap . Powered by turbofans and a cold fusion reactor , the titanic art deco airship had glassedin galleries , chrome falcon figureheads , and a lifting body hull - looking like the old Chrysler building , inflated and flying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather in the pass ; Lienor had to complete them . This was the Prinzess Lisa-Marie 's maiden flight through South Pass , with its infamous crosswinds and fabled wrecks . Her captain felt driven to see to each detail herself , trusting no one 's flying but her own . Weather radar spotted a convection cell above the neck of the pass . Closing her eyes , Lienor took a swift look . The Helm beamed her a picture , which her navmatrix projected onto a file image of the pass . Nanoseconds tumbled as she studied the image . Hot updrafts off the windward face of the Archipelago , hitting the clammy air in the pass , created downdrafts and condensation. 3V imaging made her feel like she was flying smack into the storm cell . An unsettling illusion . Lienor opened her eyes . " Got it , Gramma Lisa . " ( " Still going in ? " " Tell you when I get there . " Climbing over the peaks meant dumping ballast , then venting helium on the far side . Hazarding the pass saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a cliff face or a low saddle . ( " Your funeral , grandling . " ) A favorite expression . Great Grandmother Lisa 's funeral was long gone by . As a girl Lienor helped scatter Gramma Lisa 's ashes from the upper deck of the old Beaulieu out over the Great Reach beyond Mount Aphrodite . " Take care darling . " That was Mom , half a world away . ) ( Lilith and Lucifer called out characteristic encouragement , " Break a wing ! " ) Funeral or not , Llenor aimed to go in ahead of the ship , feeling out the gap , before trusting it with a quarter-kilometer dirigible . Telling her extended family to " mute it " - Lienor leaned forward , spilling air , lifting her tail and folding her wings back into a stoop . Ariel 's pull was half that of Old Earth . Falls started leisurely in .5 gbut were just as fatal . Many klicks below lay the hot dark surface , a pressure oven smothered in greenhouse gases . Pitiless terraforming had created a high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Ariel 's lower levels remained lethal . If the crash did not kill you , the surface would . South Pass rose to greet her . Airspeed climbed . Buffeted by turbulent air pouring into the pass , Llenor lowered her tail , turning her stoop into a fast glide , shooting into whirling cloudtops . She let cybersenses take over . Hearing with sonar . Seeing with radar . Ship 's altitude and true height were beamed straight to the tiny navmatrix grafted onto her skull . Altitude slowly increased , while true height plummeted . Ground rose up under the airship , climbing toward the summit of the pass . Prinzess LisaMarie 's margin of safety sank steadily-1300 meters. 1200 meters. 1100 meters ... ( Helm called out , " One klick. " ) " 900 meters. 700 meters. 500 meters ... " ( " Only half a klick below the keel . " ) " Drop ballast , " Lienor commanded . She needed 500 meters of true height in hand to cross the summit . ( " How much ? " ) " Keep us above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having flown airships ages before Lienor got her wings . ( When she learned she was dying , Great Grandmother Lisa had herself brainscanned . Lienor had downloaded her files into the Lisa-Marie , where she functioned as First Officer , always on watch , always at the Helm . ) Water gushed from the forward tanks . Altitude shot up . True height held steady . ( " Okay grandling , half a klick . Mind your flying . " ) " Mind your own , " she shot back . " Dog leg ahead . " Past the summit , the pass opened sharply to starboard , skirting smoking Mount Lemnos . The Prinzess Lisa-Marie would have to start her turn while still in the gut of the pass . A fully loaded airship took her sweet time turning , like a beamy dowager at a dance . Llenor banked high , raising her angle of attack to keep from caroming off the canyon wall . Air spilled from her wings . Turning the stall into a sharp dive , she regained control , sliding into a shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . She called out , " I 'm through . " Almost . Mt . Lemnos reared out of white blankness . Range closed rapidly . Llenor banked again , pedaling briskly to power her wings . She heard Gramma Lisa order the Helm put hard-a-starboard . But the Prinzess Lisa-Marie swung perversely to port , caught in a crosswind . Alarms oscillated wildly . ( " Damnation ! " ) Llenor tensed , forgetting for a moment to fly . Little sister Evie and a brace of cousins were aboard ship . And Llenor had put them all in harm 's way - just to save helium . Her first solo command threatened to be a family catastrophe , as bad as the crash of the Beaulieu . She shouted into the thin wind , " Turn , Gramma , turn . " ( " I 've got the Helm hard over , dear , " ) Turbofans whining in reverse , the quarter-kilometer ship , her helpless crew and extremely valuable cargo slid downwind , aiming to slam sideways onto the slopes of Mt . Lemnos . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volcano . In Gramma Lisa 's day , Lemnos wreckers made rich livings off South Pass . With only meters to spare , the rudders dug in . The ship swung to starboard , fins all but brushing a tremendous cinder cone to port . ( " We 're through . " ) Dead hands at the Helm had not lost their cunning . A chorus of amens came over the comlink  --  mixed with pant hoots from the SuperChimps - half the crew had been holding their breath . Shaking with relief , Lienor righted her own leeward drift , shooting out of the clouds - with the airship 's great lifting body hull gleaming behind her . Prinzess Lisa-Marie had cleared South Pass , and was ready to enter harbor . Congratulations rang in Lienor 's head : ( " Great job , grandling . " ) ( " Yeah , Lienor , " yelled Erie . ) ( " Lucky break , " chorused Lilith and Lucifer . ) ( " Good going , daughter . See you in Graceland . " ) That last was Mother at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened up ahead , with Port Myrine and the Lemnki settlement clinging to the far slopes . Stacks of hangars and a tall line of downwind mooring towers marked Myrine harbor . Skimming the cliffs , Lienor let the Prinzess pass beneath her , doing a flat dive at the upper deck . Spilling air , she stalled out , dropping her feet from the tail boom to touch down . Her bosun stood ready to catch her . He was a Thai , with the impossible name of Wah-tsoph-ki , hugely thick and broad-shouldered , wearing only his rigger 's harness and safety line . Llenor 's landing made his assistance a mere civility  --  their hands barely touching . But all Thals were wedded to simple ritual . Show Neanderthals token respect , and Homosapiens got away with murder . Otherwise there was no ceremony marking Llenor 's return . No bells rung . No " captain coming aboard . " Lisa-Marie was a family ship , run like a business , not like a battle cruiser . Lienor surveyed the long sweep of duraluminum deck , broken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her ship . But only by a pinfeather . She had been scared senseless when the airship swung to port . But the Prinzess was a lucky ship . Maybe that luck was working for her . Two hideous eight-limbed Bug Warriors guarded the cowling leading to the main cargo hold , clutching heavy assault rifles in their clawed forelimbs . Soft Prospero light glittered off armored carapaces . Llenor hated carrying Bug Warriors , but this trip the Prinzess Lisa-Marie crawled with them . Llenor spotted the Port Master 's gig coming out to greet them . ( " Careful , grandling , we 're coming about . " ) Snapping her safety line to a recessed stanchion , Llenor grimaced as the airship pivoted beneath her , turning to port to avoid settlement airspace . She hated unnecessary maneuvers in lively weather . Before the Settlers came , the idea of " owning " airspace was ludicrous . Air was air . You breathed it . If you had wings you flew in it . There were common sense rules , like giving way to starboard , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the air above the settlements " belonged " to them , pilots laughed . Then the Settlers set up flak towers and shot down intruders , putting an end to laughter . Now everyone humored them . The Port Master 's gig turned with them , cutting through forbidden airspace to catch up , showing that someone aboard had settlement permission . The small semi-rigid flew a captain 's pennant above the Port Master 's flag . Llenor nodded to her bosun . " Get ready to receive the gig . " Wah-tsoph-ki sounded his pipes and SuperChimps tumbled out of hatch cowlings to port and starboard . The gig matched vectors , dropping her mooring grapples . Chimps seized the dangling lines and marched the gig forward , fixing her nose to the foremast , then snapping the lines onto stanchions . The gig was moored . The Prinzess might lack the pomp and polish of a naval vessel , but she had a crack crew . Docking two moving ships with several klicks of air beneath their keels is not easy . Wah-tsophki made it seem routine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatch , and a handsome Homosapien stepped out - tall and muscular , with high cheekbones , deep luminous eyes , and black windblown hair . He wore a jaunty electric blue skin-suit , with BELL 'S BANSHEES stenciled above the left breast . An amused grin made it seem that he sensed the absurdity of meeting so casually in midair . Llenor liked that . Two women stepped out behind him , one dark , one blonde- but he was clearly in charge . And likely to do the talking . Bug Warriors appeared behind the women , slimmer and more scantly armored than the ones on the Prinzess Lisa-Marie . The Bugs aboard ship by the cargo hatch bristled , venom spines rising on their backs . Llenor heard the warning snicker of assault rifle safeties sliding off . Instantly the man spun about , snapping an order . His xenos disappeared into the gig . The hatch guards lowered their venom spines . Safeties slid back on . Everyone breathed again . Turning to Lienor , he bowed slightly , apologizing in polite Universal , " Sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banshees , enthusiastically at your service . " He did not bother to ask if she was Ship 's Mistress , just assuming it - easy , effective flattery . Bell was smart as well as pretty . Not dithering about , asking permission or standing on his " rights . " He saw , and acted . An immediate , intelligent response , rendered in take-charge fashion . Lienor did n't imagine she came off half so smashing , with wings limp , and her long red hair plastered with cloud dew . She had a flier 's body light , sturdy , strong at the shoulders-but nothing to turn a head , except perhaps her hair . She shot a mental question to onboard memory , " Who is he ? " ( BELL , Captain Lysander Adam ; Knight-Commander in the Noble order of Condottieri ; born offplanet , in interstellar transit aboard the colony ship Sierra Leone ; served with the White Company in the Far Eridani ; in action on Delta Eridani II and Piscium III , awarded Imperial Star , second magnitude . Came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; raised his own company insystem - " Bell 's Banshees " serving on Mount Zion and the Dayside Archipelago ; presently employed by the Helium Works ; no known wives or offspring . Gramma Lisa highlighted that last part . " But bound to be fine breeding stock , " she added . Lienor could see that . Breezy confidence and negligent good looks made Bell the most mateable male she had ever met . A man to make you give up all thought of cloning . Bell touched her wings . " You flew the canyon in these ? " Clouds still boiled out of South Pass - Bell seemed amazed anyone could navigate them with an airship in tow . Llenor admitted she had , no longer so ashamed of her hand-me-down wings . " You must show me how sometime . " He nodded toward the Bugs by the cargo hatch . " Helium Works wants the Banshees to back up the cargo transfer . Just in case .. . " He did not need to list the hazards of her cargo . His visit amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but Llenor welcomed the snap inspection , having nothing to hide , and finding the hired gun handsome . She was not even smuggling this trip . Not with what she had aboard . Bell nonchalantly introduced the women . " Commander Kia , my Exec , and an aide , Ensign Amanda . " Ria 's short dark hair framed a keen tight-lipped face , with no trace of Bell 's hidden amusement - just the business-like smirk of an experienced merc . One who had " seen too much , and killed too often . " Ensign Amanda was a sunny contrast . Small and blonde , with a look of utter blue-eyed innocence  --  despite a big recoilless automatic hanging on her slim waist . Saint Priscilla of the machine pistol . An odd pair , even for female mercs . Llenor shed her wings - handing them off to a Chimp - offering Bell a quick look at onboard security . " If you like . " Bell happily fell in with the suggestion . Slipping her safety line , she led her guests to the upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing their own species - let armed humans troop by without a second look . Lights went on for Llenor , winking out behind her . Doors dilated . She loved the way the ship obeyed , tracking her movements , anticipating her needs . She told the cargo lift to take them down to the keel . The main hold swarmed with Bug Warriors , jammed muzzle to mandible to make room for a mobile pressure vault with a blast-proof lock . The usual eight-legged horrors were backed by a brace of double-ended sixteen-leggers mounting mini-cannon , aimed smack at the lift . If they ever fired , the barrage would rip right through the hull , exploding well beyond the ship . But there was no arguing with Bug Warriors . They had to be humored or killed . Bell whistled appreciatively . " Seems damn secure . " To Llenor it was a bomb about to blow , but she did not say so . Her family had been seduced by sky high cargo rates and bedrock helium prices . Llenor had tried to veto the cargo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed-she would not fail just for the sour satisfaction of being right . Looking askance at the hold from hell , she told Bell she had to be on the forebridge for docking . Her disembodied First Officer could easily moor the ship , but Lienor did not mean to miss first-time landfall in a strange port . " Stay here and keep things covered if you want . " Bell looked politely aghast . " A few guns wo n't make an angstrom 's difference . We 're plainly at their mercy . " Llenor shrugged , telling the lock to cycle , letting the lift take them up . " Bugs got no big reason to kill us . " Bell cocked an eyebrow . " They wiped out a colony ship in Sculptoris sector . " Lienor corrected him . " They killed all the adult males , and women over breeding age . " Survivors on the Cape Colony had been mostly young women , like Llenor . " They just wanted to improve our population mix . Bugs do n't understand why we need old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aka " Bugs , " had spread themselves throughout the nearer spiral arm using a unique variation on hive reproduction . They aimed crude low-g ships full of egg cysts at clutches of G-type stars . Once they made contact with a space-faring culture the symbiots became indispensable , each hive producing an endless supply of bio-engineered servants , eager to perform the most obnoxious tasks - from fighting wars to scrubbing toxic tanks - all for the cost of feeding them . " Beware of geeks bearing gifts , " Bell warned . " Out beyond Sculptoris they 've found whole planets full of Bugs , older hives that contain non-Bug types-previously unrecorded sentient xenos - living off what the hives give them . Which could be a lot , or hideously little . " Llenor laughed , " That 's the Bugs , all right . " Such previously unknown xenos had to be remnants of alien races . Xenos who had taken in the Symbiots - and now survived as genetic samples , preserved on the chance the Bugs might find them useful . Llenor did not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adaptability that spread them around the spiral arm acted as a fatal flaw . Bugs did not invent or discover . They just plodded along , building their jury-rigged starships , serving anyone who stumbled on them . Straight out conquest seemed as alien to the Bugs as hosting a polka contest . Any natural animosity was reserved for their own kind . Some grotesque mechanism designed to spread the species made them maniacally belligerent in the presence of other hives . Spooky but comforting . Of course the sad remnants of forgotten races , living on hive handouts , must have thought they were pretty clever and in control when they first found the Bugs and put them to work . " You use them in the Helium Works , " Lienor reminded Bell . Her family had struck a profitable deal with the Bugs - but that did not make them so different . " That we do , " Bell admitted with a grin . " That we do . " Free limitless labor was tough to turn down . The lift carried them in silence to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task of bringing two Bug hives together . The armored box below contained a Hive Queen - the egg-cyst laying matriarch . They had to take this Hive Queen to the Helium Works to exchange genetic material with the local Queen . A weird , asexual femaleto-female mating between hypertense xenos - with Lienor and Bell as matchmakers  --  somehow vital to Bug survival . Both hives paid lavishly for the stud service , but if things went amiss it was pointless blaming it on the Bugs . The forebridge was in its customary chaos . Sister Evie hung half out an open widow , watching Port Myrine swing closer . Stepping off the slidewalk , Lienor snapped a safety line onto her little sister 's harness . " If you are going outside , wear a line . " Evie laughed . A smaller edition of Lienor , eight years younger , Evie was otherwise identical , right down to the bright gold-black lozenges on her flight suit . Too young to stand watches , she acted as an unpaid cabin girl , supposedly learning from Lienor . The Twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads together snickering . Llenor shot them a look . They switched to Old Speak , which the visitors were unlikely to understand . Crack comm-techs , the Twins often took it as their religious duty to offend strangers . Llenor 's second cousins , they were nearly identical , with curly blonde hair and sharp demonic faces . As much alike as male and female can be . Pleased to have an audience , Gramma Lisa landed with a flourish , sliding the Lisa-Marie in between two smaller semi-rigids . Human ground handlers , in white coveralls with swirling red stripes , secured the mooring grapples  --  something Chimps or Bug Workers would have done back home . Glad to be safely grounded , Llenor saw her guests back to the gig . Bell complimented the ship . Even Kia , his grim exec , cracked a wary smile . Ensign Amanda said nothing , just continuing to look sweet - a lovely , gun-toting work of art that most likely belonged to Bell . Llenor had n't the heart to be jealous . Ensign Amanda was one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere presence a pleasure . A middling strange threesome . But Bell was the one that mattered . His tough , ready good humor had her feeling better about pimping for a belligerent bunch of overarmed xenos . Donning a visored green cap to go with her bolero jacket and harlequin flight suit , Lienor told Gramma Lisa , " Clear the off-watch for port leave - I 'm going to Graceland . " Gramma Lisa chuckled . " Say " Hi " to Elvis for me . " ) Death had left her with a frivolous slant on religion . Telling Evie to stay aboard - and out of trouble - Lienor separated a pair of electronic scarabs , clipping one to her sister 's flight suit , tucking the other into a cuff . Evie protested , " Please take me . " Lienor refused . " Too dangerous . " " I 'll be lonesome . " " I 'll play you a game while I 'm gone , " Lienor offered . " You can be white . " Slipping a loaded stinger into an inside pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladder on the aft hangar deck - the closest hatch to the harbor slidewalk . ( Evie opened flier to flagship four . Llenor replied , " Flier to princessgriffin four , " plotting a Sicilian Defense . ) The steady exchange of moves would be better than a stick-tight for keeping track of Evie . Port Myrine 's human ground crew lounged in the shade of the ship , looking almighty bored in their red and white candy-striped coveralls . Men among them applauded as Lienor stepped off the ladder . She flashed an appreciative smile , and got a swift shock . Between the ground handlers and the slidewalk stood a guard in green and black , sporting a riot pistol and a bandoleer of gas grenades . No wonder the men seemed bored and overfriendly . They were convicts , penal labor . Port Myrine could afford to be lavish with human labor - like Bugs , they worked for meals . A woman sat among them , gaunt and gray-haired , dressed in candy-striped coveralls and electronic shackles . Their eyes met . Lienor sensed a surge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Llenor boarded the slidewalk . The woman looked away , staring listlessly into space . A nine-digit ID number was tattooed on her left cheek . Love Me Tender HUMANS , HALF-HUMANS , SuperChimps , xenos , and whatnot jammed the single-speed slidewalk . Finding her way blocked , Llenor stood watching port market stalls file past . Small Thal children sat leashed like dogs alongside heaps of nanoelectronics brought down the Archipelago from the Twilight Belt beanstalks . Hawkers in red flapping robes ran along with the slidewalk , waving bright offworld toys - pocket holocams , microprojectors , and the like . ( " Flier to princess four , " Evie threatened . Lienor replied with an exchange . ) Port Myrine was hotter than home . Shadows were shorter . Colors brighter . Ariel 's axial rotation exactly matched her orbital revolution . At this longitude there was no night or noon . Prospero looped about a point midway between zenith and horizon , making it always mid-afternoon , or maybe mid-morning . At home in the Twilight Belt , Llenor knew a slow mode version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lived offplanet for so long that she never connected daylight and darkness with the 24-hour clock brought from Old Earth . Landfall had been seven seconds shy of three A.M. - but all that meant to her was 02:59:53 , threequarters through the Midwatch . ( " Roc to princess-griffin three . " ) Evie was bringing out her rocs . Closing her eyes , Llenor summoned up the game . Never having so much as seen a board - Llenor pictured Evie 's array as a line of winged fliers , backed by armored hippogriffs and gunships . Lienor 's own pieces formed two lines abreast , like a flotilla of Black Pirates from Barsoom . Advancing one of her fliers , Llenor prepared to send her princess out aboard a sleek black destroyer . The slidewalk did an abrupt turn toward Lemnki Settlement . Llenor got off . What she wanted lay upslope , at the end of a simple footpath . As she mounted the path , the sounds of the slidewalk faded . Birds stilled . A sacred hush settled over everything . Myrine could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cone of silence stood the local Graceland Shrine , a relic brought intact from Tau Ceti by one of the first slowboats - before the beanstalks and high-g colony ships . Rusted columns supported a weathered dome and ivy-covered dish antenna . The sole attendant was a bum-scarred old woman . Sightless eyes stared over her offering bowl . Llenor dropped a tiny zero-g purge valve into the bowl . Wizened fingers felt the offering , then signed a benediction , waving her into the Shrine . Llenor thumbed the lock and entered . The door dissolved behind her . So did the Shrine , along with Port Myrine and the rest of Ariel . Llenor stood on a dusty bank , beside a huge sparkling sheet of muddy water a couple of klicks across , bordered by levees and canebrake . A stemwheeled riverboat churned past , belching black smoke from tall crowned stacks , making for a chute between the mainland and a wooded island . She opened the zips on her flight suit . It was the sort of simmering shadowless noontime found only on Ariel 's Subsolar Plateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no great wide rivers . No steamboats . And no yellow sun . She was on Earth . Old Earth . Just outside Memphis on the Mississippi . A boy sat fishing on a log , staring at the steamboat . He wore adult 's cast-off pants , cut short and rolled up , and a ragged straw hat stuck full of fishing lures . Loose suspenders crossed his sunburned back . No shirt . No shoes . No stress . As the steamboat passed into the chute , he looked up at Llenor with a gap-toothed Huck Finn grin . " So you licked South Pass . " Llenor smiled back . " Guess I did , Dad . " In Graceland the dead can pick their age and condition . Her step-dad spent eternity as a nine-yearold , matching his yen for youth . Dad 's grin widened . " Come on . Folks want ta celebrate . " He slid his fishing pole onto a bare shoulder and led Lienor away from the river . They crossed an old broken-down pasture , stirring up grasshoppers and tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the far edge of the field stood a water-stained shotgun shack . A woman who could have been Lienor 's twin sat on the porch swing , tuning a banjo . She had the same face , the same long red hair - but instead of a harlequin flight suit , she wore a loose white blouse and Daisy Mae cutoffs . She sang out , " Hi child . " Lienor said hi to Grandma Marge . Then the three of them set off through the woods , Llenor flapping along in her unzipped flight suit , Dad with his fishing pole , Gramma Marge carrying her banjo . " Princess to princess two . " Evie offered up a " poisoned pawn . " Lienor swept down on the bait , knowing only cool play would keep Evie from trapping her princess . ) Under the shade of the trees stood a plantation house with tall fluted columns of white pine . Bluegrass poked through gaps in the brick walk . Family members poured out to greet Llenor . Mother was with them . She was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deal older and heavier . Not being dead , Mom would have considered it vain to appear in Graceland younger than she was . Not all of Llenor 's family looked like her . Some were barely human . She had half-Thal cousins . And there were SuperChimps in the family too , adopted from the crew of the old Beaulieu . Not everyone could make it to the reunion . Some did not care to . Gramma Lisa was happy at the Helm of the Lisa-Marie , swearing she would not be caught dead in Graceland . Those who came treated Lienor to an old-fashioned picnic of fried chicken , sweet melon , cornpone and crawfish pie . People passed mason jars and wine jugs . Guitars and rhythm sticks came out , and folks began to sing , leading off with " Will the Circle Be Unbroken , " followed by a medley of Elvis tunes . When they got to " Love Me Tender , " Llenor cried at the outpouring of affection . Sometimes too much was expected of her . Educating and entertaining Evie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gun-toting xenos . But with such love behind her , how could she go wrong ? Lienor left the Shrine happy and hungry  --  virtual feasts never filled you up . It was eerie to step from Old Earth back into the endless afternoon of Port Myrine . No time seemed to have passed . Soft Prospero light fell at the same angle , casting the same shadows . As she left the cone of silence a skycycle swept by overhead , pedaling toward a floating villa , scattering a flock of silverwings feeding on windblown spores . " It 's all done with sensurround . " Startled , she looked downslope . It was Bell , resting on his heels beside the dusty footpath , looking a bit ashamed of his joke . Everyone knew shrines did not bring back the dead - but an unbeliever never knew the peace they gave the living . Bell stood up . " Bet you 're starving . " Showing he knew more about the shrines than most unbelievers . After flying South Pass , followed by a virtual picnic , Llenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mashed potatoes and pizza , or fried peanut butter and banana sandwiches . She dashed off a mental message . " Gramma Lisa , I 'm eating ashore . " It was her business to know Bell better . ( " Aye , aye , Capt'n . Ship 's quiet as the grave . just watch yourself . " ) ( " Enjoy child , but be careful . " ) That was Mom , listening in . This was going to be one of those outings where everyone watched her steps . Evie came on , begging another game . ( " You can be white . " ) ( " Okay . Flier to princess-griffin four . " ) " Roc to princess-griffin three . " ) Evie declined Llenor 's opening gambit . Lienor shifted to the Tartakower variation , something she could play in her sleep . Bell escorted her to the slidewalk . Port Myrine eateries were smoke darkened chop-shops , or plain canopies shading a gas ring set on the ground . The better sort doubled as brothels . " Noodles " n Nudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Different Cuisines ! Five Different Sexes ! " Bell shook his head . " Would n't touch that with a forty-meter mooring mast . " Lienor believed him . His skin-tight uniform showed no hint of overindulgence . She wished she could reach out and feel him , to make sure he was not a holo . He seemed that perfect . The slidewalk swung right up to Lemnki Gate . Flak towers poked over the settlement 's energy fence . Bell started to step off . Taken aback , Lienor seized his arm . It felt rock solid , not at all like a holo . " They wo n't let me in . " " Nonsense . " Bell 's smile turned mischievous , like a boy relishing a chance to do wrong . " Here the condemned can get a decent meal . " His thumb print cleared hers . ( " Have courage , child , " Mom advised . ) Behind the slate gray fence a shoulder of Mt . Lemnos had been blasted flat , creating a grassy expanse , as green as Graceland . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Port Myrine , it was weird to see nothing but humans . Lots of them . And all so different . A dozen races . Each face unique . Bell steered her toward a glass and chrome pavilion with soaring cantilevered wings anchored in ferroconcrete . Letters in tasteful Universal script floated before the entrance ramp : THE INTERNATIONAL FINE DINING FROM AROUND THE GALAXY THE BEST DISHES OF OLD EARTH , TAU CETI , SIRIUS , AND THE ERIDANI HUMAN SERVICE ONLY . THE MANAGEMENT WILL NOT SEAT XENOS , HOMONEANDERTHALS , OR BIOENGINEERED BEINGS OF ANY SORT . ) The redundancy of the last part was chilling . Since entering the settlement Lienor had not seen anyone looking the least bit " bioengineered . " Much less a Thal or xeno . Bell took her firmly by the elbow . " Only a restaurant . It wo n't eat you . " Striding straight through the message , he found them seats on a hanging veranda . A young man in a silver cape and skin-suit met them at the table . Expecting an introduction , Lienor assumed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All Bell said was , " We 'll start with sliver-leaf salad , carrot and cashew soup , and a pitcher of apricot lassi . " Mr. Silversuit was a waiter , something Lienor had heard of , but never seen . Scary , but at least he did not have a number tattooed on his cheek . Rattled at the thought of human service , Llenor found the menu overwhelming . The place offered everything from " Baked Lyrian Bluefish " to " Hush Puppies and Hoe Cakes . " Plus a whole list of " Sweet Inspirations . " Bell suggested the Champignons farcis with black bean bulgar . Llenor swiftly agreed , hoping that would make the waiter go away . ( Evie castled . Lienor came back with hippogriffin to gunship four . ) Bell waved Mr. Silversuit off , saying , " They make the best sou f fll rothschild this side of the Sad Cafe . " Llenor muttered , " Maybe we should go there . " She would have felt safer at that noodle-cum-knocking-shop by the slidewalk . " It 's in Glory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrow . " You 're not nervous , are you ? " Lienor nodded , staring off at a herd of real hippogriffs grazing at the edge of the trees - semi-intelligent bird-winged beaked quadrupeds , bioconstructs from Beta Hydri IV , used as gardeners , beasts of burden , and pieces in aerial chess . They broke the monotony of seeing only humans . ( " Flier to flag-gunship three , " Evie threatened again . ) " Is it because you are a clone ? " Bell asked . Llenor gave a startled nod , looking to see if the waiter was hovering about . " How did you know ? " " Your little sister looks exactly like you . And those twins are a dead giveaway . " The waiter popped back up with their pitcher of apricot lassi . ( " Flier to flag-griffin three , " Evie repeated impatiently . ) Lienor started a furious series of exchanges to keep Evie occupied . Flier takes flier . Roc takes flier . Griffin takes griffin . Princess takes griffin ... The waiter poured the lassi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Evie were clones of her mother . All of them being genetic copies of Gramma Marge . And Lilith and Lucifer were not just twins . " They are clones of Aunt Freya - only Lucifer was gene-spliced to produce testosterone at puberty . Until then everyone thought he was a girl . Then during one Wedding Day skinny-dip - Wham ! " " You discovered Lilith had a brother ? " " One May First we girls are n't like to forget . " Even coming from three generations of women who had reproduced without men , Lienor found the Twins eerie . " They do everything together . Standing the same watches . Sharing the same cabin . They 're never out of each other 's sight . " " What 's that language they speak among themselves ? " " English mostly , " Lienor admitted . " I suppose you speak it too . " " Only at home . " Lienor tried not to look ashamed . Elvis sang in English , but she did not say it - no sense spoiling things by arguing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it around here . " Llenor knew better than that . It was bad enough being in a settlement . She kept fearing some overpolite waiter would pop up and denounce her as a " bioengineered being " pretending to be human . " Does that bother you ? " " That you speak a dead language ? " " No , that I 'm a clone . " She desperately hoped it did n't matter . Bell laughed . " Hell no . It 's who you are that matters , not how you got here . So far what I see is great . " Llenor blushed . Embarrassed but happy . " And being your mother 's twin is not technically a crime . You must be genetically altered to run afoul of Settler Law . " Like Lucifer . Llenor had a horrid image of the Twins run amok in Lemnki Settlement . It would get them all burned at the stake . She took a swig of the lassi , finding it cool and tingly , feeling instantly better . Almost light-headed . The waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helium Works gig was just to keep the Banshees breathing . " I do n't aim to start a xeno stud service . " " Then you 'll be up for hire ? " " To the highest bidder . " Lienor racked her brain for some reason why the family might need a company of mercenaries . Like to found a trading station beyond Aphrodite . Anything to keep Bell around . lEvie threatened Llenor 's remaining hippogriff . Llenor replied by grabbing a flier , setting up a wicked roc cross . ) Bell kept up an encouraging stream of conversation . By the time they got to the souffle rothschild , Lienor felt absurdly relaxed . Ready to take on all the Bugs in Myrine . So confident she suspected there was something in the lassi . But Bell was matching her glass for glass . He downed the last of the lassi . " Want to teach me to fly ? I know where we can rent wings . " " Why not ? " Lienor thought . She seemed to be several meters above the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was possible . They took the slidewalk back to the harbor . The hangar-top rental stall stocked everything from hang gliders to nine-meter Albatrosses . Bell became immediately enamored with a sleek pair of Sparrow Speedsters . Lienor steered him away from the Speedsters- " You ca n't start on racing wings . " Instead she selected Peregrine Hawks , the closest to her own Condors , but better for beginners . She started Bell off on short glides at the end of a flying tether . The sweeping updraft off the windward side of the hangars made it hard to fall . He beat back and forth , easily copying Llenor 's movements . Either Bell was an apt pupil , or she was a natural teacher - but everything they did together turned out perfect . Immensely pleased , Llenor asked if he wanted to fly to the sky hook . " Sure . " Bell was clearly having a ball . " You 'll have to lose the ground line . " " Is n't that the object ? " Right . Lienor nodded to port , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bearing two-nine-zero and a bit down to you . " He had spotted the skyhook , transposing the bearing in his head . " Cast off when you are ready . " Lienor saw the tether line fall away . Except for a stiffness in his glide , Bell might have been doing this for decades . She took station above and behind , soaring out over the globegirdling cloud plain . A pair of peregrines flew with them . Ahead hung the hook , a series of trapeze seats suspended from an aerodynamic spar , looking like the fishing jigs Dad wore in his straw hat . As they approached , Bell 's inexperience showed . He came in too fast , missed his stall , then missed the hook . Lienor had to dive down , catch him from behind , then let her momentum carry them onto the hook . They ended up sitting on the same seat , laughing at her catch . Neither moved to break contact . " Magnificent , " Bell exclaimed . " No wonder you are an airship captain . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind her first command . " Why ? Did you steal that ship ? " " Some folks think so . " Bell grinned . He was the type to appreciate a little ably engineered larceny . " Mom was my step-dad 's fourth wife , a lot younger than the others . We were never popular - an unwed mother with cloned daughters and weird Outback relations . But Dad took me on as a cabin girl , saying I should learn the trade . " Until now Dad had been the only man in her life - unless you counted Lucifer . Her hero , mentor , and protector . " He took me to the Eastern Isles , even Nightside . By the time I turned sixteen he had me piloting solarplanes and semi-rigids . " " I 'd like to meet him . " " He went down with the Beaulieu . " The only place Bell would see Dad was in Graceland - and Bell was not a Believer . He gave a sober glance . " I 'm glad you were n't with him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was iffy . The whole crew was brainscanned beforehand  --  right down to the SuperChimps . " Bell said he had heard of the wreck . " His wives and grown children swooped down - kicking me out . Barring Mom from the funeral . " " That must have hurt . " Bell 's arm came out of his wings , taking her sympathetically about the waist . She leaned into him , letting Bell steady her on the seat . " Then they decoded his will , and found a dying codicil - added as the Beaulieu went down . " " Making a provision for your mother ? " " Nope , " Lienor laughed . " By then he and Mom were split . " It was plain Dad had transferred affection to Mom 's look-alike daughter . " His codicil left the whole shipping line to me . The Prinzess Lisa-Made , plus six semi-rigids and a solarplane taxi service . " Bell 's blue eyes sparkled , " I 'll bet that 's a will they worked hard to break . " " They called me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court but could not break the codicil . His wives all had lands and income , and could not claim to be destitute . To satisfy the court , I deeded the line over to my mom 's family until I 'm twenty-one . But I made damn sure I was Head Pilot . " In half a year the line would revert to her . " Do you mind that my family runs to extremes ? " Llenor worried Bell would find this all too much . " Like those twins ? " Bell shook his head . " Being always together and sharing the same cabin , do they ? Well ... " " I hope not . " Lienor hated to speculate on the Twins " sex lives . " Elviz would not like that . " Bell bore down on the " z " to emphasize the Universal pronunciation . " Kissing cousins are okay , but the King knew where to draw the line . " " I do n't think the Twins care what Elvis thinks . They 're Satanists . " Lucifer had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weird little girl to a weirder little boy . But Aunt Freya was Reformed Church of Beelzebub , and acted pleased with her genetic joke . Giving up human sacrifice had not taken away their sense of humor . " Elviz loved all religions . " Bell 's tone made it clear the King loved Satanism least . " Sorry my family is so strange . " She felt like a freak . " No stranger than mine , " Bell looked rueful . " You saw Kia and Amanda . My exec and her blonde young ensign . Their off-watches must make Lilith and Lucifer seem normal . " " You mean they are lovers ? " " If you call it that , " Bell smirked . " Beauty and the Beast . " It was an arresting image . Kia with her armorplate aura , having complete command over sweet young Amanda - an on-duty aide and off-watch concubine . Before Lienor could recover , Bell leaned over and kissed her . A surprisingly gentle kiss , patient yet commanding . Mother started to come on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole extended family on hold . When their lips parted , Lienor asked , " Then you do n't have a lover ? " " No-but I hope I am about to . " He said it with soft reassurance , like someone not afraid of the finer emotions . Llenor whispered a short prayer to Elvis . The King never thought sex was sinning . Even in his mortal life - before his returns from death millions of women desired him . Elvis did his best not to deny them , but most went away disappointed . For of all the women in the world , Elvis loved his mother most - Gladys Mother of God . Until he met Priscilla . She was only fourteen , but Elvis knew she was the one . Priscilla 's father - a great pilot and the original Colonel Beaulieu  --  trusted Elvis , letting Priscilla live in Graceland . Elvis could have succumbed to temptation any time , but he waited until Priscilla was twenty-one , and they were married . Waiting was hard on Elvis . And harder on Priscilla . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Llenor felt about Bell . He was the one for her . And in a matter of months she would be twenty-one , owning the shipping line outright . Then if she wanted to sail off with Bell at her side , who would stop her ? But Bell wanted her now , and Llenor could feel herself yielding . " We could climb to the roost , " he suggested . There was not much you could do , sitting on a narrow trapeze seat with nothing beneath you but cloud plain . lEvie came on , demanding Llenor make a move . ) " Sure , " Llenor nodded toward the roost . Closing her eyes , she took a quick look at the game . She had her gunships in line , and her hippogriff backing her princess . Evie 's flagship was cornered , guarded by her roc and princess . " Game 's over girl . " ) I " What ? No way ! " ( " Gunship to griffin eight , check . Roc takes gunship . Gunship takes roc , check . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) " Stinker ! " ) ( " Find something to do . Sis is about to be busy . " ) Sis was about to be mated . Leaving their wings behind , they climbed the light ladder to the roost . Lienor left her bug clipped to her wings there were lessons Evie did not need to learn just yet . The roost was a ringed platform circling the spar , held aloft by a gasbag farther up , tethered to the cliffs . From the roost Lienor could see the whole circle of the world . Port Myrine , Lemnki Settlement , and the cloud-wracked Archipelago stretching back toward the Twilight Belt and Nightside . And in the opposite direction , Mount Aphrodite . Beyond Aphrodite stretched the Great Reach , an empty sea of air . On the far side lay the untamed Subsolar Plateau - a huge tidal bulge thrust through the cloud layers . A land of eternal noon , nine-tenths burning waste , with human and non-human enclaves clinging to its flanks , cut off from the rest of Ariel by danger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took was courage and imagination . And the willingness to wait a few months  --  until Llenor came into her inheritance . But Bell wanted her now , deftly undoing the zips on her harlequin flight suit . His hands slid inside , caressing her bare hip , fingers brushing the rosy hair between her thighs . Lienor shivered . She just did not have Elvis " self-denial . Who did ? The world beyond Mount Love would have to wait . By the time they got back to the Prinzess Lisa-Marie , a warm rain was falling . In the shelter of the airship , Bell kissed her goodbye . They both needed sleep - or at least rest . He looked up at the tall block letters on the ship 's hull . " You 'll have to change that name . " Lienor mumbled an apology , eyes downcast . " Lisa-Marie is a family name with us . " Settlers had declared Universal the official language , banning all foreign or alien spellings . Llenor 's family tried to compromise , putting " Prinzess " in Universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an unofficial addition stenciled semi-legally onto the hull . " It 's sacrilege , " Bell reminded her . " As bad as spelling Elviz with an " s . " Liza-Marie is a saint , whose marriage to a despised black man brought the races of Old Earth together . " Llenor nodded , ashamed that her folks were such hicks . She had not meant to slight Lisa-Marie , or the historic racial harmony her marriage to Saint Michael produced . Happily , Bell did not know that her Satanist cousins denied even the divinity of Elvis - hoping he would send them to Hell . Lienor rode a clanking conveyor down to the local Bugville . She felt incredibly overdressed in her heat suit , rebreather , crash helmet and half armor , her hands encased in laser-gloves . Bumping along behind her was the armored box containing the Hive Queen , with a dozen mean-looking Bug Warriors riding shotgun . Meter-long insects buzzed about . All she could think about was seeing Bell again . Dizzy with anticipation , she kept her visor up , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mating , with heavily armed xenos for chaperones , is not an ideal second date - but Bell 's confidence was contagious . This deadly rigmarole was just a last hurdle , no worse than navigating South Pass . The conveyor descended . Terraced gardens gave way to kilometer-tall cloud forests . Giant trees planted to break up the mountain flanks pulled in air and light , shedding tons of organic matter . Winged bioengineers flitted through the steamy canopy , inspecting and pollinating . Each tree was unable to reproduce on its own , part of a transition ecology , intended to give way to self-reproducing species . Heat and pressure mounted . Lienor sealed her visor , relying on the rebreather . Her suit refrigerator hummed louder , laboring to keep things bearable . None of this bothered the Bugs . Bug Warriors were tough , and the Bug Workers who drilled for Helium were bred to work in this stifling stew . The Helium Works sat below the treeline on a barren rock bench . Pressure domes loomed ghost-like in the murk . The usual guards had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armor . Bug Warriors would not have been able to let rival hive members enter . The squad commander ordered the lock to cycle in soft no-nonsense tones . Bell liked female subaltems - " They work hard . Guys listen to them . And they are not prone to testosterone attacks . " Bell was inside , flanked by Kia , standing guard over the armored box containing the Helium Works Hive Queen . Lienor made eye contact through their polarized visors . Bell 's mouth was covered by his rebreather mask , but already she knew his face well enough to see he was smiling . Bug Warriors lined up on both sides of them , just like mental chess , with Bell opposing her instead of Evie . Only this time the warriors and weapons were real . Spines bristled , and safeties snickered off . Tension felt as thick as the air . It was plain the Bugs themselves could not have pulled it off . Not in such cramped quarters . Not with so many weapons . Xenobiologists speculated that such matings used to be frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each hive trying to get genetic material without giving any up . Assault guns and mini-cannon made such meldes unthinkable . Humans had to substitute for brute force . " Ready ? " Bell 's voice sounded flat over the comlink . Lienor acknowledged , charging her laser gloves , breathing softly . Bell cycled his lock . She did the same . Vault doors swung slowly open , synchronized to give neither side an advantage . The Hive Queens emerged , great segmented monsters with sixteen legs to a side . Normally humans never saw a Queen . Hives had no good reasons to relax their guard . They looked like two of the double-bugs run together - but while the sixteen-leggers had heads at both ends , Hive Queens had a single head , and rears clearly adapted for cyst-laying . They reared up , legs beating the thick air , like huge centipedes doing some drunk ballet . A ripple ran through the lines of Bug Warriors . Llenor 's fingers twitched inside her laser gloves . She had orders to shoot any Bug showing hostile intent - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it came from humans . As if on psychic command the Hive Queens extended pseudo-legs from the underside of their main segments . Weaving back and forth , the spindly legs closed the gap between the Queens , each one tipped with a shiny wet sack . Llenor watched , weirdly fascinated . She should have been scanning the ranks of Bug Warriors , but she could not . How often do you get to see a Bug mating ? The act underlying seemingly infinite adaptability . The two sacks contained germ plasm brought across light years , stored for centuries . After hearing that the Bugs kept their former hosts as house pets , Lenor bet her shipping line that not all the plasm came from Bugs . Other xenos , even humans , probably contributed , voluntarily or otherwise . Bell told grisly stories about the fate of the males aboard the Cape Colony . The glistening sacks touched . And chaos erupted . First came a stabbing flash of light . Polarizers on Llenor 's visor cut in , but not before things went black . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic-stricken . Then came the blast . A tremendous surge of pressure lifted Lienor up , slamming her into something hard . Only the rebreather clamped to her chest and the suit plugs in her ears kept her from being crushed and deafened . Bouncing off whatever she hit , Lienor saw spots , and heard weapons firing . Shrapnel rattled down around her . She lay gripping the deck in darkness . The mad wall of sound sank down to a confused clatter , rising and falling as explosive shells searched for targets . Polarizers had saved Llenor 's sight , but the Bugs were blinded , making them a dozen times as dangerous . Normally a Bug could be relied on not to shoot at a human  --  unless another human ordered it to . But these Bugs were wildly returning fire , shooting at sounds . Shutting off her polarizers , Llenor strained to see . Dancing lights gave way to muzzle flashes . Most of the Bug Warriors were down . Hive Queen parts lay scattered about . A single Bug , minus half its limbs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , firing its assault gun , drawing fire from all directions . Just the sort of thoughtless hostility Llenor was supposed to suppress . Carefully as she could , Lienor extended her right laser glove , raising the thumb sight . Four or five thumbs floated in front of her . She brought her left hand around to steady the glove , cutting the number of floating thumbs to two . Splitting the difference , she fired silently , her laser splashing over the downed Bug . The xeno stopped shooting . Crossfire slackened . Llenor looked about . Eia lay crumpled against the blackened door of a blast-proof box , missing an arm and leg , her body armor riddled . Bell must have been right at the epicenter . His bloody helmet lay a few meters off . She could not tell if his head was inside . Hearing a plop , she turned to see a grenade land to her left . It rolled toward her , stopping just out of reach . So close she could read the CAREFUL FLAMMABLE/EXPLOSIVE warning label . The safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her left laser glove to shield her face . The blast caught her in mid-motion. jailhouse Rock THE ROOM she awoke in was so white and sterile Lienor immediately tagged it as a sick bay . Being strapped to an autodoc with tubes snaking out of her lent substance to the assumption . It had to be a critical care unit since the walls were shielded , cutting off contact with the outside . Everything else was mercifully vague . She had been in the Helium Works , the Hive Queens were making it . Then wham ! - all hell broke loose . What followed was a ghastly blur . She was fairly sure she had killed a Bug ... And Bell was dead . No doubt there . He had been standing atop the blast . Waves of grief and nausea gripped her . A wild sense of loss made her want to tear the tubes and patches off her body , but she had n't the strength to get out of the autodoc . Instead she lay there utterly alone - a novel experience that soon got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got no comfort from Mom . No salty advice from Gramma Lisa . Even Evie wanting to play would have been something . Solitude was great for wallowing in grief - but it cut her off from life . Her first visitor was a big disappointment . Without warning , a wall dilated and an offensively perky young woman appeared . She had short sandy hair , an upturned nose and an aggravating grin . " Are you conscious ? " she asked . " Not really . But come in anyway . " The woman took a couple of seconds to figure that out , then stepped inside , asking , " How do you feel ? " " Rotten " was the first adjective that came to mind . Llenor could honestly say she had never felt worse . " When do I get out of this autodoc ? " She thought about it , then decided , " I sure could not say . " Lienor glared at her tormentor . " Are n't you a medic ? " After another delay , she exclaimed , " Goodness no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Llenor saw she was dealing with someone really slow . The young woman had the look of a Settler , wearing a pearl-gray suit trimmed with taffeta . An audio-optical bug clung to her lace lapel , trying hard to look like a broach . She took her usual irritating time answering . " I am Miriam Holiday . Your lawyer . " Another blank moment , then she nodded enthusiastically . " Court Another blank moment , then she nodded enthusiastically . " Court appointed . " Lienor stared at the smiling , sandy-haired moron . " I 'm talking to a bugheaded holo . You are n't even onplanet , are you ? " The pauses were speed-of-light lag . Counselor Holiday was on one of the beanstalk geosync stations . " That 's right . I am Pair-a-Dice representative for Li Sing &; Wainwright . Main offices in Mount Zion . " " I do n't want a lawyer . All I want is to call home . " Or better still be discharged . Sickbay felt claustrophobic . In a moment Miriam replied . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't anyone told you the charges ? " " This is all a huge shock , " Lienor assured her . Miriam reeled off offenses , sounding like a summary of the penal code . " Terrorism , murder , malicious mayhem , willful sabotage , misuse of explosives , wanton defacement ... " " What ? For killing a Bug ? " Another annoying pause . " That comes under defacement of property . Xenos contracted to the Helium Works are legally listed as equipment , to avoid the animal cruelty statutes . You are accused of killing Adam Lysander Bell , and his exec ... " Lienor remembered Kia , sprawled against the burnt blast door with an arm and leg gone . " Prosecutors have established a prima facie case based on the microdetonator and superconducting primer , plus traces of nitrates on your clothes and body ... " " Detonator ? Primer ? " Another maddening delay . " The primer and microdetonator found in your suit cuff . " Absolutely impossible . But the brainless holo kept spouting absurdities . Llenor was accused of preposterous crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She realized she was " baby strapped " to the autodoc , unable to reach the clasps . " What about the Xenophobes ? " " The who ? " Miriam acted like she never heard the word . " You know . Alien haters . This bombing has Xenophobe all over it . " Whoever killed Bell had wiped out two hives as well - without their Queens , Bugs could not long survive . " You must be more explicit . " Llenor was literally talking to someone from another world . " Xenophobes . People who wo n't serve Thals in restaurants . And keep Chimps out of the Settlements . At every election the Humanists harp on how Ariel is reserved for humans . How they 're saving us from the xenos . A lot of folks really believe that . " As far as Llenor cared , Ariel could be reserved for caterpillars just so they got along . Miriam replied primly . " Having or expressing an opinion about aliens is not a crime . " " Unless you express it by blowing folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a SuperChimp - an " got off with a fine . Claimed the Chimp acted frisky . " " Frisky ? " Another word new to Miriam . " Cousin Wilber 's a man of few syllables . And the Chimp could not tell his side . SuperChimps work hard an " cheap - and their babies are cute - but some folks still hate " em . Bugs give everyone the heebie jeebies . " " So ? " Her lawyer refused to see any connections . " A lot of folks would like to blow the Bugs up . " " We ca n't accuse " a lot of folks . " " So much for Settler Law . Llenor saw the real bombers were not likely to figure in the case . " Look , I need to talk to my family . " Miriam considered . " An open channel is impossible . All visitors must come in person ... " Dad and Gramma Lisa could not come " in person . " Mom was a world away in the Twilight Belt . " How about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Miriam looked embarrassed . " The Prinzess is no longer in harbor . The Port Master attempted to board and impound material evidence . Someone cut the magnetic grapple and dumped liquid ballast , flying off with the Port Master and drenching his bodyguards with waste water . " Hurrah for Gramma Lisa . " The Port Master survived , but is pressing assault and kidnaping charges against your cousin Lucifer Freyason ... " Survived ? Lucifer must be getting softhearted . Or just slothful. " ... and an unknown Thal . " That would be Wah-tsoph-ki . Miriam eventually faded out . Lienor realized she was on Jailhouse Rock . Not the original one , which was a prison asteroid in the Mt . Zion system . Or maybe orbiting Old Earth . This was the Port Myrine brig , on a pinnacle above the harbor . Every prison was called Jailhouse Rock . And it slowly sank in that they never meant to let her out . Once she was out of the autodoc , and dressed in candy-cane coveralls , there were enforced exercise periods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All within her cell . The trial was also in her cell . So was the appeal . Both before Settler courts . The main difference was the time lag . The first court was on Paira-Dice , and the light speed lag just made the judges seem slow-witted . The appeals court was in Mt . Zion system  --  several light hours away making the second round seem like an episodic 3V play acted out in her cell . Llenor was allowed to proclaim her innocence at the cost of having to hear all the impossible , damning physical evidence . The nitrates on her clothes and body , the primer and detonator in her cuff . Half the judges had to be Humanist appointments , happy to have a culprit not tied to their party . In each case the verdict was the same , " Guilty on all counts . " The first time Llenor felt shocked , as if she had not heard right . The second time she expected it . Miriam shook her empty holographic head , wishing she could have done better . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " Miriam thought a moment . " Standard sentences ? " " Unless they have some special on . " " Destruction and defacing , that 's a simple caning - five strokes for each count . I think I can keep the total under twenty . " Good for Miriam . Up till now having a lawyer had been fairly useless . " The malicious mayhem , assault , willful sabotage , and misuse of hazardous materials ; that 's two to three decades of hard labor . Which I could try to get reduced . But you might prefer the full sentence ... " Why ? For the fresh air and exercise ? " What about murder and terrorism ? " The charges that really scared her . Signals seemed to take forever , leaping back and forth at light speed . " Oh , that 's hopeless . There you 're looking at death . " And hardly finding it appealing . " Then who the fuck cares about the other charges ? " Miriam took her usual time answering . " You might . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the penal servitude put first . You could live for twenty , thirty years ... " Then be executed . She thought of the aging woman in the ground crew with a tattoo on her cheek . What was she looking forward to when her time was up ? Lienor now wore nine similar numbers , listing her crimes and identity . The labor sentence was at least life , and she might see the family . " What about brainscan ? " " It would defeat the purpose of execution . " Miriam left . Even Graceland would be denied her . But for the moment she still had her memories . Rummaging through navmatrix files , Lienor replayed her first solos at home , seeing the peaks of Atoll coming closer in low Prospero light . The huge Twilight Belt caldera had a dozen peaks , and two habitable sections of ringwall , surrounding a great eroded volcanic cone . Aerostadts swung between the peaks . Forests climbed the ringwalls . Mount Aloha was marked by the gleaming thread of Aloha beanstalk , rising out of sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was descending the stalk , like a silver egg on a steel guitar string . She swung her ship up to the family mooring mast . Dad congratulated her . Mom and Evie came out to greet the ship . Miriam cut the memory short . Lienor left home thinking , " This better be worth it . " It was n't . Miriam confessed that she could not get the caning cut to under thirty strokes . " They are determined to set an example . " Lienor was no longer surprised . Her luck practically demanded it . " And they have commuted your labor sentence . " " Can they do that ? " " Work gangs are full . They are cutting back on prisoners . " In her case clemency meant beating and execution . They were keeping her in this box until it was convenient to kill her . Shaking with anger , she told her lawyer , " Just go away . " Miriam did not move . " Go away , " Lienor shouted . " You 're worse than the Bugs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now Lienor hated the Settlers , hated them with all her heart . Until this happened , Lienor had been above politics , seeing no point to it . Some Settler party always won . If not the Humanists , then the Greens . Since the biosphere took hold , incoming colonists from Epsilon E and the Home Systems had outnumbered humans born onplanet . Thals , Chimps , and xenos had it easy - they were n't allowed to vote . Under Settler Law you had to be human , with no kinky chromosomes . She had not minded Settlers running things . They were pushy but effective  --  putting down pirates and wreckers . Big on free trade . Only thing that had galled her was how they looked down on everyone . Thais and Chimps were automatically animals . Xenos were vermin . And now they meant to put her down without a speck of regret . Someone killed Bell and Kia . So the Settlers would kill her , strapped to the same autodoc she came in on . " Lethal injection , " to teach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her innocence was a side issue . Settler Law was beyond the truth . Only " rights " and " legality " mattered . They were actually proud of that . Said it was a sign of civilization . She hoped Elvis reamed them good . You ca n't fool the King . From then on she lived for her virtual trips home , lying in her box , seeing Atoll and her family , reliving moments she had meant to keep forever . Giving up on " reality . " Food and sleep were for the living . Llenor was as good as dead . The next time she was pulled out was like a waking dream . Suddenly she was back in her cell - but not able to move . Paralyzed . Unable to twitch a toe . She wondered if her navmatrix had gone haywire from overuse . Her cell door dilated . Lienor expected to see Miriam , returning with one more inanity . Instead she saw a mobile bug . A six-legged electronic scorpion , with tiny lens antennas , and a huge hypo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of her bed , scrambling atop her immobilized body , headed for her neck . Its hypo tail raised . Llenor screamed , but nothing came out . All she could think of was " lethal injection . " This was not how it was supposed to happen . What about the caning ? The hypo took aim at her carotid artery . " This is for your own good , " whispered the scorpion . It struck . Lienor felt instantly better . Paralysis vanished . The hypo had held an antidote to whatever was holding her down . Plus some powerful stimulant . The scorpion leaped off her , headed for the open door , saying , " Follow me . " Llenor was up and out the door , ahead of the bug , into the lighted corridor beyond . But which way to go ? The electronic bug scurried between her legs . Doors dilated before it . Llenor bounded after it . If this was a dream , she begged Elvis not to let her wake up . She passed a pair of guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Victims of a paralysis field . Or some anesthetic gas . Llenor saw daylight ahead . She burst out onto a bare , flat loading dock , with tall slick walls . Prison trustees in candy-striped coveralls lay strewn about the penned-in tarmac . The nearest had an anesthetic dart in her neck . A pair of adhesive boots stood waiting on the dock . " I 'm free , " she shouted . Not strictly true- she was surrounded by high smooth prison walls - but she gushed thanks for getting this far . Voices filled her head in reply : ( " Thank Elvis , dear . " That was Mom . ) ( " We sure did not do it , " Gramma Lisa assured her . ) ( " Thank Satan , " suggested Lucifer and Lilith . " Put on the boots , " said the scorpion . Llenor pulled on the adhesive boots , hurriedly telling everyone what had happened . The scorpion called to her , " Follow me . " It scurried up the far wall . Lienor dashed after the bug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots to grip , she ran right up the wall , expecting a laser beam in the back . She gained the top alive . And saw nothing on the far side but empty air . The leeward edge of the Archipelago fell straight away in a series of sheer cliffs . Wind plucked at her , trying to hurl her into the rocky abyss . Far below lay the broiling surface . Only the boots kept her atop the wall . Llenor looked wildly about . The tiny scorpion climbed up her coveralls , perched on her back , and whispered , " Jump . " ( " What 's happening ? " Llenor told them . ( " Do n't trust it , " Evie squealed . ) ( " Take care , " Mother advised . ) ( " Jump , jump , " chorused the Twins . ) No time to hold a vote . With a Hail Gladys on her lips , Llenor told the boots to release , launching herself into space . All Shook Up " Hail Gladys , full of grace .. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With familiar slowness at first , as though she were in a stoop . Only with no wings to catch her . " The King is with thee ; Blessed art thou among women ... " Speed built up . The wall slid past . All she could see was cliff face , and the clouds below . Falling ever faster , she spread her arms and legs as wide as she could , trying to get maximum drag from her prison coveralls . " And blessed is the fruit of thy womb , Elvis . " Wind whipped at her , tearing tears from her eyes . Clouds rushed up at her . Whoever was behind this had better act now . Unless this was some unnecessarily elaborate plot to kill her . Blindly obeying some bug - just because it let her out of her cell - no longer seemed the obvious thing to do . But what choice did she have ? Lethal injection or a long fall ? Hardly fair . Llenor hit the first cloud layer . Cliffs disappeared . Engulfed in silent gray mist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except for the nagging reminders from her navmatrix . She shot out the bottom of the cloud bank , and there they were . A pair of rocs plunged toward her in a stoop , wings back , matching her speed . Rocs were bred from condors ages ago on Old Earth - but their broad twenty-meter wings , big braincases , and tall aquiline beaks gave them the look of eagles . Clutched in their claws was a life line , with a rigger 's harness clipped to it . The giant birds swung the line her way . Llenor caught it . The rocs pulled out of their stoop , wings beating , taking the tension as evenly as they could . It still felt like Llenor 's arms were jerked from their sockets . Shoulders aching , hands ripped raw from catching the cable , she struggled into the rigger 's harness , letting her full body take the strain . She was off . Free and away . Her navmatrix was getting no signals that sounded like pursuit . Did anyone even know she was gone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some winged shepherds herding geese . The rocs turned downwind , leaving the tip of the Archipelago behind . Ahead a sea of clouds spread out for thousands of klicks - the Great Reach . Llenor felt an instinctive surge of panic , setting out on a voyage airships and solarplanes seldom attempted-relying on nothing but a pair of strange rocs . ( " On my way , grandling , " Gramma Lisa announced . " TWO-TWO-ZERO to you , about 200 klicks out . " ) She had taken the Prinzess Lisa-Marie downwind to escape Port Myrine , then worked her way back up the lee side of the Archipelago . But it would take a while to run down a pair of rocs with the wind at their backs . ( " Llenor should turn the birds around , " Lucifer suggested . " Bring " em back our way . " ) ( " No ! Do n't startle them , " Evie shouted . ) Llenor ignored the conflicting advice . Someone had taken huge pains to get her off Jailhouse Rock . The bug . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rocs had to be headed somewhere . She bet they would arrive long before anyone caught up . Straining her eyes , she looked for some sign of a ship out over the clouds , spotting a black dot directly downsun . Prospero 's glare kept her from making a positive ID . The rocs beat nearer . It was not an airship . The dot grew into a floating platform . Not a big aerostadt , but a little sky island - taut helium tanks supporting a bamboo pavilion braced by gaily colored lines . Tall cumulus clouds in the background made it look like a tiny piece of heaven , somehow come adrift , floating out over the Great Reach . The rocs set her down on the woven path leading to the pavilion . Lienor looked about . A baby hippogriff clung to a nearby roost , terrified by the two big carnivorous birds . " Do n't let them eat the griff , " ordered a soft authoritative voice . Llenor turned toward the pavilion , to find herself staring down the barrel of a recoilless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from above the hand cannon . " Shoo off the rocs , " she ordered . " I promised the people who lent me this place they would not eat the griff . " Llenor waved the rocs away . They flapped off , circling overhead , then setting down on the far side of the pavilion . Rocs readily obey , but tender young hippogriff is always a temptation . The 20mm pistol stayed aimed straight at Lienor . " Did you kill her ? " Amanda demanded . " Kill who ? " Llenor was honestly unsure of who she was supposed to have killed this time . " Kia . " " No . But I saw her die . " Sort of . Lienor had been busy being blinded and thrown by the blast . Amanda nodded . " Wanted to hear you say it . If I thought you had , you 'd be taking ten steps back . " Wind whistled off the edge of the floating island , two meters behind Lienor - with the superheated surface far below . " Can I put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded enthusiastically . " Great . I hate talking over a gun . Unless I absolutely have to . " Holstering the pistol , she held out her hand . The electronic scorpion hopped off Llenor and onto her . Tucking the bug away , she invited Lienor into the pavilion . A porcelain tea set sat on fresh tatami mats . Amanda poured green tea for both of them , saying , " Tell me what you did do . " Llenor told her , starting from when Amanda disappeared into the Port Master 's gig - describing her tour of Port Myrine , and her visits to Graceland , and Lemnki Settlement . Amanda was amazingly easy to talk to , with her warm smile and stunning looks . It was like telling your troubles to a 3V star . Even with a pistol to her head , and a sheer drop at her back , Lienor had not been overly frightened . Amanda was that beautiful . When Llenor got to her date with Bell , Amanda laughed . " So that 's where he disappeared to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can just see him panting with charm . Bet he treated you to apricot lassi . " " How do you know ? " " Tried it on me . It hides an aphrodisiac . Do n't you just love having a CO who thinks with his pecker " Llenor tried to say it was not like that , describing the flying lessons , and the flight to the skyhook ... " Right . Why do you think we 're called Banshees ? We 're an airborne unit . He had his wings before you were hatched . " Llenor stared at Amanda over her tea cup , stunned and hurt . Feeling the emptiness under the pavilion . She loved Bell . Still mourned for him . He could have had her honestly . Amanda reached out , stroking her cheek . " Do n't blame the bastard . You 're a real peach . " Her hand came to rest on Lienor 's shoulder , giving a squeeze , and staying there . Llenor felt confused but comforted . " Thanks for getting me off that rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out of the local lock-up is a standard Banshee exercise . Bell firmly believed that he - or someone important to him - was bound to wind up behind bars . It just happened to be you . " " I still owe you , " Llenor insisted . " And wish I could pay you back . " " You will . " Amanda said it without the slightest doubt . Really ? How ? Amanda 's hand was still on her shoulder , and Lienor was unsure what to say next . She was not used to sharing small windblown platforms with the likes of Ensign Amanda . It must have showed . Amanda laughed , lifting her hand away . " Do n't get your clit in an uproar . I do n't do virgins . " Llenor had just explained how she was not a virgin - but with Amanda men clearly did not count . " All I care about is finding who killed Kia . I do n't much care why but I want to know who . " Amanda 's tone made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How can I help ? " She very much wanted to do something for Ensign Amanda-this gun-wielding lesbian angel who had handed Lienor her life back . " I need a ship , " Amanda admitted cheerfully . " And right now one is burning heavy hydrogen to get to you . " Gramma Lisa was gunning the reactor to get there , sending Lienor a steady stream of position fixes . " Ever since the blast , Port Myrine has been zipped tight , with the Banshees locked down , confined to barracks and brothels - but still drawing pay from the Helium Works . A sign someone thinks guns are going to be useful , despite having the " mad bomber safely behind bars . " Amanda was plainly amused by the notion Lienor could have caused all this havoc . " And last midwatch the Archipelago Packet came down from Freeport . Now she 's leaving with a sealed cargo . No passengers . No regular freight . Something special is aboard , headed for the Freeport beanstalk and Paira-Dice geosync station . The first shipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this sounded intriguing . " But what can I do ? " She could not so much as show her face anywhere on the Archipelago . Amanda gave a winsome grin . " I have to know what is being secretly hustled offplanet . That 's why I 'm AWOL , and you 're uncaged . We 're going to hijack the Archipelago Packet , to see what 's aboard . " Of course . Having added unlawful escape and armed flight to her list of crimes , hijacking had to be next . Amanda had a pair of saddles stashed in the pavilion . Mounting the rocs , they flew out to meet the Lisa-Marie . Gramma Lisa aimed the airship into the wind , with her hangar doors open . Lienor 's roc flew straight in , and she dismounted on the hangar deck . Wishing she had never left . Amanda landed behind her . Evie was there to greet them . So was Wahtsoph-ki . And Lucifer and Lilith . They had a mini-reunion in front of the huge rocs , who sat preening themselves , waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been taken care of on the ride in . Some disgruntled family members demanded a vote , but Llenor vetoed it . " The Prinzess is already forfeit under Settler Law . Lost to the family . And I need her . " There was nothing left to vote on . Amanda got Lienor off Jailhouse Rock . If she wanted them to fly her to Alpha C , or seize the Archipelago Packet - the only question was how ? " Long Gap , " Gramma Lisa decided . " That 's the place to stop the Packet . " ) Long Gap was a 100 klick break in the mountain chain about a third of the way up the Archipelago . " Why there ? " Lenor was still new to crime . ( " The Packet has to beat her way high up to windward to shoot the gap . We 'll be waiting . " Spoken like a true pirate . " Sounds good . " Actually it sounded difficult and dangerous , but Llenor saw no percentage in saying so . " We 'll need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangar deck , looking like she did not believe what she saw . Some Chimps , a Thal , two unheavenly twins , and a little edition of Llenor . Not exactly a picked squad of Banshees . " We 've still got the Bugs , " Llenor suggested . " We had the Bugs , " Lilith corrected her . " They 're dying , " Lucifer explained . " Mostly dead , " Lilith declared . Listening to the Twins could be like taking a one-two punch . " None of them have eaten since the Hive Queen blew up . " " Or moved much , " Lucifer added . " Gramma Lisa is livelier , " Lilith assured them . " But we still have their weapons . " A hold full of small arms clearly excited Lucifer . Llenor looked to Amanda . " How many boarders do we need ? " " Six or seven . Five if they are good . " Evie was out . And Llenor did not want Lilith and Lucifer in any uncontrolled situations . That left only her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chimps . " First she had a word with Wah-tsoph-ki . Thals usually avoided CroMagnon conflicts  --  knowing from grim experience that whichever side won , they were likely to lose . Under Settler Law , any non-humans involved in violence against Homosapiens were destroyed with less fuss than Llenor got . But Wah-tsoph-ki had been with the family all his life . And trusted Llenor . He signed he would do what she wanted . Pan troglodytes supreme had even less reason to side with humans . The two dozen SuperChimps aboard the Prinzess Lisa-Marie were a family group-five males , seven females , the rest adolescents , juveniles , and infants . Only the adult males would be adventurous enough for what Amanda had in mind . Llenor ignored the oldest , who was past his prime and did not stand watches . She made her pitch to the beta-male ; always more aggressive , more game to prove himself . The Chimp consented , bringing along a buddy . Lienor had her boarding party . Amanda grimaced . " They 'll have to do . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving them time to rest and get ready . Gramma Lisa worked her way along the leeward side of the Archipelago , staying in the radar shadow of the peaks . The Packet 's slow schedule let her fix her moment . When that moment arrived , Llenor got into her wings and went to the upper deck . Amanda borrowed Evie 's wings , and mounted the two daring Chimps on her rocs . Wah-tsoph-ki readied a paraglider on the hangar deck . ( " Here she comes . " Gramma Lisa spotted their prey emerging from the ground scatter as she approached the gap . ) The Archipelago Packet was a twin-boomed glider , with hugely long solar-paneled wings . She plied up and down the Dayside Archipelago riding the standing wave . The big solar-assisted sailplane would have to work her way high upwind to cross Long Gap . Fixed thermals partway across allowed her to regain altitude and recharge her solar collectors . Gramma Lisa waited until the Packet was into the gap and mounting the first thermal , then dumped ballast . The airship shot upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lienor opened her mouth and yelled to equalize pressure in her ears . No solarplane could match the Lisa-Marie in a roaring climb . They swiftly had the Packet half a klick beneath them , her big solar-driven propellers flailing at the thinning air . Rocs took off with their Chimps aboard . Then Llenor followed Amanda over the side , folding her wings into a stoop , ignoring frantic calls from their target  --  letting Gramma Lisa reel out a line of bullshit . ( " The Captain has left the bridge . Please give your name and message . The next available human will answer all calls in the order ... " ) Llenor 's navmatrix locked on for landing , reading off the dwindling distance . 400 meters. 300 meters. 200 meters ... The Packet 's primary control position was on an airfoil section between the two fuselage booms . Flaring out her wings and lowering her tail , Llenor stalled at the last instant . Adhesive boots hit the wing section and she told them to hold . She had boarded the Packet . Amanda landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Together they attacked the tear-drop canopy protecting the main control position . Thrown into defensive mode , the Packet did a wingover , spinning on her central axis . Crouched over the canopy , held in place by her boots , Lienor saw clouds and sky whirling out the corner of her eye . Ignoring the spin , Amanda cut through the canopy . Lienor reached in , disabling the autopilot and security system , plugging a transceiver into the control circuit . Instantly her navmatrix was flying the Packet . Putting the controls in neutral , she leveled off . The Packet ceased spinning , climbing back into the thermal . Amanda hefted her torch . " Let 's see what we got . " " Passenger side first . " Llenor nodded at the port boom . Amanda clumped over and started cutting . Llenor compensated , keeping the glider on an even keel . The rocs with their armed Chimps aboard took up stations on either wing , ready to give covering fire . Wahtsoph-ki positioned his paraglider behind the Packet . As soon as she had cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " triggering a gas grenade . " Take over , bosun , " Llenor ordered , letting Wah-tsoph-ki fly both gliders from his tail position . She shrugged off her wings . Kneeling to steady herself , she aimed a laser glove at the hole in the port boom . Slipping a gas mask over her face , Amanda tossed in the grenade . And a second . White irritating vapor boiled out of the port boom , forming a billowing plume behind the big glider . Wah-tsoph-ki had to fall off to starboard to keep flying both ships . Whenever the plume slackened , Amanda stoked it with another grenade . " They 're coming out , " Amanda shouted through the mask . Climbing atop the boom to give Lienor a clear shot , Amanda reached down into the smoke , grabbing an emerging figure by the jacket . The man was wearing a mask , but the burning vapor must have gotten under his clothes . No one could hold out in a confined space full of really nasty gas . " How many are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you are dead . " " Only me , " he gasped . Amanda tore off his mask , making sure he got a whiff of the gas-to make him more tractable . Then she pulled him out . He clung sputtering to the smooth airfoil , held there by Amanda . If she so much as relaxed her grip , he would go sailing off between the booms . It was Bell . Seeing him through the sights of her laser glove , Lienor hardly believed it at first . She let the glove fall - overcome with relief . He was alive . " Keep him covered , " Amanda screamed . " The bastard may have backup in there . " Llenor hesitated , her happiness at seeing Bell crowded out by serious questions . How had he survived ? What was he doing here ? Reluctantly she raised her glove , but doubted she could fire . Bell was not some deranged Bug . He was the man she loved . There was bound to be an explanation . Keeping Bell pulled back and off balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick peek into the passenger boom . She jerked her head back out . " No one . " Ripping off her mask , Amanda drew her machine pistol , jamming it against the back of Bell 's head . Amanda 's small body shook with rage . White knuckles gripped the recoilless pistol . " No witnesses . Right ? You killed Kia , did n't you - and meant to get clean away ? You sorry son-ofa-bitch . " Clearly Bell had escaped the bomb , but how ? Llenor remembered the blinding flash before the blast . And Kia crumpled at the lock door . There had been a moment when Bell could have dived inside the armored box , leaving the bloody helmet as a dramatic bit of misdirection . All Lienor could think to say was , " Why ? " Her question was addressed to Amanda , but Bell 's lips curved into a familiar smile . " Someone 's got to stop you . " He said it slowly and simply . Just as if it made sense . Lienor stared at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're sick . Dealing with Bugs . Living with Chimps . Fucking Thals . Making half-breed monsters . " Unable to speak , Llenor felt almighty sick . Just like Bell said . Thinking about " traces of nitrates on your clothes and body . " Not to mention the primer and detonator in her cuff . Bell drew his legs under him , getting back his balance . " Surprised that I fucked some test-tube bitch ? Do n't take it personal . I did what I had to . " Llenor 's finger twitched inside her laser glove . He looked over his shoulder at Amanda . " Someone has to save us . This planet was made for humans - like you and me . " " And Ria . You hypocritical asshole . " Amanda looked over at Lienor . " I vote we get it over with . Grease him now . " " No , wait ! " Lienor lowered her glove . " Why ? " Amanda looked genuinely puzzled . " We 've got to take him back . " " What for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Do you think he did this alone ? We need to waste him now ! " " No ! " Llenor insisted . She wanted to shove Bell into their smug Settler faces . The man they claimed she killed . The Xenophobe that did not exist . " We need to take him back . " " That 's one thing you 'll never do . " Bell twisted about , slipping out of his jacket , spoiling Amanda 's aim . Before she could recover , he dived backward between the booms . Llenor lunged to grab him . Too late . The slipstream whipped him out of reach . Bell lay on his back , sprawled in midair , then he curled himself into a ball to speed his fall . Headed straight for the fiery surface . " Damn ! " Amanda sat crouched atop the passenger boom , holding Bell 's empty jacket-watching him dwindle , becoming a dot on the cloud plain . " Say hello to Elvis , you fucker . " The rocs dived after him . But with heavy Chimps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seize someone who did not want to be grabbed . Bell disappeared into the clouds below . Slowly the rocs came circling back . Prospero stands high over Mount Aphrodite  --  higher even than over Myrine-basking the great emerald peak in eternal summer . Flocks of fat doves circled the summit . Migrating silverwings streamed past , headed sunward . Lienor was not on Aphrodite proper , but on Cythera , a separate pinnacle that served as a port for Aphrodite . She and the Prinzess LisaMarie were barred from the peak . Not because the ship was forfeit , and she was wanted for terrorism , murder , assault , sabotage , mayhem , escaping detention - and now hijacking the Archipelago Packet . But because all armed vessels were barred from the Mountain of Love . It was just as well . Aphrodite was absorbed in a ten-day ritual . Revelers scampered over the green slopes , searching out sacred mushrooms and screwing under the sun . Llenor was hardly in the mood . And there was work to do . The Prinzess was refitting , taking on water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross the Great Reach . There was nowhere for her crew to go now except sunward , to the Subsolar Plateau . Putting themselves beyond the reach of Settler Law . Amanda was going with them - having added aiding and abetting to going AWOL . She stood watching as Lienor personally put the final touch on the Prinzess 's refit . Using her adhesive boots , Llenor climbed up and painted over the " z " in Prinzess , replacing it with a " c . " So it read Princess Lisa-Marie . Amanda smiled at the forbidden spelling . " It is bad enough having to turn outlaw , without telling the whole world . " Lienor climbed down to stand beside Amanda , getting a better look at her handiwork . Pleased by the illegal English spelling , she told Amanda , " That 's what I want to do . I want to tell the world . "
