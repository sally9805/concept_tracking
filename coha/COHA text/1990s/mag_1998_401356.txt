Our female test force seeks out skis that are strong enough for a man , but made for a woman . // IT WAS STEEP , IT WAS ROCKY , it was under A-Basin 's Palivacinni lift . It was a no-fall zone . With so many awesome-skiing locals watching , if you fell , you would surely die of embarrassment . Nobody died . In fact , as we nipped through narrow slots in the trees , made springy fall-line turns down the steeps , and launched mini-airs off boulders and big bumps , we heard hoots of praise from above . Since each of us had grabbed our favorite test boards , we wondered if the acclaim was for the skiers or the skis . The women 's ski test this year was no picnic , though it was supposed to be . A-Basin in the spring is known for its beach scene : tailgates in the parking lot , barbecues , beer , tunes , even lawn chairs . Instead , the wind howled , the sky went black , and the heavens spit great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ created ideal conditions for testing . We skied bumps , steeps , and flats , in velvety powder and tracked-up nasties , on crusty hard snow and soft corduroy . All in one 1,305-vertical-foot run .

Testers take a burger break on A-Basin 's beachfront ( inset ) . // In two days , we tested 18 skis designed specifically for women-roughly 300,000 vertical feet of testing . There was a range of suitability levels and an assortment of shapes in the test batch , from the pudgy Olin Sierra V to the shapely Atomic BetaCarvX 9.18L to the skinny-waisted Elan X-Tech Phantom L. Our test squad was varied , too : ski instructors , ex-racers , a token @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning screws and flipping burgers . With so many variables , it 's not surprising that different testers liked different skis , which means it 's key to demo skis before you plunk down any coin . So , aside from the scramble for the popular Volant PowerKarve L , there was little fighting over skis when we headed for the no-fall zone . And after successfully risking our fragile female egos , we sat on tailgates in the driving blizzard and chowed burgers and brats . Testing never tasted so good .
