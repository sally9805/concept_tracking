Julia Porras was 13 years old when Japanese troops kidnapped her from her home in a southern Philippine village . Imprisoned in a tunnel , she was raped by four to five soldiers every day for eight months . It was 1944 , a year before the end of World War II . Porras told no one of what had been done to her during those months  --  a silence she would maintain for the next 48 years . Then in 1992 , after another Filipina publicly recounted a similar experience , Porras knew that it was time to speak . In 1982 , Minda Pascual was 16 years old and impoverished when she began working as a go-go dancer in one of the bars fronting Subic Bay Naval Station , the headquarters of the U.S. Naval Force in the Philippines . Whenever a Navy ship was docked at the base , Pascual had sex with four or five servicemen daily ; each man paid the bar owner $10 for her , of which she was given a small fraction . When the U.S. announced it would close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would no longer be able to support her two children  --  who had been fathered by U.S. servicemen . She decided that it was time to speak . Porras , abducted during wartime occupation , and Pascual , exploited during peacetime occupation , offer markedly different personal histories . But coming at the same time , their stories create an echo that can no longer be ignored . Going public has its risks ; Philippine society considers prostituted women a lower life form and rape an act that shames the victim more than the rapist . But Pascual and Porras have joined the scores of women whose revelations are forcing official acknowledgment of more than a half century of military sexual slavery in the Philippines . Whether their labor was coerced or purchased , thousands of Filipinas had little chance of escape . In the case of Japan , there had been long-standing denial of a policy of conscripting women for sexual service during World War II . The government claimed that the " comfort stations , " as the rape camps were called , were run by private citizens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced to change its story after three Korean former " comfort women " filed a compensation suit in 1991 . Kim Hak Sun , the only woman to use her name , was the first to publicly recount her experience . Japan subsequently acknowledged its role in establishing " comfort stations "  --  but continued to deny that the women were forced to provide sex . International media attention and pressure from activists prompted then Philippine President Corazon C. Aquino to follow up on reports that Filipinas had been forced to be " comfort women " during Japan 's occupation . But the government-appointed investigator concluded in 1992 that no large-scale forced prostitution had taken place in the Philippines  --  had it been otherwise , the report contended , Filipino guerrillas would have killed the rapists . The government dismissed the allegations . In response , Filipina activists hit the airwaves  --  making radio appeals to former " comfort women , " urging them to identify themselves by calling a special hotline . Within months , five women had responded ; some of them told their stories at press conferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest at the Japanese embassy . In August 1993 , after almost two years of ongoing revelations by former " comfort women " throughout the Asia-Pacific region , Japan finally apologized for a system of sexual slavery perpetrated by its Imperial Army before and during World War II . It is estimated that there were as many as 200,000 " comfort women , " 80 percent of them from Korea ; women were also abducted , the government conceded , from China , Indonesia , Japan , the Philippines , and Taiwan . Many of the women died from disease or starvation after being abandoned in remote areas ; others were killed . " We want to reveal everything that happened to us , " said 70-year-old Anastasia Cortes , a Filipina . Imprisoned by the Japanese for six months and repeatedly raped , she also had to watch soldiers torture her husband . " It 's not easy to keep telling my story , " Cortes said . " But I do n't want what happened to me to happen again . I want a taste of justice before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a garrison in Manila , one of several " comfort stations " in the archipelago . In addition to enduring daily sexual assaults , the kidnapped women were made to cook , clean , and massage officers . " I knew nothing about sex , " said Julia Porras . " I wept and wept because of the pain . My body shook , I passed out . Every day , different soldiers came to rape me . That whole time , my vagina was bloody and swollen and all I had was a towel to cover myself . " Whether young or old , single or married , all were powerless as poor women in a defeated nation . But liberation from the Japanese did not end their suffering . Early in her marriage , Porras would scream when her husband approached her . Beatings left another former " comfort woman , " Gertrude Balisalisa , with a nerve disorder ; her husband abandoned her  --  not wanting " the leavings of the Japanese "  --  and took their children to the U.S. Repeated rapes destroyed Francisca Napeza Austari 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or relatives who understood , leaving many of them with little emotional or financial support . Decades later , the women finally have advocates : the grass-roots-based Task Force on Filipino Victims of Military Sexual Slavery has joined an international campaign to attain financial compensation for those who are still alive . Last March , 18 Filipinas filed a class action suit in Tokyo against the Japanese government . The suit , in addition to demanding compensation , calls on the Japanese government to apologize to the women individually . Japan has so far rejected all compensation requests . The women have received little help from the Philippine government ; most legislators have discussed the issue primarily in terms of national pride . Reparations were owed , said one senator , not to the women but to " the Filipino people . " And between the Philippine and Japanese governments , there has been talk of establishing a nebulous " foundation for Filipinas "  --  a way for President Fidel V. Ramos to let Japan duck individual compensation requests . ( The Philippine government is wary of offending one of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regained control over its military bases in the Philippines , which had been in Japanese hands . Clark Air Base and Subic Bay Naval Station , located in an overpopulated and tiny archipelago , became the U.S. 's largest overseas military bases . During the Vietnam war , the Philippines became a " rest and recreation " center non pareil , where $10 could purchase the house specialty : lunch , cold beer , and oral sex under the table provided by a woman on her hands and knees . By the late 1960s , the Philippines was hosting approximately 10,000 servicemen daily . It is estimated some 55,000 women  --  called " little brown fucking machines " by sailors  --  were eventually working as prostitutes . Government officials were more circumspect , calling the women " entertainers " and " hospitality girls " as a way of getting around the fact that prostitution is illegal in the Philippines . They had little interest in curbing an industry that , by the mid-1980s , was worth $500 million . It was Olongapo , a small fishing village surrounded by Subic 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model " comfort station . " Even after 1959 , when the base was made smaller and the village was no longer officially on its grounds , Olongapo 's clubs , bars , massage parlors , and restaurants were managed as an extension of the base 's operations . Many were owned by Navy retirees who , in cooperation with the Philippine authorities and entrepreneurs , provided U.S. servicemen with Filipinas ' sexual labor as part of their tours of duty . As the years went on , the Navy perfected the Olongapo operation : it set up clinics , where the women were licensed and monitored for sexually transmitted diseases . After they were checked , the women were issued " sexual health IDs " that had to be produced on demand by U.S. military police and the women 's customers . The fact that the Navy clinics offered almost no birth control information or supplies reflects the military 's rejection of any accountability  --  where women are concerned  --  for the actions of the men under its control . Indeed , it was the women that the bar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner for the " hospitality girl " of his choice , and the woman would be issued a receipt  --  proof of purchase  --  and given a small commission . The women were prevented by the military police from soliciting the sailors independently . Many of them remained indebted to the bar owners , who would lend them money when there were no ships at the base . The cycle of poverty and abuse remained , for the most part , unbroken . The system in Olongapo was so successful that it was replicated in Angeles , the village closest to Clark Air Base , and at U.S. military bases in South Korea and Okinawa . Raped by her stepfather , Minda Pascual had no recourse but to leave home at age 16 and support herself . She arrived in Olongapo with no intentions of becoming a " bar girl . " But after she spent endless days eating rice gruel , all that she could afford on her waitress ' salary , her friends warned her she 'd die of hunger if she did n't solicit sailors . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose since she was no longer a virgin and her parents did n't want her back . Pascual started as a dancer , earning about a dollar a night dancing in a bikini . Her first " client " was a young serviceman who paid the club owner a steady fee so that he could have her every day . In three months , she was pregnant and the man promised to help . When the baby was born , he offered money but only if he could take the child with him to the U.S. Though heavily in debt and with her bed already in hock to pay the rent , she refused . Pascual returned to work , pulling 24-hour shifts whenever a Navy ship was in town . " Early in the morning , I 'd be in the streets already , waiting for clients , " she said . " In the afternoon , I 'd be in the club . When you 're with a customer , you ca n't sleep . You have to watch his every move ; you have to make sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the time . You can not imagine what sort of men these were . Some would do all sorts of things to you , the moment you sat down with them . " Sometimes the men beat her ; one drunken serviceman tried to strangle her . Pascual earned up to $200 a week when a ship was in . Then business would be slow for weeks afterward ; she 'd borrow money until the next ship docked . In her ten years as a " bar girl , " she never managed to save . In emergencies , such as when she needed an abortion  --  which is illegal  --  she pawned her bed . In 1987 , Pascual was engaged to a 19-year-old serviceman , but when she got pregnant , he too abandoned her and denied paternity . She filed charges against him before the Navy tribunal in Subic . A Navy prosecutor came to convince her to drop the charges . When she refused , he offered to help if she would sleep with him . " I was heavy with child , " Pascual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months pregnant and you still want to use me ? " Broke , Pascual had to resume working at the bar two weeks after giving birth . After blood tests confirmed the serviceman 's paternity , he signed an agreement to provide $100 a month in child support . But the money stopped when he left the Navy . Since the 1950s , Filipinos have protested the U.S. bases . But objections to the bases were couched primarily in terms of national sovereignty , the nuclear threat , and other geopolitical considerations . Not until GABRIELA , a coalition of 100 women 's groups , was founded in 1984 did the protests begin to address the social costs of the bases to the Philippines . In 1991 , the Philippine Senate rejected the U.S. 's request for a new lease on Subic , and months later the base closed . ( Clark had already been slated for closure by the Pentagon . ) As a result , thousands of women , considered pariahs by other Filipinos , lost their livelihood and the means to support their children , many of whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children , the mother is the sole provider , and more likely than not , she has had little education and no work experience apart from the bars . Pascual said she " knocked on doors , asking people if I could do their laundry , just so I could buy a kilo of rice for my children . I thought I would die . " The Amerasian children are as ostracized as their mothers . " In school , other children tease them , saying , ' You 're an American , you 're not one of us , why do n't you go home ? ' " said 36-year-old Adora Largosa . Relatives and neighbors consider the children reminders of their mothers ' " sins . " The mothers themselves have an uneasy relationship with the children . " When we 're riding a bus , the other passengers give us curious looks , " said Largosa . " I told my children to stop calling me Mama before other people . When strangers see a woman with half-white children , they conclude that she came from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olongapo called a press conference in front of the U.S. embassy and issued a statement : " We are women working in the entertainment sector in Olongapo . Like the vast majority of our sisters in Angeles , rural and urban poverty and limited alternatives for disadvantaged women in need of employment have led us to this work . Our labor has been directly responsible for the financial gains of entertainment establishments and of profiteers ... we are mothers raising children alone , and under situations of extreme difficulty . Thousands of them are children of American military servicemen . " Approximately 50,000 children have been fathered by U.S. servicemen in the Philippines over the past five decades . U.S. occupation of the territories of Olongapo and Angeles , unlike Japanese occupation of the Philippines , lasted long enough for a second generation of women , themselves fathered by U.S. servicemen , to join the sex industry . For Brenda David , now 38 years old , the journey to the bars began at age 14 , when her father returned to the U.S. , leaving her and her mother without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings , she went to Olongapo and started out as a cashier , but gradually moved toward prostitution . She eventually bore a son by a sailor ; when the bases closed in 1992 , the father returned to the U.S. , leaving David and her son , Tyson , without support . In March 1993 , two women who had worked in Olongapo and four Amerasian children , aided by local women 's organizations , filed a class action suit against the U.S. government in the Federal Court of Claims in Washington , D.C. The suit asked for financial support for the care , education , and health needs of 8,600 children , at an estimated cost of $3.9 million per year or a total of $68 million until the children reach 18 years old . The suit stated that a de facto contract had existed between the women and the Navy , citing the pre-1959 history of Olongapo as a base preserve and the Navy 's support of the bar system after 1959 . The U.S. government moved for dismissal in July 1993 , arguing that while such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the Navy left Subic . A court decision was pending at press time . The women and children have n't received much more than lip service from the Philippine government . Assistance promised by Aquino 's government never materialized ; Ramos ' only official response was to establish a working group in December of 1992 to survey the number of Amerasian children . For both the former " hospitality girls " and " comfort women , " the struggle to gain recognition of their needs and control of their lives continues . They know that whatever money comes down the pipeline , it will do little to compensate for the horrors and deprivation they have already suffered . But from their inception , these campaigns have been about much more than money . Both efforts have their roots in a burgeoning women 's human rights movement in the Philippines and around the world .
