<p> Ellis Island prepares to reopen its doors as a national museum , and offers up a moving trove of photographs from past and present <p> The pictures , some old , some recent , tell the story : it was like dying and trying to enter heaven , except that Saint Peter had been replaced by an examiner from the Bureau of Immigration , and the angels had given way to Marine Hospital Service doctors armed with pieces of chalk . Filing into an enormous room devoted to the registering of souls , suppliants were marked with a revelatory code . Those who were branded with symbols such as E , H , Pg , X or X with a circle around it would then be plucked from line and held for further examination . <p> This alphabet of obstacles translated into E for eye diseases , H for heart problems , Pg for pregnancy , X for mental retardation , and X with a circle around it for insanity-all potentially excludable conditions . The initial " six-second medical " administered by doctors watching applicants walk upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judgment was swift ! <p> Often at the rate of one person every two minutes , those deemed to be of sound mind and body would step up to a desk for their final examination . What is your name ? ( Not an obvious question ! Did a newcomer tell the inspector that the name written on the ship 's manifest Iying in front of him was missing half its syllables ? Probably not . ) Who paid for your passage ? I did ! How much money do you have ? Twenty-five dollars ! Do you have a job in America ? ( Another tricky question . The correct answer was no . Contract laborers were excluded , but so too was anyone likely to become a " public charge . " ) More questions kept coming . Are you a polygamist , an anarchist ? No ! Never ! Not me ! <p> The list of categories for exclusion grew longer every year . Beginning in 1875 with Chinese laborers , it mushroomed to include lunatics and idiots , those suffering from " loathsome " diseases , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an eye disease that often resulted in blindness . By 1917 , barriers had been put up against 33 classes of people , including alcoholics , prostitutes , pimps and the illiterate . <p> But no matter how many tricky questions and exclusions they faced , an ever-increasing number of people crossed the Atlantic to knock on America 's gate . In 1892 , the year Ellis Island opened as an immigration station , nearly half a million people passed through the Port of New York . Fifteen years later , the number had jumped to more than a million a year . In 1907 , on one record day 11,747 immigrants were processed through Ellis island . " We were simply swamped by that human tide , " said an interpreter on the inspection line . " This ranging and guiding and hurrying and sifting , " observed a British immigrant fresh out of steerage , " was like nothing so much as the screening of coal in a great breaker tower . " <p> During the flood-tide years from 1900 to 1914 , a massive outpouring of Italians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them Jews fleeing pogroms  --  abandoned their farms and villages in Southern and Eastern Europe . Leaving behind poverty and oppression , they were the westward cargo for steamship companies . Ellis Island was staffed by hundreds of officials and interpreters who spoke 30 languages among them , but even this was at times inadequate to the Babel of tongues washing over the island . <p> Robert Louis Stevenson said that only the failures left home . Others claimed the opposite : the immigrants were the strongest , most adventuresome of the lot . But in the 1920s , when quotas were placed on the number of people admitted to the United States , nativist sentiment would succeed in ending one of the great migrations in modern history . <p> A brief flurry of arrivals at Ellis Island preceded our entry into World War II , and another flurry , including displaced persons , followed it , but because of the quota laws and the fact that the processing of immigrants was now done abroad , fewer came through Ellis . By the time the island was closed in 1954 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detention center for enemy aliens and for those whose papers were not in order , and as a deportation center for Wobblies , Reds , anarchists and other suspect radicals . <p> Still , the fact remains that 12 million of the 16 million immigrants who entered New York Harbor between 1892 and 1954 traversed what came to be known as the " Isle of Tears . " ( Up until the mid- ' 20s most first- and second-class passengers were spared the indignity of being " processed " at Ellis Island ; they disembarked directly onto the piers of Manhattan . ) Many families had terrible experiences <p> " Ellis Island was a very contradictory place , full of tears and sorrow , " my aunt , Katherine Bachenheimer , told me when I asked her about my family 's experience on the island . " People were pushed around a lot , their names changed , families separated . If you write about it , promise me you 'll tell this side of the story along with all the successes . " <p> As many as 2 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellis Island were denied entry and were deported , while some of those admitted probably later wished that they had never left home . Katherine 's mother , for example  --  my paternal grandmother  --  would die young of tuberculosis and galloping consumption in a Lower East Side tenement . Hers was not one of the success stories that can be found among the estimated 100 million or so Americans  --  40 percent of the population  --  who trace their ancestry through Ellis Island . <p> When Klaus Schnitzer took his photography class at Montclair State College in New Jersey to Ellis Island in 1982 , this self-contained island world was in utter ruin . Three thousand people at a time had once been housed here , sometimes for weeks on end . Their graffiti , like the verses written in Greek- " When your fate is to pass from here , you will pass " ; their triple-tiered bunks ; their dinner plates , which had served up endless portions of soups and sandwiches ; and even the dust of people 's footprints could still be found , but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken glass and the rubble of collapsing roofs . <p> Schnitzer told his students to focus not on whether Ellis Island " should be remembered as a symbol of hope or disappointment , but on the deeper mysteries of memory and the passage of time . " They succeeded brilliantly , and the operation expanded into a broader photo-documentation project that included a number of professional photographers . Schnitzer and Brian Feeney , his former student who now serves as the National Park Service photographer on Ellis Island , have assembled an exhibition of historic and contemporary photographs to mark the reopening of the immigration center as a national museum . <p> Before the buildings were in ruins the immigrants themselves inspired photographers . Lewis Hine and Alfred Eisenstaedt accumulated a wealth of scenes documenting the excitement , anxiety , boredom and confusion involved in the passage across Ellis Island . <p> The stage on which many of these photographic dramas are played is the island 's Main Building , the palatial red-brick structure that architectural historian Robert Twombly describes as having been " designed to intimidate while it inspired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be as grand as the refurbishing of Versailles or the Hermitage  --  this American immigrant palace will be the centerpiece of the new Ellis Island Immigration Museum . When its exhibitions are fully installed later this year , it will be one of New York 's largest museums . The number of visitors per day is expected to exceed the daily average for immigrants " processed " on the island during the peak years . The old baggage room , offices and processing rooms will be adapted for museum galleries . There will be an oral history center and a library . <p> Restored to the way it looked from 1918 to 1929 , the Registry Room will be left empty . It will serve without commentary as its own memorial . Bathed in light from arched windows overlooking the skyscrapers of Manhattan , yet shadowed with the memories of all the souls it once held , this vaulted chamber is still giving strong , even if ambiguous , instruction in the meaning of social justice in America . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Opposite : By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred Eisenstaed , few immigrants came through Ellis Island . But in 1905 , ferris waited to transport the thousands processed daily . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : After passing physical exams and answering endless questions , a group of immigrants , dressed in their best , walked to the ferry that would take them to New Jersey or Manhattan . There , they were at last free . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Files that contain stray papers left behind when Ellis Island was closed remained untouched in 1988 . <p> PHOTOS ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The Registry Room , or " great hall of judgment , " had deteriorated after decades of neglect when photographed in 1983 ( center ) . Nearly 12 million immigrants , waiting hours in lines and going from one examination to the next , passed through here . In 1911 , benches replaced iron railings so the weary could rest .

Lewis Hine was struck by the faces of newly arrived immigrants and made a number of portraits .
