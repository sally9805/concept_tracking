REAL ESTATE BROKER MAGGIE Dietrich never had a client like Bruce Willis . In a single day last summer , the actor went on the biggest shopping spree for land and buildings in the history of Penns Grove , N.J. , a down-at-the-heel , bluecollar town of 5,200 just across the river from Wilmington , Del . Dietrich sold Willis an 11-acre parcel on the Delaware River for $475,000 and the grandest stone house in town for $175,000 . But the purchase that Willis seemed to like best , the one that had him beaming , was the longvacant Penns Grove National Bank , which he picked up for just $65,000 . " He was opening up safe doors , just smiling ear-to-ear , " says Dietrich . At one point , she recalls , Willis jumped up on the dusty counter . " I said , " You like this ? ' ' " recalls Dietrich . " I do ! " he replied . Later Willis told Today 's Sunbeam , the local newspaper , that the bank is " something I have a connection to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mom used to work at that bank . " Photograph SOLD ! // Some people collect pictures of the places they have lived in ; Willis , 41 , collects the places themselves . He grew up with his sister and two brothers in neighboring Carney 's Point , next to his grandfather 's machine shop . He graduated from Penns Grove High School in 1973 , then left for Manhattan to take up acting . Now he 's back-with a fortune that 's grown by at least $35 million just over the past two years . To enhance his real estate portfolio , Willis agreed last February to buy a Victorian house and the town 's old library . The actor and his wife , actress Demi Moore , 33 , already have enough places to live , including a house in Malibu and a sprawling apartment overlooking New York City 's Central Park . So what 's up ? " I 'm an investor who has come home to the town where I grew up , " Willis said . He is also a man with a plan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Stubini 's South bar on Shell Road in Carney 's Point , he tooled off in a limo to the state capitol in Trenton to tell Gov . Christine Todd Whitman in a private meeting about his desire to spend $50 million in his old hometown . " Anytime someone 's proposing a $50 million development project in New Jersey , the governor is willing to listen , " says Whitman 's deputy press secretary Jayne Rebovich . Although no specifics were given , Willis envisions a new pier , a marina , restaurants and a park . Said Willis of the town-which has been on an economic slide since Interstate 295 bypassed Penns Grove in 1968 : " I 'd just like to see it come back to life . " Photograph Bruce brings blues bands to Hailey , including his own Accelerators ( with wife Demi Moore on backup . Photograph Willis ( in ' ' 73 ) was a " crazy guy " who liked to " streak " through Penns Grove , recalls local resident Rose Maurice . // Penns Grove leaders believe that if anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That is a pretty amazing figure , " says Mayor Paul Morris of the actor 's $50 million plan . Over at Stubini 's South , owner Stu Adams is equally elated . " For him to come back to his hometown is one thing , " says Adams . " But for him to put the money in here , it 's one hell of a boom . " Penns Grove is n't the first community that Willis has invested in . Back in 1986 he set his sights on Hailey , Idaho , a village of 5,000 , 12 miles south of Sun Valley , where he liked to visit . He began buying property , starting with a six-bedroom house on 48 acres near the Big Wood River , 20 miles away from homes owned by Clint Eastwood and Arnold Schwarzenegger . Six years later , in 1992 , Willis , who had married Moore in ' ' 87 , bought a $572,000 Victorian mansion in the center of Hailey as a surprise present for her 30th birthday . Today , she houses not only guests there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The response when I come home is almost embarrassing , " said Willis , who bought this house in Penns Grove for his father and set up an office for himself in the garage . // In 1994 , Willis bought half a block of vacant land just north of downtown Hailey as well as a strip of stores on Main Street , including a barbershop , a pizza joint and a blue-collar bar called the Mint . Later that year he added the Liberty movie theater , and in 1995 he purchased 800 acres of prairie land 60 miles out of town . He also began construction of the E.G. Willis office building , named after his grandfather , in the town center . With Willis 's investments in Hailey and nearby Ketchum reaching the $10 million mark , some residents have fretted about a " Planet Hollywood " makeover-a glitziness that would overwhelm the small-town charm . " What happens when he loses interest with Hailey and pulls out ? " wonders Julia Springer , a clerk at a clothing store across from the Mint . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far have found little to complain about . Willis and Moore have refurbished the 58-year-old Liberty , adding love seats in the balcony , and last December they hosted the world premiere there of Willis 's 12 Monkeys . The Mint , which reopened last summer after a $1.5 million renovation , now attracts performers such as Bo Diddley and B.B. King , as well as customers including local vacation-home owner Jamie Lee Curtis and , last New Year 's Eve , John F. Kennedy Jr. , who was visiting cousin Maria Shriver and her husband , Schwarzenegger . The town is a bit glitzier but hardly a tourist trap . And Willis is known locally as a solid citizen . " I 'm not doing any of this to make money , " he told the local Wood River Journal in 1994 . " My kids daughters Rumer , 7 , Scout , 4 , and Tallulah , 2 are going to grow up here , and I just wanted to make it a little nicer . " Last July 4 , he paid for the town 's fireworks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community hospital . Hailey architect Jon Marvel even credits Willis with " rescuing my mother " when she slipped on the ice a few winters back . Marvel says Willis drove his mother , Gee Elliott , and her dog to the hospital , then waited to hear that she would be all right . Photograph Right now , the view is pier-less along the Delaware River in Penns Grove , where Willis is planning a new marina . " He 's giving back to his hometown , " says Mayor Paul Morris . // Willis says he wants to avoid being seen as a Hollywood mogul , particularly in Penns Grove , where , he says , he would like to be treated " just as a kid from this town . " Of course , that wo n't be easy . Since late last year , when Willis moved his father , David , a retired factory worker , and his stepmother , Alma , to the stone house on Main Street from their trailer in Carney 's Point , their residence has become something of a tourist attraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California after she and David divorced . ) " I do n't have any privacy because people are always driving by , " Alma complained to neighbor Mary DeNicola . But Penns Grovers themselves are doing their best to maintain a respectable distance . " He does n't like people to fuss over him , " says Maryanne Di Marco , a co-owner of the Roman Pantry , where Willis recently bought four cheese-steak sandwiches , some pizzelles and cannolis . " We try to act like it 's no big deal , " says Di Marco . " But deep down , we 're dying ! " Sidebar In 1992 , Willis bought a $572,000 Victorian in downtown Haley as a birthday present for Moore , who uses it as a guest house and a museum for her vast doll collection . // <p>
