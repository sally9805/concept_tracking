Section : FICTION I 'd given up on understanding why I was doing the things I was . The other night I went out on my deck , it must have been after two in the morning , around two or three . It 's a big redwood deck that wraps around three sides of the house , upstairs and down . From my bedroom there 's a set of sliding glass doors , and I had gone out in my pajamas . I could n't sleep . I felt like some kind of creature . For the past week I 've been sleeping most of the day , and then I 'm up all night . Now it 's Saturday night , and I 'm waiting for Katrina 's friends to get here . Katrina 's up in her room getting ready . The other night , when I was out on the deck , first I just paced around . When I passed my daughter 's bedroom , on the opposite side of the house from mine , I looked in on her . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flung out like she was flying so high the atmosphere was thin and she had to struggle for air . She 's beautiful , Katrina . <p> Her looks are only one of the miraculous things about Katrina . I 'm downright ugly . I 've got one of those W. C. Fields noses , and black , bushy eyebrows that meet in a knot of hair at the bridge of my nose . Plus I 'm short , and I have a beer gut . My wife was no beauty either . Then here comes this kid who looks like an angel . Katrina has bright green eyes and thick strawberry-blond hair that she wears shoulder-length and that is always striking , the way it curls . She 's twelve years old now , three weeks away from thirteen . When she was five , she turned off some cartoons she was watching and said she would never watch television again because it was violent and sexist . She got the sexist from her room . Katrina 's never watched television since , but basically she 's just extremely bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to treat Katrina like his mom , even though she was only two years older than him . Anytime he had a serious question , he 'd go to Katrina . It made her mom jealous . <p> We never talk about Katrina 's mom and her brother . It 's been five years . I stopped thinking about it . That 's another miraculous thing about Katrina : how she 's dealt with it all . She was especially close to her mom . Alex adored her : there was none of the sibling tension you 'd expect between kids only a couple of years apart . Afterwards , I expected Katrina to act up . The doctors said to expect it . The way her seat belt restrained her may have kept her alive by keeping her from being thrown from the car , but it also tore her up inside , her inner organs . She was on the operating table for eight hours . She 's fine now . There was no permanent damage . <p> Katrina and me , we stayed alive . <p> I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only one who was n't hurt at all . <p> We were coming back from a party . I was fooling around behind the wheel , making everyone laugh , turning off the lights to make the kids squeal , swerving to make them scream . Everyone was laughing . We were having a good time . They trusted me . They trusted me enough to let me scare them without really being scared  --  because they believed I would never do anything really stupid , really dangerous . <p> But I did . I missed a curve . <p> Now Katrina wants to go out on a date . This request is followed by the announcement that she 's going steady with Jamie and that she loves him . <p> She 's twelve . <p> We were in the kitchen when she delivered the news , last Monday , a school morning . I was at the sink , looking out the window . It was n't quite light out yet . The sky was the color of slate . The darkness was fading out of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds ticking down toward zero while Katrina 's instant oatmeal cooked inside it . Katrina was sitting on a stool at the counter fiddling with a spoon . <p> She said , " Dad ? " <p> I said " Yes , " sharply , still grumpy with sleep , still looking out the window . There are deep woods behind our house , and I was watching the way the trees seemed to be slowly gathering shape as the sky grew lighter . Katrina put her spoon down . She said , " Is it okay if I go to the movies Saturday night with Jamie , and then to a party at Linda 's after ? " <p> My first response was to the mention of Linda 's name . She is this friend of Katrina 's that I ca n't stand . Linda has been giving me heartburn since she and Katrina became friends , back in third grade . Why Katrina likes her is beyond me . She 's a foulmouthed , aggressive , arrogant , antisocial little miscreant . The kid hates everybody and everything  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loathes and despises teachers . She thinks her classmates are all idiots . The girl is a storm cloud on legs . <p> I said , " Linda 's ? " My tone of voice making my feelings apparent . <p> " Well , it 's at her house . I think her parents will be there . " <p> " You think ? " <p> She said , " You know Linda . " <p> " Absolutely , " I said . I knew Linda . I had a bet going with Jeff , a guy I do some work for , that she would n't make it to fifteen without getting pregnant . I knew for certain , having eavesdropped on a couple of birthday-party sleepovers over the years , that there was n't a sex act on record that she did n't have at least six ways of describing . From age nine , as far as I could tell , the only things Linda had any interest in were sex and loud music . <p> " What 's that mean ? " Katrina said . " AbsoluteIy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms crossed over my chest . " It means I do n't like Linda . " Behind me the microwave began a series of four loud chirps , its annoying way of announcing that the oatmeal was done . <p> Katrina whispered , " Microbird . " <p> We call the microwave Microbird because Katrina , once , in first grade , made eyes and a beak out of yellow construction paper and taped them to the machine 's side . We left them on because Alex used to run into the room whenever Microbird chirped . <p> I said , " I heard it , Katrina . Did you think I did n't hear it ? " <p> The way she was sitting behind the white counter , with both hands wrapped around a black coffee mug full of juice , she looked almost grown up , a young woman on her way to a lousy job or a boring morning class at college . The green of her eyes seemed especially bright , and at first I thought it was just the green blouse she was wearing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you wearing eyeliner ? " I asked , even though I could see it plainly . <p> " Just real light , " she said . " Just a little bit . " <p> " Do n't I get asked about these things anymore ? " I could hear my voice getting louder . I could hear the anger in my voice . I turned around to get the oatmeal . <p> Katrina dropped her voice down so that it was barely audible , the way she always does when she sees that I 'm angry . She said , " I 'm asking your permission about Saturday . " <p> " That 's good of you , " I said , not looking at her , looking at my own reflection in the black glass of the micro . I noticed the way my gut was pushing at the fabric of my robe . I noticed the gray in my unkempt hair , the loose and unhealthy texture of my skin . Katrina 's skin was so smooth and bright it seemed to vibrate . " Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " that I 'd be picking up Jamie and driving you to the theater , and then picking you up after and driving you to the party , and then picking you up from the party and driving you both home , it 's good of you to ask my permission . " <p> Katrina spoke so softly I had to lean toward her to hear . She stumbled over some words , which she 's been doing a lot lately . " Jamie 's brother 'll ta-take us . He 's in college . We 're going to go to the movies with him and his girl-girlfriend . They 'll take us to the party . You only have to take us home . " <p> I took the oatmeal out . It was in a glass bowl , and the bowl was hot , as always . I snapped it down on the counter in front of Katrina . " You 've got this all planned , I see . " <p> Katrina 's eyes were getting watery . She 's always been like she could read my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's bad enough Jamie 's fourteen , but you 're not going to the movies with college-age kids . Period ! " <p> " It 's his brother , " she said . She was crying then . She pushed the oatmeal aside and started for her room , but she stopped at the stairs to look back at me . " I love Jamie , " she said . " We 're going steady now . And Linda 's my best friend ! " She wiped her eyes with her arm , defiantly , and continued up the stairs . <p> When I heard her door close , I threw her bowl of oatmeal at the wall . It shattered , seeding the rug with glass . Ugly brown gobs of cereal dripped down the wall . I took my car keys from their hook above the sink and drove away , leaving Katrina to catch the bus and go to school without so much as a good-bye . <p> That was Monday , and Katrina and I just stopped talking to each other . I usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that gets me out of bed  --  but I 've been sleeping through her breakfasts all week . I 've been sleeping through most of the day all week . I have n't had any work for months . I 'm in graphic design , and computers are putting me out of business . That 's something else I 'm going to have to deal with . Right now , though , it 's Katrina that 's the problem . Me and Katrina . The other night when I was out on the deck , the moon was bright and fat and full . It looked like a hole in the sky , a pale tunnel . This was Wednesday or Thursday . The way Katrina looked lying in her bed , on her back like that , like she was flying , I thought of how young she was and all the things there were in the world that were still mysteries to her . It made me want to steal into her room and kneel next to her bed and touch my cheek to her cheek , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we were n't talking , and I had n't done that in ages  --  and anyway she was getting too old for me to be creeping into her room in the middle of the night and hovering over her bed . And her door was locked . I could see through the window that the button on the inside knob was pushed in . <p> There 's a flight of stairs that leads down from the deck to our yard , which is really very small but looks big because our property backs up against a few miles of woods . I do n't go down to the yard much . There 's nothing there but broken branches that need picking up and a few azalea bushes clumped together where I once had the idea to make a garden plot something like ten or eleven years ago . But I went down to the yard that night . I do n't know why . It 's three o'clock in the morning and I 'm standing in the middle of my yard in my pajamas in the moonlight . The moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lean my head back and howl . I had a strong urge to howl  --  but I did n't , afraid to wake up Katrina . Instead , I unbuttoned my pajama top and took it off . Then I slid out of the bottoms and my underwear . I was thinking to myself : you 're a short fat guy naked in your yard in moonlight . I walked around a bit , stepping gingerly over twigs and rocks . I stood at the point where my yard ended and the woods began , and I stayed still and looked hard , hoping I might see something , a deer or a raccoon , which there are plenty of in those woods , but I did n't see anything . Nothing moving . Just the moonlight on the bark of the trees and the still shadows of leaves and branches . <p> I ca n't say why I took off my clothes except it felt good to be undressed and exposed to the night air . <p> I leaned against a tree and pissed on a clump of leaves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight dark line . <p> I rested my forehead on the rough bark of the tree I was leaning against , and I closed my eyes and tried to feel the night air and the moonlight . I stayed there a long time like that , until I guess I got bored . Until whatever it was that got into me got out of me and I went back to where my pajamas were lying on the ground . I picked them up and shook them out , and while I was shaking them out I saw , under the scraggly azaleas , a couple of small ceramic elves and a piece of petrified wood the size of a man 's fist . I had bought the elves at a local nursery , as decoration , when I was planning the garden . Actually Michelle bought them , my then-wife , Katrina 's mother . She bought the elves , and I pulled the petrified wood up out of the basement . I had been carrying that chunk of rock around with me all my life , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Michelle thought I was kidding . She asked , " Why would you want to put that out here ? " <p> I did n't know why . Things at that time in our life were going especially well . Katrina was less than a year old ; and having her , which we had n't planned on , had changed things between us . We had been married a couple of years at that point , and for a long time the marriage had been rough . We did n't know if we loved each other . We did n't know if we even liked each other . We fought a lot  --  about housework , about who should do what , about who was spending whose money . But things settled down after Katrina . We seemed to settle into the idea of the three of us , the pattern of it . Katrina did something to both of us . She filled us up . She turned us into adults . <p> I did n't know why I had pulled the petrified wood up out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . I had been dragging it around all my life in a box full of junk , always stashing it someplace . Then all of a sudden I went looking for it , hauling it up into the garden , where I thought it would make a good decorative piece . <p> What Michelle knew about the petrified wood was that my father damn near killed me with it . My father was one of the most bitter and frustrated men who ever walked God 's Earth . It was n't that he was bad or mean , not essentially , it was just that he was full of frustration and anger . It shone out of him like a black light . There were five kids in my family , plus my mother , and we were all afraid of him . My father never reached his hand toward me that I did n't flinch . I ca n't ever recall a kind word from him . It had to do with not having enough money , with not getting enough respect . He was angry . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a trip from Los Angeles to Brooklyn . My father was born in Brooklyn and lived all his life there , except for the one trip to the West Coast . He was in his thirties then and out of work for the umpteenth time . He went to Los Angeles to take a job working for a guy he had met in the Army , and the job went great for about two years before he decided he was n't getting paid well enough or promoted fast enough . He wound up punching out the guy who had originally hired him . Then he packed up his wife and his five kids and a few possessions , all in the beat-up old Dodge , and started back across the country to Brooklyn . It was n't a pleasant journey . We made the trip in a little over seventy hours , with my father driving night and day . He had a bad back , and it started acting up early . Before we made it out of California , he was driving in pain . His back hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight in the driver 's seat . I can remember my more tying him into the seat with thick yellow rope , to keep him upright , to keep him from slumping over against the wheel . That 's the way he drove across the whole country , roped into the front seat . <p> We ate in the car and we slept in the car . We stopped only for food and for gas and for bathrooms  --  and the one stop I pleaded for , the one in Arizona . I wanted to see the Petrified Forest . I was ten years old , and something about the words petrified forest set my imagination going . I do n't know what I thought it would be like , I do n't know what I thought I 'd see , but I risked my father 's wrath and pressed him to stop . <p> " We could just stop for a few minutes , Dad , " I said . " Just so we could see what it looks like , the petrified forest . " <p> He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , to everyone 's surprise , when we got to the Petrified Forest National Park , he took us in . I remember this huge petrified log lying like a bridge over a ravine that must have gone down a hundred feet , maybe more . Other than that there was n't much . I do n't know what I had expected : a big forest with rock trees or something , but there was just a lot of rock-strewn ground , and a lot of the rocks were really petrified wood . I picked up a piece , and my mother told me to put it down . You could n't take any petrified wood out of the park . It was illegal . <p> I took a piece anyway . I smuggled it into the car when no one was looking and put it under the front seat . We stayed at the park twenty minutes at the most , just long enough to use the rest rooms and look around a little bit before my father herded us all back into the car and back on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep awhile , he found the rock . Actually , my mother found it . It was pressing up into the bottom of her seat , and she felt it when she was trying to go to sleep . She reached around and pulled it out . She said , " What 's this ? " and then I could see by the look on her face , once my dad looked over at her , that she wished she had n't said anything . He took it from her . She had been holding it with both hands , and I remember that when he took it from her I noticed how his hand was so much bigger than hers , how he was able to hold it in one hand with his fingers grasping its stony edges . " It 's petrified wood , " he said , and he looked right at me . He was n't tied into the seat then : my mother had untied him so that he could sleep more comfortably . He leaned into the backseat and held the chunk of petrified wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its headlights swept over the wood , lighting up the deep purple and yellow and rust-red quartz . " Did n't you read the sign ? " he said . " Did n't your mother tell you ? " He was leaning over me then , and I was wishing that he was still tied up ; and I was looking at the muscles of his right arm , the arm that was holding the rock . His arm looked huge . I said , " I did n't take it , " and then this look that was a mixture of disgust and disdain came over his face . Disgust and disdain mixed with surprise . <p> Of course I took it . He knew I took it . Everyone knew I took it . He looked at me for just a second longer , and then he hit me with the petrified wood . It was n't an especially hard blow . I 'm sure he did n't mean to hurt me as badly as he did , but the quartz edges of the petrified wood were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my head and I blacked out instantly . Later , when I got older and thought back on it , I realized that he had knocked me out and given me a concussion . When I opened my eyes again , I was in the front seat , in my mother 's arms , and she was holding a blood-soaked towel against the side of my head , pressing hard . My father was roped into his seat again , driving fast . I saw the speedometer hit ninety and ninety-five . I threw up a half-dozen times that night , and every time we had to stop my father got furious and cursed me and my mother . I can still remember that night vividly , how sick I was , speeding through the desert in my mother 's arms , my father roped into the seat like a restrained animal . We drove all night , and in the morning the sun rose bright red . <p> And there it was again , in my backyard , that same piece of petrified wood . I put my pajamas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother and father were both long dead . I hardly ever saw my brothers and sisters anymore , not since I stopped going to family gatherings because it was too hard without Michelle and Alex . I picked up the rock , and just holding it in my hands made me remember him . It was as if I could see him standing in front of me , his face dark with the anger that was always right there , just under his skin . <p> I 've wanted all my life never to be like him . <p> I hurled the petrified wood toward the trees , meaning to throw it into the woods , but it did n't make it that far ; and then I went back into the house and went to bed and fell asleep quickly and slept through most of the day . <p> When Katrina came home from school , I told her she could go out with Jamie Saturday night . I told her she could go to the party and that I 'd pick her up after . She gave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could believe me . She said , " Thanks , " and that was it . She put her book bag in the closet and went up to her room . <p> Now it 's Saturday night , and I 'm out on the deck . Fully dressed . I 'm wondering whether I did the right thing , telling her she could go to the party . I 'm wondering what 's going on with me . I 'm still not sleeping at night . Nights I wander around the house or out on the deck  --  though I have n't paid any more naked visits to the woods . I can hear Katrina upstairs running water in the bathroom . It 's eight o'clock , and Jamie and his brother should be here by now . I 'm wishing that the kid were n't fourteen and that it was his father instead of his brother who was taking them to the movies . And I 'm wondering about Katrina , just what she 's doing with Jamie . I figure they 're kissing , but I wonder if maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything more , to want to do anything more ? How do I find out something like that ? What am I supposed to do about it ? I 'm thinking about this when I hear a loud car roaring down our block . Loud , like the muffler 's missing . I 'm praying it 's not Jamie and his brother , but then I hear the car stop in front of our house and the car doors slam , and I know it 's got to be them . <p> A minute later the front doorbell rings . I take a deep breath and hesitate a moment , wanting to put off for just a second or two the social act : the pleasant father receiving in a kindly manner his daughter 's date and her chaperon . Then , before I 've even turned around , I hear Katrina yell " Bye , Dad ! " and open the front door . I 'm in the house in a flash , but the door is already closed . By the time I pull it open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car and the back door is closing as Jamie gets in . An older boy I assume is Jamie 's brother is just opening the driver's-side door . <p> " Hey , " I yell . " Wait up a minute ! " I 'm furious now . My face is red and my fists are clenched  --  but I do n't want it to show . I do n't want to embarrass Katrina , even though she 's just embarrassed me , making me feel like some kind of jerk who would let his daughter go out without even meeting her date . I try a joking manner . " What 's up ? " I say . " Are you guys on your way to a fire ? " <p> The older boy offers me his hand . It 's early May , and the air is still damp from a recent rain . The lawn feels soggy under my shoes . I 'm standing on the lawn , the car is parked at the curb , the street is dark . It 's dark inside the car , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , even though the front door is partly open . I shake the boy 's hand . <p> " Mr. Hillman , " he says . " Hello . " He 's being polite . He looks like your typical , all-American college student : tall , well-built , baby-faced handsome . He 's wearing a white denim jacket over a black T-shirt , and he looks like he might be high on something , maybe pot . His eyes are red , and he has the manner of someone being careful to appear sober . <p> " Did you lose your muffler ? " I ask , smiling broadly . I have to look up to look him in the eyes . <p> He smiles back and does n't reply . He looks a little nervous . <p> I step around him and lean down to look into the backseat . I ca n't see much because the car is so dark , but I see the shape that is Katrina . She leans against Jamie , her arm linked inside his , and the sight of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protector , like I 'm the bad guy , makes me want to reach in there and grab the kid by the throat and shake him till he cries like the baby he is . Katrina says , " Hi , Dad , " and the other shapes in the car  --  Jamie and an older girl in the front seat  --  say " Hi , Mr. Hillman " simultaneously . <p> Such a polite group . They make it so obvious I 'm the enemy , the unsympathetic unhip outsider carrying a list of rules and regulations . The father . <p> " Gee , " I say , " I ca n't see anybody , " and I reach into the car and turn on the interior light . Katrina smiles at me , an intensely nervous smile , but I hardly recognize her . She 's wearing a black leather miniskirt that I did n't know she owned . It comes down only to mid-thigh . I notice the miniskirt first , and then I see that she 's wearing nylon stockings that turn her little-girl 's legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know what to say . I 'm bent over awkwardly , looking into the backseat , smiling like an idiot , trying to think fast , to figure out what I should do . <p> Katrina does n't even look like Katrina . I turn away from her for a moment , with a small awkward laugh . She 's wearing makeup that 's been applied much too heavily : the rouge on her cheeks is too bright . She looks like a clown . The black lines around her eyes are a quarter-inch wide . She 's even done something to the shape of her eyebrows . She looks like a child who has gotten hold of her mother 's makeup  --  which is exactly what she is . All these years she 's kept her mother 's makeup in her bottom dresser drawer along with her jewelry . When I look back at her I see that she 's wearing a pair of earrings I bought for Michelle on our first anniversary . They 're jade , expensive . <p> " Kat , " I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to you about something before you left . Can you come back in the house for a moment ? " <p> Katrina begins to protest . Something about the movie schedule , but I 'm not listening . I turn around and walk back to the house . It occurs to me that they could just ignore me and drive off , and I know for sure if I hear that car start I 'll be in mine in a second and I 'll chase them down . <p> But the car does n't start . I go back in the house and cross my arms over my chest and wait in the hallway . A moment later Katrina comes through the door . She 's crying . Her mascara is running . <p> " Do n't ru-ruin my night , " she says . Her voice is defensive . She knows she 's wrong . It 's in her voice . She 's praying I 'll let her go . She 's praying I wo n't humiliate her . That 's in her voice too . <p> What am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed to let her go out like that ? She looks up at me , and even with all the makeup I can see her child 's eyes . " Kat , " I say . " You 're twelve years old . " <p> " I 'll be thirteen next week , " she says . And now the tears are flowing . Black circles are forming under her eyes . <p> I look down and cover my forehead with my hand as if I 'm checking for a fever . " Kat , " I say , without looking up . " Just take the makeup off and get changed . Just wash off the makeup and get changed , quick , and then I 'll let you go out . " <p> " I 'm not getting changed ! " she yells . " You a-a-always do thi-this ! You make me so miserable ! " <p> " I make you miserable ? " I shoot back , my voice loud suddenly . " Is that what you said ? " <p> " Ye-Ye-Yes ! " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stamping one foot for emphasis , like a caricature of an angry woman . " You hate me , " she goes on , shouting , her words fluid now . " You wish I were dead too ! " <p> I lean toward her , wanting to shout something at her , something I ca n't even remember once her final words register . The words hit like a punch , like getting hit in the stomach . <p> Katrina grabs the doorknob and starts to leave . <p> I lean my weight into the door , slamming it closed . " How could you say that ? " I ask . " How could you say something like that ? " <p> " Because it 's true , " she says . She 's talking on some other level now , in some new place . " You never say anything nice to me . You 're always angry at me for something . You wish I were n't here . You hate me . You 're always trying to embarrass me . " <p> I look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of me . The softness of her face is disappearing . She 's growing denser , harder . Her beauty is disappearing . She 's ugly in her face paint and her whore 's costume . Her green eyes turn black . " Do you believe that ? " I ask . <p> She does n't respond right away . She looks up at me , and I can tell she 's waiting for me to tell her it 's not true . She 's forgotten about her date . She 's forgotten about the car waiting for her outside . She 's waiting for me . She 's waiting for me to tell her what she needs to hear . <p> " Go on , " I say . My voice is like a stone speaking . " Go out on your date . " <p> Katrina does n't move . <p> I open the door for her . <p> She looks at me for another second , then runs out . <p> I watch her hurry into the car and I watch the car drive away . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning off all the lights . Then I sit in the dark for a long time . My head is empty . There 's not a thought in it . After a while I get up and go out on the deck and down into the yard . I move slowly toward the trees . One by one , Katrina 's words replay . Katrina 's words and my responses . At my feet I see the petrified wood , and I pick it up . Katrina 's words and my words are re-playing in my mind . What she said . How I responded . I 'm standing at the tree line looking into the woods , not seeing a thing . I press the flat and smooth part of the petrified wood against my chest over my heart like a stethoscope . It 's cool and soothing . I 'm tight all over , in my neck and my back and my face , my face especially .
