<p> Early one morning last month , an 81-year-old white man was attacked in his garage by three black intruders who tied his hands and feet , stuffed matches and a cloth in his mouth and strangled him with his own tie . Then they entered the house and repeatedly raped his 74-year-old wife . <p> The crime in the nearby town of Germiston was one of a series that has shocked South Africans in recent months . But what most stunned many whites was that one of the suspects had worked for the victims at their take-out cafe and as a gardener at their house . This was not just murder and rape , but a betrayal of the long-standing social order . <p> After more than 40 years in the iron grip of the apartheid system of racial domination , South Africa is breaking loose  --  and breaking apart . Apartheid not only enshrined white privilege , it also dictated relationships between whites and blacks and between blacks and other blacks . It determined where people lived , what jobs they had , where they went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park bench people could sit on . <p> Now the old rules are going , but new ones have not yet taken their place . It is both an exhilarating moment of opportunity  --  and a frightening , chaotic , even murderous interregnum . <p> Among leaders , despite frequent flashes of angry rhetoric , a sense of reconciliation and shared destiny is palpable . At a recent preliminary round of all-party talks , the Yuppie-ish new defense minister , Roelf Mayer , was photographed chatting amiably with an avowed communist who 10 years ago masterminded a car bomb attack on air force headquarters . <p> But the conviviality of elites does not extend to followers . Now , white skin is not just a privilege but also a target . Beset by a soaring crime rate and an uncertain future , whites fear for their homes , their money and their children . <p> Contractors are doing a huge business in security walls , alarm systems , guard dogs and firearms . The old collective mental laager  --  the traditional defensive ring of covered wagons that once surrounded white settlements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the barbarians at the gates . <p> " The most frightening thing of all is that the white sees himself targeted as white , so he 's starting to identify himself as white , " said Tony Leon , a liberal white member of Parliament from the northern suburbs of Johannesburg . " There is n't a right-wing backlash but a white backlash . " <p> Blacks are equally mistrustful . Most still do not believe that the white government , with its recalcitrant , predominantly Afrikaner bureaucracy and its elaborate state security apparatus , intends to hand over or share power . Many contend shadowy groups of whites connected to the government are behind the outbreak of black township violence . And although the race laws themselves are gone , apartheid 's legacy  --  squalid ghetto housing , separate and unequal schools , rampant unemployment and personal humiliation  --  remains the central enduring fact of black life . <p> " White people have been oppressing us for so long . I think now they are afraid we will do the same thing to them that they did to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political activist in Evaton , a sprawling black township south of Johannesburg . <p> For many blacks , routine acts of daily life such as commuting to work have become fraught with danger . Police , once true believers and loyal enforcers of the old order , seem laconic and demoralized . There is a sense of desperation , even panic as townships implode . <p> " People fear if there 's no political resolution in 18 months , this place is over , " said Lloyd Vogelman , a psychologist who directs the Project for the Study of Violence at the University of Witswatersrand . " We 're so far into the cycle now , we 'll be in a no-comeback zone . Lebanon 's a good example . " <p> This series of reports began Sunday with Northern Ireland , which for more than two decades has been frozen in a protracted ethnic and religious conflict that seems immune to the vast political changes sweeping the world . Today , it looks at the other extreme , in South Africa , where the world 's most entrenched system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's demise raises thorny questions : Can a society recover from the terrible damage  --  political , economic and human  --  wrought by ethnic conflict and systematic social suppression ? Or are the wounds so deep that even the advent of multiracial democracy can not heal them ? Purveyors of Panic and Fear <p> Every evening when they boarded the train home to Soweto after a 10-hour workday in central Johannesburg , Anna Maleka and her fellow passengers would offer a thanksgiving prayer  --  for their jobs , for their families and for surviving another day in the white man 's city . Then one night a year ago , their prayers were shattered by the rapid-fire rattle of gunfire . " I looked at my arm , " she recalled . " I did n't feel anything , but it was bleeding . " <p> A well-dressed young black man stormed through the passenger car with a shotgun . " Where are the men ? Where are the men ? " he yelled as he strode forward , firing and reloading and firing again . <p> Maleka , a 42-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what has been a year-long , blood-stained series of train massacres . There have been more than 40 attacks by heavily armed black gangs , and more than 60 people have been killed . Sometimes the motive is robbery , but more often it is just murder . <p> The attacks are indiscriminate . They seem designed to sow panic and fear rather than eliminate any specific target . Few suspects are caught by police , and those who are often seem to find ways to avoid trial . When passengers captured one armed attacker in October and turned him over to police , they were stunned to find him free a few days later on bail of less than $ 800 . <p> The handful of attackers who have been arrested appear to have connections with Zulu chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi 's Inkatha Freedom Party . It has had mixed success in establishing itself as a political force in the townships around Johannesburg , but the open warfare between its followers and those of Nelson Mandela 's African National Congress has contributed to the climate of fear . <p> Economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa is mired in its longest recession since World War II . Experts say it would take a 5 percent real annual growth rate to provide jobs for the hundreds of thousands of blacks who leave school each year . Instead , the growth rate is zero or less . Nearly 40 percent of the total labor force is unemployed , and the work force is absorbing less than 10 of every 100 students who drop out of school . <p> During the heady , chaotic days of black rebellion , about million youngsters got little or no education . An estimated 1.2 million have never been to school at all . Now many of the former " comrades " are coming of age into a society that offers no jobs and no hope . One result is a new generation of gangs like Soweto 's " Zebra Force , " whose leaders have boasted that they plan to rape every woman in the township under 26 . <p> They can be seen on the dusty streets of Soweto  --  angry young men in Nelson Mandela T-shirts . They move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities with the same passion their predecessors used to expend on battling white soldiers and police . People are afraid to go outside after dark , said Mandla Tembo , a Soweto journalist who recently bought a gun that he keeps under his bed at night . <p> " The rewards the youth thought they would get from political change are not really available to them , " said Khela Shubane , a former activist and social science researcher . " For those without skills , life seems pretty much what it was before , in fact worse . We are told that what white people enjoyed for all these years is not possible for us . " <p> During the days of the draconian state of emergency under former president Pieter W. Botha , most blacks viewed the white-led security forces as an alien army of occupation . But the wave of township violence has caused many to revise that view . In the townships outside Cape Town , residents recently embarrassed Mandela 's African National Congress , the predominant black liberation movement , by demanding a return of troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxi operators . <p> Anna Maleka said she believes in Mandela and the ANC and will vote for the ANC when an election is held . But like a lot of older township residents , she finds herself missing the security of the old order . <p> " My position is , this violence must stop , " she said . " Whether it 's a white government or a black government , I do n't care , as long as they can stop this . I can not walk out at night . I am frightened all the time . " <p> Policemen like Capt . J.C . du Plessis are supposed to stop the killing . A thin , mustachioed Afrikaner in his mid-thirties , du Plessis is in charge of the 300 or so policemen who patrol the commuter trains that haul half a million black workers from Soweto to central Johannesburg each morning . It is , he readily concedes , a losing battle . <p> The captain is a good-natured , laconic and fatalistic veteran officer who spends his days in an office at the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , three white subordinates lounge on benches in his office , drinking coffee and listening to pop songs on the radio . When the captain ventures outside to show a visitor around the station , the trio springs to life , providing an armed escort that shadows the captain wherever he goes . <p> About 120 trains pass through New Canada during a three-hour rush period each morning . The railway cars are pockmarked with rust . Many of the doors have been pried off their hinges by thieves who sell them for scrap . Police attempt to check passengers for weapons as they enter stations , but the tracks themselves are open and easily accessible , and armed intruders can board a slow-moving train anywhere along the line . <p> " You would need 3,000 policemen to secure all these trains . That 's the number we have for all of Soweto , " said du Plessis . <p> Like policemen everywhere , he complained that the courts are too lenient and judges too inclined to return criminals to the streets . Still , the captain insisted that he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical about the result . " Nothing happens that has n't happened before , " he said with a smile . " The main thing is to remain unstressed . " <p> Du Plessis 's attitude seems to permeate the entire government , complained lawmaker Leon , whose predominantly white and affluent parliamentary district is beset by a soaring crime rate . <p> " The government does n't seem to be governing . On crime , education , economy , they are just letting things drift , " he said . " Ten years ago , there seemed to be a police van at every corner picking up blacks . They were brilliant at enforcing apartheid . Now they complain their hands are tied . " <p> Psychologist Vogelman said white fears are not irrational . He cited police statistics showing violent crime increased 49 percent in South Africa in 1990 . For 1991 , police anticipate a smaller but nonetheless significant increase . Killings of whites , while still relatively low , climbed 48 percent in 1990 , while killings of blacks rose 28 percent . <p> The transition period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Vogelman . With political power limited and wealth out of reach , violence becomes the only means of gratification and esteem for some young blacks . <p> " Violence enhances the sense of power for powerless people , " said Vogelman . " It 's exciting . It 's adrenaline . You 're alive . And each time you need more . First you get a thrill from slapping someone around . Then that 's not enough so you rape and beat and stab . Then it 's not sufficient to stab once , so you stab 50 times . " <p> Some whites are affected as well . In several incidents this past year , packs of whites have preyed on lone blacks . At the highly respected Dale College in King William 's Town , where four white students beat to death a 70-year-old black derelict , stunned authorities discovered a " kaffir-bashing society . " Many blacks believe bands of white extremists in the army and police are fueling township violence using the old apartheid principle of divide and conquer . <p> Parliament member Leon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Johannesburg restaurant last year , has a sheaf of letters from white victims of crime . The most desperate is from a woman named Diane who owns a small takeout cafe in a northern suburb . Six months ago , she wrote , she was attacked by four armed blacks . Now she cringes whenever black men enter the shop . <p> " The attack has had a devastating effect on me , " she wrote . " I am afraid in the shop , I am afraid at home . When I arrive home with my children , the fear comes all over me . <p> " I am pregnant at the moment , definitely not a planned pregnancy . The thought of bringing new life into the new South Africa is frightening and terrible thoughts go through my mind . . . . Is there a future ? What is the solution ? Do we cut our losses and leave with nothing , or do I sit for another attack ? " A Time for Reassessment <p> Helen Zille is living with a different kind of fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working as a professional mediator in the black taxi wars on the sand flat townships outside Cape Town . It 's been an eye-opening and depressing experience , she said . <p> At times , Zille and other intermediaries work through the night to reach truces , which are breached almost immediately . Every announcement of a settlement seems a prelude to another outbreak of the fighting that has killed 30 people over the past year . One mediator has been killed , and several others , Zille included , threatened with death . <p> Now she is dealing with another threat as well . The modest house near the University of Cape Town where she lives with her husband and two young children has been broken into by thieves a half-dozen times in recent weeks . Zille and her husband , a university lecturer who , like her , has long been active in the anti-apartheid movement , are afraid to leave the house at night , even briefly . They have added a stronger front gate and a new alarm system and are pondering buying guard dogs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear the thieves may decide to leave no witnesses . <p> The combination of frustration at work and danger at home has left Helen Zille angry and anxious and talking about how nice it would be to live somewhere " normal , " like London or Boston . <p> " This is not the way we wanted to live , " she said . " It 's taught me how scarce resources are and how hard people will struggle for them . I 'm under no more illusions about how difficult this transition will be . It 's a terrifying time , even for those of us who have worked for this all our lives . " <p> White liberals like Zille , who see their dreams fading , in some ways are the most frustrated by the interregnum . Many wonder if there will be a place for them in the new South Africa . A white woman who does volunteer work for the Black Sash , a woman 's group that for years has aided victims of apartheid , said whites find themselves in increasing conflict with paid black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a black professional at a prominent trade union organization complained of the privileged status of the white leftists who work there . <p> " For years , they have claimed a special role because they are white , well-educated and made sacrifices to be part of the movement , " he said . " So now , when blacks like me come along , they really resent it . They see me as a threat to their control . And they 're right . " <p> Above all , many blacks say , this is a time for reassessment . Whites must look anew at their privileges , and blacks must reexamine their expectations . It will be a painful experience for both sides , but it holds at least the promise of reconciliation . <p> " It 's a fact that people here do n't trust whites , and I suppose whites do n't trust us either , " said Themba Goba , a young black activist in Evaton . " But we have agreed to go beyond the past . It 's the future we must decide on @ @ @
