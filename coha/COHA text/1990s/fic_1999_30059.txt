The Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera slid through the black of space , its only companion the silent gas giant world of Pesitiin far below . Admiral Pellaeon was standing at the forward viewport , gazing out at the dead planet , when Captain Ardiff arrived on the bridge . " Report from Major Harch , Admiral , " he said briskly . " All damage from that pirate attack has been repaired . Your ship is back to full fighting readiness . " " Thank you , Captain , " Pellaeon said , carefully hiding a smile . In the thirty hours since the failed attack on the Chimaera , Ardiff had gone from believing it to be a raid by New Republic General Garm Bel Iblis , to suspicions that it had been engineered by dissident Imperial elements , to similar suspicions involving similarly dissident Rebels , and was now apparently convinced that a pirate gang was responsible . Of course , in all fairness , Ardiff had had the past thirty hours to cogitate on his theories . The techs ' preliminary report on the debris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . " Anything new from the patrols ? " Pellaeon asked . " Just more negatives , sir , " Ardiff said . " Still no indications of activity anywhere in the system . Oh , and the sensor-stealthed assault shuttle you sent on the attackers ' escape vector also just checked in . Still no trace . " Pellaeon nodded . As expected , really  --  anyone who could afford to buy and fly a battlecruiser usually knew a few tricks about hiding it . " It was worth a try , " he told Ardiff . " Have them try one more system ; we can transmit that far without relays . If they have n't picked up the trail by then , order them back . " " Yes , sir , " Ardiff murmured . Even without looking , Pellaeon could sense Ardiff 's hesitation . " A question , Captain ? " he prompted . " It 's this communications blackout , sir , " Ardiff said . " I do n't like being so completely out of contact this way . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me nervous . " " I do n't much like it myself , " Pellaeon conceded . " But the only ways to make contact with the outside universe are to either transmit to an Imperial relay station or punch our way onto the HoloNet ; and the minute we do either , everyone from Coruscant to Bastion will know we 're here . If that happens , we 'll have more than the occasional pirate gang lining up to take potshots at us . " And , he added silently , it would be the end of any chance for a quiet meeting between him and Bel Iblis . Assuming the general was indeed willing to talk . " I understand all that , Admiral , " Ardiff said . " But has it occurred to you that yesterday 's attack might not have been an isolated incident against an isolated Imperial ship ? " Pellaeon cocked an eyebrow . " Are you suggesting it might have been part of a coordinated attack against the Empire ? " " Why not ? " Ardiff said . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the New Republic who hired them . But why could n't the pirates have set it up on their own ? The Empire has always come down hard on pirate gangs . Maybe a group of them got together and decided the time was right for revenge . " Pellaeon stroked his lip thoughtfully . On the surface , it was a ridiculous suggestion  --  even on its deathbed the Empire was far stronger than any possible aggregate of pirate gangs could hope to defeat . But that did n't mean they would n't be foolish enough to try . " That still leaves the question of how they knew we were here , " he pointed out . " We still do n't know what happened to Colonel Vermel , " Ardiff reminded him . " Maybe it was this pirate coalition who snatched him . He could have told them about Pesitiin . " " Not willingly , " Pellaeon said darkly . " If they did what it would take to make him talk , I 'll decorate Bastion 's moon with their hides . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brings us back to the question of how long we 're going to stay here . " Pellaeon looked out the viewport at the stars . Yes , that was indeed the question . How long should they wait here in the middle of nowhere in the hope that this slow attrition of the Empire could be stopped ? That they could end this war with the New Republic with a shred of territory and dignity still intact ? That they could finally have peace ? " Two weeks , " he said . " We 'll give Bel Iblis another two weeks to respond to our offer . " " Even though the message may not have reached him ? " " The message reached him , " Pellaeon said firmly . " Vermel is a highly resourceful , highly competent officer . Whatever happened to him , I have no doubt he completed his mission first . " " Yes , sir , " Ardiff said , his tone making it clear that he did n't share Pellaeon 's confidence . " And if Bel Iblis does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " We 'll decide then . " Ardiff hesitated , then took half a step closer to his superior . " You really believe this is our best hope , sir , do n't you , " he said quietly . Pellaeon shook his head . " No , Captain , " he murmured . " I believe it 's our only hope . "
