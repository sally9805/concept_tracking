Even Midtown , a long forgotten and once rundown zone south of downtown , has more than 1,000 new apartment units in the construction pipeline . <p> " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Timm Wooten , executive vice president of Martin J.

Its 384-unit Gramercy Park opened in December and was leased up by May - the fastest " lease-up " of a new project in the company 's history , he said . <p> " It 's hard to find an empty apartment , " said Sherry Moore of Apartment Finders , which helps tenants find places to live . " The nice places lease up fast .

Most of the apartments he had been looking at rent for about $ 550 a month , but he had been considering leasing a converted attic in an old house for $ 405 . <p> " I am kind of dealing with the fact that I 'm going to spend a lot more than I wanted to , " Leatherwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the average Houston apartment rented for $ 514 , up 6.3 percent from a year earlier , Apartment Data Services said . However , O'Connor &; Associates placed the city 's rent increases at only 4.3 percent over the last year . <p> The rate hikes do n't match up to the late 1980s and early 1990s . Then , many Houston apartment dwellers were smacked with double-digit annual increases in rent . In 1992 , rents went into a flat period where increases were about 2 or 3 percent annually , until last year when they began rising faster again . <p> Keith Nappier , a 31-year-old data administrator , said he had been rethinking his plans to move to a larger apartment after seeing that two-bedroom units were $ 700 to $ 900 per month in the area he desires .

The newly built projects are aimed at the more affluent renters and a glut of upper end apartments could develop , he said . <p> " I would say we are in the process of becoming overbuilt in the upscale market , " Smith said . <p> Houston is seeing a large increase over the 4,000 new apartment units that were opened in 1997 . <p> In addition to the heavy construction , another bump in the road for the apartment market in 1998 will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding approximately 90,000 jobs in 1997 , Houston 's job growth could be half that amount in 1998 , Smith said .

But the economy and the apartment market may not continue to perform at outstanding levels . <p> Kim Ward , regional manager for Equity Residential Properties , notes , however , that Houston landlords have been leasing the newly built apartments with ease . <p> With the apartment market humming at such a high speed , it 's difficult for some to utter many negative words about the Houston apartment market today . <p> " The apartment market is better now than it 's been since 1982 .
