<p> Carl Lewis makes his track farewell Saturday at halftime of a University of Houston football game . He 'll run an exhibition 4x100-meter relay with three training partners ; he 'll have a uniform retired . <p> There 's a symbolic irony in the event to be held at Robertson Stadium in his adopted hometown on a track that Lewis donated to his alma mater . The only way to guarantee the most decorated track star in history a large crowd is to hold the ceremony in conjunction with a football game . <p> Lewis got what he wanted from his career , aside from medals . As he once said , " I want to be a millionaire , and I do n't ever want a real job . " <p> But critics say that Lewis did little to popularize the sport in the USA , that he cared more about personal gains than the growth of the sport . <p> Yet there is no doubt about his athletic accomplishments . He was great , he was durable , he was dramatic . <p> So Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , flashing his signature style  --  perfect knee lift balanced by open palms knifing through the air . He 'll head into track history as well as careers as a fashion entrepreneur , charity fund-raiser , pitchman for fitness products and actor who would n't mind doing physical comedy . <p> Before he starts infomercials or pratfalls , it 's worth a look at some of the milestone events in his career . <p>  --  1984 Olympics : The Los Angeles Games made Lewis a global name as he duplicated Jesse Owens ' 1936 feat of winning gold medals in the 100 , 200 , long jump and 4x100 relay . <p> Yet Lewis did n't captivate the public . He blamed an unflattering piece in Sports Illustrated for making him look greedy and arrogant . He also was criticized unjustly for jumping just twice in six rounds of the long jump to minimize injury and conserve energy for the 200 and relay . <p> The tone had been set . Lewis ' greatest accomplishments often would be accompanied by controversy . <p>  --  1991 World Champion- <p> ships : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just when it looked like he might be slipping from the top , he won the 100 and reclaimed the world record in what is widely considered the best sprint ever . <p> The admiration for his comeback created goodwill , which did n't last too long . In the long jump , Lewis managed the greatest series in history with three 29-footers . But his 65-meet win streak was ended by Mike Powell , who broke Bob Beamon 's 23-year-old mark ( 29-21/2 ) by 2 inches . <p> Lewis could have scored a public relations coup by congratulating Powell and/or honestly expressing his disappointment . Instead , he downplayed any frustration and was ungracious , implying Powell 's record was a fluke . <p> Lewis also anchored the U.S. 4x100 to a world record . <p>  --  1992 Olympics : Because of a viral infection , Lewis was n't a factor in the sprints at the U.S. Trials . But in Barcelona , Spain , he found enough energy to win the long jump . <p> He lobbied against Michael Johnson being included in the 4x400 relay even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , eligible . <p> In a news conference , Lewis misled the international media about U.S. selection criteria and criticized coach Mel Rosen in an unsuccessful effort to get Johnson displaced . <p> When the 4x100 relay ran into injury problems , Rosen <p> turned to Lewis , who produced another gold medal anchor leg . <p> " What I never understood , " Rosen says , " is why he tried to get involved in the 4x400 . " <p>  --  1996 Olympics : Lewis showed his flair for the dra- <p> matic . Failing to make the team in the sprints at the Trials , he got the third and final U.S. spot in the long jump . <p> In Atlanta , he was down to his final qualifying jump before cracking the top 12 and making the final . He went on to win a fourth title in the event . <p> Another relay controversy ensued . After the long jump , he campaigned to anchor the 4x100 . The trouble was he had never reported to a pre-Atlanta relay camp as required . Coach Erv Hunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't selected , and the USA was beaten by Canada . <p> The shame of Lewis ' career is that his ability and fame were n't exploited by the U.S. federation to promote the <p> sport . " You ca n't blame Carl for that , " says LeRoy Walker , ex-president of the federation and U.S. Olympic Committee . <p> Instead of cooperating , the U.S. federation and Lewis feuded . The man who packed stadiums in Europe could n't do it in the USA . <p> New USA Track &; Field CEO Craig Masback is considering naming Lewis a goodwill ambassador . That will need evaluation considering recent Lewis comments that include comparing the USA to East Germany with performance drug use . <p> But that 's King Carl . He produces controversy . But his greatest legacy will be the memorable performances he produced on the track . <p> Midas touch <p> Carl Lewis ' nine Olympic gold medals tie him with Finnish distance runner Paavo Nurmi and Soviet gymnast Larisa Latynina for the most ever .
