After more than five years of uninterrupted growth , analysts have taken to calling it the " Goldilocks economy "  --  an American expansion that is not too fast and not too slow but just right . Now , they are saying , Goldilocks may have gone global . And they can point to evidence everywhere : <P>  --  In Asia , battered Japan is back from the brink of disaster . After little growth in 1995 , it last year recorded 3% growth , the fastest among the big industrial economies . Meanwhile , China , its expansion having run amuck two years ago , has managed to pull off a " soft landing " by cutting back inflation without a recession . <P>  --  Only a year ago , Latin America was still reeling from the effects of the 1994 Mexican-peso collapse . Now virtually all its major economies are riding a wave of free-market bullishness . <P>  --  In Europe , growth is perking up despite high unemployment , and there 's renewed confidence that its plans to form a monetary union around the single-currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  With Wall Street leading most of the world 's stock markets outside Japan to record highs , the dollar vaulting higher , and foreign investment continuing to pour in , the U.S. is continuing to enjoy its second longest peacetime recovery . And there appears to be no end in sight . <P> So where 's the recession ? Traditional economic theory holds that every business upturn ends in a downward slide of sagging sales , declining profits and disappearing jobs . But when TIME brought together five internationally renowned experts during the World Economic Forum Meeting in Davos , Switzerland , an intriguing question floated through the clear Alpine air : Has the U.S. economy  --  the world 's largest and most influential  --  banished the business cycle ? Has the combination of high technology , globalized markets and unprecedented labor flexibility created a new paradigm of continual growth that can serve as a model for the rest of the planet ? <P> The answer from TIME 's experts was both yes and no . " The post-1982 American economy is significantly different from the pre-1982 one , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the bottom of the brutal 1982 recession , there have been but seven months of downturn . Previously , growth was interrupted on average every four years by long and deep recessions . Argued Hormats : " The business cycle has n't been repealed , but volatility has been greatly reduced . " <P> Does the swell of growth spreading around the world mean that the American model is contagious ? TIME 's experts would n't go that far . Although generally optimistic about the short term , most of the panel members also cautioned that the current good news could still contain the seeds of its own abrupt end . <P> " There 's more fragility in the system than is generally recognized , " warned Jeffrey Garten , dean of the Yale School of Management . " We are in a very precarious position because investors ' confidence is disconnected from any hard-hitting analysis of what is underlying the economy . Even a small increase in interest rates could puncture the balloon . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
