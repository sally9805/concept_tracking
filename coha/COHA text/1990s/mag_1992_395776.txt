A TEXAS PHILOSOPHER  --  IT may have been Dan Jenkins  --  once observed that " Barbed wire ai n't nothin ' but wire with barbed on it . " In other words , it 's real simple stuff , but as anyone who has tried to climb over a six-strand barbed-wire fence in heavy hunting pants can tell you , it can cause hellish complications . Thus it is with the rifle barrel , which ai n't nothin ' more than a steel tube with a hole drilled through it and spiral grooves cut down the length of the hole . And it can cause hellish complications . Accuracy in a rifle is produced by the combination of a good barrel , good bullets , and good stock bedding . Each factor counts for only a third , but if the barrel , bullet , or bedding is deficient , it will completely undo the other two elements . Although we know what constitutes a good barrel and what makes a bad one , we really do n't know why . Nor do we know why " bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes shoot poorly . All rifle barrels are made of either chrome-moly or stainless steel . Chrome-moly is the common abbreviation for chromium-molybdenum , two elements that are added to the steel to increase its resistance to wear at high temperatures . Chrome-moly steel is very tough stuff , and is used for most rifle receivers as well as barrels . Stainless steel has far more chromium and far less carbon than chrome-moly . The effect of this is to give it greater resistance to rust , but far more important , to lessen its tendency to erode under the heat of burning powder gases . A rifle barrel is worn out not by the friction of the bullet passing through it , but by melting when scorched repeatedly by the 5,000-degree flame that leaps from the cartridge case . The disadvantages to stainless steel are that it is more difficult to machine than chrome-moly ( it tends to " smear " when you cut it ) and , because it rusts hardly at all , it ca n't be blued satisfactorily . However , the best rifle barrels are today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure " steel , made to very high standards of quality . A stainless barrel , all other things being equal , will last considerably longer than a chrome-moly tube . But because it is so tough to work with , just about all stainless barrels are made by small shops that specialize in custom barrels , and they tend to be expensive . Barrels are made in six more or less standard contours , or tapers , and the contour decides the weight of the barrel . A number-one contour barrel goes on a light rifle while a number three barrel is better suited for a magnum cartridge where the gunsmith wants a bit more weight . Number five and number six barrels have very little taper from chamber to muzzle , and go on varmint or target guns . When barrels leave the barrelmaker , they are nothing more than rifled tubes of the desired contour . It is the gunsmith who chambers them , cuts them to length , crowns , polishes , and blues them . The two most important words in discussing a barrel are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either quality will render any barrel into a hissing and a by-word . The need for these two properties starts at the rear end of the barrel , or shank , which is threaded , and screws into the rifle 's receiver . However , unless the gunmaker is careful , the barrel may not be screwed in concentrically , in which case you have trouble . This is a fairly common fault , and the most obvious sign is that it 's difficult or impossible to align the scope with the bore . The scope , which is mounted on the receiver , may be looking off in a different direction than the barrel , and ne'er the twain shall meet . The other sign of a misaligned barrel is that the rifle wo n't shoot worth a damn . The chamber is the recess in the rear of the barrel that holds the cartridge during firing , and it must be drilled in perfect concentricity with the bore , or else the bullet will enter the barrel " cocked " to one side or another . Chamber dimensions are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sporting Arms and Ammunition Manufacturers ' Institute , but there is always some leeway in what actually gets drilled . Target shooters and benchresters love " tight " chambers that are cut to minimum dimensions and ensure a precise and consistent fit of each cartridge case . This approach works best with handloads , which are fireformed to fit the chamber exactly . For a hunting rifle , a minimum-dimension chamber is not a terrific idea , since such a rifle may have to digest a wide variety of ammunition , and not all factory ammo will fit readily . By the same token , a loose chamber will make precise alignment of the cartridge impossible , and accuracy will suffer . The best chamber for a game gun is straight SAAMI-spec . THE BORE OF THE BARREL  --  THE hole through it  --  must be perfectly aligned with the chamber and with the exact center of the barrel blank ( the undrilled barrel ) . It is quite a machining feat to drill a perfectly straight hole through a steel tube , and it is done by spinning the barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be not only straight , but a clean cut as well , devoid of chips , scrapes , dings , or toolmarks . After the barrel is drilled , the rifling is either cut or impressed into it . There are four ways in which this can be done . The oldest method is by " cutting " the rifling . Here , a narrow cutting tool on a rod is pulled through the barrel , taking a very thin slice of steel ( about .00005-inch ) with each pass . After each pass , the cutter indexes , or shifts , one-quarter , one-sixth , or one-eighth of a turn , depending on whether the barrel will have four , six , or eight rifling grooves , and takes another cut . This process is repeated until all the grooves are cut to the desired depth , which is usually around .004-inch . Although cut rifling is not much used anymore , a barrel produced carefully by this process is still a first-rate barrel . The key factor is who does the work , and how painstaking he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or cutters , and is faster than the first method , but it is rarely used in the production of rifle barrels . The third process is called button rifling , and employs a tungsten carbide " button , " or plug that is pulled through the barrel . The button does not cut the steel ; instead , it presses the rifling into the metal , and can , if carefully done , result in a beautifully finished bore . It is also much faster than cut rifling . Today , button rifling is the most popular method . Hammer forging is something like life , because the rifling is literally pounded into the barrel steel by multiple hammers striking with terrific force . In this process , a drilled barrel blank is inserted into the rifling machine , and a mandrel , or form , with a negative impression of the rifling , is inserted into the barrel blank . After a suitable amount of beating , a finished barrel emerges . Hammer-forging machines are large and expensive , and as a result , are used only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy about which process produces the best barrels , but the truth is that the type of machine used is far less important than the guy running it . The best barrelmakers are maniacal perfectionists who would probably make first-rate barrels with a hammer and chisel . Like people , barrels must be stress-relieved . A steel bar that has been subjected to the drilling and rifling process will be seething with built-in stresses , and as it heats up in firing , these stresses will be released , causing the barrel to warp slightly . The cure for this is heat-treating , where the barrel is heated , releasing all its hideous tensions , and allowed to cool . Some makers do this several times during manufacture . Theoretically , a good barrel should not " walk " or shift its point of impact as it heats up . But that is in theory . In real life , just about all hunting-weight barrels walk  --  some a little , some a lot  --  which is why you should never shoot a rifle hot when you 're zeroing it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target-weight tubes . Lapping is either what your dog does when it 's thirsty , or what a barrelmaker does as his final step in manufacture . It means , simply , polishing . You take a lead plug of bore diameter , coat it with a fine abrasive compound , screw it on the end of a stiff rod , and run it back and forth through the bore until you 're sick to death of the business . Lapping does two things : it imparts a high polish to the bore , and it ensures that the dimensions of the bore are perfectly even from chamber to muzzle with no loose or tight spots . How perfect ? For a barrel of hunting quality , no variation greater than .0005 for the length of the bore ; for a target barrel , no variation greater than .0002 . This measurement is taken with a device known as an air gauge , which can divide diameters down to .00005-inch . It utilizes a column of compressed air , which is forced through the bore , and measures the " leakage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inserted in the barrel . Some barrelmakers refuse to lap , claiming that a competent craftsman should be able to get a smooth and dimensionally perfect barrel right out of the machine , while the other school holds that polishing the bore is the only way to ensure that it is as close to perfect as possible . I tend to side with the latter . CROWNING , LIKE CHAMBERING , IS performed by the gunsmith who installs the barrel rather than by the barrelmaker , and must be done with extreme care . When a gunsmith cuts the barrel to its final length , the cut must be made at a perfect right angle to the axis of the bore , or else the bullet will emerge at an angle , and you will not be able to hit Cleveland with that particular barrel , never mind the target . " Crowning " refers to the practice of recessing. the center of the barrel after cutting it to length . This is done to protect the rifling . The quickest way to wreck a barrel is by putting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mars the rifling . If you want the gun to shoot again , you 'll have to have it recrowned . Virtually all barrelmakers , and many gunsmiths , use a borescope , which is a 6X magnifier and a tiny light on the end of a rod . The rod is inserted in the barrel , and reveals , in horrifying detail , any blemishes , warts , or imperfections that were missed in manufacture . So far , I 've made this sound like a highly precise business . Use good materials , the best machinery , do meticulous work , and you 'll produce a terrific barrel , right ? Wrong . The horrible truth is that there is a lot of voodoo in all this . There are rotten , sloppy barrels that shoot just great . There are beautiful , precise barrels , made with love and care , that will not shoot worth a damn . No one knows why . Nonetheless , here are some basic truths that may be useful . Nowadays , the average factory barrel is quite good , and will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them can be significantly improved by lapping and recrowning by a gunsmith who knows what he is doing . Any type of barrel work is wasted effort unless the other essentials of accuracy are met ; i.e. , the trigger is properly adjusted , the action is correctly bedded , etc . The gunsmith who installs the barrel is at least as important as the barrelmaker . A sloppy job of installation will undo the latter 's best efforts without fail . By and large , spending a lot of money on a custom barrel is not worth it unless you are a handloader and a serious shooter . Sticking a top-grade custom barrel on your rifle will not guarantee an increase in accuracy . You have to handload to find out what the barrel likes best , and you have to be able to shoot . A 2-minute-of-angle rifleman will not get 1/4-inch groups no matter what kind of barrel he has . If you are a competent rifleman and handloader , and your fancy barrel wo n't produce after a couple of trips to the range , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note saying where he can insert it . Some barrels are fussy , and will produce superior accuracy only with one load that is arrived at after weeks and weeks of heartache , expense , worry , frustration , weeping fits , disorientation , and vertigo . If it decides to cooperate with the first or the third or the fifth handload you feed it , rejoice , give thanks , and sing , you are way ahead of the game . Barrels are only human , and you have to find out , over time , what makes them happy . Two RANDOM NOTES : IN THE OCTOBER 1991 Shooting Department , I listed a number of small items to bring on a hunt that could bail you out of rifle-related trouble . Based on bitter personal experience , I would like to add a spare adjustment-turret cap to the list . After sighting in for a hunt in Montana , I neglected to tighten the windage cap fully , and after a day or two it dropped off , rendering the scope , the rifle , and myself null @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spare scope along . The cap was lost somewhere around Manhattan , Montana , and if anyone should happen to find it , there is a reward of $12.50 . Do n't bother to send fakes ; I 'd know this cap anywhere . A little while ago , a highly astute reader asked me why , in the December Shooting Department , I referred to the Steiner Penetrator scope , which weighs 21 ounces , as " very light , " and to the Schmidt &; Bender 4X-12X , which weighs 23 ounces , as " a lot of scope to carry around . " Let me make this perfectly clear , as a great statesman used to say . The Steiner is a very large scope , and for its massive and awesome size , it is quite light . The S &B; is a scope of more or less standard dimensions , and considering its size , it is quite heavy . Now leave me alone . <p>                    @
