When doctors experiment on their patients <p> AS THE NAZI DOCTORS KNEW WELL , there 's a seductive inverse relationship in human experiments : the less you protect the particular humans you study , the more you can learn about humans in general . Systematic near-freezing of Jews in concentration camps taught the German Luftwaffe a lot about staving off hypothermia , which was crucial for their pilots when they had to ditch in the North Sea . But the Nazis were n't the only ones to understand this perverse dichotomy . Fifty years ago the U.S. government allowed black men with syphilis in Alabama to go untreated as part of the notorious Tuskegee experiments . <p> Even today , there are troublesome cases that keep regulators , doctors and ethicists up all night . A two-year old girl died recently when doctors forwent a known surgical cure for her bladder cancer and gave her an experimental drug instead . We still have lapses . And we still have the pull of experiment 's inverse relationship . In all but the rarest of cases , we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human welfare anymore . So when little girls die in research , or when mentally ill patients are subjected to experimental harm , or when pregnant women do n't know they are in studies , it is a systemic problem : one that points out inherent flaws both in the way the government is organized to protect citizens , and in the very nature of having some human beings poke , prod , cut and drug the rest of us . <p> In 1995 , President Clinton wrote an executive order creating a National Bioethics Advisory Commission ( NBAC ) , composed of doctors , lawyers , and ethicists from around the country . In renewing its mandate in 1997 , he said that , " Science must respect the dignity of every American . We must never allow our citizens to be unwitting guinea pigs in scientific experiments . " NBAC resolved that the president 's goal would be met if every subject in a medical trial enjoyed two protections : informed consent and independent review of research . Informed consent means that patients know everything they need to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they willingly agree to submit to the research . Independent review means that researchers open their studies to outside observers ( usually a committee of doctors and community members ) so that a disinterested party can assess their ethics . <p> But commission members say the president 's goal has not been met ; Americans are not as safe as they could be . Federal protections do not cover all research . And the research the government does oversee is on shaky ground . Informing patients to get consent is difficult because average patients and average doctors speak very different languages . And independent review is compromised by mounting pressures for institutions to make money through medical discovery : A culture of " approve it now , ask questions later " pervades the research community . It may not be long before Americans lack up-front guarantees that what doctors do to them is needed , ethical , and benign . Earlier this year , the commission put it this way in a memo to the president , " The U.S. Government can not know how many Americans currently are subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruited , can not ensure that research subjects know and understand the risks they are undertaking , and can not ascertain whether they have been harmed ? ' <p> Why ? First there is the problem of jurisdiction . As the law stands , the federal government oversees research it funds ( the lion 's share is an annual $12 billion in grants from the National Institutes of Health ) , and regulates research that will lead to products sold in interstate commerce ( FDA trials ) . Some states , such as California , have laws about the ethical treatment of subjects ; many do not . But that leaves a lot of research out of government 's reach . Small institutions , such as fertility clinics , privately funded laboratories , small universities , and weight centers are essentially free to do whatever they want to patients who walk in and sign forms . Despite President Clinton 's wish that no American be a guinea pig , those who want to lose weight , who need help conceiving , or who are simply pulled in by offers of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least until the next wave of Federalism sweeps the country . Though subjects in these studies theoretically have redress through state tort laws , proving medical abuse is difficult . What seems to frustrate NBAC members most on this count is that they can not discover how many Americans are subjects , abused or not , in such studies . Says one Bioethics Commissioner , Alta Charo , a lawyer at University of Wisconsin , Madison , " We are advocating for a solution in terms of a problem , but we do n't have any idea whether the problem is big or small . " <p> NBAC is not alone in this concern . Last year , the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services ( which includes NIH ) issued a report saying that " Ithe long-established system for protecting human research subjects has vulnerabilities that threaten its effectiveness , " and that given the new realities of the medical marketplace  --  genomics , stem cells , cloning , for-profit medicine , and the ever increasing drive to publish results  --  these vulnerabilities are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a Veterans Affairs facility in Los Angeles had their research shut down this spring by NIH 's oversight arm , the Office for Protection from Research Risks ( OPRR ) . Neither institution was accused of actually harming patients . OPRR took the drastic measure of halting all research because each had violated a technical regulation for independent review ( Duke did n't remove review board members that OPRR wanted removed ; the V.A . approved studies without a review board quorum present . ) In other words , the vulnerabilities of the system are apparent enough to the regulators that small slips require serious response . It is possible that the line between healthy research and freezing humans on blocks of ice is just that thin . <p> Here 's how the current system works : the government , through OPRR , gets assurances from institutions that they will oversee the ethical treatment of subjects in the government 's stead . The institution fulfills that assurance to OPRR by setting up institutional review boards ( IRBs ) to review research proposals before they begin . IRBs are composed mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a non-affiliated community member . These committees examine the research proposals to make sure they are ethically designed . Once an IRB approves a study , the researcher is on his own to sign up subjects , pending informed consent , and conduct the study for up to a year , when the research must be re-approved by the IRB . During that year , the doctor is on his own . The government leaves it to the institution , the institution leaves it to the IRB , the IRB adjusts what it wants and then leaves it to the investigator . And the investigator leaves it to the subject , in so far as he can experiment only on willing and informed volunteers . <p> The vulnerabilities in our system of protecting subjects starts with the difficulty of ensuring that volunteers are willing and informed . How does an investigator tell an average person what her study entails ? How do you sign up people for a gene therapy trial when most people do n't know what genes are ? Investigators try to pitch information on a sixth to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NBAC , ' Americans are very poor at interpreting statistical information . They have binary attitudes . They have trouble with assessing a 3/10ths chance ? ' According to the Inspector General 's report , " Many individuals have signed up to participate in research trials with little understanding of the distinction between research and standard therapy . " This is called the therapeutic misconception-my doctor is asking me to do something ; it must be in order to treat me . The case of the man who was sure he was in therapy for his heart condition but was actually in an experiment  --  and died not knowing better  --  is a classic example . <p> Regulators fear this is a common problem because investigators often use their own patients in studies . And the confusion of roles may not be just the patient 's . An investigator 's focus in a trial is science , which requires filling the research protocol set ahead of time and not making individual adjustments for any one subject . If the investigator is also a subject 's clinician , then , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who is looking out expressly for his interests and modulating care to suit his needs . The priorities are different enough , says James Childress , another NBAC commissioner , that the Hippocratic oath itself is in conflict for the clinician-investigator . Guiding the science that will help future patients and attending the needs of current subject-patients are different goals . " Those goals can come into conflict at times , " says Childress . The inverse relationship between knowledge and care rears its head . <p> However , the number of actual abuses is not as high as it could be , given the power doctors have over generally willing subjects . NBAC commissioners , the Inspector General 's report , and OPRR officials  --  despite their worries about systemic weaknesses  --  all credit the culture of the American medical profession with an outstanding sense of ethics . This century , we have added 26 years to our average life expectancy in this country-thanks in large part to medical interventions tested on human subjects and nutritional knowledge assayed in clinical trials . And the number of abuses is " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The egalitarian nature of science assists in this good record . There are no lone wolves in medicine ( weight-loss clinics aside ) . Just as science dictates that all findings be reviewed by the doubting eyes of peers , fifty years of medical tradition dictate that all proposed research undergo ethical screening by an institutional review board . <p> These review boards , made up mostly of doctors , do three things to protect human subjects . They assure that the proposed research is going to lead to worthwhile results  --  science must learn something by doing these things to humans . They shave risk off the research protocol so that human subjects are as unexposed to risk as possible , given what the investigator is trying to find out ( heart surgery trials usually involve high risk ; smoking cessation trials should not ) . And IRBs worry about informed consent . Review boards must have a non-doctor community representative on them . Their primary purpose is to help word the consent information to prevent therapeutic misconception and to ensure that the information includes all a subject needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it , transient diarrhea in a drug trial may not be medically significant to an investigator . But it is highly significant to potential subjects deciding whether to sign up . <p> A more serious example of the need for IRB review comes from Jonathan Moreno , a professor of ethics at the University of Virginia , who has just written a history of human subjects research called Undue Risk . A certain set of children have a condition that stunts their growth and impairs their cognitive ability . A respectable investigator submitted to his IRB a protocol to test whether a certain treatment would help these children grow . He was sure the regime would do nothing for their IQs . There was also a minimal cancer risk associated with the drugs . The researcher 's informed consent packet left out the parts about cancer and not helping the IQ . He was not being devious , says Moreno ; he was just so focused on the science of the study  --  would the treatment help growth ?  --  that he neglected information crucial to the parents who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved by the IRB until he reworked the information packet . <p> Moreno and other ethicists , as well as NBAC , and the Inspector General worry about what would happen if IRBs stopped being thoughtful . What if they became rubber-stamp approval boards , rather than deliberative bodies with the power to alter protocols ? It is a change that regulators do not want to see . However well-meaning individual investigators are , the ethical sense of the medical community does not reside in each doctor individually any more than does scientific truth . One investigator 's results are not scientific truth until others assess them and agree . The same is true for ethical treatment of human subjects . An investigator 's judgment of proper treatment is always jeopardized by the inverse relationship rule . The temptation , however unconscious , to increase risk to gain return is ever-present . That 's why outside eyes and independent adjustment are needed . <p> Nevertheless , IRBs are being squeezed for time and resources . The old , hallowed halls of academic research are rapidly changing as managed care and pharmaceutical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want more research done faster , for the prestige  --  and bottom line  --  of the institution . <p> A public affairs official for the VA . contends that institutions all over the country cut corners . " Many of us feel under-appreciated , " says Dr. David Gaba , the chair of one of Stanford University 's two medical IRBs . " The work is unrelenting . It does n't wax and wane " In fact , it just waxes . His IRB oversaw 1,350 protocols last year , meeting once a month for four hours . Members do spend time at home reading and reviewing , but the statutory work of meeting to amend and vote on research proposals is limited to just over two minutes per protocol on average . And the number of protocols increases 7 to 10 percent annually . Stanford  --  an institution that has not yet run into trouble with OPRR  --  is adding a third medical IRB to ease the burden on members , a move the Inspector General of Health and Human Services applauds . But many institutions are not adding IRBs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In addition to being " overworked and overwhelmed " as one ethicist put it , IRB members must endure what amounts to begrudging tolerance among researchers . " I 've been doing research with human subjects for many years , " says Dr. Marguerite Hays , a VA . administrator and researcher . " I find it very frustrating to have to wait for a committee to tell me I can make a small change in protocol ? ' That wait averages 37 days in academic settings  --  too long for the new market pace . Most doctors consider themselves ethically equal to IRB members and scientifically superior to them in their own sphere of study . For the members of the review boards , it is hard to ignore that attitude . " Every time you find something wrong , you are risking the irritation of your own colleagues at your institution  --  and you are giving yourself more work , " says Alta Char ) of NBAC . <p> Almost no one in the medical community argues that review boards are unnecessary . ( For one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to IRB-approved protocols are exculpable , should ethical questions arise . ) But no one is moving to make sitting on review boards any easier . In the words of one reviewer , " The need to cost out all your services is becoming more critical to the institution . Service on an IRB is not billable time . " That is true for the institution and it is true for the IRB members , who are not generally paid for IRB work . David Gaba thinks IRB service " should be viewed as a positive thing in your academic promotion . But getting a couple of studies published is viewed as 100 times more important to your promotion . " <p> The situation is only going to worsen as the pace of research increases , as the need for money and fame that come from research grows , and as the content of research becomes more ethically challenging . Genetics and stem cell research and privacy issues in studies such as AIDS trials are giving IRBs complex issues that need more time , not less . <p> So far , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut back on their IRBs . ( OPRR 's method is money  --  it holds the purse strings from the government and can freeze NIH-funded research immediately ) . But OPRR officer Tom Puglisi claims " OPRR is small for the task it has to do . We 're overseeing 5,000 institutions . My staff consists of 15 people . It 's a system of monitored self-regulation ? ' OPRR makes very few site visits . Its ability to ensure the protection of human subjects in research relies on assurances from institutions that they will do the right thing . And the IRB is the crux of that assurance . <p> Because NIH is in the business of giving out money for clinical trials , OPRR is naturally reluctant to shut down research . The government wants doctors everywhere to experiment on human beings . That 's how medicine is advanced , how discoveries are made , how you and I live longer . But against a backdrop of Nazi experiments and the Tuskegee syphilis trials , medicine must be careful . Despite her frustration with IRBs , Dr. Hays cautions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EU countries have banned diagnostic tests involving radioactive tracers ( common here , and harmless ) . " I think that this is a reaction that legislators have to what they see as abuses . We have to be very careful not only not to allow abuses , but not to allow the appearance of abuses . You may find that you are not allowed to do the research at all ? ' <p> Research on fellow humans is a privilege , not a right . Both the flow of government cash and the willing trust of potential subjects could dry up if medical research institutions are n't careful . Without the safeguards of informed consent and robust independent review , research trips itself , says NBAC 's James Childress . Abuse invites reactionary legislation  --  and , with it , the loss of the research privilege and its contribution to the greater good . " It is protection that provides the basis of trust that makes it possible for subjects to participate , " he says .
