Section : Science &; society ; Cover story <p> Behold , I bring you good tidings of great joy , which shall be to all people . For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior , which is Christ the Lord . The Gospel according to Luke <p> <p> To Christians through the ages , the Christmas story proclaims the advent of a Savior , the imponderable miracle of God 's invasion of human history through a stable in Bethlehem nearly 2,000 years ago . While the accounts of Jesus 's death and Resurrection are arguably more central to the Christian faith , the story of his Nativity is easily the more familiar and beloved . It is the basis of one of Christianity 's holiest observances . Believers and nonbelievers alike celebrate it by following the example of the Magi who paid homage to the Christ child by the giving of gifts . Today , millions around the world still find hope for peace on Earth and goodwill toward men wrapped in the warm and comforting images of an infant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yet as familiar and enchanting as it is , the Christmas story  --  like much of the Bible itself  --  has come under intense scrutiny in recent years . Since the rise of critical analysis in modern academia more than a century ago , New Testament scholars have debated whether the Nativity stories should be understood as history , religious legend , theological proclamation or perhaps a combination of the three . Using the tools of modern archaeology and textual research , scholars in recent years have re-examined the story in search of new insights into its meaning and content . While many have come to reject the historical veracity of at least some of the details , many others have found little reason to alter traditional understanding of a story that , at its heart , is a call to faith in a supernatural God . <p> While recent archaeological discoveries and ancient nonbiblical writings have shed some new light on the historical context of the events , the New Testament remains virtually the only source of details concerning the birth of Jesus of Nazareth . Even there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Matthew 's , believed written about A.D. 90 , and Luke 's , written a few years before . The Gospels of Mark and John begin with the baptism of an adult Jesus . <p> Many scholars conclude that the Nativity stories were not part of the earliest Christian traditions . While the Resurrection of Jesus was celebrated from the very start , observance of the Nativity did not gain a wide following until the fifth century A.D. The first Christian preaching , as recorded in the Book of Acts and in the epistles of Paul , also focused on the Resurrection as evidence that Jesus was the Christ , but made no mention of a miraculous birth accompanied by the acclaim of angels and visiting Magi . Had New Testament writers seen anything worthy of note in the events connected with Jesus 's conception and birth , ' says Rolland Wolfe , professor emeritus of biblical literature at Tufts University , it seems they would have made thousands of references to it . ' <p> Where then , did the stories come from ? Most scholars agree that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians who , believing Jesus to be both human and divine , sought to understand how and when he came to be . While the texts do not spell out their sources , some scholars have suggested that Luke 's version is based on Mary 's recollections , while Joseph is the source of Matthew 's narrative . The writer of Luke explains in his opening lines that he investigated everything carefully ' in order to write the exact truth ' about events he had not personally witnessed . Many scholars find no reason to doubt that Luke may have spoken to Mary or at least obtained her story from others . <p> Others , however , argue that sharp disagreements on some details make it unlikely that family members could have been the source of the infancy material . Matthew , for example , has Joseph and Mary taking the newborn baby to Egypt to avoid a plot on his life . Luke has them staying in Bethlehem and Jerusalem for at least a month and then going home to Nazareth . Some scholars seek to harmonize such differences by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address different questions . Others see the discrepancies as more problematic . The two narratives are not only different , ' says Raymond E. Brown , professor emeritus of New Testament at Union Theological Seminary in New York , they are contrary to each other in a number of details . ' Brown , in his widely cited book The Birth of the Messiah , ' concludes it is unlikely that either account is completely historical . ' <p> Few scholars are terribly concerned by the discrepancies . Most agree that writing an objective history or a biography was not at all what the Gospel writers had in mind . The main question for the people at the time was What does this birth mean for our faith ? ' ' says Brennan Hill , a theology professor at Xavier University in Cincinnati . They did not spend much time with the question that we might ask today : What really happened ? ' ' The Nativity story , adds Donald Hagner , professor of New Testament at Fuller Theological Seminary , Pasadena , Calif. , " was not told for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate a deeper meaning  --  the theological significance of Jesus as the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy . ' On that score , says Professor Brown , whatever doubts may be cast on the Nativity accounts as history , as theological truth they remain intact . The Birth <p> And Joseph also went up from Galilee ... unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem ... to be taxed with Mary , his espoused wife .... And so it was that while they were there ... she brought forth her firstborn son , and wrapped him in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger . The Gospel according to Luke <p> <p> Whatever their differences on other details of the Nativity , the two Gospels agree that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near the end of the reign of Herod the Great  --  perhaps between 6 B.C. and 4 B.C.  --  to a virgin named Mary whose husband , Joseph , was a descendant of King David 's . All of this , according to the Gospel writers , was to fulfill Old Testament prophecies that a virgin shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name Immanuel , ' and that out of Bethlehem one will go forth ... to be ruler in Israel . ' <p> While the virginal conception of Jesus seems not to have been a part of the earliest Christian preaching and is mentioned only in Matthew 's and Luke 's Gospels , most scholars are convinced it has some basis in early Christian tradition . Yet whether it is strictly historical or merely a vehicle for theological teaching remains , as it has been for centuries , a subject of considerable dispute . In A.D. 178 , the pagan writer Celsus wrote a fanciful parody of Matthew 's Gospel , portraying Jesus as the illegitimate son of a Roman soldier . In a more modern attack on the doctrine , Episcopal Bishop John Spong , in a new book , Born of a Woman , ' describes the virginal conception as a myth and asserts that Jesus may have been born to a sexually violated girl . In the final analysis , says John P. Meier , professor of New Testament at the Catholic University of America , judging the historicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views about the miraculous and the weight one gives to later Church teachings . ' <p> The setting of Jesus 's birth in the Christmas story is nearly as important as its nature . The fact that , during his ministry , Jesus was known to have come from Nazareth rather than from Bethlehem constituted a problem ' for the writers of Matthew and Luke , says Hagner of Fuller Theological Seminary . Listeners familiar with Old Testament prophecies no doubt would have questioned how a native son of Nazareth could be the Messiah . That complication , says Hagner , may explain why both Matthew and Luke emphasize Bethlehem as Jesus 's birthplace and why they tell intricate and seemingly differing stories to get him back to Nazareth . <p> In Luke 's Gospel , Joseph and Mary go to Bethlehem from their home in Nazareth to be counted in a census of all the inhabited earth ' ordered by Caesar Augustus . The census , Luke says , was the first taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria , ' and it required all to go to their native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the story more as myth than history ask why a very pregnant Mary would make such an arduous 80-to-90-mile trip when Joseph could easily have responded to the census alone . But Paul Maier , professor of ancient history at Western Michigan University , in his book , In the Fullness of Time , ' suggests that Mary had every reason to make the trip . ' She probably knew of the Old Testament prophecies that the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem , says Maier , and no doubt was puzzled about why God had chosen a girl from Nazareth . The Roman emperor 's census decree , says Maier , placed the last piece of the divine-human puzzle into place . ' <p> But many historians have found Luke 's reference to an empire-wide census puzzling . Outside of the Bible , there is no historical record of a universal census ordered by Caesar Augustus , nor , as Professor Brown of Union seminary notes , of a census requirement that people be registered in their ancestral cities . ' While records do exist of censuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.D. 14 , they all apparently involved only Roman citizens . <p> There also are records of many smaller censuses of non-Romans in the provinces , mainly for taxing purposes . Some scholars suggest it may have been one of those that Luke recalled . However , the only known census involving Quirinius as governor of Syria occurred in A.D. 6 . That was nearly a decade after the death of Herod the Great , a key figure in Matthew 's Nativity story . <p> Some scholars defend the historicity of Luke 's account by arguing that the discrepancy is not the result of Luke 's error but of his translators . The problem is solved , wrote Nigel Turner , a Greek scholar from the University of Edinburgh , Scotland , if the passage is translated correctly : This census was before the census taken when Quirinius was governor . ' That view is widely disputed . <p> More important than the details , says Brown , may be Luke 's purpose in reporting the census as the reason for the trip : To show that the Roman emperor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan ... by providing the setting for the birth of the Savior . ' <p> The popular depiction of the Christmas creche also has been subjected to revisionism . In the traditional interpretation of Luke , Joseph and Mary arrive late in Bethlehem and , finding no room at the inn , spend the night in a stable or cave where the baby is born . But Kenneth E. Bailey , professor of New Testament at the Tantur Ecumenical Institute in Jerusalem , describes that as a creative expansion of Luke 's Gospel , which says simply that after Mary gave birth to Jesus she laid him in a manger because there was no room in the inn . ' <p> Bailey thinks Jesus was born not in a stable but on the ground floor of a typical two-level Bethlehem house , in a room where animals were led in at night . He argues that the Greek word for inn ' also can be translated house ' or guest house . ' Mary and Joseph , says Bailey , probably were invited into the ground-floor room because the guest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean old innkeeper ' and sent to a cold drafty stable , ' says Bailey Joseph finds shelter for his family in a simple peasant home . ' <p> Matthew 's Gospel seems to give a much different picture of events surrounding the birth . There are no depictions of the Nativity scene itself , nor of Joseph and Mary traveling from Nazareth . The narrator simply states that when Jesus was born in Bethlehem ' Magi from the East came to visit . When they arrive , the Magi enter into the house . ' While some scholars believe that Matthew simply chose to omit the details of Mary and Joseph 's travels , others conclude from the Gospel that the couple lived in Bethlehem all along . <p> For Matthew , the more fascinating chapter of the Christmas story entails the holy family 's move from Bethlehem to Nazareth following the birth . It is a dramatic story of a wicked king and a terrifying plot against Jesus 's life that Luke never bothers to tell . The Visitors <p> There came wise men ... to Jerusalem saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? For we have seen his star in the East and are come to worship him . The Gospel according to Matthew <p> <p> The holy family did not celebrate the Nativity alone . In Luke 's Gospel , an angel announces the royal birth to local shepherds , who find their way to the baby 's side . In Matthew 's account , Magi  --  or wise men ' in some translations  --  arrive bearing precious gifts to pay homage to the newborn king . <p> But the Magi 's courtesy call , as Matthew tells it , was just the beginning of a harrowing chapter in the Christmas story . When the Magi stopped in Jerusalem to ask directions , their inquiries about a newborn king immediately stirred up trouble . A jealous King Herod , hearing of the Magi 's quest , secretly plotted to find and kill the child  --  a plot that sent Joseph , Mary and their newborn into Egypt as refugees and resulted in the slaughter of all of Bethlehem 's male infants . <p> While these are easily the most dramatic of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaughter of the innocents ' have also attracted the most skepticism through the years . Many scholars have simply dismissed the stories as nonhistorical , citing a lack ofcorroboration from other sources either for the atrocity in Bethlehem or for an astral phenomenon over the Middle Eastern skies that might have been the Magi 's guiding star . Instead they view the stories as midrash  --  theological elaborations of other biblical motifs  --  or as allegories intended to evoke the story of Moses , who also escaped an infant slaughter and came out of Egypt . ' Some view the Magi mainly as an allegorical symbol for gentiles of Matthew 's time who responded as believers to the Christian message when many Jews did not . <p> Many scholars , however , are now convinced that the stories have been dismissed too easily . They contend that there is reason to believe that the Magi , the star and the atrocity at Bethlehem are rooted in history , although getting to those historical roots requires peeling away layers of embellishment from the intervening centuries . The Magi , for example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' even though Matthew does not describe them as royalty or say how many there were . Those traditions , says Professor Brown of Union Theological Seminary , grew up in the church between the second and fifth centuries . The number three was probably affixed based on the three gifts of gold , frankincense and myrrh that Matthew describes . By the sixth century , the tradition had been elaborated to the point of assigning the Magi names  --  Gaspar , Melchior and Balthasar  --  as well as ages and skin color . Little weight is given to those traditions today . <p> What seems more likely to some biblical scholars is that the Magi of Matthew were astrologers from Persia or Mesopotamia who were drawn to Bethlehem by a significant alignment of stars and planets indicating to them that a ruler had been born . According to Professor Maier of Western Michigan University , just such a configuration occurred in 6 B.C. , when Jupiter , Saturn and Mars drew close in the constellation of Pisces  --  an event that occurs every 805 years . In ancient astrology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet ' and Saturn the shield of Palestine , while Pisces represented epochal events . So to astrologers of the time , he says , the conjunction would have meant that a cosmic ruler or king was to appear in Palestine at the culmination of history . ' <p> To many scholars , this is more plausible than the sudden appearance of a spectacular star in the night sky , as depicted by tradition . It also would explain why Herod and his court seemed unaware of the star and why no other historical sources mention it . But it does not explain what Matthew seems to describe as a star moving and standing over the house where the young child was . ' While a few have suggested the Bethlehem star might have been a comet or a nova , those scenarios have drawn fewer supporters . Some biblical commentators argue simply that the Bethlehem star must be chalked up as a unique supernatural event that can not be explained naturally . <p> Well-worn arguments against the historicity of the Bethlehem slaughter are also getting new scrutiny today . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atrocityof the magnitude that Matthew describes  --  the killing of all boys up to 2 years old in the town and vicinity  --  certainly would have been noted by the first-century historian Josephus , who documented the final years of Herod 's reign . Some church estimates have set the death toll as high as 64,000 . <p> But some scholars now argue that the incident must have been much smaller in scope . Professor Hagner of Fuller Theological Seminary estimates that the population of Bethlehem in those days was probably no more than 1,000 , and that there could have been as few as 20 infants under 2 . As despicable as it was , says Hagner , the massacre of 10 or 12 babies in a small town may well have escaped Josephus 's attention , especially when compared with other grisly deeds of Herod 's that the historian did record . Herod had a number of Torah scholars burned alive for removing Rome 's golden eagle from the Temple gate , for example . He also had his wife and some of his sons murdered because he considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be universal mourning associated with his death , he ordered thousands of men locked inside the hippodrome in Jericho to be massacred when he died  --  an order never carried out . Provided Josephus had even heard of the Bethlehem murders , Professor Maier asks : Which events would he have been likely to include in his history as he was trying to wind up Herod 's rotting life ? ' <p> While scholars who make such arguments concede there is no direct evidence corroborating Matthew 's account of the Bethlehem slaughter , they say the story is far from implausible . The manic Herod who appears in the Gospel , says Hagner , is entirely consistent ' with Josephus 's portrait andreflects the way Herod would have responded to the Magi . ' Even the Roman Caesar Augustus is quoted as saying of his Judean pawn : I 'd rather be Herod 's pig than his son . ' <p> Ultimately more important in Matthew 's story is that Joseph , alerted to the peril by an angel , escaped with his wife and child to Egypt unharmed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt , Matthew does not say , although a number of legends have survived . In Old Cairo 's Coptic quarter , a crypt under the church of St. Sergius is venerated as the place where the holy family stayed for three months . At another site outside Cairo , near the Heliopolis , Christians since the fifth century have honored the Tree of Mary , ' a sycamore under which Mary is said to have sought shade . <p> Apocryphal writings from the second century purport to provide some additional details about the family 's life in exile . The Arabic Gospel of the Infancy , for example , describes the holy family 's being waylaid by robbers on a road in Sinai . When the highwaymen found nothing worth stealing , they took pity on the family and sent them on their way with fresh provisions . According to the tale , one of the robbers turned up 30 years later as one of the two thieves crucified with Jesus  --  the repentant one to whom Jesus said , This day you 'll be with me in paradise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew 's Gospel , when Herod died and an angel gave Joseph the all-clear to return with his family to Israel . But when Joseph and Mary learned that the new ruler , Herod 's son Archelaus , had begun his reign by slaughtering 3,000 Jews in Jerusalem , they decided to look north toward the more pastoral region of Galilee . They settled in the dusty little town of Nazareth . The Aftermath <p> And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature , and in favor with God and man . The Gospel according to Luke <p> <p> Virtually nothing is known of the details of Jesus 's life during the nearly three decades between his infancy and the start of his ministry  --  a period Bible scholars have come to call the hidden years . ' Except for a brief episode where Jesus visits the Temple in Jerusalem at age 12 , the New Testament is silent on his coming of age . While those details may never be recovered , new archaeological and historical research is providing some revealing glimpses into the personal , religious and social influences that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethlehem . <p> The age-old desire to fill the gaps in Jesus 's biography is evident in noncanonical writings dating to the second century A.D. , some of which purport to tell miracle stories from Jesus 's childhood . The apocryphal Infancy Gospel of Thomas , for example , depicts a 5-year-old Jesus bringing dried fish and clay sparrows to life . It also portrays him displaying an ornery streak : A playmate drops dead after Jesus curses him for accidentally hitting his shoulder , and when Joseph reprimands him for it , Jesus warns : I am not thine . Vex me not ! ' Though such accounts make fascinating reading , scholars say they have no historical basis . <p> Even so , there is consensus on some facts of Jesus 's boyhood . Most scholars agree that he grew up in Nazareth , where he learned the carpenter 's trade , probably from Joseph . According to the early-church father Justin Martyr , Jesus and Joseph specialized in making wooden yokes and plows . They were of such excellent quality , Justin wrote , that some were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , Jesus no doubt attended the village 's synagogue school , where he would have studied the Torah and learned Hebrew . He probably also learned Greek and Latin . The New Testament says Jesus had four brothers  --  James , Joses , Jude and Simon  --  and at least two unnamed sisters , although these may have been cousins . As the firstborn , he probably received special attention , which no doubt produced some sibling rivalry . John 's Gospel notes that during Jesus 's ministry , his brothers did not believe in him . Unlike Mary , Joseph does not reappear in the Gospels and probably died before Jesus turned 30 . <p> Even though Jesus 's hometown was a peaceful rural village of about 1,600 people , the lower Galilee region surrounding Nazareth was no rural backwater . Recently uncovered archaeological ruins of numerous cities and towns in the area suggest to some that the region was one of the most densely populated of the Roman Empire . Life in lower Galilee , says J. Andrew Overman , a religion professor at the University of Rochester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as urbanized and urbane as anywhere else in the empire . ' It was also considered a hotbed of anti-Roman feeling and messianic hopes  --  an area , says Professor Hill of Xavier University , where bands of brigands and robbers roamed looking for victims . ' That may help explain why during his ministry Jesus was sometimes branded a rebel and a troublemaker . <p> Though he was raised in a devoutly religious home and may not have traveled far , Jesus was probably exposed to considerable intellectual diversity . Just 4 miles from Nazareth , about a one-hour walk , was the provincial capital of Sepphoris , a cosmopolitan center of culture and commerce . Some scholars speculate that Jesus may well have found carpentry work there and , as a result , would have come into contact with the urban culture of a major Hellenistic city . <p> Just how much Jesus was influenced by his world is ultimately a question for theologians to ponder . Was he always aware of his special calling ? Did he know what lay ahead ? As the child grew in wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps he , too , marveled at stories of angels , shepherds and Magi at a Bethlehem manger . <p> PHOTO : The Adoration of the Magi ' ( BOTTICELLI/NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART ) <p> PHOTO : The Vision of St. Joseph ' ( PHILLIPE DE CHAMPAIGNE/THE GRANGER COLLECTION ) <p> PHOTO : Adoration of the Shepherds ' ( GIORGIONE/THE GRANGER COLLECTION ) <p> PHOTO : Ride of the Magi ' by Benozzo ( GOZZOLI/THE GRANGER COLLECTION ) <p> PHOTO : The Slaughter of the Innocents ' ( POUSSIN/ART RESOURCE ) <p> PHOTO : Christ in the House of his Parents ' ( JOHN EVERETT MILLAIS/ART RESOURCE ) <p> By Jeffery L.
