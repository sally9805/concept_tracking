<p> Destruction hallmarked the previous century : The coal-fired Industrial Revolution belched filth into the skies , economic avarice tore up the landscape , and wanton slaughter made many species extinct . <p> Yet in the midst of the carnage emerged a nascent conservation ethic : In 1864 , Abraham Lincoln signed an order saving California 's towering sequoia trees from the ax ; in 1872 Congress established Yellowstone as the first national park ; in 1894 New York state preserved a stretch of the Adirondack mountains as the country 's first official wilderness , and in 1898 , Boulder set aside the Flatirons as a new kind of city park , one where nature , not manicured gardens , ruled . <p> Our own century , too , will bequeath a complex legacy of problems and victories . The inheritance includes several ideas that fundamentally changed how the nation , and ultimately industrialized societies worldwide , think about the environment . Based on conversations with dozens of environmental leaders , in Colorado and internationally , here are a few of the 20th century 's best efforts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This federal law represented a sea change in the American mentality . For almost four centuries , the United States touted a philosophy of ' conquering the wilderness . ' But this act committed America instead to preserving the wilderness . Certain public lands are off-limits to mechanized vehicles and industrial consumption ; just because we could tear up the landscape does n't mean that we should . The underlying concept - of humans consciously showing self-restraint to preserve nature - is imperative if we are to fix the many other environmental woes still facing our planet . <p> Initially , Colorado got just a handful of designated wilderness areas : the Maroon Bells near Aspen , Mount Zirkel near Steamboat Springs , La Garita near Gunnison and the Rawah west of Fort Collins . But since 1964 , Congress has added to the nation 's wilderness system several times , including scattered areas in Colorado in 1975 , 1976 , 1980 , 1984 and 1993 . <p> However , only a fraction of all public land in the entire country , including Colorado , is official wilderness ; most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A political battle still rages over pending proposals to give wilderness protection to Colorado 's spectacular desert canyons , some river ecosystems and the few remaining uncut or ' virgin ' forests . <p> Other 20th-century achievements include : <p> 1901-1909 . Theodore Roosevelt 's presidency . The former Rough Rider saved the Grand Canyon from being strip-mined by declaring the great gorge a national monument . In other bold moves , Roosevelt also : created the U.S. Forest Service ; added 150 million acres to the national forests ; set up five national parks , 18 national monuments , 51 federal bird reservations and the country 's first federal game preserve . He thus established the basic conservation and management system that still presides over America 's public lands today . Mesa Verde , Colorado 's first national park , is part of Roosevelt 's legacy . <p> Meantime , he pushed Congress into adopting landmark legislation keeping food and medicines safe . <p> Roosevelt 's idea - that the government should protect the larger public good - is fundamental to every consumer safety and environmental law that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stalwarts like mountain climber Enos Mills , Coloradans started pushing for the park 's establishment early in this century . But the 1915 congressional act left out many spectacular , critical areas , so citizens had to seek 14 boundary additions to make the park the size it is today . Even so , just last year Congress acted to protect one of the park 's most precious assets - peace and quiet - from a noisy invasion of low-flying airplane and helicopter tours . Rocky Mountain National Park illustrates two propositions : One , that citizen activism is crucial to preserving natural treasures ; and two , that the job is never really finished . <p> 1917 . Margaret Sanger and the founding of Planned Parenthood . Until Sanger , people assumed they had no control over when , how many or even if they will have children . But Sanger showed that humans could make choices . <p> Sanger 's efforts began one of the most important environmental tasks of our century : to prevent the expanding human population from overrunning our planet . <p> In recent decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options - is key to both economic and environmental progress worldwide . Today , that message continues to be spread by **27;1666;TOOLONG like Dottie Lamm , Colorado 's former first lady . <p> 1962 . ' Silent Spring . ' This book , in which Rachel Carson documented how pesticides like DDT were destroying America 's birds , shook modern people 's unquestioning faith in their industrial technology . Controversy over pesticides and other chemicals still rages . But today , scientists at Colorado State University and other institutions are researching how humankind can feed itself without damaging the environment . And millions of young people are still inspired by Carson 's articulate , reasoned call to safeguard our wondrous planet . <p> 1967 . Urban Open Space/Mountain Parks . Boulder began its mountain park system in 898 , and , by 1912 , Denver had set up its mountain park system . But with laudable foresight and self-sacrifice , 33 years ago Boulder citizens voted to tax themselves to preserve undeveloped open areas close to the city for public use , both as a land-use planning tool and for close-to-home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important as the Denver-Boulder area becomes more crowded and urbanized , and many other municipalities have started their own open-space programs . <p> 1968-1974 . Richard Nixon 's presidency . Whatever his failings , Nixon was among America 's greatest environmental presidents . Under his leadership , the country embraced an elevated environmental awareness , including the Clean Air Act , the Clean Water Act , the Endangered Species Act , the Marine Mammal Protection Act and a commitment to mopping up dangerous waste sites under the Superfund program . <p> During his tenure , the United States also adopted the National Environmental Protection Act , which strengthened and consolidated more than a dozen previously scattered programs into an umbrella authority , the Environmental Protection Agency . Most important , the law required the federal government to carefully study the consequences of its actions . <p> Nixon 's lasting contribution was a fundamental change in how we , as a nation , make decisions that affect the environment . <p> 1980 . The Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act . A bitter political battle preceded the preservation of 104 million acres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wildlife refuges and conservation areas . <p> Through this act , signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter , America tried to avoid repeating the mistakes that had destroyed most pristine areas in the lower 48 states . <p> Many Americans told pollsters , then and since , that even if they never personally visited Alaska , just knowing that the magnificent wilderness was still there was enough . <p> The Alaska lands act built upon the 1964 Wilderness Act 's philosophy and further articulated the national interest in preservation . <p> However , the Alaska lands act today is under attack , including proposals to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling . Meantime , Americans continue their love affair with gas-guzzling cars . <p> Indeed , as environmentalism moved into mainstream politics during the past two decades , many citizens grew complacent , figuring that the job of saving the planet already had been achieved . It has n't . Meanwhile , ideas about environmental protection have grown polarized and partisan - starting with Ronald Reagan , a succession of GOP presidents and congresses deserted the progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even during Bill Clinton 's unfocused , tepid Democratic presidency , much citizen effort has gone toward just halting further degradation of our natural treasures , not expanding on the wealth of conservation ideas previous leaders had created . <p> As our generation stands in the doorway to a new century , we should ask ourselves if we can renew our nation 's commitment to environmental protection . <p> 20TH CENTURY 'S LEGACY <p> Although the United States invented the national park concept in the 19th Century , all the national parks in Colorado were authorized this century .
