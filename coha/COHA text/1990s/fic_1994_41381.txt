Anna do you remember ? Can you still hear me singing it ? <p> It is the voice I hear the gentle voice I hear that calls me home ? <p> They sang it for me Anna . They sang it for me , and Anna , had I any doubts about how they saw me and that in coming home I had done the right thing , I could now lay them to rest along with that crumbled old body to keep which in one piece had taken too much from too many people these past four years . <p> Upon the hill the rising sun , <p> they sang and I could n't help but add my own tone deaf notes to that song I still love so , sang in a way I still love so , <p> It is the voice that calls me home . <p> My song Anna . It has no written score . Succeeding generations of us , on each of our occasions have , like you , simply appointed their own tenor , their own alto , their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score by those who wrote it . <p> It is the voice I hear That calls me home <p> LOUISIANA <p> calls me Upon the hill on the The rising sun rising I hear them say " come unto me " It is the voooice that calls me home , <p> making fifteen minutes out of a three minute piece , a flying saucer out of a John Crow blow nose  --  I once drew that for you Anna ,  --  a compact disc out of that soft perforated red fungus . <p> And they were all there . Every jack one of them I had told you about was there to celebrate my translation . They came in carts and every scrammie there was ; they came through short cuts with their shoes in their hands ; up shalley hillsides with nothing but coconut oil on their feet . They came in groups ; they came alone . They came with banners : Mizpah 1 , Mizpah 2 , Mutual Association Benefit Society , Daughters of the King , Brotherhood of St Andrew , Ethiopian Burial Scheme no. 1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words embossed in opposite colours , tassels flying ; they came in long white gloves ; they came with swords ; Ezekiel 's boom-boom band with the round white faced drum , pulling itself up the hillside by sheer faith . <p> White is the funeral colour here as there . Against the green of the trees , the black of their skins , the vibrant colours of their banners , it telescoped one loud clear report , " Hail Aunt Louise , " I could cry . Anna , I was seeing every corner of that scene . Being translated is like that . You can see from every angle . And I tell you . What a sight ! Like so many clean white birds nestling in a Portland thicket-parish beside mine , remember  --  shaded by the flowering mulatto companion tree . And the singing . Vox populi . I hear the voice , the gentle voice . Is the voice of God . That calls me home . <p> That voice calling me home truly did come in a whirlwind , Anna . Shepherd taking your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until every face is nothing but the vapour rising from your asphalt road on a hot wet day . Then only the voice , Suzie Anna , carrying you now in the chute , the voice with you now in the chute , keeping you company through the waters , over the rainbow 's mist , into seventh heaven and back to fete through days of dinkie mini , to see this thanksgiving and the nine-night to come and without a tired muscle . Back with every faculty  --  all hands , feet , eyes , ears a body could need for higher service . <p> Den ah who sey Sammy dead . <p> 2 . <p> Been sitting here and thinking Lowly girl , Lowly girl . Rocking and thinking Lowly girl . Been rocking and thinking of you Lowly girl and that rainbow in the mist . Them heavy black braids is gone Lowly girl . Thin schmuck now left , Lowly girl .

Do n't think I ca n't see you , St Peter 's mail man , message basket where a gold watch had been . <p>  --  Mammy King- <p> You here again Lowly and I had heard you that time . Back cross the sea to your bitty old island , how was I with only these hands , these feet and that fat head of hair , with Silas , two fading blooms , three units to set up , to do more , to find strength to sail cross the seas to see people like birds lowering a pine box into six feet of earth , and singing that song that you always sang whenever you braided my hair ? Huh ! . <p> Three times I did see me on that rainbow with you ... when I went to get water and fell into the water ... the fits never left me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ribbow and the master 's hands open to me . But not yet . Silas ' needs jerked me back . Donna Claire all but took me to you Lowly girl but Madam Marie 's prayers came between us that time . Then Silas came back from that Arkansas devilment with something fit to drive us all home . He left but I stayed , to help the kids make it and what are they now ? Dew swallowed by sun . Am sitting here rocking and thinking , this old red rag barely keeping these scattered dry brains from turning to raisins and I am thinking this young woman , is it you Lowly girl , come to usher me home for I 'm tired and lonely and want to come home . <p>  --  Mammy King , you over there ? You think you should be sitting in the sun with just that thin handkerchief on your head ? Sun will dry out your brains Mammy King and I need them . Hold on to me .

Suzie Anna , you liked to say . " Suzie-Anna , where you got that heavy engine hair from ? Reminds me of my grandmother . " " She pretty , " I would say , " Ai n't want no one favouring me less and if they be pretty . " <p>  --  I 'm putting this tube round your neck , ... remember we talked about that ? , ... so I can get into my black box here all that you have in that head you 're so determined to dry out in the sun . <p> Victrola , Lowly .

Did n't need to ask you to go back . Now take me with you . Tell me what you see , tell me what you hear and what you feel .  --  Same old Lowly . Reading face . What you used to say then ? " Your face my thane is as a book where men may read strange tales . " " What you talking ' bout little green island , " I would say . " Your face Miss Anna . You are nowhere here . You run away gone from this cold . Take me with you Miss Anna .

" That 's all you have to say Miss Anna ? One little laugh ? " " They ai n't teach you nothing at school little green chile ? I hardly get no schooling but if you ask me to count , I could make it to two and I did count two laughs , did n't I. " I would try to get you off of my case and on to anything else . " Get out of my face sunshine and mind the mistress ' plates . " But who could shut you up ? " Just like my granny I tell you , " you 'd go on . " Every little thing is the biggest of secrets .

Watch out , I 'm coming . " " Child , " I tell that funny-talking child , " they teach you much where you come from . You can sew real good , you talks real good and you cook , but ai n't nobody teach you to button your lip ? " I feared they might take my sunshine away and bury her in that kitchen downtown . Child do n't even know mens ! <p> Anna sighed another sigh that leaked from our history and the girl made a note to be sure to find some way of transposing those sighs and those laughs and other nonverbal expressions of emotions into the transcript she would submit to her masters .  --  And I 'd better do that indeed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself ,  --  Mammy will give me nothing else to add to these white people 's history of the blacks of South West Louisiana. - <p> Child hold on to that little sigh I sigh . " I know what you thinking Granny Anna . I can see it in your face : what 's up with that nosey Thomasina and the goings on in that room ? " T'was the one thing could calm you . Questions ' bout goings on in Silas ' room . Island baby saying quietly , " And you know what ? I 'm going to tell you all about it and soon . " What to do with that child ? That child and that room ? I have eye , mistress have eye . Messing with the lodger ? They bound to send that little green thing down to that no count kitchen .

One is a lady ; the other an island . They teach you about Perseus , Agamemnon , Clytemnestra , Perserpine , Daedalus , Andromeda , sounds that have no right sitting together , yet they fall off your tongue so easy like fresh water down a clean man 's back , like the satisfying goings on a good wife do n't mention and they did make my heart full . But Green Island , they tell you nothing ' bout a place called Louisiana right here in these united states of America . Who laughs last ... so Green Island jaw drop ; Green Island now quiet . Sea lashing stone gone still like a cemetery ; like the silence of the night when the Christ was born . <p> " You not from Louisiana , Miss Anna ?

" You not from Louisiana , St Mary , Miss Anna " " Cross my heart and hope to die . Born and bred there Mam . Mammy from there , Pappy from there . Go ask fearless Ramrod , waiting by the cotton tree . Go ask him , he 'll tell you , ' I pitch my tent , I make my nest , I hatch my seed . Ai n't going no place . Got ta swing me right here .

Ai n't nothing more make you quiet before save talk ' bout you in that Mister 's room . And I tell you again , green girl from Louisiana , St Mary , Jamaica , with much book-learning and little horse sense , you do n't know men , you do n't know mistresses . Do n't mess with the mistress ' boarders . She will send you right back to that convent you run from . " Talk ' bout the Mister and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's chest and send you sailing the skies for a safe place to land , but this was a silence in a class by itself . This was a boil gathering its parts to break loose . Green Island is a carbuncle oozing all over my skin . <p> " Miss Anna , you are my family . My mother was a Grant . Her grandfather a Grant . All Grants are my cousins . They all born and grow where I come from . " " Well ai n't that something ! Two places make babies . Which is the Mama and which is the Papa . Holy Father married them , Green Island ? " But it was passing strange and I 'd been studying the matter since the day that I found out . You do know that Lowly , and here is that woman come to mell me again . <p> Ah who sey Sammy dead .

Though you hardly can tell with it pressed out so straight . Whose bottom is threatening to unbalance whose legs like a train on a rickety track ? " " They did tell you at the convent , you tell me , just how ladies should walk . News caught me too late but I got by somehow . Still , who is this gal with some bits of me and some bits of you ?

Like you are ready to talk . Just let me take you out of the sun . Now , see this red button . It is pushed right down to record what you say . After about an hour , it will jump up with a ping . Do n't let it worry you . It just means that we will have used up one side of the spool . Just keep on talking while I turn it . And Mammy , what we want to know , to be truthful , what those people want to know , but as it happens , I want to know too , is what life was like for you , so go right back and tell me all about Louisiana ; tell me about leaving Louisiana ; why you chose Chicago ; how it was settling into Chicago and how and why you came back to settle here . Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young lady leans over and smiles her smile thinking that with that speech , her fine line black pen and with her red button depressed , she has loosed Anna 's threads and the ravelling would start . But that fabric is self-edge and on all of its sides .  --  Child who you be ?  --  Anna says as she flicks the first card from the pack , shuffled , cut and waiting on the imaginary board that joins their knees into a lay-away card table .  --  Me ? Yes . That 's a good question . You should want to know who is messing with your brains . I 'm studying , sort of , at Columbia  --  says the child searching her hand , arranging it into potential tricks , and those preliminaries done , thinking it did make sense to discard that one spade .  --  What you studying at child- Anna takes up that card .  --  Your children and grandchildren ... have you anybody studying ?  --  Good move , good move but it is Anna who smiles for that card is a seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its time . Yes child , what you studying at What you aiming to be ? - <p>  --  Oh Mammy , what am I studying Anthropology Mammy  --  The child draws from the pack . Nothing of note , so she throws out another card from her pitchy patch hand  --  And I 'm also a writer and that 's why they thought I 'd be good for this job .  --  And out goes another in the hope of something better from the adversary 's hand .  --  So shall we now pick through those brains and put what 's in them in my hungry black box .  --  But this is n't the whist her youngman had taught her . This is coon can and Anna with time on her hands , had mastered the skill in the longshoreman 's strike and had honed it to fine art on Chicago 's Southside . <p>  --  Where do you come from child ?  --  Anna trips in , distracting the girl .  --  You really do talk in two different ways . Ca n't figure it .  --  From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . Where before that .  --  Nowhere really Mammy  --  " Really . " Meaning what ?  --  My parents . They are from the islands .  --  Huh . Lots of them little bitty islands down there . And yours got no name .  --  Jamaica . Mammy  --  Yes . That is right . And that 's why you sounding so very much like her . Both of them girl ?  --  Yes Mammy- <p> Anna quickens her pace . She is totally in charge  --  I know that place from listening child . Now wherabouts your parents come from ? - <p> The child sees her opening , her chance to take over . To take it or not to take it . She knows Anna is building a suit made of clubs . If she plays Jack-seven-six , then Anna will know that she does n't have the queen , and already wise to the fact that she does n't have the King can throw her completely . This is thin ice and she 's never got further than lacing the skates . If she lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land of her parents , Anna might close up for she really is fixed , so she thinks , on dealing with that and where would go then the little exchange that had started to grow . The truth is deceitful ; it will out and embarrass you , so out comes :  --  Mammy this is going to sound like I 'm trying to shut you up but it is the truth . I left Jamaica when I was an infant . My parents had already migrated . They came back for me . They do n't say very much about the place that they came from- <p> Child could have saved herself planning and thinking for Anna continues to pull tricks from her sleeve .  --  Mighty strange child . That Lowly did talk so ! Then who you was with there ? You do n't keep in touch ?  --  My mothers ' mother but she died . That 's probably why they came to get me  --  They have high science there  --  Anna presses on again , hogging the game .  --  They did n't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't wait for an answer .  --  They rebellious folks , them Jamaican racemen . One feisty fighting lot , they seemed to me . They have brass bands but not as good as ours ; they have mento , flat-footed shuffle like ours ; they have pukkumina , that 's what they call getting the power ; they have tobacco and some sugar cane but no cotton . They have bananas in banana trees like windmills . " By and large , " that 's her word , your trees are not straight ; they tend to have branches sticking out of their sides and you can sit on them like on benches . You have green turtles too .  --  And Anna , my poor Anna , burst into song . <p> Green turtle sitting by a hole in the wall hole in the wall , hole in the wall Green turtle sitting by a hole in the wall looking at the deep blue sea . <p> Green turtle look so lonely , reminds me of me Guess he 's thinking ' bout his little girl turtle Sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my Bodinya in a long long time I know But I 'm sailing home Just as soon as the winds from the old West Indies blow . <p> She really did love that song so ! She awaits no applause . Just continues ;  --  And you have no winter . But you have plenty rain just like us here . And sometimes hurricanes . Lowly caught pneumonia in one of them . Held on for four years doing her part of the work but it took her straight home . Never felt the big quake . 1907 . That was big ! Bodies on top of bodies . She did n't actually see that but she did see the warner in full dress regalia for she had been in the market just the week before that . She did n't see the frogs jumping hop scotch in and out of the earth as it opened up now one crack , now the other . But she heard of it. - <p> My ancient mariner simmers to a close .  --  I would love to have been there to see all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . They had helped me with the reading . " I can write . I will write . " But you never did . Not in that way Lowly girl . Your handwriting is pretty , ai n't gainsaying that but your voice Lowly girl , could travel like lightning carrying pictures of the sun , of the rain , of the sound of the rain on the roof , of the one-sided grin of a neighbouring child . My ears can pick up a story ... how well you know that . Four years of pain and then you sailed out to happiness- <p> The recording machine goes " ping " and the girl is Hamlet again ; whether ' t is nobler to turn the tape over and to go on or just throw the towel in.  --  One whole side gone ,  --  she thought and not a thing to give to the white people . How would it look ? This woman they say has important data to give ; is important data ; she has seen things ; had done things ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lower class negro that they want to write . I was chosen to do her . It was an honour . Because of my colour , I could get her to talk . Because of my colour , she treats me like a daughter to whom she gives orders . Because of my colour , I have nothing from her but orders on this reel . What can I tell them ? How is this going to look ?  --  Without further ado , she bends over , manoevers her black box into its case , puts her arm through the strap , and it on her shoulder , takes her bag from the shoulder of the chair that she sat on , put that too on her shoulder , slaps her anger in neutral , for anger it is , and quietly says :  --  Venerable Sister . This is a bread and butter matter . My name and my job are at stake  --  and makes to step off with that , disrespectful of scientific procedure , of closing the interview neatly and leaving a lead for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit failure to them than to have them discover it . A null lead is still a lead and Anna you are seizing it . <p>  --  Little bread and butter and " them " is all you can think about ?  --  The thing is now personal and certainly unscholastic . Hear you now Anna :  --  " Man shall not live by bread alone . " Hear our girl now ;  --  " but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God , " first temptation , but ... Hear you again Anna before the child can finish her sentence :  --  Do n't say it child . Do n't say you are not the Christ .  --  Exasperated and defeated , how else to react but to limp away with what of one 's dignity that can be retrieved ! The child adjusts the strap on her shoulder and walks . It is you , Anna who reach out :  --  See you tomorrow  --  The child smiles . The baby is turning . You push , sensible Anna .  --  Machine 's mighty heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and stop puckering your brow . Jack Johnson my neighbour 's grandson is a fine young man . He 'll take it to you .  --  The little scientist is as happy as a lark . Our headwater is breaking . <p> 5 . <p>  --  Do you remember how it was for us Anna ?  --  More like a sheet of ice cracking in that Chicago kitchen . Then was when I knew for sure that all that Greek and Roman and fast and plenty talk was just one big fur coat lifted from them books for warmth . Girl child cold ! Ai n't lived through nothing like Chicago cold . Burn them mountain of books you done read and it ai n't amount to two minutes of warmth . Not one thing to hold on to !

You tackled that basin of dirty dishes and pans and when next you spoke I was just " Anna . " And then our good times rolled .  --  And they will roll again  --  Yes . Feisty enough . High spirited yet humble  --  Yes . She will do. - <p> 6 . <p> The kid overslept . How could she sleep so with that fat head of wire . Rushes , with that heavy machine at ready , to find you sitting in the sun , only this thin scarf on your head , just as she told you you should n't , hands on the arms of your chair trying to make for the rainbow , disregarding due process .

" " With , " " on , " " in , " they were all in there . Your puckered lips were her grandmother 's knees . And she thought ; withered muscles make a warm blanket that falls around you , caresses you , not pressing you like meatier thighs do . Soft , pliant and warm . Her granny , she remembered had had a little stool with a back made for her .

Almost sleeping , her head moves with the motions of grandmama 's hands and Granny locks her knees tighter to keep this precious parcel from slipping , from nodding too far back and hitting its head on the edge of the floor where her larger frame sits . Granny is wordless , leaving her space to wander over to grandfather 's tomb , to the bead flowers around it , to the huge kitchen near it , up with Granny 's pee , into the lata , into the oven , through the zally , carefully down that path past the waterhole , carefully , for that is wet stiff clay and you could slip , back under the tangerine tree to look over the side of the hill and on to the field full of bamboo sticks with light green yam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Mr Bonner , that poor peeny wally lives in his bottle .

Now and again , between changes of action , between the parting , the searching , the dipping of the finger , the massaging , the kid returns to watch her grandmother and then to fly away again and to feel Granny slowly shuffling off , patting her back and taking her to her cot . Some old ones never learn . For hardly has she deposited this precious bundle to her crib before it is up , standing , holding on to those firm bamboo legs , babyface between old knees and she must gather her up again , back to her chair , back to her seat on the floor and back to the plaiting of the hair .

Strong-willed girl , she had stopped in night by pushing herself into the present and had missed the chance of knowing that the time was here when we would keep her afloat with our knees . <p> Our girl last evening walked home with you Anna but only part way . A olden boy came to take her to Chimboraza , Cotapaxi and Pococataptl as well .

Self-esteem needs a triumph a day and Anna she could n't really pat herself on the back for making an old lady reel out her life story , so she earned herself credits by getting a bath and a douche in the wooden wash basin of the labourer 's cabin the programme director felt would put her in the informant 's environment and help her to formulate the right kind of questions . <p> The beautiful lady inside and out , preparing her beautiful hearth for her beautiful lover , changes and powders the sheets .

So with infinite care so that no onion or escallion or garlic could sully , she transfers the seasoned chicken to an iron pot , covers it up and sees it to a slow fire . No need to hurry : seasoning could slowly and decidedly enter meat to make a succulent meal for her Reuben . The hurry would have to be , come tomorrow when she 'd have to get to you Anna , her flirtatious old lady , get back home to deposit her things and be off with her to Franklin to collect her Prince Charming . There would be little time to freshen up so what was done tonight had to be done well to last into tomorrow . <p> The effort was somnambulistic . The kid overslept and rushes here to find you like this . " Mammy just died " and out come the if 's . " If only I had n't overslept ; if I had had my priorities right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just tell the white people the old lady has died . " You frightened her deep down this time . Have the child thinking she 's spoken aloud , for your lips are n't moving . It could n't be the health worker , the poor child is thinking for she does n't know her problem and in any case , Forbes is only now bustling down the steps in her usual delayed sympathetic way , worrying about the trials of the world and asking her would she babysit you while she goes off for the doctor and for the manpower to get you to bed . " Lived past her time , " Forbes says for the nth time . " Going off every other day . Wo n't let it go , yet telling her friend just as often , ' I want to come over the rainbow 's mist ! ' " Dear Forbes would n't know . Any day now . The head has presented . <p> Ah who sey Sammy dead <p> The child knows they are not her words for they are nowhere in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and that your lips have n't moved . With so many years of formal schooling , she can not think " ghost . " Ventriloquist , she thinks . " Can the old flirt , " that 's you Anna , " have this too in her past ? " Anna when will you stop teasing ! At death 's door as in life ?  --  Them teachers did teach you nothing ' bout living ; they teach this one nothing ' bout dying or passing the lifeline . Ai n't know what she did  --  She knows that she heard that . Not just thought she heard that . <p> Ah who sey Sammy dead . <p> There is no question about it ; it is as clear as a bell . Somebody spoke . A voice very familiar and it is n't her Mammy 's . The ears are hearing other frequencies . The child has come through . Anna , she 'll make it . <p>
