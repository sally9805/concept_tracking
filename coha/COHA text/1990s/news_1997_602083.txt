<p> Jerry Reinsdorf , controversial owner of baseball 's Chicago White Sox and the NBA champion Chicago Bulls , sounds off in a rare , in-depth interview with USA TODAY 's Bill Meyers . <p> What about Michael Jordan 's next contract ? Is Dennis Rodman coming back ? Has Reinsdorf given up on the White Sox this season ? And will Scottie Pippen and Albert Belle stay in the Windy City ? <p> Read on . Reinsdorf has the last word . <p> You just traded three White Sox pitchers to the Giants for six minor leaguers . Do you have any regrets ? <p> I do n't have any regrets about the trade . If there 's anything to regret , I regret the way its been portrayed by the media . Because the trade was not made because we we 're giving up on the season . The trade was made because we felt in the long run it would help make us a better ball club . And in the short run , we did n't think we we 're weakening ourselves . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't suffered at all from the trade . We 're three games out . Every save opportunity we 've had has been converted . We 're playing about the same as we were before the trade , which really was n't very good . But that 's because we have n't been hitting . <p> What I like about the trade is that there 's very little pitching in baseball today . Pitching will be even thinner next year with the expansion teams . Its going to be almost impossible to trade for pitching in the future because people are n't going to want to give up pitchers . It will be very difficult to sign free-agent pitchers because their price is going to be very high . And what we did was get four good young arms to go along with other arms we have . <p> Our philosophy is that we want to stockpile young arms in the system because we think that 's what 's going to get us over the top in the future . <p> What about the free-agent factor in the deal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign either ( Wilson ) Alvarez or Roberto Hernandez . Alvarez 's agent told me they had no interest in signing . In Roberto 's case , they were looking for a multiyear contract of four years or more . He 's going to be 33 after the seasons over . It was n't a particularly good risk . <p> Therefore , it made sense to trade these guys when we could get real value for them . We did n't give them away . We got six prospects back . I do n't know if they 're any good or not , but our scouts love them . Our scouts believe all six of these guys will play in the big leagues and that three of them have a good chance to be all-stars . <p> Before the trade , you were quoted as saying Anyone who thinks this White Sox team will catch Cleveland is crazy . How do you know when its time to pull the plug on a season ? <p> Its unfortunate that the comment I made about not thinking we were going to win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other . <p> I should not have made ( the comment ) because there 's no way it could have looked good in print . <p> What I was trying to say was that as a fan watching the White Sox , if they keep playing the way they 're playing , there 's no way they 'll beat Cleveland . And that is true . If we 're going to beat Cleveland , we 're going to have to play better . <p> We think the fans were sending us a message that they did n't like this team . And the fact is , they were right . We had the third or fourth highest payroll in baseball , and we were n't performing to the level of that compensation . <p> Do you think your $ 55 million signing of Albert Belle significantly changed baseballs economics ? <p> When the matter of Albert Belle came up , I had to first consider if I would be doing any harm to baseball by signing him for what was then going to be a record salary . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to satisfy myself that he was going to get the money anyway from somebody . <p> I have an obligation to my fans to compete under the system in place , and while that system may give us an advantage over a Kansas City or a Pittsburgh , I have no right to voluntarily give up that advantage . <p> And if you look at the teams that were in the postseason in 1996 , you 'll find that the highest payroll team beat the second highest payroll team in the World Series and that the four teams that were in the League Championship Series were all in the top five in payroll . <p> If you have a high payroll , you 're not guaranteed that you 're going to win . But if you do n't have a high payroll , you 're guaranteed not to win . <p> Will there be more White Sox trades this season ? Are either Albert Belle or Robin Ventura on the block ? <p> I cant speculate on what the future will bring . But there 's no question that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trading Albert Belle or Robin Ventura . We were approached , and Schueler rebuffed the approaches . <p> But what about trading Belle or Ventura ? <p> I have no idea . I hope not . But it all depends on what value we get back . The only untouchable on this club is Frank Thomas . But its going to be very , very hard for somebody to give us what we would have to have to trade Robin Ventura or Albert Belle . <p> The baseball strike ended in 1995 . Are you happy with the collective bargaining agreement with the players ? <p> I thought the collective bargaining agreement failed to solve the problems of the game and that 's why I voted against it . I believe that there is a tremendous gap between the small revenue and large revenue teams that 's going to prevent small revenue teams from being competitive over the years . But it is the collective bargaining agreement and its the only one we have and I have to live with it . <p> Is baseball still sick ? <p> The fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball to return to the level that it was at , there has to be a better relationship between the union and the clubs . We have to work more closely to show the fans that they are the true owners of the game . <p> How do you do that ? <p> By not fighting so much among ourselves . By focusing on the game rather than on the money part of it . By making the game more interesting . Being more responsive to what fans want . <p> What is your position on baseballs proposed radical realignment ? <p> I think it makes sense . But it really does n't matter what I think . The most important thing is what do the fans want ? ( Baseballs ) done extensive polling and the polls show that the fans really want this . I think it was like 75-80% of the fans are strongly in favor of this realignment and indicated that they would go to more games . <p> Should Bud Selig become the permanent commissioner of baseball ? <p> We have a search committee under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates very , very soon , and that we should be able to get a permanent commissioner hired certainly by the end of the year . ( Bud 's ) told me he would n't take the job . So there 's no point in my even thinking about whether he should or should n't . <p> I know everyone 's been on vacation this summer , but how close are you to signing Michael Jordan ? <p> We have n't even begun discussions yet . We 'll get to it sometime reasonably soon . <p> Is a two-year deal possible ? <p> Anything 's possible , but I think its probably best for both of us to leave our options open and to go one year at a time . Michael has made it clear , he 's not going to play for anyone else . He 'll either play for us or retire . <p> Why one year ? <p> We are getting near the end of the line for this dynasty and for this incredible athletes career . He does n't want to play when he 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ championship team . And on our side , when we 're no longer a championship team , we have to think about the future . That 's one of the hard things about running a team , you have to look at both the present and the future . All championship runs come to an end at some point . You do n't want to cut one off prematurely , but at the same time , if you do n't think about the future , you could put yourself into a prolonged period of non-competitiveness . <p> What is your current thinking about Scottie Pippen ? <p> Scottie 's been a great player for the Bulls and he 's done everything that anybody ever could have asked him . I have a great deal of respect for Scottie both professionally and personally . But the primary obligation is to our fans , and our obligation to our fans is to put the best possible team out there that we can . Which means that players come and players go . <p> What factors do you take into account when you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stock or bond ? <p> When you decide whether to sell a stock , you do n't consider the past . You do n't consider the fact that its gone up or its gone down . What you have to consider is what is the future for that stock . And that 's the same thing with a ballplayer . <p> In Scotties case , this year , as in every year for all of our players , we took a look at what the market was and we concluded that we could not make ourselves a better club by trading Scottie . So we kept Scottie . <p> Is Dennis Rodman part of the plan for next season ? <p> If we 're going to keep the team together and I 'm assuming we are going to sign Michael then ( coach ) Phil Jackson and ( general manager ) Jerry Krause have both said they 'd like to have Dennis Rodman back . It just basically becomes a basketball judgment . If , for some reason , Michael does n't come back , then there 's no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Michael wo n't be back ? <p> No . But anything is possible . I fully expect that Michael will be back . But on September 29 , 1993 , I thought Michael Jordan was going to be playing for the Chicago Bulls in the upcoming season . On September 30 , I found out that he was n't going to be . So anything 's possible . <p> Does it bother you that a superstar like Michael Jordan makes demands about how the Bulls are run and who is on the roster ? <p> I 've always talked to Michael about the organization , about things that we were thinking about , to get his opinion . I thought it was inappropriate ( after last season ) for Michael to express himself publicly and frequently on what his desires were . It annoyed me . But the level of annoyance was n't anything significant and the fact is Michael and I have been together 12 years , and its probably the second time that Michael annoyed me in 12 years . So it could hardly rupture a relationship of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other far more than Michael and I get annoyed . <p> Many people say that you have replaced George Steinbrenner as the most controversial sports owner . What 's your reaction ? <p> I think George 's controversy is over issues that are different than what I 'm controversial about .
