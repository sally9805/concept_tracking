<p> A year ago this week , Mayor Willie Brown dropped a City Hall bombshell . He fired Municipal Railway chief Phil Adams and replaced him with Emilio Cruz , his own chief of staff . <p> Cruz , who was 31 , had no transit experience . He would learn the job by starting at the top of the city 's most visible service  --  685,000 passengers a day and a budget of $ 307 million . <p> Brown gave Cruz simple marching orders . " He wants the whole system cleaned up , " Cruz said . <p> After a year , the results are mixed . Cruz gives the Muni a C-plus , up from a C-minus when he took over . Most of the problems he inherited are still there , he acknowledged the other day , but he says the system is slowly turning around . <p> According to Cruz , there 's light at the end of Muni 's tunnel : major improvements in service coupled with new buses and rail cars . There also may be a fare increase in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many riders are not so sanguine . <p> " It could n't have gotten any worse , " said Kevin Fatton , who rides the J-Church streetcar line . The J line is partially equipped with new Breda cars , designed in Italy and assembled here . At $ 2 million each , they are the most expensive street railway cars ever built . <p> When a couple of them broke down the other day , Fatton said , the situation forced passengers in the following car to get out and walk , " like a flood of refugees . " <p> " They have to figure out a few things , like rush hour , " he said . " The Muni ? Better ? Hah ! " <p> It 's not just the Muni , said Andrew Sullivan , who helped found a citizens group called Rescue Muni . It 's the system . And the system , he says , " is badly broken . " <p> Sullivan likes Cruz , especially for his openness . <p> But Cruz is like the man who took the job nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , according to Jim Chappell , president of SPUR , a San Francisco urban planning group of concerned citizens . The manager is n't allowed to manage , he says . <p> The service level is set by the Transportation Commission , the supervisors set the fares , the Civil Service Commission provides the employees and makes the rules and the mayor sets the budget . There is no guaranteed funding , so the Muni ends up with whatever is left over after the police and fire and every other major service gets its share of the general fund . <p> There also are powerful unions and meddling politicians . " Everybody in the transit industry knows about this setup , and they wo n't touch it , " Chappell said . For that reason , San Francisco ca n't attract top transit management ; before Cruz , there were four top Muni managers in 10 years , and three were fired . <p> The people at the top are easier to get rid of than any of the Muni 's 3,500 employees who serve the public . Cruz points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . However , when he tried to make an example of a driver who let her bus get loose and hit a building , drivers threatened a wildcat strike and he had to publicly back down . <p> " I do n't think anybody can be successful in this job as it is set up , " said Chappell . <p> Nonetheless , Cruz is trying . In the year since he took over , he says , ridership is up 4 percent after years of decline . The mayor 's budget for the Muni will increase by $ 19 million for the next fiscal year . Cruz will put the money into improving the personnel department and putting more mechanics in the shops and more drivers on the street . <p> He is getting more equipment . " Our equipment is very old and decrepit , " he said . Most of the trolley bus fleet , he said , is 16 to 17 years old ; the Boeing rail cars , which were badly designed to begin with , are 17 years old . <p> NEW EQUIPMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within two years and , Cruz hopes , 69 new Italian rail cars . He also wants 180 new diesel buses . There are also plans  --  but no money  --  to extend rail service out Third Street to the Bayview- Hunters Point neighborhood and to extend a subway into Chinatown . <p> By the end of this year , Cruz claims , the city and a contractor will be able to redesign the signaling system that controls the cars in the Muni Metro subway under Market Street . <p> When and if that happens , service will improve significantly on the Muni Metro , a system that moves 125,000 passengers daily on five lines . It would also enable the Muni to use tracks built along the Embarcadero a year ago to the CalTrain depot . " Rail-to-rail service , " says Cruz . <p> Cruz also sees a fare increase in the indefinite future . He wo n't be specific . He says he has no firm proposal . But every politician is aware that fare increases are often political dynamite in San Francisco , especially when the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our fares are 25 percent lower than the lowest in the country , " said Cruz . " You know that expression , ' You get what you pay for ' ? " RIDERS FEEL SHORTCHANGED <p> The riders often feel they do n't get what they are paying for , an outlook that has become an unchallenged community belief . They see the Muni as an endless problem , one of the problems of life in the city . <p> Among the problems are equipment failures , service failures and overcrowding . The 38-Geary and 30-Stockton bus lines are famous for packed buses , as crowded as the Tokyo subway and twice as slow . <p> San Francisco 's own subway has been troublesome since the day it opened 17 years ago . It gets better one day and worse the next . Long delays are routine . So is slow and inconsistent service . <p> Many Muni veterans have given up on the subway and think the city should junk its project to change the subway signal system , which has cost over $ 30 million so far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one area to another , change for the sake of change . <p> Ken Neimi , a Muni watcher and a member of Rescue Muni , sees some good things . Under Cruz , the drivers now call out stops . There is less graffiti on the buses . On the other hand , service on the 42 , 47 and 49 lines on Van Ness Avenue has gotten worse , he said . The buses get stacked up in bunches . There are long delays with no buses , followed by three buses in a row . <p> " I 've just given up on those , " Neimi said . But these buses all stop in front of the temporary City Hall , where the mayor , the Transportation Commission and the supervisors all have offices . <p> MIXED REVIEWS <p> Inside the Muni , some see Cruz as a breath of fresh air , but many others see him as a breath of hot air . Middle managers and Muni veterans are willing to talk , but only on condition they not be identified . Some say Cruz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on discipline and speeding up the bureaucracy so there are more drivers on the street and support personnel to keep them there . <p> " He 's good , " said one . " We 're doing better . I 'd give us a good grade , maybe a B. " <p> Still others think Cruz is a political creature who knows very little about the actual operation of the system and attempts to explain things he does n't understand . <p> " You ever talk to him about how this place really runs ? " said one manager . " He does n't know what he is talking about . " <p> " Cruz ? " said another , " He 's just another big shot from Muni headquarters . They never show up unless there are TV cameras or politicians around . " <p> The reviews are mixed , except where it counts most . P.J. Johnston , Brown 's press aide , says the mayor continues to have confidence in Cruz . " The mayor sent him to do one of the toughest jobs in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turning the Muni around , " he said . <p> ABOUT THE SERIES <p> Today 's " Commuter Chronicles " continues a weekly series of stories exploring the practical aspects of transportation and commuting in the Bay Area .
