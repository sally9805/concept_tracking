Section : Business &; technology Money Game Isiah Thomas jumps into the big business of basketball and still hits nothing but net <p> Impatient reporters and TV crews have been hanging out in the back room of Wayne Gretzky 's sports restaurant and bar for about 30 minutes , ready to cover the biggest sports story of the day in hockey-mad Toronto . The man they are waiting for , however , has nothing to do with the beloved Maple Leafs  --  or speed skating or broom-sweeping curling  --  yet he has quickly become sports celebrity No. 1 in Canada 's largest city . When Isiah Thomas finally arrives , the normally jaded media crowd buzzes with star-struck excitement as the former basketball great , now executive vice president and part owner of the National Basketball Association 's Toronto Raptors , makes his way to the microphone . <p> Thomas has brought along a younger version of himself , a 22-year-old point guard named Damon Stoudamire , the Raptors ' initial draft pick and the man Thomas plans to build his first-year expansion team around . Stoudamire is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and everyone wants to know why Thomas is going to load his ball club on the back of a 5-foot , 10-inch player in this game dominated by 7-footers . Heart and competitiveness matter , Thomas explains , and this guy has them . Stoudamire also now has more money than he could ever have imagined . " Welcome to the millionaires ' club , " Thomas says , extending his handto basketball 's next generation . <p> Advice . If Stoudamire wants advice on how to play the game , he need look no further than his boss . About 6 feet tall , Thomas was the rare small player who dominated his sport , winning two championships in his career with the Detroit Pistons and playing in 12 all-star games in 13 seasons . But if Stoudamire wants advice on how to invest his newfound fortune , he can look to the man who signed him to his first pro contract as well . For Thomas , whose family once lived in an abandoned building on Chicago 's tough West Side , is living out a real-life hoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as well publicized as his basketball exploits , is perhaps more impressive than his machine-gun dribbling and his rainbows from the three-point line . Through shrewd management of the millions he made playing basketball , the 34-year-old ex-Piston has managed to make a smooth transition from player to part owner of an NBA franchise . <p> New breed . As the NBA continues to expand , Thomas , a new breed of sports executive , will be in a position to manage rapid growth . Basketball is one of America 's most popular sports . Some 47 million people played the game last year , more than any other team sport , and consumers bought nearly $2 billion worth of basketball shoes in 1994 . With over $1 billion in gross revenues , the NBA has seen sales of its licensed retail products quadruple in the past five years , to $3 billion . Meanwhile , the league 's average annual player salary has more than doubled in the same time period , to about $2 million . And by deftly avoiding the labor strife that has hurt pro baseball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently plaguing pro football  --  the NBA is moving into the next century as perhaps the strongest and most credible sports league . <p> To keep its winning streak alive , the NBA is going global . It has sponsored Olympic " dream teams " and brought in international stars from Europe in order to compete with soccer as a world favorite . The league hopes that this international accent will lead to lucrative new TV contracts in Europe , Asia and Latin America . At the heart of this strategy is the opening of the untapped Canadian market , where the Raptors and the Vancouver Grizzlies have just begun operation . <p> Looking out from his high-rise office at the bottom of Bay Street near the heart of Toronto 's financial district , Thomas realizes that his job puts him in the unique position of developing an exciting new business in a market of 4 million people . As the corporate headquarters for many of Canada 's largest corporations  --  and as the center of the country 's entertainment and media conglomerates  --  Toronto is a perfect venue for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basketball court , of bringing in a host of corporate sponsors and of filling front-row seats with celebrities  --  much as the Los Angeles Lakers have done . " You can no longer isolate what happens on the court itself from the business side of this sport , " explains Thomas . " Everything has to work together . The players ' contracts have to be done in a sound financial way . The corporate sponsors have to buy into your vision . You have to create a brand identity the same way IBM or McDonald 's does . The difficulty is that none of this works unless you win . That 's the key . " <p> A block from Thomas 's office , construction is starting on the new 22,500-seat Air Canada Centre , a $200 million complex that will include an office tower . The project is being privately financed by the Raptors ' ownership group . The new arena will be completed by 1997 , with 124 luxury boxes . Toronto fans have spent $30 million on permanent seat licenses for 15,000 season tickets . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already captivated Canada 's business community . Air Canada paid $15 million to affix its name to the new facility , and it will pay $1.5 million annually over the next two decades for promotional rights ; Ford Canada is paying the Raptors $3.5 million per year to be associated with the team ; and companies such as Coca-Cola , Nike , Labatt 's and Molson breweries , Bell Canada , Xerox , Sears and AST Computer have also agreed to promotional partnerships . <p> Investor . Toronto businessman John Bitove Jr. , whose family fortune came from the food concession business , is one of the lead investors of the group that paid $125 million for the Raptors . Thomas has a 4.5 percent stake in the team and an option to purchase an additional 4.5 percent at a later date . The 35-year-old Bitove 's selection of Thomas as the Raptors ' general manager was initially viewed with skepticism . Thomas could n't possibly have the experience or the skills necessary to run a pro basketball team , argued critics , who wondered if the hiring was just an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . " It almost cost Thomas a job , " Bitove recalls . " The worry we had is that people would think it was just a gimmick . But the more we talked to Thomas , the more we realized that he understood the business better than anyone else and would be the innovator we needed to take this thing to the top . " <p> The perception that he was hired as a front man bothers Thomas somewhat , but he is n't overly concerned . " What people have to realize is that I 've worked very hard for everything I 've accomplished , " he says . " I 've played basketball and studied the game since I was a little kid . I 've educated myself to learn about business and finance . I 've worked hard . Nothing came easy . " <p> It was never easy for the Thomas family . The youngest of nine children , Thomas saw his father leave home early in the game . As a result , the Thomas clan struggled , moving from apartment to apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers were involved in drugs , street hustling and pimping . The Vice Lords gang was the leading power in the streets , but Thomas never joined up , in part because his brothers , who occasionally ran with the pack , would n't let him . Thomas started making baskets when he was 3 , old-timers in Chicago will tell you , and he was always extremely bright , although a bit mischievous . He used to sneak in the back door of a little food stand called the Snack Shop and steal pancakes to eat on his way to school . When he was 12 years old , a player got shot on a neighborhood basketball court when an argument broke out over who had the next game . <p> Family matters . Thomas 's mother , Mary , never gave up and held the family together by sheer will . A devout Roman Catholic , she worked at Our Lady of Sorrows church to help pay for her kids ' Catholic education . Mary Thomas remembers being castigated by state welfare workers because she used part of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes thought , Why me ? ' " she recounts . " We were so poor , and you ca n't help but wonder if your kids are going to be that way all of your life . All I could do was keep praying . " <p> Thomas starred at St. Joseph High School in suburban Westchester , the school featured prominently in theacclaimed documentary Hoop Dreams . Then he became a standout for Bobby Knight 's national champions at Indiana University . He had promised his mother he would graduate from college before playing pro ball , but he changed his mind in his sophomore year . " We were playing in a tournament in Hawaii before Christmas break , " explains Thomas , " and when I came home for the holidays , I came home to a house where the phone was shut off , no lights , no heat . My mother had just had a heart attack . I had three brothers who were strung out on coke , heroin and alcohol . I had nieces and nephews who had no chance of ever seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living outside of what we would generally call society , and I had to bring them back . " <p> Thomas 's first contract with the Pistons bought his mother a house next to a golf course in suburban Chicago . Over the next four years , he earned a degree in criminal justice in the off-season . " At the time , " says Thomas , " I wanted to be a lawyer because I thought that the platform for social change would come through law and politics . Once I got to the NBA , I could see that the celebrity aspect gave you instant credibility . And I could see that the platform for real change was in the business world . " <p> It was n't until he felt he knew about economics and finance that Thomas decided to diversify beyond stocks and bonds . But his upbringing made him a very conservative , low-risk investor . " I had never had a checkbook before , and then you get to the NBA , and you 're given a portfolio worth millions of dollars , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was very scary . But being from the streets , I did n't trust people very easily . Still do n't . Just because a guy wears a suit and tie and speaks eloquently does n't mean he 's not trying to get in your pocket and take your money . " <p> Thomas employed a group of advisers  --  accountants , lawyers , bankers and his wife , Lynn  --  to counsel him on investments . Like a true point guard , he involved his entire financial team , but he always made the final decisions on where his money was going . He also used his superstar status to great advantage . " Being a celebrity creates a natural deal flow , " observes Thomas . " The deals come to you , and you get a real opportunity to become an investment banker . " <p> Assets . Thomas 's caution paid off . He is the majority owner of StarShowz International , an event-planning company that puts on 7,000 events a year . He also owns part of American Speedy Printing , a chain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and may eventually take public . <p> For now , Thomas is concentrating on his core business  --  the Raptors . The six years he spent as president of the NBA players ' union has given him a unique grasp of the league 's complicated salary cap system . Understanding the financial nuances of the cap should enable Thomas to deftly juggle the Raptors ' roster so that he can field a competitive mix of rookies and free agents in the coming years . Thomas , says NBA Commissioner David Stern , " understands uniquely how the players and the league both benefit from each other if they grow the pie together . " <p> The pie certainly seems to be growing in Toronto . The Raptors , who have won five of their first 15 contests , are averaging more than 21,000 fans a game in their temporary SkyDome home , and their merchandise sales are soaring . On the court , Stoudamire , sporting a Mighty Mouse tattoo on his right bicep , is making Thomas look real good by averaging more than 16 points and eight assists per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role model status and wants to set an example outside the arena , too . From Chicago to Toronto , it 's been a hard drive to the top for this little big man . And his winning plays today are all about the dollars and cents that can create jobs , wealth and opportunity . Although he 's moved from the basketball court to the boardroom , Isiah Thomas is still hitting nothing but net . Winning streak <p> The NBA is soaring today , and players and owners are benefiting big-time .

Some of the best-known names in sports  --  Magic Johnson , Julius Erving and Walter Payton , for example  --  have parlayed the fame and money they earned during their playing days into successful business ventures .

Dr. J perfected the NBA 's above-the-rim game and now flies high with interests in the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. , a TV station and a sports and entertainment management firm . Payton , an ex-Chicago Bear , is part owner of a bank , restaurants and an Indy-car-race team . <p> Athletic strength does n't always translate into financial muscle , however .

Says Matthew Rizik of Coopers &; Lybrand : " If a bunch of NBA players pooled their money and just invested in Treasury bills , they could buy a Fortune 500 company when they retired . " The Portland Trail Blazers ' Buck Williams , president of the NBA 's players ' union , adds that players must get educated about finance while still playing . " If you can learn all the words to a rap song , " declares Williams , " you can certainly learn the basics of tax laws and how to invest in a mutual fund . " <p> Stakes . Like Thomas , many pro athletes want to become players in the business they know best : sports . Johnson bought a stake in the Los Angeles Lakers . Former Kansas City Chief Deron Cherry invested money earned from a beverage distributorship in the National Football League 's Jacksonville Jaguars . And Payton and another former running back , Calvin Hill , are leading separate investor groups that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how lucrative pro franchises can be .

Setting up a financial empire <p> Dan McGraw <p> Sports agents DAVID FALK : AN OFFENSIVE THREAT FOR NBA PLAYERS <p> This summer 's collective-bargaining agreement was supposed to create good feelings between NBA players and owners . But the Charlotte Hornets quickly learned about the new state of labor relations in the league . This fall , contract extension talks with the team 's center , Alonzo Mourning , broke down . Charlotte offered the all-star $11.2 million a year , but Mourning 's agent , David Falk , maintained that Mourning was worth at least $13 million a season . The prospect of losing Mourning to free agency without getting any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Miami Heat . <p> Charlotte wo n't be the last team to experience the " Falk factor . " Although there are about 300 licensed NBA agents , Falk 's obdurate advocacy on behalf of his clients stands out.As a result , his firm , Falk Associates Management Enterprises , represents many of the NBA 's top players , including Michael Jordan and Patrick Ewing . <p> Falk 's visibility increased earlier this year , when he and his major clients criticized the NBA labor talks and tried to decertify the players ' union . The conflict almost shut down the league . In the end , the majority of players voted for the contract , one of Falk 's rare defeats . The agent still insists the deal is a bad bargain  --  not for the great players but for the NBA 's role players . " Under any system , the superstars will get paid , " explains Falk . " Yet salaries will become polarized , and it 's not in the interest of the middle class of players . " <p> The cap . The NBA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1994 , the league 's top draft pick , Milwaukee 's Glenn Robinson , received a 10-year , $68 million contract . This year 's initial pick , Golden State 's Joe Smith , received a cap-mandated three-year , $8.5 million deal . Falk insists he is n't worried , but the cap does take away an agent 's early payoff if a player lacks longevity . <p> Few agents pursue endorsements for their clients as relentlessly as Falk . Jokes Dennis Scott of the Orlando Magic : " I have to tell David to stop calling me . " But some of Falk 's ex-clients are no longer so chummy with him . Former player Adrian Dantley has filed a lawsuit against Falk and his former colleagues . The suit alleges that poor financial advice caused Dantley to lose $1.5 million . Falk denies the charges . <p> One of Falk 's next assignments will be negotiating a new contract for Jordan . When the agent worked out Jordan 's last deal in 1988 with the Chicago Bulls , the player received an annual salary of more than $3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . But escalating contracts soon made these numbers look small . Jordan 's deal expires next summer , and Falk will seek very big dollars . " The greatest player in the history of the game , who has been underpaid for the last six years , " declares the agent , " should be the highest-paid player in the game . " Sounds like the Bulls will be confronting the " Falk factor " again . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Power team . Falk with client Michael Jordan <p> Warren Cohen <p>
