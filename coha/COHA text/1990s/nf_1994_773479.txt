Well , that 's exactly what happened , but it did n't change the fact that , you know , I did n't hurt him and he was a very capable , tough little boy ! ' Dick Miyagawa also had high regard for Basil Miragliotta 's skill in the ring . Considering his best intercollegiate effort to have been against the Virginian in the 1947 NCAA semifinals , Miyagawa has contended that he , like Hawthorne , learned from an earlier bout with Miragliotta : I noticed that when I was fighting him southpaw , he got mixed up , so the next fight with him , and that was in the tournament , I fought him in all three rounds left-handed and he did n't know what to do ! " The man who had convinced Miyagawa of the shock and surprise value of switching from orthodox to southpaw was DeWitt Portal , the innovator at San Jose State who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Navy , with part of that service taking place when he was in charge of some Navy programs at the University of Wisconsin and also coached Badger boxers . Miyagawa was coached by both Portal and John Walsh and has maintained that the former was the best teacher he ever had and the latter the best second . Walsh , Miyagawa has stressed , was very shrewd in the corner between rounds . He never said anything until a boxer was ready to go out in the ring . At that point he gave precise instructions as to what the boxer should do , and the boxer remembered because it was the last word he was given . Miyagawa has argued that the between-rounds period is a hectic time and that many instructions presented at the beginning of that rest period are lost in confusion . Walsh 's calmness throughout this period and attempts to get a boxer to relax and catch his breath topped off with clear , confident , and concise instructions at the very end of that rest period made Walsh the winner that he was.30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a commanding calmness as he stepped through the ropes , but inside there was a nervous churning , and before his bouts he tried to hide in the most absolute seclusion he could find . But once his mouthpiece was in place it was a different matter . He moved with the confidence and precision of a scientist who knew his subject of inquiry and had the methods and techniques at hand to solve the problems he was undertaking . His receding hairline , studious aura , and precise application of boxing principles called forth comparison with the prowess and personality of Chuck Davey . Hawthorne had the highest respect // for Davey 's ability and said , I can remember nearly every punch he threw in the college ring . I saw him twice in dual meet competition against Penn State boys , then at least five perhaps six , times in national tournaments . He was the best I ever saw.31 Hawthorne , who flew P-47s in the Army Air Corps in World War II , wanted a college teaching career and entered graduate school at Penn State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200 per month he received as an instructor in 1948-1949 did not go very far in supporting a wife and child and another child on the way . Therefore , he abandoned the pursuit of a Ph.D . in agricultural economics and a professorial career and went into the limestone business . In 1954 he became an owner of a limestone company in Butler , Pennsylvania , which was involved in quarrying limestone and heating it in a kiln to drive carbon dioxide off the calcium carbonate and form calcium oxide . The calcium oxide was then sold as a chemical to steel mills , fertilizer factories , water purification operations , and acid treating facilities . He expanded the operations of the company to such an extent that his responsibilities required him to fly his own plane from Pennsylvania to Kansas and to practically all parts of the United States . The hectic pace his leadership and management activities required eventually led Hawthorne to the conclusion that there must be more to life than all that stress , and he sold the business . Because he had been involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that work , he entered the insurance and financial planning business and became a Certified Life Underwriter , financial planner , and a highly successful registered representative of The Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States 3z Hawthorne has expressed the belief that boxing probably will never return to the college campus as the major sport that it was in his collegiate days , but he has said that he owes much to his participation in the sport and thinks many people make the mistake of equating it to its professional counterpart . He has stated , I absolutely believe there was not an ounce of any of the  --  I do n't know what you 'd call it  --  crookedness , viciousness , maliciousness of professional boxing that ever permeated college boxing . I think college boxing was carried on in a manner that was absolutely top quality . Finesse and so forth was emphasized . Leo Houck for home matches used to have himself and all of the boxing managers in tuxedos . Now I do n't know if clothes make the man . In fact I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure of another thing . It was an attempt to say we are n't pugs and this is a sport . If there is anything that absolutely destroys me , and it 's almost like discussing politics , it is when people start talking about college boxing being brutal and so forth . How close do you ever sit to a football game ? Those kids are out there with more intent to hurt somebody , for God 's sake ! , than any of us ever was in boxing ! Ninety-nine and 44/100 percent of the time contestants became friends , and when a bout was over they were thrilled at what the other guy was able to do  --  " Well , you really erased me with that left hook ! " or " I walked into that one ! " or something like that.33 One of Hawthorn 's favorite quotations is from Gene Tunney , and it seems to represent a fitting summary of the proud sense of accomplishment the Nittany Lion champion felt about his boxing achievements : If there 's any extreme form of individualism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all by yourself . No partners , no comrades in there with you . Like dying you fight alone . So consider the prizefighter as a spiritual individualist , a solitary soul in travail . ' The travail in the ring during the 1947 final bout at 135 pounds was experienced mostly by Bob Humphries . Chuck Davey had little trouble in beating the Wisconsin representative , who was a World War II Marine veteran of combat on Iwo Jima , where he had lost part of his leg . He did not have the speed to keep up with Davey as the Spartan put on another demonstration of the skill that made him the best in college boxing . Davey was awarded a unanimous decision and the John S. LaRowe Trophy , to the surprise of hardly anyone . " Another fine exhibition of boxing occurred when the veteran Lutz edged Bob Anderson of San Jose State at 145 pounds . The Badger won his third national title , scoring mostly from the outside while his Spartan opponent was most effective in close . The first round was won by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be even . An injury to Lutz 's nose , which had been broken earlier in the season , caused referee Joey August to stop the bout at tho end of the second round . At that point Lutz was ahead of the Pacific ( ' Dart champion on the scorecards of all three judges . ' The fifth Badger to enter the ring that night in quest of an NCAA championship was Don Dickinson . At the University of Virginia the name Miragliotta meant three fighting brothers from Charleston , West Virginia  --  Ilartl // at 130 pounds , Jimmy at 135 , and Joe at 155  --  but at the University of Wisconsin the three fighting brothers were named Dickinson and they were Don , Dwaine , and Dwight , the stalwart siblings from Tomah , which was a town of approximately 3,800 in the west central part of the state . Don was the first to gain recognition , principally for his knockout punch . In the 1947 championship contest at 155 pounds he was up against another powerful puncher in Herb Carlson , and their battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a split decision . The two rugged battlers exchanged punches freely , with neither giving or taking any quarter . That fight is remembered as one of those bouts in which both contestants go all out and it really does n't seem to make much difference who is officially awarded the decision since so little separates the victor from the vanquished . When the announcement of the winner was made , the crowd responded with a chorus of boos since many in the audience thought Dickinson was on the verge of flooring Carlson in the third round . " This was to be the first of three national titles for Carlson , who served as a referee at a number of NCAA tourneys after he graduated from the University of Idaho . The 5 foot 10 ' inch middleweight was a twenty-two-yearold freshman majoring in business administration when he fought in that 1947 NCAA meet , his first . At Idaho 's Wallace High School he had boxed for four years and starred in football , and he had four fights while serving in the Army Air Corps in World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started boxing when he was six or seven after he coaxed his parents into buying boxing gloves for him for Christmas . He had a couple of built-in sparring partners in his two younger brothers.40 In the mid-1980s ( still weighing about 165 pounds and operating a retail sporting goods store in Nampa , Idaho where he sold rifles , shotguns , and hunting clothing ) Carlson remembered that he really had to " dry out " and starve himself to get under the 155- and 160-pound weight limits . He said boxing was much more satisfying for him when he stopped trying to win every bout by a knockout and relied on boxing skills . He regarded his bout with Jim Rollier of Syracuse in 1950 for the 165-pound championship as his best performance , but believes he did just as well when he beat Raul Diez of San Jose State in his first bout in that tournament . He had split with Diez that year , with the Spartan winning their dual meet contest and Carlson coming out on top in the Pacific Coast tournament finals.41 Of his bout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young you get cocky . I knocked out a few guys and then , pretty soon , I was trying to knockout everybody . That particular year Frank Young , my coach , tried to convince me that I was wrong , and I was . I started trying to box , not // trying to hurt anybody , just win the fight . And winning was easier then and I felt better about myself , and that 's the way I tried to fight Jim . I just boxed him out ' till he hit me in three rounds and I hit him quite a bit . I did n't hit him hard and try to kill him or anything . He was a real nice guy , too.42 Among the incidents from his boxing days that Carlson has stated he wo n't forget is one that occurred his second or third year at the University of Idaho , when he was director and referee for an interfraternity boxing tournament . It seems that since the sororities sponsored the teams that were entered , the first rows around the ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervous and tense as the young men who were participating . In one bout two especially nervous contestants came out , shook hands , removed their robes , and went after each other . However , one was stark naked , but with all the excitement he just launched into his opponent . Carlson had quite a time stopping the bout so that the nude gladiator could gain proper attire.43 On a more serious level , Carlson has concluded that boxing gives a person a degree of self-confidence . I have never been afraid to speak to somebody or to do anything , and it is n't in just physical combat situations . I like football . I liked the contact of it , but there is a difference in boxing . You 're depending upon yourself solely where in football you 've got somebody backing you up or covering for you , or something.4 ? A person who tested Carlson 's self-confidence probably as extensively as any of his opponents was John Lendenski , who won the next title to be contested in the 1947 NCAA tournament . On February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lendenski lost elimination bouts in the national tournament , Lendenski fought the fight of his life against Carlson in a dual meet before 13,000 in Madison . That contest took place prior to the time Carlson decided to apply the science of the sport rather than trying to knock out every opponent . Lendenski jabbed and hooked to take a slight lead over a wildswinging Carlson in the first round . Lendenski extended his advantage with a demonstration of the sharpest of boxing skills in the second when he floored Carlson , and the lean , cardinal-clad Wisconsin boxer had such a pronounced command of the situation in the third that referee Johnny O'Donnell stopped the contest when Carlson went down from a right . This technical knockout win was Lendenski 's greatest triumph , and that bout was one John Walsh and Wisconsin fans consider to be among the best in collegiate boxing history . ' // Lendenski was never as good before nor after that engagement with Carlson , but he turned in a solid performance in decisioning Wayne Fontes of San Jose State for the 165-pound national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with Lendenski jabbing and scoring sufficiently with his left at long range and tying up Fontes to halt infighting where the Spartan had distinct superiority with his hooks . Lendenski won on a split decision , and that win gave Wisconsin the unofficial team title.46 The 6 foot Badger from Natrona , Pennsylvania fought for two more years in the intercollegiate ring and graduated with a bachelor 's degree in sociology . Highly respected as a campus leader from the Phi Delta Theta fraternity as an undergraduate , he worked with juvenile delinquents after he graduated until his death . John Walsh has reported that Lendenski was persuaded to enroll at the University of Wisconsin by a fellow Marine with whom Lendenski shared a foxhole in World War II combat in the South Pacific.07 Lendenski 's title winning performance in the 1947 nationals was followed by that of another combat veteran . Twenty-eight-year-old Laune Erickson , carrying a record of thirty-one wins in thirty-three bouts into the finals , displayed outstanding courage and stamina in the championship contest at 175 pounds . The years had taken their toll on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a strong will to win as he seemed to exert all the energy he could muster in the third round and landed left hooks and right uppercuts to the body to edge South Carolina 's Chuck Spann . Erickson was given one of the finest rounds of applause ever heard in the UW Fieldhouse when it was announced that he was the winner.48 Without taking anything away from Chuck Davey , Erickson certainly appeared worthy of the LaRowe Trophy in this , his last collegiate bout and one in which he won his third NCAA championship . In the concluding engagement of the evening , Art Saey of the University of Miami continued to follow an aggressive plan of attack with a persistence that had characterized his tournament performance from the start . In his heavyweight title battle with Bob Doornink of Washington State , he threw many punches and landed frequently enough with his strong left hook to offset Doornink 's scoring with a left jab . Because of a facial laceration suffered by Saey , referee Billy Williams determined that the bout should cease at 1:51 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 inch , 210-pound athletes Saey had managed to convince two of the three judges that he had the advantage , and the University of Miami had its first championship.09 Throughout the duration of the tournament there was some question about whether Saey could really hit as hard as a man of his physical proportion and prowess should be expected to hit . Henry J. McCormick , while praising Sacy 's " truculence and courage " on one occasion , had written on another that // Saey is a fine looking big boy who does n't seem to hit as hard as would be expected , but he 's dead game and aggressive.SO However , Gene Rankin , former three-time NCAA champion and a Wisconsin assistant coach in the late 1940s , while recognizing that Saey needed room to throw his left observed of the big Hurricane , " He 's strong as a horse , could tear your head off with a left hook and hurt you with a right hand . " ' It would appear reasonable to assume that Art Saey could hit . He lettered in football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame . The St. Louis native had picked up most of his boxing experience in the military service , where he fought exhibition bouts with Joe Louis and former lightheavyweight champion of the world , Joey Maxim . After graduating from Miami Saey taught physical education and took on various educational assignments , including some in the area of special education . He retired in the mid-1980s , and he has reported candidly that he has mixed feelings about the value of his college boxing career . " Z Regardless of his feelings about boxing , he is still held in high esteem by many who have followed athletics at Miami and continue to refer to him as " Champ . " " He was Miami 's first national collegiate boxing champion , but the Hurricanes had been represented in all NCAA tournaments held from 1936 on with the exception of 1937 . William " Billy " Regan was the man responsible for Miami 's development of a major boxing program . A very capable amateur boxing out of Duluth , Minnesota @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mid-1930s . He and John Walsh had become acquainted when they both fought in the 1933 Minneapolis Golden Gloves tournament . While they never fought each other , they traded information on the strengths and weaknesses of opponents they faced in common . ' Regan 's boxers were very much apparent in those NCAA tournaments that took place from 1936 through 1952 , he was active in the boxing coaches ' association and held a number of its leadership posts , and he gained the respect of his fellow coaches , boxers , and athletic administrators involved in intercollegiate boxing . Regan , who refereed the Floyd Patterson-Ingemar Johansson world heavyweight title bout in Miami Beach in 1961 , was much revered by the men he tutored in the ring . His 1952 NCAA champion at 132 pounds , Archie Slaten , has said of him that he was not only a great boxing coach , but he was also a wonderful , unique human being who really cared for his " boys . " Bill was very firm in letting us know that our number one job was school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough of Billy to have him as my best man at my // wedding . u Regan 's Hurricanes scored five points in the 1947 nationals , which were won by Wisconsin in the unofficial tabulation . The Badgers had twentyfour and were trailed by Idaho with twelve , Michigan State with eight , and Penn State , San Jose State , and Syracuse with six each . ' The 1947 NCAA tournament , which realized more financial income than any other national collegiate boxing tournament up to that point , gave a good indication that college boxing had survived World War II and was on the college scene to stay for at least another decade . The next year of that decade was an Olympic year , and the logical answer to the question concerning a most appropriate national tournament site was Madison . The last Olympics had been held twelve years ago and the facts were clear that , of all the sites where NCAA tournaments had been held since the last Olympics , Madison was the place where the crowds were largest . Sixtysix boxers from twenty-five colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 1 through April 3 . The number of contestants equaled that of the 1939 tournament , and the number of sponsoring institutions was one more than in 1939 . Of further note was that the tournament featured participation of a man from a United States territory for the first time , as Rene Berlingeri represented the University of Puerto Rico at 127 pounds . Because it was an Olympic year , the following weight classifications were used : featherweight , 112 pounds , 6 ounces ; bantamweight , 119 pounds ; featherweight , 127 pounds , 12 ounces ; lightweight , 136 pounds , 10 ounces ; welterweight , 147 pounds , 11 ounces ; middleweight , 160 pounds , 15 ounces ; lightheavyweight , 176 pounds , 5 ounces ; and heavyweight , unlimited . " Thursday afternoon 's preliminaries and quarter-finals drew 8,000 spectators as twenty-four boxers saw action highlighted by the split-decision win at 160 pounds by Colin Connel of Minnesota over 1947 NCAA finalist Wayne Fontes of San Jose State . Thursday evening 's seventeen bouts were witnessed by 13,000 . ' Two NCAA defending champions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from behind to gain a split-decision victory before 13,800 in Friday night 's semifinals . In what many college boxing followers believe to be one of the best bouts ever fought in the UW Fieldhouse , Wilbert " Pee Wee " Moss of Louisiana State gained a unanimous decision over Gerald AuClair of Syracuse at 119 pounds . Moss succeeded in beating AuClair to the punch as the Orange fighter attempted repeatedly to land his right hand , which was probably the most devastating in the history of the college bantamweight division . Moss scored with good rights of his own and employed a very effective left jab at crucial points in the bout . Spirited exchanges were frequent throughout the battle , as both men appeared to enjoy the bout the most when the punching was the // fiercest . AuClair seemed to rely almost completely on his right hand for damaging punches but was unable to land solidly enough to stop the aggressive Moss . The ovation that followed the bout indicated the fans ' appreciation.59 Moss , in thinking about their contest of almost half a century ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far the hardest puncher I ever fought . He caught me in the first round of our fight with a right hand that was the hardest I 've ever been hit . Fortunately I caught him in the second round and from then on it was touch and go . " ' Just before that bout Moss was in the dressing room waiting for his turn in the ring when Don Gerrits of Miami was brought in after being knocked out by Andy Quattrocchi of Maryland . Quattrocchi , very concerned about Gerrit 's condition , was standing by the physician who was examining the Miami boxer . As Gerrit 's head was clearing he looked at Quattrocchi and said , " Man , wave the red flag when you blast ! " 61 The second 1947 national champion to be eliminated from competition in the semifinals was Wisconsin 's John Lendenski , who was unable to solve Southern Conference champion Eddie Rieder 's unorthodox style ( characterized by wild , looping overhand punches with both hands ) . The Maryland boxer , landing frequently with these overhand blows but doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won on the scorecards of all three judges.62 The 1947 champion who came from behind was Herb Carlson in his semifinal with Colin Connel . The left-handed Minnesotan had the edge in the first two rounds as his southpaw style seemed to puzzle Carlson , but the Idaho champion rallied in the third to convince two of the three judges that he had earned a win . Some observers credited Carlson 's stamina in the rugged lategoing exchanges for his victory . Connel shed some light on that situation when he referred to Carlson as the best-conditioned man he ever fought . Carlson and Connel fought a number of interesting battles , and in 1949 the latter prevented his Vandal opponent from winning a third national title.63 A record crowd of 15,000 was on hand for the finals to set an all-time record for attendance at NCAA boxing finals and to bring total tournament attendance to 49,800 , another record that was to stand throughout the history of the sport.64 Wisconsin had already won the team championship , which was recognized for the first time officially through the awarding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seconds Association . Sending Steve Gremban , Jim Sreenan , Bob Apperson , Don Dickinson , Cal Vernon , and Vito Parisi to the finals secured that Trophy for the Badgers . Action began with a very close skirmish between two skilled flyweights , and Ernie Charboneau became the third Michigan State boxer to win a national title . Taking the first round by throwing a few more punches , the little Spartan landed some good hooks in the second but his swarthy , veteran opponent from the University of Miami , Jim Demos , evened the contest by scoring with several // sharp left jabs . Both men opened up and engaged in a fast flurry of exchanges , featuring what there was of the third round before they accidentally butted heads . This development resulted in a cut on Demos 's hairline and termination of the bout at 0:33 seconds . ' The split decision went to Charboneau , who has remembered the bout this way : Jimmy Demos and I banged heads , unintentionally , but it was our styles . We both moved in because we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move inside a big man . We both made the same moves and banged heads . I broke my nose actually , a slight hairline fracture right in the center , right on down , nothing serious . We banged heads again in the last round and cut my eye and cut his eye . I was winning the fight . I think it was just one punch that made a difference in the whole fight . It was close except for one punch when I staggered him in the second round . Jimmy was an excellent fighter . ' Winning that 112-pound NCAA championship was the high point in a boxing career that Charboneau had embarked on rather reluctantly at Detroit 's Cooley High School . His first love was football , but he thought he was too small after his sandlot days to pursue that interest further and became involved in many other activities to consume a seemingly endless energy that was apparent whenever he entered the ring . He ran on the track team , was president of his 650-member senior class , made the National Honor Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only boxing competition in high school was in three intramural bouts , and he gave no further thought to amateur boxing until he entered the Marine Corps . As a leatherneck he fought in a couple of smokers and ended up as a member of the Marines ' Cherry Point team , which was one of the best amateur contingents in the United States . He was a runner-up in the North Carolina Golden Gloves tournament before he went overseas . " Charboneau did not box again until his freshman year at Michigan State , where his continued involvement earned four letters , his NCAA championship in 1948 , and the team captaincy . As a natural 118-pounder who could make the 125-pound weight easily with his clothes and shoes on , Charboneau gave away a number of inches in reach and a few pounds when he fought the likes of Gerald AuClair , Steve Gremban , and Pee Wee Moss . AuClair was the only opponent who ever knocked him off his feet , and he reflects with deep satisfaction today on his performances against Moss and Gremban . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they met again an Michigan State faced Louisiana State in the Sugar Bowl boxing classic . Of their Sugar Bowl encounter Charboneau has recounted , // I tell you , he did n't touch me for about two and one-half rounds ; two rounds anyway . I counter-punched him so beautifully ! It was unreal ! I think he took the third round , I do n't know which one , but I know I beat him . He would squat down , get underneath . He especially did that with Steve Gremban . He would try to knock your head off . I always liked Pee Wee and I also respected him . He beat me in the first fight , like I said , but I should have had that one in the Sugar Bowl . In fact after it was announced the winner  - -  Barry J. Barrodale was the referee  --  Pee Wee came across the ring . I forget the exact words , but he said , " I did n't deserve this , you won this fight . " ' Charboneau thought he beat Gremban in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michigan State and Wisconsin tied 4-4 . Although Gremban took the decision officially by two points , Charboneau felt he won and his viewing of the films of the fight confirmed this belief . " In 1984 as he considered the relationship between his college boxing experience and his lifework of teaching physical education and coaching football , baseball , golf , swimming , tennis , and boxing , including sixteen years at innercity Detroit 's McKenzie High School , Charboneau expressed the belief that his boxing background and skills have helped him hold his own in just about every situation and maintain the respect of students . He surmised that boxing ability and experiences " allow you to stand up to whomever you need to . You do n't have to physically use it , but it 's always in reserve and that gives you some kind of personal confidence . " ' The two men against whom Charboneau fought his best collegiate bouts met for the 119-pound championship in the bout that followed the CharboneauDemos clash in the 1948 nationals . The result was a split-decision victory for Gremban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest with his bobbing , weaving , and squatting approach referred to earlier by Charboneau . Gremban , a stand-up-style fighter , jabbed effectively with his left and followed up with right uppercuts to counter Moss 's quick , two-handed flurries . The last round was especially fast paced , and the effort both men exerted was apparent as they were obviously exhausted at the final bell . " In his preparation for the 1948 Olympic tryouts , Gremban proved to be a pioneer in the use of weights to increase his strength . At that time the common belief was that weightlifting tightened up muscles and made athletes immobile or muscle-bound . Gremban 's approach to getting around this contention , which was later revealed to be a myth , was to combine speed bag work with his weightlifting so as not to lose his sharpness . ' Z Gremban fought in both the 1949 and 1950 NCAA tournaments but was eliminated in his first bouts in both of those tournaments . // He received degrees in engineering and law , and he went on to become a patent attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next bout on the final card for the 1948 nationals saw another Badger and another LSU Bayou Tiger square off for the trophy at 127 pounds , 12 ounces . As in the 119-pound championship contest , the judges were divided as to who had won , but this time the Tiger representative , Doug Ellwood , was determined the victor over Wisconsin 's Jim Sreenan . Outlasting Streenan in an encounter which saw both adversaries go after each other with little concern for defense , Ellwood appeared stronger , quicker , and more adept at following advantages . He hurt Sreenan with a left hook to the body , but Sreenan countered with a right to the jaw . In the third round Sreenan forced Ellwood to back up with a strong right , but the Louisiana State boxer seemed to come out ahead in the brisk exchanges that followed.74 Ellwood , who according to his teammate Pee Wee Moss could " punch like a mule for a little man , " became the fourth man in the history of Louisiana State boxing to win a national title.7S Chuck Davey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for positions on the 1948 United States Olympic boxing team and added a third national title to his long list of collegiate boxing accomplishments with a unanimous decision in his lightweight championship bout with Bob Apperson . However , Apperson , as he did in upsetting Andy Quattrocchi of Maryland in the semifinals , continued to astound the tournament crowd , coaches , and other contestants as he succeeded in hitting Davey more times than the clever Spartan had been hit in any of his previous performances in the UW Fieldhouse . Through skill and crisp punching , Davey outpointed Apperson by a slight margin in the first round . But to the amazement of just about every observer , the Wisconsin competitor landed three good rights at the beginning of the second round and several others later on in that period of the contest to actually win the second round . Forced to rally in the third round after being driven to the ropes by a sharp right at the opening bell , Davey made Apperson miss on repeated attempts to land that right again . Davey boxed masterfully in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the judges or anyone else that he was the winner in this bout . For the second straight year his all-around performance earned him the LaRowe Trophy.76 As Davey stepped through the ropes following his victory , the fourth Badger boxer to pursue a national championship that evening entered the ring . However , Don Dickinson reversed the trend established by his teammates Sreenan and Apperson with their two straight losses with a convincing unanimous decision win in his title bout with Don Brown of the California Aggies at 147 pounds , 11 ounces . The fight was stopped after twenty-seven seconds had elapsed in the third round when Brown suffered a laceration under his left eye . The first round had been fairly even , with an edge ( if any ) going to Dickinson . Few scoring punches had been thrown until the latter segment of // that round . Dickinson had been far more aggressive than Brown in the second round and landed solid punches with both hands . One of those blows had been a solid right to the jaw that dropped Brown to his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Referee Barry Barrodale had not considered this a knockdown , but Dickinson eliminated any doubts concerning his superiority in the ring when he scored with a number of jarring rights before the bout was stopped . Dickinson won clearly but Brown 's cast-iron jaw won the respect of the audience for the Aggie stalwart . ' Dickinson went to the national finals for a third straight year in 1949 but lost to Davey . Because he was such a powerful puncher , his boxing ability has been frequently overlooked or underestimated by those following college fisticuffs over the years . But it was evident in any number of his bouts that he could box . One problem he faced continuously during his boxing days was that he cut easily , and it was not until his senior year that mandatory headgear providing protection against cuts became the law in college boxing.78 A solid favorite with Wisconsin boxing fans , Dickinson went on to a career in high school teaching and coaching after his graduation .

This was another contest in which both contestants rocked each other with solid shots to the head and body . The Maryland man threw his characteristic looping rights and lefts to the head and hurt Carlson with left hooks to the body . He in turn was shaken by Carlson 's hooks and straight punches to the head and midsection . It appeared to be a case of the Idahoan being stronger and a better conditioned athlete , with Rieder looking as though he was ready to go down several times as the bout reached its conclusion.80 In the next championship bout Cal Vernon became the first African American to win a national collegiate boxing title . He was not the first black , however , to box in an NCAA tournament .

While Don Presley , a black heavyweight boxing for San Jose State , was a finalist in the 1940 Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Boxing Association tournament and Townsend the 1942 Pacific Coast champion , very few African Americans competed in boxing at predominantly white colleges and universities until the late 1940s and early 1950s . ' The CIAA ( initially called the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association until 1951 and , thereafter , the Central Intercollegiate Athletic // Association ) " began holding boxing tournaments for predominantly and historically African American colleges in the mid-1930s , but no mention was made of activities at those institutions in information presented in NCAA Boxing Guides until 1948.84 In the late 1940s and through 1954 when the last CIAA boxing tournament took place , Howard University , Morgan State , Hampton Institute ( later Hampton University ) , and North Carolina A and T sponsored the leading programs .

The Vernon-Diehl bout was stopped by referee Frank Gilmer at 1:08 of the second round when the Badger boxer sustained a cut over his left eye .

Parisi weighed 174 pounds , and Saey came into the ring at close to 210 and had appeared in his preliminary bout performance to be much improved over his form in 1947 , when he became Miami 's first national champion . Before the fight Henry McCormick emphasized , Saey is a prohibitive favorite to win the heavyweight championship , but the Miami giant again showed some of his weaknesses of a year ago ; he still is easy to hit and he goes down when he 's tagged emphatically . On the other hand he also has the assets of a year ago with something to boot ; he 's as tough as ever , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his wicked left and has a right hand that is much better than a year ago . -4 The Six-Minute Fraternity Saey goes up against Wisconsin 's Vito Parisi , a streamlined heavyweight who may have more heart than sense . He ca n't trade punches with the Miami giant ; maybe he ca n't win by keeping on the move and sharp-shooting , but there 's his chance.89 Mention of the Parisi-Saey fight of 1948 will still get off enthusiastic iscussion at George Fabian 's Park Street Shoe Repair in the southside neighborhood in Madison where Vito Parisi grew up . The handsome Sicilian American was Rocky Balboa of the Sylvester Stallone Rocky films . He was the - cal boy who did the impossible and beat the champ . Park Street Shoe Repair i the 1980s was a gathering place for sports enthusiasts , including retirees , area usinesspeople , other locals , and frequently personnel from the University of Wisconsin Athletic Department . Elroy " Crazy Legs " Hirsch of Los Angeles Lams fame and former UW athletic director was known to stop in at the shop . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin boxing s if they occurred yesterday , because they had been in those Fieldhouse crowds at reveled in the Badgers ' reign over the collegiate fisticuff world.90 The folks at Park Street Shoe Repair remember that Parisi went right t Saey when the opening bell sounded . Parisi used straight left jabs followed , y looping right hooks to the jaw , keeping on top of the big Hurricane fighter nd moving away from that powerful left hook . The Badger 's constant rowding of Saey prevented the champ from having the room he needed to ' prow that punch . With a background of the loudest crowd roar ever heard in e UW Fieldhouse , the slim Badger took the first two rounds and broke even a the last frame , which saw both combatants completely exhausted . At the end sere was no doubt that Parisi was the winner in the minds of all three judges nd in the minds and hearts of the 15,000 who witnessed this unbelievable upset nd a contest Wisconsin coaches , boxers , and fans regard as one of the all-time est in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parisi reported from his Buick ealership in Englewood , Colorado in discussion of that event , I just lucked out . I tell you , the day before the fight I asked Chuck Davey and Vito Schiro a Madisonian from Parisi 's neighborhood and an outstanding Badger boxer of the 1930s , " What 'll I do with this guy ? " You know because I was going to get killed , and it did n't bother me because everybody expected me to get knocked cold . I said , " Well , I 'll just go out , and if I get knocked out what will be the difference . Nobody is going to care , and if I win , great ! " But these guys said , " Use a left hand against him . " They were both // southpaws and they said to go in a different direction than he 's normally used to , and that 's what happened , and not getting hit certainly helped . ' John Walsh has made some observations concerning Saey 's left hand that provide insight on Parisi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion meant that his power left hand became his lead hand to be held high and extended in front of him . From that position it was used to jab and to protect him from right-hand counters . When Saey had been fighting from his natural southpaw stance before his conversion , that power left hand had been held lower and closer to his side since his right was held high and extended in front of him . As a southpaw when he threw that left , he had plenty of room and momentum because he held it lower and it could travel more distance . When he converted to an orthodox style he had a tendency , like many converted southpaws , to drop the left before he threw it , because he thought he needed more distance to gain momentum and power . Hence , when he threw his strong left hook he did n't throw it from a held high and extended position but dropped it , leaving his jaw unprotected from a quick right hook . Saey never completely corrected this flaw in his style , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Additional insight on the results of the Parisi-Saey fight was furnished by Art Saey himself in 1984 , when he commented that his coach Bill Regan instructed him to try to outbox Parisi rather than engage in a slugging contest . According to Saey , Regan 's rationale for such an approach was that Saey could win the John S. LaRowe Trophy by showing people that he could box . In retrospect Saey believed that this was a serious mistake since he never was a boxer and had a better chance to win by slugging and underplaying the skills and science aspect of the sport.94 Parisi did not box his junior year at Wisconsin . In the 1948 nationals he had reached the top of the intercollegiate ladder and seemed to lose interest in the sport after that . However , he could not stay away from the ring and came back in 1950 to compete in some dual meets . He has stated that he really did not have the motivation and desire that he had in 1948 and did not train vigorously . As a result he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he been in better physical condition . " Parisi 's 1985 reflections of his involvement in boxing revealed that he was only four years old when he and his brother put on the gloves and went after each other to entertain customers at his father 's speakeasy in the Depression days . He boxed in grade school and in the intramural program at West High School in Madison , where he was also an end on the football team . Former Badger boxer Vito Schiro , who was his cousin , taught him the fundamentals of boxing but more significantly indoctrinated him in the spirit of the sport as it was in effect on college campuses . According to Parisi , Schiro // never wanted anybody to get hurt and he just taught the basics of boxing and that you never want to go out and hurt somebody . He was probably one of the greatest boxers that ever came out of Wisconsin , but he taught the artistic form of boxing . Anytime you got somebody in trouble , you backed off and let him go again . None of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway , ever had that killer instinct . " Those 1985 reflections also included praise for Wisconsin boxing coaches . Of John Walsh and Vern Woodward Parisi said , They treated us like absolute human beings as opposed to say some of today 's coaches in football , basketball , and something where you sacrifice everything for them . You know , when some coaches do that today . When you had a loss they Walsh and Woodward comforted you saying , " Hey , there 's other times to win . " They were so far ahead of their time . Super people ! Super human beings ! They would go out of their way at anytime to really help you out . ' Parisi , who served in the military right after high school graduation , has worked for the Wisconsin Parole Department and Schlitz Brewing Company , has managed a golf course , and has been in the insurance business . He candidly has expressed mixed feelings about the value of participation in college boxing for him . On the one hand , he has said that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're faced with something you can go out and try to do a job . And if you 're put down you say , " Hey , I 've been down before . I 'll come back again . " And the realistic thing about it is that you feel good about yourself , knowing that you can do something for somebody else and do something for yourself at the same time . But you never have an ego about it . That 's not a big thing . To win is not as important as really trying " On the other hand , however , his overall assessment of the sport has caused him to conclude that all boxing should be abolished . He claims to have known punch drunk college boxers and has never allowed his own sons to participate in the sport . " There were no mixed messages concerning the top team in the 1948 NCAA tournament as Wisconsin amassed forty-five points and was far ahead of the other leaders : Michigan State with nineteen ; Idaho with fourteen ; Louisiana // State with twelve ; Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the John J. Walsh Trophy for the team championship , the NCAA Boxing Rules Committee implemented a scoring system in which one point was awarded for a boxer gaining the semifinals . That boxer would earn for his team three points in addition by reaching the finals and an additional five points if he won the championship . In the past in the calculation of the unofficial team champion , points had not been cumulative . A winner had received only five points instead of nine , a finalist only three points , and a semifinalist only one point.101 While the NCAA tournament was a success in terms of attendance and generating income , the champions it produced did not fare too well in the Olympic final tryouts held in Boston on June 28 and 29 . Only Doug Ellwood and Chuck Davey qualified for the team , and they did so as alternates . However , college boxing was well-represented on the thirteen-member United States Olympic Boxing Committee by Carl Schott of Penn State , Roy Simmons of Syracuse , William Bleckwenn of Wisconsin , T. P. Heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John Merriman of the Coast Guard . Further , John Walsh served as a cocoach of the Olympic boxing team along with John Mendonca.102 Ernie Charboneau and Steve Gremban were both eliminated in their first tryout bouts when they sustained cuts over their eyes , and under AAU rules governing the tryouts they were declared losers by technical knockout . Don Dickinson suffered the same fate in his first encounter . Herb Carlson , after winning his first bout by a knockout , lost by a decision in his second . Cal Vernon was outpointed in his first contest and Art Saey , representing the NCAA in the heavyweight division , was knocked out by Coley Wallace , who was later to do well in the professional ranks as well as star in the movie The Joe Louis Story.103 Dickinson 's sustaining a cut in his first competition was indeed unfortunate because he appeared to be the best of the welterweights in the tryouts . Carlson was ahead on points in his second bout but tired badly in the third round and lost a close decision to Army champion Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in superb physical condition in the collegiate ring , had not been able to do sufficient roadwork because of a leg infection . He seemed to be the top middleweight in Boston.104 Ellwood , after two impressive victories , lost in the finals at Boston . Davey decisioned Navy champion Edwin Muffin in the first day of competition . On the second day the Spartan lightweight outpointed John Saxton , New York City Golden Gloves champion , and lost a decision to Wallace " Bud " Smith , Chicago Golden Gloves titlist.103 Both of these men , whom Davey fought on the same day , were to go on to be world professional champions . Saxton won the welterweight title on a controversial decision in 1954 in a bout with the same // Kid Gavilan , who knocked out Davey in 1953.106 Smith became lightweight champion in 1955.107 Davey , who believes he is the only person to ever have boxed two future world champions on the same day , had an ideal Olympic style but politics , apparently related to the power of the AAU , prevented Walsh from using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the tryouts winner and a product of the AAU and Golden Gloves system . Walsh has expressed the belief that the eight collegians participating in the tryouts would have fared much better in the Olympics than did the eight men who actually represented the United States in London . The style of the collegians and NCAA boxing rules were much more consistent with Olympic guidelines and expectations than were the styles of the AAU developed boxers and the AAU rules for conduct in the ring . The Boston tryouts had been conducted under AAU rules which were quite different from Olympic rules , and the Americans were at a disadvantage and suffered in London because of this . United States boxers were warned and penalized continuously for holding and hitting , delivering punches improperly , and lowering their heads when moving inside . 108 In other Olympic developments relative to collegiate boxing , it should be noted that a Detroit high school student by the name of Charles Spieser won the lightheavyweight position on the United States team , scored a victory in his first bout at London , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Africa , the gold medal winner.109 Another contestant in the lightheavyweight division in the Boston tryouts was Carl Di Bernardo of Miami , who lost his first bout . Spieser was to go on to attend Michigan State and Di Bernardo the University of Miami , with the former winning NCAA titles in 1951 and 1952 and the latter a national collegiate championship in 1949.110 They faced each other in the 1950 NCAA semifinals , with Spieser gaining the decision . " ' Davey , the only man to win four NCAA titles , did not have the opportunity to represent his country in the Olympics and win a gold medal . Ironically , however , Gerald Dreyer , the South African winning the gold medal in the lightweight division in the 1948 Olympics , was beaten by Davey a few years later in a ten-round professional fight in Oakland , California . " ' Chapter 8 The End of the Badger Decade , a Rebel Yell and a Western Uprising : 1949-1950 Serving as president from 1941 to 1969 , John Hannah built Michigan State from an agricultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 41,000 and offering academic majors in more than 200 different fields . ' Hannah not only knew a lot about higher education but also understood the distinctive position of boxing among American college sports . In addressing the NCAA Rules Committee , coaches , participants , and guests at a luncheon leading off the twelfth annual NCAA boxing tournament at East Lansing , he said , You have all heard much talk and oratory about the lessons to be learned from team play . They are great lessons to be sure . But I wonder whether the lessons the lone competitor learns are not even more valuable . You as boxers could tell me , for you are all alone when you step into the ring to meet your opponent . You have no team-mates battling shoulder to shoulder with you , no quarterback to call the signals , no coach to tip off the pitch , no man to whom to pass the ball if you get into a tight corner , and not even the comfort of a number of competitors . It is just you , the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if the training you receive in self-reliance , in keeping your heads in a pinch , of measuring and marshalling your strength and ability against the opponent , of the necessity of utter-self-dependence at all times is not the best training of all for the world in which you must make your way when your college days are over . For there come times in every man 's life when he must face up to great issues , alone , without the aid of friends or family , when he must depend on his head and his heart to // bring him through the crisis . Such days and nights come to every man . Those with faith , and courage , and calm selfreliance win out . Those who lack those inner elements of true manhood fail and fall . If when those crises come to you , some lesson you have learned in the ring comes to your aid , then college has been worthwhile for you . ' A number of valuable lessons were learned by those involved in the 1949 nationals at Michigan State . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sport , the teams learned that very little in life can be taken for granted , that effort must be exerted to the fullest to the very end of the battle with no letdown allowed , and that luck and fate can never be denied . Five former national champions learned that there always seems to be someone better than you are no matter how good you get and that opponents are capable of rising to occasions , coming up with great performances regardless of what their past records might indicate . In the 1949 tournament competition only one of the former champions entered was able to repeat , and that was the seemingly invincible Chuck Davey . Former NCAA team champions Wisconsin , Syracuse , Penn State , Virginia , and Catholic University found themselves well behind the leaders as the team scores were totaled at the end of the tournament . That Wisconsin dynasty in boxing and domination of the last four NCAA tournaments , which was expected to continue for years , came to an abrupt end . Also coming to an end as the decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chairmanship of Crip Toomey . The man who had guided intercollegiate boxing throughout most of that period stepped down , and his position went to Dr. William J. Bleckwenn.3 Toomey , however , was to remain as a committee member for a number of years . Assuming leadership of the Rules Committee after the 1939 NCAA tournament , the University of California at Davis athletic director may not have been the father of intercollegiate boxing , but he certainly helped shape the course of its direction during formative years . Toomey , who died in 1961 , spent thirty-three years at what started out as the University of California College of Agriculture and later became a full-fledged university in its own right . He coached boxing , football , basketball , and baseball and served as athletic director and chairman of the Department of Physical Education . In his undergraduate days he was an outstanding halfback and dropkicker on Andy Smith 's University of California " Wonder Teams . " However , boxing rather than football appeared to be his special interest when he joined the athletic staff at Davis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Boxing Association tournament in 1932 , the same year that his national involvement in the sport began , when he assisted in determining the method for the selection of // the best boxers in the West for participation in the first national tournament . Toomey again served as chairman of the Rules Committee for the 1954 , 1955 , and 1956 seasons and was honored with a lifetime membership in the Intercollegiate Boxing Coaches Association . Toomey , who was said to have had an amazing memory when it came to friends , former athletes , and details of sports events , was twice honored through resolutions of the California State Legislature . In 1947 and again in 1957 that body recognized him for " the splendid manner in which he supervised the program of clean athletics and sportsmanship " at his institution . In 1981 he was inducted into the University of California Davis Sports Hall of Fame . ' In 1948 Toomey and his Rules Committee colleagues were very concerned about the fact that seven bouts in that year 's NCAA tournament had to be stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were aware that headgear had been used quite successfully by San Jose State boxers in dual meets . The result of Committee members ' concern was that protective headgear was mandatory for contestants in the 1949 national tournament . The rule change bringing this about read as follows : As a protection against eye cuts , ear and head injuries , a light competitive headgear must be worn by each participant in dual meets and tournament competition . Such headgear must provide for a layer of sponge rubber one-half inch in thickness covering the ears , eye ridge , temples , and back of head . ' Another development in 1949 related to the influence of college boxing on the physical and psychological health of participants . At the request of the University of Wisconsin faculty , officials at that institution began an extensive study with the start of the boxing season . The instigation of the study was another reaction to the claims of those opposing the sport on medical grounds . From its first days of implementation on college campuses , boxing had been a target for educators and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to competitors and the rationale that the purpose of the sport was actually to do bodily injury to an opponent . The 1940 research report by Kennedy , Thacker , and Gebhart was still very much in the minds of boxing foes in 1949 , and another article based largely upon that study had gained widespread attention in 1944 . Drawing essentially on the conclusions presented by Kennedy and coworkers , Arthur H. Steinhaus , physiologist and dean of George Williams College , denounced boxing because of his contention that it caused brain damage and the intent of the sport was to injure the opponent . Steinhaus , who was to author a similar publication in 1953 , discounted arguments that cited insurance underwriters ranking boxing seventh among hazardous sports behind such activities as crew , football , and wrestling in terms of injuries to participants . // He claimed that those rankings were misleading because being unconscious for ten seconds was not counted as an injury in boxing but was in football and other contact sports . ' As has been pointed out , Kennedy and coworkers did not differentiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that conclusions related specifically to information gained on college boxing injuries could not be isolated from information concerning professional boxing . Based on the belief that research related directly to the effects of college boxing was needed , the Wisconsin study was undertaken under the supervision of Dr. John W. Brown , director of the University 's Department of Student Health . In explaining the study Brown stated , The study is being approached as a clinical investigation utilizing the methods of the medical research scientist . The physicians conducting it have not been identified previously with boxing in any manner but are experienced in medicine and in the disciplines of clinical research . Specialists in all branches of medicine from the Faculty of the University of Wisconsin Medical School are available for consultation and guidance . The most important feature is concerned with the search for facts of a medical nature relative to the effects of this sport . This effort includes observation of all activities of the boxing squad at Wisconsin in practice or in competition , a comprehensive examination utilizing special techniques before , after , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insofar as the reliability of these is unquestioned . Several times during this season examination and testing of members of competing teams was possible . The examination of members of many teams was continuous during the National Tournament . ' The study included examination and testing of contestants at the 1949 NCAA tournament " through courtesy , and in fact stimulus , of the NCAA Rules Committee , " according to Brown . ' The Committee 's support and encouragement of this study , which was to continue through the 1952 season , was consistent with what the Committee had done historically to protect the health and safety of participants through the development of equipment . As has been discussed , glove size was raised from 10 to 12 ounces in 1938 . Padding became entirely goat hair , which was more resilient than the old combination of horse hair and kapok , and a leather web attached the thumb to the main part of the glove to avoid thumb and " thumbing " injuries.10 From an early point in college boxing development , it was required that ring padding be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kapok , or other soft substance over a wood or other firm material surface . " It has already been stated that protective headgear became mandatory in 1949 , and it should be added that another measure taken by the Rules Committee out of concern for the health and safety of contestants , though not related to equipment , was that a count of nine had to be taken by any man who was knocked down in competition from 1943 on . This requirement appears to have been the forerunner of the professional ring 's standing eight-count of later years.12 College boxing actually pioneered many safety improvements for amateur competition , and in more recent years armed forces boxing has been patterned after the collegiate approach of NCAA tournament times.13 A major contributor to health and safety advancements in college boxing was the man who took on chairmanship responsibilities of the NCAA Boxing Rules Committee in 1949 . William J. Bleckwenn , a neuropsychiatrist on the University of Wisconsin Medical School Faculty , became a member of the Rules Committee in 1939 and served as a member in the 1940s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II service in the Army Medical Corps . Chairing the Rules Committee from 1949 to 1954 , Dr. Bleckwenn was a steadfast advocate of college boxing when it was conducted under the right conditions . The man who as a colonel had been a member of General MacArthur 's staff in the Pacific Theatre14 said , in defending college boxing and in stressing how programs should be conducted , that For a number of years college boxing has been in a precarious position as an intercollegiate sport . Many colleges have been reluctant to develop intramural and intercollegiate boxing because of the dangers involved and the lack of student and faculty support . It is safe to say that quite generally college faculties are opposed to college boxing . They think of it primarily as an activity in which one boy deliberately tries to inflict physical punishment on his opponent . They overlook the training of a young man which promotes physical fitness , quick thinking , agility , courage , skill , self-confidence and sportsmanship . Who can say they ever knew a boxer to be a bully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy or man who realizes that he can meet any situation that might arise . This very excellent sport must , however , be properly regulated and controlled . It must be coached as a college sport . The best of equipment for training and contests must be utilized . If these factors are not considered in the development of the sport , college boxing should be abolished . Rules must be enforced . The spirit of any rule can // be broken by an unscrupulous coach or contestant . Those who seek to violate the rules are undesirable men to coach or compete , and such offenders must go . Only officials who understand college boxing rules should be employed . Coaches must preserve the same high standards necessary in other sports . In fact , there is no other sport in which improper methods of coaching are so evident to the spectator as in boxing . The coach guilty of teaching unfair , unsportsmanlike tricks and methods is a menace to the sport and he must be replaced . Schools which condone such coaching should be dropped from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his squad by proper road work , calisthenics , rope jumping , light and heavy bag punching , shadow boxing , and short periods of actual boxing . A coach must drop from the squad boys who neglect their condition or who fail to improve in the art of boxing.15 Boxing was a science to Bleckwenn and had many of the aspects of fencing art and skill that he appreciated . He did not like knockouts and quick knockout specialists.16 Boxing was a serious business for him , especially as adherence to rules was concerned . But there was a matter in a lighter vein he had to consider at the 1949 NCAA tournament . It seems that three coaches , returning to their East Lansing hotel from a social function that apparently involved some imbibing of spirits , caused a considerable commotion one night . Evidently Billy Regan 's claim to being captain of the Coral Gables Volunteer Fire Department was questioned by John Walsh and Billy Williams . Regan 's response to his colleagues ' challenge was an effort to demonstrate his skills with a hotel fire extinguisher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint was peeled from a wall , and an elderly permanent resident of the hotel experienced considerable stress because she thought the building was really on fire . The mild chaos and confusion created by this incident was of sufficient degree to be brought to Bleckwenn 's attention the next morning . The fire captain from Coral Gables and his Wisconsin and Virginia cohorts had to appear before the Rules Committee , which administered a quick " slap on the wrist " and required the three " firemen " to pay for the damage . " It is not too difficult to imagine Walsh 's chagrin at having to appear before Bleckwenn , a faculty member at the Badger coach 's own institution , for his schoolboy antics , but undoubtedly he was even more chagrined when his team failed to win a single championship and scored only four points in the entire tournament , as Don Dickinson was the only Badger to get beyond his first bout . The first of Walsh 's boxers to lose was Steve Gremban , the 1948 titlist // at 119 pounds . Fighting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Cronin of Catholic University . Then Jim Sreenan , a finalist at 127 pounds in the previous year 's tournament , was outpointed by Idaho 's Norm Walker at 130 pounds . Don Dickinson fought his way to the 145-pound finals only to lose to Chuck Davey and fail to repeat as the NCAA welterweight champion . Don 's brother , Dwaine , was decisioned by Terrapin Eddie Rieder at 155 pounds , 1947 165-pound national champion John Lendenski was beaten by Louisiana State 's Lloyd Jones ; and heavyweight Bob Ranck dropped a decision to Marty Crandell of Syracuse , whom he had outpointed in a dual meet earlier that year.18 Joining Gremban and Lendenski among former champions going down to defeat at East Lansing were Ernie Charboneau , Michigan State 's NCAA flyweight titlist in 1948 , and Herb Carlson , the national champion from Idaho at 155 pounds in 1947 and 160 pounds in 1948 . The former lost to Mac Martinez of San Jose State at 125 pounds and the latter to Minnesota 's Colin Connel in the 165-pound division . Thus , Carlson was denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he competed in four national tournaments , to win a total of four NCAA championships.19 Chuck Davey was not denied that opportunity and did attain his fourth national title and his third John S. LaRowe Trophy by outboxing Don Dickinson . The rugged Badger tried desperately to land a knockout punch with his powerful right hand in the second and third rounds , but his quicker Spartan opponent duplicated his March 12 dual meet win over Dickinson , catching him with scoring punches as the Badger moved in and moved out Z0 Interestingly , in the first round when Dickinson was " boxing " and attempting to build up points , the bout seemed to be closer than it was in the second and third rounds , when the Wisconsin veteran of finals in three national tournaments succumbed to the widely held notion that Davey must be floored to be beaten . There is some opinion that Davey even traded punches with the stronger Dickinson in the third round , a round in which referee Eddie Haislett halted action momentarily and cautioned the combatants about not stepping back from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Associated Press reported that he had " won the most lopsided bout of the evening as he outboxed Wisconsin 's Don Dickinson by a country mile . " ' Davey 's Michigan State team was very much in the running for the John J. Walsh Trophy right up to the last bout of the tournament . However , Louisiana State , coached by J. T. " Jim " Owen , had jumped off to an early lead in team scoring when W. 0 . " Pee Wee " Moss and E. E. " Tad " Thrash won the first two titles to be contested ; at 125 pounds Moss bested Mac Martinez and at 130 pounds Thrash beat Norm Walker . ' Moss 's decision over Martinez may have been by the narrowest of margins , but it was unanimous . Throughout the fight these scrappy lighter // adversaries exchanged punches at a torrid pace , as referee Barry Barrodale seemed to let them punch their way in and out of clinches in a manner that had not been permitted in prior bouts in the tournament . In the ferocious action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with both battlers seeming to score at will . ' Moss , who retired in 1982 from the position of principal of Baton Rouge 's Kenilworth Junior High School , looked back a couple of years after his retirement at that 1948 bout and observed that , although Gerald AuClair had been the hardest puncher he met in college , Mac Martinez " was the toughest I ever fought . He was constantly coming forward and punches did not seem to bother him . " ' Moss , a 1959 inductee into the Louisiana State University Athletic Council 's Hall of Fame and a person whose lifework involved school administration , teaching , coaching , and guidance counseling , has viewed his participation in college boxing in a positive manner : As a small person it gave me tremendous confidence in myself in whatever I tried to do . In boxing you take some licks , you get knocked down , but if you work hard , the licks do n't hurt as bad and you learn to get up and keep going and good things happen to you . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy and most problems can be solved if you respect the other side.26 Moss first started solving problems in the ring when he entered as a novice in the 1943 Beaumont , Texas Golden Gloves tournament , and he entered only because a high school friend entered on the condition that Moss would do likewise . Further amateur boxing for Moss was in other Golden Gloves competition , intercity matches , Catholic Youth Organization shows , Navy engagements , and collegiate endeavors at LSU , with the 1949 NCAA final bout with Martinez as his last boxing of any type . Concerning this experience he has stated , " As I look back , boxing and the lessons I learned in boxing have helped me to look life straight in the eye , take the good with the bad , do the best I can and accept it as it comes . " ' Tad Thrash 's win , which came on the heels of Moss 's last fight , was through a unanimous decision in a bout that was terminated late in the second round when his opponent Norm Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the fit and wearing of his protective headgear . The contestants had sparred cautiously in the first round , with Walker taking the lead by scoring the more legitimate and forceful punches ; but Thrash , continuing to be the aggressor through the second round , landed enough solid blows to overcome Walker 's edge and take the decision.28 Thrash was a boxer of no mean ability , and his achievements after his intercollegiate ring successes are // worthy of note . He repeated as an NCAA champion in 1950 . From there he continued his relationship with Louisiana State University boxing , succeeding Owen as coach and earning a Ph.D . degree in economics while mentoring the Tigers . Working with his alma mater in the area of alumni relations and institutional advancement after LSU dropped intercollegiate boxing , Thrash advanced to the position of Executive Secretary and Director , Board of Trustees of State Institutions of Higher Learning in the state of Mississippi . Until his retirement from that position , he championed the cause of higher education in the same vigorous manner that he had gone after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in Mississippi and his bearing in carrying out his duties prompted a consultant to the Board to refer to him favorably as a smaller General George S. Patton ? A vigorous attack and continuous scoring with a strong overhand right were apparently responsible for Idaho 's heavier Walker brother , Leonard , winning from Pat Dougherty of Michigan State in the 1949 national tournament finals at 135 pounds . In the first round both men appeared to be more interested in landing damaging blows than in scoring points , and neither had any noticeable advantage . Toward the end of the second round the Vandal boxer succeeded in landing some solid punches to take that round , and he won the third , countering with some strong rights as Dougherty attempted to catch up in scoring through forcing the action.30 After Dougherty 's teammate , Chuck Davey , had disposed of Don Dickinson at 145 pounds , Wayne Fontes kept San Jose State 's team championship hopes alive when two of the three people with official responsibility for judging his contest with Eddie Rieder believed he was the winner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either way . In that bout the short , solid and powerful Spartan put his Terrapin opponent on the canvas in the first round with a hard right . The awkward-looking Rieder scored enough with looping rights in the second round to break even with Fontes . The third round had little clear scoring by either man , but Fontes 's aggressiveness and consistency appeared to account for his margin of victory.3 ' Fontes , who was physically constructed like a small Army tank and had the reputation of being one of the hardest punchers in college boxing in the late 1940s , was a virtual perpetual motion machine in the ring and was always in such good physical condition that he could sustain a blistering pace throughout his bouts and run his opponents " out of gas . " 32 He was the product of the San Jose State University boxing system . He , like so many other of his Spartan boxing colleagues , had no experience prior to his freshman year since the California Interscholastic Federation prohibition of boxing affected his high school and he had not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Jose State boxing system , it can be said that boxing was included in sport activity instruction given to all male students . To // most vividly was one to Nebraska to box Wayne State Teachers College : They were starting up a boxing program there and Coach Chisholm agreed to lend the prestige of the University of Minnesota to insignificant Wayne State in exchange for a tuneup for his first string fighters . We rode the bus out there and were a little tired , but why worry about these simple cowboys and Indians from the sand hills of Nebraska . We won the first bout , I think , but in the next four our boys had to have help getting back to the dressing room . Blood was all over the place . Then I got in there with their best fighter . They really wanted this one , but I got the decision after a very tough fight . This turned the tide and we got out of Nebraska with a tie for the match . ' Connel , a man whose career pursuits have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , agriculturalist , and park keeper , had some candid reflections in 1984 on his boxing days and the sport in general : From here , thirty-five years later , it all seemed to be a lot of fun . Whether I 'm a better person because of boxing , I ca n't say . Some critics will say boxing is out of tune with the times , because it reinforces macho behavior and thought processes . In this day of the atomic bomb we do n't want to encourage aggressive tendencies so maybe boxing ought to be phased out as it has been already at the U. of M. However , I 'm living proof that not all boxers are fascists . I 'm for ERA , the freeze , Mondale-Ferraro ( was ) , anti-capitalistic . . . agnostic , etc . ' If there should happen to be a specific boxing personality characterized by an aggressive , competitive , macho , male chauvinist approach to life and right-wing political and economic beliefs , Connel certainly does not appear to fit that model . Carl Di Bernardo , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ideal collegiate lightheavyweight , at least in the perception of Henry J. McCormick , who wrote that the best fighter in the tournament  --  as it developed  --  was Carl Bernardo , the NCAA lightheavyweight champion from Miami ; they could have given him the LaRowe Trophy and done // nobody an injustice.41 Di Bernardo ( or Bernardo as he was called by the press and as he is identified in the intercollegiate boxing records ) won by a good margin from Army 's Pete Monfore , the EIBA titlist , working mostly at long range in the first round and defending well against the Cadet 's moves to get inside . Avoiding Monfore 's lunges , the Hurricane boxer countered his opponent 's efforts with good shots from both hands and increased his lead in the second round . Di Bernardo looked even stronger in the third as he continued to belt Monfore with solid lefts and rights . As Monfore was forcing the fighting because of being behind , he went to the floor . Referee Billy Williams ruled that it was a slip and not a knockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punches had something to do with it . Di Bernardo 's victory was by unanimous decision.42 A highly successful attorney in the South Miami area after his intercollegiate boxing years , Di Bernardo was asked in 1984 about the meaning of boxing for him : Being involved in boxing gave me the opportunity to meet and make many friends with many people from all walks of life . I believe it adds considerably to your self-confidence in dealing with people and facing problem situations 43 Dale Matthews and Bill Ohlandt of The Citadel and Gabriel Marek and Chuck Spieser of Michigan State were Di Bernardo 's most formidable opponents , and his performance against Marek in the 1949 NCAA semifinals was the best of his career.44 Mickey Demos , Di Bemardo 's former teammate who fought in the 1951 and 1952 NCAA tournaments and was the team physician for U.S. boxers in the 1984 Olympics , expressed the belief that Di Bernardo is an excellent example of what college boxing can do for our students . He became an attorney as a result of college boxing . He is an outstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a great tribute to college boxing.45 Gabriel Marek , mentioned by Di Bernardo as one of his toughest adversaries , was also one of the most difficult opponents Marty Crandell met . In fact , Marek eliminated Crandell from 1950 NCAA tournament competition via a technical knockout.46 But at the conclusion of the 1949 nationals Crandell was on top of the college boxing world . The Syracuse heavyweight defeated Don Schaffer of San Jose State for the championship . If Schaffer had // won , San Jose State would have been the tournament 's team champion . Crandell 's victory represented a team victory for Louisiana State and the John J. Walsh Trophy . Out of gratitude Louisiana State University officials granted Crandell honorary membership in the " L " club , although the handsome Orangeman had never attended a class at the Baton Rouge institution . " To the joy of Coach Jim Owen and his team of Moss , Thrash , Al Bourgeois , Burl Jobe , Lloyd Jones , and Jack Dyer , Crandell won handily from Schaffer , although Schaffer started out well in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Crandell was unable to land any effective punches . The second round saw the Syracuse athlete find the range with both hands as he solved the Spartan 's style and prevented him from moving inside . A right uppercut to the chin shook Schaffer , but he stayed on his feet as Crandell continued to score with strong rights . Crandell completely dominated action in the third , and Schaffer was fortunate that he was not knocked out.48 When the bout was over but before the judges ' scorecards were tallied , Schaffer is reported to have said to Crandell , " Marty , you really licked me good . It is the first time this season that I feel I have been badly beaten . " " Martin Chester Crandell had the reputation of being a quiet , modest , and rather soft-spoken person who did not enjoy talking about himself . However , his accomplishments in athletics prior to his matriculation at Syracuse spoke for themselves . In high school in Newark , New Jersey he was a fullback in football and two-year city champion in the high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his senior class and athletic director at a YMCA camp . He won the Golden Gloves and New Jersey AAU heavyweight titles as a seventeen-year-old , having started boxing at age fifteen with his brother , Larry , seven years his senior . At Syracuse Crandell was an officer in the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity and was involved in Methodist fellowship activities.30 Crandell fought some outstanding battles with Bob Ranck , and he and the Wisconsin heavyweight became good friends , corresponding with each other and maintaining contact up to Crandell 's death in 1978.51 Chuck Drazenovich proved to be Crandell 's nemesis . While Crandell decisioned the Nittany Lion in their first bout and lost a close contest with him in the EIBA finals in 1949 , Drazenovich demonstrated complete mastery over the Orange boxer in their two engagements in 1950.52 Crandell 's first year in competition for Syracuse was highlighted by an auspicious and dramatic performance in Miami . As a sophomore on December 30 , 1948 he fought Art Saey in the Syracuse-Miami meet in the Orange Bowl . Before the match there was extensive talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had been offered $40,000 for four professional fights.53 Crandell was a definite underdog , weighing about 184 pounds to Saey 's 210 . However , Roy Simmons had observed ( as John Walsh had also noted in watching Saey ) that the big converted southpaw dropped his left before // he threw it , and Simmons made sure that Crandell was well aware of this flaw . Simmons was convinced that his young heavyweight could beat Saey and expressed this belief to several Syracuse businessmen who were staunch Syracuse fans and had followed the Orange to Miami . Simmons stated further that money could be made by betting on Crandell in wagers with the locals . Midway through the first round Simmons 's prophecy came true as Crandell landed his strong right over Saey 's left hook and knocked him cold . In the commotion and excitement in Crandell 's corner after the knockout , Simmons felt a tug at his pants ' leg . He turned around and was given a handful of bills by one of the Syracuse businessmen who had bet on Crandell . Simmons promptly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the victorious heavyweight was to keep some of it , give the rest to his teammates , and have a good time . ' According to John " Whitey " Maher , who fought for the Orange as a lightheavyweight in the early 1950s , the word got out in 1951 that Crandell had a " glass jaw , " and after that most of the heavyweight 's fights were slugging matches with the goal of landing the first effective punch since Crandell himself could hit so hard . " After Crandell 's 1949 tournament victory over Schaffer , Louisiana State had twenty points , Michigan State had eighteen , the total for San Jose State was seventeen , Idaho had thirteen , and Minnesota had eleven to close out the leaders ' group . Financially the tournament was considered a success by Michigan State athletic business manager L. L. Frimodig and gave a real boost to boxing at East Lansing since it drew many people to Jenson Fieldhouse who had not watched college boxing prior to the tournament . ' But the tournament had not been as well attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred were present at the afternoon session on April ? and about 3,000 came out for that evening 's bouts . " On the April 8 the semifinals drew about 3,700 , ' and 7,000 appeared for the finals on April 9 . " The caliber of boxing in 1949 appeared to be at a high level , with strong competitors from all sections of the country participating at East Lansing as sixty-one athletes from seventeen institutions vied for titles.60 The EIBA had sponsored another successful tournament prior to the nationals , with Syracuse and Virginia winning the most individual championships and the Orange the team trophy.61 The Southern Invitational Tournament ; more popularly referred to as The Dixie Tournament , had replaced the Southern Conference Tournament and had been won by Louisiana State.62 The University of Idaho had won the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Boxing Association Tournament , and while the third Intermountain Intercollegiate Tournament had taken place none of its champions had competed at East Lansing.63 Increasing Interest in boxing at two-year colleges had resulted in the first national tournament sponsored by the national Junior College Athletic Association , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pacer , Pasadena , San Francisco , John Muir , Ventura , and Allen Academy in California and McNeese in Louisiana . " The 1949 NCAA tournament had represented the first year Louisiana State won a national team title and the first time the University of Minnesota had captured an individual championship . Boxing was started at Minnesota when Ray Chisholm , a welterweight at the University of Wisconsin in 1936 , 1937 , and 1938 , transferred to the Gopher campus in 1939 with the desire to study forestry . The year he transferred Chisholm became director of intramural boxing at Minnesota , and he held that post until he graduated and joined the Coast Guard in 1942 . He returned to Minnesota when he was discharged from the service in 1946 and started an intercollegiate boxing program there in 1947 . Although he was highly respected among his coaching colleagues , boxers , and officials associated with the sport , he never received any substantial support from the athletic administration of his university . He produced some outstanding boxers and his teams fought some of the most competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his efforts to publicize boxing was apparently a major factor in boxing home contests never drawing more than 2,500 spectators for a match , with the average attendance per home dual meet engagement at 869 in 1947 , 1,290 in 1948 , and 949 in 1949 . The situation did not improve for Minnesota boxing , as far as administrative support and attendance were concerned , as the 1950s began . The initial years of that decade saw the application of a relatively new technology to the communication of boxing activity to the general public , and this development was significant in terms of the future of college boxing . To begin the discussion of how the application of a new technology to sport affected college boxing , it should be emphasized that the technology has had a profound influence on how information is communicated and processed in both cognitive and emotional domains . Radio and the printed word are responsible for certain interpretations , reactions , and conclusions in the people who hear and read the messages they convey . In the late 1960s printed word and audio messages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoking analysis of the impact of various media . McLuhan was especially concerned with the way television affected viewer ideas and emotions in contrast to the impact of radio-delivered messages . ' The significance of the visual dimension of the television message became especially important in the history of college boxing when the technology related to the manufacture of television sets reached a point at which it was economically feasible for a broad range of people to afford these sets and professional boxing became a popular subject for telecasting . Radio broadcasts of professional boxing contests had been going on for a number of years , but Don Dunphy and Bill Corum 's descriptions of the action required experience on // the part of the listener to grasp the significance of the violence that was taking place . With television , that experience was not necessary since the picture was there directly and did not have to be formed in the mind . Affordable television and network telecasting of boxing took the sport into the living rooms of America . The Wednesday and Friday night professional boxing live telecasts from such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached millions and made an impression . Those telecasts carried the image of the clean-cut Chuck Davey with his college professor appearance to a general public that had never heard of intercollegiate boxing . However , the positive aspects of the science demonstrated in Davey 's precise right jabbing and left hooking were overshadowed by the shock of quick knockouts and the violence and pain associated with the bloodshed and batterings that also came through clearly on the iconoscope.67 In the long run the bloodshed , pain , and violence characteristic of the professional ring were to become contributing factors in the undoing of college boxing , as television viewers with any awareness that the sport had a collegiate dimension failed to differentiate between what was taking place on the television screen before them in their living and family rooms and what was going on in the college ring . While Chuck Davey was becoming the darling of Wednesday and Friday night TV fight fans , the Spartan boxers at his alma mater made another valiant effort for the national team title that had eluded them before their homecrowd backers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an Eastern setting  - -  State College , Pennsylvania . There was a national champion entered in every weight division but one as the thirteenth annual NCAA tournament commenced in Penn State 's Recreation Hall on March 30 , 1950.66 The field was strong , although perennial contender Virginia had been banned from competition because the University was said to have violated the Principles for the Conduct of Intercollegiate Athletics drawn up by the NCAA in 1946 . The Principles , more frequently referred to as the Sanity Code , specified that athletes meet the same academic standards as all other students , that athletic ability should not be a consideration in awarding financial aid , and that institutions should not recruit athletes through the inducement of financial aid . The Code was first enforced in 1948 but was repealed in 1951 because of its divisiveness among NCAA institutions . However , Virginia 's violations in football led to preclusion of Cavalier athletes from NCAA tournament competition , and the boxing team was affected.69 Fifty-six men from sixteen colleges and universities competed for titles in a tournament climaxed by dramatic developments in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excelled those of the previous year 's meet in East Lansing . In extremely heated competition highlighted by numerous split // decisions , not one injury ( major or minor ) occurred , prompting NCAA Boxing Rules Committee chair Bleckwenn to report to the NCAA membership and the intercollegiate sportsworld that the tournament was a huge success . Nearly every entry was a champion or runner up in his regional or conference competition . The contests were all very close as attested to by the many split decisions . Not a single injury , major or minor , was sustained . No contestant was knocked out during the Tournament . In spite of all the gory overly dramatic and vicious attacks on this sport , college boxing can not be said to resemble the activities described in these denunciations of the professional side of " prize fighting . " Rather than enter the controversy with the rabid anti-boxing proponents who have held the limelight in several articles appearing in national magazines , our committee has decided against making a response to the attack which is made primarily on the professional area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that college boxing differed from the professional ring activity , essentially because the health and safety of participants was the foremost concern of collegiate officials , boxers in the tournament were used as subjects for the University of Wisconsin medical study of boxing . Brain waves of the competitors were measured with the electroencephalograph before and following their bouts . " One of the pioneers of college boxing , who had a strong interest in the study and had made a lifetime commitment to ensuring that the sport on an intercollegiate basis would not succumb to problems associated with prizefighting , died on January 21 , 1950 . The college boxing world was deeply saddened by the death of Leo Houck . The thirteenth annual NCAA tournament was dedicated to the Penn State coach who had stressed courage , fair play , friendship , and the left jab.n Two Penn State representatives were in the finals , but even if both could win the Nittany Lions would need to see some real upsets in other bouts to have any chance at the John J. Walsh Trophy . Entering the final evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds-on favorite to win the team title as captain Henry Amos at 125 pounds , lightheavyweight Chuck Spieser , and heavyweight Gabriel Marek were all in contention for championships . A win by any one of the three would assure the Spartans of at least a tie for the Walsh Trophy and team honors . But the aggressive and superbly conditioned Marc Martinez , who had eliminated Wisconsin 's Steve Gremban in the semifinals , outscored Amos and put a slight damper on // Michigan State 's hopes in the evening 's first bout . ' The San Jose State featherweight , who had become a favorite with Rec Hall spectators because of his eager participation in free-swinging exchanges in his tournament appearances , had been a spirited competitor throughout his boxing career . His first boxing was at Modesto Junior College , where he had enrolled after serving with the 15th Armored Division in the European Theater of Operations in World War II . From Modesto it was San Jose State and the compilation of a highly impressive ring record.74 Martinez , a deeply religious person who has dedicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the education of youth from what he considers a Christian perspective , has specialized in teaching history and Spanish , in coaching swimming , and in administration . He has taught and coached at junior and senior high school levels and served as a community junior college administrator . In the early 1960s he and his wife codirected a university Christian student center in Guatemala . When asked if there was any relationship between his survival and his success in his varied career pursuits and his college boxing experience , he stated , I learned from boxing that if you want to win , you must give it all the preparation possible . You must train hard on the fundamentals , you must know your opponent and you must never overestimate yourself or underestimate your opponent . The experience put me in contact with many people in and out of the ring . I began as a very reticent and unsure individual but because these people gave me some worth , I began to believe that I really was worth something . I 'm convinced to this day that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boxing and people associated with the sport helped him to develop self-confidence contradicts the theory advanced by a number of sports psychologists that athletic competition does not really build confidence and assertiveness but rather that sports attract persons who already have those traits.76 Martinez has spoken of being frightened before every bout and has said that it was only the exchange of jokes between his teammates Jim Nutt and Wayne Fontes in the locker room prior to his fights that diverted him from his fears , made time pass , and enabled him to enter the ring . He has remembered that Frankie Echevarria from Idaho and Jackie Melson from Washington State were the two opponents who most filled me with terror before the match . Although I was frightened // before every match , I 'm still amazed that I actually stepped into the ring with them . Before each match I vowed that I was going to quit but after it was over I got new courage . It was such a pleasure to react with my opponents and with other boxers and boxing fans that I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Milt Pastor in the 1950 NCAA tournament because he regarded the Louisiana State featherweight of " the perfect boxer-puncher , " but Martinez had his most difficult time in bouts with Echevarria because Frankie had combinations that would n't quit , whereas my forte was excellent condition . We were always even to the last half of the third round . Whenever I was in better condition I would win and when I was n't his jabs and left hook would catch up to me . We took turns being winners . ' An indication of Martinez 's prowess in the ring is that two national champions , W. O. Moss79 and Frank Echevarria , 80 both considered the skillful Spartan as the best they faced in college . A man who relied on the same kind of stamina , courage , and ability to punch that Martinez displayed was the next winner in the 1950 NCAA finals . But defending 130-pound champion Tad Thrash 's margin of victory was far less than that of the San Jose State champion . And the circumstances under which he gained the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first round began , Thrash and his opponent , Andy Quattrocchi of Maryland , butted heads . Apparently the Louisiana State boxer 's headgear was riding too high on his forehead and he sustained a cut that caused referee Gene Rankin to terminate the bout . The two judges were split in their opinions as to the winner , and Rankin 's vote for Thrash decided the contest ! ' Ironically , it had been Thrash 's opponent in the previous year 's finals who had suffered a head laceration . It will be recalled that Norm Walker received a cut on his right temple in that contest in the second round and lost a unanimous decision to the Bayou Tiger . ' Fighting at 135 pounds in the 1950 nationals , Norm Walker had been eliminated in the quarter-finals , and it was Ev Conley of Washington State and Paul Kostopoulos of Maryland who battled for the championship trophy in the lightweight division . In what he views as his finest intercollegiate performance , Conley ( an outstanding athlete referred to by Ike Deeter as " a quiet individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand quickness " ' ) clearly outboxed Kostopoulos to gain a unanimous decision and the first NCAA title for // the Cougars since Dave Knight won in the same weight class in 1943 . " The talented southpaw from Everett , Washington , who repeated as the 135-pound NCAA champion in 1951 and was awarded the John S. LaRowe Trophy on that occasion , compiled a remarkable record in amateur boxing . Starting at age ten or eleven and winning a Washington State Golden Gloves Senior Division championship when he was sixteen , Conley had 256 wins against six losses when he hung up the gloves for the last time . As a collegian he was 63-3 and won a number of Spokane Invitational , Inland Empire , and Pacific Coast titles in addition to his two national championships.8S Conley , who was inducted into the Washington State University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1984 and had served in various leadership capacities with the YMCA for twenty-nine years at the time of his induction , coached the First Infantry Division boxing team as one of his assignments as an Army officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inducted into the Washington State University Athletic Hall of Fame , Conley expressed these feelings about his involvement in boxing : It gave me a real feeling of respect for people and built a certain amount of self respect and confidence . Boxing also provided me with a feeling of accomplishment ... . If it had not been for NCAA boxing , I am sure the opportunity of working for the YMCA would not have been possible . I really feel indebted to NCAA boxing and the people who helped me along the way.87 It was not many minutes after Conley won his first national title that Len Walker gained his second NCAA crown . Competing now in the 145-pound weight class , the Wallace , Idaho ring craftsman beat a tough , previously undefeated EIBA champion when he took a split decision from Ben Dolphin of Syracuse . In a bout fought cautiously at long range most of the time because of the respect the contestants had for each other 's ability , Walker " proved too clever for hard-punching Ben Dolphin , " was awarded the decision , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another contestant from the West triumphed at 155 pounds and contributed immensely to his team 's score in the race for the Walsh Trophy . Eli Thomas , the Pacific Coast champion from Spokane 's Gonzaga University , decisioned Pat Heims of Penn State and ended a Cinderella experience for the Nittany Lion competitor.69 Heims , a replacement for Lou Koszarek who did not want to get down to the 155-pound weight limit , had fought in only two intercollegiate bouts prior to the tournament , winning one and losing the other.90 In the tournament one of Heim 's wins was over Dick Murphy of Wisconsin . Murphy , one of the pretournament favorites , had himself upset The Six-Minute Fraternity i Connel , Minnesota 's 1949 NCAA champion , before the Badger 's final contest with Helms . " In the finals Thomas proved to have too much muscle and ring savvy he courageous but inexperienced Heims . The Gonzaga boxer 's aggressive s , strength , and excellent body punching were overpowering , and he won ar decision over the surprising Helms . ' Thomas 's title was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had refereed many NCAA lament bouts but had never tutored a champion . Thomas , in more recent years the owner of an exclusive men 's clothing in San Jose , has expressed the opinion that August had the most extensive vledge of boxing of anyone he has known . Moreover , he believes August especially adept at conveying that knowledge to his boxers . Thomas , who t with the August family while attending Gonzaga , had been encouraged by ) oxing success of two older brothers to become involved in the sport . That participation was in the Catholic Youth Organization program in his etown of Butte , Montana . Thomas reflected on the role boxing has played is life and commented that boxing " has taught me a lot about working with ' le . " He believes more can be learned about a person in a few minutes in ing with him than by working with him " side-by-side " for a lifetime . That experience provides an excellent measure of a person 's determination , petitiveness , " and his ability to counter under pressure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow competitively . It makes you realize that in order to do your best , it depends on something greater than you are . And it gives you a concern for your fellow man and teaches you to not purposely cause permanent injury to an opponent . Bottomline , it teaches you moral responsibility . ' At the time that Thomas expressed these views , he also stated that his rience as a member of the California State Athletic Commission in the ) s has influenced his thinking on the morality of boxing . Work on that emission , which is responsible for licensing boxers and their protection as as the protection of the consumer , has shown Thomas the difficulty of ng managers , trainers , doctors , conditioners , and inspectors to move toward ; common aim of ensuring competitiveness and protecting the health and safety articipants . On this subject Thomas explained , I had been fortunate enough to have had the experience of the sport of boxing without obtaining permanent injury . While in my last year at Gonzaga , I was asked to write a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time I had defended the sport . Today , and after being on the California State Athletic Commission , and after the many deaths that have occurred in the ring the last five years , I am not so sure I can defend the sport any longer . I believe professional boxing , and even amateur boxing , that does not have in mind the protection of the boxer and the consumer , has become an immoral sport.44 The man who won a 1950 national title at State College right after Thomas accomplished that objective also had involvement in boxing after his last intercollegiate contest . Herb Carlson served as a referee for a number of matches in the 1950s , but on the evening of April 1 , 1950 he was a principal and turned in what he considered to be his finest collegiate boxing performance against Jim Rollier of Syracuse at 165 pounds . " Rollier , the EIBA champion in 1948 , 1949 , and 1950 and a masterful boxer , regarded Carlson 's statement on that bout as being the highest of personal compliments because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport 's history . " For three years Carlson had carried the reputation of being one of college boxing 's most devastating punchers , and his capabilities as a boxer had been of secondary importance . However , that night against Rollier he demonstrated that he could box and so impressively that he was awarded the John S. LaRowe Trophy , and his victory over Rollier was classified in some quarters as " an artistic whipping . " Carlson won the LaRowe Trophy , but the bout that was considered the highlight of the tournament was the one that followed his engagement with Rollier . The 175-pound championship bout had double significance for both Chuck Spieser and Carl Maxey . A win not only meant an individual trophy for the victor , but if Spieser won Michigan State had the outright team championship , and if Maxey came out ahead Gonzaga had a chance to tie for the team title . Maxey and Spieser were the survivors in one of the most competitive lightheavyweight fields in tournament history . On the way to the fmals Maxey had defeated three-time NCAA tournament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken a close decision from defending titlist Carl Di Bernardo in the semifinals . ' If performance against a common opponent was any criterion , Spieser was the favorite since he had beaten Grant Butcher in the finals of the 1948 Olympic tryouts , " while Maxey had lost to Butcher in the Western Regional Boxing tournament that determined that area 's lightheavyweight representative in the Olympic tryouts.10 ? The Maxey-Spieser bout was superbly fought by both men , and Gene Rankin has remembered Maxey 's victory as the " most masterful piece of boxing " he has ever seen.1 " The New York Times reported that // Maxey provided the biggest upset when he earned a decision over Spieser by about the slenderest margin , one point . Two judges gave one-point margins to Maxey , while the third voted the other way . It was the tall Gonzaga Negro 's short , accurate counterpunching in the third round that swayed the decision . He clipped Spieser three or four times and was quick to follow this advantage with flurries of body punches.102 Maxey , undefeated as a collegian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lost only to Maxey during his distinguished collegiate career , was the toughest man he faced in the college ring , and that he waged the best battle of his life against the Spartan.103 According to Maxey , coach Joey August ( in his instructions before that battle ) said of the Spartan that when he 's advancing he 's like a hungry tiger ! When he 's retreating he looks like Tony Zale . He 's about the best college boxer in the nation . . . . Now go out there and get him ! 104 Maxey , who had passed up the 1949 NCAA tournament to concentrate on his academic work , picked up his first boxing experience when he was being raised by Jesuit priests at the Sacred Heart Indian Mission in DeSmet , Idaho . Orphaned from age two , he lived at the Spokane Children 's Home until he was eleven , and for the next four years his education and development were under the guidance of the Jesuits at Sacred Heart Mission.105 It was during that four-year period that he fought against representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ athletes from Catholic Youth Organization clubs.106 He did not box in high school but participated in football , basketball , and track . Enrolling at Gonzaga in 1942 , he fought seven bouts before joining the Army in 1943 , where he received a battlefield commission in the Medical Service Corps . After his discharge in 1946 he enrolled briefly at the University of Oregon on a track scholarship but was back at Gonzaga shortly to pursue a law degree.107 While studying law his daily schedule included , in addition to two and a half hours of study and three hours of class attendance , four hours working as a janitor in a liquor store and two and a half hours working out with the University 's boxing team.10B The drive , energy , and commitment that enabled Maxey to meet the demands of that schedule have carried over in his life after college as he has become one of the top criminal lawyers in the Northwest , if not the entire country . He has been listed among the best lawyers in America ; has been a peace activist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in liberal causes ; and has been appointed by five different presidents to the position of // Washington State chair of the United States Civil Rights Commission.109 He has credited his boxing experiences with teaching him some important lessons about life : Boxing teaches you to take care of yourself and have selfconfidence . You also learn it is a treacherous , prejudiced sport full of all the hazards of the real world . For example , I carried half the people I fought to keep our program respectable . Nobody carried me . I must make the observation that in four years of collegiate boxing I never fought a black guy and never saw one in a major tournament in my weight class . The year I won the nationals they still had the CIAA ( Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association ) ; that says it all . Lastly , in 1943 , Gonzaga had a feeler to the Sugar Bowl Tournament  --  they probably could n't have afforded it anyway  --  but it could n't have been contemplated because black athletes were not allowed to appear in the Sugar Bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxing appear to be on target , it should be noted that Bill McMoore , an exceptionally quick-handed lightheavyweight from Minnesota and an African American , competed in that 1950 NCAA tournament when Maxey won his title . " " Gene Rankin has reported that Ray Chisholm canceled a match the Gophers had scheduled with Louisiana State University at Baton Rouge , because when confirmations came back on hotel reservations McMoore was listed as staying at a hotel other than where the rest of the team was to be quartered . " ' Maxey 's 1950 NCAA tournament win over Spieser still did not erase completely the Spartans ' chances for a share of the team title . A victory by Gabby Marek in the heavyweight final would give Michigan State sufficient points to tie Gonzaga and Idaho . And the Marek-Chuck Drazenovich championship bout was rated a toss-up . Although the Penn State heavyweight was the 1948 , 1949 , and 1950 EIBA titlist , Marek had shown his power with a second-round TKO win over defending champion Marty Crandell in the semifinals and that was after Marek had beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the finals the rugged Marek , a devastating puncher who had taken out 1948 national heavyweight champion Vito Parisi with one punch in a dual meet that year , " rushed Drazenovich and kept after him from the opening bell to the end of the bout . He threw swooping overhand rights and lefts with equal force . In the second round he altered his style briefly and jabbed . Reverting to his more aggressive approach , Marek slipped and fell to the canvas // as he attempted to move inside . No knockdown was ruled . Marek continued to charge , but Drazenovich held him off with a strong left jab and a right hook . Marek , after being slowed by a one-two combination from his Penn State opponent , landed two solid rights to the head and a good left that caused Drazenovich to hold on , with Marek coming out ahead in the exchange of left jabs at the bell . While Marek staggered Drazenovich with an explosive right in the third round , the Nittany Lion countered with a couple of hard right hooks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punches at the bell . " ' Drazenovich , who seemed to impress the judges because he was a bit larger and stronger than Marek , was awarded the decision , 16 but the verdict as in the Maxey-Spieser contest could easily have gone the other way . " ' This bout marked the high point of Drazenovich 's outstanding career , in which he won seventeen , lost five , and drew two.1 ' Drazenovich , who was an All American football center and linebacker and went on to play for the Washington Redskins , had never boxed before he tried out for the Penn State team . " ' Drazenovich 's win , while it shattered Michigan State 's hopes for its first ever NCAA team title , meant that Frank Young 's Idaho Vandals and Joey August 's Gonzaga contingent were cochampions of the tournament with eighteen points apiece . Michigan State finished with thirteen , Louisiana State and Penn State were next with twelve each , and San Jose State 's ten rounded out the leader 's group , with Washington State not far behind with eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first national team title at the same time that it had captured its first individual championships . Boxing had been an activity at that Jesuit institution since 1930 but was dormant for a number of years until 1939 , when it received a major boost . At that time Joey August , former Gonzaga and University of Idaho boxer who has a 14-1 record in the ring as a professional , was asked to put on a boxing " smoker " to raise money for the football team . That smoker revived interest and enthusiasm with respect to boxing . From 1943 to 1946 August coached and trained V5 and V7 Naval preflight candidates and V12 cadets . After World War II he continued to coach boxing and became one of the top referees in the country at the same time that his 1950 , 1951 , and 1952 teams gained national recognition . Gonzaga officially dropped boxing in 1953 , largely because Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Boxing Association rules that were put into effect precluded Gonzaga from drawing on Catholic Youth Organization boxing programs for its recruits.121 Gonzaga 's discontinuing boxing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be allowed to box in the collegiate ring . Eddie Sulkowski , the new Penn State boxing coach in 1950 , had some interesting observations on that subject . Sulkowski had been at Penn State since 1946 , serving as trainer and assistant to Houck . He had fought professionally and had engaged in 370 contests as an amateur in the flyweight division , winning a number of AAU and Golden Gloves championships . ' 22 // Sulkowski believed that the individual and not the number of amateur fights that individual had participated in prior to college enrollment should be the crucial factor in deciding who should be eligible to box in the college ring . If an individual was willing to abide by the collegiate rules and compete within the total spirit of college boxing , he should be allowed to participate . If a person 's ring behavior indicates that he can not follow the rules and he roughs up his opponents , fouling and using tactics frequently associated with the professional sport , he should not be allowed to compete . Sulkowski expressed the opinion that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter was not . ' 23 In support of what Sulkowski contended , it might be said that Ted Kara , Ben Alperstein , and Johnny Joca were boxers with extensive amateur experience prior to entering college who boxed just enough to win and did not attempt to destroy their opponents through rough , questionable tactics . They even may have " carried " opponents on several occasions . While coaching at Penn State from 1950 through the 1954 tournament , when the sport was dropped at the State College institution , Sulkowski actually preferred to develop boxers rather than do any extensive recruiting of men who had already demonstrated their skills through amateur involvement . He contacted boxers when they were brought to his attention by people in the field , and he only had eight scholarships to offer , scholarships that just covered tuition , which was about $250 at the time he was coaching . However , he assisted his boxers in finding room and board jobs . With respect to that area he reported , " I 'd get a break with fraternity houses because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observer when it came to the college boxing scene , Sulkowski was a valuable member of the coaches ' fraternity while Penn State had boxing teams in the early 1950s . ' ' The NCAA Boxing Rules Committee , with its continuous concern for the welfare of participants , announced toward the end of the 1950 nationals that it was working on a plan to eliminate brute strength and slugging as key factors " by placing a higher premium on skill and perfection in the art of boxing . " Rule changes had been offered that would minimize knockouts " by rendering power blows of no value or weight in scoring and which would extend to body blows the same scoring value now conferred on blows to the head and face . ' The Committee announced that the tournament , which was under the direction of Penn State 's H. R. Gilbert , had been a success with special note being , made of the fact that forty-three of the tournament 's forty-eight bouts had been decided by decision and thirty-three of those decisions were made by unanimous vote of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the nationals provided an indication that college boxing was surviving rather well in spite of the continued and even increasing opposition to the sport . Seven regional tournaments had been held prior to the State College nationals , the Southern California Junior // College Boxing Tournament took place at Pasadena City College about the same time that the NCAA was going on , and the National Junior College Boxing Tournament was conducted on April 10 through 12 in Ogden , Utah . ' ' The Eastern Intercollegiate Boxing Association 's twenty-seventh annual meet was held at the State Fair Coliseum in Syracuse and was won by the Orange12S ; the Southern Invitational saw team honors go to Louisiana State ' ' ; 11,650 people watched the three-day competition of the Pacific Coast Intercollegiate Boxing Association Tournament , in which forty boxers vied for championships and Idaho took the team title130 ; and the growing Intermountain Intercollegiate Boxing Tournament drew thirty-two men from eleven colleges and universities and attracted 8,000 spectators to its two nights of boxing . Idaho State was the team champion in this event , which saw former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way from Chicago to compete with the Bengals and other Western teams from the University of California , Santa Clara , San Francisco State , Nevada , California State Polytechnic University , Ricks College , Southern Idaho College of Education , Eastern Washington College of Education , and junior college power , Compton . Dubby Holt 's promotional talents were beginning to expand the vistas of the Intermountain tournament , and developments at Pocatello portended the impact he was to have on the national collegiate boxing scene just a few years later . Part of Holt 's action in building the Intermountain tournament and his own boxing program was the establishment of a relationship between Idaho State and Compton College . The Junior College was to furnish him with his two most famous boxers , 1952 Olympic gold medal winner Hayes Edwin Sanders and outstanding professional middleweight Ellsworth " Spider " Webb.131 Sanders participated in both the Intermountain tournament and the second annual National Junior College Boxing tournament , losing his first bout in the former and taking the heavyweight championship in the latter . Webb won the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was entered by boxers from eleven institutions.132 Thirteen of the sixteen members of the Colored Intercollegiate Athletic Association entered the CIAA 's boxing tournament at Washington , D.C. , and Howard University repeated as team champions.133 Rounding out the regional tournaments reported in the Official National Collegiate Athletic Association Boxing Guide that covered the 1950 season were the Southern California Regional Junior College Boxing Tournament , in which both Ed Sanders and Spider Webb won titles , Pasadena was the team winner , and Compton , Bakersfield , Muir , and Pasadena were entries ; the Northwest Intercollegiate Boxing Tournament at Superior , Wisconsin ; and the Far Western Conference Boxing Championships , which took place at Chico State.134 The Northwest tournament , first held in 1941 , repeated in 1942 , but not revived until 1948 , drew thirty-three men from six institutions in 1950 . It had
