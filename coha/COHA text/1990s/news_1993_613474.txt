<p> Old-timers at WRFG radio can recall the night that reggae disc jockey Mike Gandy locked out New Age music host Ken Berman , partly because he did n't like the guy 's taste in tunes . <p> " He tried to push through me , " says Mr. Gandy , the dreadlocked fan often seen leading cheers from the stands at Hawks games . " I did n't want to fight or anything like that , but if I was n't 6-2 and 205 ... " <p> So goes the ferment at WRFG-FM ( 89.3 ) , the last blossom from that great flowering of late- ' 60s Atlanta anarchy , where the debate over politics and music can veer from cerebral jousting to a shoving match . And that 's just behind the microphones . <p> What comes out over the air is even weirder . Where else will you hear such musical selections as " Stinking Peanut Butter Love " and " How to Play Bongos " ? Where else could budding banjo players jam , by telephone , with on-air musical guests ? Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " international war criminal " ? <p> Despite its somewhat irregular 24,300-watt signal , this spunky little David has persevered for 20 years in a city full of radio Goliaths by programming roots music such as zydeco , reggae and bluegrass ( unavailable elsewhere on the dial ) , by courting listeners other ignore and by promoting incendiary talk . <p> Now the Federal Communications Commission has granted WRFG permission to boost its signal to equal the most powerful FM stations in town - in other words , to enter the big time . <p> But is the big time ready for Radio Free Georgia ? To some , giving WRFG 100,000 watts of broadcast power is like supplying Ken Kesey 's Merry Pranksters with the hydrogen bomb . <p> " It 's kind of like Jurassic Radio , " says David Chamberlain , host of the western swing program " Sagebrush Boogie " ( " by , for , and about rednecks " ) . " It could be unleashing something really dangerous - the suburbs maybe could n't bear it . " <p> The suburbs would hear brave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ host broadcast 30 minutes of a phonograph needle bumping the end of a record , just to see if anybody was listening . ( They were n't . ) <p> They 'd hear a variety of languages ( WRFG has broadcast in Khmer , Spanish , Korean and Indian ) and a diverse group of opinions , reflecting a multicultural volunteer force of more than 200 people who work together in sometimes uneasy proximity . " I never met a woman who did n't shave under her arms until I went down there , " jokes Jeff Mosier , former host of the bluegrass show " Born in a Barn . " <p> Conflict never discouraged the deeply dedicated volunteers from hauling in their own record collections week after week to create seat-of- the-pants radio , funded with 1/10th the budget of rival nonprofit station WABE-FM ( FM 90 ) . <p> But lately the debate has turned grim , setting black against white in an unfortunate parody of the station 's original rainbow-coalition- style philosophy . <p> A group of African-American airshifters ( hosts ) , banded together under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the station by playing the recorded speeches of black nationalists with extreme views about Jews and homosexuals . <p> " There 's a lot of gay-bashing in the name of Afro-centrism , " says Alicia Banks , who hosts a late-night show for black lesbians , Les Chanteuses Africaines . Ms. Banks is something of a renegade Griot in that she supports the black nationalist cause , but objects to " the anti-white , anti-Jew stuff . " <p> Tensions reached a high point when a Griot airshifter named Nma Chukwuesika broadcast a tape of a speech by Chicago figure Steve Cokely that spoke of the " beastly nature of the Jewish people . " The Cokely tape angered some volunteers at WRFG and at least one listener , who complained in writing . <p> " The ' beastly nature of the Jewish people ' - it 's a hate statement , it makes no distinctions at all , " says longtime airshifter Adam Shapiro , host of Wednesday night 's handicapped affairs program " Capped But Able . " <p> " Any derogatory mention of an ethnic group should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director Tom Davis . Ms. Chukwuesika 's program , " The Progressive Spot , " was moved off the air temporarily , although Mr. Davis says it was not in retribution , but because of a format change . <p> But Bomani Bakari , host of a jazz and information show called " ' Round Midnig ht " and co-president of the Griots , charges Mr. Davis and program committee chairman W.S. Tkweme with trying to censor black programming . <p> While hostilities have escalated , the casualties mount . After 19 years of stewardship , co-founder Barbara Joye left the station a year ago . " I got tired of it , " says the former board member . " I spent a year trying to get the board to respond , to enforce the policy against broadcasting material that promoted racism ... It was a relief for me , to let other people deal with that for a while . " <p> Yet WRFG 's board delayed dealing with the issue . After Ms. Joye left the station , the board waited a year before convening . Board members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these have yet to be scheduled . <p> " Ninety percent of the board ought to be replaced , " says board member and co-founder Fay Bellamy-Powell . <p> Ms. Bellamy-Powell , who is also a member of the Griots , insists , however , that nobody " can tell them what to say and how to say it about the racism that has been perpetrated against black people . " <p> In the meantime , the station continues with a new weekday format called World Party , which bumped bluegrass off weekday afternoons two years ago in an effort to capture a young black audience , further alienating some white airshifters . Now some of the board members who voted for it say that World Party programming is a disappointing simulation of commercial radio . <p> " I call it New World Radio , " says Mr. Bakari dismissively . <p> " It mostly boils down to kind of tired R &; B from the ' 70s , " says Mr. Chamberlain . <p> Mr. Davis , who became executive director three years ago , vigorously disagrees . He helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radio-sponsored experiment called the Blueprint Project , intended to help " underachieving " community stations . But APR pulled out a year ago , citing lack of cohesion at WRFG , and some say the director 's job is in jeopardy . <p> Mr. Davis shrugs , saying most executive directors do n't last more than two years anyway . " I 'm already past my life expectancy . " <p> If these are particularly perilous times for the listener-sponsored radio station , WRFG has always been a high-wire act . In its first broadcast year , beaming from a 10-watt " hamster-powered " transmitter , WRFG was investigated by local police for " subversive " activity and was shut down by WQXI-FM , now WSTR-FM ( Star 94 ) , , which owned the tower where the signal originated . WRFG regrouped by erecting a pole on top of its headquarters , in the back of a Euclid Avenue greasy spoon , and under cover of darkness created its own jerry-built antenna . <p> " You never knew from day to day whether the station would be on the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Folk , " who works days as a producer at the buttoned-down AM talk-radio station WGST ( News Radio 640 ) . Besides noisy pigeons that occasionally burst through the studio 's acoustic tile ceiling to dive-bomb guests , there were problems with " airshifters not showing up because they were in jail . " <p> Triumphing over these disadvantages , the station created award- winning documentaries such as the 50-part " Living Atlanta " series . It also served as a vital link between authorities and the Cuban detainees during the uprising of prisoners at the Atlanta Federal Penitentiary in 1987 . <p> Ernesto Perez , host of the Spanish-language salsa and call-in show " Con Sabor Cubano , " used the airwaves to help talk the prisoners into releasing their hostages . WRFG 's role in resolving the crisis received national press , including a story from The Philadelphia Inquirer calling WRFG an " odd little station . " <p> It 's notable that while Mr. Perez was urging calm , other more radical hosts at WRFG were encouraging the detainees to continue the struggle . <p> Internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the volunteers are n't interested in taking part in the administration and its intrigues . " I 'd rather be tortured , " says " The Celtic Show " airshifter Candace Hassen . <p> Boyd Lewis , writer-producer at WABE , does n't think the expansion to 100,000 watts is likely to happen . " If you talk to any of the old-time WRFGers , they will all talk about a will to smallness ... WRFG will continue to operate on a couple of D-cell batteries and a straightened- out coat hanger . " <p> But board secretary Raj Chawla , host of " Music From India " on Friday nights , says he 's confident the station will resolve its current problems and raise the $ 200,000 needed for the power boost . " What I see is not a major crisis , " he says . " People disagree , they resolve their disagreements and life goes on .
