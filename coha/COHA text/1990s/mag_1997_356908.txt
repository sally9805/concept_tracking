There 's not much glamour in the Internet router business . The VCR-size boxes that weave computers into networks belong to the realm of techies . Late at night , when corporations sleep , " geek squads "  --  the human infrastructure of the information age  --  stuff routers into closets , under desks or anywhere out of sight . It is not a business that produces headlines . <P> It does , however , produce stock market rockets . Networking stocks have helped push the tech-laden nasdaq exchange to new highs , and Cisco Systems  --  a networker whose stock has risen more than 12,000% in the past seven years  --  is the Apollo of the group . Fund managers trip over themselves to predict how high Cisco stock , which closed last week at $67 , will be come Thanksgiving ( consensus : $85 ) . In the past six weeks the stock is up 50% . Analysts flock to industry conventions to predict a glowing future . <P> CEO John Chambers , 46 , attracts more groupies at trade shows than the Spice Girls on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Other than Andy Grove , the guys who manage Microsoft and maybe Lou Gerstner , there 's no better management than Chambers and Cisco . In any industry . " Cisco recently unveiled its latest eye-popping numbers  --  52% sales growth with gross margins reaching 65% . And the company pulled this off during a wrenching product transition . <P> Just as Microsoft and Intel achieved exponential growth by riding the revolution that put a computer on millions of desktops , Cisco hopes to dominate the business of connecting those PCs . Cisco 's routers and switches , which sort packets of information as they fly through the ether , are the guts of the Net . If you send E-mail from Tokyo to Buenos Aires , odds are it will pass a Cisco router . With close to 70% market share , Cisco owns the horses of the fastest-growing Pony Express in history . <P> For all its late promise , the firm was born into rather humble circumstances , the brainchild of husband and wife Stanford academics Leonard Bosack and Sandy Lerner , who were merely trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanford 's mainframes could crush even the most recalcitrant differential equations , they could n't pass messages . The mainframes spoke a different language from the desktops at the library , and so on . The solution : a wire-stuffed box that performed a kind of simultaneous translation , enabling IBM machines to talk to Digital machines , wife to send grocery list to husband . By 1990 , as the first hints of the Internet emerged , the company went public . The founding couple left , while Cisco began its sprint to stardom . <P> The credit for that record-setting pace goes to Chambers , an energetic West Virginian with a Kalishnikov for a mouth who plays only doubles when he takes to the tennis court , an extension of his desire to make Cisco into a team . Chambers is relentlessly customer focused and prodigiously paranoid . When Cisco loses a big order , Chambers rings the buying CEO to ask how he could improve . <P> Chambers learned those lessons at IBM and Wang Laboratories , successful companies that staggered under the pressure of growth . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mark . " Everyone makes the same mistakes , " he says . " They get too far from customers and too arrogant . "
