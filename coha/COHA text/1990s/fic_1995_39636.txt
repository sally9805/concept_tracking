I KEEP A SAINT 'S EAR in a jewelry box , in my underwear drawer next to my bras and panties . It is a real human ear , not a hoax . I keep it in a small , white jewelry box , where it rests on a bedding of the purest white cotton balls . The cotton balls do not remain pure or white for long ; I have to replace them often , because I am always opening the lid of the jewelry box so I can look at the ear and touch it . I like the feel of the ear when I touch it . Sometimes I take the ear out of the jewelry box and lay it in the center of my palm . I enjoy the idea of how something can have gravity and mass and yet feel weightless . I feel the same way about the ear , when it is resting in the center of my palm , as I do when I am sitting at a table in a restaurant and lay a cloth napkin over my lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight in my lap . I like the faint pressure of the ear in the center of my palm . I enjoy it . <p> It is the ear of a saint . It is not a hoax . I have kept the ear with me for twenty-five years , during which time my daughter has grown into adulthood and has married , and has had two children , I believe . It was only last week the thought occurred to me that I had never asked myself whether it was a right ear or a left . I do n't know . It 's hard to tell . After all , the ear is a relic . It is hundreds of years old . I think it must be a left ear because of the way it folds and the creases that run through it . There is n't an opening . <p> I once forgot to put the ear back into my underwear drawer . By accident one morning , when I was getting dressed for work  --  I was standing there in my underwear , staring into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry box so I could look at the ear , I left the jewelry box on top of my bureau . I simply forgot it was there . Until I got home from work , that 's all I could think of . The entire morning  --  I work in admissions at Palms General , filling out insurance  --  all I kept asking myself was , How could I have been so careless ? I made myself sick . I had to go home before lunch . <p> That 's why I keep the ear in my underwear drawer , next to my bras and panties . It is in the second drawer of my bureau , and I keep the jewelry box in the front left corner of the drawer , where I also keep extra packages of L'eggs pantyhose ( petite , flesh tone , medium support ) just in case I run out . I do n't like running out of pantyhose . <p> I feel naked when I 'm not wearing any . And I wo n't wear them if there is even the slightest tear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever needing to shop for new panties and to throw out my old ones , but I wear my old panties anyway . I do n't know why . That 's just the way I am . <p> People who did n't believe it was a saint 's ear told me it did n't look like a human ear , that it did n't look like anything human . But after so many centuries , it would be silly to expect that it would . The ear has n't changed in my twenty-five years of handling it . It never looked like a dried mushroom . It never looked like a truffle , either . Because it is n't . <p> It is a small ear , and in life it must have been delicate , like an infant 's ear worn by an adult . The man it belonged to must have been as gentle as an infant . He was a Capuchin monk , and his remains were displayed in the reliquaries of the catacombs beneath the Capuchin monastery on the Via Barberini in Rome . <p> My former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together before we were married , John would say that I told my prayers to an apricot . He said this because I was Roman Catholic then . John said I prayed to a dried piece of fruit . John would ask , What prayer does a Catholic make to a dried piece of fruit ? Did I ask for a gift basket of apricots , expecting a multiplication like that of the loaves and fishes ? Sometimes he would say this in front of our daughter Haiphong/Jennifer when our daughter was in preschool . We would be at the kitchen table , and I would be going over Haiphong 's colored alphabet letters with her . John would ask if I had prayed to the apricot . We named our daughter after the destroyed city in North Vietnam . She was our love child . Our daughter was born at 5:16 A.M. , October 29 , 1972 . It was during the time of Richard Nixon 's illegal bombing of North Vietnam and Henry Kissinger 's phony peace plan that he sold to the country to get Nixon reelected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a saddle block , and then they wanted to take her out by cesarean , but I would n't let them . Haiphong was our affirmation of life . She was our love baby . <p> John renamed her after he won custody from me . <p> I have never forgotten her . Haiphong/Jennifer lives in a small town in Florida called Loxahatchee Groves . She is married to a man named Roger , who is an engineer for Pratt-Whitney , the jet engine manufacturer . Last year I heard that she had a little girl , which means she has two children now , a son and a daughter . <p> It is not an apricot . It is a saint 's relic . The ear was given to me when I was a student at Norbert College , when I attended the college 's Summer Art Institute in Florence . I was nineteen and still ironed my hair to straighten it . Magda was forty-nine and wore different , gaudy-colored wigs . She was dying of breast cancer . Name one artist who would turn her camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total realist . The ear is not a hoax . It is not an apricot . It does not look anything like an apricot . It is a saint 's relic , and I keep it in the second drawer of my bureau next to my bras and panties and my extra packages of L'eggs pantyhose . On the right side of the drawer , under my slips , I keep my signed copy of Magda 's last book . She named it after Salvador Dali 's painting , The Persistence of Memory . <p> The ear is not a hoax . I met Magda through Julian . He was my major instructor at Norbert . I was majoring in photography , and I was Julian 's lover . I did n't understand our relationship at the time  --  I was supposed to help Julian get through his second divorce , but I thought I was the reason for his divorce . I have found since that the facts of a person 's life are never as comprehensible to that person as the facts of another person 's life are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel out the truth and authenticity of the other . Julian 's daughter Christine , who also attended Norbert , certainly blamed me for her parents ' breakup . <p> Julian chose four of us to go to Florence : Michael in sculpture ; Lauri and Denise in painting ; me in photography . <p> Magda was Norbert College 's Summer Art Institute . The institute was her home , a stone farmhouse on a hillside outside of Florence . Magda was Julian 's friend , as was Eddie March , an American art preservationist who went to Florence when the city flooded in 1960 . Eddie March stayed . <p> The farmhouse was small , but it was connected by a wooden gallery to stone animal pens , a stone tower , and two low stone buildings that Magda called the granaries . These were working studios . The tower was the guest-house where we resident artists stayed . That was Norbert 's official designation for us , " resident artists , " for purposes of summer credit and government arts funding . The Institute , at least the resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed up the tower with an attached , enclosed Jacuzzi and sauna on the ground floor , and an American-size tiled pool out back . Every bedroom window in the tower looked out onto the most beautiful countryside  --  and they looked out onto Magda 's " animals " in their stone pens . Magda 's early career , what she made a name for herself in , especially in Milan and Berlin , was " junk art "  --  pieces that were like what Picasso did with the bicycle seat and turned-up handlebars that he turned into a bull . Or like what Duchamp did with his urinal/fountain . Magda had been inspired to create bestiaries . Some of the pieces were actual animals , or parts of them  --  goats , horses , oxen  --  which she got from slaughterhouses and reincarnated into art . I think Magda presaged Rauschenberg 's " walk around the block " motto concerning where art can be found  --  only her angora goat was n't splattered with paint and did n't wear a car tire around its middle like an inner tube that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its hind legs and wore a coffee can at the end of each horn , with a wooden box radio hanging by a thick metal chain from its neck . These and other early creations the museums allowed Magda to have back , so she could place them outside in the elements , in their pens  --  " weathering , " as Magda said , " becoming something else . " <p> I once tried , in 1986 , to explain Magda 's art at a protest rally in front of the Museum of Modern Art in New York . I was working as an art tutor with preschoolers in an antipoverty program on Jerome Avenue near where I was living in the Bronx . President Reagan was making it impossible for any of us to justify our funding . I 'm not kidding . When I was told I had no money to buy colored construction paper for the children , I went right upstairs to Cherrie Johnston 's office on the second floor and asked why . She said ketchup on the children 's hamburgers at lunch was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to have corn or peas with their hamburgers and fries , then I would have to do without construction paper . This was also the time when Jesse Helms was getting a lot of support in trying to do away with the National Endowment for the Arts , and not just from the reactionaries either . I felt cornered . I felt I could n't not say something . I took the subway down and walked over from the park , even though it was raining , and brought along Magda 's The Persistence of Memory . The one television crew there  --  I wo n't say what channel they were from , but they are still owned by the group that turned one of New York 's best newspapers into kennel liner  --  they thought they were going to have a field day with us  --  just a bunch of ratty-haired , overweight or anorexic women in wet coats and scarves , smelling like something the river washed up  --  well , I was n't going to let them get away with it . I held open the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camera , so the television boys could get a good look : Magda naked , full-frontal , after her second mastectomy ; Magda in closeup , flat as a washboard ; Magda 's beautiful face staring at her camera , asking , " What 's wrong with this picture ? " I tried to explain to them who Magda was , who she had been , how she had turned from one art to another  --  to photography  --  how she had given up wealth and fame to go to Central and South America to photograph women guerrillas . This was in the late 1950s and early ' 60s , before these movements had names like Sandinista and Shining Path . She went to photograph the women in those revolutions that Magda knew were always going on in Bolivia and Peru and Nicaragua . Then I held up her black-and-white glossies that no one would publish , of government soldiers who not only did n't object to the gringa taking pictures of them , but even welcomed and invited it : dead peasant women with their breasts cut off and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like sacks of lard or chicken parts , showing off their trophies ; government soldiers who were no older than little boys pointing their gun barrels into women 's vaginas . <p> I explained how after her years of defeat  --  and Magda told me that she felt defeated  --  she told me this as she held me in her arms when I was a nineteen-year-old in Florence and I found out Julian and Lauri had become lovers  --  I tried to explain how Magda later turned her camera lens on herself when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . It was these photos of Central and South America and herself that filled the living room of her villa and the wooden gallery that connected it to the resident artist tower , with its Jacuzzi and swimming pool and sauna : full-frontal black-and-white glossies of Magda naked , closeups of her , from below the waist , parting her labia , looking at her organs ( one of the things that we talked about in bed one night was how , as girls , we are trained never to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but how is it that we still get the message ? ) ; Magda from the waist up , dozens of them , raising her left arm , her right hand cupped under her left breast , which is n't there , after her first mastectomy ; then Magda after the second , the same poses , but the field of view tightening until the pictures look like photographs of nothing or like an abstraction , maybe resembling a white sheet on an unmade bed , just flatness and creases  --  and the subscript under the last photo , which is a nude of Magda at eighteen when she tried to break into modeling and ended up in Garters and Hose ( she laughed when she told me ) , the subscript reading , " What 's wrong with this picture ? " <p> I wish I could say that after I appeared on television some people listened ; that when I went back to my classroom the next day my coworkers did n't wonder ; that when I sat down at the children 's little tables and went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color the sheets in their workbooks , that Cherrie Johnston did n't come down from her office and say to herself , " What 's wrong with this picture " <p> I was the same person . I took turns sitting with each of the children and had them show me how to put the real money into little piles  --  ten bright copper pennies ; two glistening , silvery nickels , one shiny dime  --  and then how to color and cut out the pictures of the coins in their workbooks . But something was wrong with the picture . I was in it . That 's why I was fired . <p> I wish I could say that I loved Magda on sight , when I first met her , and for all the right reasons . I did n't . I was nineteen . I had never been attracted to a woman , and this one I did n't know if I even liked . I went into her bed that night because I wanted to be comforted  --  because Julian had betrayed me . Julian was sleeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew it would happen  --  and did n't want to know  --  from the first afternoon when all of us , Michael and Lauri and Denise and me , went skinny-dipping in Magda 's pool . Magda and Julian and Eddie March sat naked on their lawn chairs and drank gin and tonics . <p> Julian threw his lime into the pool just as Lauri and I were about to dive . Then we all made a game of it , the three of us girls diving over and over for the lime slices that Julian threw into the pool , so Julian could watch our asses go into the air as we dove . He could n't take his eyes off Lauri 's . <p> I wanted to be comforted , bur not just about Julian . I told Magda how my parents were killed in a car accident when I was three and how I was raised by my mother 's sister , Ceil . She was a good guardian , but I had turned out badly . That night , Magda gave me the saint 's ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benedict of the Capuchin order in Rome , where there is still a monastery . <p> In the morning , I told Julian about Magda 's gift , and that I understood about him and Lauri . Julian only said that Magda had more preserved body parts under glass than Lenin 's mausoleum . <p> But it is a real saint 's ear . It is not a hoax . Touching it , I feel as if I am touching someone I have loved . <p>
