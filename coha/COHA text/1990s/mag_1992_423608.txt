Section : World report ; Cover story In a tiny village , the old ways still endure <p> Dateline : Nizhnaya Lipovka <p> In the Russian village of Nizhnaya Lipovka ( pop . 280 ) , women file into the tiny post office with care packages for their children in the cities  --  wooden mailing boxes filled with home-grown onions and potatoes . Pelagueya Betrayeva , a round woman with blazing blue eyes , bellows when she hears what it will cost to send food to her daughter in the Russian city of Tyumen : The cost of postage has doubled in the last year . Postmistress Olga Ichyotkina has more bad news : Betrayeva 's other parcel can not be delivered to newly independent Ukraine . No one can say why . <p> The people of this village in the heart of Russia , 450 miles southeast of Moscow , have grown accustomed to strange decrees from the outside world . There was the time the minister of forests ordered fruit orchards planted in Nizhnaya Lipovka . Any villager could have told him that while pine trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not . When the Communists established the first collective farms , 65-year-old Victor Pognayev recalls , they confiscated his father 's iron plow  --  the only one for miles around . The horses were taken from their masters , and they all died at the collective farm because no one took care of them , ' adds Lubov Tumanova , the retired postmistress . <p> Tumanova says those times remind her of today : leaders with inexperience making a lot of mistakes . Gradually , things got better , ' she says . But most villagers are doubtful . Victor measures Russia 's steady decline by the Singer sewing machine that has a place of pride in his two-room cottage . His father ordered it by mail from the factory at Padolsk , and the hand-turned machine was delivered just a month after it was ordered . The Bolsheviks shut down the Singer factory , and 75 years after the revolution , the old sewing machine remains the Pognayev family 's only valuable possession . <p> The people of Nizhnaya Lipovka still have outhouses in the barnyard , wood-burning stoves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must trudge at least 20 minutes to draw water . When the heavy snows come , she turns for help to the drunks who come to her door looking for vodka . She gives them a bottle for chopping her wood or bringing water . <p> At the onset of winter in early November , Victor Pognayev 's wife , Julia , usually buys 100 eggs to last her family of three until the thaw at the end of April . It is a modest ration , but this year she has n't been able to save enough money for such a big purchase . The villagers made less fruit preserves than usual because sugar is scarce and expensive . But they still make sure their animals are cared for . When a calf is born in winter , it is kept in the warmth of a peasant cottage until spring , when it no longer is in danger of freezing to death outdoors . Last winter , Victor and Julia 's calf chewed the wallpaper in their cottage . No one seemed to mind . <p> Despite the hardships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their neighbors watch television and they are shocked by what they see of city life . They tell their relatives : If things get worse , come to us . We will have enough . ' Such self-sufficiency appealed to Andrei and Svetlana Karabayev , who decided to leave Askhabad , Turkmenistan , a city in a Central Asian republic of the former U.S.S.R. After the collapse of the Soviet Union , the couple began to fear the rise of Islamic fundamentalism . They wanted to breathe clean air and live off the land . If you have a cow , you will feel safe , ' says Svetlana . If you are hard-working , you will have everything you need . ' <p> More Russians are coming to the village from cities in the former Soviet republics . Alexander Mochalov , a physics teacher , taught eighth graders in Tashkent who knew cybernetics . In Nizhnaya Lipovka , the students have a lot to learn . A group of 13-year-olds say they are n't sure how to describe the fading figure of Lenin . They take a guess : He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rural life in Russia has outlasted Lenin 's revolution , Stalin 's persecution and the ill-starred reforms of Nikita Khrushchev and Mikhail Gorbachev . Karl Marx , a city boy , condemned the idiocy of village life . ' Stalin called peasants scum , ' according to Khrushchev 's memoirs . The Communist state tried to make villages nothing more than worker settlements . Typically , a gun would be put to the landlord 's head and the farm workers would be told : Go to the factory or we shoot . ' They went , but the villages endured . <p> Now Boris Yeltsin is promising a free-market revolution , but change still comes hard to Nizhnaya Lipovka . Most villagers frown at the thought of selling what they produce . Making money off the land is something the Tatars do , the peasants say , referring to the Muslim ethnic minority that lives in several nearby villages . Svetlana Karabayeva admits that she once sold potatoes in Moscow , but she pleads : Please do n't let anyone in the village know . ' <p> For more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon become legal to buy land . In Srednaya ( Middle ) Lipovka , a village of 19 souls next door to Nizhnaya ( Lower ) Lipovka , Rimma and Victor Kuritsyn dream of owning their own land , but they remember how the Communists expropriated farms and they are afraid that history will repeat itself . Victor 's father , a prosperous landowner , was branded a capitalist kulak and lost everything after the revolution . I am afraid that if there is another coup or something , we will be considered kulaks again , ' frets Rimma . <p> Such fears are understandable . When an American journalist and photographer visited recently , a plainclothes security officer followed in their tracks , knocking on cottage doors to question their contacts . He told the villagers to keep silent , but within hours the word was out . With a spunk that is still rare in the former Soviet Union , Julia Pognayeva shrugged off any danger : Where can they send me ? I am already as far away as you can get .
