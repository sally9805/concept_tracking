MENCKEN // Of course , it was many decades ago that the Sage of Baltimore wrote these audacious words . So , good grief , what would poor Mencken say now on the subject ? Back then , three quarters of a century ago , when he was so exercised , golf had hardly intruded on the body politic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elite . People then actually used golf , the noun , as a verb . They golfed ( as they yachted and summered ) . // Today , surely , Mencken would be apoplectic , besieged as we all are by golf . Everybody , including a lot of rude , dclass people , plays golf . Moreover , I 've suspected for a long time that although there are more of them now , golfers remain a people apart  --  that , as Fitzgerald said about the very rich , golfers are different from you and me . Well , anyway , from me. // Golf has become an utter phenomenon , ubiquitous upon the earth ( especially the United States division ) , a dominant cultural force that has replaced most sensible , traditional American activities such as reading , the cocktail hour , sunbathing , worship of the Almighty , bridge and matinees. // Worse ( better ? ) , if Mencken 's proposed antigolf statute were enforced , the entire government and much of Wall Street would be disenfranchised . The New York Times has even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that the lower an executive 's handicap , the more successful he is as a businessman . It tells us a great deal that the pollsters , apparently assuming that all execs play golf , did n't even bother to check out the possibility that not playing golf would make an executive even better at business . But then , few bona fide serious Americans can , any longer , plead not guilty to golf . // How well I know . Occasionally , I am invited to play in some charity tournament . ( Perhaps you were n't aware that , nowadays , the entire eleemosynary structure in the U.S. rests on charity golf tournaments ; giving in America today is on the Golf Standard . ) When I reply that I am sorry , but I do not happen to play golf , the response is incredulity . It 's as if I have said that I am sorry , but I do not choose to have indoor plumbing in my house ; or I am sorry , but my hobby is flag burning . // It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have written , and still passionately believe , that a golf course is the most glorious thing that man and God have ever made together . Ah , you see , precisely because I do n't play , I do n't notice the rough . And I possess an actual golfing history : I caddied as a boy . I also have friends and family members who play golf , and at least a significant minority of them seem perfectly well-adjusted . I 'm not one of those angry triathlon or bodybuilding fanatics who put golf down as a travesty of exercise , a pseudo sport . No , I just choose not to play . // There 's a whole other world out there . Golfers find this notion unacceptable . In the U.S. today , if you do n't play golf , you must explain yourself . // This has all happened fairly quickly . Why , I can remember when all the beautiful people only skied . Now , in the manner of strip-mining , golf courses are being built on the fanciest mountains in Colorado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short irons rather like a sidehill badger . For a long time , too , I thought that the cathedrals of fin de sicle America were our sports arenas . However , I have come to believe otherwise : The monuments that will be remembered most from this time will be our golf courses , delicately carved out of the most prized earth even as the suburban citizen fights in vain for a small plot , in hopes there to raise a family . // But : priorities . Be honest  --  does America want houses or fairways in the 21st century ? There are now something like 100 golf courses that have been retrieved out of the desert around Palm Springs , almost 200 around Phoenix , all using enough water every day to keep the Brazilian rain forest from burning for another 37 years . // But all that seems to matter is that more land is gobbled up for golf courses so that more real estate agents can sell more condos overlooking more water holes to those flourishing new ethnics , the Golfer-Americans . No one  --  especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautionary tale that comes from Japan , where huge numbers of the 1,500 or so courses built in the last few years have gone belly-up . In Connecticut it took the charisma of Paul Newman and $500,000 in seed money from him to save 740 acres of open space from being imprisoned as yet another golf development . Of course , rarely does golf have to contend with such a tasteful and resolute eminence as Mr. Newman . // Rather , even as we have become more egalitarian as a society , the institution of golf has been awarded a free pass , been allotted a privileged place in our culture . Does n't anybody worry that the President of these United States spends obsessive hours on golf courses ( even in the depths of winter ) when he should be leading the free world ? You think Saddam Hussein is out practicing chip shots ? // Perhaps this merely tells us that we do n't really need a full-time president anymore . Just a First Golfer . Or maybe good golf is simply the symbol of what leadership requires today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to be able to ride a horse well , wielding a fancy saber at the gallop . No doubt the Clinton Memorial will show him slugging a fairway wood , eyes boldly fixed on the distant green . // Or is n't it interesting that at a time when America is so manic on the subject of fitness , our business and political leaders exercise by riding golf carts  --  notwithstanding that it has been documented that the calories burned up by playing 18 holes while using a cart can be replaced by consuming one ( 1 ) chicken McNugget dipped in barbecue sauce ? // But the fitness nuts are silent on the subject . I can only imagine that 's because they 're all up jogging in place and doing sit-ups at 4 a.m. as they wait in line to sign up for a late-afternoon tee time . // In fact , as near as I can tell , golf has risen above criticism . Even for those pledged to document it , golf is n't a sport so much as it is a sacred way of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including my colleague whose writing is located in the fairway on the back page of this magazine , will rag on just about every sport , but they 're all like li'l puppy dogs , whimpering verse , when it comes to the links . Just once before I die , I want to read one sportswriter with the courage to write , " F  --  - Amen Corner . " // You see , golf is what the range used to be , a homey place where never is heard a discouraging word . In fact , by law , there are only three things in golf that anyone is allowed to criticize : 1 ) the pin placements at the U.S. Open , 2 ) the rough at the U.S. Open , 3 ) Colin Montgomerie. // Sometimes , when I lie awake at night , all I can think is : What did poor Colin Montgomerie do to deserve this ? Oh , well . // But if there 's no criticism allowed in golf , there is this compensatory sociological curiosity : all  --  all  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a celebrated comedy writer named Jack Winter , first pointed this out to me . Have you ever once heard a tennis joke ? he asked . A bowling joke ? A football joke ? In the entire history of comedy , there has never been a single hockey joke . Yet there are always golf jokes . A veritable plethora thereof . // I have given this a great deal of thought . There used to be many stupid jokes about fishermen . There are still a few hilarious fishing bumper stickers , such as I 'D RATHER BE FISHING . But no more fishing jokes . Golf jokes have overwhelmed them . Not only that , but now most of the hilarious sports bumper stickers are also about golf , like MY OTHER CAR IS A GOLF CART . // Even more bizarre , the law about golf jokes is that even though there are thousands of them , they can fall into one of only two categories . First are the magic golf jokes , wherein God , Moses , Saint Peter , et al . are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Second are the side-splitting **27;204;TOOLONG jokes . Golf jokes have no other roots , but the variations on the same two tired punch lines just go on and on . Maybe it 's because golf is becoming a form of religion , with its own liturgy. // What tells me that golfers are truly a different race , though , is the way they feel about golf balls . Golfer-Americans worship these inanimate objects quite unashamedly . By contrast , have you ever seen , for example , a bunch of normal American tennis players at the start of a match ? Balls ? Everybody says , " Who brought the balls ? Can we use this old can ? They 're still kinda fuzzy . " But Golfer-Americans are absolutely maniacal about their balls . They even attribute human qualities to them , in the same way that Disney anthropomorphizes animals . When a golfer hits a ball awry , he says , " My ball found the bunker , " as if this unhappy turn of events had nothing to do with who hit the ball , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free will . You ever hear a quarterback say , " My pass found the cornerback " ? Of course not . // Golf operates differently . It 's like one of those parallel universes that the starship Enterprise was always stumbling onto . Where 's Spock when we need him ? " Captain , huge numbers of chubby , oddly dressed humanoids seem to spend an excessive amount of time at massive outdoor temples where they speak to a small , pockmarked sphere . It is most peculiar for what seems to be , otherwise , such an advanced race . " // Oh , sometimes I have wondered how my life would have been if I , too , had played golf . I would have spent thousands of hours , hundreds of days , on the course instead of in the world . Nassaus , better balls , mixed foursomes , the driving range , the putting green . And gaily reliving it all at the 19th hole : male bonding . My vacations would have been planned around golf . My testicles would have grown demonstrably larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bertha as the only woman in my life . I would have found just the right ball for me . I would have addressed it . And I would have found all new friends . Joined select Golfer-American clubs , of course . Made blockbuster insider business deals in the locker room after a member-guest. // But probably , too , my life would have been much less productive . Let 's face it , the American Dream of most young men , circa 2000 , is to rush through life so they can retire and resettle in Dixie or in Irrigationiana , where they can play golf all year round , to the exclusion of all other pursuits . Really , now , is that the freedom that Sergeant York , John Wayne and Tom Hanks fought for ? Or as Don Hewitt , my hero and the creator of 60 Minutes , replied without shame when someone asked him why he , at age 75 , and Mike Wallace , a certified octogenarian , still labor every day to actually create something : " Mike and I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , we are breeding two entirely different races in America . Coexisting , yes , side by side , pretending to get along . Really , though : different beings , different souls , thinking differently , acting differently , treating women and animals and God differently , inexorably heading in different directions  --  us to the City on the Hill ( or , anyway , to the multiplex theater at the mall ) , they to the gated condo community overlooking the prettiest water hole . // It was time to find out if a Deford Report in 1998 would discover what the Kerner Report did 30 years ago , that America is two societies , only now the division is one golf , one not golf . A poll was commissioned by this magazine , and wise , unbiased men and women contacted people all across the land to discover if things had come to this sad pass . // As you can see , yes , they have . My suspicions were confirmed . We are indeed a dual society now , in that tee-to-green of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of us . The proof follows . Read it and weep . Or : Read it and putt . // Our poll indicates that golfers are a special breed of Americans , distinctive in a number of ways . They are a visceral group that is living large , enjoying the physical pleasures of life and not being terribly concerned about the consequences . Golfers ' main pursuit is their own happiness , and they feel they are achieving it .  --  PETER HARRIS , president Peter Harris Research Group ( and himself a Golfer-American ) // Harris 's polling of more than 1,200 Americans shows that the Golfer-American , defined as someone who plays a minimum of 26 rounds annually , is different from the rest of us in the following ways . // The Golfer-American is far more interested in golf than other Americans are interested in their favorite activities . Golf is a passion ... but : Golfer-Americans drink twice as much liquor as other Americans , they gamble significantly more , and they eat more steak , listen to more rock-and-roll and watch more sports and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ films . Also , the Golfer-American is richer than other Americans ( probably no surprise ) and thinks he 's healthier ( even though he knows he 's not working at it ) . This poses the obvious question : Is it better to booze it up , snarf down T-bones and ride around in a cart and think you 're just fine , or should you do all the really careful things but still worry ? // On the other hand Golfer-Americans are not as artistically creative as other people , are less interested in church and movies , are less intense about volunteer work and eschew spending time helping the needy or , for that matter , participating in self-improvement activities . // Basically , when not obliged to perform everyday vocational and animal functions , Golfer-Americans play golf . Hey , let 's hit another bucket , and then we 'll have a brewski. // Golfer-Americans and other Americans do have a few things in common . These include listening to classical music ( 14% of golfers and 13% of others cite this as " a favorite leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 8% of golfers and 7% of others consider politics " important " ) , liking their jobs ( 40% for golfers , 39% for others ) and being satisfied with their sex lives ( 29% for golfers , 32% for others ) . // But  --  are you ready for this ? I mean really ready ?  --  47% of Golfer-Americans ' spouses ( which is essentially wives , since 98% of the spouses polled turned out to be women ) think their husbands are better lovers because they play golf . Let 's restate that : Virtually half of all golfers ' wives think golf improves their mates ' sexual performance . Why does any linksman even bother to stop at the 19th hole ? ( For purposes of comparison , a mere 15% of wives think that playing golf leaves their husbands " so wasted that they 're useless . " ) // Probably the most fascinating revelation of the poll is that all those stupid golf-widow jokes are wrong . Golfer-Americans feel they have significantly better family relations  --  both with their wives and their children  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than two thirds of Golfer-Americans rate their marriages as either " almost perfect " or " very good . " // Not only that , but the wives themselves endorse their husbands ' golf  --  and not only for its sexual bounty . Ninety-nine percent of golf wives think " it 's great that my husband gets a chance to play a sport . " Have 99% of any sample of wives ever agreed on anything ? And despite all the jokes , only 24% think that golf " takes time away " from activities the couple could do together . The poll shows conclusively that Golfer-Americans are much more inclined to do things with their wives than are other American husbands with their wives . Even when it comes to activities that Golfer-Americans participate in less often than other men-stuff like going to a museum or a concert  --  the golfers are more likely to participate with their wives . By an incredible margin , Golfer-American husbands are more likely than other married men to go on a vacation with their wives . Eighty-five percent of golfers vacation with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . // What are the only three things that non-golfer husbands do more of with their wives ? Work in the yard , go buy groceries and help clean the house . Hey , let 's play another 18 ! // While , with our sitcom mentality , we have always blithely concluded that wives resent their husbands for going off to the course with the guys ( the bad influences ) , evidently another sentiment rules . Golfer-Americans ' wives understand that their husbands love the sport and that it makes them happier ... and better to have around when they get back home . Do n't fight it : It 's bigger than both of us . Meanwhile , the husbands feel so guilty that they 're getting away from yardwork and the Stop &amp; Shop to do something they love that they devote what free time is left to making the little women happy . ( Of course , it probably helps that Golfer-Americans are richer than other citizens and feel so healthy. ) // Golfer-Americans who work for a living have approximately the same amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly large number of the golfers  --  41%  --  take time off from the work-week to get in a game . ( How many doctors were included in the sample was n't revealed . ) Obviously this leaves more time on the weekends for couples to do things together away from the links . As self-indulgent as Golfer-Americans are , they appear to possess more of a wife-and family-centered side than do those husbands who do n't play golf . Marriage counselors , please note . Of course , it 's only fair to report that golf is a source of stress in 20% of marriages . The family that plays together stays together . // Nothing sets Golfer-Americans apart from their alter egos more than the reasons why they love their game . For example , the reason nongolfers most often give for playing another sport is that it 's good exercise . But only 8% of Golfer-Americans are under any illusion that golf is good exercise . This shows , by the way , how much the golf establishment was out of touch with its constituency in the Casey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously fell on the deaf ears of candid Golfer-Americans. // Similarly , golfers , unlike other American athletes , do n't much play their sport for fun . Only 8% of Golfer-Americans think that fun is the most appealing aspect of the game . In other sports more than twice as many participants say they love their game most because it 's enjoyable . So if golf is n't good exercise or much fun , why do golfers play ? // Well , 42% of Golfer-Americans love the game because it 's challenging . For 24% , being outdoors is the prime attraction ( 12% of nongolfers say this about their sports ) , and for 19% it 's being with friends ( a factor mentioned by only 12% who play other sports ) . However , when the question is phrased in another way , the friendship element takes on added importance . When Golfer-Americans were asked , " If you could no longer play golf , what would you miss the most ? " only 13% cited the competition , while 38% said they would miss the camaraderie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the challenge of playing , and they become absorbed with trying to do well at a difficult game . However , it 's the companionship that they would miss the most . " // What 's especially fascinating about this revelation is that a great deal was made of a 1995 article in the Journal of Democracy titled " Bowling Alone : America 's Declining Social Capital , " by Robert Putnam , a Harvard political scientist . Putnam argued that the diminishing popularity of bowling night bespoke an erosion of the nation 's community spirit . But maybe the decline of participation in bowling  --  and in the League of Women Voters , the Elks and the Boy Scouts  --  only speaks to the lack of modern appeal of those activities and organizations . The example of golf suggests that Americans are as much a community as ever . The U.S. is a veritable buddy-dom. // To hell with playing golf . I just want to be a Golfer-American . The sex is great . Your wife wants you to go off with the guys . You can drink all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off from work in the middle of the week , gamble and listen to rock-and-roll , and you do n't even have to pretend to worry about exercising . Amen . // This article contains a table . Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF.
