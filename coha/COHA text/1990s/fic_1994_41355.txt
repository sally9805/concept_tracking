Marian had waited until Sunday morning at breakfast to tell him , putting it off all week . Now that the time had come , she could n't hold back any longer . Sitting at the kitchen table across from him , she gazed out the window in the face of a typical bright spring Seatonville morning . The lawn would soon need its first mowing . <p> She sipped her coffee , unmindful that it had grown cold . Finally plucking up her courage , she parted the silence between them . " Frank  --  . " <p> Intent on taking apart the Sunday paper , he gave no indication that he had heard . " Ca n't find the sports page , " he grumbled to himself in disgust , " for all the damn advertisements . " <p> Over the paper , she could see the upper half of his brown face creased in annoyance , and the crinkly hair graying at the top in a circle like a crown . Taking a deep breath , she said , " Kevin 's coming home today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to move for a long moment . After a while , the words came out almost inaudibly , <p> " He 's ... better ? " <p> " No . " She set down her cup . " Worse . " <p> His fingers loosened around the paper . Parts of it fell to the floor . " Why wait until now to tell me ? His father . " <p> She shrugged , trying to make it seem like no big thing . " I did n't want to worry you , " she lied . Actually , it was the fear of telling him . How he might react . What effect it would have on him . <p> " Worry me ? Considering all we 've been through with the other one ? " Sadly he shook his head . Leaving the half-eaten food on his plate , he got up from the table . " I 'm going to get ready for church . " <p> She began to clear off the dishes , scraping the leftover sausage and pancakes into the garbage disposal . Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the week , it was usually get as one could . She took a hurried cup of coffee before leaving for work at the social services office ; Kevin and Cal gulped down cereal and milk before school and Frank , fortified with juice , would leave to give his football team an early workout prior to classes . <p> She placed the dishes in the almond dishwasher that matched the refrigerator and stove . She would turn it on later . Then , picking up the paper from the floor , she neatly folded it back in order and carried it into the paneled family room extending from the kitchen . There , she put it on the coffee table . The large photograph of the boys on the mantle of the fireplace drew her attention . They were in college at Morehouse when it was taken  --  Cal , a junior , and Kevin , a freshman . Kevin looked pensive as usual in his shirt and tie . He had her reddish skin with deep-set brown eyes . Kevin always carried the weight of the world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own . <p> Cal smiling in his sweater with the big M on it , was the image of his father with a broad , round open face . He had just started growing a moustache . Easygoing Cal was the one who had fulfilled his father 's dream of becoming a professional basketball player . In his father 's time , there had n't been too many opportunities , no matter how good you were . Cal , the winner  --  until he finally lost . Tears watered her eyes . You give birth to them , you rear them , but you never dream they might go before you do . Is n't youth supposed to be synonymous with longevity ? <p> " Marian , are n't you going to get ready ? " Frank was back in the kitchen knotting his tie , the hideous purple-and-yellow one he knew she disliked that clashed outrageously with his brown suit . Was choosing it an unconscious sign of pending confrontation ? <p> " I 'm not going to church , Frank . I have to meet Kevin in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kevin . " He started to the back door and stopped , holding tightly to the knob . " I do n't know if I can go through all that again . " <p> " I know , " she said quietly . <p> " No , you do n't know ! " His voice raised in bitterness . " You just do n't . " <p> The kitchen door slammed as he went out to the garage . The wheels of his Toyota spun noisily in the driveway . <p> Staring into space , she wanted to scream that she did ! She knew what effect Cal had had on him  --  her . Constant changes that emitted sporadic miniature earthquakes in their lives . She shivered as memories created chills within her . She , too , was only just so strong . <p> She plugged in the coffee pot . Something to warm the cold in her body . " Please , Jesus , do n't let it be as bad for him as it was for Cal , " she prayed aloud . <p> The plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to call it when they came home from Atlanta or the holidays . She stood waiting in the small terminal hands shoved deeply into the pockets of her plaid woolen coat sweater hanging below her hips over the gray slacks . From the window , she could see the small plane landing . He was the last to get off , holding carefully to the rails as he descended the steps . <p> " Oh ! " The gasp slipped out . <p> A woman wearing a floppy hat nearby looked at her quickly . " Are you all right ? " <p> " Yeah . " She tried to smile . She was all right , but Kevin . Her heart sank as she watched him walking in a slow shuffle toward the door of the terminal with a book in his hand . Kevin held books ; Cal , basketballs . His clothes were too large for him , khaki-colored pants bagging around his legs . The jacket with UCLA hung loosely around his frame , engulfing him . He looked like a scarecrow someone had facetiously draped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came closer , it was his face that made her heart cry out . His motorcycle glasses eclipsed a gaunt face of an old man . He was just twenty-eight . Immediately , she realized that , unlike Cal he had waited longer before coming home . <p> Spotting her , he smiled and waved , " Hi , mom ! " <p> For a moment , she could say nothing , only fold his frail body tightly in her arms . <p> " You 're as good-looking as ever he winked . <p> " Stop trying to flatter me , " she laughed , thinking that only this morning she had noticed the new pinches between her eyes , lines around her mouth , and fast-fading dark hair . " Where 's dad ? " he asked , looking around . <p> She made a show of checking her watch . " By now , he should be home from church waiting for us while parked on the sofa in front of the television watching a game , " she smiled . " Let 's get your bags . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She was n't walking fast , but she had to slow down for him , adjust her gait to his laborious movements . " I 'm so glad you 're here , " she said , squeezing his hand , " where you should be . " She knew it had been a hard decision for him , the independent one in the family , to make . <p> When they reached the house , she saw that the Toyota was n't there . Inside , the house was empty , but the television was on in the family room and an empty beer can sat on the coffee table . <p> " Your father probably went to get some beer . I forgot to yesterday when I went shopping . " <p> " Yeah . " He coughed a dry sound , averting his eyes . <p> Upstairs , she went into an elaborate pretense of straightening up the room that had been meticulously prepared for his coming two days ago . Everything was in place , spotlessly clean . <p> " Would you like to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too many questions at once , she thought , exposing her anxiety . " I made that apple pie you like . " <p> " Great ! " He eased down on the bed , the same mahogany one matching his dresser and night table . The room continued to house his history with the Morehouse and UCLA pennants , high school diploma , photographs and books . He had lived away for seven years . California was like another planet compared to this small Georgia town . He had just one more year to complete his dissertation  --  ABD , as they called it  --  while teaching in a community college outside L.A. Years of study 's labor lost . Feeling physical and mental pain , he grimaced . <p> She saw him flinch . It was as if the pain had gone though her , too . When he pulled off his jacket , she could see the purple-brown spots on the back of his neck . It was a film replayed , flashbacks of Cal , but with another son now the main character in a similar drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , busying herself with stacking pillows for his comfort . " You have an appointment tomorrow . " <p> " He was Cal 's doctor , was n't he ? " <p> " He 's the best in town , " she smiled reassuringly . Best to her because he was the most understanding , compassionate , concerned . He did not give a prognosis of death before its time . His tonic was hope . He was young , white , and , she knew , gay . <p> Suddenly he burst into tears , sobbing , the weight of it all consuming him , made harder by the sight of her , the familiarity of the room , his guilt . " Mom , I do n't want to die ! " <p> She put her arms around him , consoling , steadying , attempting to impart what strength she had . " Sh-hh . Let 's not talk about dying . It 's living that concerns us now . " <p> " Excuse me . " He got up , pushing back the glasses that had slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom . I go more now , you know . " <p> How well she knew . The accompanying diarrhea . She would have to store up on adult diapers and bedliners . She felt as if she could still smell the sickness in Cal 's room down the hall . See the ghost of him lying there in bed . They now used it for storage because neither wanted to go into it anymore , remembering the horrifying debilitating sickness that had wasted him . Spare this son , for after him , there would be none . <p> She was in the kitchen basting the roast when Frank returned . He had changed into his old warm-up suit with Seatonville High Raiders on the back . Without looking at her , he sat the grocery bag on the counter . " Where is he ? " <p> " Upstairs resting . Dinner will be ready soon . " <p> Opening the refrigerator , he put a six-pack of Bud Lite and half gallon of ice cream in it . Suddenly he blurted out , " Damn , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the apple of his eye . Cal whom they had finally gotten used to not being with them anymore . " No , " she said . " It wo n't be exactly like Cal . Now we know what to expect . How better to cope with it  --  and each other . " <p> She went over to embrace him , putting her arms around a once trim athletic waistline thickening with age and less care . " Frank , it wo n't be as bad as before . We 've learned from our mistakes . " <p> She tried to blot out the memory of his leaving them . That summer he went away right at the end of the school year in June . Disappeared without a word to escape the sight of his once strong son slowly dying from a disease that had yet no cure , no road to recovery , no odds . She had taken a leave of absence from her job as a social worker to attend to Cal , living off savings and money from rental property her mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his fluctuating anger , despondency , anguish , self-deprecating humor , and her own sorrowful grief . <p> When he did come back , all he said was , " Marian , I 'm sorry . " <p> She felt him move out of her arms to go to the refrigerator . " Why us ? " he asked , as if to himself , opening a beer . " Two of them . We brought them up right , did n't we ? Knowing right from wrong . " <p> " We ca n't follow them through life forever , Frank . There comes a time when they have to make their own choices . Decisions . Follow their own ... heartbeat . " <p> Suddenly he wheeled around to face her in anger . " We 've never had any like that on my side of the family , " he flung accusingly at her . " Have you ? " <p> " Frank , how can any of us be certain who or what is in a family ? " she snapped back , getting a paring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had surmised about Kevin when he come to Cal 's funeral and brought Dave  --  handsome , blonde Dave , who sat closely beside him at the services . She was becoming more aware now , knowledgeable , having gone to the library to educate herself . She had learned a lot , too , in Atlanta where Dr. Lewis had advised her to take Cal in the final stage , for there were better facilities and support services . <p> Staying with him in the hospital room with her gown , mask , and gloves on , watching over her son and listening while he talked with others like himself , she had grown more perceptive . She was n't surprised about Kevin . When Frank had found out about Cal , it almost killed him . He did n't want to accept it . " Athletes are men , " he raged , " not fucking faggots ! " He would have rather it had been from needles . <p> Cal 's obituary read that he died from pneumonia , but everyone had guessed . The sickness itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in small towns where streets , houses , and people are closely interlocked . They had to endure the whispers , the side-glances ; forgive the ignorant friends who came to visit less and less because they we afraid of " catching it , " causing their group of friends to diminish into a thin line . Let trouble come , and you 'll know who your friends are . Their longtime pastor told them that Cal had died because he had sinned against God 's directives . After that , they changed churches . <p> She put the potatoes on to boil . The sun was inching back into its bed in the sky , making the day grow dimmer . Upstairs , she could hear the toilet flushing again . <p> " Life 's not fair to some , " she sighed , going into the family room to sit on the couch . " We have this to contend with in our mid-years when people are planning to retire , travel spend time with ... grandchildren . " <p> He joined her on the couch , setting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he repeated slowly . " We 'll never have any . No lineage . " <p> " We would n't have anyway . Even if ... , " she stopped . " But we would have had them . " She wanted to cry . <p> They withdrew into silence as if for shelter from their words , thoughts , dashed dreams . Finally she said , " Frank , we still have one son left , upstairs , who needs us . He came home to us . " Her voice softened . " Why do n't you go up to see him ? Talk to him . " <p> " What about ? Having sex with men . " <p> " Frank ! That was unkind . He 's sick ! " <p> " Sick unto death , " he muttered . " I hope it was n't that damn white boy who gave it to him , that swish who came to Cal 's funeral . White people have done enough to us already . Now they want to inject their sex poisoning into our race . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... seems like some people have to have them , " she said , shaking her head sadly . " Frank , there are black gays , too . Only the black community does n't want to face up to it . They want to close their eyes and minds while our young men are dying . It 's not sex or race . It 's the sickness we need to deal with . Taking them away from us . " She reached out to touch his face , feeling the tightness of his skin . " Let 's try to remember how our sons lived , achieved . Made us proud ! Go up to him , Frank , please . We 're family . " <p> He stared down at the floor in thought , then back up at the television and the game he had n't been watching . " I 'll go up , " he said wearily . " Take him a beer . " <p> " Take him love , too . " <p> Kevin was lying on his back in the bed , arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearing his father enter , he turned and smiled . " Hello , dad . " <p> " Hi , son . " He patted his shoulder . He had never been very demonstrative with his sons  --  a handshake , backslap , an infrequent hug . A man 's way . He stood awkwardly beside the bed . Looking down upon the shrunken figure , he thought , This is n't my son ; it 's his ghost lying there . He felt drained , old , and tired . <p> " Brought you a beer . " He handed the can to him . One beer could n't do anymore harm . A beer between men . <p> " Thanks , dad . " Kevin pushed himself up , taking the drink . Beer was never his favorite . " You breaking training with this stuff ? " he teased , flipping open the can . <p> " Nope . I do n't coach anymore . Just teach . Got too old to handle it , " he half-smiled . The truth was that there had been too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the foot of the bed . <p> They sipped the beer while silently scrutinizing each other . " I guess it 's tough , two of us in the family , " Kevin said softly , almost apologetically . " It was n't planned , " he laughed , trying to turn it into a joke . The laughter choked into a cough . " Sorry , bad pun , huh ? " Seeing the pain in his father 's face , he added , " I 'm going to lick this , dad . " <p> " Sure , sure you are . That 's the Bryant spirit . Fight ! Make that basket . Be a winner ! " So far , no one had been a winner yet in this game . <p> " I 'm going to finish my dissertation while I 'm here with all this time to recuperate . Brought all my stuff . " He waved his hand at some of the books he had already taken out and put on the nightstand beside his glasses . <p> " What 's it about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black writers of the sixties . " <p> " Sounds like a winner . " He put his half-empty beer can on the night table . Finally , because he had to know , " You ever do drugs ? " <p> " A weed , now and then . Nothing heavy . " He looked at him . " Cal would n't even do that . He was a great athlete . " <p> " Yeah . " The trophies stacked in the trunk in his silent room attested to that . Out of sight , out of mind . He would get them out tomorrow . Put them back in the family room where they belonged . Trophies to his memory . <p> Kevin politely tried to make a show of drinking the beer . He did n't like the taste . It had grown warm . " You know , dad , " he began , thinking it had to come out , to be faced , " people have different ... feelings . Cal and me , we just .... " <p> " Sure , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked down at the floor , then back up at Kevin , seeing Cal too . It 's the sickness , she had said . That was what mattered , not the other . " Kevin , you 're my son , " he said gently . " I love you . " He was astonished at how easily the words came out on their own . Like they were just waiting there . He wished that he had told Cal that before the end , but the bitterness would n't let him . <p> " Dinner 's ready ! " They heard her calling up the steps . <p> " We 'd better go down . Your mother has summoned , " he laughed , getting up . <p> He took the beer that his son had bravely tried to drink in companionship . " Hey , do n't bother with this stuff . I got that cherry vanilla ice cream you like to go with your mother 's pie ! " <p> " Great ! " <p> Seeing him waver as he tried to stand , he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " A little tired from the flight , I guess , " he grinned sheepishly . <p> Frank put his arms around his shoulders to support him , feeling the tissue paper thinness of his shoulders . I can handle this again , he promised himself , I have to . My last boy . Suddenly warmth spread through him like courage . Impulsively he hugged him tightly . " We 're on our way , " he called down . " Father and son ! " <p> Ann Alley Shockley is a librarian at Fisk University in Nashville , Tennessee .
