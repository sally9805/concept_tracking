<p> Nothing ignites the tinderbox of public debate in America these days like the " V-word . " <p> Values . American values . Family values . <p> Whether traditional or modern , steeped in old-time religion or rooted in new age philosophy , values have moved out of the home and set up residence at the top of the agenda when it comes to what 's wrong - or right - about America . <p> But what exactly are American values ? The debate ranges from issues of virtue and personal character to concerns about the very structure and definition of family . <p> Concepts of faith , trust , respect and community . Can any institution as constantly changing as the American family even try to establish a fixed set of values that would win broad endorsement by millions of Americans ? <p> Who bears the responsibility for teaching these values ? Few families have ever sat down to write a " top 10 " values list or even taken the process one step further to determine how , if ever , they try to reinforce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll hear a common theme : Where American values go , so goes the nation . A generally agreed-upon set of primary values is important to the social and cultural health of America . Apart from that common ground , however , the values debate splinters on highly personal lines . <p> " Everywhere you look , Americans are longing for family values , " said John Eldredge , director of public policy for Focus on the Family . The Colorado Springs-based organization is one of many voices crying for a return to a more traditional set of family values , including shifting the social trend lines away from single-parent families and back toward two-parent households . <p> " There 's no question that there is a core set of values Americans share , values like commitment , justice , honesty , compassion , " Eldredge said . " But what has hurt the vitality of those values is the small but rather vocal minority saying that there is no universal value except tolerance . That plays well in the public square , but it just does n't reflect broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shake free of its nostalgia trap regarding the family and adopt a new outlook on values that better fits today 's family reality . <p> " We have totally created a fantasy view of the family , and historically it 's just not true , " said Barbara O'Brien , executive director of the Colorado Children 's Campaign . " The context in which the family operates has changed . It used to be that hard work and good work habits could take you a long way . You could work on an assembly line and make a good income . There was more slack in the system for people who made mistakes and got back on their feet again . " <p> Stephanie Coontz , an author and professor at Evergreen State College in Olympia , Wash. , believes the debate over values ca n't be limited to the home . It must expand into the public arena , to schools , churches , public and private agencies where families are increasingly turning for help in nurturing the next generation of Americans . <p> " The question that gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and family values is whether we as a society have the ' character ' to make hard decisions about priorities and the ' strong values ' to defer immediate gratification in order to pursue long-range aspirations , " Coontz says . <p> The issue of values has simmered on the national agenda since long before former Vice President Dan Quayle chastised prime-time TV show character Murphy Brown for advocating bearing children out of wedlock . <p> Consider former Secretary of Education William Bennett 's 1993 best seller " The Book of Virtues " and the phenomenal growth of Christian family groups like Colorado 's Focus on the Family and Promise Keepers . <p> In the corporate world , ' 90s-minded businesses have adopted sets of " shared values " to unify employees under common goals . Marketing campaigns have even raised the family banner and beaten it mercilessly . Swedish car-maker Volvo cleverly tagged its American advertising campaign with the slogan : " Your precious cargo . " Tire companies use cherubic infants as " spokesmen , " and even Gillette has embraced fatherhood to sell its line of Sensor shaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family values are getting a very public airing . A recent spate of television ads by the Colorado Democratic Party is priming the pump for another round of sparring between Democrats and Republicans in next year 's national election . Some have even pointed to the results of the 1994 national elections as an indication that America is undergoing a " self-correction " and retreating from more liberal interpretations of family structure and family life . <p> " There is a pretty firm consensus on what every single young child needs , " O'Brien said . " We have plenty of information on what kids need . We just have not created the public will to ensure that every kid gets what they need to become productive adults . " <p> For those like Focus on the Family 's Eldredge , the answer lies in harkening back to those " halcyon days " when families were nuclear and mommies were home . <p> " It 's difficult to sustain the values that make for healthy families alone , " Focus on the Family 's Eldredge said . <p> " Families are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see people wanting to make these commitments and yet still failing , " Eldredge said . " But still you see just two of five ( children ) growing up in single-parent homes . Three are still in traditional two-parent homes , doing the best they can . How have they done that , against government indifference if not hostility , strong opposition of popular culture ? In spite of political pressure and cultural trends , in spite of all these obstacles , people are forming families . " <p> More than a few researchers and activist groups have lamented the fall of values . According to the 1989 Massachusetts Mutual survey , only 6 percent of families responding rated American family life in general " excellent , " compared to 54 percent who rated it " only fair " or " poor . " Sixty-two percent said American family values had deteriorated , with only 14 percent saying those values had strengthened . <p> But how regularly are values practiced ? Over and over again , experts emphasize that values are caught , not taught . Yet family life indicates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not that religious about practicing them . <p> " Values are talked about more than they 're practiced , that fact is clear , " said Willie Wooten , director of the counseling department at Focus on the Family . " It 's not that parents today lack information ; it 's that they do n't put it into practice . " <p> That may be because it 's a harsher environment for families today . In the past , values were planted and nurtured in the home , fortified in the schools and strengthened in practice in society . Today , that chain is broken . Parents hoping to instill values in the home say lessons are diluted by the cacophony of messages from television , movies , video technology and society as a whole . <p> Joanne Blum , executive director of Families First , says her nonprofit child abuse prevention agency sees the price paid by families that feel more isolated than ever . <p> " Fifty years ago we relied on extended families for help and support : aunts , uncles , cousins , grandparents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two kids , dad and mom at home , " Blum said . " As families have moved away from the old nucleus , the old neighborhood , they have to re-create that support system on their own . That 's even harder for a single parent family . " <p> From birth , children are socialized with the distinct values of their own family unit , their community , their ethnic background and their nationality . While similarities exist in these areas , it makes for a distinctly American " value soup . " <p> In May , Parents magazine asked 7,700 readers to respond to a survey on " What are Your Family Values ? " The results resoundingly supported the idea that preparing a child for a successful life means raising that child with a firm set of values . <p> Sixty one percent of respondents said they want their children to have values identical with or very similar to their own . That same group also said they 'd be more likely to be disturbed if their children made different lifestyle choices as adults , including living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a child outside of marriage . <p> The top 10 values most important to teach children ( in order of importance as listed by Parents readers ) : Basic ideas of right and wrong ; the importance of education ; standards concerning sexual behavior ; tolerance for people of different races , ages , values , etc. ; the importance of marriage and family ; the value of friendship ; good manners and appropriate social behavior ; the importance of each individual 's achieving his or her full potential ; religious beliefs ; the importance and necessity of hard work and delaying gratification . <p> Values scoring the lowest on the survey : ecology and preserving our planet ; patriotism ; and an appreciation of art and culture . <p> To many people , these values are the groundwork for the free society America has today . In fact , it 's argued by some , that the above list has remained fairly solid despite massive changes in American family life . <p> " We can no more change the truth of family values than we can change the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 150-family Mount Gilead Baptist Church in Denver . <p> " It 's been a moral precedent of truth for years and you do n't just wake up one day and decide to change it , not unless you want to destroy and disrupt everything in our society . <p> " The day we want to change the law of gravity is the day we 'll have to destroy and
