<p> It 's drizzling in Clarkston , Ga. , 20 minutes outside Atlanta , and I 'm at a book tour stop about to read an excerpt from my first novel . <p> " Before we begin , " comes the West Indian accent of the dashiki-wearing bookseller , as he lifts a bowl of water , " let us pause to offer a libation to the ancestors . We 'll have a moment of silence . " <p> It 's an African tradition . I 'm awed as he pours a silent trickle of water onto the carpet while the room sits in a respectful hush . <p> The significance of this moment at African Spectrum bookstore - something my publicist at HarperCollins could n't have known to brief me on - stands out as an initiation to the world of black books , a world unto itself , settling into its niche . <p> From Miami to Oakland , Calif. , I gained a privileged perspective on how that close-knit world is flourishing . At Black Images Books in Dallas , I was n't entranced merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also by the diverse book categories - from mysteries to romances to teen novels - displayed like aisles at a Blockbuster Video store . <p> My novel , " The Between , " is about a black family 's ordeal with a stalker and the supernatural . At the Dallas store , bookseller Emma Rodgers apologized to me for putting " The Between " into her Mystery section because she does n't have a category for Horror/Suspense . Scanning the rows of books in her store , and the endless categories represented there , I had to smile . <p> Not long ago , her store would n't have had a mystery section , either . Or a self-help section . Or a teen section . <p> The bashful courtship between mainstream publishing and black writers that began a few years ago , on the skirts of Terry McMillan and " Waiting to Exhale , " is now a firm , deepening union . And black readers are the glue . <p> Blacks are buying books , you see . Lots of books . <p> Last year , blacks spent more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News , a Chicago-based marketing research firm specializing in the African-American market . Book sales to blacks rose 48 percent between 1990 and 1993 , a period in which sales to white readers decreased by 10 percent . <p> Target estimates blacks will spend $ 330 million on books this year , 11 percent higher than the $ 297 million in 1994 . <p> " Books are the great boom in the ' 90s among black consumers , " says Target president Ken Smikle . " Most of this is a result of a large black middle-class that places a lot of value in reading , either for information or for leisure . And it took the phenomenon of Terry McMillan 's book for the industry to recognize the potential that was always there . " <p> Clara Villarosa , owner of Denver 's Hue-Man Experience Book Store at 911 Park Ave . West , puts it this way : " What Terry McMillan did was capture the voice of the African-American urban female . Once their voice was heard , they began to read more and this stimulated other African-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> The corollary - part chicken , part egg - is the number , and variety , of black books on the market . Approximately 80 black-themed titles are published a year . Random House/Ballantine unveiled its multicultural One World line in 1991 , introducing novels by Bebe Moore Campbell ( " Your Blues Ai n't Like Mine " ) and Barbados native Cecil Foster ( " Sleep on , Beloved " ) . <p> And established writers are being uplifted alongside the newer ones . In 1993 , the Book-of-the-Month Club 's Quality Paperback Bookclubs began offering the Griot Edition , classic books by black writers like Toni Morrison , James Baldwin , John Williams , Gloria Naylor and Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe . <p> Of course , it 's not the first time black writers have captured the publishing world 's imagination . Richard Wright 's " Native Son " was a best seller in 1940 , and Ann Petry sold more than a million copies of " The Street " in 1946 . Not to mention the phenomenal success of Alex Haley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate is certainly reminiscent of the Harlem Renaissance , which peaked in the ' 20s , and the politically charged black arts movement of the late ' 60s and ' 70s . <p> But this is the ' 90s , the age of superstores , when everything is in grand proportion . <p> " It 's not a new thing , but it 's certainly a much bigger thing , " says Blanche Richardson , manager of Marcus Book Stores in San Francisco , at 35 years old the country 's longest-running black bookstore . " Everybody is looking for their own Terry McMillan . They 're all looking for a pot of gold . " <p> Muses best-selling author Walter Mosley , who built his reputation on his Easy Rawlins mystery series , which began appearing in 1990 : " The whole nature of something being like a wave is that it goes up and it goes down . <p> " But maybe this is n't true for black publishing , because this is the first time we 've had all these black bookstores . And maybe it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentsia , people who consider themselves the vanguard of black thinking , it 's people who like to ' read books . " ' <p> With all of black readers ' various appetites , is there a blueprint for a " black book " ? Writers say absolutely not . <p> ' Out there alone ' <p> The works of longtime author Ernest J. Gaines , which include " The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman " ( 1971 ) and " A Gathering of Old Men " ( 1983 ) , are taught in universities . But Gaines , who rose to prominence in the ' 60s , says there should be no singular model for black fiction . ( His last novel , " A Lesson Before Dying , " was published in 1993 . ) <p> " It 's up to that individual writer himself to go into the direction he wishes . He is out there alone , " says Gaines , who lives part time in Miami . <p> Adds Mosley : " Now , a lot of black people are reading simply to celebrate seeing black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but social , the kind of language we speak , the kind of history we have . " <p> " We 're pioneering , " adds Eboni Snoe , who writes romances for Kensington Publishing 's ethnic Arabesque line . " All of a sudden , all you 've been served is meat and potatoes , and people are saying , ' Here 's some asparagus , here 's some broccoli . " ' <p> Snoe ( a pseudonym ) says she never set out to make a statement by writing romances about black characters ; she only knew what she wanted to read . Lucky for her , she appeared at a time when publishing was paying attention . Her first novel , " A Sheik 's Spell , " was published by Odyssey in 1992 . Her latest , " The Passion Ruby , " appears in November . <p> ' It 's a fun time ' <p> " I spread that word to anybody who comes to me . I say the timing could n't be better . Do whatever you 're doing . Finish it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a fun time , " says Houston-based novelist Anita Richmond Bunkley , who remembers when times were less friendly . <p> In the 1980s , she wrote " The Yellow Rose , " based loosely on the real-life mulatto woman who was the topic of the song " The Yellow Rose of Texas " in the 1800s . An agent loved it but told Bunkley it was n't marketable - so Bunkley published it herself and peddled it at beauty parlors , churches and elsewhere . <p> " It was tough . I was ahead of my time when I did that , but it was the only story I wanted to write , " says Bunkley , whose latest novel , " Wild Embers , " was published by Penguin/Dutton in February . <p> The day is brighter , also , for Octavia E. Butler , a science fiction writer recently awarded a MacArthur grant . Nine of her 10 novels are currently in print ; she is probably best-known for " Kindred " ( 1979 ) and " Parable of the Sower " ( 1993 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to figure out , despite my picture being all over the place , that I might be black . No one expected a science fiction writer to be black , " says Butler , who lives near Los Angeles . <p> " People ask me why there are n't more black science fiction writers , and I say it 's because there are n't more black science fiction writers . People do what they see other people doing . " <p> It 's black mystery writers who have arrived like a gunshot . <p> " Mysteries tend to cross lines , " says Valerie Wilson Wesley , whose newest Tamara Hayle mystery , " Devil 's Gon na Get Him , " appeared in July . <p> She says she was fortunate that her first novel , " When Death Comes Stealing , " appeared at a time when both McMillan and Mosley were on the best-seller list . With her female private eye , she says , " my book would kind of bridge those markets . " <p> Eleanor Taylor Bland , who just published " Done Wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an outreach to women of color within Sisters in Crime , an international group for female mystery writers . <p> " We have a responsibility to be that missing piece , " says Bland , who lives near Chicago . " I feel responsible , if I 'm going to write a book , to as accurately as possible and truthfully as possible depict my own people - because we were excluded for so long . " <p> But , unlike Richard Wright and others before her , Bland says she can not write out of rage or indignation . That is not her experience , says Bland , a grandmother . <p> Telling a story <p> " I 'm just sitting here telling a story , and telling a story is a very long tradition among our people , " she says . " The good writers write what we like , and we 're just as quality as the ' literary ' stuff . We 're not turning out trash . " <p> One of the most recognizable characters in black mysteries is Mosley 's Easy Rawlins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dress " ( the movie version , starring Denzel Washington , opens in September ) . Mosley followed with " A Red Death " ( 1991 ) , " White Butterfly " ( 1992 ) , and " Black Betty " ( 1994 ) , all whodunits set where Mosley grew up , in South Central L.A. <p> Mosley 's newest novel , " R.L. 's Dream , " is not a mystery . To him , defying categories is part of the point of the new age of black writers . <p> " What we 're doing is starting a dialogue , " says Mosley , who chairs PEN , an international association of poets , playwrights , editors , essayists and novelists . PEN 's Open Book Committee has a mission to open the business side of the publishing industry to people of color . " I 'm doing that politically with the publishing world - and certainly we can do it with movies , we can do it with talks , we help businesses like the black bookstores , and all of that is part of the resurgence @ @
