<p> In a chilly , windowless room in a New York suburb , four men are tapping furiously at their laptop computers . Their mission : crack into the computer system of a major American corporation . <p> Things seem to be going well , for them . " All right , we 're through the firewall , " announced one bearded hacker . A few moments later , a second practitioner of high-tech mischief pronounced himself pleased by what he saw inside  --  a digital picture of vulnerability rendered by the lines of computer code dancing across his screen . " Looks like we can toast it , " he said . <p> Charles Palmer , a slender , bearded 40-year-old computer scientist , looked on with pride at the members of his team . Skilled hackers , Mr. Palmer noted , are scarce these days , at least ones that he will hire . <p> " It 's hard to find good people in this field who do not have criminal records , " he explained . <p> Mr. Palmer and his team work for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hacking is legal . Companies pay the I.B.M . squad to attack their computer systems to test how well they can stand up to the increasing assaults by real hackers . The growing ranks of cyberintruders are engaged in everything from snooping around to " parking " pornography and pirated software on unsuspecting corporate machines to computer-assisted fraud and theft . <p> White-hat hackers , like those at I.B.M. , are only one kind of computer-security professional whose skills are much in demand today . Once an arcane specialty , computer security has moved into the mainstream . As companies rush onto the Internet , they benefit from improved communication with customers , suppliers and far-flung employees , but they also take on far greater risk that their corporate computer systems will be breached by outsiders with malicious intent . <p> The dangers of a networked world have created boom times for computer security consultants , auditors , cryptographers and others . Lately , they must contend with pushy headhunters as well as hackers . Five years ago , six-figure salaries were rare in the security field . Today , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $200,000 a year or more . <p> Recognizing a sellers ' market for computer-security expertise , Wietse Venema has come to America , and he 's selling . A computer scientist from the University of Eindhoven in the Netherlands , Mr. Venema is the co-author of Satan , a sophisticated software program intended to find security flaws in any computer system linked to the Internet . The 45-year-old Dutch researcher is considering offers from I.B.M . and other leading American computer companies . " Many people are interested in my capabilties now , " he observed cheerfully . <p> Experts , like Mr. Venema , are suddenly stars because corporations are spending more on computer security . This year , companies worldwide are expected to spend $6.3 billion on security for their computer networks , estimates Dataquest , a market research firm . Within three years , the security price tag is projected to more than double to nearly $12.9 billion  --  a figure that is only for services supplied by outside contractors , so it excludes spending on in-house staff , security software or hardware products . <p> The industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comprises hundreds of companies . They run the gamut from large companies with worldwide computer consulting practices , like I.B.M. , the Science Applications International Corporation and Perot Systems , and Big Six accounting firms , like Coopers &; Lybrand , Ernst &; Young and Deloitte &; Touche , down to one-man independent consultants , like Mr. Seiden . <p> Fueling the surge in computer-security spending is fear . The corporate concerns are heightened with every report of hackers defacing well-known World Wide Web sites , like the recent attacks on the sites of the Central Intelligence Agency and the Justice Department . The Federal Bureau of Investigation says few intrusions into corporate computer systems  --  15 percent at most  --  are ever reported to law enforcement agencies . But the handful that are reported , like the 1994 case of Russian hackers who tapped into Citibank and made $10 million in illegal funds transfers ( all but $400,000 was recovered ) , tend to cause alarm . <p> " The business is not so much network security as it is network insecurity , " noted Alice Murphy , an analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there now . " <p> Just how great the threat is to corporate computer systems is a matter of debate . The Internet , observes Peter Neumann , a computer scientist at SRI International , a research group in Menlo Park , Calif. , was never really designed to be secure . Once the bailiwick of a small community of researchers , it is starting to be used as a freeway of commerce . " The infrastructure is vulnerable , " Mr. Neumann said . " From that larger perspective , the risks are enormous . " <p> Dan Farmer , the co-author of Satan with the Dutch researcher Mr. Venema , did a survey of 1,700 corporate and government Web sites late last year and found that more than 60 percent of them had " serious potential security vulnerabilities . " Mr. Farmer , a programmer at Sun Microsystems Inc. , did not break into the computer systems , but he said they were open to attack and often could be severely damaged . ( His survey results are posted on the Web , at www.trouble.org . ) <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between potential vulnerability and the actual business risk to corporate computer systems . " There is risk , but the threat tends to be vastly overstated , " said George Colony , president of Forrester Research Inc. , a consulting firm in Cambridge , Mass . <p> Forrester estimates that losses from fraud in Internet commerce are likely to be roughly $1 for every $1,000 of business . To put the matter into perspective , the fraud losses in cellular phone service are $20 for every $1,000 , according to Forrester , while the losses on credit card transactions are nearly $2 for every $1,000 of goods charged . <p> Still , even skeptics , like Forrester 's Mr. Colony , agree that computer security requires continuous attention . " It is a manageable risk , and it should not deter companies from jumping into Internet commerce , " Mr. Colony said . " But I also tell our clients that they should think of computer security as a guerrilla war that will last forever . " <p> The F.B.I . is treating the battle against computer crime as a long-running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations as part of the curriculum at the F.B.I . Academy in Quantico , Va . And last year , the bureau established three computer crime squads in San Francisco , New York and Washington , to pursue cybercrime more aggressively . <p> " We 're really on the cusp of this becoming a major problem , " said James Kallstrom , head of the F.B.I . office in New York . " As more and more of the economy goes digital , there are huge incentives for criminal attacks on American corporations . " <p> Computer crime , of course , comes in many forms . An employee with a grudge and access to a company 's computer network may well be far more dangerous , and costly , than even the most artful hacker . <p> A survey released two weeks ago by the Computer Security Institute , and conducted on behalf of the F.B.I . ' s computer crime unit , estimated computer security losses last year at $100 million  --  a total only among some 250 companies and organizations that would place dollar figures on their losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The criminal hackers have long been engaged in a kind of cat-and-mouse game with law enforcement agencies and private computer security experts . And that game is increasingly being played at a higher level , with greater skill and new tools . <p> The cell-phone hackers of the past , who electronically jimmied phones for the thrill and free phone service , have graduated to Web site hacking . Today , there are an estimated 440 hacker bulletin boards , 1,900 Web sites purveying hacking tips and tools , and 30 hackers publications like " Phrack " and " 2600 : The Hacker Quarterly . " There are readily available software programs for hacking tactics like " war dialing , " " sniffing " and " fingering "  --  all used to exploit security weaknesses in computer systems . <p> " As the stakes become higher , the technical sophistication of the people doing this kind of illegal activity is increasing , " said Edward Hart , a senior vice president of Science Applications International . <p> Today , there is a brisk , illicit market in hacking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking into a corporate Web site typically in the $8,000-to-$10,000 range . Bonus payments are usually demanded for trade secrets pilfered or damage inflicted on a competitor 's computer system . <p> Limiting the risk , and damage , to corporate computer systems is the goal of Mr. Palmer and the other security specialists at I.B.M . The test hacking done by his team is mainly a fact-finding tool , and only one of many . The authorized break-ins by these groups , called " tiger teams , " is often more valuable as a marketing tactic than as a research tool . Thick and exhaustive studies of a company 's computer security can be met with yawning indifference by top executives , but a break-in gets their attention . <p> Mundane rules , not high-tech wizardry , are crucial to reducing security risks . A robust firewall to filter what electronic traffic gets into a company 's computer system is helpful , but it can be a Maginot Line approach to security  --  the real weaknesses are elsewhere . <p> To work from home , employees may have dial-up modems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Employees , security experts warn , must be told to give their passwords to no one ; one scam is for hackers to call new employees , pretending to be members of the corporate technology staff doing a check of passwords . Another frequent weakness is simple physical security , watching who goes in or out of the building . <p> These are hectic times for security consultants like I.B.M . ' s Nick Simicich , a 44-year-old self-taught programmer . He works from his home in Boca Raton , Fla. , equipped with powerful computers running Linux , a shareware program that is the operating system of choice for hackers . <p> Mostly , though , Mr. Simicich is on the road , 85 percent of the time , he estimates , logging perhaps 150,000 air miles a year . Continental , the airline he flies most regularly , invited Mr. Simicich to a company parade last year . <p> He proudly calls himself a " paid professional paranoid . " His goal , he says , is not to make corporate computer systems immune to hackers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real goal is to raise the bar . First , we do want to make it harder for them to break in , so the average hacker moves to an easier target . Second , when they do get in , we want to insure that the damage is limited .
