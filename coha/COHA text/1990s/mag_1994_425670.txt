Section : SOCIETY Justice : In this fearful election season , politicians have found an irresistible target : prisons <p> When the Mississippi legislature met in special session , it was supposed to deal with prison overcrowding . But the get-together in August quickly into a get-tough-on-criminals frenzy . Egged on by Republican Gov . Kirk Fordice , who proposed what was dubbed the " Glint Eastwood Hang ' em High Bill , " the lawmakers decided they were tired of " coddling " prison inmates . They voted to yank individual television sets from prisoners , ban air conditioning , prohibit weight lifting equipment and-in the biggest throwback-dress inmates in striped uniforms with CONVICT stamped across the back . The fact that none of these measures will likely deter crime was beside the point . " We want a prisoner to look like a prisoner , to smell like a prisoner , " said state Rep. Mack McInnis . " When you see one of these boogers a-loose , you 'll say , ' I did n't know we had zebras in Mississippi ' . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't alone . From Albany to Sacramento , lawmakers have discovered that bashing prison inmates is this season 's easiest and most disingenuous way to exploit voters ' anti-crime sentiment . Ohio , Wisconsin and North Carolina , among others , have enacted or proposed bans on telephones , televisions , basketball , boxing , wrestling and martial arts . California , eroding the Jerry Brown-era " Prisoners ' Bill of Rights , " is charging inmates $8 to initiate court actions and has banned R-rated movies . South Carolina has banned conjugal visits for minimum-security inmates , ending a 50-year tradition . New Jersey is considering a " people 's prison " where inmates would do 10 hours a day of hard labor , with no educational programs , no gyms , no TVs . Congress has also struck a blow against crime , eliminating educational grants for federal prisoners . Says Jonathan Turley , director of the Prison Law Project : " It 's difficult to imagine a measure draconian enough to satisfy the public desire for retribution . " <p> In this election year , the politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAC , so it 's a no-brainer for elected officials to display anti-crime resolve by cracking down on prison conditions . Indeed , Some of the action is symbolic . Louisiana passed a law banning martial arts in prison even though it offers none . Mississippi banned conditioners though few inmates have them . Many proposals were offered but did n't pass . Still , supporters insist that making prisons harsher will somehow deter crime . " Knowing there 's no televisions here , maybe they 'll think twice before committing a crime , " Sgt. Dan Smith of Clay County , Fla. , suggested to The New York Times after the Sheriff 's Office removed TVs from county jails . Others maintain that prison life has grown soft and too inviting for some down-and-out people . " We have ! too many benefits and too little punishment , " says New York state Sen , Michael Nozzolio , who wants to revoke scholarships for prisoners . Although studies show education is one of the few programs that cuts recidivism , Nozzolio says : " We have lifers getting two and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deterrant Factor : Critics say those arguments simply add up to mindless retaliation . There 's no evidence that something like banning TVs will give pause to someone contemplating , say , a drive-by shooting or a walk-by mugging . " Does anyone really believe that taking away a television is going to affect the crime rate ? " asks David Rothman , a Columbia University historian of American prisons . How about barbells , which are a particularly popular target for get-tough lawmakers ? Citing the 1993 riot in Lucasville , Ohio , where prisoners used barbells to smash a cinder-block wall , legislators argue that bulked-up inmates cause too many problems in and out of prison . Experts scoff at this contention . " We have n't seen any 98-pound weaklings bulked up into 210-pound behemoths who rob and rape people , " says William Turner , a San Francisco lawyer who has won several suits forcing states to clean up their prison systems . And , inmates say , weight lifting acts as a tension-reliever . As one parolee in Wisconsin explains : " People that lift iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and lift , and they do n't cause no problems . They 're so big , no one wants to mess with them . " <p> With most prisons already dangerously overcrowded , wardens and experts worry that idle inmates are dangerous , first to other convicts , but also to prison staff . Prisoners are " like kids who need an electronic babysitter , " says New York state correctional spokesman James Flateau . Just ask Harvey Garlotte , 36 , who is serving a life sentence for murder in the South Mississippi Correctional Facility . He says that last week guards began confiscating private TVs . Most of the individual TVs are in death row , psychiatric wards and isolation quarters , leaving only communal areas where dozens of inmates can gather to view one set . Claims Garlotte : " If they 're going to take the TVs and all , things are going to blow apart . " <p> Changing conditions : Do barbells and TVs really amount to coddling ? . To a prisoner in the 19th century , complaints the likes of Garlotte 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell and a Bible and not much more . But the definition of acceptable conditions has changed with the times . In the early 1900s leg shackles came off and athletics were allowed as part of " normalizing " the prison . After World War II rehabilitation was the buzzword , and by the end of the 1960s the Supreme Court established certain minimum rights for prisoners , like the right to worship , hold property and contact lawyers . But since the 1970s the notion of rehabilitation has lost Found . While for some inmates prison is a shelter from urban streets , a place where they can get three square meals and clean clothes , few people who have studied prisons would contend that even the nicest ones are pleasure domes . Says Turley , " We no longer pretend to have a prison policy other than retribution , no philosophy other than warehousing . " And after the new laws , a pretty bare warehouse at that . <p> PHOTO : Look like e prisoner , smell like a prisoner ' : Convicts in Georgia detailed to perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; The U.S. prison population set another new record last year , breaking 900,000 for the first time .
