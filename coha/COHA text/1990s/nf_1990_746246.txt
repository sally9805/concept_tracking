Outlining endures as a prewriting technique because it helps some writers organize their thoughts . Unfortunately , too many students prove daily that beginning with an outline does not ensure unified writing . To help my students write more effectively , I developed a technique for writing from thesis statements that requires that students create a picture of a wheel . The hub of their wheel is a word or phrase that holds the essence of what the student is trying to say ; the spokes are the concrete examples that will support the claim made in the thesis statement ; and the rim is the thesis statement that allows the wheel to move . <p> This technique works for my students because it enables them to visualize what they are trying to say before they put their thoughts on paper and leads them to the outline as a secondary rather than a primary step . It is equally effective for paragraphs , for essays , and for term papers . In this article , however , I will show how the wheel can be used in writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce an integrated term paper . <p> I introduce my students to the writing wheel technique by engaging them as a group in the prewriting , writing , and rewriting of a paragraph . The following is a scenario for a typical class session . <p> First , I ask students to give me a word  --  any word . Someone might say , " Television . " Then I will ask for a one-sentence statement that makes a claim about television . By asking for a claim , I am guiding my students to look for evidence to support their claim . I have found this works well in helping them to understand the nature of the concrete support required in the body of their paragraph , essay , or term paper . <p> A student may respond with something like this : " Television revolutionized political campaigning . " I call this sentence a thesis statement and say , " This is what we are going to prove . " I then draw a large circle to represent the rim of the wheel . Around its edge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have our rim , but nothing to support it . We could add the spokes , but without a hub , we have no way of holding them together . Before putting the spokes in place , we need to find a hub . <p> To help my students determine what this hub is that holds the whole wheel together , I ask , " What one word can you not remove from the thesis statement without changing the whole meaning ? " A student might say , " Revolutionized . " So I take it out of the sentence  --  " Television blank politiical campaigning , "  --  and they see that omission does not completely change their argument . The next word selected might be television . We check that  --  Blank revolutionized political campaigning  --  and it becomes obvious that none of our evidence now fits because we could be talking about fax machines , women , or the weather . Television is the one word that is absolutely essential to make this argument , for it contains the essence of everything that we are saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel . <p> Now we are ready to find the spokes that will help support the rim . I allow the students to argue the case . Because I think this exercise provides them with an opportunity to generate new ideas , I write every argument on the board . After the well has run dry , I go back to the thesis and , comparing it with the evidence given , ask , " How many of these supports would truly convince the jury ? " We erase those items that are not effective arguments , and we are left with those that we think are good ones . These become our spokes . <p> With the rim , hub , and spokes in place , the wheel is ready to roll ; our paragraph is ready to be formed . The next step is to tie the wheel in to the standard outline form . " The Preacher Model " <p> To communicate the parts of a paragraph , essay , or term paper , I use the old analogy of the preacher who says : " Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the proof of what I 'm telling you ; and , just so you 'll remember what I 've told you , I 'll tell you once again . " I tell my students that the rim is both what " you 're going to tell them and what you 've told them " and that the spokes are " the proof of what you 're telling them . " <p> This image provides the base for allowing the students to connect their visual wheel to the traditional , abstract outline form that I then introduce . <p> I. Thesis statement  --  " This is what I 'll tell you . " <p> II . Body  --  " Here 's my proof . " <p> III . Conclusion  --  " This is what I 've told you . " <p> From here , we generate the first draft of the paragraph as quickly as I can write it on the board . Producing the Unified Whole <p> After I get this draft on the board , I illustrate how essential rewriting is by allowing them to participate in the transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is where the hub word or phrase really comes in handy . With each sentence , I ask , " What does this sentence have to do with television ? " By using transitions or by rewriting the sentences somewhat , students are able to make the paragraph cohere . <p> They frequently find this the most exciting part . As one student said during an in-class writing session , " It makes me feel like a magician who can bring order out of chaos with a wave of my wand . " I especially like this quotation and this experience of in-class rewriting , which show that revision can be fun . <p> With this simple wheel illustration , I am able to lead my students into writing first the paragraph and then the longer essay . I reiterate the model with each assignment until it becomes second nature for them to write from a thesis statement with the hub word or phrase as their focus . The term paper presents an additional challenge , however , because it requires them to integrate the ideas of others . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students how to summarize scholarly journal articles . By summarizing articles , students become adept at finding the essence of the author 's meaning and stating it in their own words without adding personal opinions . To facilitate objective summary writing and reinforce the writing wheel concepts , I created the guide shown in the side-bar . When students become skilled at writing objective summaries , they are ready to start work on their term papers . The Thesis Statement <p> For my students , their term paper process starts when they settle on the thesis statement that will form the rim of their writing wheel . Although , in some cases , students may change or modify their thesis statements as they discover more about their subject , beginning with one statement narrows their search sufficiently so that they avoid the problem so common to a deduced thesis statement : the attempt to stuff too many facts under one flimsy umbrella . <p> The statement must be a claim , and it must be stated with an active verb in order to lead to livelier writing in the final form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam engine was important " ( no claim , thus no argument ) or " The steam engine was the most important discovery of our age " ( a claim , but a colorless statement ) , say " The steam engine destroyed pastoral life " ( a strong , actively stated claim ) . This statement becomes the rim of the term paper wheel , and it helps pinpoint the hub of the wheel , which is a key to a unified term paper . <p> The hub is the word or phrase that can not be removed from the thesis statement without changing the essential meaning . Steam engine may be selected as the hub phrase in the above thesis statement because removing it would completely change the context of the claim as an individual student understands it . Once this hub phrase is selected , it is written in the center of the wheel ; and it serves as a unifying guide for the researching , prewriting , writing , and rewriting of the term paper . With this lodestar , students can begin the research for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scope of this article , I will now skip to the research products : summaries and spokes . Before beginning any work on their term papers , students write a specified number of paragraph-length summaries of the articles they will use in writing their papers and from which they will determine the spokes of their wheel . On the botton of each completed summary page , they must include the bib liographical information in the correct form . This expedites the writing of the final bibliography without needlessly duplicating work . <p> If an article will be quoted or paraphrased , I ask students to photocopy at least the page to be cited and to underline the section to be used in supporting their claim . This streamlines their work by cutting out the traditional step of copying quotations on index cards , and it increases the chance of accurate citations . Also , any section underlined should suggest one or more of the spokes of their wheel . As the evidence grows , cross-numbering the spokes and their corresponding underlined quotations allows students to integrate their evidence visually before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in place and the summaries are completed , students write their outlines . <p> In writing the outline for their term papers , students use the " preacher model " mentioned earlier , and their papers will mirror this format . In the introduction section of their papers , they know that they must state their thesis . In the body , they know that they will give their supporting and contradicting evidence , allowing at least one paragraph for each discrete bit of support ( which is frequently a synthesis of many of their research sources ) . In the conclusion , they must summarize what they have said , without adding any new information . With this knowledge and with their summaries , underlining , and wheel , they can produce good , detailed outlines that will serve as guides for their term papers . <p> Outlines have long been used by writers to organize their thoughts before writing . Many students , however , find this process too abstract . For them , the writing wheel supplies the means to unified and integrated writing by making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaigning <p> By COLLEEN RAE <p> <p> COLLEEN RAE teaches writing at Santa Fe Community College in New Mexico . <p> WRITING SUMMARIES <p> GRAPH : Writing Summaries <p>
