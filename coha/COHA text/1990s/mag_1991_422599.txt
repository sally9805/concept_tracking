<p> LET HISTORY SHOW THAT 1991 WAS A most excellent year for movies . Not ! You do n't have to live in Wayne 's World to hoot and hurl at that bogus claim . The vast majority of films this year were memorably , indefensibly atrocious . Though the estimated $4.7 billion box-office take is the third largest ever ( following $5.03 billion in 1989 and $5.02 billion in 1990 ) , the figure is misleading . Simply put , there were more movies at higher admission prices . With the average film 's selling fewer tickets and costing a staggering $26.2 million to produce and an inflationary $16.6 million to shove down our throats through marketing , Hollywood has n't felt this pinched since the prevideo Stone Age . <p> Everybody is pointing fingers : The critics blame the studios for grinding out mindless pap ; the studios blame the recession for reducing audience spending ; the audiences blame rising ticket prices ; and George Bush blames Congress , which he blames for everything . Meanwhile , we 're left sifting for clues to explain how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at the top moneymakers , however , would suggest the formula stuff still works . Two star-driven action epics - Terminator 2 ( $200 million ) , with Arnold Schwarzenegger , and Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves ( $164 million ) , with Kevin Costner - struck pay dirt . Two star-driven thrillers - The Silence of the Lambs ( $135 million ) , with Jodie Foster , and Sleeping With the Enemy ( $100 million ) , with Julia Roberts - also delivered , as did one star-driven comedy , City Slickers ( $120 million ) , with Billy Crystal . <p> But look closer : Action did n't help The Rocketeer , F/X2 , Toy Soldiers or Flight of the Intruder . Star-driven action fared even worse - the overproduced Hudson Hawk , with a smirking Bruce Willis , was a fiasco to rank with the dregs of any year . And does anyone remember Point Break , with Patrick Swayze , V.I . Warshawski , with Kathleen Turner , or the infantile Mobsters , with Christian Slater ? Exactly . Most star thrillers - A Kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Berenger , and Deceived , with Goldie Hawn - failed to thrill . And comedy had a rotten year . It was n't surprising that Sylvester Stallone ( Oscar ) , Ellen Barkin ( Switch ) , Demi Moore ( The Butcher 's Wife ) and Kim Basinger and Alec Baldwin ( The Marrying Man ) could n't cadge a laugh . But there 's no making excuses for such real comics as Steve Martin ( L.A. Story ) , Mel Brooks ( Life Stinks ) , Richard Pryor and Gene Wilder ( Another You ) and especially Woody Allen and Bette Midler ( Scenes From a Mall ) . <p> Movie sex also went limp in 1991 . Most signs of erotic interest ended in rejection ( My Own Private Idaho ) , betrayal ( Thelma &; Louise ) , breakup ( Jungle Fever ) or death ( Barton Fink ) . Michelle Pfeiffer and Al Pacino spent so much time arguing about condoms in Frankie and Johnny that they both lost the mood . Madonna settled for going down on an Evian bottle in Truth or Dare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pee-wee Herman may have been the only ticket buyer who got turned on by a movie this year , and he was arrested . <p> Things turned grim when the studio experts tried to tailor films for a strapped economy . Demi Moore went from being a yuppie banker 's pampered darling in Ghost to working in a tacky Jersey beauty parlor in Mortal Thoughts . Instead of hooking a Prince Charming and shopping on Rodeo Drive , as she did in Pretty Woman , Julia Roberts hired on as a nurse for a terminal case and dressed down in Dying Young . It was a year in which glamorous Michelle Pfeiffer was a bone-tired waitress and Al Pacino a short-order cook in Frankie and Johnny ; Don Johnson was a shrimper and Melanie Griffith a simple hausfrau in Paradise ; and Robin Williams ( The Fisher King ) , Mel Brooks ( Life Stinks ) and Jim Belushi ( Curly Sue ) joined the ranks of the homeless . Fantasy-starved audiences were crushed by this onslaught of harsh reality ; there was n't a mega-hit in the bunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Silence of the Lambs to Beauty and the Beast , movies reflected the buzzword for relationships in 1991 : dysfunctional . In Silence , Jodie Foster 's FBI trainee runs an obstacle course of dysfunctional males , including a patronizing boss ( Scott Glenn ) , a leering shrink ( Anthony Heald ) , a sexually confused serial killer ( Ted Levine ) and , above all , a perversely fascinating cannibal ( the incomparable Anthony Hopkins ) . Even in the G-rated territory of Disney 's Beauty and the Beast , the heroine must care for an addled father , fend off a boorish suitor and see the worth in a hairy , snorting , selfish male monster . <p> Dysfunction took many forms : sexual ( Rambling Rose ) , marital ( Sleeping With the Enemy ) and parental ( The Prince of Tides , My Own Private Idaho ) . There were also impairments relating to race ( Homicide ) , religion ( The Rapture ) , fame ( Truth or Dare ) and diet ( Eating ) . In the psych-speak understatement of the year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consciousness investigation together and honesty sharing . ' She was talking about her pal Barbra Streisand . But her words catch the tone of the New Age swill that Hollywood has been asking audiences to swallow . These days few would be surprised to read an analysis of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II as a case study in codependency . <p> In no other year were movies so obsessed with how things go wrong ; that 's only fitting , since the movies were going wrong themselves . Did Hollywood turn to its best filmmakers for a solution ? Dream on . The corporate takeover of movies was complete in 1991 ; executives made the creative decisions . For a while this year , it seemed as if all the problems at Sony Pictures would be solved when chairman Peter Guber lured his buddy Mark Canton from Warner Bros . The media , including the great gray New York Times , reported the story as a major news event . It did the same when Disney 's Jeffrey Katzenberg issued a January memo bemoaning spendthrift budgets and when Paramount chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studio bosses rivaled stars in fame and income . <p> In 1991 , business became the show . Windfall profits from ancillary markets ( video , pay cable , foreign theatrical and TV ) , which provided a cushion against risk in the mid-Eighties , flattened out this year . More than ever , a film 's box-office performance determined its success elsewhere . The sliding scale has made studio bosses cautious . They want to make fewer movies at a lower cost . And they want hits . <p> Audiences want the same . Or do we ? The balance-sheet mentality has altered our perception of what makes a hit and a flop in the Nineties . Though the top-grossing chart for films is a more effective measurement of marketing success than filmmaking quality , audiences increasingly want to see what everyone else is seeing . By that standard , Costner 's stunted Robin Hood is a classic , and the Coen brothers ' provocative Barton Fink is crap . <p> This leaves the studio bosses frantically trying to find what draws the public to a movie so they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In The Devil 's Candy , her wickedly informative book on the making of the mega-flop The Bonfire of the Vanities , Wall Street Journal reviewer Julie Salamon shows executives madly straining to turn Tom Wolfe 's spiky novel into a palatable bonbon . The casting of comedian Tom Hanks as bond trader and Master of the Universe Sherman McCoy heads the list of inane executive decisions made in the name of likability and empathy . <p> In case you 're wondering how studio bosses know that audiences prize likability and empathy , the answer is a blight on artistic expression called focus groups - preview screenings at which recruited audiences fill out questionnaires on the movies they 've just seen . As a result , scenes are sweetened , deleted or reshot , new endings are added , and fewer films wind up making a lick of sense . <p> Still , the dark side of human behavior managed to filter through some 1991 movies . Males showed their feelings for women through exploitation ( Deceived ) , abuse ( Sleeping With the Enemy ) , mutilation ( Silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murder ( A Kiss Before Dying ) . He Said , She Said was n't about the Clarence Thomas-Anita Hill hearings , but the title spoke to the matter of mistrust between men and women . To rattle cages in an era of rampant sexual harassment , filmmakers championed the killer in the woman and the child in the man . <p> Guns in tow , Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2 and Anne Parillaud in La Femme Nikita blew away male predators with cathartic impunity . In Thelma &; Louise , Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis also used violence to plumb the anger and frustration of women who struggle to change male attitudes . But the image of women as victims persists . In Cape Fear , the rapist played by Robert De Niro speaks to a lawyer ( Nick Nolte ) about his own rape in prison : Have you ever been a woman , counselor ? Some fat , hairy hillbilly 's wet dream ? I learned to get in touch with the feminine side of myself - the soft , nurturing side . ' <p> Macho contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came from male weepies that only a focus group could love . In Regarding Henry , Harrison Ford has to get shot in the head to realize he 's been neglecting wife Annette Bening ; in The Doctor , William Hurt needs to have his cancerous larynx removed to appreciate Christine Lahti ; and in The Prince of Tides , Nick Nolte must relive an adolescent trauma in the office of psychiatrist Barbra Streisand before he can be a nurturing husband to Blythe Danner . Like disciples of psychologist John Bradshaw , these men are reclaiming the inner child - Ford clutching a puppy , Hurt writing love notes to his wife on a blackboard and Nolte blubbering in his shrink 's arms . <p> The real progress for women in film this year came behind the camera - women were directing in greater numbers than ever before . Jodie Foster ( Little Man Tate ) , Barbra Streisand ( The Prince of Tides ) and Lili Fini Zanuck ( Rush ) drew the most attention by working within the studio system . But outside the mainstream , Martha Coolidge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at My Table ) and Jennie Livingston ( Paris Is Burning ) really delivered the goods . The independent circuit also helped to bring us such strong films as Gus Van Sant 's My Own Private Idaho , John Sayles 's City of Hope , Mike Leigh 's Life Is Sweet , David Mamet 's Homicide , Matty Rich 's Straight Out of Brooklyn and John McNaughton 's film of the Eric Bogosian monologue Sex , Drugs , Rock &; Roll . Foreign films found the search for intelligent life in the audience even tougher , but pleasures abounded in Claude Chabrol 's Madame Bovary , George Sluizer 's The Vanishing , Agnieszka Holland 's Europa , Europa , Luc Besson 's La Femme Nikita , Pedro Almodovar 's High Heels , Akira Kurosawa 's Rhapsody in August and Wim Wenders 's Until the End of the World . <p> Of course , it was n't all trash floating in the mainstream . Jonathan Demme reinvigorated the thriller in the movie of the year , The Silence of the Lambs . Screenwriter Callie Khouri and director Ridley Scott showed how a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Thelma &; Louise . And the Coen brothers used old Hollywood to offer darkly witty insights into the creative process in Barton Fink . Even the Mickey Mouse studio broke its flop streak with the thrilling Beauty and the Beast , a classic animated feature that represents Disney artistry at its peak ( and you do n't have to bring a kid to have fun ) . The studio system also introduced the gifted John Singleton , a writer-director whose Boyz n the Hood was a potent look at black life in South Central L.A. <p> But these were drops in an ocean of mediocrity . With visions of profits and Oscars dancing in its head , Hollywood points to the Christmas season , featuring Steven Spielberg 's Hook , with Dustin Hoffman , Robin Williams and Julia Roberts playing fairy-tale characters ; Oliver Stone 's JFK , with Kevin Costner playing a conspiracy theorist ; Barry Levinson 's Bugsy , with Warren Beatty playing a gangster ; Barry Sonnenfeld 's Addams Family , with Anjelica Huston playing Morticia ; Lawrence Kasdan 's Grand Canyon , with Kevin Kline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chill ; Lili Fini Zanuck 's Rush , with Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh playing narcs ; and Howard Zieff 's My Girl , with the boy prince of box office - Home Alone 's Macaulay Culkin - playing the victim of ( say it is n't so ) a lethal bee sting . Of course , last Christmas also boasted a promising array - Havana , The Russia House , The Sheltering Sky , Hamlet , Come See the Paradise , The Bonfire of the Vanities . <p> Hollywood continues to preach blind optimism , but how many kinder , gentler Terminators , politically correct Robin Hoods and male-bonding city slickers can we take ? The studios are so determined to turn the Nineties into a good-news movie decade that they even have die-hard film mavericks thinking commercial . The bracingly cynical Terry Gilliam ended The Fisher King with a series of cheery anticlimaxes ; the classically adventurous Kenneth Branagh switched from the tragic sweep of Henry V to the tepid romance of Dead Again ; and the formula-busting Martin Scorsese overrode his own misgivings to try an all-star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fink , Joel and Ethan Coen cleverly drew a bead on this problem . Though Fink ( John Turturro ) is a pompously solemn New York playwright , the studio boss ( Michael Lerner ) who has brought him to Hollywood wants him to write scripts loaded with that Barton Fink feeling , ' an intangible that the mogul mistakenly thinks will make audiences laugh , cry and break out in joyous song . ' But the only feeling Fink has is one of pain and desperation . Trying to write about anything else drives him into creative paralysis and madness . <p> The Coens are laughing , but it 's gallows humor - their films do n't generate box-office heat , so their next assignment is always iffy . And the battle between integrity and compromise may get bloodier as money becomes tighter . The movie lineup for 1992 is a jamboree of safe bets , led by Home Alone Again , Batman Returns and Lethal Weapon 3 . It 's enough to give studio bosses hope that the box office will bounce back in 1992 . It 's enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Photos : <p> In The Silence of the Lambs , ' Jodie Foster finds an affinity with the male monster ( Anthony Hopkins ) ; in Beauty and the Beast , ' Belle sees beneath the surface to the man inside . <p> Photos : <p> Male wimps and female warriors ( clockwise from top left ) : Regarding Henry , ' Thelma &; Louise , ' The Prince of Tides , ' The Doctor , ' La Femme Nikita ' and Terminator 2 ' <p> By PETER TRAVERS <p> VIDEO <p> IT WAS N'T WHAT MOVIES YOU WATCHED AT home that mattered in 1991 ; it was how you watched them . Theater-quality sound and picture could be approximated in your living room if you were willing to cough up a few extra bucks and do a little tinkering . Okay , the home theaters in the video magazines were far more artfully designed than most amateur setups , where players , monitors , tangled wires and speakers of every size , along with mountains of tapes , discs and instruction manuals , created a look of high-tech chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV room as booby trap . But ah , the payoff . Hook up a VCR and a television to a receiver and five external speakers , and the surround sound you get from popping in a tape of Oliver Stone 's biopic The Doors can almost make you forget the film 's dippy-hippy I do n't know how to spell this , but we 'd like to leave it hippy-dippy Do you mean you 'd like to leave it dippy-hippy ? yes . nonmusic scenes . Play the laser disc instead of the tape , and the picture will rival the sound for depth , clarity and brightness . <p> Laser technology really hit its stride this year . About 12 million movies on laser disc will be sold , doubling the 1990 total and generating $300 million in revenues . Variety reports that in a home-video market whose profits have generally flattened , laser is the main growth area . Of course , VHS proponents are quick to dismiss the threat of laser . VHS is a $10 billion a year industry , the big kahuna . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . <p> Laser releases are traditionally customarily delayed three months or longer so as not to interfere with video sales and rentals . Kevin Costner 's Dances With Wolves has just arrived on disc , but the tape has been around since August . To make matters worse , nearly eight percent of the record 655,000 tapes of Dances had to be returned for replacement . To fit the three-hour movie on a single cassette , the manufacturer used thinner tape , which has a tendency to slip , twist or snap after several plays . Laser is more durable and less costly ( a $100 tape is usually around $30 on laser ) . It 's also been touted as the best way to watch movies at home by such directors as Martin Scorsese ( Raging Bull ) , Peter Bogdanovich ( The Last Picture Show ) and Danny DeVito ( The War of the Roses ) , who have made special laser editions of their best movies with audio commentary , outtakes , reference materials and production stills that tape ca n't provide . <p> It 's war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we never switch to laser . Discs will continue to make further technical refinements , and tape will rush to catch up . Tape reissues this year of Citizen Kane , Spartacus and Disney 's Fantasia - uncut , in their original shooting ratio and with supplementary materials - indicate the industry is aware that sophisticated consumers will no longer settle for shoddiness . If high-definition TV becomes a reality in the next few years - giving us laser-caliber picture and sound on regular broadcast television - things will only get better for the home entertainment consumer . <p> Now if that consumer would only bring his or her passion for technical quality to questions of content and distribution . If you want to know what went wrong with video in 1991 , head over to your local tape hangout and check the action . Chances are the place is spacious and antiseptic - the recession and competition from the big chains and discount centers have made those cozy mom-and-pop specialty houses as much a relic of the Eighties as Beta tapes . What we have now is more product and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next few weeks your video store will probably have one wall stacked with Terminator 2 tapes , another with Robin Hood : Prince of Thieves and a third with boffo comedies - City Slickers or What About Bob ? or The Naked Gun 2 1/2 . The remaining space will go to Disney favorites , top attractions from earlier in the year ( Ghost , Home Alone , Dances With Wolves ) and the all-time champs , starting with E.T. , Batman and Pretty Woman . <p> But if you live outside a major urban center , just try finding a little 1991 movie that you meant to see ( Straight Out of Brooklyn ) or that great old B picture ( Pickup on South Street ) or a foreign classic ( Children of Paradise ) . Inquire about those and clerks will act as if you dropped in from what Murphy Brown calls the planet of Oh , Yeah , Sure . ' In 1991 a sad truth sank in : Video has become as desperately hit driven as the movies . What used to be an exhilarating alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . <p> Not surprisingly , this is partly a result of economics . The mid-Eighties were a banner time for video ; supply could n't begin to meet the demand . Before video , a feature film 's box-office take had to be two or three times its cost to break even - only twenty percent of movies hit the mark . Video revenues raised that figure to seventy percent . Each VCR household now spends $163 on tape rentals and purchases per year . VCR penetration is at a whopping seventy-six percent . Funny thing , though - a recent study shows we 're using them less . In the current economic slump , the video business - which grosses twice as much as the box office - has leveled off . In 1991 , retailers even began to report shrinking profits . <p> The recession is not the only culprit . When a big picture is available , say a crowd pleaser like Home Alone , the public suddenly has money to spend . So in 1991 the video industry turned itself into an event enterprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Home Alone to rent to their customers , they now bought a hundred . Forget that the budget for that extra fifty copies used to be spent on lower-profile movies . These are tough times . Though box office in 1991 was hurting from so many flops , video could cut its losses by reducing the number of losers occupying valuable shelf space or drop them altogether . Video chains became like bookstores that only stock bestsellers . Good for business , sure , but what 's to read ? <p> The way we use video changed fundamentally in 1991 , but the impact has only begun to be felt . Less than a decade ago , the potential of video as a resource seemed limitless . The lower price of a rental - typically a third of the cost of a movie ticket - encouraged us to take a chance on movies we never would have tried at the box office . Some movies were practically discovered on video ( The Terminator , Stop Making Sense ) ; others had their reputations bolstered ( Raging Bull , Blue Velvet ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck a chord , we could find an earlier work at our fingertips . If we entered a video store looking for E.T . and did n't find it , we might browse and take home a golden oldie . <p> Now we 've gotten out of the habit . The film past holds little interest - it 's new or nothing . Most movies now arrive on video as early as three to six months after their theatrical release . These days , with Hudson Hawk , The Marrying Man and He Said , She Said leading the parade of turkeys , it 's no wonder we 're not renting in record numbers . But if the hits-only mentality has spared us a lot of cinematic grief , it has also cheated us of those movies that fall between the cracks . They include some terrific recent movies that never made a buck ( Robert Altman 's Vincent and Theo , Peter Medak 's Krays , Bob Rafelson 's Mountains of the Moon ) , interestingly flawed movies by gifted filmmakers ( Spike Lee 's Mo ' Better Blues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Strangers ) and films by new directors without major-studio clout to market their work ( Charles Burnett 's To Sleep With Anger , Tom Stoppard 's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead , Norman Rene 's Longtime Companion ) . In short , the kind of movies that allow for risk and growth . <p> In a recent speech at a video conference in Toronto , LIVE nt. comp uses all caps Home Video president David Mount warned that reducing the breadth of choice could eventually hurt business . It 's depressing that we sold more of The Punisher than of Mountains of the Moon , ' said Mount . We need to promote quality films to ensure that home video continues to provide the consumer with variety . ' It 's not just the stores that have quit stocking these quality films ; we 've quit asking for them . Without a video call to arms - and soon - those movies will no longer be made , leaving us literally home alone . <p> Illustration : ( JONATHAN ROSEN ) <p> By PETER TRAVERS <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
