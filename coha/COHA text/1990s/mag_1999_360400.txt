You may drive out Nature with a pitchfork , yet she will always hasten back .  --  Horace , Epistles <P> Pitchforks ? Nowadays we use guns . A so-called gene gun using gold bullets has become one of the standard methods for rewriting nature 's codes . Pellets coated with DNA are fired into the chromosomes of a plant that biotech engineers wish to alter in some amazing way . Then , after patient cultivation to bring out the inserted trait , a prodigy is born . The transformed crop may be corn or cotton with a built-in insecticide , tomatoes that retain their fresh-picked texture on the shelf , or wheat with extra gluten , making for lighter , bouncier bread . The new crop of doctors has been so busy re-enacting the Creation in the past few years that Americans , at least , no longer pay much notice . If genetic engineers had envisioned a quick conquest of the world , however , they have experienced a sharp comeuppance in Europe , where fears about the unknown consequences of " Frankenstein foods " are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to take up pitchforks on behalf of Mother Nature 's return . <P> From a global standpoint Europe 's resistance to genetically modified crops is a peculiar case : a complex amalgam of bad timing , conspiracy theories and allegiance to traditions , with perhaps a dash of economic protectionism thrown in . Yet the Continental food fight that continues to pitch up scare headlines in Europe may herald what genetic engineering can expect to encounter as it moves more broadly into pharmaceuticals and medical procedures . It 's not just a matter of consumers ' smelling something very fishy in the idea of tomatoes given an antifreeze-producing gene from the winter flounder . More broadly , society  --  at least European society  --  is beginning to view genetic science as a market-impelled juggernaut out of control and wearing moral blinders . <P> The notion of science as a Faustian enterprise is deeply embedded in the popular psyche , even in the relatively optimistic U.S. Technologies that tinker with the fundamentals of life can inspire anxieties enough ; when increasingly wedded to the profits of Big Business , the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , America 's most persistent critic of bioengineering , wonders what is in store for a world in which evolution is treated as a plaything and life as an " invention . " A case in point : the announcement in November by Advanced Cell Technology of Worcester , Mass. , that it had hybridized human DNA with a cow egg . Says David Magnus , director of graduate studies at the University of Pennsylvania 's Bioethics Center : " It 's an example of an issue that requires deep , careful thought . Instead , there was a race to get it done as fast as possible , because there were commercial benefits . "
