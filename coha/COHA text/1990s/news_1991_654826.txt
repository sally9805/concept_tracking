<p> A ROOM OF ONE 'S OWN Adapted by Patrick Garland from the book by Virginia Woolf . Directed by Mr. Garland . Starring Eileen Atkins . At the Lamb 's Theatre . A ROOM of One 's Own " distinguishes the season with a work of irony , intellectual passion , and depth of human feeling . Working from the book by Virginia Woolf , adapter-director Patrick Garland has distilled into an evening 's entertainment Woolf 's reflections and convictions about the role of women in literature and society . Yet far from being a case of feminist pleading , the one-woman show at the Lamb 's Theatre is notable for its reasonableness , good sense , and lack of aggression . <p> Depth of feeling is there all the same and all the more evident in Eileen Atkins 's enactment of Woolf - a combination of precise portraiture and persuasive eloquence . With introductory voice-over assists , the British star approaches the stage from the back of the auditorium .

For a woman to write , she must have an income of 500 pounds a year and a room of her own . The obstacles to achieving this not very remarkable state of independence lead " A Room of One 's Own " down innumerable paths and bypaths . The first is quite literal . Woolf reports that as she strayed onto a university lawn , she was waved off by an imperious beadle . He serves as the first symbolic figure of many men who have kept women off turf reserved for males only . <p> Here are some typical examples of Woolf wisdom : " Why does Samuel Butler say , ' Wise men never say what they mean about women ' ? Wise men never say anything else apparently ... Possibly when the professor insisted a little too emphatically upon the inferiority of women , he was concerned not with their inferiority but with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me one night about the same time that the act was passed that gave votes to women ... Of the two - the vote and the money - the money , I own , seemed infinitely more important ... Indeed , if woman had no existence save in the fiction written by men , one would imagine her a person of the utmost importance ... In fact , as professor Trevelyan points out , she was locked up , beaten , and flung about the room ... The history of men 's opposition to women 's emancipation is more interesting perhaps than the history of emancipation itself ... " <p> All of this and so much more is delivered by Atkins with the conviction - and eloquence - it merits . The actress does n't attempt a literal transformation into the Woolf image , preferring rather , with her casual suit and loosely knotted tie , to achieve a period Bloomsbury look which admirably serves the purposes of the portrayal .

THE Speed of Darkness " is a dramatic hybrid - part mystery , part tragedy , part angry indictment of society 's complicity in the evils of pollution and war . Steve Tesich 's symbolic new play starts out as a plain-folks South Dakota couple awaits the post-midnight return of their teenage daughter Mary from a date . Even this scene hints at the turbulence in store . <p> In the course of Act 1 , Joe ( Len Cariou ) , a successful construction man , seeks to reassure nervous young Mary ( Kathryn Erbe ) as she worries about the big change in her life that will follow high school graduation . But Joe has troubles of his own , momentarily centered on his choice as one of four candidates to be South Dakota 's " man of the year . " He dismisses wife Anne 's ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he has responded to his fellow citizens ' attempt to honor him . Joe has also positioned himself against local opinion by opposing a real estate development atop a neighboring mesa . No one can understand his resistance to the project . <p> No one , that is , except Mr. Tesich . The playwright gradually probes a series of troubling events stretching all the way back to Joe 's service in Vietnam and beyond . The wounds from which he still suffers are reopened with the arrival of wartime buddy Lou ( Stephen Lang ) , whose life Joe saved in combat . In his own good time , the author sheds devastating light on the dark secret they share . <p> Revelations come gradually . Nor do they end with the fatal act that produces the evening 's most stunning climax . A final disclosure - in this case concerning Joe 's and Anne 's relationship and the parenthood of Mary - fills in the pieces of the jigsaw plot . <p> The performance staged by Robert Falls exploits the tensions inherent in the script .

It is a powerhouse performance in a powerful work . He is well matched by Mr. Lang as the appealing veteran whose homelessness adds to the drama 's social dimensions . As Joe 's womenfolk , Miss Eichhorn and Miss Erbe heighten the play 's emotional appeal - Eichhorn as the cherishing Anne and Erbe as the apprehensively sensitive Mary . Robert Sean Leonard gives a tactful but discerning performance as Mary 's boyfriend . " The Speed of Darkness " is fraught with symbols , from the make-believe " baby " that Mary carries with her to the dim outlines of the mesa in the background of Thomas Lynch 's set ( murkily lighted by Michael S. Philippi ) . Merrily Murray-Walsh designed the costumes . <p> " The Speed of Darkness " is the first venture by the recently formed Broadway Alliance , an association dedicated to encouraging the production of straight plays at some of Broadway 's well-appointed but lesser-used playhouses .

Directed by Mrs. Allen . Starring Tracey Ullman . At the Plymouth Theatre . WITH Robert Morse nearing the end of a prolonged engagement in " Tru , " Jay Presson Allen 's evocation of Truman Capote , Mrs. Allen has been helping ready yet another piece of solo stage biography . <p> The new reminiscence , written in collaboration with daughter Brooke , concerns Florence Aadland , the mother of Errol Flynn 's teenage inamorata . Entitled " The Big Love , " it takes place in Los Angeles in 1961 and stars Britain 's versatile , award-winning Tracey Ullman . <p> What you see is pretty much what you get at the Plymouth Theatre : a chatty pop piece in the vein of fan magazines , gossip columns , tabloids , and TV talk shows ( but with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authentic as her blowsy persona , Miss Ullman 's Florence reflects on an affair that began with Flynn 's rape of the 15-year-old Beverly and continued as a sort of three-way relationship which Florence more or less stage-managed and chaperoned . <p> She insists that only the star 's death prevented him from marrying her daughter . <p> The nearest Flo comes to apologizing for her delinquency ( for which she was briefly jailed ) is to rationalize what happened on her own amoral terms . The rationale includes references to " a Rosicrucian lady " who assured the compliant divorcee that " everything is ordained .
