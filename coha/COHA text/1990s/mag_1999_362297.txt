Five ... four ... three ... two ... one ... see ya ! " And Chance McGuire , 25 , is airborne off a 650-ft. concrete dam in Northern California . In one second he falls 16 ft. , in two seconds 63 ft. , and after three seconds and 137 ft. he is flying at 65 m.p.h . He prays that his parachute will open facing away from the dam , that his canopy wo n't collapse , that his toggles will be handy and that no ill wind will slam him back into the cold concrete . The chute snaps open , the sound ricocheting through the gorge like a gunshot , and McGuire is soaring , carving S turns into the air , swooping over a winding creek . When he lands , he is a speck on a path along the creek . He hurriedly packs his chute and then , clearly audible above the rushing water , lets out a war whoop that rises past those mortals still perched on the dam , past the commuters puttering by on the roadway , past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cry of defiance , thanks and victory ; he has survived another BASE jump . <P> McGuire is a practitioner of what he calls the king of all extreme sports . BASE  --  an acronym for building , antenna , span ( bridge ) and earth ( cliffs )  --  jumping has one of the sporting world 's highest fatality rates : in its 18-year history , 46 participants have been killed . Yet the sport has never been more popular , with more than a thousand jumpers in the U.S. and more seeking to get into it every day . It is an activity without margin for error . If your chute malfunctions , do n't bother reaching for a reserve  --  there is n't time . There are no second chances . <P> Still , the sport 's stark metaphor  --  a human leaving safety behind to leap into the void  --  may be a perfect fit with our times . As extreme a risk taker as McGuire seems , we may all have more in common with him than we know or care to admit . Heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orgy of thrill seeking and risk taking . The rise of adventure and extreme sports like BASE jumping , snowboarding , ice climbing , skateboarding and paragliding is merely the most vivid manifestation of this new national behavior . Investors once content to buy stocks and hold them quit their day jobs to become day traders , making volatile careers of risk taking . Even our social behavior has tilted toward the treacherous , with unprotected sex on the upswing and hard drugs like heroin the choice of the chic as well as the junkies . In ways many of us take for granted , we engage in risks our parents would have shunned and our grandparents would have dismissed as just plain stupid . <P> More than 30% of U.S. households own stocks of some form or another , whether in investment accounts , mutual funds or retirement plans , up from 12% just 10 years ago . While an ongoing bull market has lulled us into a sense of security about investing , the reality is we are taking greater risks with our money than any other generation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step further , buying " speculative growth , " i.e. , highly risky Internet and technology stocks , breezily ignoring the potentially precipitous downside.
