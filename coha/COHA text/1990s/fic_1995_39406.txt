These are the facts as my father told them . In the old country during the Second World War , in the forests and villages of Czechoslovakia west of Brno , a man named Machar , or Machac , made a name for himself as a smuggler , moving entire families across the Moravian border near Trencin , then across Slovakia to Hungary where others would take them on . His was the first and most dangerous leg in that human relay , a route as treacherous for its mazework of forest paths as for the fields and towns and cemeteries that stitched the landscape tight and close ; windows were everywhere . <p> But Machar could do what others could not . He was the son of a lesnik , a gamekeeper and expert woodsman . It was said that he knew the Moravian landscape as no one else ; that he would move through the forests of spruce and fir , the mustard fields folded into the hills , use them to his advantage , with the thoughtless surety of an animal ; that in winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with snow , and no moon or stars , he would find his way by the changing shape of sky showing through the trees . <p> From time to time word would come back from those he had helped across . This was of no small importance . Refugees were easy prey : They brought everything . No one knew they were going . No one would know if they did n't arrive . And every spring , bodies would thaw out of snowbanks all along the Hungarian border , coatless , shoeless , gold fillings wrenched from their mouths . Unlike some others , apparently , Machar would not steal or kill . <p> My father said he thought he might have met Machar himself in 1938 , the spring before Munich . It was in Zdar . My father was stationed there , a member of the officers ' corps put in charge of organizing the local militias . Machar ( if , in fact , it was Machar ) was a powerful , not over-tall , awkward man . A peasant , slightly stupid , instinctively suspicious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , generally unwilling , hands hidden in the baggy pockets of his gray canvas pants , giving not the slightest indication of hearing , much less understanding , anything being said . The only reason my father noticed him at all was that Machar was already known in the region south of Hlinsko , in a small way , as something of a curiosity , an anatomical freak . Although the rest of his body was normally proportioned , his hands , apparently , were monstrous : not misshapen or hideous so much as simply outsized to the point of deformity . My father never saw them himself since the man by the wall never took his hands from his pockets . <p> But his hands alone would never have been enough to pull the man up from the floodplain of obscurity . Nor would his work as a smuggler have done so . Machar was an unlikely candidate for sainthood : gruff , uncommunicative , pathologically intense , frightening even to those he helped . The only reason anyone ever had cause to recall Machar at all was a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1944 . In January of that year , in a scene so unlikely , so ridiculously dramatic it had to be true , Machar , while leading a family with three small children at night through the forests south of Bosany , was surprised by two German soldiers on either side of the trail . One only had time to yell , Halt ! Wer da ? before Machar had seized them both around the neck , pressed his huge thumbs into the soft space beneath their chins , and snapped their spines like a pair of spring rabbits . He lay them in the snow along the trail , and the group continued on . A testament not to bravery but to outrageous brute strength , the explosive fuel of fear . In any case , it was enough . His name , for a short while , flickered in the great dark ; then it , too , went out . <p> The war ended ( quietly , ambiguously , like the fine breath of rot raised by a thaw ) exactly on April 26 , 1945 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet tanks bucking across the soaking fields , just one man on horseback , a Cossack , at dawn , watching only his own slow passing in the dark windows , riding slowly up Zeyrova Street to the foot of the vineyards , then slowly back . <p> After him came others , two : three at a time . This was the liberation : no regiments , no heavy artillery . Nazi snipers still held the hills outside Brno . At night they would pick off the silhouettes of the Soviet soldiers against the fires of boards and bench slats blazing in the road until some of the men , my grandfather among them , could n't stand it anymore and went out and said for the love of God stay to the side , why die for no reason ? And apparently , the story goes , one of them looked up from where he squatted by the flames , then out into the vague darkness my grandfather had indicated , then back to the fire . Da nicego . Nas mnogo , he said . There are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the man spoke again , not looking up from the fire . Hide your women , old man . We 're not the last . <p> The havet , the vermin ( General Malinowsky 's troops ) came later . Spina , my father called them , dirt , the after-scum of the general army : illiterate , ragged , undisciplined , many of them two and three years on the front . They moved through from the southeast , a bestial tide , monstrously unpredictable , unafraid to die . Some , like stunned children , were capable of small , absurd gestures of generosity . Some gobbled toothpaste , squeezing it on their bread like pate . My grandfather , hearing the sound of breaking glass and the crash of piano keys , carne downstairs to find one , pants pulled down around his ankles and rifle by his side , using the Austrian baby grand as a toilet . When he was done , he left . Some raped a ten-year-old girl . She died . Four months later , they were gone . <p> By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London . By winter , the free press had returned to Czechoslovakia . And Machar was out of work . He went back , as far as anyone knew , to whatever it was he had been before the war . He disappeared . <p> The rest is almost too thin to tell : it offers no resistance , takes no shape . It slips through the sieve like water . Some remembered that Machar had worked in the strojirna , the factory , in Zdar . That he drank . That he had a foul temper . That he married a woman from Trebic , and that the marriage for some reason had gone bad . Some recalled hearing about his father , a lesnik , a gamekeeper , tortured and killed by poachers sometime after the first war . <p> A man from Javornik whom my father once met on a train claimed he had heard that Machar had escaped to Vienna after the Communist coup in 1948 . Or maybe to Munich . That he had returned across the fences for his wife . Another time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugee camps near Innsbruck in the winter of 1949 , where intellectuals and journalists threw bricks to each other to roughen their hands and improve their chances of being farmed out for laborers ' jobs in Australia and Brazil . That he had returned to Czechoslovakia years later . Alone . That he 'd been living , a broken man , somewhere near Jindrichuv Hradec . <p> My father shrugged . Lives are such baggy things , he said . Sometimes there are pieces left over . He looked out the window , not seeing the snow , the trees , the burdened wires . That 's all , he said . <p> But of course it 's not . In death as in life we push against the universe of facts , make a space , force our way like pups to a teat . And the world adjusts . Eternity , such as it is , is in the echo . Our lives continue to sound long after we are gone . <p> MY STORY <p> Years before I had heard of Machar , sixteen years , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me what he remembered of a man he had probably never met , a drunk in a green Trabant dropped me and a woman I had been living with at a crossroads not far from Telc , Czechoslovakia . It was a hot , late afternoon in July of 1974 . We were hitchhiking back to Brno and from there to Vyskov , to visit her parents . All day long she had been picking herbs along the wayside ; they filled the hue shoulder bag she carried with her everywhere she went . She smelled like herbs . She was naked under her crumpled skirt and loose cotton sweater . She had fine golden fur on her legs and arms and stomach , and a small white scar on her left breast . We were both giddy with making love . Neither of us could remember eating anything and neither of us was hungry . I was not yet twenty-two years old . <p> With the sun still high in the poplars bordering the road , we started down a long hill thick with the smells of manure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fresh sweep of water . We seemed to unfold the season as we went . By the time we reached the bottom she was glad for the sweater . A fast , clattering stream ran behind the village along the base of a steep hill , then cut to the center and under the main road . We stood on the bridge and listened . Except for the water and the bark of a dog , everything was quiet . In the little town of white houses with clay-colored roofs and small , cramped gardens , I soaked my head under a pump while she went into a store to ask directions . She came out with two bottles of sticky sweet , yellow limonada . We drank them sitting on the rim of the well . The last bus would be coming through in an hour . A few doors down , apparently , there was a woodcarver 's studio . I cupped my hands and drank some water . <p> There was no sign . It took a while for him to open the door , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , close eyes . A growth of white chest hair , stark against his reddened skin , sprouted from his unbuttoned woolens . Ano ? he said , stooping slightly forward under the door frame , one hand behind the half-opened door , the other propped behind the wall . She explained why we 'd bothered him . He stared at her , mouth slightly open , rocking forward with each labored breath , until she started to say it again , then reached for a set of keys and shuffled past us down the walk . <p> A stone path , sunk into the earth and overgrown with weeds , ran along the house , then bisected a poor , shady garden with kohlrabi and radishes and a few ragged heads of lettuce . A chicken on the gate of a wooden fence turned nervously , then squawked to the ground . We passed through to a thick-walled shed , plastered and rude , maybe five meters square . He unlocked the door , the key clinking minutely against the steel , then moved aside <p> We stepped into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep and off-plumb , a cracked cement floor , rough pineboard shelves running the length of the walls from floor to ceiling . In the center , a hardback chair and a small table . The carvings , arrayed like infantry , lined the walls . Of the hundreds there , perhaps a dozen were of square-legged horses or faceless turtles or small , moored rowboats with pencil-thin oars . The rest were devils . Some were medieval , with straight , ropy hair and chiseled faces , sharp as an ax . Some were fat , grinning , tall as my forearm . There were small groups of miniatures , each the size of a man 's thumb , with horns as tiny as a grain of rice . <p> Me znaji ve Vidni , he said suddenly from the doorway . They know me in Vienna . He stopped , standing away from the wall like a rooted tree , hands in his pockets . I nodded . Very nice , I lied . My friend nodded her agreement . This one 's wonderful , she said , gently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wood had dried badly . A small crack ran lengthwise from the nape of the neck , halfway down the back . He did n't say anything . <p> I brushed past her , pretending to be absorbed , and walked further along the wall , wondering how soon we could leave and whether we would have to buy something . I could feel the way her sweater slipped easily over her skin . I wanted to be outside . <p> In the end we bought a carving and left . I 'm not even sure who picked it . We missed the bus that afternoon and ended up walking away from the road , straight through patchy woods and briar tangles and across small streams thick with stinging kopriva to a place by a deserted cow pond , where we made love on our clothes laid out like a crazy blanket against the stickers . Afterward we left the crushed space we 'd made and waded around in the over-warm water , no more than thigh deep , and splashed and laughed . <p> I inherited the statue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquent , and I almost believe I remember noticing it that first time , wedged there between those ranks and battalions of devil , no more than a foot in height : the deformed figure of a man , grotesque , almost abstract , with huge , amphibious hands and feet , kneeling in supplication before an unseen judge , his head forced to his chest as though crushed from above , like Jesus on the cross except that rather than nailed to the horizontal wood , his hands , monstrous and heartbreaking , reach out ahead , palms out , as though begging forgiveness , or offering themselves as explanation for some irrevocable wrong . <p> It has been four years now since my father , noticing the statue perched precariously on the edge of the living-room bookshelf , began talking of the war and a man named Machar , or Machac , who was said to have huge , outsized hands and whom he thought he might have met once over half a century ago . And I remember the man at the door , the grizzled cheeks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and I have no way of knowing if it was him . <p> The odds are less than small . I never actually saw the old man 's hands . There was nothing in his face or manner . The town we had found ourselves in that summer afternoon was nowhere near Jindrichuv Hradec , the town Machar was said to have returned to . And , not least , my father had always been a storyteller , a magician for whom even the most sober handkerchiefs tended to burst into tropical bloom at the slightest provocation . Perhaps there was no Machar . Or perhaps he was a composite of other men , of other stories overheard , misread , misremembered , from a war already half gone to fiction . Perhaps all I had , all I would ever have , was a wooden statue with hands as round and deep as a pair of catcher 's mitts , chosen from a roomful of demons by a woman I 'd once known and cared for . <p> At the end of every life is a full stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the story is only a fragment . It is up to us , the living , to supply a shape where none exists , to rescue from the flood even those we never knew . <p> We all , like beggars , must patch the universe as best we can . <p> THE WOODCARVERS TALE <p> As Frantisek Machar was being born into a wooden room thick with the smell of lamp oil and women 's sweat , the brittle shelves of ice that covered the ruts on the roads sloping to the river were caving quietly under a hard March rain . Streams and rivulets threaded the meadows , gushed into roadside gutters , dug tunnels beneath old snowbanks , and swept on . The river loosed and groaned . The midwife cleaned up the mess and lowered the lamp . On her way home , she flung the afterbirth to the pigs . It was 1915 , the second year of the war . The little boy was the son of the village lesnik . It would be a year before the father returned from the front . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the others who survived : tough , resistant , slow to cry and quick to forget . By the time he was five , he was spending his days in the forests with his father . They would rise at dawn in the cold . If it was raining , he would look down at his shoes walking up the dirt road and listen to the rain drumming on his hood like fingers on a wooden table . To keep his direction , he watched his father 's legs , the black huntsman 's boots with the heavy wool pants tucked in at the top , his father 's hand with the tufts of black hair on each finger curled around the heavy , big-bore rifle he had brought home from the war . Where the road ended , the two of them would climb up through the soaking grass , away from the town , the river , to the fogged silence of spruce and pine . <p> In the forests the rain seemed only a distant kissing , a spray of mist across his face . The needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk , he listened , and his father 's voice ( low , clear , rough as a pine burl ) seemed measured to the place , to the creak of trees , the spaces between the wind . <p> This , rather than any desk or pew , was his source . To him , the things his father 's voice explained or touched were scripture ; the questions , the answers , a forest catechism ; every blood-tipped quill , every broken reed , every flash of color in the gloom , a parable of survival or death . What about this ? Machar 's father would say , indicating a yellow-stemmed mushroom prodding up to the air , a cap of loam still perched on its velvety head . And the boy would have to recite what he had learned : no skirt , no sheath , gills burnt orange and closely layered , swollen like pages left in the rain , a smell like crushed walnuts ... Dobry , he would say . It 's good . And his father would dig beneath the loam with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down his thumb would touch the rim of a ghostly sheath , thin as membrane . Eat this you 'll die , he would say to the boy . Remember that . <p> Years of stories build around a core of fact . If a skrivanek burst from the edge of the meadow , his father would point out the flash of yellow on the underwing , the looping glide . They 're nervous , quick to fly , he would say . When you see one , be careful . They tell you something 's moving . That flower , bright as arterial blood ? It 's Vlci Mak , the wolf poppy . Eat the bulb at the center for pain . And he told him about Petr Vaculik , a logger from Rasna , who , crushed by a freak fall , a wrist-thick branch jammed through his body like a spear , had walked out of the forests on a bent-limb crutch , eyes like a saint , his mouth and chin dark with pollen , a bouquet of crimson poppies clutched in his bone-white hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the company of wood . His father 's saw raining softly , piling small hills of dust : orange , pink , white . The boy would run his fingers over the crosscut , reciting , pith , heartwood , sapwood , bark . The pith was the eye , he knew . Heartwood was next , bone-hard and dead . Sapwood was lighter : living cells that shrink and warp . It would clasp the saw , admit the chisel , endure badly . Oak had clean , well-defined rings . It was strong , flexible , hard to cut , held the nail like a mother her child ... Ash had a clear border , a frontier between heart and sap . Beech was reddish-white throughout : no heart , or sometimes a false one , soft and unworkable . Good , his father would say , when he had done well . Remember it . <p> And he would . He would remember it all : the long days , the grasses frozen in the meadows at noon ... He would remember his own legs trembling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speck of mica in the blue above the hills , how his dreams would be filled with the sad soughing of trees and the burbling of water and his father 's voice asking , What is it ? What are they saying ! and him knowing he could answer , easily , without effort , forever . <p> They found the severed head of the buck the week before he turned seven . His eyes had caught the dull light of bone before he saw they were teeth , drawn back from the gums , before the head itself had leaped into shape . It rested on the blood-soaked ground in a blue tangle of guts , just off the trail . His father squatted beside it . Poachers , he said . Fanning away the iridescent cloud with the barrel of the rifle , he turned the head carefully over , then turned it back . Looking up , he squinted off into the near distance of the forest . The poachers had left it there for him . To think about . <p> His father did n't speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deflated , made no more of than what it is , stood , picked a sturdy stick off the forest floor , and jammed it into the cavity of the neck . Hoisting the thing over his shoulder like some ghastly parody of a vagabond 's sack , he set off straight across the woods , the boy following , until the random streams of ants crossing and recrossing the trail grew thicker and faster and there , fifty meters ahead , stood a swarming , chest-high mound of needles set against a spruce . Machar stood there beating the ants off his shoes with a fir branch , watching his father walk steadily toward it , carrying that grisly offering . When he touched the buck 's head to the mound , the darkness boiled up like a cloud . <p> He was eight when the poachers roped his father to a hill just like it in the forests outside Branna and the world should have jarred on its axis , the sun struggled to rise , but nothing happened . The river ran , the rain fell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one spoke to him about it . But he knew . And the lesson seemed clear : evil was everywhere , in the sheath on a mushroom , the opaque eyes of a butchered buck , and if you let it in the door , if you died , if things went wrong , it was your fault , your failure . The evil , in some dim way , was yours . <p> No one told Machar this ; he figured it out himself , as he thought his father would have wanted him to . In the spring he and his mother moved away , boarding the train to Brno with a suitcase each , Machar carrying his father 's death like a peach pit lodged halfway down his throat . It was in town that his hands , big and floppy as a puppy 's since birth , first became a burden to bear . At home there had been the usual fistfights ; here his hands seemed a particular curse , and he dragged them on like a badly anchored ship through the tedium of school ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years at the prumyslovna , the technical institute , then the scrojirna in Jdar . When the war came , he did what he did without thinking about it much . The work of a smuggler came easily to him . And then the war was over . <p> The peace was nothing . The country gasped for air like a swimmer caught in heavy surf , only to be buried again . Machar married his wife in January 1948 . The coup came on February 24 . On April 9 , young Masaryk , Czechoslovakia 's last hope of a return to the days of the first republic , plunged seven stories from Cerninsky Palace to the cobbles . Machar 's son was born the next winter . <p> He came first for her , true , but it was for him that Machar left , crossing the open farmlands south of Mikulov to Drasenhofen , then through the Soviet zone to the English sector of Vienna . It was for him that he cut through the fences , at that time still free of electric current , slipped past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark toward the Austrian oil fields gusting up like candles in the distance . <p> Like a fox ferrying pups , he brought her across , then crossed again , running the gauntlet , returning one last time across the still , February fields , eleven hours each way , for the pinched red face that did not know him , the wisp of black hair , the tiny spastic arms , softer than anything he had ever known or would again in this life . He wrapped him in a gray blanket and started back . The baby was sick . He cried , his small , animal wail sounding through the muffled pines . Terrified , Machar held him close to his chest with his huge hands and crashed on through the crusted snow . It was not until dawn , crossing a vast , white field ridged and furrowed by wind , that he stopped and unwrapped his hands from around the quiet bundle he had held for hours in the warm cave of his coat . It . took him a long time to realize the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marble down a long , dark tunnel , and then there was only silence . And voices , somewhere , trying to talk to him . She left sometime later , and he did not try to stop her . It was his fault , he knew , his utter responsibility and guilt , just as it had been his father 's , except that his father 's mistake had been fast and final and killed only one ; Mach 's had taken three . He would stop now , on roads , in doorways , his face suddenly collapsing like a child 's that has been struck for no reason , and remain there , long after the pain had gone , with that surprised , inward look of a man still listening for the murmur of his own dead heart . For a time he existed in the refugee camps near Innsbruck , then , having nowhere else to go , returned to Czechoslovakia , alone . <p> When he returned he was arrested , though no punishment had ever meant less to a man . The nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads , fought when he had to . On a warm September afternoon , the bus dropped him off at the crossroads , and for the first and also the last time he walked down that long hill and over the bridge with the water clattering below . The house was owned by an uncle he had met once as a boy . Years ago he had heard he was living here . He took Machar in , then died . When no one came to claim the house , Machar stayed on . <p> And time built its slow rings around his guilt , hardening pain into truth . When a weasel slipped through the coin-sized knothole in the wall of the chicken house , he read the lesson in the carnage of feathers and blood . He saw it in the torment of a mole batted about by a cat on the front walk , tossed in the air , batted again . In the squeal of piglets eaten by the sows , in the demonic grunting from the pen . <p> It was not long after Machar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the splitting log . He turned it slowly , suddenly remembering his father cupping big handfuls of wet sawdust to his face , breathing in the rough perfume . It seemed to him that in the dead solid shape of the heartwood was the suggestion of a face , and he went to the shed for a chisel and hammer , took out his pocketknife , and started hacking him free : small , straight horns , curved nose almost touching the thick upper lip , the rude first progenitor of many generations to come , truer and more lasting than the generations of men . <p> And that is where he would stay , alone , unbothered , not well but not dangerous , frightening only to children who like being frightened , staggering on under the weight of his days until the morning he tried to rise from his chair at the table and found he could not , then laid his head on the wood by his half-eaten breakfast and died . <p> And yet this could not have been all . Months earlier , there was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other afternoon , in the workshop , moving carefully through the living cells to the dark striping of the heart . There would be no salvation here . No love . No redemptive vision of midges suspended above the river and naked children swimming till late in the flatwater by the dam . Only mercy , perhaps : unbidden , emerging as of its own volition with each lifting curl of the unshaped wood , revealing to him , as though for the first time , the faces of those who had worked his father free , beating at the black swarm moving up their arms and legs , then wrapped him in burlap and carried him home ; those for whom his father 's death had been meant as a warning . Those , so like his father , after all , who did not listen . Who did not know how . <p> It would come back to him in a rush : the woodshed the day after his father 's funeral , filled to the roof with cedar , oak , even apple wood , aged , split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there would be something hung out back , out of reach of the dogs : a pair of ducks tied at the neck , a pheasant , a whole leg of venison . And the old coin sack filled with toys : miniature pinecone owls with button eyes , twig feet , and wings of leaves ; hazelnut mice with hair whiskers and tiny rope tails ... and sitting there , watching his huge hands doing their work , old Machar could almost hear his father 's voice : remember them . <p> And he would remember now too the hand lost in his like an egg in a nest , the one he had dropped that night as he lunged for their throats , the softness under his thumbs coming up against the bone , the clear crackling as of branches when he brought the strength of his shoulders to bear through his forearms , his wrists ... <p> And that is where I leave him , years before my life would cross his , in a bare room thin with wind , outside the small pocked window shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves gathering against the clutter of fences and catching in the tangled gardens , he not hearing the bang and bang and bang of an unpainted shutter calling the river to frost , not seeing the small aromatic drifts of shavings gathering , spilling off the gullied lap of his blue canvas pants to his shoes ( set far apart and sad like the facing cornerstones of some vast , unspared mansion ) , from them to the cracked and broken floor , knowing only that emerging from the palmed wood was not the same familiar shape , the monotonous affirmation of his guilt , but ( see the head bent low to the chest like a resting child , the bending back , the aching , cross-hatched ribs , those huge and haunted hands , palms outward , supplicant ) his brave and broken self . <p> Mark Slouka is the author of War of the Worlds : Cyberspace and the High-Tech Assault on Reality , to be published by Basic Books in August . <p>               @ @ @ @ @ @
