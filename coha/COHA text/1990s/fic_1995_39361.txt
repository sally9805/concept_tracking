Black/White <p> The blastoff , followed by the disappearance of the projectile , took place on a night when Venus was visible very close to the moon . It was like the beat of a black swan 's wings . And in a flash he saw Simone sit up in bed and shield her face with her arms like a child trying to ward off a blow . Then she fell back into the bedclothes . And he thought that Simone and he were dead . <p> But the alarm clock and a splash of water were all it took . Under the brisk drumming of the shower , their bodies were reborn . And they reached out for mugs of strong coffee . For a moment , it 's true , he felt nausea at the sight of Simone sitting there munching toast . He touched her arm cautiously . She was warm and smiling as she picked up her glasses and the newspaper . <p> As soon as she has gone he starts to search the whole bedroom . He shakes quilts and pillows . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smoothes the sheets . Retrieves underwear from the floor . Unwinds a tangle of tights and briefs . Shakes the shoes she 'd worn . <p> That it should happen in this very bedroom where they fell in love , partly because of the shining apricot bedspread , the well-stuffed black chintz cushions , and the big jar of white iris and palm leaves that was not included . Even so , it came to almost 100 a month . The 3,000 was just for the bed . But the agent knew a friendly bank . And at that moment , it was the dream of their two bodies that counted . Light and relaxed . Floating on this unlikely bed . <p> He still remembers how her face glowed that day almost five years ago . Cold , heat , and sex all colored her skin a delicate pink . Her face was still slightly fleshy and she knotted a white silk headscarf in a way that made her cheeks narrower , and her part shone milky white . In certain lights an almost holy face and a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost unnaturally thin . <p> And : " Never tell me you love me , " she whispered . <p> " Why ? " <p> " Because it would change us into other people . " <p> And : " She 's a calm lake , " he said when his friends found her dull . <p> But now it seems you can fire off a revolver without waking her . She merely submerges herself deeper into sleep with the quilt pulled over her head and her back turned to him . And her skin  --  even if he touched her , she would be unapproachable . <p> No , they certainly do n't come in anymore with light steps and plastic bags bulging with fruit and shellfish . Not to mention slim bottles of wine and roses wrapped in cellophane with long curled ribbons . <p> Simone comes to a standstill in the kitchen as if she 's sunk into some kind of trance . Then she lets her handbag and the carrier drop to the floor with a thud and starts to rub her fingers , cramped from carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , Simone ? I 'll buy enough for a week at a time . " <p> " Then I ' 11 have to make lists and remember everything each time . That 's much worse than going to the shops . And anyway , I do n't buy on impulse . " <p> She ca n't forget the two sweaters of virgin wool . A find at the price . Especially when it 's his style anyway . <p> " Borrow them whenever you like . Try on the red one . It looks good on you . " <p> But she pulled at her blouse and showed him the design of the sleeve . A batwing sleeve , she said . " Women do n't wear men 's pullovers anymore . It 's completely out of date . You know very well it is . " <p> That put an abrupt damper on his pleasure . <p> She picked up a square pack of cod , unwrapped it and almost hurled it into the pan . <p> No . No long-stemmed roses and bubbling wine . But Simone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen food all the time ? <p> Because at least then there are no scales on the fish . <p> Perhaps she already knows he 's been fired . <p> She 's gotten so tight , almost miserly . <p> Buy the big earrings , Simone . The ones with the long black tassels . They remind me of well-groomed ponies and circus princesses . If you tie your hair back . You look exotic . <p> But no . <p> When she does go to the shops , it 's on her own . As if buying things were a secret investment or a crime . The thin straw-yellow blouse and the old-rose silk jacket that ruin her color . She chooses gentle spring shades although she is winter with her pale skin and lavish dark hair . Dramatic colors suit her . But she loves the dusty ones that make her disappear , as if her sense of her beauty has no connection with what she really is . <p> He remembers she once took a whole quarter of an hour to select a postcard . She finally decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreground , the bluish-pink flowers of a Japanese cherry . And behind its branches a meadow of golden wallflowers and iris . She took the picture solemnly from the stand . And even while she was writing on it , she turned it over and admired it . As if she could make herself disappear beneath the blossoming branches . The corners were scruffy when she finally slipped it into its matching blue-gray envelope . Even notepaper she buys only after careful consideration . <p> Once again he opens the narrow drawer that slides so soundlessly that it seems to have been made to hold a secret . The revolver is still there . Picked up dirt cheap or out of fear . <p> But actually he did n't feel any fear . More like curiosity and amazement when the man had held the weapon out to him with a tentative movement as if he were collecting money for some charity . He took the two-hundred kroner notes out of his wallet as easily as he signed his name on a list . And he looked up at the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny worn gold teeth in his lower jaw . He might have been his own age . Maybe slightly older . He had dark hair , long in back . You could n't see whether it was greasy or just streaked with sweat . <p> " I do n't dare keep it any longer . " The man 's hands were shaking as he took the notes . <p> Brown eyes . A long face . A ribbed knitted scarf , olive-green . <p> His memory is worse than usual . Perhaps because it was on that day he was fired because of lack of business . The day they had had only one customer in the shop . But a good customer . An elderly gentleman with a little pot belly that was easy to camouflage . His hair was thick and such a glassy brown it might have been dyed . And he combed it as soon as he thought he was unobserved in the fitting room . <p> He was going on vacation , he said . And he was easily swayed . He forgot his " Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in warm colors in a casual style that made him look slimmer and gave his movements the attractive ease of youth . <p> He 'd brought out the character of the man . And he can still describe that customer , right down to the color of his socks . But the salesman . The man with the revolver . No more than a ribbed scarf . <p> When he was on the bus , standing hemmed in by furs and backpacks , he thought of going to the police . He thought everyone must hear the weapon scraping against his lunch box . He got off to buy a newspaper . But there was nothing in it about guns . <p> And now , as Simone sleeps her heavy sleep , he opens the drawer . And the cool weight in his hand sets off images . <p> He stands in a nameless bank , waiting like everyone else . But when he gets to the counter , he is no ordinary customer . He 's one of those people who shove a note and a plastic bag through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't know . The blood rushes to her face and then immediately drains away . She is close to fainting as she hands him the bag . Her lips are wide open , her eyes shining as in an act of love . <p> He runs . And Simone sits in the car , quite unaware . But she is tearing her hat to pieces . " Loves me , loves me not , " she whispers as the artificial petals fall . Because today she wears a hat . <p> " Stop it , Simone . " Nervousness makes his voice brutal . <p> She looks at him with her big gray eyes ; there 's a tiny green splinter in the left iris . <p> And then . <p> He and Simone on a beach . <p> The setting sun is gold on the water . Simone 's pale skin takes a faint green cast . The shadows fall on her shoulders and make her shiver with chill . But he is burning . On the first day he 's already caught the sun . His body attracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the restaurant . The duty-free perfume drifts around her shoulders . Lobsters lie prone on their plates . There 's the scent of rosemary , marjoram , and the little vases of pinks on the tables . Orange peel twists like long ribbons down to the floor . And the headwaiter himself , in his gold lame jacket and a mustache like a walrus , comes to lean over their table . He 's needed only a swift glance to take in the gold credit card that 's valid in every restaurant and shop . <p> The most select menu is placed before them . But he waits to order the wine until they have finished the thick fruit juice they start with . We delays until the waiters grow uncertain and bring a basket of dusty , specially selected bottles . And Simone 's tongue is burning with spices already , she is about to ask for water when he finally decides on the sparkling white and the full-bodied red . <p> There is wine left in the bottle when they leave . They want to dance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or snow-white leather . The light flows gold around her breasts and shoulders . There 's a scent of leather and exotic flowers . They dance in tight embrace . And their feet find the way to their room of their own accord . Perhaps someone knocks on the wall . But they do n't hear . They make wild love , intoxicated with wine and perfume . And they hear only the rolling of the waves and maybe the nightclub drums as a soft throb up through the floor and their bodies . They sleep relaxed , light . <p> As planets or birds approach each other , he thought . And he tried to push his foot between her legs . But she slept as if invisible cords bound her ankles . She does n't even bother to trim her pubic hair . He can twist it around his finger like a ring . A woman of twenty-six ca n't possibly be so tired . It must be something in the air . A kind of allergen . But one day they will brush it off , shake it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be light . <p> He hears her steps . He can picture her slim ankles on the stairs . She moves as if weightless . She has a bunch of yellow flowers in her hand . She almost throws herself on the bed and looks up dizzily with wide eyes . <p> " What is it , Simone ? " <p> " Put them in water . " She holds the flowers out to him . " Sleeping daffodils . The whole town is full of them . They 're so pathetic . They 're in big boxes . They must have been cut with a scythe . " <p> He searches around for a vase big enough . Three bunches with thin rubber bands around the stems . The flowers ' heads bend forward ; they are greenish yellow and juicy in a strangely fleshy way . <p> He runs his fingers through her long dark hair . There is a small damp spot , and she gets up so quickly that he feels a shock through his whole body . <p> Like a round shadow flower floating on dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . A chalk flower that bends downward easily on the stem of her neck . And in the X ray he 'll be able to see her fillings , and in the convoluted patterns of her brain  --  perhaps the missing bullet . <p> Summer with Oleanders <p> My mother lay in the bath with the door open so she would n't drown . Her head floated like a lovely , slightly withered flower . She had put so many pine needles in the bath that her body was invisible . Time after time , she fell asleep and apparently woke up when her ears started gurgling and her mouth filled up so she sneezed like a fountain . <p> At last she stood up with a splash . Swathed in three towels , she held her thin nylon underwear up to the light before putting it on . The tiny lace briefs and the bra that pressed slightly into her flesh . <p> I knew Uncle Ole was coming and that I was going to be looked after by Aunt Camilla , who had become my aunt by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath my dignity to be looked after . At summer 's end I would be ready for school or at least have reached mandatory school age . I did n't know which was worse . One sounded as if you were a pear cut in two with a sharp little knife . The other sounded like closed rooms and feet dragging through gray mornings . <p> I drew flowers , butterflies , and stars on my nails with a mauve pencil . My mother tweezed hairs out of her eyebrows . That made her sneeze too , so the flower on my index finger went all the wrong shape . She kissed me on the cheek as if she were busy . I knew she did n't like me studying how she drew lines round her eyes . So I sighed in as grown-up a way as I could , slung my jacket over my arm , and rang the bell next door . <p> Aunt Camilla let me in and put an apple into my hand . Her friend Antoinette , who had become my aunt too , had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had a technique of holding the apple at chest height and slicing it at lightning speed into such thin slices that it hardly needed chewing . <p> They had a special pair of scissors for grapes too . They even peeled the grapes and picked out the seeds . And in the park we always ate pears on a special bench . I got a pear to myself , while they shared on a napkin . Some of the pears had soft golden flesh and juice that ran between your fingers . Others were hard and tasted something like wet china . <p> But everything about Camilla and Antoinette was special . There was the bonbonnire , with delicacies like chocolate ginger , French bonbons , tiny pastel-colored peppermints , and toffees with white stripes in them . <p> When we went out , they wore coats they called " housecoats , " and they had special names for colors . " Isabella-colored " was a special yellow named after a queen who 'd peed in her lace knickers . " Ecru " was when you spilled tea on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all stains that were delicate . <p> My knowledge of school came from them too . Especially something about a hysterical teacher who smacked naughty children 's fingers with a very long ruler until their nails fell off . Both Camilla and Antoinette had nails . Especially Antoinette . They were pale pink and shiny , and there was a little half-moon on each nail . Perhaps the moons came from beatings . I did n't dare ask . But I knew she polished her nails on a tiny leather cushion . For some reason , that was more refined than using lacquer . <p> I knelt in the armchair and looked at the flowers Camilla had been given . The red oleander had come out . <p> " Now do n't touch them , Dearie . They 're poisonous . You can use them for rat poison . Now you know . " <p> She had told me this at least a hundred times . And yet it was impossible to imagine that something as charming as those pale pink posies could have anything to do with rats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little ? I did n't feel anything . The armchair was springy beneath me and left flower patterns on my knees , and its armrests and back were covered with white embroidered antimacassars like clothes on an overdressed baby . <p> " Are you getting bored , Lovey ? " Antoinette put down the knife and wiped her mouth on a napkin . <p> " Intelligent people never get bored , " Camilla said firmly , before I had time to reply . <p> After that , we put our coats on right away , so she obviously did n't consider me very intelligent . This disappointed me , but still I looked forward to the outing . For even when we were out walking , we went to especially select places . When I was little , I had been with the aunts to some very special floral exhibitions , where a man in a long black coat talked to the flowers while all the grown-ups sang or cried . But I did n't know the songs , and I 'd nothing to cry about , so I just enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white box . The only snag was that you were n't allowed to take a bunch home with you , even though they would just be thrown away afterward . <p> I told my mother about the beautiful flowers and the man and the songs . <p> She shook her head . And I thought it was over the greediness with the flowers . But we never went to that kind of thing anymore . I had to make do with the park , where Aunt Camilla stole cuttings and Antoinette tried to train the birds with the aid of dry bread cut into tiny squares . <p> " Now , now , you 've had your share , " she would say , looking sternly at a particularly cheeky sparrow . <p> " That 's a cockbird , " said Camilla , as if that explained everything . <p> Their favorite was an ugly little pigeon with only one leg . And Antoinette always brought a buttered roll or other especially nice treat for it . Sometimes she cooed a little , as if she wanted to teach it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . The others were there . The cheeky cocksparrow . The bird that was hardly full grown . The one with a white feather on its wing . The blue-gray pigeon with red-rimmed eyes . The rare chaffinch . The blackbird whose boldness bordered on impudence . And the gulls , circling and circling before diving suddenly down and making all the other birds take off on their mite-infested wings , as Aunt Camilla said . Mites were something like lice . She had read that all birds had them , though you could n't see them . That was why she always moved her feet around with little jerks every time one of the pigeons was getting really tame . <p> Aunt Camilla was impatient . By the way , she had to stop in at the pharmacy , she said . We could just stay on the bench and wait for her . She walked off very energetically , and I was sure she was going to steal cuttings . It was n't really stealing she said . It was almost a kind of game . And anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " But the shame of it , " said Antoinette . " We might be banned from the park . " <p> " Not for life , surely , " Camilla said . <p> We waited , but the pigeon did n't come . Perhaps it did n't dare to because of an old man who sat down beside Antoinette after first asking : " Madame has no objection ? " <p> Antoinette had a blue bell-shaped hat on and nodded as if she were in doubt about whether to say that the seat was taken . <p> The old man sat there for a little while looking at her hands , still clutching the bag of bread . <p> " Lovely weather today  --  " <p> " Yes , wonderful  --  " she sort of sighed . He edged closer . I moved farther along the bench . But she did not move . <p> " And you are enjoying it , Madame ? " <p> She bent her head beneath the pale blue hat . Like a flower , closing up a little at evening . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one may be so bold  --  " <p> So he did n't count me at all . I felt like getting up . But Antoinette did n't . She seemed to enjoy his white handkerchief , his white hair , and the slow , almost solicitous voice . He was as neat as a folded Sunday paper . Antoinette shook her head a little and smiled . <p> " No , of course . With that smile , one is not alone , Madame . Madame has a smile that is all-encompassing . It warms  --  if one may be so bold  --  " <p> Only then did Aunt Antoinette begin to smile in earnest . The smile spread over her whole face , while the man looked almost sorrowful . And , obviously in order to comfort him , she shook the pears out of her bag . She gave me one and divided the other . <p> " That is far too much , " mumbled the gentleman , and , clearly moved , he took the half pear and a half napkin which he laid on his gray-trousered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pear rind and in the gravel with a stick , hoping fervently that Aunt Camilla would hurry back . This even though I had decided long ago that I liked Antoinette best because she always missed whatever she was trying to hit , whether it was a mosquito or a moth . And I wondered what Camilla would say about this business with the pear . But suddenly I stopped thinking , because the man stood up . Antoinette was still smiling when he put a hand on her bag , which was sitting between them . His big teeth shone in the sun . But a change had come over his smile and his whole attitude , something decisive , almost fierce , as he pushed his hand and then his whole forearm through the two handles . <p> Antoinette opened her mouth . She still looked very polite as she raised her hand a little as if to wave . There was a tickling in my neck and my stomach and all the way into my teeth . I seemed to move as if asleep , and yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away down the gravel path with his whole arm through the two handles of Antoinette ' s bag . The brown bag itself swayed against his hip . <p> All at once every sound grew loud . The gravel crackled . The birds twittered so it hurt your ears . The branches , the bench itself creaked . And Antoinette still stood there with quivering fingers . For a moment I was afraid she would run after him or faint . <p> But she merely sat down and put her hands in her pockets with a gesture that was almost merry . She had her keys in her right pocket and her wallet in the left . <p> At that moment Aunt Camilla came back . <p> " A purse snatcher , " she said , before Antoinette had even opened her mouth . " Come on , we have to go to the police station . " <p> " But it was I who cheated him , " said Antoinette almost with sympathy . <p> " Was he on a motorcycle ? " It was obvious that Camilla imagined the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringes as thick as a horse 's mane . <p> " He was n't really a robber . Just a taker . He had such nice hair and clothes . And he took good care of his teeth . " <p> " Dentures , no doubt , " said Camilla , full of distaste . " And you 've got the word idiot written all over you . " <p> " Somehow I 've always known it would happen , " said Antoinette . " And I 'd taken precautions . " <p> " You should have raised an alarm . " <p> " I really do n't think I could do that , " said Antoinette and launched into a long complicated story about how she had actually never screamed since she was fourteen and her cousin had squashed a mouse on her back . It had filled her with such loathing that she had never gone near her cousin again . And she was sure that if she so much as opened her mouth to scream , she would feel the mouse against her back again . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Camilla . <p> That was the first time they had disagreed about anything . And it did n't help matters that Antoinette described the thief as gentlemanly and cultivated . <p> I was sent home early . Mother looked confused . Her hair was tousled , and she was shuffling around in her pink bathrobe and worn-out fur slippers that had once been white . <p> She told Uncle Ole that if he did n't stop smoking , she could n't go on taking him seriously . <p> " I like you and the child , " he said heavily and gave me fifty ore . <p> But she was n't impressed . She said that being with him was sometimes just as bad as being assigned to cut up the cheese instead of sitting at the check-outcounter . <p> When he left , he slammed the door , and mother opened the windows to make a cross-breeze so the curtains flapped and my drawings fell down . Then she washed her hair with henna . <p> Next time I was looked after , we all went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bench had a special effect on Aunt Antoinette . She , who used to make way for the pigeons , headed straight for it . <p> " Not so fast . Not so fast . It 's not good for us at our age . " Aunt Camilla tried to hold her back . <p> " But I 'm feeling just fine ! " <p> Antoinette had color in her cheeks . Her lips were pink and shiny and accentuated the slight unevenness in her face , as if the left cheek were bigger than the right one . <p> On the other hand , I thought Camilla looked thinner . When she bent down to me , I noticed a dank odor on her breath . And for a moment the wind made her eyes water . <p> " Camilla , what do you think he wanted ? " <p> " Money . I 've told you that . " <p> " He did n't seem like that . " <p> " You ca n't always tell a dog by its coat . " Antoinette hit the one-legged pigeon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It flapped away to one side and glared at her indignantly . She did n't notice this either . <p> " Camilla , do you think he 'll come back ? " <p> " Over my dead body . " <p> That sentence hung in the air , and I pictured the old man with the handbag straddling Camilla 's stiff stubborn corpse . <p> The pears were unripe . The knife would n't cut them . The fruit fell down on the gravel and rolled among the birds . And the boldest started to peck at it . Not even this impressed Antoinette . <p> " Perhaps , " she mumbled , " he just wanted to reach out to someone . " <p> " Antoinette , " said Camilla . " When old houses catch fire ... " <p> " You can smell it , " smiled Antoinette with her new bonbon mouth . <p> Camilla mumbled something about a stiffness in her joints . She wanted to go home for something hot . She looked at Antoinette 's new handbag as if she 'd like to start a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were in the living room with hot chocolate in the little cups with gold inside , it was as if Antoinette expected someone to come and stir in her whipped cream for her . <p> " Drink it while it 's hot .

And do n't think I have n't noticed you 've started to paint your mouth like a fallen woman . " <p> A faint blush sprang up in Antoinette 's cheeks . She bent over her cup , pulled herself together and drank , but then immediately started to cough violently . Perhaps it was just that a skin had formed on her chocolate . But what she spat into her handkerchief looked remarkably like three limp oleander flowers . <p> " That ' s what can happen , " mumbled Camilla . She made neither an apology nor an excuse . Just smacked her lips together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter on the tea cakes or push razor blades into the filled chocolates with the greatest of ease . <p> Aunt Antoinette picked up her bag and went out . And I felt I ought to go too . For I had decided to become a fallen woman : I started to eat my open sandwiches with a knife and fork . I dug down to the moons on my nails and polished them by rubbing them on my stockings . <p> Uncle Ole stopped coming . <p> I still saw Aunt Camilla and Aunt Antoinette together . They wore housecoats and walked in step with their handbags under their arms . But after I started plucking my own eyebrows with tweezers , I was much too big to be looked after . <p> Translated by Anne Born <p> Born in 1940 , Dorrit Willumsen made her literary debut with the story collection Knagen ( The Hook ) in 1965 .
