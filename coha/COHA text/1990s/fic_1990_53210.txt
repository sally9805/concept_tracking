I AM JUST A BUSINESSMAN , not a poet . It is the poet who is supposed to see things so clearly and to remember . Perhaps it is only the poets who can die well . Not the rest of us . I drove from my home in Lake Charles , Louisiana , to the airport in Houston , Texas , to pick up my wife 's grandfather . And what is it that I experienced on that trip ? What is it that struck me as I got off the interstate highway in Beaumont , knowing the quick route to the airport as I do ? I was driving through real towns in Texas . One was named China , another Nome . One was Liberty . If I were a man who believed in symbols and omens , I would have smiled at this . I was passing through Liberty to pick up my wife 's grandfather whose own liberty my wife and I and the man 's nephew in San Francisco had finally won , after many years of trying . He was arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years under Communist rule in our home country of Vietnam . Perhaps a poet would think of those things  --  about Liberty , Texas , and my wife 's grandfather  --  and write a memorable poem . Though maybe not . I am ignorant of these matters . Maybe it is only the bird taking flight or the frog jumping into the pond that the poet is interested in . <p> All I know is that for me I drove the two-lane highway across Texas and I just noticed the businesses  --  the little ones that seemed so Vietnamese to me in the way the people always looked for some new angle , some empty corner in the marketplace . I noticed the signs for stump-grinding and for house leveling and for mud pumping , the different stands along the way  --  fireworks , fruit and vegetables , hubcaps , and antiques . The Paradise Club had a miniskirt contest , the Bait Barn had a nightcrawler special , and Texas Winners had a baseball trophy sale . There was a Donut Delight and a Future Star Twirling Academy and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swings were a mile down this dusty road . The Mattress Man said on his sign , right underneath his business name , " Jesus Is Lord . " <p> I am a Catholic and I must say that this made me smile . The Lord of the Universe , the Man of Sorrows , turned into the Lord of the Mattress , the Mattress Man . But even so , I understood what this owner was trying to do , appealing specially to those of his own kind . This is good business practice , when you know your sales area . I have done very well for myself in Lake Charles in the laundry and dry cleaning business . It is very simple . People sweat a lot in the climate of Southern Louisiana , and there was a place for a very good laundry and dry cleaner . I have two locations in Lake Charles , and I will soon open one in Sulphur . So it was this that interested me as I drove through Texas , as it always does . I am a businessman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man who believed in symbols and omens , I would have been very interested toward the end of my journey when ! came to a low highway bridge that took me across the wide converging of two rivers , for as I entered the bridge , the sign said , " Lost and Old Rivers . " These two rivers were full of little islands and submerged trees , and it was hard to see how the two ran together , for they looked more like one sprawling thing , like perhaps a large lake , something that was bound in and not moving , not flowing . Lost and old . <p> I had not given much serious thought to Mr. Chinh , my wife 's grandfather . I knew this : my wife loved him very much . We are all like that in Vietnam . We honor our families . My four children honor me very much , and I honor them . My wife is devoted to me , and I am devoted to her . I love her . We were very lucky in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , my mother and father and my wife 's mother allowed it . Her father was dead . We still have a little shrine in our house and pray for him , which is the way of all Vietnamese , even if they are Catholic . As Catholics we understand this as the communion of saints . But my wife has no clear memory of her father . He died when she was very young . He drowned swimming in the South China Sea . And after that , Mr. Chinh became like a father for my wife . <p> She wept the night before my trip to the airport . She was very happy to have her grandfather again and very sorry that she missed all those years with him . I heard her muffling the sound of her crying in the pillow , and I touched her on the shoulder and felt her shaking , and then I switched on the light by the bed . She turned her face sharply away from me , as if I would reproach her for her tears , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , " Mai , it is all right . I understand your feeling . " <p> " I know , " she said , but she did not turn back to me . So I switched the light off once more , and in the dark she came to me and I held her . <p> You must wait to understand why it is important , but at this point I must confess one thing . My wife came to me in the dark and I held her , and her crying slowed and stopped , and of course I was happy for that . I was happy to hold my wife in the dark in this moment of strong feeling for her and to be of help , but as I lay there , my mind could not focus on this woman that I love . My mind understood that she was feeling these things for a man of her own blood who had been very important to her and who then disappeared from her life for more than a decade and now was coming back into it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mind . And that was all they were to me even lying there in the dark . I made those words run in my head , but what was preoccupying me at that moment was an itching on my heel that I could not scratch and the prices of two different types of paint for the outer shop of the new dry cleaning store . My wife was a certain pressure , a warmth against me , but there was also a buzz in the electric alarm clock that I was just as conscious of . <p> Do not misjudge me . I am not a cold man . I drew my wife closer as she grew quieter , but it was a conscious decision , and even saying that , I have to work hard to remember the moment , and the memory that I have is more like a thought than a memory of my senses . And it 's not as if the itching on my heel , the buzz of the clock , are any more vivid . I have to work extremely hard to reconstruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you with assurance that there was a clock in the room or that there was a foot at the end of my leg . <p> But you will see that it is Mr. Chinh who has put me in this present state of agitation . After a time , as I held her in the bed , my wife said , " My tears are mostly happy . Do n't worry for me , Khanh . I only wish I was small enough and his back was strong enough that I could ride upon it again . " <p> At the airport gate I looked at the people filing through the door from the jetway . The faces were all white or Spanish , and they filed briskly through the door and rushed away , and then there were a long few : moments when no one appeared . I began to think that Mr. Chinh had missed the plane . I thought of the meal that my wife was preparing at home . She and my children and our best friends in Lake Charles had been working since dawn on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the door to the jetway gaped there with no one coming through , that is the only thought I had , that the food would be ruined . I did not worry about Mr. Chinh or wonder what the matter Could really be . <p> I looked over to the airline agents working behind their computers , checking in the passengers for the next flight . I was ready to seek their help when I glanced back to the door and there was Mr. Chinh . He was dressed in a red-and-black plaid sport shirt and chino pants , and he was hunched a little bit over a cane , but what surprised me was that he was not alone . A Vietnamese man about my age was holding him up on the side without the cane and bending close and talking into his ear . Then the younger man looked up and saw me , and I recognized a cousin of my wife , the son of Mr. Chinh 's nephew . He smiled at me and nodded a hello , and he jiggled the old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , and an overhead light flashed in his glasses making his eyes disappear . He too smiled , so I felt that it was all right . <p> They approached me , and I shook Mr. Chinh 's hand first . " I am so happy you have come to visit us , " I said . <p> I would have said more  --  I had a little speech in my head about my wife 's love for him , and how she is so sorry she is not at the airport , and how much his great-grandchildren want to see him . But my wife 's cousin cut in before I had a chance . " This is Mr. Khanh , " he said to the old man . " The one I told you about who would meet you . " <p> Mr. Chinh nodded and looked at me and repeated my name . He spoke no more , and I looked to the cousin , who said , " I 'm Huong , " and he bowed to me very formally . <p> " I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . He took it readily , but I knew from his formality that there could be things I did not know about Mr. Chinh . It is the custom of Vietnamese , especially of the old school of manners , not to tell you things that are unpleasant to hear . The world need not be made worse than it is by embracing the difficult things . It is assumed that you wish to hear that all is well , and many people will tell you this no matter what the situation really is . Huong struck me as being of this tradition  --  as surely his father must , too , for this is how an otherwise practical people learns an attitude such as this . <p> But I am a blunt man . Business has made me that way , particularly business in America . So I said to Mr. Huong , " Is there something wrong with Mr. Chinh ? " <p> He smiled at me as if I were a child asking about the thunder . " I came with our dear uncle to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I suddenly felt a little uncomfortable talking about the man as if he was n't there , so I looked at him . He was leaning contentedly on his cane , gazing around the circle of gates . I bent nearer to him and said , " Mr. Chinh , do you like the airport ? " <p> He turned to me at once and said , " This is a fine airport . The best I have seen . " <p> The man 's voice was strong , and this reassured me . I liked his appreciation of the airport , which I too admired , so I said to Mr. Huong , " Is he a little frail , physically ? " <p> " Yes , " said Mr. Huong , happy , I suppose , to have words put in his mouth sufficient to answer my blunt question . I did not like this cousin Huong . <p> But I was compelled to ask , " Will you be coming to Lake Charles to join us ? " <p> " No . I must decline your gracious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> I was blunt again . " You came all this way never to leave the airport ? Just to return at once ? " <p> Mr. Huong shrugged . " It is my pleasure to make sure our beloved uncle arrives safely . My father said that if you should wish to discuss Uncle Chinh 's permanent home after perhaps a week or so , he will await your call . " <p> I did n't know the details of all that , except that I was prepared for my wife 's sake and the sake of our country 's family tradition to make him part of our household . So I just nodded and took Mr. Chinh by the arm and said a brief good-bye to Mr. Huong , and the old man and I started off for the baggage check . <p> Mr. Chinh was enchanted with the airport , gawking about as we moved , and his interest was so intense and his pleasure so evident from the little clucks and nods he made that I did not try to speak with him . Twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would take the luggage , answered by our arrival at the carousel which caused him to laugh loudly when the bell rang and the silver metal track began to run . Mr. Chinh stood at the opening , and he watched each bag emerging through the plastic flaps as closely as a customs inspector . The second question was if I had a car . And when I said yes , he seemed very pleased , lifting his cane before him and tapping it down hard . " Good , " he said . " Do n't tell me what kind . I will see for myself . " <p> But in the parking garage , he was baffled . He circled the car and touched it gently with the rubber tip of his cane , touched it several places , on a taillight , a hubcap , the front bumper , the name on the grill . " I do n't know this car , " he said . " I do n't know it at all . " <p> " It 's an Acura , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just buzzed his ear . " I thought you would own a French car . A Citroen I had predicted . A 15CV sedan . " <p> " No , Mr. Chinh . It 's an Acura . It 's a very good car , " and I stopped myself from telling him it was from Japan . <p> Mr. Chinh lifted his shoulders and let them drop heavily , like he was greatly disappointed and perhaps even a little scornful . I put his bags in the trunk and opened the door for him , and we made it out of the airport and back onto the two-lane highway before any more words were spoken . I was holding my eyes on the road , trying to think of small talk , something I 'm not very good at , when Mr. Chinh finally said , " The inside is very nice . " <p> I did n't understand . ! glanced over to him , and he was running his hand along the dashboard , and I realized that he 'd been thinking about the car all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm glad you like it . " <p> " Not as nice as many others , " he said . " But nice . " <p> There 's no car interior short of a Rolls that is nicer than my Acura , but I nodded at the old man , and I told myself that there was no need to debate with him or entertain him but just to be cordial to him . Let him carry the conversation , if he wished one . But the trip looked very long ahead of me . We had n't even gotten out into the country of stump grinders and fruit stands . It was still franchised fast food and clusters of gas stations and mini-malls and car dealerships . There were many miles to go . <p> Then up ahead I saw the work of a clever man , a car dealer who had dangled a big luxury car from the top of what looked like at least a seventy-foot crane . I said to Mr. Chinh , " There 's something the Citroens do n't do , " and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . He bent down and angled his head up to look , and his mouth gaped open . He said nothing but quickly shifted to the side window as we passed the car dealership , and then he turned around to watch out the back window until the car on the crane was out of sight . <p> I expected Mr. Chinh to remark on this . Perhaps a word on how no one would ever do such a thing to a French car . There would be no need . Something like that . But he said nothing , and after a time , I decided to appreciate the silence . I just concentrated on covering these miles before the old man would be reunited with the granddaughter he loved . I found that I myself was no longer comfortable with the old ways . Like the extended family . Like other things , too . The Vietnamese indirectness , for instance . The superstition . I was a good American now , and though I wished I could do more for this old man next to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not an unpleasant thought that I had finally left Vietnam behind . <p> And I 'd left behind more than the customs . I do n't suppose that struck me as I was driving home from the airport . But it is clear to me now . I grew up , as did my wife , in Vung Tau . Both our families were pretty well off and we lived year-round in this . seaside resort on the South China Sea . The French had called it Cap St. Jacques . The sand was white and the sea was the color of jade . But I say these things not from any vivid recollection , but from a thought in my head , as real only as lines from a travel brochure . I 'd left behind me the city on the coast and the sea as well . <p> But you must understand that ultimately this does n't have anything to do with being a refugee in the United States . When I got to the two rivers again , Old and Lost , I could recognize the look of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind working . <p> Perhaps that is a bad example . What are those two rivers to me ? I mention them now only to delay speaking of the rest of my ride with Mr. Chinh . When we crossed the rivers , I suppose I was reminded of him somehow . Probably because of the earlier thoughts of the rivers as an omen . But now I tried once more to think of small talk . I saw a large curl of rubber on the shoulder of the road and then another a little later on , and I said to Mr. Chinh , " Those are retreads from trucks . In Vietnam some enterprising man would have already collected those to make some use of them . Here no one cares . " <p> The old man did not speak , but after a few moments I sensed something beside me , and I glanced and found him staring at me . " Do we have far to go ? " he asked . <p> " Perhaps an hour and a half , " I said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course , " I said . I turned off the air conditioning and , as he made faint grabbing motions at the door , I pressed the power button and lowered his window . Mr. Chinh turned his face to me with eyes slightly widened in what looked to me like alarm . " They 're power windows , " I said . " No handle . " <p> His face did not change . I thought to explain further , but before I could , he turned to the window and leaned slightly forward so that the wind rushed into his face , and his hair  --  still more black than gray  --  rose and danced , and he was just a little bit scary to me for some reason . So I concentrated again on the road , and I was happy to let him stay silent , watching the Texas highway , and this was a terrible mistake . <p> If I 'd forced him into conversation earlier , I would 've had more time to prepare for our arrival in Lake Charles . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , we were only fifteen minutes or so from home . We 'd already crossed the Sabine River into Louisiana and I 'd pointed it out to Mr. Chinh , the first words spoken in the car for an hour . Even that did n't start the conversation . Some time later the wandering of his own mind finally made him speak . He said , " ' The air ' feels good here . It 's good when you can feel it on your face as you drive . " <p> I naturally thought he was talking to me , but when I said , " Yes , that 's right , " he snapped his head around as if he 'd forgotten that I was there . <p> What could I have said to such a reaction ? I should have spoken of it to him right away . But I treated it as I would treat Mai waking from a dream and not knowing where she is . I said , " We 're less than twenty miles from Lake Charles , Mr. Chinh . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were awake now . <p> I said , " Mai ca n't wait to see you . And our children are very excited . " <p> He did not acknowledge this , which I thought was rude for the grandfather who was becoming the elder of our household . Instead , he looked out the window again , and he said , " My favorite car of all was a Hotchkiss . I had a 1934 Hotchkiss . An AM80 tourer . It was a wonderful car . I would drive it from Saigon to Hanoi . A fine car . Just like the car that won the Monte Carlo rally in 1932 . I drove many cars to Hanoi over the years . Citroen , Peugeot , Ford , DeSoto , Simca . But the Hotchkiss was the best . I would drive to Hanoi at the end of the year and spend ten days and return . It was eighteen hundred kilometers . I drove it in two days . I 'd drive in the day , and my driver would drive at night . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and the moon was shining , and we drove along the beach . Then we 'd stop and turn the lights on , and rabbits would come out , and we 'd catch them . Very simple . I can see their eyes shining in the lights . Then we 'd make a fire on the beach . The sparks would fly up , and we 'd sit and eat and listen to the sea . It was very nice , driving . Very nice . " <p> Mr. Chinh stopped speaking . He kept his face to the wind , and I was conscious of the hum of my Acura 's engine , and I felt very strange . This man beside me was rushing along the South China Sea . Right now . He had felt something so strong that he could summon it up and place himself within it , and the moment would not fade , the eyes of the rabbits still shone , and the sparks still climbed into the sky , and he was a happy man . <p> Then we were passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose on the 1-10 bridge , and Lake Charles was before us , and I said to Mr. Chinh , " We are almost home now . " <p> And the old man turned to me and said , " Where is it that we are going ? " <p> " Where ? " <p> " You 're the friend of my nephew ? " <p> " I 'm the husband of Mai , your granddaughter , " I said , and I tried to tell myself he was still caught on some beach on the way to Hanoi . <p> " Granddaughter ? " he said . <p> " Mai . The daughter of your daughter Diem . " I was trying to hold off the feeling in my chest that moved like the old man 's hair was moving in the wind . <p> Mr. Chinh slowly cocked his head , and he narrowed his eyes , and he thought for a long moment and said , " Diem lost her husband in the sea . " <p> " Yes , " I said , and I drew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " She had no daughter . " <p> " What do you mean ? Of course she had a daughter . " <p> " I think she was childless . " <p> " She had a daughter and a son . " I found that I was shouting . Perhaps I should have pulled off to the side of the road at that moment . I should have pulled off and tried to get through to Mr. Chinh . But it would have been futile , and then I would still have been forced to take him to my wife . I could n't very well just walk him into the lake and drive away . As it was , I had five more minutes as I drove to our house , and I spent every second trying carefully to explain who Mai was . But Mr. Chinh could not remember . Worse than that . He was certain I was wrong . <p> I stopped at the final stop sign before our house , and I tried once more . " Mai is the daughter of Nho and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you said . Then you were like a father to Mai You carried her on your back . " <p> " My daughter Diem had no children . She lived in Nha Trang . " <p> " Not in Nha Trang . She never lived in Nha Trang . " <p> Mr. Chinh shook his head no , refuting me with the gentleness of absolute conviction . " She lived on the beach of Nha Trang , a very beautiful beach . And she had no children . She was just a little girl herself . How could she have children ? " <p> I felt weak now . I could barely speak the words , but I said , " She had a daughter . My wife . You love her . " <p> The old man finally just turned his face away from me . He sat with his head in the window as if he were patiently waiting for the wind to start up again . <p> I felt very bad for my wife . But it was n't that simple . I 've become a blunt man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I do business . So I will say this bluntly . I felt bad for Mai , but I was even more concerned for myself . The old man frightened me . And it was n't in the way you might think , with my saying to myself , Oh that could be me over there sitting with my head out the window and forgetting who my closest relatives are . It was different The long house with the steep roof and the massively gnarled live oak in the front yard . My family heard my car as I turned onto the side street and then into our driveway . They came to the side door and poured out , and I got out of the car quickly , intercepting the children . I told my oldest son to take the others into the house and wait , to give their mother some time alone with her grandfather whom she had n't seen in so many years . I have good children , obedient children , and they disappeared again even as I heard my wife opening the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the old man was standing beside the car . My wife embraced him , and his head was perched on her shoulder , and there was nothing on his face at all , no feeling except perhaps the faint-est wrinkling of puzzlement . Perhaps I should have stayed at my wife 's side as the old man went on to explain to her that she did n't exist . But I could not . I wished to walk briskly away , far from this house , far from the old man and his granddaughter . I wished to walk as fast as I could , to run . But at least I fought that desire . I simply turned away and moved off , along the side of the house to the front yard . <p> I stopped near the live oak and looked about , trying to see things . Trying to see this tree , for instance . This tree as black as a charcoal cricket and with great lower limbs , as massive themselves as the main trunks of most other trees , shooting straight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A monstrous tree . I leaned against it , and as I looked away , the tree faded within me . It was gone , and I envied the old man , I knew . I envied him driving his Hotchkiss along the beach half a century ago . Envied him his sparks flying into the air . But my very envy frightened me . Look at the man , I thought . He remembered his car , but he ca n't remember his granddaughter . <p> And I demanded of myself : Could I ? Even as I stood there ? Could I remember this woman whom I loved ? I 'd seen her just moments ago . I 'd lived with her for more than twenty years . And certainly if she was standing there beside me , if she spoke , she would have been intensely familiar . But separated from her , I could not picture her clearly . I could construct her face accurately in my mind . But the image did not burn there , did not rush upon me and fill me up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not put my face into the wind and see her eyes as clearly as Mr. Chinh saw the eyes of the rabbits in his headlights . <p> Not the eyes of my wife and not my country either . I 'd lost a whole country , and I did n't give it a thought . Vung Tau was a beautiful city , and if I put my face into the wind I could see nothing of it clearly , not its shaded streets or its white sand beaches , not the South China Sea lying there beside it . I can speak these words , and perhaps you can see these things clearly because you are using your imagination . But I can not imagine these things because I lived them , and to remember them with the vividness I know they should have is impossible . They are lost to me . <p> Until perhaps when I am as old as Mr. Chinh . Perhaps he , too , moved through his life as distracted as me . Perhaps only after he forgot his granddaughter did he remember his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to forget the one to remember the other . Not that I think he 'd made that conscious choice . Something deep inside him was sorting out his life as it was about to end . And that is what frightens me the most . I am afraid that deep down I am built on a much smaller scale than the surface of my mind aspires to . When something finally comes back to me with real force , perhaps it will be a luxury car hanging on a crane or the freshly painted wall of a new dry cleaning store or the faint buzz of the alarm clock beside my bed . Deep down , secretly , I may be prepared to betray all that I think I love the most . <p> This is what brought me to the slump of grief against the live oak in my front yard . I leaned there , and the time passed , and then my wife crept up beside me . I turned to her , and she was crying quietly , her head bowed and her hand covering her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> " I put him in the guest room , " she said . " He thanked me as he would an innkeeper . " She sobbed faintly , and I wanted to touch her , but my arm was very heavy , as if I was standing at the bottom of the sea . It rose only a few inches from my side . Then she said , " I thought he might remember after he slept . " <p> I could neither reassure her with a lie nor make her face the truth . But I had to do something . I had thought too much about this already . A good businessman knows when to stop thinking and to act instead . I drew close to my wife , but only briefly did my arm rise and hold her . That was the same as all the other forgotten gestures of my life . Suddenly I surprised myself and my wife , too . I stepped in front of her and crouched down , and before either of us could think to feel foolish , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I began to move about the yard , walking at first , down the long drooping lower branch of the oak tree and then faster along the sidewalk and then up the other side of the house , and I was going faster , and she only protested for a moment before she was laughing and holding on tighter , clinging with her legs about my waist and her arms around my neck , and I ran with her , ran as fast as I could so that she laughed harder , and I felt her clinging against me , pressing against me , and I felt her breath on the side of my face as warm and moist as a breeze off the South China Sea . <p> <p> By ROBERT OLEN BUTLER <p>
