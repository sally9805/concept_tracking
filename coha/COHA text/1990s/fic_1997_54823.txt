preSome say that ever ' gainst that season comesWherein our Saviour 's birth is celebrated , This bird of dawning singeth all night longAnd then , they say , no spirit dare stir abroad ; The nights are wholesome ; then no planets strike , No fairy takes , nor witch hath power to charm , So hallow 'd and so gracious is that time .  --  Hamlet I.i . You sure you really want to hear about all this ? I mean , me and Bully were n't really the main ones . <p> Okay . Is that thing on ? <p> Hi . My name 's Donnie , and I 'm a donkey . My friend 's name is Bully , only he 's not really a bull , you know what I mean ? They cut off his  --  you know . So he would n't get mad . That 's something lots of people do n't understand , they think he ca n't . He can , only he hardly ever does . But if he does , watch out , because he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm strong anyhow . You 'd be surprised how much I can carry or how hard I can kick , and I can run a lot faster than you think , too . <p> As well as I can figure , we were born on Earth , only they did n't call it that back there , they called it Texas . There was a big school that had farms and ranches all over for trying out new seeds and new ways of growing silage and all that . And before we were ever born they did stuff to us to make us as smart as most people , and worked on our tongues and mouths some , too . Not enough to make us sound like you  --  we know we do n't  --  but enough so you could understand us . <p> The idea was that there 's still a lot of places like this one , where people are poor and use animals where rich people 'd use machines . Like carrying firewood . If they 're rich enough to have a donkey , they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pull a cart that 's too big for me . They do all that here , probably you 've seen it . And they thought if we could talk to those people and understand what they told us , it might be better . <p> I guess it did n't work out too good though , because after a few years they dropped the whole thing and sold us off . I really did n't know Bully up till then . I guess I 'd seen him , but there were a lot around , cows mostly . If I did , I did n't pay attention . Maybe you 've talked to him already ? <p> He 's mostly red and white , because there 's Hereford in him , and black because of other stuff . His hump 's from Santa Gertrudis , which is what his more was , so there 's Indian cattle and longhorns back there . I 'm little , and gray like you see except for this mark on my back . <p> The way we got together was , the same man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clown . He taught us a lot of stuff we 'd never known about back on the ranch , like various acts and Bully to let people ride on his back . We went to so many foreign worlds with Mango that I lost count after a while . I can count up to ten , usually . It was more than that , so I started counting tens . I know you 'd do it different , but that was the only thing I could think of that would work for me , or Bully either . But after a while I sort of forgot , because what difference did it make ? Besides , sometimes we went back to one where we 'd been before if the tip had been good . <p> We 're clowns too , and we 're pretty famous now . I guess you 've seen us . <p> We 'd get painted up and put on ruffs . That 's what you call the big collars , they 're ruffs . Mango 'd beat his drum to get us a crowd , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Like , Mango would be trying to lead me , only Bully would be lying down and Mango not see him , and he 'd back into one of Bully 's horns and jump , and Bully 'd beller . We did n't any of us talk when we did our acts , and that sure was a swell idea of Mango 's , I mean nobody talking , because it would 've got us killed here on Sidhe . Quick , too . There 's witches here , and the Beautiful Ones do n't like them one little bit . <p> Then Mango 'd put his finger up to his head and have an idea , and wink at everybody . He 'd tie me to Bully so Bully 'd pull me along , and that way I 'd have to go . He 'd do it , and Bully would n't get up . Mango 'd kick him and poke him and holler at him , but Buily 'd just yawn . Finally Mango 'd back off and talk to both of us , only without talking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and face and hands , and his whole body . He 'd show how he got us when we were little , and what good care he 'd taken of us  --  we 'd shake our heads at that  --  how he 'd fed us and nursed us when we were sick . Then he 'd say how all that was over now . He was going to sell us to the butcher  --  pointing to a butcher 's shop , if there was one on that street  --  and the butcher 'd cut our throats and skin us , and chop us up to sell . He 'd say that I was pork , Mango 'd say , and he 'd say Bully was donkey meat . <p> That 'd get Bully mad . He 'd jump up and paw the ground and snort , and then he 'd chase Mango around and around in a big circle , with me still tied to him standing in the middle and turning around to watch them . Pretty soon he 'd get tired and Mango 'd get tired , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Bully 'd lie down where he 'd been lying down before , with Mango panting and mopping up sweat . <p> That 's when I 'd come up behind him and stand on my hind legs , and tap him on the shoulder with one of my front hoofs  --  that usually got the biggest laugh in the whole act . He 'd turn around the wrong way , and I 'd be down again . I 'd try to get him to get on my back , pulling on his clown coat with my teeth and pushing him with my head , and making regular donkey noises , but he never would get the idea . After a lot of that  --  as long as it was getting good laughs  --  I 'd get him to standing straddle-legged and then run between his legs and sort of scoop him up . Mango was one of those tall , skinny birds , and he 'd have to pull his legs way up to keep his feet from dragging . Then I 'd climb up on Bully 's back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go ' round in a circle , me on Bully and Mango on me . And after that we 'd pass the hat . <p> That was just one act , you understand . We had a lot of others , and if the money was good in a certain part of town , we 'd go back there again next day and put on a different act . When we 'd played out a city , we 'd go on to another one , and when we 'd played all the cities or Mango could find a way to get to some other world cheap , away we 'd go . There were places where we could 've stayed on and on , if you ask me , just going around five or six towns . But that was n't Mango . If he 'd wanted to live like that , he 'd never have become a clown at all , he said . He told me once he wanted to see new smiles , and maybe that was it . <p> We 'd loop back sometimes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out toward the rim and farther every year . He 'd meet somebody , some sailor usually , and he 'd talk about someplace he 'd just been to , what a hellhole it was . And after that , Mango 'd always be itching to go there . He 'd talk about it and me and Bully 'd say it sounded pretty bad , all the killing and storms , bad air , nothing but trouble . And Mango 'd say think how much they 'd love us there , how they need somebody like us . When Mango looked in a mirror , I do n't think he saw what other people saw , but something a whole lot bigger and nicer . And the longer he 's gone , the more I get to thinking he was right , that was what was there , and not the long skinny bird with the long skinny face that I always saw when I looked at him . Now I like to think he 's gone someplace better , that he 's played out this universe and caught a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass and clean water all over . Only Mango 'd go down below , if he could . He 'd think about how bad it was and how they needed us , and he 'd say it was just for a couple weeks and go . <p> That 's how it was going to be when we came here . Just a couple weeks . We 've been here close to ten years , I think , me and Bully have now . <p> There are n't a lot of worlds with their own intelligent native races , I guess everybody knows that . And the ones that have them , that world 's theirs , and generally they wo n't let humans settle on it at all . Sidhe 's different , because the intelligent race here is the Beautiful Ones and there 's nothing else in the galaxy like them . That 's what I hear , and it 's probably a real good thing too . The Beautiful Ones will let people come , only they ca n't have children here . Probably you 've heard about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change genes and make something better . You take Bully and me . It was one of the smartest women on Earth that did us , and all the others there that could have done it too could 've sat down in her living room . The Beautiful Ones do n't have any science and do n't want it , but they 've got that built in , just like Bully 's got all his stomachs . Whenever one 's fixing to have a child , that child 's going to look a lot like she wanted it to . She does n't have to do anything but want , and the more she wants it the closer she gets . <p> So when the first humans got here , and they had ships and crawlers and all that , the Beautiful Ones thought that stuff was really swell , and every generation got to looking more and more like people until pretty soon it was like it is now , and the Beautiful Ones look a whole lot better than real people do , taller than Mango , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurts to look at them , especially when you know they 're not people at all . You 've seen some , right ? <p> Well , maybe I do , but I ca n't say it very good . I have n't got all the words . They move around like they 're dancing all the time . And as soon as you see one , you know she 's the best dancer in the whole universe . Or he is . Their hair 's like the gold stuff you see in a jewelry store , and their skin 's the color of bread baking , just starting to get brown . Their teeth are just so , and their eyes are all kinds of funny colors , and change while you 're looking at them . That 's what Mango said . I ca n't see most colors very good , but he knew a lot about them . I ca n't dance , either , not a lick , but I sing a little . Is that enough about the Beautiful Ones ? <p> Okay . They wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most wo n't , because word 's gotten around . You were pretty brave to come , is what I think . <p> Well , I sure hope they do n't . They 're not very good at keeping promises . I do n't think it 's forgetting or even badness as much as it 's just that the promising idea does n't make much sense to them . They do n't really understand it . If I were you I 'd get out quick and not tell anybody I was going till I 'd gone . <p> People still come , though , mostly the ones that are too poor to go anyplace else . You know how it is . If a world thinks you 're probably going to need a lot of help , they wo n't let you come . Not even just to stop over . But Sidhe will take all those , and the more kids they 've got before they get here the better , so they 'll grow up right here . Because on Sidhe nobody 's going to look out for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We did n't have any relatives here , and we were n't living next door to anybody , really . We were going all around the way we always did , so there was just us . People kept telling us the Beautiful Ones would n't ever let us leave , so pretty soon Mango wanted to go and we came here and asked around at the spaceport . That 's when we found out the people had been right . The Beautiful Ones were n't letting anybody go off world unless there was somebody that had gotten away already that was asking about them , and nobody was asking about us . The sailors were afraid to get off their ships , even , because they figured the Beautiful Ones would n't let them back on . Some Beautiful Ones would go out to the port at night , or when it was dark weather or raining , and dance for them , dance around the ship , mostly , or make a figure-of-eight around two ships , when there was two ships , and sometimes a sailor would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook up with him , depending on what he wanted , and show him how to dance . Or her , if the sailor was a woman , and they 'd all dance some more . And finally they 'd go off together , with the sailor grinning and waving to his friends on the ship . That sailor 'd hardly ever come back , though . <p> We tried and tried , Mango talking to various ones , only nothing ever came of it . There were days  --  I remember two  --  when we went out to the port , Mango thinking we were going to get on a ship sure , only we never quite would . Then one day he said he thought he had a way to do it , but it would only work for him , not for us , so he was going to take it , and when he got offworld he 'd start in on anybody from Earth that he could find , viewing the ambassador , and letters , and all that , and get us off too . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really get off himself and neither did Bully . <p> This is something I 'd rather I did n't have to tell about , but I guess I do . The way Mango 'd found , or thought he had , was to hide in a cargo canister . <p> The one he picked was full of furs , and the captain wanted it fumigated before he 'd take it on board for fear there was fleas in them or something . So they opened it up and sprayed stuff in and Mango coughed , and that was how they found him . <p> And they killed him . There was two Beautiful Ones there to see nobody got away on that ship , is what we heard , and they chopped him up with their swords . <p> No , they ca n't make swords or much of anything . But they make people make the things for them , swords and lots of other stuff . That 's why they want people here , to make stuff for them and make stuff to trade . Like those furs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Beautiful Ones were going to trade them offworld and buy stuff they wanted , flitters and blasters and ships of their own . So they want a ton of people to do that . <p> Sure they want kids . There 's Beautiful Ones on the other worlds around here now to get more people to come , and if it 's a big family they 'll pay passage . But they do n't want any kids born here , because they 're scared of them . They 're afraid that what their mothers will want is somebody that can beat up the Beautiful Ones . The mothers would want it , too , I guess , only wanting does n't work for people . . . . <p> All right , if you 'd really like to hear . I do n't know anything about anything except clowning , I know that , and maybe it 's just being here too long . But sometimes I wonder if the Beautiful Ones are n't right and the people wrong . Maybe people do get what they want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bully do . Because everybody here kept talking about it . How if ever it happened and the Beautiful Ones did n't kill it , that 'd be one that 'd put people on top and the Beautiful Ones on the bottom , or anyhow make them treat people better . That kid would be , when he grew up . <p> Oh , sure . It happens . It happens a lot . Some woman and her husband get careless , or maybe just a boy and a girl . But the Beautiful Ones always hear . And pretty soon after the baby comes , they come too . What happened this time  --  <p> Right . I 'm starting off before I 'm hitched up , I guess . <p> With Mango gone , Bully and me figured to go on clowning by ourselves . We worked up a couple of acts for just the two of us , and we could pass the hat like we had before , holding it in our teeth . Only the first time we did it I could see it was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't paint our faces the way Mango had , and without paint it did n't feel right . Another one was somebody was always grabbing us and saying we belonged to him . We had to hurt a couple of those birds pretty bad , and we did n't like that . <p> So pretty soon even Bully could see we needed somebody , and we found this boy , Ezry , that had n't ever had a father and his mother was gone . We pay him to own us , only he has to do what we say . There 's been some bad times besides the good ones , but it 's worked out pretty well . We 're satisfied , and so 's he . He paints our faces and buttons our ruffs , and beats Mango 's drum to get us a crowd just like Mango used to . Did you catch our act ? <p> It 's really pretty simple . I 'm carrying a basket of corn on each side of me , and I come out and try to eat it myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . Then I try it the other way , going faster and faster , and get out of breath and walk around funny like I 'm dizzy , and finally I fall down . It gets a big laugh . <p> Then Bully comes out , and he 's got a basket on each side too , only his are bigger and full of hay . He reaches around as far as he can and gets a few straws , then he reaches around the other way and gets a few more . He 's got this thing where he tries to hook a basket with his horn , and he almost gets it . Maybe he does get it a little , but then it slips off . Then he starts trying to untie the rope around his belly with his back hoofs , first the left one , then the right . Finally he puts his head down and looks between his front legs at his back ones , left then right . And he tries to use them both at the same time , and naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching my mouth straight over my back , and that does n't work either . <p> Then Ezry comes out and whispers in our ears , and after that I eat hay out of Bully 's baskets and he eats corn out of mine , and then we pass the hat . <p> That act gets some good laughs and brings in the cash , but there 's more to it . See , we 're saying to everybody that we 've got to pull together and look out for each other , and that goes right along with this family you want to know about . <p> They were just country people from some village up-river . He lumbered up there , he said , and had a little sawmill and so on . Well , she was about to have the kid , and where they lived there was n't anybody to help her , and you know somebody 's going to tell the Beautiful Ones next time some come through . It 's bound to happen . So they 'd come down here trying to get a ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what happened to Mango . Then she goes into labor . <p> It was Ezry that found out about them when the place where they 'd been staying would n't let them back in , and I guess if he 'd told her husband about Bully and me maybe they would n't have come at all . But maybe they would , because they did n't have any time to fool around . We bedded her down on clean hay that Bully forked out of our loft , and it could 've been worse . People found out , naturally . You ca n't hide a thing like that very long here in the city where people are poor and got to live so close together . So they came and stood around and gawked , because most of them had n't ever seen a real newborn for years and years , and some that came here as kids never had . <p> We got witches here . I guess you 've heard . A lot of the worlds I 've been on , they do n't think there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me it 's because somebody has to store up all the stuff people know . On most worlds it 's computers and maybe teachers , and some in books . But on a world like Sidhe , well , they got a little school started here . It 's the first one on Sidhe . <p> Anyway , this witch comes and tells everybody that this new kid the woman had , he 's going to be the one . When he gets big he 's going to kick the Beautiful Ones ' teeth out and black their eyes , and after that people here are going to get a better shake . They 'll be able to have kids of their own if they want them , and have a say in the way their taxes get spent and all that . <p> Then somebody laughed , a little skinny bird it was that 'd worked his way to the front . This witch starts screeching at him , and he starts hollering back at her , so Bully shuts him up . Bully 's got this big deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , and if the little bird do n't believe it , he 'll put a horn right through him , and anybody that runs off and tells Beautiful Ones about the new kid is in for a dose of the same . <p> Well , Bully 's the best friend I 've got , right ? So I chime in . My voice is n't deep like his , but I can be pretty loud when I want to . The little bird shuts up and sort of stares at us , and after a minute I see they all are . Then he says , like he ca n't hardly get it out , he thought we did n't talk . So I say tonight we do , and Bully chimes in for me and says only tonight , but they better not talk themselves if they know what he means . So that 's how we got to be sort of famous . <p> Right there 's where we got lucky , too , because it 's when the sheepherders came . There 's a couple horses right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess somebody 'd come in and got a horse , and when he got out into the country he told everybody . Anyway there was eight or ten sheepherders , and there 's some real bad animals here on Sidhe , so if you 're going to keep sheep you 'd better be a real tough bird with some real tough dogs . They all had those big sticks , too , and when they talked folks listened . <p> So it was quiet , pretty quiet anyhow , for a week or so , and the Beautiful Ones never did catch on . Then three teachers from the new school came by  --  I guess three was all they had back then . They 'd been passing the hat for this country family , and they 'd gotten up quite a nice chunk of change . <p> Oh , sure , me and Bully put in some too , for Mango . <p> And with that much they were able to get a ship , just like they 'd wanted when they came here . Folks say they went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I guess nobody really knows , or somebody heard somebody else wrong , you know how that is . But I know they really did get on a ship , because I took her and her new kid out to the port and watched her and her husband climb in it , him carrying the kid . Then I watched  --  we all did , that 's Bully and me and Ezry  --  till it took off . I do n't know if she waved or anything , except for when she was about to go in , because I could n't see for sure . Ezry says she did , and he 's got real good eyes . But I was the one she sat on , her nursing her new kid , all the way out there . Every time Bully reminds me he was the first one to talk to the people the night the new kid was born , I remind him about that . <p> Really ? You think they 're back here ? You do n't say ! Out in the boondocks somewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know anything about it . I never heard a thing about them coming back till you said so , and probably I 'll forget , too , as soon as you 're out of here . <p> You ever think about how the Beautiful Ones are going to stick your feet in the fire if they hear you know something like that ? You better know exactly where they are , and no mistakes , and who 's hiding them and the rest of it . Because they 're going to keep on doing this and that till you tell them all that stuff . You ever see them when they throw them into the street after a little conversation like that ? Fingernails torn off , and they ca n't stand up or anything . They holier for their friends and relatives , but their friends and relatives know there 's Beautiful Ones watching to see who tries to help . Pretty soon the street dogs come . The ones that got thrown out can generally keep them off at first , but when there gets to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yeah , I figured you did n't really know anything about her and her husband and the kid coming back . I figured you were just blowing off , because I do it too , sometimes  --  smartass is what Bully says . You have a real nice trip back to Earth , and when you get there you tell them I really do n't know much of anything about whatever might be going on out here . <p> How could I ? I 'm just a donkey . <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> <p> By Gene Wolfe <p> Tor Books just released Gene Wolfe 's new novel , Exodus from the Long Sun , the final volume in The Book of the Long Sun .
