TITLE : THE SEVEN FAT YEARS <P> AUTHOR : ROBERT L. BARTLEY <P> PUBLISHER : FREE PRESS ; 347 PAGES ; $22.95 <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : A paean to Reaganomics that glosses over the excesses and inequities of the Reagan era . <P> IF THE 1980S WERE THE WORST OF times for critics of that debt-propelled decade , they were the best of times for Wall Street Journal editor Robert Bartley . From his pulpit at the head of the Journal 's editorial page , Bartley preached the gospel of tax cuts and deregulation that became known as Reaganomics and hurled anathemas at heretics who argued that the government had a positive role to play in the U.S. economy . While Bartley 's polemics sometimes clashed with facts reported in the Journal 's news columns , which were full of tales of greed and corruption in the executive suite , they provided comfort to many of the paper 's conservative readers . <P> In The Seven Fat Years , Bartley calls for a return to the policies that , he says , made the ' 80s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the book tells how Bartley and such fellow supply- siders as economist Arthur Laffer and journalist Jude Wanniski cooked up the recipe for Reaganomics over meals at a Wall Street watering hole called Michael 1 . The basic ingredients were tax cuts and a monetary policy capable of producing low and stable interest rates . " As 1982 drew to a merciful close , " Bartley writes , " both sides of the Michael 1 prescription were finally coming into place . The Seven Fat Years began in November . " <P> What those wondrous years wrought , as Bartley tells it , was the unprecedented creation of 18 million new jobs and a rekindling of the American spirit . The decade saw unfettered entrepreneurs create a revolution in communication that turned personal computers , fax machines and cable TV into home and office staples . At the same time , venture capital boomed and new stock and bond offerings blossomed . Bartley even applauds changes that took place in America 's eating habits . " Frozen yogurt became a diet staple , " he enthuses , " with estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem with this panegyric is all the lumpy and inconvenient facts , such as the crumbling U.S. infrastructure and the declining competitiveness of American corporations , that Bartley tries to dismiss . Did the budget deficit swell menacingly in the ' 80s , for example ? No problem ! Japan and Germany had lots of red ink too , and " advanced " economists doubt that deficits even matter . Did the plight of the poor worsen ? Not really , Bartley argues . The data for low-income households overstate the extent of poverty by counting many retired people  --  who often own their own homes and have plenty of capital  --  along with college students who get aid from their parents . <P> Yet Bartley applies no such reductive reasoning to the numbers that buttress his arguments . He takes the explosion of new jobs at face value , for example , without pointing out that many paid so little that only the growth of two- income households kept the average family 's inflation-adjusted earnings from falling behind .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
