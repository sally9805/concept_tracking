<p> Reading bad history book <p> The historical misinformation in Joe Olvera 's May 3 Outlook article on Cinco de Mayo went well beyond mistaking Napoleon III for Napoleon Bonaparte ( Viewpoints , May 7 " Olvera 's rewriting history " ) . His version of Mexican history is about as authentic as Taco Bell 's version of gorditas . <p> Olvera stated that Juarez was the first constitutional president of Mexico , which is a half-truth . Juarez was the first president under the 1857 Constitution , but there was an earlier constitution , challenges . <p> Olvera also stated that Maximilian " set up camp in the Azteca nation . " Sorry , but Mexico had n't been an Aztec nation since 1521 , which any fifth-grader armed with even a bad history textbook could have told him . That such blatant inaccuracies make it to the pages of a premier American newspaper is really depressing . <p> Olvera 's goal , to give American readers an appreciation for the heritage of our closest neighbors by comparing the great heroes , Abraham Lincoln and Juarez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grasp of historical knowledge almost entirely defeated his purpose and the article 's appearance in the Chronicle diminishes the stature of an otherwise fine editorial page . <p> Sean Cavazos-Kottke , Houston <p> A simple solution to area codes <p> I have a simple solution to the Texas Public Utility Commission 's ill-conceived plan to implement a third overlay area code for the Houston area . I believe that 75 to 90 percent of new phone numbers for Houston are due to cellular phones , pagers and fax machines . Unless we do something to address the growth explosion of these new telecommunications devices , we will be putting a Band Aid on the problem . <p> The last " solution , " implemented in June 1997 , has not even lasted 10 months . How long will this new one last ? <p> We should have both " geographical area codes " and " mobile/overlay codes . " The geographical area codes of 713 and 281 would remain intact and be reserved exclusively for non-mobile customers ( residential , business numbers and fax machines ) . <p> A new mobile/overlay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used exclusively for mobile services . Existing 713 and 281 cellular phone and/or pager numbers would be required to eventually change to the new mobile/overlay code . <p> This would provide Houston with an ample supply of new phone numbers in the geographical area codes for many years to come . <p> As cellular phones and pagers become even more popular , we can easily add more mobile/overlay codes to accommodate them without disrupting the entire telephone system every few months . <p> Could you imagine the uproar if the U.S. post office suddenly started adding " overlay ZIP codes " all across the country because we were somehow running out of new street addresses ? The PUC 's latest plan makes no more sense . <p> Brandon Engler , Houston <p> Pay attention to the facts <p> A May 6 Viewpoints letter from Donn Taylor ( " Under the rule of law or men ? " ) was an outrageous defense of independent counsel Kenneth Starr 's prosecution of the president . Taylor charged the previous Viewpoints letters attacking Starr had not mentioned a single fact to substantiate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps they were not recognized . <p> This all-powerful prosecutor has spent $ 40 million and four years and has not delivered an indictment against the man he was hired to investigate . He has used the power of subpoena to interrogate reporters who have written negative comments about him . He is trying to subpoena purchased book lists of a private citizen . <p> Grand jury proceedings have been selectively leaked to the press from his office . He tried to secretly tape the president before he asked the Justice Department for permission . <p> Please stop misrepresenting the criticism of Starr . This is a political vendetta by a completely out-of-control investigator and an awful episode in American jurisprudence . A partisan prosecutor is trampling on the presidency and our justice system . <p> Benjamin Gordon , Cypress <p> Some good sources of evil <p> The assertion in the May 6 Mallard Fillmore comic strip that guns are " inanimate objects , neither good nor bad in and of themselves " is one of the gun lobby 's frequent arguments and sounds good . But if you think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contaminated hypodermic needle or a crack pipe ? These , too , are inanimate objects . Would we say these things are neither good nor bad ? Of course not . <p> Such inanimate objects are sources of evil in our society . We know it and that 's why we seek to control them . We should do the same with guns . <p> Ron Siemers , Bellaire <p> Greed slaps workers ' faces <p> So Mercedes-Benz wants to buy Chrysler . Why would n't they ? They will gain access to the hottest car company going right now . A company with next-century technology developed after we taxpayers saved them from extinction . Taxpayers kept them alive by spending millions of our tax dollars to buy Chrysler vehicles for use by the U.S. government . <p> The Chrysler stockholders will get a substantial one-time profit , but the Chrysler workers will get the shaft . <p> This move would not be good for our economy , will not lead to anything but the shrinking of our domestic automotive production and will be a slap in the face to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were saving American jobs . Greed conquers all : It will be the death of this country . <p> August Galiano , Houston <p> Too hot for a marathon <p> These hot and humid days , and the many surely on the way , have me a little worried about the success of an Olympic Summer Games in Houston . I do n't know how any such event would be feasible unless every activity were held indoors . <p> There is a reason the Houston Marathon is held in January not in July . Any such event in Houston 's heat and humidity could be a potential disaster . <p> Perhaps those behind Houston 's efforts have been lulled into a false sense of security by Houston 's relatively nice weather in the other three seasons of the year . But for the Summer Olympic Games in the United States : Leave it to a more temperate climate . <p> Nicholas Bailey , Houston <p> Yarbrough should resign <p> It is unconscionable for an elected official , who has taken an oath to uphold the law , could be so derelict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His blatant disregard for the law as shown by his unwillingness to pay federal taxes for three years , is only overshadowed by the sad fact it took so long for him to come clean . <p> He has dishonored himself , his family and his constituents through his negligence . He should step down immediately and allow a more trustworthy individual to represent the good citizens of his district . <p> Christopher B. Telschow , Kingwood <p> Hospital district milk cow <p> I hope the $ 29 million slashes in the budget the Harris County Hospital District says it needs will drive home the devastating effects this will have on lives saved , quality of care and emergency room care . That figure is just about the same as the yearly amount Commissioners Court has been siphoning off from the Hospital District . They 've been using the Hospital District as a milk cow , giving themselves salary raises and disregarding our premier medical teaching colleges , doctors , nursing staff and the poor they are serving . <p> Barbara Barrett , Houston
