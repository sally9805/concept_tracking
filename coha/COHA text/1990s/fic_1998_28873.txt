Neverwhere A Novel Chapter One She had been running for days now , a harum-scarum tumbling flight through passages and tunnels . She was hungry , and exhausted , and more tired than a body could stand , and each successive door was proving harder to open . After four days of flight , she had found a hiding place , a tiny stone burrow , under the world , where she would be safe , or so she prayed , and at last she slept . Mr. Croup had hired Ross at the last Floating Market , which had been held in Westminster Abbey . " Think of him , " he told Mr. Vandemar , " as a canary . " " Sings ? " asked Mr. Vandemar . " I doubt it ; I sincerely and utterly doubt it . " Mr. Croup ran a hand through his lank orange hair . " No , my fine friend , I was thinking metaphoncally  --  more along the lines of the birds they take down mines . " Mr. Vandemar nodded , comprehension dawning slowly : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemblance to a canary . He was huge-almost as big as Mr. Vandemar  --  and extremely grubby , and quite hairless , and he said very little , although he had made a point of telling each of them that he liked to kill things , and he was good at it ; and this amused Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar . But he was a canary , and he never knew it . So Mr. Ross went first , in his filthy T-shirt and his crusted blue-jeans , and Croup and Vandemar walked behind him , in their elegant black suits . There are four simple ways for the observant to tell Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar apart : first , Mr. Vandemar is two and a half heads taller than Mr. Croup ; second , Mr. Croup has eyes of a faded china blue , while Mr. Vandemar 's eyes are brown ; third , while Mr. Vandemar fashioned the rings he wears on his right hand out of the skulls of four ravens , Mr. Croup has no obvious jewelery ; fourth , Mr. Croup likes words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look nothing at all alike . A rustle in the tunnel darkness ; Mr. Vandemar 's knife was in his hand , and then it was no longer in his hand , and it was quivering gently almost thirty feet away . He walked over to his knife and picked it up by the hilt . There was a gray rat impaled on the blade , its mouth opening and closing impotently as the life fled . He crushed its skull between finger and thumb . " Now , there 's one rat that wo n't be telling any more tales , " said Mr. Croup . He chuckled at his own joke . Mr. Vandemar did not respond . " Rat . Tales . Get it ? " Mr. Vandemar pulled the rat from the blade and began to munch on it , thoughtfully , head first . Mr. Croup slapped it out of his hands . " Stop that , " he said . Mr. Vandemar put his knife away , a little sullenly . " Buck up , " hissed Mr. Croup , encouragingly . " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . People to damage . " Three years in London had not changed Richard , although it had changed the way he perceived the city . Richard had originally imagined London as a gray city , even a black city , from pictures he had seen , and he was surprised to find it filled with color . It was a city of red brick and white stone , red buses and large black taxis , bright red mailboxes and green grassy parks and cemeteries . It was a city in which the very old and the awkwardly new jostled each other , not uncomfortably , but without respect ; a city of shops and offices and restaurants and homes , of parks and churches , of ignored monuments and remarkably unpalatial palaces ; a city of hundreds of districts with strange names  --  Crouch End , Chalk Farm , Earl 's Court , Marble Arch  --  and oddly distinct identities ; a noisy , dirty , cheerful , troubled city , which fed on tourists , needed them as it despised them , in which the average speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years , following five hundred years of fitful road-widening and unskillful compromises between the needs of traffic , whether horse-drawn , or , more recently , motorized , and the needs of pedestrians ; a city inhabited by and teeming with people of every color and manner and kind . When he had first arrived , he had found London huge , odd , fundamentally incomprehensible , with only the Tube map , that elegant multicolored topographical display of underground railway lines and stations , giving it any semblance of order . Gradually he realized that the Tube map was a handy fiction that made life easier but bore no resemblance to the reality of the shape of the city above . It was like belonging to a political party , he thought once , proudly , and then , having tried to explain the resemblance between the Tube map and politics , at a party , to a cluster of bewildered strangers , he had decided in the future to leave political comment to others . He continued , slowly , by a process of osmosis and white knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , to comprehend the city , a process that accelerated when he realized that the actual City of London itself was no bigger than a square mile , stretching from Aldgate in the east to Fleet Street and the law courts of the Old Bailey in the west , a tiny municipality , now home to London 's financial institutions , and that that was where it had all begun . Two thousand years before , London had been a little Celtic village on the north shore of the Thames , which the Romans had encountered , then settled in . London had grown , slowly , until , roughly a thousand years later , it met the tiny Royal City of Westminster immediately to the west , and , once London Bridge had been built , London touched the town of Southwark directly across the river , and it continued to grow , fields and woods and marshland slowly vanishing beneath the flourishing town , and it continued to expand , encountering other little villages and hamlets as it grew , like Whitechapel and Deptford to the east , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Islington in the north , Battersea and Lambeth across the Thames to the south , absorbing all of them , just as a pool of mercury encounters and incorporates smaller beads of mercury , leaving only their names behind .
