<p> Airline cowboy John Wayne Andrews may not have the experience to get his now-planeless Centennial Express commuter service airborne . <p> But neither did Herb Kelleher , a Texas lawyer who founded Southwest Airlines in the 1970s and turned it into the most successful airline in the skies today . <p> Friends of 52-year-old Andrews say that what he lacks in airline background he more than makes up through dogged determination , willing investors and a crew of former airline officials to advise him on how to make his idea fly . <p> Still , it wo n't be an easy course.Andrews has been battling since 1987 to start scheduled passenger service at Arapahoe County 's Centennial Airport . He believes the airport 's proximity to 1,000 businesses in the Denver Tech Center would make it a perfect base for a low-fare commuter airline . <p> So far stymied in Arapahoe County , Andrews has turned toward Jefferson County Airport , where it appears he stands a better chance . Still , he wo n't give up on Centennial . <p> " One word to describe John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bob Resling , an Andrews consultant and flight-standards director for DHL , an overseas air cargo carrier . " I think you 're going to see John Andrews at Centennial and Jeffco airports . Once he gets in , there will be others who will follow . " <p> Andrews , who describes himself as the " dealmaker " and CEO of the fledgling airline , anticipates an October startup of Centennial Express at Jeffco . <p> His one other experience as the head of an air carrier began in May 1979 and lasted about 15 months . In the midst of the Texas oil boom , Andrews launched Permian Airways to ferry oil executives from Midland Regional Airport in west Texas to Southwest cities . <p> He and his partners bought four nine-seat Piper Chieftains for about $ 1 million . Permian Airways , named after the geological basin in west Texas , grew quickly , operating from Midland to nine Texas cities , including Dallas and Houston , and three New Mexico cities . <p> Within months , though , Permian 's costs exceeded revenue . Even with full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high operating costs . Soon , the airline cut back its operations because of aircraft maintenance problems . <p> " Yeah , I put the airline together , " Andrews said . " The bottom line was that it was n't going to make it anyway because of the too-high seat-mile cost and too-thin routes . " <p> Andrews , 37 at the time , got out of the airline business for a short time and went back to his insurance agency . But by the early 1980s , he was watching Texans Lamar Muse and Herb Kelleher put together two low-fare airlines based in Dallas . Muse Air and Southwest Airlines competed for the Dallas and Midland route . <p> Andrews ' resume claims that he became one of the top 10 shareholders in Muse Air , the first nonsmoking airline in the country . By 1985 , though , Muse was heading for bankruptcy . That summer , Southwest bought Muse Air for $ 60 million . Andrews says he earned " several thousand dollars " from the sale of about 50,000 shares . <p> Southwest Airlines officials said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records to confirm Andrews ' claim . <p> Andrews also had been watching Kelleher , who turned Southwest into a moneymaker that now serves 55 cities in the West . <p> Andrews noted that one key to Kelleher 's success was headquartering Southwest at Dallas ' Love Field , which became a general aviation airport in the late 1970s after Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport opened . <p> Keying on the idea , Andrews and his half-brother , Don Elliott , bought nearly 200,000 shares in an upstart airline called Jet America , based in Long Beach , Calif . Andrews said that he and his brother became the largest shareholders . <p> " I was out there many , many times to look at the company , " Andrews said . " I made an offer to the board of directors that I wanted to find additional money to buy control of it . I do n't recall what happened . " <p> What happened was that Delta and Alaska airlines were bidding for Jet America . Alaska Airlines bought the airline , its six MD-80 jets and its routes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Jet America . A former chief executive of Jet America told The Denver Post through the Alaska Airlines communications office that he does n't remember Andrews . The ex-Jet America executive declined to be interviewed . <p> " Aw , they 're just pissed off that I tried to buy their company , " Andrews said , explaining the Jet America executive 's memory loss . " I got along pretty well with their maintenance guys . I did n't hit it off with management . " <p> Andrews has n't hit it off , either , with officials in Arapahoe County and Greenwood Village . They fear the noise of his operation at Centennial would disturb residents . In hopes of stopping him , they hired a Denver lawyer to explore Andrews ' past . After two months of digging , Andrews ' finances came up clean . " We did n't find any major debts or bankruptcies , " said the lawyer . <p> Andrews claims he 's got a group of investors , mostly in Texas , who can produce a $ 15 million to $ 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expects that $ 30 million would secure him a $ 200 million to $ 300 million loan to buy a fleet of 50-seat turbo-props at a cost of $ 14 million each . <p> The fleet of Saab 2000s , which fly a bit slower than most commercial jets , could enable Andrews to offer relatively low-cost fares from Jeffco and Centennial airports to several cities within two hours ' flight time . That would include Dallas , Albuquerque , Kansas City and New Orleans . <p> Jefferson County airport commissioners have offered no guarantee they 'd approve service any time soon , except to promise a series of hearings . A hearing is scheduled later this month to address noise concerns nearby residents have . <p> The Jeffco commissioners , who have already endorsed scheduled commuter service , have told the airport commissioners they want a favorable ruling . <p> Even if Jeffco authorities approve , Andrews will need to jump through several federal hoops . <p> Both Jeffco and Centennial airports are called " relievers , " in aviation jargon , because they take the overload of general aviation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certified to fly nonscheduled corporate and air taxi operations with fewer than 30 passengers per flight . To accommodate Andrews ' operation , Jeffco would need a federal certification allowing the airport to accept 30 to 59 passengers per flight . <p> The airport must upgrade to a 24-hour crash fire/rescue service on site and passenger security facilities . <p> Jeffco Airport Manager David Gordon says the upgrade could cost as much as $ 1 million for the first year , an expense Andrews promises to pay . <p> Centennial Express Airlines would need FAA safety certification , including qualified pilots , flight dispatchers and managers . <p> Andrews also must meet U.S. Department of Transportation " fitness " requirements , including proof of financial resources to keep the airline running for at least three months and a management team with experience . <p> The process will take four to six months , said Resling , a former FAA inspector who will guide Andrews through the certification . <p> " The airline industry is one of the most regulated industries , " Resling said . " If he 's not real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's real , the public will know that he 's compatible with the community and it will be safe . " <p> Andrews says he hopes to open his Centennial Airport base shortly after he opens the one in Jeffco , but some aviation experts say he does n't stand a chance at the airport that has repeatedly turned him down . <p> " There are two things that will stop any airline project : wetlands and lawyers , " said Michael Boyd , a nationally recognized aviation consultant based in Golden . " This project of Andrews ' does n't have wetlands , but it has lawyers . He 's never going to make it work because he will be fighting lawyers for the rest of his natural life . " <p> Andrews says he expects to fly out of Centennial Airport because the airport authority has violated federal aviation laws by accepting federal money and then turning its back on certain programs , such as passenger service . <p> The airport authority says part of the reason it has rebuffed Andrews is because the board promised nearby residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Legally , because they accepted federal airport development funds , this is a ' promise ' they did not have the authority to make , " Dennis Roberts , director of the state division of aeronautics , wrote in August 1993 . <p> Regardless , the authority sought and received a court injunction prohibiting Andrews from scheduled passenger service out of Centennial . Andrews was slapped with the injunction in January , immediately after he flew his first and only paying passenger from a small Texas town to Centennial Airport . <p> Andrews filed a complaint with the Federal Aviation Administration , asking the agency to enforce federal aviation regulations against Centennial 's exclusion of his intent for scheduled passenger service .
