<p> LAST JUNE , THE DRAMA DEPT. , A new not-for-profit theater company , astonished my colleagues by finding the life in one of Tennessee Williams 's more problematic failures , " Kingdom of Earth . " The play had flopped on Broadway as " The Seven Descents of Myrtle " in 1968 , only to be made into a ghastly movie titled " Last of the Mobile Hot-Shots " in 1970 . For those who saw " Kingdom of Earth " ( which I did n't ) , the Drama Dept. promised to be a bright new force on the New York theater scene . <p> That promise is honored with its second production : an impeccable revival of the seldom seen 1929 hit " June Moon , " the bitterly funny Ring Lardner-George S. Kaufman sendup of Tin Pan Alley . Though the limited run at the Ohio Theater in SoHo ends on Saturday , the production must stand as one of the delicious revelations of the current season . As directed by Mark Nelson and performed by an ensemble of some of New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a gin fizz with the kick of raw Prohibition hooch . <p> It reminds us of the theatrical wizardry and wit of Kaufman , whose collaborations with Moss Hart , Edna Ferber , Morrie Ryskind and Marc Connelly resulted in a remarkable number of classic Broadway comedies from the 1920 's into the 1940 's . ( A choice few : " Merton of the Movies , " " The Royal Family " and " The Man Who Came to Dinner . " ) It also calls attention to the singular gifts of Lardner , who died in 1933 at the age of 48 . <p> Lardner began as a sports reporter and columnist in Chicago and New York , later evolving into a hugely popular writer of short stories ( " You Know Me , Al " ) and novels ( " The Big Town " ) . His subjects : baseball players , boxers , businessmen , barbers and actresses , among others , all intensely dizzy people who have n't a clue about the true nature of their sometimes bleak predicaments . In his first-person narratives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American vernacular , a writer in the tradition of our 19th-century regional humorists . Yet it 's not by chance that the adjective most often used to describe his humor is " sardonic , " a word derived , so it is said , from a Sardinian plant that when eaten was supposed to induce convulsive laughter ending in death . <p> " June Moon , " based on Lardner 's story " Some Like ' Em Cold , " does n't end in death , but there is a mean edge to it that is uncharacteristic of Kaufman 's work with his other collaborators . It does n't slash with the broad , ruthless , side-splitting strokes of the great Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur farce , " The Front Page . " Rather , it has the structure of the kind of boy-girl romantic comedies its title suggests , but there is one large difference : virtually everybody in it is dangerously flawed , if not rotten to the core . <p> At the start of the play , Fred Stevens , its hero , who leaves Schenectady to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be an innocent . By the end , when he has attained his idea of fame , fortune and Ms. Right , he seems to be almost willfully dim-witted , on his way to a marriage that , after the honeymoon , will inevitably go sour . Why then is " June Moon " so funny ? It 's as sentimental as cyanide ; its skepticism is exhilarating . In addition , the characters , in spite of their thick skins , small minds and all of their furious double-dealing , remain naked and thus vulnerable from beginning to end . <p> There is also the language . New York , according to Fred , is a place " where they have the mecca for a man if you got the songwriting gift . " It 's pure Lardner . Or , as Fred tells Edna , the nice girl he picks up on the train to New York : " I got no use for a man who do n't respect woman 's hood . " Or , when he 's being most sincere in his courtship : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to endure a life of druggery . " Fred 's malapropisms are more than a humorist 's exaggerations : they approximate the earnest clumsiness of most thought . When you read Lardner 's dialogue or hear it on the stage , you might think he had invented talk radio . <p> Mr. Nelson is primarily an actor  --  he was the memorably obsessed Einstein in the New York production of Steve Martin 's " Picasso at the Lapin Agile . " It 's now clear that he is also a director of control , spirit and imagination . The Drama Dept. production never stoops to its dated material or sidesteps it . This " June Moon " is played legitimately , without apologies , as if it had been written yesterday . As Fred , Geoffrey Nauffts is all politeness , misplaced confidence and daffy inspiration . In the comparatively small part of Edna , Stacy Highsmith successfully suggests the steel that helps to keep a slightly pushy upstate girl pure in the big city . <p> But then the entire cast is near-flawless , all of the actors being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen on our stages these days . Robert Joy , Becky Ann Baker and Cynthia Nixon are very fine as , respectively , Fred 's haggard writing partner , Paul Sears , Paul 's grimly wise-cracking wife , Lucille , and Lucille 's predatory blond sister , Eileen . Note also Albert Macklin as the partners ' piano accompanist , who may be the only decent character in the play , and Peter Jacobson as the music company 's composer of dreadful novelty tunes . When last seen , he is trying to sell a number that starts : " Should a father 's carnal sins/ Blight the life of babykins ? / Mister , wo n't you give our child a name ? / A last name . " <p> Robert Lamont , who appears as the window cleaner at the music company , is worth his own paragraph , if only because the character is crucial to one of the funniest second-act curtain scenes ever devised for a three-act play . <p> Among the Drama Dept. ' s other members : the actors Billy Crudup , Hope Davis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justin Kirk , John Cameron Mitchell , Sarah Jessica Parker , Mary Beth Peil and J. Smith-Cameron ; the directors Mark Brokaw , Lisa Peterson , Randolph Curtis Rand and David Warren , and the writers Douglas Carter Beane , Peter Hedges and Nicky Silver . <p> Momentum is being gathered . ' The Two Gentlemen Of Verona ' <p> It is not exactly news to report that Shakespeare wrote great roles for great actors . But also for great dogs ? That was among the many pleasant surprises in the handsome , intelligent , consistently blithe production of " The Two Gentlemen of Verona " that closed last night at the Victory Theater on West 42d Street . At the performance I caught , even a little girl of possibly 10 or 11 , who sat across the aisle from me , seemed to be enchanted for most of the breezy three-hour running time . <p> The production , presented by the Theater for a New Audience in association with the International Shakespeare Globe Center , was the one seen in London last summer as part of the prologue season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opens in June . The staging was by Jack Shepherd , and Mark Rylance , the new Globe 's artistic director , was the effective star . <p> He played Proteus , the Veronese gentleman who chucks his romance with Julia ( Stephanie Roth ) and friendship with Valentine ( Lennie James ) when he falls in love with Valentine 's beloved Silvia ( Anastasia Hille ) , daughter of the Duke of Milan ( Matthew Scurfield ) . Proteus 's self-justifying excuse : " I to myself am dearer than a friend . " That is pretty much the narrative of this early work , which , for all of its windy wordplay , is a charming entertainment . It is also a test run for various plot devices ( including women disguised as men ) that Shakespeare would exploit more richly in the later romantic comedies . <p> The production at the Victory recreated as much of the look of an old Globe production as is possible in a modern proscenium house . The lights stayed on in the auditorium throughout the performance , some patrons were seated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the costuming was contemporary , as it would have been at the Globe . With the services of a first-rate acting ensemble , the pace seldom flagged . Most memorable were Mr. Rylance , Ms. Hille ( last seen here in the Cheek by Jowl production of " The Duchess of Malfi " ) , Ben Walden as Speed ( Valentine 's page ) and Jim Bywater as Launce ( Proteus 's page ) . <p> It was Mr. Bywater who had to deal with Crab , Launce 's scruffy , self-possessed dog , played at the Victory by a casually groomed , medium-sized black mutt that received no program credit . Whether or not the dog is theatrically trained , I have no idea , and it made no difference . Launce 's speeches to and about the animal are so craftily written that the text absorbed everything this Crab chose to do , whether flopping onto the floor with back to audience , barking in the middle of someone else 's speeches or staring vacantly out front , ostentatiously dreaming of home in Verona . <p> This dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There are 12 people in the cast of " Scapin , " at the Laura Pels Theater in the Criterion Center , but it functions almost as if it were Bill Irwin 's one-man show . In addition to playing the title role , Mr. Irwin directed the Roundabout Theater Company comedy and , with Mark O'Donnell , wrote this new English adaptation of the Moliere classic " Les Fourberies de Scapin , " about literature 's premier rascally servant . <p> Mr. Irwin is a phenomenally gifted mime , physical comedian and sketch actor . He can dance , fold himself inside a carry-on flight bag , appear to float and , possibly , play a soap bubble . Yet when appearing in a comedy as comparatively formal as " Scapin , " he might do well to seek the assistance of an outside director . He needs someone to tell him when his carefully planned but supposedly improvised , comic byplay begins to wear thin , that is , when it becomes less than spontaneous fun , in fact , a drag . <p> Though no one ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistaken identities and mismatched lovers , Mr. Irwin appears to think he has to let the audience know that he knows that it 's all nonsense . Thus he sends up the play 's mocking narrative by mocking it himself in asides to the audience , with jokey signs that read " Exposition " or " Unbelievable Coincidence " and , toward the end , by putting on contemporary drag and entering the stage action via the audience . He tries too hard to disassociate himself from the show he 's in charge of . <p> " Scapin " is best when it seems choreographed , rather than off the cuff . Keystone Kop-like chases always work , as do Moliere 's outrageous plot turns , at least when they are treated straight and not condescended to . You want to get into the spirit of the performance , but the grin gets stuck , becomes stillborn . Too bad . The cast is a good one and Douglas Stein 's unit set , which looks like a black-and-white woodcut , is exceptionally handsome . ' Victor/Victoria ' <p> Liza Minnelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But because of her figure and style , she is alarmingly miscast in the title role of " Victor/Victoria " at the Marquis Theater , where she is substituting for Julie Andrews through Feb. 2 . Ms. Minnelli can sing in her own special catch-in-the-throat way . She can dance . She also has her mother 's manner of never seeming to take herself too seriously . She can be an appealing as well as a powerhouse music-hall personality . <p> Little of this came through in the performance I saw , possibly because there was not enough rehearsal time . She dominates neither the show nor its only good number , " Le Jazz Hot . " Though she sings a brief solo in it , she participates in " Le Jazz Hot " as little more than a member of the chorus . <p> There is a further problem , which is that her looks are slightly androgynous to begin with . It is no big deal to see her playing a woman playing a man playing a woman . The image is blurry anyway . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she comes out wearing a formal black evening gown , it 's a shock for the wrong reason . In a formal evening gown , the tiny Ms. Minnelli looks like a child playing dress-up . <p> The show itself chugs along on automatic pilot . Tony Roberts , Michael Nouri and Rachel York continue to perform with more energy and conviction than the material honorably commands . Without Ms. Andrews , " Victor/Victoria " is a joke without a punch line . One grace note : the French farce hotel scene in the second act remains one of the funniest sequences that the writer-director Blake Edwards ever devised . It seems even better than when the show opened , but that could be because everything around it now is so drab .
