<p> CALCUTTA , India  --  Mother Teresa the compassionate nun has passed from this world . But Mother Teresa the icon , whose merchandising potential is as eternal as her message of love , is just beginning . <p> At a greeting card store just doors from Mother Teresa 's grave , owner Nuril Islam has pasted a poster of Mother Teresa in the display window surrounded by an array of sympathy cards . Inside , he opens a cabinet to pull out two boxes of plastic picture frames awaiting only her photograph before he can peddle them to Mother Teresa admirers . A Muslim who prays on the sidewalk outside his store , Islam is even casting around for rosaries to stock . <p> The neighboring Hot ' N ' Cold Fast Food Corner is negotiating to expand the seven-stool snack bar to handle the hungry hordes drawn to the anticipated Mother Teresa museum . Yet another store owner , who repairs clocks in a shop no bigger than a hall closet , plans to carry Mother Teresa wristwatches . Mother Teresa T-shirts already are on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about to introduce an upscale , artistic version of the shirts . <p> " She 's gone , and she is still giving to us , " said Sheikh Dulara , clutching a thick stack of photographs of Mother Teresa with Princess Diana that he sells for five rupees , about 15 cents , outside the grave site that has become an instant shrine . On the sidewalk below the iron-barred window , visitors leave candles , flowers and incense in front of posters of Mother Teresa attached to a metal road barricade . <p> In life , the iron-willed nun who was buried after a state funeral Saturday hated talking about herself and said she suffered media attention only because it helped the poor . <p> But in death she 's become something of a commodity , and every place she ever slept or worked is a potential draw for tourists and pilgrims should the Vatican anoint her a saint . Anyone who has ever visited Rome , Assisi or Lourdes has seen the profane and spiritual existing side by side . But there is an extra dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the order 's headquarters , which has only one telephone and no fax , computer or so much as an electric typewriter . <p> Neighborhood ambitions <p> Mother Teresa 's body now lies 3 feet under the Mother House dining room , where nuns held a memorial Sunday . Indians and foreigners alike , some armed with video cameras , so jammed the narrow alley waiting to view her grave that nuns in the trademark blue and white saris of the Missionaries of Charity had to elbow their way in . <p> The order intends to carve a new doorway leading directly to Mother Teresa 's crypt to accommodate visitors . The city of Calcutta , led for the last two decades by Communists , is considering a museum displaying Mother Teresa 's pens , diaries , rosary , Bible and metal can in which she washed her two saris . It may end up being just one stop of many . <p> Residents of the neighborhood around 14 Creek Lane , where then-Sister Teresa rented an apartment after she left the Loreto Convent in 1949 to start her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a vacant lot where they would like to see a Mother Teresa museum pop up . It 's now a working-class neighborhood , with narrow streets where mangy dogs sleep , undisturbed by car traffic . <p> " No doubt something is going to happen here , " said Michael Gomes , Mother Teresa 's landlord who now lives in the four-room apartment where Mother Teresa herself used to sweep all 49 wooden steps up to the third floor . " People have already come around asking me whether we should change the name of this lane to Mother Teresa Lane . " <p> Adhira Gayen , who has lived in the neighborhood all her 39 years , said neighbors hope to get government support for a Mother Teresa museum but are prepared to build it on their own . " Tourists are always welcome , " she said . <p> The church is more than a little ambivalent about all the fuss being made over Mother Teresa . The church is touched , yet it wants to keep the attention from escalating into hagiography . " It will serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose to others when we see things like the cot Mother slept on , " said Father Sebastian , a parish priest who oversaw the construction of Mother Teresa 's crypt . " But some of this is pure commercialism . It 's possible someone may start a cult around her . But not the Missionaries of Charity . " <p> Not everyone thinks the merchandising of Mother Teresa will be long-lived . " The T-shirts and other businesses will be around for a maximum month or so , " said Basistha Basu , editor of the Economic Times of Calcutta . " The hype is justified . Everyone here knew her . " <p> Larger than life <p> The hype of Mother Teresa is a bit awkward , both for the Missionaries of Charity and for upwardly mobile Calcuttans . The order is scrambling to survive the death of its charismatic founder . Like Mother Teresa , the nuns insist that God will provide and the work she began will continue . <p> But Mother Teresa was such a larger-than-life brand name that many Indians question whether funds will wither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the guidance of Sister Nirmala , Mother Teresa 's shy , bookish successor . So much better known was Mother Teresa than the name of the order she founded that even buses owned by the Missionaries of Charity carry her name in parentheses , as if they were inseparable . <p> She rarely permitted other nuns to be interviewed by the press . Now that she is gone , they seem to be foundering in the deep end . When Sister Nirmala was asked at her maiden news conference last week what would happen if poverty were eradicated , she said it would put the order out of business . Getting rid of poverty was not the nuns ' concern , she said . It was essentially Mother Teresa 's message , only more ineptly put . <p> Ordinary Calcuttans view Mother Teresa 's legend with equal measure respect and embarrassment . <p> Even as they have mourned a woman who nudged the middle class to look at the poor as humans deserving of dignified treatment , there is an undercurrent of resentment that she focused so much attention on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved immeasurably in recent years , and it aspires to become a capital of high technology . <p> In between the accolades , the Indian press has been filled with stories grumbling about all the media attention focusing on Calcutta 's slums in the last week , resurrecting the city 's image as one big pit of poverty . <p> How to memorialize <p> The debate is just beginning about how to honor the most famous resident of a city that has a huge , wedding cake memorial to Queen Victoria , who never visited here ; a children 's museum to India 's first prime minister , Jawaharlal Nehru ; and even a park named after Ho Chi Minh of Vietnam . <p> Father Sebastian , for one , has his own ideas about a memorial to Mother Teresa , and it has nothing to do with a museum to display her simple sandals or her patched sari . His parish includes the slum where Mother Teresa began her mission when she first opened a school outside the Loreto Convent . <p> " I would like to have the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basics of education , and a clinic where lepers can get medicine , " he said , sitting at his desk with a picture of Pope John Paul II under half of the glass top and Mother Teresa under the other . <p> " That would be a real shrine . A living shrine . Not with old stuff that people have picked up along the way . "
