<p> A **31;89;TOOLONG ! With that immortal nonsense , Little Richard introduced Tutti Frutti and invented rock ' n ' roll . <p> In this colorful music , nonsense is the language , and fiction is often the story line . <p> In fact , no fact should interfere with the building of a legend . Richard has been around long enough to compile a biography of colorful lies , inaccuracies and half-truths - some , perhaps , perpetuated by himself . <p> There 's the fascinating story that when Little Richard decided to renounce rock ' n ' roll materialism for the ministry in the late ' 50s ( he does n't remember the exact year ) , he was on tour in Australia and suddenly and compulsively tossed all his jewelry into the ocean . <p> " " A lot of that 's not true , " he said in a phone call from New Orleans , not specifying which portion was factual . " " People just made up a lot of stuff . It 's fabricated . " <p> Why , then , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just decided I did n't want to travel anymore , " he said . <p> " " It was n't for no preachin ' or anything . I did n't like flying . It was scary to me . " <p> Not exactly the stuff of legend . <p> Still uncomfortable in the air , Richard is on a Southern tour which brings him to the Arena Theater Thursday for his first Houston appearance in years . When he sees the place , which seats about 2,000 , he 's likely to be disappointed in light of his statement that " " We go to Birmingham after Houston , and I think we 've sold something like almost 80,000 tickets there . " <p> Something like that . <p> Regardless , Little Richard is on a comeback of sorts . Having returned to rock ' n ' roll years ago ( he wo n't say when , exactly ) , he has overcome a severe cocaine habit and lurid tales of sexual debauchery to contribute the children 's tune " " Itsy Bitsy Spider " to an album benefiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shake It All About " is a collection of children 's songs redone in his distinctive style . <p> " " At the age of 60 , I feel fantastic , " he said . " " I just feel grateful to God for allowing me to be here and for giving me longevity . " Little Richard ( there was no " " Big Richard " ) grew up as Richard Wayne Penniman in Macon , Ga. , the third of 14 children . He sang in the church choir , signed with RCA Records in 1951 after winning a talent contest and released two singles that went nowhere . <p> Returning to his dishwashing job at the Greyhound bus station , Richard sent a demo tape to Specialty Records . <p> While rock ' n ' roll had a parallel development from white country-boogie traditions around the Memphis area , Richard pioneered rock out of blues and rhythm and blues in such specialty classics as " " Tutti Frutti , " " " Long Tall Sally , " " " Rip It Up , " " " Lucille , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Knockin " ' and " " Good Golly , Miss Molly . " Never one prone to modesty , Richard nevertheless is dead-on when he exclaims , " " When I came on the scene , I had never heard rock ' n ' roll . I heard Muddy Waters , Elmore James , Sonny Boy Williamson . I heard Little Walter out of Chicago , singin ' blues . I heard , " My babe , she do n't stand no cheatin ' , my babe . ' <p> " " Even Chuck Berry was playin ' blues at the time , you know . <p> Fats Domino was doing blues . " <p> Rock , Little Richard said , was being formulated by such black artists as Ruth Brown , Roy Brown and Joe Turner . <p> " " I feel we were the originator , the emancipator and the architect of rock ' n ' roll . I 've always felt that - because rock ' n ' roll is truly nothing but rhythm and blues up-tempoed . And heavy metal is nothing but blues with effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Little Richard created the dazzling stage presence upon which rock ' n ' roll separated itself from its influences . Fastidious to the extreme , he wore makeup , capes and jewelry , and he developed a performing style based on wild , frenzied antics . <p> " " That outlandishness came from me wanting to be different , " he said . " " I wanted to do something that no one else was doing . <p> " " There was nothing around at the time but big bands - Count Basie , Tommy Dorsey , Buddy Johnson , Erskine Hawkins . Being young , we wanted something different . So I decided I would dress real colorful . " <p> Once the promoters saw its effect on ticket sales , Little Richard 's schtick won the day . <p> " " The promoters liked it because I drew crowds , " he said . <p> " " Other people did n't quite understand it - at first . " <p> Add to nonsense , then , flamboyancy as Little Richard 's gift to rock . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , we were doing way back . The only thing they have that we did n't was the huge stage . I made up for it in my entertainment and my energy . " <p> Richard professes to understand the new sounds , the new artists . Rap is " " the sound of today , " he said . " " It 's very artistic , to take things that are happening on the streets and rhyme them . <p> " " I like some of all of ( popular music ) , I must admit . " <p> In the mid- ' 50s , Richard was living in Houston 's Fifth Ward . <p> There , he met Otis Turner , a Houston schoolteacher whom Richard credits for teaching him " " to throw my leg on the piano . " <p> He also met saxophonist Grady Gaines . Gaines , who continues to play around town and is likely to join Little Richard onstage Thursday , became Richard 's band leader on tours . <p> " " I was living on Lyons Avenue , at the Crystal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a club there called the Club Matinee . They used to call it the Bucket of Blood . <p> " " I met Grady . We were all young . And I suggested we form a group together . So it was " Little Richard &; The Upsetters ' - his Upsetters , really . He was the leader of the band . <p> " " Grady 's a great musician , a fantastic entertainer , and he was a very handsome guy ; I 'm sure he still looks nice . And he was a gentleman . Grady - you ca n't beat him , he 's one of the best , he 's got that rock ' n ' roll thing . He makes that horn talk . " <p> Perhaps more than today , the rock pioneers of the ' 50s enjoyed cutting contests on stage during package tours . Upstaging one another was part of the initiation . <p> " " Oh , definitely , " Richard said . " " The whole show is based on that . I would be with the Drifters or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to take the show from each other . " <p> Jerry Lee Lewis , the great ball of fire , was perhaps one of Richard 's few equals onstage . To this day , though , they remain friends . <p> In fact , rivalries of those early days never derailed the bonds of friendship fostered by the pioneers . Gene Vincent ? " " A very good friend of mine . We used to tour a lot . " Bill Haley ? " " A very close friend . " Buddy Holly ? " " A very good friend . I have nothing but a great appreciation for all of them . They were fantastic . " <p> Richard retains his fondest admiration for Elvis Presley . <p> " " I love Elvis , " he said . " " I think Elvis was one of the greatest entertainers that ever lived , I think he was one of the most electric entertainers I 've ever seen , and I think he was the most handsome entertainer . He was full of energy , he was electrifying . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think he left us much too soon . <p> " " It 's sad , and a lot of things about him I do n't believe , because , you know , people can exaggerate .
