<p> The Washington metropolitan area 's Hispanic population has nearly tripled over the last decade and Asians have doubled in number , bringing thousands of new customers into the housing market . The real estate industry is scrambling to adapt to the changing conditions , industry experts say , and end discrimination against some groups . <p> Languages spoken by agents in one Shannon &; Luchs Co. office in Northern Virginia include Arabic , Spanish , Chinese and Vietnamese , with the agents coming from as many countries . <p> " Every ethnic real estate agent works twice as hard as the mainstream " agent , said Harold Pyon , a Korean American . In addition to helping their customers find a house they like , agents often must be translators and explain all the steps to take when looking for and buying a house , he said , adding , " It 's very complicated . " <p> About a third of the estimated 80,000 Koreans in the Washington area own homes , he said . <p> " Most Koreans who are first generation do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyon said . " We must translate American culture to the ethnic community . " <p> Many older Koreans distrust banks and traditionally keep their savings in cash at home . Loan officers are stunned when these buyers bring in a paper bag full of cash to cover the down payment , Pyon said . " They look at me and say ' What is this , drug money ? ' " <p> Man Pyon , Harold Pyon 's father , owns the Annandale-based ERA realty firm and employs about 18 agents , most of them non-ethnic . The younger Pyon , who takes care of sales to Asian customers , grew up in the United States and holds a chemical engineering degree from the University of Virginia . He believes longtime residents look on ethnic sales agents as second rate , a categorization he resents . <p> More than 230,000 Hispanics from many countries live in the Washington area , making them the area 's largest ethnic group , according to the 1990 U.S. Census . Their numbers have nearly tripled since the 1980 census . <p> " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Luis Lama , an agent with Long &; Foster Real Estate Inc. , explaining that his customers often want big houses with large , finished basements . " We need room for family gatherings so everybody can get together . " <p> This is the kind of house Maria Arandia , a native of El Salvador , looked at in Falls Church last week . It has three bedrooms and two baths , plus a basement . <p> She and her husband never have owned a home but they hope to buy one because " when I die I want to leave something " to their two daughters , Arandia said . <p> Lama , who came to the United States from Peru nearly 40 years ago , gives prospective buyers written information in Spanish and seeks out Spanish-speaking loan officers and real estate attorneys for his clients . <p> " Many people understand everyday English . They live and work in English but for the technical parts of buying a house they need to hear it in Spanish , " Lama said . They want explanations in their native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates and other details . <p> His clients often seek homes along the main roads because they want to use public transportation and to be near the city . <p> " In our countries everything is centralized around the capital , " Lama said . In Northern Virginia , Hispanic buyers like to live in Falls Church because it is close to the District , and along Route 50 and Lee Highway because public transportation is available . <p> They also want brick homes . " The U.S. is one of only a few countries that builds houses of wood , " which many believe will not last as long as stone , Lama said . <p> He said most of his customers did not own homes in their native countries , and buying a house here " ties them closer to this land . " <p> They also forge ties with Lama . " Customers call several years after " they have purchased a house , asking for advice about taxes , refinancing and other subjects , he said . <p> Sometimes they call because they 're ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Spanish-speaking people are getting educated and trying to get ahead , " Lama said . <p> During the recession , many Washington area owners lost their homes but few were Hispanic , he said . " We pay for our houses first " before spending money on other things . <p> Other ethnic groups have the same priority . <p> " The ratio of foreclosures is very , very low in our community , " said Dean Nguyen , the Vietnamese-born head of IMB Realty Corp. , which handles residential and commercial sales and leasing . <p> Nguyen is one of only two real estate agents in Virginia who have completed the extensive courses needed to earn all four professional designations available from the National Association of Realtors . <p> " If you lose a house , you lose face , " he said . <p> Family members and , in some cases relatives , work and contribute to the purchase of a house . Most prefer single-family houses but will settle for a town house or condominium , and work up to something larger , Nguyen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing in value rapidly , Vietnamese families took advantage of the market , and traded up whenever they could . <p> Vietnamese buyers , particularly the " older generation , " have " superstitions " that influence their decisions , Nguyen said . The direction a house faces can influence a family 's luck , for example , or a street that runs directly to the front of the house may bring ill fortune , he said . <p> Younger purchasers who have grown up in the United States often move away from these beliefs but may follow these rules , Nguyen said , because they are influenced by their parents . <p> He said many Vietnamese families move to Northern Virginia and Montgomery County " because the education system is very good and ... most of our people look on education as the number one priority . " <p> Lama , Nguyen and other real estate professionals said they have " Ten years ago there was no ethnic person in our office and now there are eight of us with ethnic backgrounds . "  --  Ann L. Brady , head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Asian and Hispanic clients . But some housing advocates disagree , and their view is bolstered by a recent national study . <p> The survey , covering 25 metropolitan areas of the United States , including the Washington area , found that Hispanics encountered bias 59 percent of the time when they tried to buy a home . <p> The study was conducted by black , Hispanic and white testers who were alike in income levels , education , employment and other characteristics except for race . <p> In a typical case , a white tester expressed interest in buying a house , and a short time later a black or Hispanic tester visited the same home or apartment . The testers then compared their experiences . <p> " There are a lot of things based on the language that present a barrier to homeownership , " said Elaine Grant , executive director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center in the District . " However , a larger reality is that discrimination is alive and well and functioning in the metropolitan area .

" <p> The answering machines at her home and office answer in Spanish and English , and most of the customers she and her husband , Bill , work with are Hispanic . <p> " Being bilingual has improved our business tremendously , " said Evelyn Calomaris , who was 5 years old when she moved to the United States from Central America with her family . <p> " You can count on one hand the number of real estate professionals who serve the Spanish community , " Bill Calomaris said . <p> Because of the limited number of Spanish-speaking attorneys and lenders , Hispanic buyers often do n't get the same quality of service that others receive , he said . <p> Ann L. Brady , an agent in Shannon &; Luchs 's Vienna-Oakton office who is also head of the Equal Opportunity Committee of the Northern Virginia Association of Realtors , said she is trying to change that . <p> The organization wants to help sales agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. market , Brady said .

The other agents are Arab , Taiwanese and Vietnamese , she said . <p> " The bottom line , " however , said Harold Pyon , " is that we are all Americans . "
