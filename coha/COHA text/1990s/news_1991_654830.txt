<p> FEDERAL guidelines now under development could force some states to scrap automobile emissions control programs that rely on private businesses to do the testing . <p> The guidelines are being prepared by the Office of Mobile Sources in Ann Arbor , Mich. , a branch of the United States Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) . When Congress reauthorized the Clean Air Act last year , it added 61 cities to the list of 90 that previously were required to conduct emissions tests . And it directed the EPA to develop an " enhanced " test for use in urban areas where ozone ( smog ) and carbon monoxide levels are " serious " or worse . <p> Last week the EPA began to circulate a draft " Guidance on Inspection/Maintenance " for comment . The 40-page document outlines four options for the enhanced test , ranging in stringency from slight to " very agressive , " says Jane Armstrong , senior project manager of the Ann Arbor office 's emission control technology division . <p> By May , the EPA will incorporate public comment into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final guidelines will be published in the Federal Register no later than Nov. 15 . <p> Some observers worry that the EPA , as an environmentally minded organization which has the power to mandate programs while leaving implementation to others , has already settled on the most stringent testing option , even though any of the four would satisfy Congress . <p> Ms. Armstrong says that 's " not at all " true , and that " public comment has an impact . <p> " We got an earful " last week when presenting the draft to interested state officials and businessmen at meetings in Washington and San Francisco , she adds . <p> Their concern focused on the likelihood that if either of the two most stringent options is made final , states that have decentralized testing programs will have to switch to centralized ones . The old rules let states choose . <p> Centralized programs are operated by a state agency or private contractor using multilane , single-purpose facilities that resemble a do-it-yourself car wash . Decentralized programs rely on service stations to conduct the inspections . Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in Massachusetts , New York , California , and Texas are decentralized . <p> Armstrong agrees that two most stringent options would put a burden of proof on states with decentralized programs to show that they could do the job . She adds that she doubts any could because , historically , decentralized programs are far less effective because of cheating , lax oversight , and the ability of motorists to shop around for a passing inspection rather than pay for repairs . <p> Larry Sherwood , who manages California 's program and attended the San Francisco meeting , says most people acknowledge that centralized testing is needed . But California would have a hard time changing , he says , citing the " enormous logistical challenge " and opposition from private firms that do the testing . These firms are already lobbying state lawmakers . State legislatures can not overrule the federal EPA , but they could engage in footdragging or lobby Washington for relief . " There are some deals to be made that have n't been made yet , " he says . <p> Another concern about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four options , which would require a controversial procedure called transient testing . This involves putting rollers under the drive wheels of the test vehicle . While the vehicle accelerates and decelerates according to a prescribed pattern , tailpipe emissions are sampled by equipment far more sophisticated than that now used . <p> Because it simulates real driving , transient testing is thought to be more effective than the steady idle tests in current use . <p> But Frank Sherman , a consultant who used to manage the Illinois emissions testing program , says transient testing has a host of drawbacks : <p> Lack of trial . While transient testing has performed well in isolated use , it has n't been subjected to the nonstop usage it would see at a testing center . <p> Equipment . At present it costs $30,000 to $50,000 to outfit one lane at a testing facility . The EPA estimates the new equipment would cost $150,000 to $450,000 . <p> Time . A vehicle can be tested in under three minutes currently . Transient testing would more than double the time . <p> Operating cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transient testing would push that to $40 to $60 . Illinois , which now provides free testing , might see costs go from $20 million to $120 million for its Chicago program . <p> Implementation . Transient testing would be performed on 1994 model and later vehicles , allowing testing centers to spread out the cost of outfitting emissions testing lanes . But increasingly , cars are being built with a computerized , onboard diagnostics capability that might spot the problems that would cause the vehicle to fail a transient test . " You really do n't know what a 1994 vehicle looks like , " Mr. Sherman says . <p> Alternatives . Other tests that the EPA is considering would achieve the desired emissions reductions at much lower cost . With these tests and vehicle onboard diagnostics , the gain from transient testing could be marginal . " There is some overlap , " Sherman says . <p> Impact on fleet testing . Illinois has a centralized program but allows owners of fleets of vehicles to hire private companies to test them . However , the high cost and immobility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done at centralized facilities . <p> " It could seriously jeopardize the fleet testing business , " says Keevin Schier , president of Mobile Emissions Testing Corporation ( METCORP ) . The Wheeling , Ill. , company tests 10,000 vehicles a year at the fleet owners ' sites , making it the largest firm in the country to offer that service . <p> DHL Airways in Chicago prefers to pay METCORP to test its 90 vehicles after hours , rather than go to the state for free testing . It 's more efficient and convenient than paying DHL 's drivers to wait at state facilities and have vehicles out of action , says fleet supervisor Bud Katamay . <p> Armstrong says that the new guidelines would still give states the flexibility to exclude their relatively small number of fleet vehicles from transient tests . <p> Enforcement . Mechanics are not going to have the expensive , laboratory-grade transient testing equipment , therefore would not be able to verify correcting an emissions problem detected by such tests , Sherman says . <p> " It 's important that mechanics be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says that many garages are already finding a need to own more sophisticated diagnostic equipment . She speculates that cheaper , garage-quality versions of the laboratory-grade equipment will come to be used by testing facilities and mechanics . <p> Transient testing is also defended as " extremely effective " by William Watson , manager of Arizona 's testing program . His state already has the most stringent tests in the country and does n't have the pollution problems that would require that test . But - with state population expected to double in 20 years - Mr. Watson is considering developing " something like " transient testing . " We know we ca n't just let it go . "
