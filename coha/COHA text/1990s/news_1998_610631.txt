<p> En route to fateful one-on-one negotiations with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein , with war and peace hanging in the balance , Kofi Annan did something entirely typical  --  he took a nap . <p> It does n't surprise those who know the U.N . secretary general that he could doze peacefully while facing the greatest challenge in a long diplomatic career , a moment captured by " 60 Minutes " cameras accompanying his mission . The man of the hour after negotiating the Iraqi weapons-inspection deal that 's averted war , at least for now , he 's famed for his tranquillity . <p> " He has an extraordinary calm , like an Indian yogi , " says Shashi Tharoor , Annan 's special assistant and part of his advance team in Baghdad . " It 's his style of responding to the world . " <p> In fact , longtime friends James and Toni Goodale had been invited to a small luncheon in Annan 's private dining room the very day the Iraqi crisis erupted a few months ago . " I watched Kofi , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not have a crease on his face or a furrow on his brow . He was cool and collected , graciously went through the lunch , charmed everyone , said goodbye , and then jumped into one of the biggest crises of his life . " <p> Praise for the United Nations ' first black African secretary general has been rampant this week , the talk of the talk shows . Skepticism reigned when Annan left for Iraq last week ; pundits wondered whether the soft-spoken career diplomat from Ghana could be forceful enough to wring concessions from Saddam Hussein . With armed conflict looming , embassies had already starting evacuating women and children . But following Annan 's triumphal return to New York , signed agreement in hand , U.S. Ambassador to the U.N . Bill Richardson graded him " a big A , first-rate "  --  and other diplomats , politicians and editorial writers joined in the accolades . <p> There have been some vehement denunciations , too . Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott ( R-Miss. ) suggested that the accord " leaves Saddam Hussein rejoicing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald Solomon ( R-N.Y. ) , charged that Annan " really sold us down the drain . " <p> Nevertheless , he 's riding a tide of attention and approval rarely accorded those who 've recently held his job . He is in many ways a different character from his predecessors . Behind the professional caution is a figure of storied warmth and charm , an American-educated cosmopolite as comfortable in the Midwest as in the Middle East . He and his wife , Nane , a Swedish artist , are frequent hosts and sought-after guests in social New York , making the rounds of chic little dinner parties , museum openings and  --  whenever they can " sneak away , " his wife says  --  movie theaters . <p> " If Kofi were n't secretary general , you 'd call him up and go out for a beer and have a great time , " James Goodale says . <p> Yet Annan 's greater visibility and intense networking is aimed at burnishing the U.N . ' s reputation and increasing the institution 's clout , associates say , not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says an obviously smitten CBS News correspondent Mike Wallace , who traveled with Annan to Baghdad . On the return flight , Annan " broke out the champagne and thanked his people for the work they 'd done , " he adds . " I 've known a couple of secretaries general ; they took themselves very seriously . He 's altogether different . " <p> Born in Ghana 59 years ago , Annan learned early on to straddle cultures and continents . He discovered America as an undergraduate at Macalester College in St. Paul , Minn. , a campus so committed to internationalism that it flew the U.N . flag beneath the Stars and Stripes . <p> " The Kofi Annan you see today is very similar to the Kofi Annan we knew 40 years ago , " says communications studies professor Roger Mosvick , who vividly remembers him despite having taught a good 20,000 students since . " He was always so likable and engaging . He never took a strong , confrontational position before he sought out the other person 's viewpoint . . . . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything . " <p> Supported by a Ford Foundation fellowship , Annan plunged into college life , traveling to debate tournaments , going to concerts and dances , playing soccer on a team with players of 11 nationalities . " He quickly learned our culture and how to get along with everyone , without compromising his own identity , " says classmate and friend Jack Mason , now a federal magistrate in St. Paul . <p> Annan 's Midwestern sojourn , plus graduate work in Geneva and at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , provided valuable early lessons , friends believe . " He can not only understand the problems and grievances of underdeveloped nations , he also understands the position of the West , " Mosvick says . " That makes him a very honest broker . " <p> Those who knew him at Macalester expected Annan to rise to prominence in Ghana . Instead , except for two years directing tourism development there , Annan has been a lifer at the U.N. , the first secretary general to rise from within the ranks . Fluent in French and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ languages , he held posts in Geneva , Cairo and Addis Ababa . Moving to New York in 1983 , he and his wife settled in the middle-class enclave of Roosevelt Island . <p> Toiling in unglamorous , largely anonymous management positions , Annan was at times focused on budgets , pensions and personnel . But he also shuttled the globe on sensitive assignments , negotiating the release of Western hostages from Iraq after the Kuwait invasion and beginning discussions on the " oil for food " formula of allowing humanitarian aid to enter Iraq . <p> His supervision of peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia , after Bosnian accusations of U.N . bungling , won thanks and praise from the Bosnian ambassador . " He 's straight and honest , he does n't spin webs of cleverness and deceit , he looks you in the eye , he listens , " Tharoor says . <p> By the time Annan took office last January , after being backed by the United States for the U.N . ' s top job , he seemed acquainted with nearly every one of the 6,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5,000 , after his reform and reorganization efforts ) . College classmate Mason and his wife , visiting U.N . headquarters a few years back , remember Annan leading them on an often-interrupted tour . " He knew everybody in the building , high and low , ambassador to doorman , " Mason says . <p> Some of the cheers that greeted Annan as he returned to the U.N . this week reflected that familial feeling . " You are one of us , " the head of the staff committee announced proudly as Annan , exhausted , shook his colleagues ' hands like a campaigning politician . <p> It 's his style to stop short while dashing to a critical meeting if he sees someone he knows in the hallway ; he asks about the person 's spouse and children or inquires after an ailing parent . " I think he early on taught himself that the 30 seconds ' wasted ' in personal contact are more important than getting to that meeting 30 seconds earlier , " Tharoor says . <p> All this considerable charm is now being focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization to which Annan has devoted his adult life . Some of his predecessors rarely traveled outside diplomatic circles . The Annans  --  his wife is a Swedish lawyer turned painter  --  are practically party animals by comparison , forging connections with artists and musicians , Wall Street financiers , publishing executives and , hardly coincidentally , media stars . <p> Annan showed up at ABC 's party for Ted Koppel at the Museum of Television &; Radio and Sally Quinn 's book party at the Four Seasons . He makes appearances in Liz Smith 's gossip column and chats easily on Charlie Rose 's television show . <p> Toni Goodale , a fund-raiser who first encountered Annan in Geneva when she was a college student on her junior year abroad , is throwing a celebratory dinner party for Annan next week , inviting " people he 'd like to know better . " The eclectic guest list includes CBS newsmen Wallace and Dan Rather and New York Times Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr . among the media contingent ; U.S. Attorney Mary Jo White ; Washington wheels Strobe Talbott , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and cultural lights like Lauren Bacall and Ron Silver . <p> The Annans entertain in the secretary general 's stately town house on Sutton Place , with its East River views and art from many cultures  --  including several of Nane Annan 's paintings  --  on the walls . When they met , they were both divorced and working for the Office of the U.N . High Commissioner for Refugees in Geneva . Their family includes three grown children , a daughter from her first marriage , a son and a daughter from his . <p> When he was a more obscure U.N . official , they could take long walks together , go to concerts and movies and museums . All that 's harder now that they 're encircled by bodyguards . But they did see " Titanic " and , earlier , the Harrison Ford thriller " Air Force One . " Annan jocularly responded to questions about whether the U.N . plane had a similar " escape pod " by noting that there was no pod  --  and no plane . But the couple did meet  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one rises to such a position without ambition , that 's not what old friends remember about Annan . <p> " You felt the presence of power without its being overt , " Toni Goodale says of the student she knew in Geneva decades ago . When Annan joined the U.N. , " I used to tease him , ' Oh , Kofi , you 'll be secretary general some day . ' He 'd say , ' Yes , and you 're going to be president of the United States . ' He 'd just joke about it . He 'd never say , ' You know , I think you 're right . ' "
