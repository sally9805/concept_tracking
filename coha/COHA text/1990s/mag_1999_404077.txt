Suma with her month-old male infant Forester // NEAR THE VILLAGE OF BUKIT LAWANG , in Sumatra s Gunung Leuser National Park , are a few buildings and cages that once served as a rehabilitation center for captive orangutans being reintroduced to the wild . Among the animals the center successfully released are two females known to park workers as Suma and Edita . In 1997 both gave birth to infants in the surrounding forest , and both infants died . On March 1 , 1998 , Suma gave birth again , this time to a male that park workers named Forester . But four weeks later , Edita stole Suma 's infant and carried it off through the trees as if it were her own . Slowly but surely , the baby began to decline . Edita could not have been lactating , so Forester was at risk of starving . Concerned for the infant 's survival , park staff used a banana laced with tranquilizers to lure Edita into an old cage left over from the days of rehabilitation . Once she became drowsy , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke out of the cage and ambled back into the forest . For four days , park staff and volunteers bottle-fed Forester to build up his strength . Then , on April 8 , they waited with the revitalized infant near a trail frequented by Suma on her daily rounds of the forest . As she came swinging into view , they quickly placed Forester into the crook of a tree . As soon as mother and baby made eye contact , Forester held up his arms to her , like any infant missing Mom . Pursing her lips in greeting , Suma scooped up Forester and immediately began grooming him . Reunited , they moved back into the forest . Although this was the first time kidnapping had been reported among wild orangutans , grabbing babies is nothing new for most other primates-and often it 's a positive thing . Females of many Asian and African species of leaf-eating monkeys , for example , routinely pull babies from their mothers ' chests and pass them around like rag dolls . Researchers believe this system , which they call infant sharing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the demands of baby care ) and " aunts " ( by giving them mothering experience ) .

Relatives , in particular , are likely to be in physical proximity to infants and to be tolerated by mothers . In fact , orphaned primate babies have frequently been adopted by kin . Nonrelatives are also attracted to little ones and often look , touch , or try to pull a tiny infant away from its mother . Primate infants are often the center of attention , and researchers suspect that being in the spotlight provides a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced females have been known to take infants from their mothers and keep them too longsometimes for days-thereby putting the babies at risk of starvation . Sometimes abductions seem purposeful , meant to eliminate the competition : high-ranking female Japanese and rhesus macaques have been observed taking newborns from low-ranking troop mates and holding onto the babies until they are dead . Photograph // It is not just females that abuse youngsters . Male Barbary macaques steal infants and use them as pawns as they jockey for social status . The infants are held for hours and sometimes caught between these lumbering giants during a fight . In many species of monkey , including the hanuman langur and chacma baboon , males routinely grab unrelated babies and kill them , presumably to end nursing and bring the mothers into estrus again . A rival 's offspring is thus eliminated , and an opportunity to spread one 's own genes created . Because of these very real threats , most mothers protest when their infant is whisked away . Although no one witnessed Forester 's kidnapping , it probably was not pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a decade earlier and had been living rather solitary lives around Bukit Lawang ever since . They must have known each other but were neither relatives nor friends . Perhaps Edita was still mourning her previous year 's loss . Many primates express grief after infant loss-female monkeys and apes may hold their dead infants for days and weeks or haunt other females with newborns after losing their own . While the kidnapping was a desperate move , Edita 's behavior reminds us that the roots of longing run deep , and that maternal instinct can be compelling , even without maternity <p>
