" Get that ! " The story goes . " His name is Sinatra , and he considers himself the greatest vocalist in the business . " <P> This is the bandleader Harry James talking in 1939 , when Frank Sinatra , of Hoboken , N.J. , had not yet moved the world . " No one 's ever heard of him ! He 's never had a hit record , and he looks like a wet rag , but he says he 's the greatest . " Said it . Meant it . Proved it . <P> Harry James must have sensed it too , because he had hired Sinatra , then a scrawny spoiler in his mid-20s , to sing with the band . Present at the creation , James could not have read the signs . The title of an early Sinatra-James hit was one of those anthemic declarations of defiance that , over the years and through the decades , was to form the Sinatra autobiography : All or Nothing at All . <P> That was Sinatra , then , now and ever : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his passing was uncharacteristic . It should have been something quick , furious , defiant . Instead , when he died of a heart attack last week at 82 , it was lingering , pernicious , sad . He last performed live in the winter of 1995 , but he was unsteady on his feet , and lyrics he 'd known for years eluded him . His last original recorded tunes were the studio stunts of the two Duets albums , in which Sinatra revisited some of his classic songs in the company of spryer admirers , from Streisand to Bono . <P> But for the first time , the music was not enough to see him through . Age encroached . His attention strayed . His mind slipped . " Where am I ? " he said one night , not too long ago , startled , looking up at the stars . " At the beach , " he was told . " You 're home . " He nodded , but that look of sudden , alarmed absence stayed with him more and more . <P> His 80th-birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Friends and luminaries from across the generations paid their respects . Bruce Springsteen showed up , singing Angel Eyes as one Jersey boy to another . Bob Dylan performed his own song , Restless Farewell , and said , looking down from the stage at Sinatra , " Happy birthday , Mr. Frank . " It was homage of a high order . The room was heavy with talent that night , but Sinatra contented himself with showing his appreciation by applauding them all . Not so many years before , he would have led them . Showed them all how the Chairman does it . But when he took the stage , proudly shaking off Tony Bennett 's helping hand on his arm , he smiled and waved and sang only a little . The music stayed inside him . <P> That was a bit of a disappointment . A last triumph , a standoff against encroaching fate , would have crowned the evening and rounded memory with a perfect dramatic closure . Too much to expect perhaps , but in a sense that was Sinatra 's own fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least we could expect from him . Not as excess , mind , but as abundance . So much heart , so much sorrow , such delicacy and such braggadocio , all for the music he made indelible , with enough to spare so that it spilled over into his life and into all the public refractions of it . <P> Sinatra lived the music at every tempo , the sad soul of it as well as the brash , brassy swing . Or maybe his need to graft his life onto every song he sang was an unintended effect of his artistry , a scramble to find personal corollaries for every melody he molded , every lyric he bent to his own will and purpose .
