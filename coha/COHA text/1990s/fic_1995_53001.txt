The heat lay weighted and immobile on every square inch of skin . It drew the air out of the lungs and only grudgingly gave some of it back . Out beyond the hood of the moving car waves of it rose from the pavement like an undulating barrier . <p> Sim was driving and now he glanced over at George in the passenger seat . He sat there with his big hands in his lap , his mouth gaping , the thin blond hair on his scalp plastered with sweat . Last night there had been heat lightning out on the horizon , but never any rain , never any rain for a month now , and he 'd told Sim : " He 's out there . He 's out there sprinkling lightning bolts across the land . " And Sim , thin and dry as August , had said : " George , it ai n't nothing out there but the weather . " And George had answered , " No , Uncle Sim , it 's the weather man . " Sim had stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew , his brain gone south  --  what could you do with him ? So he had simply looked out over the darkened fields of wheat , threatened on the one hand by drought and on the other by the possibility of a storm . <p> After a while he 'd said : " We 'll drive into Jefferson tomorrow afternoon and get ready to pick up your mother from the bus . She do n't get in till Wednesday , but weal stay overnight , maybe take in a movie . How 'd you like that , George ? " <p> " I 'd like it fine , but it wo n't get rid of that old weather man . " <p> Just those three , the uncle , his sister , her son , living in the old white-frame farm house . It was company , Sim thought , and old and lonely as he was , he was grateful for it . He was even grateful for George . <p> Now they drove through the oppressive heat toward Jefferson , and George sat there , seemingly without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes on inside him ? Does he remember them  --  his family ? The boy  --  why the hell am I thinking of him as a boy , he 's over forty  --  the boy never smiles . There 's a deep melancholy river that runs through him , and he may not even know its source . <p> George staring through the : windshield . George breathing shallowly through an open mouth . George with that great sad face and those eyes like a basset hound 's . <p> Sim said : " When we get to Jefferson , we 'll check into the motel and then go get some fried chicken at Tull 's . " He was trying to cheer him somehow though he knew he never would . <p> " That 'll be fine , " George said . <p> " I know you like fried chicken . You always liked it . Why , May  --  " He shut his mouth . Why had he brought up May ? " The weather man got her , Uncle Sim . " <p> Sim gripped the sweaty steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then that thing he sent at the house , that black twisty thing he took out of his old black leather bag , it ripped everything to flinders . " <p> " George , I  --  " <p> " They say one of them flinders hit me in the head . That that 's why I 'm like I am nowadays , but that ai n't what happened . The weather man did it . He did it deliberate . Then he left me for dead . He did n't want me to tell anybody I 'd seen him . He did n't want his secret let out . " <p> " George , I 'm sorry . I should n't have brought it up . " <p> " I was all right before that , was n't I , Uncle Sim ? You knew me then . I could think like anybody else and I was working Dad 's old farm and I was doing just fine . That 's the way it was , was n't it ? " <p> " You were a born farmer , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how good it was and what for . You still got some of that in you . " <p> " The weatherman did n't take that away . But he took everything else away . " <p> A tear rolled out of George 's eye . He seemed unconscious of it . <p> " May . I ca n't remember what May was . Was she my wife , Uncle Sire ? " <p> Sim nodded dumbly , unable to speak . <p> " What must I have been then ? To have a wife , I mean . Why , even you never had a wife , Uncle Sim . " <p> " I was too dry and sour for one , George . And too homely . If I ever could 've got one though , I would 've wanted her to be just like May . " <p> " Like wheat in sunshine , that 's the way her hair looked . Or maybe I just said that to her sometime , trying to impress her . Would I have done something like that , Uncle Sim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that way about you that you got from your father . " <p> " And then that old weather man came along and took it all away from me . Such a little man to cause so much harm . " <p> Do n't let him mention the child , Sim thought . Do n't let him remember crawling through the debris with blood in his eyes and finding her broken body . Spare me that one today , there 's already enough misery in my life . <p> George 's mind shifted again . <p> " I sure look forward to that fried chicken at Tull 's , " he said . And then he lapsed into silence without his face ever having changed its melancholy cast . <p> They put up at a motel on the edge of town just off the interstate . Behind it fields of wheat and corn stretched away without a break to the horizon . <p> The double-bedded room seemed luxury enough compared to the farm house , yet Sim missed his rocking chair and the view off the front porch and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of the bed and watched some kiddy show on the room television , his face so serious that you would have thought it was a lecture in nuclear physics . <p> Around six-thirty they got dressed and drove over to Tull 's . It was an old family restaurant with checkered tablecloths and fresh-faced high school girls to serve you . There were always kids in there , always some young mother trying to eat with one hand while she soothed an infant with the other . And across from her there 'd be dad and a slightly older kid , slathering butter on hot rolls and putting them away like they were caramels . <p> Sim liked it . He liked the grandpas and grandmas and sons and daughters and grandsons and granddaughters at the longer tables . It made him sad though to be sitting there with his nephew George and not be one of them , the grandpa maybe with a rich life behind him . <p> Besides themselves there was only one other person who was n't with a family . He sat at a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a black vest and a black tie . Sim found himself wondering what his profession might be . Undertaker , he thought . Or maybe hangman . <p> The man ate his soup , pausing every once in a while to survey the room and give it a little smile . Once he caught Sim 's eye and gave a nod . The man 's own eye seemed like that of a crow or a jackdaw , looking out at the world of men from some other , older form of intelligence . <p> After a while the man finished his soup and picked up his check and headed for the cash register . He had a black valise in his hand , the kind that old-time doctors used to carry . Maybe that 's what he is , Sim thought . But more likely he 's a drummer . <p> They ate their hot rolls and fried chicken and corn on the cob and mashed potatoes with gravy . Then they followed up with huge slabs of apple pie a la mode and sat back content  --  even George for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Sim . " <p> " If one of them diet ladies on the television could see us now , she 'd have us thrown in jail . " <p> When they stepped back outside , the night was hot and still . It seemed to be waiting for something to happen , something fearful and unpleasant , and all their good feelings evaporated into thin air . <p> George stood stiffly in the restaurant parking lot and gazed off to the northwest where the sky seemed especially black . <p> " He 's here , Uncle Sim . He followed us from the farm . " <p> " Who 's here ? " Sim asked , already knowing the answer . <p> " That old weather man . " <p> " Let 's get back to the motel , George . " <p> He took him by the arm and walked him over to the car and got him in the front seat . All the way back to the motel George kept turning his head and staring off to the northwest . This was about the time of year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes him edgy . <p> Sim tried to get George 's mind off it . <p> " Want to run over to the movie theater ? " " I do n't feel like it , Uncle Sire . " <p> " It 'll take your mind off things . " <p> George turned and stared at him . " That 's just what I do n't want , Uncle Sim . Maybe I can catch him this time . Maybe I can stop him just once . Then maybe he 'll think twice about doing it again . " <p> " Dammit , George  --  " <p> " Somebody 's got to do it . Somebody 's got to do it just once . " <p> " You 're not the man , George . " <p> " That 's what I 'm afraid of , Uncle Sim . " <p> Sim got him back to the motel and took him to their room and put hi m to bed with the television for company . Maybe his mother could handle him when she came in on the bus tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He got his pipe and tobacco and went out back of the motel where there was a little bit of lawn . The field of wheat came right up to it , separated only by a wire fence . <p> Sim stood there and smoked his pipe and gazed off into the darkness . The night had become more and more . oppressive . <p> " Do you think it 'll rain ? " a voice said behind him . <p> He spun around . The little man from the restaurant was there . He still had the doctor 's valise in his hand , but now he wore a hat . Sim thought it was a bowler  --  something you only saw in old movies and photographs . <p> " It may rain , " Sim said . <p> The man smiled enigmatically . " Yes . Yes , I believe it will . " He was silent a moment , then he said : " It 's been a long time since I 've been in these parts . I should 've known they 'd put a town along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this town 's been here a hundred years or more . " <p> " Has it ? Has it now ? How time flies . " <p> Sim laughed nervously . A joker , he thought , and yet it had n't sounded like a joke . " What trade are you in ? " he asked . <p> " Oh I 'm a traveling man . " <p> " What exactly do you sell ? " <p> " Sell ? I do n't sell anything . I give little demonstrations of what I can do . Why , I gave a little demonstration over in Centralia just last week . Of course , one day the home office will come through and show people what really can be done . They 've been preparing it a long time . Biding their time so to speak . " <p> " I 'm not getting your drift , stranger . " <p> " Are n't you ? Well . Let 's just say my particular line of business is a little hard to describe . And yours ? " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ah . " <p> " It 's an honest profession . " <p> " I did n't say it was n't . Rather risky though , would n't you say  --  what with the weather and all ? " <p> " The weather can do a man in all right . " <p> The man smiled again . " I quite agree , " he said . <p> They stood there without speaking and all around them everything seemed still as death  --  even the traffic on the interstate . <p> " I must be off ' , " the man said at last . " I have some samples I need to deliver tonight . " <p> " Kind of late , ai nt it ? " <p> " Oh late 's just fine . It 's the best time of all , in fact . " <p> And then he tipped his bowler and ambled away into the darkness . <p> Sim stared after him a moment , then tapped out his pipe and headed back toward the motel . There was a pale face at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all at once it disappeared . <p> Sim walked back into the motel building , something making him hurry his steps . He reached the bottom of the stairs , then found himself running breathlessly up them . When he got to their room , the door was partway open . He stepped inside . No sign of George . No sign of the clothes he 'd worn either or his shoes . <p> Sim crossed to the window . He flung back the drapes . The lawn below was empty , but far out in the wheat next door he sensed something moving . <p> George , he thought . What the hell 's got into you ? <p> He hesitated a moment longer , then headed for the door . As he reached the top of the stairs , an unexpected quiver of fear ran through him . <p> * * * <p> George followed his trampled trail through the wheat field . He did n't think the terrible little man knew he was behind him , but you never could tell . He might be leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started the day he 'd killed May and Marjorie . Shut him up forever . Keep George from telling about him although he need n't have bothered since nobody believed him anyway . <p> That bowler hat  --  he 'd remembered that all right . <p> And then he 'd seen him back of the motel with that valise of his - talking to Uncle Sire of all people . Was Uncle Sim in with him somehow ? No , he could n't believe that . Sim was like everyone else . He thought the weather was just , well , weather . <p> That little man in the bowler hat . All the trouble he 'd caused . All the heartbreak and suffering . Those black twisting beasts he carried in his bag-they 'd be bumping around right now , anxious to be out . That was why the air was so still . It sensed them coming and was afraid . <p> A fragment of breeze swept across the wheat field . Its cool fingers touched his face like a blind man trying to identify one of the sighted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's getting ready . Soon he 'll let one of those things out and it 'll turn everything to flinders . <p> The breeze rose some more , roiling the wheat stalks like wind in water . He could smell the dry soil it raised and the vegetable grit from the wheat . Some of it got in his eyes and blurred them . <p> He blundered onward . May , May , he thought . Hair the color of wheat in sunlight , like cornsilk under his hand when he crashed her to him . The pink of her cheeks , the way it had spread to her bosom that first time they 'd innocently fondled in the back seat of the car . Had that really been ? Or was it just something his poor fuddled mind had lifted from a TV show or a movie ? <p> And Marjorie  --  oh God Marjorie ! Her broken body cast by the terrible beast among the debris of the house . So pale in the greenish light , hair like cornsilk , too , but plastered now with rain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch  --  like warmth would never touch it again . <p> His eyes blurred again , this time not from grit but from awful remembrance . <p> The wind blew harder . It gusted and shook and sent a quiver through his bones . <p> All at once he came to a place where the wheat had been flattened in a great arc . And there in the center of the arc the man in the bowl er hat crouched beside his valise . <p> He looked up once and his eyes flashed green  --  like the light blink that 's sometimes seen at the setting of the sun . George had n't yet emerged from the standing wheat and he crouched in the wind-whipped darkness . The man in the bowler hat went on with his work as if he had n't seen him . <p> He had the valise open and that was where the wind was coming from , pouring out of it in an endless stream . The valise appeared to be filled with little leather bags that bumped around as if they had animals inside them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , decided it was n't what he wanted , put it back . <p> He rummaged some more , took out two or three other bags , put them back also . Each quivered in his hand as if anxious to be free , then bounced around in frustration as he thrust it into the valise . At last he found the one he was looking for . A slow , mean smile curled across his lips , <p> He slipped the bag into the side pocket of his coat , closed the valise , put it to one side . The wind that had been worrying the wheat field died away to nothing . In the sudden silence that followed George could hear the little bag bumping around in the man 's pocket . <p> He took it out . He pinched the top of it with his thumb and forefinger . He slowly eased the drawstring , The thing knew it was going to get out now . It seemed to be gathering itself for the rush . <p> He placed the leather bag on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came . A tiny twisting funnel of darkness that seemed to gather an eerie green glow about itself . <p> The breeze rose up again . It flowed past George 's ears into the center of the flattened arc of wheat . That thing was gathering it in from all directions . It was feeding on it . It was growing . <p> The man drew ' something that looked like a pointer from his inner coat pocket . He extended it until it was nearly three feet long . Then he began using it on the black twisting funnel , tapping it here and there , making it do what he wanted . <p> The thing was as high as a man 's knee now . George could hear the rushing sound it made  --  like a big electric fan on high speed . He heard the snap , too , of the little green and yellow sparks of lightning it made . <p> The beast , he thought . And his knees went soft . <p> The beast that killed them all . <p> The wind rushed more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall as a large man now , as big across as a grizzly bear . It roared with anger and desire . The man strutted around it like a lion tamer , stepping back when it lunged at him , then snapping the stick at it to show it who was boss . <p> It grew larger still  --  a raging rhinoceros now , then a T. rex . The man remained its strutting master , laughing at the sheer power of the thing he held in check , his awful green eyes flashing with joy . <p> There were lightning strokes now within the funnel , real lightning that sizzled and boomed . The thing flung itself about , towering the noise of it like an express train , like a dozen express trains . The man threw back his head and roared with laughter . <p> George was on his hands and knees . His fingers clawed the earth in an effort to keep himself from being blown away . It was going to be like the last time . Only this time it would kill him , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marjorie ! " <p> Some force seemed to rise up in him then . A thing almost the size of the loss he had suffered . He rose up , fighting the wind , and lunged across the flattened wheat toward the man in the bowler hat . <p> The man saw him coming . He made a sweeping gesture with his pointer and an arm of wind . seemed to boil out from the twisting funnel . It drove at George and hit him square and sent him rolling to the ground . <p> He felt his nose crunch and tasted blood in his mouth . But he picked himself up anyway . Another terrific blow from the whirling beast . He was looking straight up at the towering mass of it as he rolled in the dust . <p> Sim , he thought . Help me . <p> But there was no Sim . Not here anyway . He 'd have to do it alone . <p> He got himself up on his hands ; and knees . The man in the bowler hat was dancing around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great beast roared and roared , and blinding strokes of energy crackled within its awful funnel . George gathered himself . He lunged . That fool of a man thought he was down for good . Thai fool of a man was looking the other way . And now George grappled with him . <p> They crashed to the ground . The pointer broke into a dozen pieces . The man 's breath was in his face and it smelled like the ozone after a lightning strike . George closed his hands around the man 's throat . <p> Above them the whirling beast seemed to hesitate . Its master was down and now it was free . But which way should it go ? In which direction lay the most prey ? It suddenly made up its mind , plunging across the wheat field toward the interstate and destroying everything in its path . <p> The man threw George from him as if he were a child . Then he struck him and George rolled a dozen feet across the flattened wheat . <p> " You filthy little farm boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . " You 've done it now ! You let that thing get away before I was ready and now it 'll miss just about everything in the town ! " <p> He gathered up his fierce little body and struck again . George rolled over and over in the dirt . <p> " I wanted to flatten that town , boy ! I wanted to show those people just how feeble and insignificant they are ! That 's my job ! That 's my profession ! Oh you 'll pay , boy ! You do n't cross me ! You do n't cross the old weather man ! " <p> His hand darted under the lapel of his coat . George lay there broken and helpless , unable to move . The man 's hand came out again crackling with fire . He drew it back as you 'd draw back a spear hand and suddenly there was a dancing lightning holt there . He flung it straight at George 's chest . <p> George screamed as it hit him , and his scream chased off across the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tornado caught Sim in the open , but he was able to fling himself into a ditch and survive . It tore the roof off the motel . It killed a mother of four in the parking lot . It ripped up trees and tossed cars around and then fled into the night without hitting the town itself . <p> Sim worked his way back to the motel as the last of the rain fell . He got a flashlight out of their battered car and returned to the wheat field . It took him a long time to find George 's body , but finally the flashlight picked it out , spreadeagled in the mud . <p> Sim put the beam on his face . The jaw hung slackly open and the empty blue eyes bugged horribly . No melancholy there now . Something worse . Something much worse . <p> As he turned away , a cold . gust of wind struck his cheek . It was like something out of the grave . The weather man , he thought . And shivered in spite of himself . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine flood , we must also explore heat .
