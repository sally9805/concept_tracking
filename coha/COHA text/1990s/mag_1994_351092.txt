DURING A SINGLE WEEK LAST MONTH in the District of Columbia public schools , two high school students were shot and seriously wounded , another student was stabbed by a sixth-grade girl , an assistant principal was punched in the face , and a policeman was assaulted by students . Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly responded to the mayhem as big-city mayors often do : she announced plans to post 60 more cops on campus . But her predecessor in the job is convinced that a higher power is required . Ex-mayor and now councilman Marion Barry has proposed a law allowing students to lead nonsectarian classroom prayers . " Maybe , just maybe , it will turn some of our values around , " he says . " We 've lost our way . " <P> Barry , who served six months in prison for drug possession after leaving office as mayor , might seem a curious proponent of piety , but his campaign is no oddity .

Congress has caught the fever this year as well . Both the Senate and House passed measures that would strip funds from schools that forbid " voluntary " prayer . Final action on prayer legislation is expected this spring . <P> The American Civil Liberties Union has vowed to challenge the constitutionality of these new laws . Representative Don Edwards , a California Democrat , argues that student prayer is not really voluntary and amounts to " manipulation by churches and parents . " He points to numerous lower-court decisions against such praying . <P> A pending high-court decision could change the landscape significantly . It revolves around the 1971 Lemon ruling , which bars tax support for salaries and secular textbooks in religious day schools . The decision set up a three-part test to determine whether a government action is an unconstitutional infringement of church-state separation : an action must have a " secular legislative purpose , " avoid " excessive government entanglement with religion " and have a " primary effect " that " neither advances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
