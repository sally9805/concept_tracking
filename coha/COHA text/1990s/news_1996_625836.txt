<p> SAN MARCOS - Texas sheriffs - tradition holds - walk tall , say little and trail in their wake the aroma of nicotine , gunpowder and manly sweat . <p> But there 's a peculiar new scent in the air of this year 's Hays County sheriff 's race : smoldering marijuana . <p> March 's Democratic primary pits Chief Deputy Don Montague - a straight arrow , longtime lawman who boasts of his drug-fighting efforts - against Jeffrey Walter " " Zeal " Stefanoff , a marijuana proponent and environmental activist <p> It 's a race of which retiring Sheriff Paul Hastings has observed : " " We have a president who never inhaled and a sheriff 's candidate who has n't exhaled since 1974 . " <p> " " You could say , " Stefanoff wryly said of his opponent , " " that we are complete opposites . " <p> The differences are profound . <p> Montague , 48 , wears a white hat . <p> Stefanoff , 43 , wears a ponytail . <p> Montague , a former highway patrolman , has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed 60 hours toward a law enforcement degree at Southwest Texas State University and more than 1,100 hours of other professional training . <p> Stefanoff holds an anthropology degree from Southwest Texas , where he maintained a 3.8 grade-point average and consistently made the dean 's list . An Army veteran , Stefanoff prides himself on his lack of law enforcement experience and on his record of civil disobedience . <p> His familiarity with the sheriff 's office , he said , comes from the 180 days he spent in jail three years ago after smoking a marijuana cigarette during a protest at the San Marcos police station . <p> The primary race has galvanized San Marcos , a generally liberal college town 30 minutes south of Austin , the state capital that also has been described as the " " hemp capital of the Texas Hill Country . " From the courthouse square cafes to the county 's backroad groceries , conversation centers on the the match between the cop and the hippie . <p> " " Not in my wildest dreams , " sighed Montague , " " did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But , Jim Coley , the lone Republican running for sheriff , said no one should take Stefanoff 's candidacy lightly . <p> Coley , who is chief investigator with the Hays County District Attorney 's Office , noted Stefanoff is extremely intelligent , but added : " " I do n't believe anyone who has been convicted of a crime should be sheriff of any county . " Political observers believe Stefanoff - who earlier mounted a convincing but unsuccessful bid for county commissioners court - could garner 30 percent of the March 12 vote . <p> And one , who is associated with the county 's liberal Democratic establishment , fretted Stefanoff might actually win the primary only to go down in defeat in November . <p> " " Stefanoff , " she allowed , " " has the courage of his convictions . <p> He was willing to go to jail for them . " But while he may attract media attention outside Central Texas , she added , he is not a major player in Hays County . <p> " " He 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a two-issue candidate . His issues are marijuana and the environment . " Stefanoff agrees . " " Hays County , " he said , " " is a garden of Eden . " When he moved to the area in 1978 , the Cincinnati , Ohio , native was impressed that " " you could drink the water right from the streams . " <p> It was that beauty - along with the freedom to use marijuana for all purposes - that propelled his activism as publisher of " " The Guardian , " an occasional publication he described as a " " pamphleteering intellectual trust . " While in San Marcos , Stefanoff became co-producer of a film documentary dealing with the plight of Nicaraguan women during their country 's civil war , worked with food bank and refugee housing services and lent his support to various political campaigns . <p> Even as he guides his bid for sheriff , he is planning an unlicensed low-watt FM radio station that would serve the San Marcos area . While technically not illegal , such a station would appropriate an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in court . <p> Stefanoff , who lives near the Hays County hamlet of Driftwood , the home of his opponent , supports his frugal lifestyle with Veterans Administration benefits . " " I get the payments because my wife died while on active duty , " he said . " " It is n't a lavish lifestyle . You can tell my car . It 's the rattiest one on the square . " <p> Marijuana - as fiber , medicine , and recreational drug - is a cornerstone of Stefanoff 's campaign . Sheriff Hastings ' administration , he said , has " " declared war on the citizens of Hays County " by unreasonably enforcing drug laws . <p> It was a protest of local enforcement policy , a smoke-in at police headquarters , that led to his conviction on a misdemeanor drug charge and a 180-day stay in jail in 1993 . <p> While there , Stefanoff launched a hunger strike , refusing anything but water until his " " heart seized up " after 34 days . <p> " " I went into convulsions because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing wildly . So I made the decision to eat - grits , cornbread and chicken soup . A real southern meal . " <p> Stefanoff acknowledged that police should crack down on methamphetamine laboratories and major drug operations . But , he said , " " If a person is growing six or eight plants for his own use , he should be left alone . What a person does in the privacy of his own home is his business . It 's a matter of priority . Sodomy is illegal in Texas , too . But not much effort is devoted to enforcing that law . <p> " " If a person has a substance abuse problem , he should be directed to a rehabilitative program . He should n't be arrested . " <p> If elected sheriff , he said , he would concentrate on domestic violence and burglaries . <p> " " We do n't have gangs in Hays County , " he said , " " but domestic violence is a big problem . Burglaries may sound petty , but there are a lot of formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems citizens in this county are having . " <p> Montague agreed that burglaries are a major problem in the county , but he believes drug use is directly tied to those crimes . <p> " " We very often find that burglars are high on drugs when they commit these crimes , " he said . " " Or that they commit burglaries to pay for their drugs . " Montague described a county caught in a whirlwind of change . <p> The 1990 census , he said , placed county population at 65,000 . <p> But since that time , as many as 10,000 more people have moved to Hays , often building expensive homes in formerly rural areas . As many as 50,000 more people are expected to move to Austin and its neighboring communities within the next two years , he said , to work in high-tech industries . <p> Hays County , too , has been the " " drop-off point " for drug cargoes destined for larger cities , and , in recent years , drug barons have bought legitimate businesses in the San Marcos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montague formed - and for almost four years was commander of - the Hays County Drug Task Force , an organization that coordinates drug-fighting efforts of all law enforcement agencies in the county . <p> Through those efforts , 48 people were charged with felony drug offenses in the 1992-93 fiscal year . Slightly more than $ 1 million in drugs was confiscated . The next year , 100 people were charged and last year , 97 . <p> " " We have declared war on drugs , " Montague said . " " What we 're going to do is develop any leads we receive . And if that leads us to a small amount of drugs , we 're going to give that the same amount of attention that we would give it had it been a large amount . " <p> Montague noted that he also played a major role in computerizing the sheriff 's office and actively has worked to reduce crime affecting senior citizens . <p> Montague - whose family has lived in Hays County since 1865 - noted that he can best work with residents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his endorsement of Montague , agreed , expressing confidence that his chief deputy was " " capable of taking charge and moving forward in leading the department into even better days . " <p> Stefanoff countered that he , too , has been active in the community . <p> But he acknowledged that veteran deputies might take exception to his becoming the county 's top lawman . <p> " " I 'm sure I 'll lose 10 to 15 percent of the deputies , " he said . " " But I would n't lose the guards . The guards all know what type of guy I am . <p> " " After all , I was in their jail for six months . "
