To emphasize a point under discussion , E.J. Watson once shot the mustache off a man named Brewer . So testifies writer Peter Matthiessen in Killing Mister Watson , the first of three dense , fascinating novels centering on a turn-of-the-century Florida cane planter , brawler and gunman who was shot to death in 1910 by a posse of townsmen . <P> The posse 's makeup appears to have shifted over the years , with some members denying knowledge and some non-participants pinning ribbons of legend to their chest and claiming to have been among the shooters . Beyond these scraps of fact , clear sightings of old E.J. were brief . Was he an energetic , public-spirited farmer or a murderous thug who killed his field hands rather than pay them at the end of a season ? Or was he both ? <P> Watson himself does not speak in the first two novels ( the second is Lost Man 's River ) , which are told as conflicting reports by townspeople . Thus the concluding novel , Bone by Bone ( Random House ; 410 pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , appears after 900 pages of teasing preamble . Because the author has advertised his main character as a monstrous enigma , he must now provide the monster . But Watson 's villainy does n't reach heroic stature . He is a likable bully and a good shot . Most notably , he is a brutal drunk . " When I give in to that urge to drink and stir up trouble , " he admits , " there comes an even stronger urge to become drunker and behave still worse . " <P> This home truth explains a great deal that seems merely shabby , not monstrous , and not puzzling enough to require three wagonloads of explication . The author may have been right , incidentally , not to present this rough man 's thoughts in rough dialect . For long paragraphs , however , the words that come out of Watson 's mouth are , somewhat jarringly , the worthy , scholarly , perceptive , always interesting , late 20th century observations of Peter Matthiessen . About his quirky trilogy a reader might conclude : brilliant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P>  --  By John Skow
