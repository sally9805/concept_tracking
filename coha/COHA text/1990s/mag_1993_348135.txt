SINGAPORE IS ASIA 'S DREAM COUNTRY . Almost anywhere else , Goh Pang Meng , the son of a poor immigrant street vendor from China , would still be struggling to survive in a thatched hut like the one in which he grew up with 11 brothers and sisters . But at 44 , Goh owns a comfortable five-room apartment and lives , like 87% of his countrymen , in a government housing project . He has three children , the minimum politically correct number preferred for the well- educated by a eugenics-inspired government : he received a $12,500 tax credit for the third birth , and his wife , who helps out in his business , got an additional 15% annual tax cut , because she had advanced past high school . He runs a firm with 17 employees making computer screens , and rents factory space in one of the 28 government industrial parks scattered around the island republic . <P> Last year Goh won a $15,600 government grant to upgrade his factory equipment . He winced when he paid $38,000 for a small Datsun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government prevent traffic jams by limiting car ownership . " Overall , " he says , " life in Singapore is pretty good . " Sultan Ahamed , an ethnic Indian Muslim spice trader with strong family links to his strife-torn homeland , speaks for many Singaporeans when he declares , " What shall I say ? This is a paradise . " <P> In today 's global tumult , a country that enjoys full employment and stability  --  along with no crime , no pornography , no drugs , and no dirt to speak of  --  may strike many as at least a reasonable facsimile of paradise . Singapore , long an object of curiosity for its unique blend of open economics , authoritarian politics and social engineering , is attracting attention as a model modern society . Francis Fukuyama , the author of The End of History ? , says the " soft authoritarianism " of countries like Singapore " is the one potential competitor to Western liberal democracy , and its strength and legitimacy is growing daily .

The former British colony at the tip of the Malay Peninsula only achieved full independence in 1965 , yet it boasts Asia 's highest living standard after Japan , an average per capita income of $15,000 ( about the same as the U.S. ) and by far the world 's highest per capita cache of foreign reserves . <P> In contrast to other booming Asian cities that teem with noise , dirt and crowds , Singapore is orderly , regimented , well-planned  --  and rather boring . With low pollution , lush tropical greenery , a mix of modern skyscrapers and colonial-era buildings , the city resembles a clean and efficient theme park ; even the subway stations are as spotless and shiny as Disney World . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
