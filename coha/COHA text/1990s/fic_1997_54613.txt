On his way home from the Holland Park Underground Station , James Briggs had a curious sense of event in the windless , autumn evening . The house in which he lived with his wife and their one-and-a-half-year-old son was in a square , and in the garden of the square a fire was burning , the high , cracking flames illuminating the smoke as it rose up among the dark bushes and casting the shadows of these bushes through a faint mist and against the flickering housefronts . The still , misty air was filled with the scent of burning leaves . Before he went into the house , James Briggs stood on the pavement for a while and looked at the fire burning in the garden . <p> He found his wife , Diane , in the kitchen of their flat watching the baby in the highchair eat , and he kissed her and kissed the top of his son 's head . He retained that sense of event , and it seemed to him that the by now familiar scene of arriving home was somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was playing a part in the event , and he was aware of playing the part . The baby picked up food from his bowl , put it in his mouth , chewed , took the mess out , looked at it , and put it back into his mouth and swallowed . <p> I 'll watch him " James said to Diane . <p> Smiling in the quiet way she always did , even at a funny joke , she went out , and after James had wiped the baby 's hands and face and lifted him up from the highchair to bounce him in his arms so he laughed , Diane returned , her hair brushed and her blond face delicately touched with makeup . " You 'll give him hiccups , " she said . " Let me bathe him and put him to bed , " James said . <p> Bathing the baby , getting him ready for bed , sitting by him in his cot while he read him a story about a blue balloon , James thought , why did the sense of event he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ropes and stakes that was about to fly apart ? <p> At supper , Diane said , " Joanna rang today " <p> Joanna was James 's ex-wife . He had no idea what Diane 's reactions to her ringing was , because Diane , as if Joanna were a person about whom she had no right to have any thoughts or feelings , never expressed any about Joanna . <p> " How did she sound ? " James asked . <p> " Confused . " <p> James put a hand to his forehead . <p> " She did n't know what time it was , and said she thought you 'd be home . It was around noon . She did apologize . " " I had a feeling she would ring . " <p> " I 'm sorry I had to tell you , " Diane said and smiled a little . " I should have waited . " <p> " But I did already know , " James said . <p> Joanna was American . After their divorce , she had not moved back to New York from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mayfair which he had helped her move into , but where James never went to visit her . <p> All evening , he expected her to ring . <p> In the deep night the telephone rang , and Diane answered it , as she slept on that side of the bed . She said the call was for him . He did n't turn on a light to reach for the receiver , because he knew where her hand was in the dark . He heard " Hello , " and an echo , " Hello . " When James recognized the voice of Joanna 's mother in New York asking , " Is that James there ? " he answered , " Yes , " and the answer sounded as though it had come before the question . <p> " I 'm sorry , I 'm so sorry " Joanna 's mother said . " i do n't know what time it is there . " <p> James waited . <p> " James ? " <p> " Yes , Mrs. Clermont . " <p> " I 'm so sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did everything that you could do . I 've tried , too , I 've done everything I could do , but I know she ca n't he helped , as she knows , she knows she ca n't be helped . She telephoned to say goodbye , and I 'm telephoning you  --  " <p> James was n't listening to the voice , he was listening to the echo . <p> Diane switched on the lamp by the telephone on the bedside table after she hung up the receiver . James could n't recall Joanna 's telephone number , and he got out of bed for it . Diane lay with her eyes shut and the sheet drawn up to her chin . James stood by the bed and dialed and listened to the telephone on the other end of the line ring a long time . He was about to hang up and dress and rush out just when it was lifted and a voice said " Yes " without inflection . <p> " I 'm coming over now , " James said . <p> " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better open the door , or I 'll go get the police and come back with them . " <p> He did n't have enough cash for a taxi , and he thought he should n't ask Diane , but then he thought , of course he would ask her . " You 've got to lend me ten pounds , " he said . Without opening her eyes , she drew out an arm from under the sheet and pointed towards the bureau , where he found her small purse , from which he took the money . <p> He got a taxi outside the Holland Park Station . The dawn was level above the still-lit streetlamps , and there was no traffic . <p> He asked the driver to wait in the deserted Mayfair street . Through the glass doors , he saw into the illuminated foyer . The porter was not there , and the door was locked . There were rows of little metal buttons beside numbers on a metal plaque at the side of the entrance , but James could n't recall the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone number at home . He had n't . It was in his wallet with the ten pounds . Back in the taxi , he asked the driver to find a telephone box . As the driver went round the streets , James looked from right to left , thinking , I should have told her to light all the lights and walk about and not lie down or even sit . Before the taxi came to a stop , James opened the door when he saw a telephone box on a corner under a streetlamp . Now , he did n't have ten pence . His disorganization angered him : the disorganization of the world angered him . The taxi driver gave him ten pence . He dialed the number by looking carefully at each numeral in turn , and even then he thought he made mistakes ; once , his finger slipped , and he did n't know if he formed the number . Sweat broke out all over him as he waited for the ring to be answered . The air in the box smelled of cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the taxi door . He was wearing a black , baggy jacket . James wondered if ten pounds would be enough . Sweat dripped down his back , his chest , under his arms . The telephone receiver was picked up . " Give me the number of your flat , " James said . He heard breathing . <p> " Give me your flat number " James insisted . <p> " Fourteen , " Joanna said . <p> " You 'd better be ready to leave when I arrive . " <p> " Please . " <p> " At least put on shoes . " He added , " Do n't lie down . Keep walking about . And turn on all the lights . " He did n't wait for her to speak , but hung up and thrust his body against the door of the box to get out . <p> " Back to the same place ? " the driver asked . <p> Joanna let James into the foyer as soon as he buzzed . Upstairs , the door to the flat was ajar . Joanna was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one held in her hand , and she was wearing a raincoat . James knelt and put on her shoe . He stood and , taking her by an arm , started to guide her , then stopped . <p> " Do you have the keys to the flat with you ? " he asked . <p> She shook her head . In her bedroom , he found her purse . The keys were inside , and a sheaf of folded twenty-pound notes . He was not going to allow any more disorganization . He was not going to let the extravagance of the situation undo him ; he was going to fix the situation down to the little facts . He guided Joanna out to the landing and double-locked the door , then put the key into his pocket . As they went down in the lift , he told her to button her raincoat against the morning air , which she did without fumbling . She did not appear vague , but totally withdrawn . <p> The driver knew which hospital to go to . In the taxi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . James kept his eyes on her . <p> He wanted to fix what was happening onto the practicalities of dealing with it all , but , at the same time , he wanted to let it go , let what was happening billow out and , as if in a high wind , pull up the pegs of the practicalities and send the whole tent flying , allowing the acrobats , the clowns , the trainers , even the animals , the sudden freedom to do everything they 'd always wanted , which was to give up the whole fucking circus , with the excuse of the wind , the exceptional wind . <p> When Joanna closed her eyes , he said to open them . She did . <p> The taxi stopped before the casualty entrance of the hospital . James helped Joanna out , and the driver came out , too , to help , but simply looked at James walk Joanna past him . James thanked him and gave him the ten-pound note , which was almost twice as much as the fare , even with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joanna got to the hospital door , he returned , put five pounds in James 's jacket pocket , and , before leaving , said , " I 'm glad I could help . " <p> There were benches around the walls of the waiting room . James brought Joanna to one . Across the room was a couple , a man and woman , sitting silently . They looked middle-class and were middle-aged . The moment Joanna sat , the neon ceiling lights went out and the room filled with morning light . James went to look for a sister . He was not playing a part , he kept telling himself ; he was only doing what was strictly necessary , and nothing more . He made his voice expressionless when he told a sister his close friend had tried to kill herself . The sister , who seemed very tired , came with him to Joanna . She sat beside Joanna and in a notepad wrote down her name and address and age and asked her what she 'd taken , which Joanna told her with long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , antidepressants , aspirins . The sister stood and said to Joanna , " Can you follow me on your own ? " and Joanna got up , unbuttoned her raincoat , took it off , but held it by one hand as she followed the sister , dragging the coat along the floor . Before she went behind a hospital screen , the sister turned back and asked James please to wait . He watched Joanna 's raincoat being pulled around the bottom of the screen . <p> On a bench , James looked at the couple across from him , turned away from one another . <p> The neon lights came on again , then , after a flickering moment , went off again . <p> Whatever part he was playing , James knew it was a small one , and it would make no difference to anyone if he gave it up . <p> He looked at the woman 's shoes , the man 's haircut , and what he saw  --  those shoes , that haircut  --  filled him with despair . <p> The couple stood when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She walked unsteadily towards , surely , her father and mother , one hand out to touch the wall . Her face was white . She looked at the floor . A sister was behind her . <p> Her father said , " Well , you 're going to live , I see . " <p> The girl tried to smile . <p> A sister came to James and asked him if he 'd follow her behind the screen into a bare room where Joanna was sitting on a trolley , one of the straps of her nightgown fallen off a shoulder and her raincoat across her knees . Under her wild hair , her face was pale and stark . <p> " Will you be able to stay with her awhile ? " the sister asked James . <p> He nodded . <p> The sister asked Joanna to lie on the trolley , and she wheeled her out of the room . James walked alongside . They went down dim corridors , up in a lift , and along more corridors , and met no one . Then they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and through a ward , where all the beds were behind white curtains . Joanna lay with her eyes open . On the bottom shelf of the trolley was an oxygen tank ; its tube trailed on the floor . James wondered if he should offer to push the trolley . He wanted to do something . He held the doors open to another ward for the sister to push the trolley through . This ward was filled with old women in narrow beds , most of them asleep , a few sitting up . They were toothless , and their thin hair was loose about their skulls . <p> Pity twisted James 's throat , and he just managed to say , " Joanna , close your eyes , " then his throat convulsed . She closed her eyes , and her eyelids twitched . <p> In the next ward , James stood back while the sister helped Joanna stagger from the trolley onto a bed , about which the sister drew the curtains . In the other beds , women lay fiat with their eyes closed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtain . When he came out , he said to James , " She 'll have to stay a few days . " The doctor smelled of body odor . <p> The sister opened the curtain , and James went to Joanna , who , in a white hospital gown , was sitting , her back straight . She looked at James as though he was going to do something to her . He sat sideways on the very edge of the bed . Her body jumped with a sudden spasm . She pulled the thumb of one hand with her other hand , and pulled , in turn , each finger , trying , it seemed , to pull them off . She changed her hand and seemed to try to pull the thumb and the fingers off the other . Again , her body jumped . She tried to pull her hand off , her arm . Then she tried to pull her breasts from her body . <p> James did not know what he could do for her . He prayed for a great wind to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
