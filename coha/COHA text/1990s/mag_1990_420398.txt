<p> Richard Goy discusses what the history of the Serene Republic 's finest surviving medieval palace has to tell us about art , patronage and power politics among Venice 's fifteenth-century elite . <p> On August 16th , 1406 , a young Venetian nobleman named Marin Contarini was betrothed to Soradamor Zeno , daughter of another illustrious patrician casada , or clan . The arranged match was typical of the time , a product of political expediency and mutual self-interest ; it was to be sadly brief , but doubly productive - Soradamor produced three children , including the all-important son , Lunardo , but the other result of their union was the building of the Ca'd'Oro , the finest medieval palace in a city of palaces . <p> In this article , I will try and examine the reasons for building such an extravagant house , reasons which must first be sought in the political and economic climate of the time . I will also discuss the unique role that Marin played in the design of his own palace ; and lastly , I will draw one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house . <p> The Contarini played a central part at the very highest levels of political power in the Serene Republic . They had already produced many senior statesmen , including three doges ; they were not only probably the wealthiest of the 150 patrician casade that collectively ruled the Republic , but were also among the twenty- four clans that claimed to represent the only true original patriciate , known as the case vecchie or long ' families . These houses were balanced by a larger group of new ' families ( many ennobled in the thirteenth century ) , who in the early quattrocento tried to break the effective monopoly that the old ' families had so far held over the highest offices of state . Only two new ' nobles had ever been elected doge , a situation that was to be dramatically reversed once again-to Marin 's father 's personal cost - in 1423 . <p> Antonio Contarini was in fact the key figure in the early background to the building of the Ca'd'Oro . An ambitious and wealthy man , like most successful Venetian nobles he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both he and his sons dealt extensively in spices and fabrics all over the Mediterranean , and had strong links with cloth companies in Crete . Antonio made several useful political allies around the turn of the new century , and became an associate of Tommaso Mocenigo , who was elected doge in 1413 , and who ruled for a decade with some skill , an era of general peace and prosperity . <p> Antonio 's son Marin had been born in 1386 , only six years after Venice 's final victory over the ancient sea-rival , Genoa . There followed a period of recovery and reconstruction , of the re-building of merchant fleets and of commercial networks . By 1404 , when Marin came of age , much had bee ) achieved , and the Republic was once again the chief entrepot for the spice ' trade into western Europe . <p> The new century also saw a decisive shift in foreign policy ; circumstances on the Italian mainland , where Venice had traditionally played a carefully neutral role , forced the Signoria , the council of ministers , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of military campaigns , resulted in the Serenissima acquiring- for the first time ever - a large , wealthy mainland state . <p> Marin achieved maturity in precisely this period of unprecedented expansion ; by the 1420s Venice had assembled the richest mainland empire in all Italy , wealthier in resources than Milan or Florence . In a broad sense , then , the time was ideal for building symbols of confidence and prosperity . <p> While this expansion took place , Antonio Contarini advanced his own career . His choice of Doge Mocenigo as an ally was astute : only a few months after the latter 's election to the throne of San Marco , Antonio was put forward to the Maggior Consiglio ( the ruling council of hereditary patricians ) as a candidate for the Procuracy of San Marco , a position second only in protocol and prestige to the dogeship itself . Many earlier procurators had indeed achieved the ducal throne ; Antonio was still only fifty-five , and in this patrician gerontocracy that formed the res publica was quite young enough to crown his career in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Procuracy . <p> The decade of Mocenigo 's rule ( with Antonio waiting in the wings as his possible successor ) was the vital period in which the metaphorical foundations for the Ca'd'Oro were laid . The times could hardly have seemed more appropriate to embark on such a venture ; in addition to its purely practical purpose and investment value , a fine new Contarini palace would serve many purposes : most obviously , it would reflect the wealth and prestige of Antonio himself , a possible ( even a probable ) future doge . But in ever-widening circles , it would also reflect the strength of the casada as a who ; it would reinforce the image and continuing power of the case vecchie it would enhance the status of the patriciate in general ; and finally , it would add a further jewel to the crown that was the Grand Canal , the potent and already world-famous symbol of the riches of the Serene Republic , new ruler of half northern Italy . These , then , were the motives that lay behind the decisions following Marin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antonio 's instructions , Marin took the first step by renting an old Byzantine palazzo that his wife 's family owned at Santa Sofia , the next parish to his own . They lived there for five years , until 1412 , and in that year Marin bought the house outright from his wife 's elder sister and brothers-in-law . At the same time dowry was renegotiated , so that Marin paid 3,200 ducats for the house but received 2,400 from her family . <p> Antonio 's election to the Procuracy two years later again must have provided the spur to the decision to rebuild the palazzo . Although Marin 's wife lived for only three more years , the die had clearly been cast . By 1421 demolition was in hand and Marin had already begun to buy stone for his new palace . <p> On April 3rd , 1423 , Doge Mocenigo died ; his succession was to be a bitterly-fought campaign , and before his death he exhorted the Maggior Consiglio to elect Antonio Contarini or another of his close associates as his successor . But the victor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and political views . He was young and highly ambitious , and his election finally broke the virtual monopoly of the old ' families over the ducal throne . It was to be 200 years before another case vecchia regained the throne . So Antonio 's ambition was thwarted , and he was to die long before the youthful Foscari . <p> Nevertheless , by now preparatory work had begun on the new palace , and despite this serious setback , Marin had no choice but to continue . In the overall design of the Ca ' d'Oro , Contarini closely followed many aspects of a long-established tradition of palace design in the city . Like all such houses , it was to serve two functions : the home of a large , numerous branch of the patriciate , and the headquarters of their commercial empire . To the latter end , it thus had to be provided with offices , stores , servants ' quarters and an unloading bay directly onto the Grand Canal . Much of the ground floor was occupied by the traditional open hall or androne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly above it , on both upper floors , was the long axis formed by the great hall , the portego . This was the traditional hub of the domestic household , from which all of the other rooms were reached - bedrooms , kitchens and smaller living rooms . All three floors were thus to a large extent traditionally planned ; equally traditional was the open cortile to provide light and air , and in which the vital well was located . So in many ways - with the notable exception of the facade - Marin 's palace forms part of a long , slowly developed tradition . Similar palaces already lined much of the Grand Canal and could be found on most large parish squares , although they were joined by many new ones in this period . The Signoria in no way discouraged fine palaces , and tacitly encouraged any new development that would add further glory to the Grand Canal . Indeed , the only practical constraints that Marin was to encounter were the technical difficulties of the subsoil and the old foundations of the Zeno house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planning authority . Only on very rare occasions were any encroachments allowed into the public street or canal . <p> We know a great deal about the building of the palace . The State Archive contains a vital collection of Marin 's own papers , many of them detailed accounts of progress on site and in the masons ' yards . From them we can recreate most aspects of the long building process and much of the day-to-day detail of life on site . The process was to be very protracted , involving no less than four master-builders , more than thirty masons , and two or three dozen other , more specialised craftsmen . <p> Having approved the work in principle , Antonio thereafter played no direct part , and the building was in Marin 's exclusive charge . He took upon himself the role of clerk of the works , and to a large extent was his own architect as well ; the house that grew over the years had not therefore been designed in its entirety from the outset , but developed with Marin 's own ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His role was most unusual , and perhaps unique . His first master-builder , Marco d'Amadio , built only the ground floor walls before his early death , and thereafter Marin himself was largely responsible for the co-ordination of the various trades . His relationship with his senior craftsmen thus became very close over the years , particularly with the two master masons , Zane Bon and Matteo Raverti , both of whom lived only a few minutes ' walk from the site and from the Contarini house at San Felice . There are many indications of this rapport ; even before Bon had begun to work , Marin made him an interest-free loan of forty ducats to complete the purchase of his own house . Much later , when the palace was approaching completion , more than one craftsman ( including Nicolo Romanello ) actually lived in some of the completed rooms ; in the same period , Marin paid off all of Romanello 's medical bills when he fell ill . Contarini even made use of his good offices to acquire fabric for the masters ' own clothes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid the men directly himself every week if he was available , occasionally his son Lunardo deputising if he was not . <p> It is revealing to compare this extremely close , almost literally day-today relationship with that which prevailed elsewhere . Although we still know little of the details of palace building in this period , in many other fields ( such as a new church or scuola - assembly halls for the charitable institutions ) the procedure was much more regular and formalised . Increasing use was to be made in the quattrocento of a proto , or chief surveyor , who filled the role of designer and superintending architect . In some cases he was a mason by training , in others a master-builder , but he was always a professional man of considerable skill and experience . The practice of being one 's own architect never applied in such cases , and the patron usually consisted of a banca , or committee of leading figures in the establishment , who instructed the proto and to whom he was responsible . This approach became more and more widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters such as Codussi assuming the role and title of architect in much the way that we do today . <p> So Marin 's much less formal approach is somewhat late medieval ' rather than Renaissance in character , although it also directly reflects his own involvement and wishes . In most late medieval palaces , very few patricians had the time or inclination to devote so much personal effort to their houses ; had Marin had a proto ( or even a permanent master-builder ) the result would have been far less eclectic , with greater consistency of detail , but at the loss of considerable individuality and character . The individual elements that make up the facade , for example , were all designed by Bartolomeo Bon or Matteo Raverti , but Marin 's approach was phased , and we can identify these stages by examining the facade today . <p> There are also a number of records of his direct contribution to the design , notably when he borrowed ' elements that he had seen on other palaces , which he instructed his masters to use as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally led to some difficult relationships between various elements , not all resolved satisfactorily ; an example is the relationship between the large corner capitals and the miniature arcade above them , in which no convincing rapport was made . Indeed , the entire process , up to the very last balconies carved by Romanello in the 1430s ( themselves and afterthought ) was an organic ' one , a direct reflection of Marin 's own role . The result is thus a richly carved patchwork , the work of many hands , and all finally assembled together on site in 1429 to form a whole . <p> Building work had begun in earnest in 1424 , and the main fabric was largely complete by 1432 . Marin eventually took on two master builders to complete the two upper floors , and finally , in 1431 , he appointed Antonio di Martini and Zane Benzon , to whom he gave a long , detailed specification , to complete all remaining works , including paving and plastering . For much of the intervening period , from 1426 to 1429 , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facade was all being carved in Raverti 's yard . <p> Of the two master stonemasons , Raverti ( an emigre from Milan ) was responsible for the main portal at the side of the palace and the external stair in the courtyard . He also designed and carved the two beautiful logge onthe upper floors of the main facade . Raverti had several assistants , some native , some compatriots from Milan and Como , and these foreign masters made a significant contribution to the house , reflecting the importance that Venice held as the capital of a rapidly expanding empire , the attractions of which outweighed those of their native cities . <p> The two native masters were Zane Bon and his son they were responsible for the fine well-head in the courtyard , the traceried ground floor screen , and all the crowning arcading and crenellation on the facade . A significant secondary master was Nicolo Romanello , who carved a number of column capitals and most of the original balconies . <p> But the most famous feature of the palace was the final decoration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black and white colouring , the judicious use of expensive ultramarine blue and of no less than 22,000 pieces of gold leaf to highlight many of the details . Zane Da Franza ( John from France ) spent nearly two years on this work , which immediately placed the facade in a different class from that of its contemporaries . Not surprisingly , the Contarini arms was painted in blue and gold , and naturally , the palace acquired the sobriquet that it has kept to this day . <p> No other private house - as far as we know - was decorated in such a flagrantly ostentatious way ; the only other extensive facade gilding from this period seems to have been that to the Porta della Carta , at the Palazzo Ducale , to which we will return . Sadly , no authentic contemporary comments exist today , although it can only have been seen as a gesture of almost defiant wealth and display , even though it had not been pre-meditated , but only finalised while the crenellation was being fixed . So Marin 's gilding was yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general - and perhaps to Foscari and the case nuove in particular - of the continuing strength and riches of the great Contarini casada . <p> Although structurally complete by 1432 , Marin continued to add details until 1438 , when the last windows were glazed . Two years earlier , he had remarried , in his fiftieth year ; his second wife was Lucia Corner , another old ' aristocrat , and she bore him another son , Piero , in 1439 . Only months after his birth , Marin himself died , having lived in his palace for barely four years . It remained in Contarini ownership until Piero grew up , but he had only daughters to inherit his estate , and when one of them married into the Marcello family in 1518 , the house was no longer in Contarini hands and was never regained . <p> How did Marin 's masterpiece fit into its historical context , and what was its legacy ? A revealing way of assessing its influence is a direct comparison another late gothic masterpiece , Ca ' Foscari , a comparison not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been the victor of the 1423 ducal elections , and was the man whose own political triumph had denied the ducal throne to Marin 's own father . Foscari bought the site in 1452 , after a reign of nearly thirty years , and immediately began his own legacy to his family and his city . If the Ca ' d'Oro was built by a patrician with hopes of the ducal throne , then Ca ' Foscari was built by an elder statesman who had long held the highest office of state . The contrast in image ' and style is highly revealing ; Foscari had the advantage of a magnificent site , commanding an axis nearly a kilometer long , terminating at the Rialto Bridge . The site demanded a palace of great presence and that was what he built : a noble . confident pile , perfectly symmetrical and of great grandeur . There is no lighthearted crenellation here , nor was there any ostentatious gilding . Foscari 's was the palace of a prince , who felt no need to incorporate such stylistic excesses to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three decades . <p> Both houses , though , mark the penultimate stage in the unique style that was Venetian gothic ; although Ca ' Foscari had many progeny in the 1450s , 1460s and even 1470s , the Ca ' d'Oro only had one . That was the Porta della Carta , built in the 1 440s and largely the work of the same Bartolomeo Bon who had made important contributions to Marin 's palace . Stylistically , the Porta marks the last , richest flowering of the flamboyant vernacular in which architecture and sculpture are fully integrated . But the significance of our example lies in what we are comparing : on one hand the private house of only one of dozens of patrician families , and on the other no less than the state entrance to the seat of government of the Serenissima itself . Marin 's eclectic masterpiece was thus exceeded in richness by just this one work in the capital over the next half century ; all of the other houses took Ca ' Foscari ( and its antecedents ) as their more sober model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d'Oro was not profound . Towards the end of the century , the Renaissance finally reached the lagoons , and by the early 1500s , the work of Codussi and other foreign masters brought their new classicism to the capital . Once the break had finally been made , the gothic style became more and more old-fashioned ; neither de ' Barbari nor Marin Sanudo singled the palace out for special attention or praise , and with the monumental works of Michele Sanmicheli and Jacopo Sansovino as his own models , the latter 's son Francesco ( writing in the 1580s ) dismissed almost every one of the medieval palaces as being simply in the German style ' , and hence archaic . Despite the fact that they were all quintessentially Venetian , they were already of only antiquarian interest - the way we used to build ' . Even the Palazzo Ducale was much more highly-regarded for its civic and political role than its unique contribution to the Venetians ' own architectural heritage . <p> So Marin 's legacy was brief . The house itself slowly declined after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nineteenth century was its importance re-assessed . Partly restored by Baron Franchetti in the early 1900s , the house has only returned to a semblance of its original appearance since the restorations of the 1980s . <p> The Ca ' d'Oro thus remains unique ( despite the vicissitudes of the centuries ) as one man 's attempt to make his mark on the city in a highly individual , eclectic manner ; in it we see fused together the enlightened enthusiasm of a patrician architect manque and the skills of a remarkable group of masons , sculptors and builders . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : The Ca'd'Oro today and ( below ) a view across the canal seen through its distinctive treceried ground floor screen . <p> PHOTOS ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : A view of 15th-century Venice by the engraver Breydenbach ; ( below ) Bellini 's portrait of Tommaso Mocenigo , elected doge of the city in 1413 and the friend and patron of Antonio Contarini , creator of the Ca ' d'Oro . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The Miracle of the True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that emphasises the confraternities which tied in religious observance with social status for the patriciate the city . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Ca ' Foscari-eponymous creation of Doge Francesco , whose accession denied the Contarini family supreme office and whose construction , while Venetian Gothic like the Ca ' d'Oro , Ca'd'Oro , is the expression of confident success rather than fevered aspiration . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : A Venetian stonemason , as seen on a capital of of the Doge 's palace . <p> PHOTOS ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : ( Below ) Rosso 's balcony and Raven Raverti 's courtyard and staircase the Ca , ' d'Oro . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : The Porta della Carta  --  showing Doge Foscari with the winged lion of St Mark .

Noses are modified and breasts are reshaped to correct perceived flaws , but most procedures are aimed at making us look younger . Liposuction and tummy tucks remove the fat that accumulates with age and childbirth ; face-lifts and poisonous Botox injections paralyze and stretch wrinkled skin smooth . What a person hopes to see in the mirror reflects what his or her society values most , in our case , youth . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their bodies . They invested vast amounts of wealth -- and endured unspeakable pain -- to make themselves beautiful . Through their artwork and the study of their physical remains we can begin to understand what motivated their search for physical perfection . What did ancient Maya men and women hope to see when they looked in their pyrite mirrors ? <p> Perhaps the men wanted to look like K'inich Janaab ' Pakal ( Pakal the Great ) , who ruled the city of Palenque in northern Chiapas , Mexico , from A.D. 612 until his death in 683 . Few ancient Maya remains have been as thoroughly studied as Pakal 's . His tomb within Palenque 's Temple of the Inscriptions provides a clear view of the standard of beauty to which ancient Maya men aspired . A stucco head wedged under his sarcophagus and a mosaic jade mask on his face convey idealized notions of his appearance . But what did he look like in real life ? <p> From my first visit to Palenque in 1975 , and throughout my nearly 30-year career as a Mesoamerican art historian , I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reckoned with and then built his own great funerary pyramid , a ruler whose descendants worshiped him as a deity . <p> Pakal 's bones and teeth were recently restudied by Vera Tiesler and Andrea Cucina of the Autonomous University of Yucatan , and they can now tell us more about his physical appearance . First , Pakal was taller than most ancient Maya men , standing just over five feet four inches . And unlike most people of his day , his bones display no signs of disease or malnutrition . Pakal received the typical cranial modification for someone born into an elite family . Shortly after birth , while his skull was still soft and growing , his mother applied a binding device to his forehead so that his cranium grew into a long , tapered form , smartly indented above the brow line . <p> As a king , Pakal was expected to personify several important deities . In stone carvings , his clothing and adornments reflect associations with the gods of rain and lightning , but his body was shaped to resemble the Sun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bead between his eyes when he was a baby so that he would become permanently cross-eyed , a trait associated with the Sun God . <p> The Maya believed that because they had to squint to look at the sun , the Sun God also squinted back at them . Crossed eyes would have given Pakal the appearance of squinting . Also like the Sun God , he had filed teeth in the shape of the letter " T , " which accentuated his squinting expression by drawing attention to the center of his face . At the time of his death , Pakal had lost two molars and periodontal disease may have given him some pain , but the 24 teeth in his mouth had not a single cavity . <p> The earliest image of Pakal , a profile carving on an oval tablet found in his royal palace , emphasizes his flattened forehead . His simply rendered body reveals a slim physique . Pakal also had luxuriant hair , which he wore in thick , layered tresses trimmed to blunt ends in the front and tied in the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves at the top of a healthy maize plant . Because each kernel on a cob requires a strand of silk to be pollinated , abundant corn silk pointed to a healthy cob of maize -- and Pakal 's hair indicated his maize-like perfection . <p> Images of him suggest he wore a nosepiece to extend the long , tapering line of his nose into his forehead . How the nosepiece was worn is not known , but it seems to have been a fashion among the Maya . Images of defeated captives depict them with prominent foreheads and round or snub noses , while the victorious lords are shown with the bridge of their noses meeting their foreheads in an unbroken line that sometimes extended all the way to their hair . <p> ACCORDING TO THE POPOL Vuh , the creation story of the K'iche Maya , creator gods formed human beings out of masa , the same maize dough the Maya still use to make tortillas and tamales . The typical maize plant yields one healthy ear ; others ripen only as nubbins or succumb to the maize fungus , Ustilago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself with dwarves and hunchbacks , symbolizing imperfect ears of maize -- embodiments of the ugly and deformed . Maya rulers also associated with dwarves and hunchbacks . <p> The Maize God lived for only a single season -- growing and ripening , then harvested and planted once again as a tiny kernel in an eternal cycle of death and rebirth . Although Pakal surely grew wrinkled in old age , depictions of him and most Maya elites always retain a youthful appearance . <p> On the surface of Pakal 's vast sarcophagus , he is shown with his hair styled like the Maize God and a burning torch protruding from his forehead like K'awiil , a lightning deity worshiped by Palenque 's royalty . Once they laid the dead king within the sarcophagus , his attendants placed a mask bearing the Maize God 's features made of small jade tesserae , like individual maize kernels , onto his face , giving him the appearance of eternal youth even in death . In this sense he was planted like a maize kernel at the base of the Temple of Inscriptions . Pakal both lived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEAUTY based on the Maize God applied to women as well as men . Pakal , for example , is shown on the lid of his sarcophagus wearing the Maize God 's jade skirt . It is the same skirt his mother is shown wearing on an oval tablet from the royal palace at Palenque . Women 's skulls were also bound into elongated shapes , and they filed their teeth or drilled holes in them to hold inlays of jade , pyrite , hematite , or turquoise . Another fashion that men and women shared was painting their bodies with abstract designs . <p> In one of the extraordinary murals at Bonampak in southeastern Chiapas , a servant daubs paint on a royal dancer . Males glisten with red from the neck down , while women have red paint only on their faces . The complementary patterns appear to be one of many localized fashions in body painting that extended across the Maya world and that involved a variety of colors and designs . When Pakal 's body was prepared in an elaborate embalming process , his skin was treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which were concentrated on his trunk . As Tiesler and Cucina have determined , the red paint consisted largely of the toxic mineral cinnabar , or vermilion , with a little hematite and iron ore in the mix . <p> Blue-green was considered the most beautiful pigment , perhaps because it was associated with jade , the most valuable material of ancient Mesoamerica . Blue shades ( see " Sacred Maya Blue " ) were associated with sky and water , while green hues symbolized the maize plant , not only as the source of sustenance but also as the sacred material from which humans were formed . Unlike almost all else in the tropical rain forest , jade was permanent and thus made the ideal funerary offering . It evoked the Maize God , permanence , and the essence of beauty . Reduced even to a single bead , jade could germinate and yield the tender maize once again , the Maya believed . <p> BEAUTY WAS ENHANCED BY piling On elaborate jade jewelry or by wearing fashionable clothing . Paintings at both Bonampak and Calakmul , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirm women 's interest in fashion . Those of high status wore gauzy cotton dresses over contrasting underskirts , brocaded dresses cinched at the waist , and patterned shifts and blouses draped over wrapped skirts . By about A.D. 700 , women gained political and economic power , and this may have been reflected in their clothing . Two of the most prominent ancient Maya women , the queen of Yaxchiln , Lady Xook , and the queen of Piedras Negras , Lady K'atun Ajaw , favored stunning woven patterns in their clothing . The stone carvings commissioned by Lady Xook for her building on the site 's main plaza show her wearing three different outfits in a conspicuous display of her taste in fashion . Beaded dots of face paint or scarification are similar to other artistic representations that symbolize elegant speech or song . <p> Both queens were somewhat hefty , a testament to their wealth and status . Most elites ate a refined diet , as their teeth reveal , including cacao , or kakaw , as the Maya called it . Cacao beans served as ancient Mesoamerica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating money itself . Chocolate was one of the rare Maya foods rich in fat , so fat signaled wealth and power , if not beauty itself . <p> IMAGES OF BEAUTY also provided moral lessons for the Maya . Stylized funerary figurines from the island of Jaina , off the Yucatan Peninsula , show two typical examples of female beauty . One , probably a young Moon Goddess , emphasizes a voluptuous , youthful figure/often bare-breasted . Her upper body and hair are usually highlighted with brilliant touches of blue pigment . Her hair is parted and twisted into a headdress of cotton cords , indicating her role as a patron of weaving ; her face is highlighted with pigment or tattooing , usually in a dotted pattern near the mouth . <p> Young and beautiful , the Moon Goddess frequently accepts the embrace of a companion . In some cases it is an anthropomorphic rabbit who was thought to live in the moon , but often the companion is a creator god depicted as an old man , whose collapsed toothless face is , like hunchbacks and dwarves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen lifting her skirt or touching her breast . Here the Maya artist seems to draw attention to the woman 's wayward behavior , perhaps as a moral commentary . <p> The second type of female figurine is more enigmatic . She wears a draped blouse over a wrapped skirt , and in many cases a heavy necklace that required a counterweight down her back . The front of her face is framed by sharply trimmed bangs . She sports a large lock of hair pulled forward and threaded through a bead , hanging over her bangs . Her face is sometimes marked with prominent striations representing scars or tattoos extending from her lip line almost to her ears . She works at her loom , prepares food , or sits modestly with hands on the knees of her crossed legs . She is a paragon of industry and probably virtue , since she is never seen cavorting with old gods or the odd mammal . <p> BEAUTY WAS A WAY to display social , if not moral , value among the ancient Maya . The wealth they invested and pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make our modern-day obsession with beauty seem less excessive . Like us , the Maya indulged in self-deception about appearance , preferring to let artistic depictions conform to their ideals rather than reality . Although hearty and robust for an old man of 80 , Pakal 's depiction never aged ; he remained a youthful Maize God , just on the cusp of maturity . The Maya saw what the Maya wanted to see when they looked into their pyrite mirrors : green and blue jewels , perhaps a few daubs of red paint , and the youthful vigor of agricultural fertility . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : An ancient Maya ruler checks his reflection in a pyrite mirror while an attendant applies red paint to his backside .
