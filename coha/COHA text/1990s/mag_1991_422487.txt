In the past three years rising federal and local taxes have begun to cancel out the tax cuts of the Reagan years . This is bad news for political incumbents and equally bad news for the U.S. economy . <p> AMERICANS FACE A long year of electoral econobabble . If that is n't pain enough , they also face a pretty weak economy . FORBES offers the following chart portfolio in the belief that a picture is worth a thousand words  --  and a million numbers . <p> FORBES ' charts focus not on nebulous aggregates but on the experience of individual American taxpayers . And they place this experience in perspective  --  over time , against trend and , where appropriate , as a share of the total economy . <p> The overall conclusion of these charts is disturbing . A decade ago American taxpayers faced crisis . It was staved off . Now it seems to be returning . For most taxpayers , the Bush era has been the equivalent of the Ford and early Carter years . Is this where we came in ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with it . See page 89 . ) <p> In recent weeks Washington has been wittering about a relatively obscure economic statistic : inflation-adjusted disposable income per capita . This message about conditions out there in the boondocks has penetrated the Beltway consciousness because of the realization that , since World War II , no party has retained the White House if in the election year per capita real disposable income has failed to grow by at least 2.9% . <p> Per capita disposable income has actually been falling recently . And the consensus of leading forecasters assembled by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators service suggests growth in 1992 will be not more than about 2.4% . Bad news for incumbents . <p> FORBES ' chart reveals the full extent to which the individual American has been Bushwhacked  --  or , to be strictly accurate , whacked during George Bush 's presidency but not necessarily by Bush . By the end of the Reagan years , income growth was closely tracking its long-term annual compound growth rate of 2% . But since then it has fallen steadily away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Bush men hit their magic number in 1992 , per capita disposable income will still be distinctly below trend . Americans may just be able to say they are better off than four years earlier . But they will be less better off than they might have anticipated . <p> Real disposable income is affected by recession , as people lose their jobs , by interest rate changes and other factors , including direct taxes . And there are clear signs that in the Bush years all these have started back up , federally and on the state and local level . Thus the increased social insurance contributions imposed on high-income earners by the 1990 federal budget compromise helped to reduce total disposable income by about 0.3% in 1991 . <p> The marginal rate of income tax ( above ) is that charged on the next dollar earned . It is what the taxpayer must think about when deciding whether to work more or go fishing . <p> ( Note carefully : Usually , the marginal rate is not the same as the average rate  --  the overall proportion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These rates can be the same only in a flat-rate system . ) <p> The Reagan Administration cut marginal tax rates , but FORBES ' chart reveals that this only reversed the very sharp unlegislated increases of the 1970s . Runaway inflation meant that , as incomes were raised in nominal terms to retain purchasing power , they ran slap into higher tax brackets  --  bracket creep . ' This did not happen in countries where income taxes were indexed for inflation , like Canada ( then ) . <p> American families earning twice the median income of approximately $41,000 now face a 28% marginal rate  --  about the same as the early 1970s , and considered too high even by the Democratic architects of the 1964 Kennedy tax cut . Median income and half median income families have had the beneficial effects of the 1970s better than rolled back . ( But remember that within living memory their tax rates were much lower : Half the median income families made it onto the rolls only in 1960 , and the income tax bill of a median income family of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just $80 . ) <p> Families at the 95th percentile ( $100,000 ) are back to the mid-1970s , not least because of the 1990 rate increase . <p> Contrary to myth , the Reagan tax cuts did not produce a collapse in individual federal income tax revenues ( see chart above ) . These continued in excess of 8% of gross national product , consistently above the post-World War II range , although below the bracket-creep peak of the early 1980s , the highest since 1944 . <p> ( Note the surge of receipts during WWII . Only at this point did most American families first make the acquaintance of the federal income tax . ) <p> Two factors explain why receipts held up so well when Reagan was cutting marginal rates so sharply . <p> First : To some extent , the cuts did pay for themselves , just as the more enthusiastic supply-siders predicted . The top 5% of income earners , already contributing 37.5% of income tax receipts in 1977 , were even inspired by the lower rates to increase their share an estimated 44.1% in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1981 reduced pretax deductions , increasing taxable income  --  broadening the tax base . ' Marginal rate charts do n't capture this . <p> The Administration now projects income tax receipts will rise to 9% by 1995 , canceling out the reduction of the Reagan years . <p> The Social Security levy ( above ) is sometimes portrayed as a sort of insurance payment . But in fact it is immediately disbursed to the present generation of recipients . It should be considered as a second , parallel federal income tax . Unlike the income tax , Social Security in 1990 is a flat 7.65% levy on all incomes up to $51,300 . <p> FORBES ' chart shows that this substantially increases the marginal rates faced by all except higher-income families , which have already paid their $3,925 maximum ( until the 1990 budget compromise , which extended the 1.45% Medicare levy to incomes up to $125,000 ) . <p> Also unlike the federal income tax , those paying Social Security acquire a statutory right to be reimbursed at an appropriate future point . Arguably , the present value of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since low-income earners stand to gain more than they are now paying , this would make the system appear more progressive . But FORBES ignores this refinement as a bit too arcane for these purposes . <p> The tax code is a mess , ' says Stephen Entin of the Washington , D.C.-based Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation . Notwithstanding the Reagan reforms , many people still face historically high marginal rates . ' And Entin points out that the interaction between the Social Security system and income tax has resulted in many anomalies , such as punitive effective marginal rates on the working elderly and those trying to get off welfare . <p> In its blind , groping , monstrous way , ' says Entin in a tone of clinical interest , the federal government seems to be subconsciously working toward a flat tax in the 30%-to-40% range . ' <p> Experience suggests this is about the highest rate taxpayers will stand still for . After World War II and Korea , U.S. marginal rates ranged up to 91% on extremely high incomes , but these top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennedy proposed his tax cuts , the 20% bracket was yielding a monstrous 85% of income tax receipts . All the brackets above 50% yielded only 2% . In 1960 income in the 91% bracket was reported by a mere 205 taxpayers . Excessively high taxes simply generate tax shelters and discourage productive investment . <p> FORBES ' capital gains chart ( opposite ) records another attempt to extract revenue from wealthier taxpayers . Arguably , a capital gains levy is double taxation , since it falls on the fruits of retained ( and previously taxed ) earnings . As with income tax , the top marginal capital gains rate has returned to the relatively high levels seen in the 1970s . And unlike income tax , capital gains tax is not indexed for inflation . In effect , it expropriates savings . In another sense it is simply a transaction tax , because it comes due only if the property is sold . <p> If the federal government subconsciously intends to extract the maximum revenues from taxpayers , it is going to have to compete with the equally monstrous groping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending has risen from 9.7% of GNP in 1960 to above 14% this year . Someone has to pay for it . <p> FORBES ' charts reflect the combined marginal impact on $100,000 taxable income families in California and New York City . Both benefited from trimming of marginal rates in the 1980s , echoing the federal reforms . But now both are on their way back up . And remember , most state and local taxes , being indirect , do n't show up on these charts . California Governor Pete Wilson 's 1991 tax hike aimed to raise $7 billion , of which only $1.2 billion came from personal income tax ( including an 11% top marginal rate on incomes over $200,000 , also not shown ) . <p> Result : Both California and New York City now have top marginal rates in excess of welfare-state Britain , which charges a maximum of only 40% on individual incomes above o20,700 ( $35,000 ) . <p> Do n't tax you , do n't tax me , tax the fellow behind the tree . ' This celebrated summary of the politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tree is already being taxed . So is everyone else . Most Americans face tax rates that are relatively high in the national experience . <p> This is the inexorable consequence of combined federal , state and local government spending now running at 32.7% of GNP in 1990 ( virtually its postwar high ) . This amount of money simply can not be raised without taxing the great bulk of the population . As Willie Sutton said about robbing banks : That 's where the money is . Even if all incomes over $100,000 could be confiscated  --  which even the most dogmatic anti-supply-sider must admit would have a terminally disincentive effect  --  they would still amount to only about 8% of GNP . <p> Politically , these charts suggest that by historical standards tax rebellion is very close . Economically , they suggest the economy may be headed for the stagnation of the late 1970s . <p> GRAPH : Per capita income drops below trend  --  Even a strong election year rebound wo n't repair the damage . ( Andy Christie/Forbes ) <p> GRAPHS : Marginal tax rates mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only offset increases in the 1970s . Income tax revenues remained at historic highs . Now both are rising again . <p> GRAPH : Social Security levy boosts marginal rates  --  Adjusting for Social Security payments sharply increases marginal income tax rates  --  since 1990 , even on higher incomes . <p> GRAPHS : The cost of success in California ... and in New York  --  Marginal tax rates on upper income families in California and New York City are far above levels of a generation ago . <p> By Peter Brimelow <p>
