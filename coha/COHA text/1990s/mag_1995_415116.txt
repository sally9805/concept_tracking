We do not suffer fools gladly in old age , " the potter Ken Ferguson said to me , on a bright afternoon in May . Sitting in the ceramics studio at the Kansas City Art Institute , where he has taught and been head of the department since 1964 , Ferguson was characteristically direct but in all expansive mood , and with good reason . Kansas City was celebrating his 36-year career and contribution as outstanding artist and teacher with two major exhibitions : a retrospective of his work at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art ( March 18-May 31 ) and " Keepers of the Flame : Ken Ferguson 's Circle " at the Art Institute 's handsome new Kemper Museum of Contemporary Art and Design ( March 18-May 21 ) . ( 1 ) This show featured the work of 16 of Ferguson 's former students who have gained recognition in the field with that of Ferguson and two fellow teachers at KCAI , Victor Babu and George Timock . Now 67 years old , Ferguson , it is probably safe to say , has never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a 1980 interview published in the catalogue of a traveling exhibition , Ferguson , asked whether he considered himself a contemporary potter , replied , " I do n't care how contemporary I am . All this other business does n't matter . I know what I am and if they my italics ca n't figure it out or do n't want to know the truth , then it 's their problem . " He also defined himself as a potter , pure and simple . " I 'm certainly not making sculpture . " ( 2 ) Now , speaking of his exhibition at the Nelson-Atkins , Ferguson said , " I am honored and flattered . It is rare for a museum to give a retrospective to a potter . We 're the underdogs , the bottom of the totem pole . I wondered , what are they going to take ? The guest curator , Edward Lebow , dug into closets . I was elated when I saw the show . Here are my old friends . What a great feeling . " One of the earliest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collection of the Museum of Ceramic Art at Alfred University , where Ferguson received his M.F.A. It is a piece informed by what I think of as the classic Alfred aesthetic , one based in Oriental ceramics . Any functional potter today would be proud to have produced it . The latest works , from 1994 , include a basket form , its handle an arching hare whose taut leap from rim to rim stretches the basket into an elliptical shape , and Triple Udder Pouring Vessel with Mermaid Handle , a tripodal pot . The title pretty much describes this piece and its sexual content , but the androgynous addition of one of Ferguson 's failing , if phallic , scrotal spouts ( which first showed up on his teapots in the early 80s ) , the ferocious face of the mermaid and the dark , burnt-looking , crackled glaze that curdles at the neck add a very funny note of rueful misogyny . Tripodal pots appear in many ancient ceramic traditions , and by chance I found what could be this pot 's ancestor in the book The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Lung-shan culture ( third or second millennium B.C. ) , which even has a twisted handle similar to Ferguson 's mermaid handle . I bring this up not only to emphasize Ferguson 's strong roots in ceramic tradition , his vast knowledge and , more important , understanding of ceramic history , but to point out that both pots incorporate figurative elements into a unified whole , a pot that keeps its form and its recognition of function . The wisely chosen objects in the exhibition perfectly illustrate Ferguson 's essentially conservative development from functional ware to his most recent work , which is narrative , personal , even self-referential . Physicality and vigor have always characterized Ferguson 's pots . His 1970s teapots and baskets , with their sensuous , juicy glazes , managed to retain through the high firing a spontaneous , fresh-from-the-wheel quality . In the pots from the early 80s , the scale suddenly is enlarged beyond the purely utilitarian . Ferguson 's " slump " jars , inspired in part by the ceramics of Peter Voulkos , speak of the tension of the clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle through sheer weight and wetness . The clay gets " tired . " The handles , stretching up from the lips of teapots and baskets , meet in the tense grip of a handshake . Spouts wrinkle and sag . The pots become a comment on the human condition , the frailty of mere flesh , the effect of gravity on clay and human body alike . Ferguson attributes his breakthrough in the 80s to Barbara Okun , who exhibited his work at the Okun-Thomas Gallery in St. Louis in 1980 . " She thought my work was terrific , " Ferguson said . " She gave me confidence . You have to believe in yourself to charge $500 for a bowl . My scale changed . I stopped making functional pottery , but it was years after Voulkos stopped . " For more than a decade , Ferguson 's platters , too heavy for serious utility , have carried freely drawn line images cut into the clay . Among his preferred motifs have been the hare and Adam and Eve , which can be found decorating English slipware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The retrospective includes Ferguson 's first use of the hare image , in 1983 , on an elegant porcelain platter with a few discreet splats of green glaze . On another platter of the same year , Ferguson 's Adam and Eve , based on a drypoint by Max Beckmann , are a disenchanted couple playing with themselves . By 1992 the hare on a roughly oval platter cavorts on the crazed , rough surface of a slip glaze , and the splats have turned an ominous brown . Another recurring image , the mermaid , which appears on a 1985 platter inscribed with the lines " I have heard the mermaids singing each to each . / I do not think that they will sing for me " from T. S. Eliot 's " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock , " has become the sea hag of Ferguson 's latest work . " I do not make cute pots , " Ferguson said . " I really got the image from the hood ornament on a 1937 Pontiac . " Turtles and foxes are also incorporated in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fossil-like glazes , but much has been made of the hare image by , among others , Lebow , in his essay in the accompanying catalogue . The quick hare has been compared to Ferguson 's early utilitarian work , where production and sheer volume were important , the tortoise to the carefully organized , less spontaneous later work that involves drawings and the placement of sculptural parts . Since I was brought up by a southern father who read Uncle Remus aloud in the original version , complete with dialect , Brer Rabbit was my first trickster rabbit long before Bugs Bunny . Both match their wiles and win against more powerful opponents , though in the long run , according to Aesop , it is the tortoise who beats the overconfident , flamboyant rabbit . However , the rabbit and Ferguson share an unself-conscious spirit of irreverence and bawdiness . Ferguson , consistently evasive on questions of symbolism , says only that he chose the hare because of its ears , its leaping linearity . My favorite is the formal Tripod Hare Teapot , 1990 , with its rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that form the sculptural legs . Its shape and the patina of its black encrusted surface recall ancient bronzes , no doubt intentionally . Ferguson mentioned the sixth- and seventh-century Hunan bronzes he saw on a trip to China and Japan in 1973 . Looking at the change and growth in Ferguson 's work over the years , from the highly facile utilitarian pots of his early years to the strongly individualized pieces with their sculptural additions of the last decade , I thought about his generation of potters , those who came to prominence in the late 50s . With no loss of energy some , like Warren MacKenzie or Toshiko Takaezu , have not strayed far from their original aesthetic . ( Reviewing a recent Takaezu exhibition , I had to double-check dates on pieces . ) Several other notable potters of the 50s , unfortunately , are simply repeating themselves in what often amount to parodies of their original work . " You 've got to be good as a potter to make good pots , " Ferguson said . " But you have to have intellectual curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to listen and ask , why do n't you do this ? " Another side of Ferguson is his teaching . " I love teaching , " he said . " It 's positive . It energizes me . You develop relationships . There 's a sharing . Next year might be my last . I enjoy it so much , the idea of leaving is most painful to me . It is fortuitous to be in Kansas City , to me the best pottery teaching place in the country . The Nelson next door has one of the great ceramic collections  --  Oriental pots , English slipware . It confers credibility on ceramics . After class my students and I can go to the Nelson , have lunch , and I can show them examples of what I 'm talking about . " Ferguson 's power as a teacher was evident in the exhibition of his former students ' work at the Kemper . If they have all been subjected to Ferguson 's insistence on a strong , basic understanding of the medium , there are no Ferguson clones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was represented by his shattered , deconstructed teacups and John Balistreri , the most recent ( 1986 ) , by an impressive installation of a long row of sculptural headstones , each one treated differently . Both Allan Winkler and Arnold Zimmerman showed sculptural pieces , but the vessel in its many manifestations , from David Nelson 's classic porcelain bowl to Akio Takamori 's contorted , erotic human figures , inspired by Japanese prints , predominated . ( These artists , along with Andrea Gill , John Gill , Kurt Weiser , Richard Notkin , Chris Gustin and Chris Staley , also in the Kemper show , were heavily represented among the younger generation in the 1986 exhibition " American Potters Today " at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London , ample testimony to the quality of ceramics teaching at the Kansas City Art Institute . ) When I asked why there seems to be such a lack of new energy in the ceramics field today  --  creative strength seems to be in other media  --  Ferguson agreed with me that there was , but said that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personally believe it has something to do with the long process of study in ceramics , its ancient traditions . It is a craft , and the best work seems to come after years of exploration and hard work . We live in an age of flash , of immediate gratification , when such a painstaking approach is not encouraged . Then , when I asked Ferguson if his latest work , his choice of imagery with rather specific connotations , was motivated by the same outlook that informed Picasso 's great outpouring of drawings on the artist and the model  --  funny , erotic , rueful  --  that he completed the year he turned 70 , Ferguson challenged me . If he never answered me directly , he said , " What do you think ? This is the work , this is the subject matter I am doing at this time in my life . " 1 .
