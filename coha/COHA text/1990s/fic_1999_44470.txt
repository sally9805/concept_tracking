Lucy Sussex lives in Brunswick , Australia . She has edited several anthologies for readers young and old , including The Patternmaker and She 's Fantastical . Her own award-winning short fiction has appeared in anthologies and magazines like Eidolon , The Horns of Elfland , Alien Shores , and The Women Who Walk Through Fire . Her novels include Deersnake and The Scarlet Rider . By way of background for this sf story , she notes that Erewhon is not just the Victorian dystopia created by Samuel Butler . It 's also the name of the sheep ranch Mr. Butler owned in the alpine area of New Zealand . Ms. Sussex spent summers there in her youth and greatly preferred the ranch to the novel . <p> " HEY YOU ! STORY-EATER ! Devourer of lives ! Leave us alone ! GET OUT ! " Those are the first sounds on the tape : Idris spitting at me , refusing to be interviewed . I wind on a little , until I hear a different voice - Sadry speaking . Sadry : ... ghosts . The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone knew , for there was only our family of three and the hired hands rattling around the building . Erewhon had followed the Rule for generations , not that I knew that . I was only a child , I think three . Things had n't got explained to me yet . I had no idea how odd my upbringing was , for the High country , with only one father . One night I thought I heard crying , so I got out of bed , curious . I wandered along the upstairs corridor which all the sleeping rooms led off . When I got a little older , I learnt why this space was called " Intrigue , " in all the Rule houses . It kinks and curves , with crannies for people to hide and overhear  --  hence the name . Me : A public space ? Sadry : Or a private one . I followed the sound to the outside wall , to a window with a recessed ledge . The shutters were closed and the winter curtains drawn , but between both was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the sound came . Now it sounded human , and female . I heard soft words , a male voice responding . Two people were hidden there ! And curious , I stood and listened . But it was bitter frost weather , and rather than give myself away by teeth-chatter , I retreated until just round the corner I found a basket . It was filled with rags , either bought from Scavengers or our old clothes ( Highlanders never throw anything away ) . So I climbed into it without making a sound , for it was an old Tech thing , of perlastic , rather than wicker . I curled up warmly in the contents and listened in comfort , not that I could understand much . Eventually I fell asleep , and woke in dawnlight to find my mother bending over me . And unthinkingly I blurted out the last words I had heard , which were : " I only want to be married to the one I love best , not all the others . " My mother said : " Where did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledge . " The two lovers , there , last night . " She looked at me hard , then flung the curtain back . It was n't me who screeched , it was her - at the sight of dust thick and undisturbed on the ledge . Then she scooped me up in her arms and went running down Intrigue , to the room she and my father shared , a small room , his younger son 's room . Idris : What did he do ? Sadry : Took us both into bed , calmed us down , for now I was hysterical too , and then very gently questioned me . What did the voices sound like ? Could I imitate them ? When I was as dry of information as a squeezed fruit , he said : " It could have been any unhappy Queen of Erewhon . " And then he told me about living under the Rule , of his first wife , his brother , and their husband-lover . Polyandry . The first time I heard the word I thought it a girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrected , stuck in my mind , so that I persistently thought of the woman at the center of these group marriages as a Polly . And here I was in Polyandry Central , as anthropologists called it , the Highlands of Suff , and I still could n't shake my personal terminology . It was a bad slip to make when trying to convince Bel Innkeeper to find me space , in a town already filled to bursting for the Assizes . " We call them Queens , " she said . I 'd listened to tapes of Suff accents but the actuality was something else , my comprehension of it being delayed , with embarrassing pauses at the ends of sentences . When I finally understood , I replied , too hastily : " I know . Like bees . " All the while we had talked on the inn 's back verandah , a steady stream of fat brown bees had zoomed to and from some nearby hive , so this comment was both dead obvious and instantly regrettable . Bel snorted . " You Northerners ! Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a hive , ever seen a Rule House ? No , that 's why you 're here , to find all about the funny Suffeners , is n't it ? " I said , carefully : " Okay , I 'm what you call a story-eater , an anthropologist . But I can understand you 've had a gutful of being studied and written up . I 'm not here to sensationalize you , but to observe the court case . " Bel stopped folding the inn washing and gave me her undivided attention . " Why ? " " Because it 's important . " " It 's brought everyone down from the mountains and into this valley ! How 'm I supposed to house " em all ? And you , too . " She rocked on the balls of her feet , thinking . " Well , since you 're here , I 'd better be hospitable . And teach you about queen bees , too . " She pointed at an outbuilding . " That 's the honey-hut , and the one free space I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hut was tiny : between pallet and beekeeping equipment there was barely any room for me . Above the bed was what I at first took to be a Tech photoimage , but it proved to be a window looking onto the mountains , made of the glass and wooden surround of a picture frame . In fact the whole building was constructed of scavenged oddments from the days of affluence : flattened tins , scraps of timber , and other usables slapped together in a crude but habitable mess . I was used to recycling , even in the neo-industrial North , but I had never seen such a higgledypiggledy assortment before . It was to prove typical of much of the town itself . I lay on the pallet and dozed for a while , lulled by the soporific hum from the nearby hives . When I woke , I tested my tape recorder - a precious thing , not because it was a genuine Tech artifact , but because it was a copy , its workings painstakingly rediscovered . Of course , it was n't as good ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor as spendthrift , as our forebears . For over a century now , since the Crash , we had been adapting to an economy of scarcity . It was the adaptations , rather than the antiques , or the neo-copies , that interested me - particularly the Rule Houses , and at their center , the Queen Polly Andree . How would it feel , to have multiple husbands ? And what would happen if you grew tired of them ? SADRY : My father said , " Nobody knows how the Rule began , just as nobody knows who bred the mountain Lori to be our herd animals . A Northerner , a story-eater , once told me the Rule was a pragmatic evolution , practiced by other mountain peoples . He said large populations can not be sustained in marginal highland . One wife for several men - who are linked by blood , or ties of love - limits breeding , and means the family land can be passed undivided through the generations . It made sense ; more than what the Lowlanders say , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet he spoke as if we were specimens , like a strain of Lori . That annoyed me , so I would n't give him what he had come for , which was my history . " When I was the age you are now , my brother Bryn and I were contracted to marry Nissa of Bulle , who would grow to be our wife and Queen of Erewhon . When I was twelve and Bryn fifteen - the same age as Nissa - we traveled to Bulle to " steal " our bride , as is custom . When we got back , Erewhon celebrated with the biggest party I ever saw and afterward Nissa spent the night with Bryn . I was too young to be a husband to her , though we would play knucklebones , or other children 's games . That way Nissa and I grew friends , and then , after several years , husband and wife . But we lived without passion , all three of us . So when love did strike Nissa and Bryn , it did like a thunderbolt . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within it . " Market day in the Highlands is a spectacle , even without the added excitement of an Assizes and a sensational lawsuit . I woke early , to the sounds of shouts , goods being trundled down the main street , the shrill cries of Lori . When I came downstairs , the meal area of the Inn was full . Bel was cutting buckwheat bread ; she handed me a slice , spread with Lori butter , at the same time jerking her head at the open door . I took the hint and went outside . Immediately I found myself in the middle of a herd of Lori , who assessed the stranger intelligently from under their black topknots , then parted and pattered around me . The animal was a miracle of genetic engineering , combining the best of sheep , llama and goat , but with threetoed feet causing less damage to mountain soils than hooves . Like the other Highland animals it was dark , resistant to skin cancer ; a boon in an area cursed with thin ozone , even so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lori designer might have been the social architect who engineered the lives of Highlanders with the Rule . If so , I wondered why human genes had not been manipulated as well , given that these people had insufficient protective melanin , varying as they did from pale to brown . Suffeners met by sunlight would be shrouded in the robes of Lori homespun that served all purposes , from formal to cold-weather wear , wide flax hats and the kohl that male and female daubed around their eyes in lieu of the precious Tech sunglasses . But inside , or under protective awnings such as those strung over the market square , hats would be doffed , robes flipped back like cloaks , displaying bare skin , gaudy underrobes and the embroidered or beaded or tattooed emblems of the Highland Houses . It was a paradox : outwardly , dour Puritanism ; inwardly , carnival . I stood on the fringes , observing the display of goods and people . Nobody in sight was armed , well , not visibly , but I had read too many accounts of bloodshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the marketplace . The most obvious source was the young men , who tended to ostentatious ornament , an in-your-face statement of aggressive sexual confidence . The women were less showy , but had an air of defensibility , as if being hard-bitten was a desirable female trait in the Highlands . Small wonder , I thought , recalling the mock kidnap in the marriage ceremony , and how common real raids had been until recently . I felt a little too conspicuously a visitor , so bought a second-hand robe , the wool soft but smelly , and draped it over my shoulders . Thus partially disguised , I wandered among the stalls . A one-eyed man watched over Scavenged Tech rubbish , cans , wires , tires ; a nursing mother examined the parchments of designs offered by the tattooist ; a group of teenage boys , herders from their staffs , noisily tried on strings of beads ; and two husky young men haggled over a tiny jar proffered for sale by an elderly woman . Hungry for overheard talk , information , I lingered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly taken with one design , a serpent eating its own tail . Conversation ebbed around me , and I learnt the oneeyed Scavenger had found a new site , that the herders were n't impressed by the selection of beads , that the mother wished to mark that she now had children by all three of her husbands with a celebratory tattoo , and that the men were buying a philter or aphrodisiac , for use on a third party . Now I was slipping into the flow of Suff speak , I quickly comprehended the old woman 's spiel : " If Celat had tried my potion on Erewhon , none of this would have happened . " All within earshot involuntarily glanced up at the bulk of the biggest building in the town , the Courthouse/lockup . I had , in my wanderings through the market , seen many emblems of greater or lesser Houses , a distinction the Highlanders made by the size of the land holdings . The signs were displayed on people and also the stalls , signaling the goods that were the specialties of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had noted two emblems unseen : the blue swirl of Erewhon , and the red sword blade of Celat . Those entitled to bear them currently resided within the lockup , while the merits of their respective cases were decided . On the one hand , unlawful detention and threatened rape ; on the other , abduction , arson and murder . No wonder the town was packed . Sadry : The place of graves at Erewhon is a birch grove and as we walked through it , hand in hand , my parents named each tree : " This is Bryn 's , this Moli the trader 's , by chance at Erewhon that night and forever after . " It was a peaceful spot , even with the new thicket of saplings , Nissa 's work . I could believe that any ghost here would sleep and not walk - which was precisely why I had been brought there . Idris : Nissa and her lover were buried in the snow , were n't they ? Or at Bulle ? Sadry : I do n't know ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that night 's meal , the sound also coming from below , as the Celats , housed on the ground floor , were simultaneously fed . Sadry : On that day , or one soon after , I saw above the birches a line of pack Lori winding their way down the mountainside . Their flags had the device of a bee : Westron , our nearest neighbors . And that proved to be the first of many visits from the local and not so local Houses . Me : Including the Celats ? Sadry : nods The message would always be the same : Erewhon has been decimated , and you need an alliance . That meant , me plus whoever was the highest bidder . But my father said to all and sundry that they had made such offers before , when he was the sole survivor of Erewhon House . And had he not responded by a second marriage with a lowland woman , outside the Rule ? I , as his only child and heiress of Erewhon , also should have the opportunity of making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They agreed to that ? Sadry : With grumbling , yes . Ever since contact was re-established between North and Suff , nearly a century after the Crash , anthropologists had been fascinated by the Rule . Much of their interest was prurient , with accounts of giant beds for the Queen and her consorts ( a lurid fantasy , given the Intrigue configuration ) . I had in my pack a report positing the mechanisms by which Highland men could apparently switch from het monogamy , albeit with a brother or brothers involved in the marriage ; to bisex , when an additional unrelated male entered the House , a partner for both husbands and wife ; to homosex , with the Queen relationship purely platonic . It was not exactly light reading , but I persisted with it , lying on the pallet , the hum of bees filling my ears . In the end the graphs and diagrams were too much for me , and I simply stared at the wall and thought . On , for instance , how easily the complex relationships in a Rule marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme example . Yet divorce , with people " walking out and down , " i.e. , to the Lowlands or to join the itinerant traders , was uncommon . Highlanders had a vested interest in conciliation , in preserving the group marriages : that was why many houses contained Mediators , skilled negotiators . The ideal was embodied in a toy I had bought at the market , that little girls wore dangling from their belts : a lady-doll on a string , with a dependent number of men-dolls . Why , I wondered , dandling the puppets , did sexual options not exist for women as well as men , with , say , linked girl-dolls ? Were the Queens simply too busy with their men ? Feeling frustrated , I wandered outside and found Bel attending to the hives . " Come see ! " she said , and so I donned over my Highland robes the spare veil and gloves hanging behind the hut door . Bel had lifted the roof off a hive , and I stared over her black shoulder at the teeming mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally said , " why a hive is unlike a Rule House . She nodded , invisible behind her veil . " Ever see a Hive where the drones bossed the show ? Or without any other female bees ? It would be impossible .... " " As a House with two Queens ? " I finished . She straightened , holding a comb-frame in her gloved hand , staring across the valley at the Courthouse roof . " You 're learning , story-eater . " SADRY : Highlanders say when you die you go downriver , and that is what happened to me . My life at Erewhon with my parents , then my father only ( after my mother went , as the Lowlanders say , underground ) that is upriver to me . Everything since is the next life . She spoke with such intensity that I almost reached out and touched her , to belie the words . I went out alone after a stray Lori , the best yearling we had . Our herders had given up searching and my father was ill in bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drowned , so I followed the Lori paths along a stream raging with snowmelt . Almost at its junction with the great river that runs from Erewhon to the lowlands , I saw a patch of color in a large thornbush overhanging the torrent : a drowned bird , swept downstream until it had caught in the thoms . But though it was shaped like the black finches of the Highlands , the feathers were white-gold-red : a throwback to the days before the hole in the sky opened . I wanted the feathers for ornament , so leant on the thornbush , to better reach out - but the bank collapsed beneath me . The water was n't deep and the bush cartwheeled in its flow , taking me , my robes entangled in the branches , into the great river . Up and down I was ducked , alternately breathing and drowning , tom by thorns , or dashed against riverstones . All I could do was grab at air when I could .... She paused and I again noted the fine white lines on her exposed skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue in the palm of one hand , where she must have clutched at the bush despite the pain , in the process defacing and almost obscuring her birth marker , the Erewhon tattootattoo . I think miles went by , hours - for the next thing I recall was the evening moon . I gazed up at it , slowly comprehending that I lay still , out of the helter-skelter race of the river , and that something wet and sluggish held me fast . From the taste of silt in my mouth I knew that the bush had stuck in the mudflats where the river widens . In the moonlight I saw solid land , shoreline , but when I tried to struggle toward it I found I had no strength left . But I lived ! And surely my fathers " herders would soon find me . Idris : You 'd forgotten .... Sadry : On whose land the mudflats were . So I shivered through that night , until the morning sun warmed me . I had no protection against it , so covered my face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for help . Idris : The next bit is my story .... Sadry : laughing Tell it , then . Idris : The river had lately brought we Celats a fine young Lori , freshdrowned . So in hopes of further luck , I scavenged in the mudflats again . The bush sticking up like a cage , I noticed that first . Next I saw a faint movement like a crab , a human hand , then eyes looking at me out of the mud . I had to use the pack Lori to drag her out , she was stuck so fast , halfdead as she was . And the bird too , the one that had brought her to me , I found that when I washed the mud from her robes . She pulled from beneath her underrobe a thong , pendant from it a lovecharm fashioned from tiny feathers , white-gold-red . Sadry almost simultaneously revealed a duplicate charm . I wondered again at the mixture of toughness and sentimentality of the Highlanders , then at the strength of this pair , one to survive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save her .... In my cozy north , teenage girls are babies , but these two had a life 's hard experience.J In the courtroom , they looked tiny , my quarry , against the black-clad might of the Highland Rule . The tribunal hearing this case consisted of a Judge from Chuch , the Suff capitol , a Northern Government representative , and the only empowered woman in sight , Conye of Westron . This Queen had been the subject of a classic study , so I knew her story well but still boggled at the fact that this dignified old lady with the multiple tattoos had seven husbands . I bent toward Bel , sitting beside me in the public gallery . " Now she is like the Queen of a Hive ! " I murmured . " Only because she outlived all her drones ! " Bel replied . Around us , Suffeners commented too , court etiquette permitting this background buzz , along with eating and the nursing of babies or pets . " -I ai n't disrespecting new dead , but old Erewhon was mad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellyful of the Rule , had n't he - " " - but risking all that House lore being lost- " " Excuse me , " said a male voice , from behind me . " You 're the anthropologist ? " I turned to see a fellow Northerner , nervously holding out an ID . It read : Fowlds , journalist . " I 'm normally posted in Chuch , so I ca n't make head or tail of this mountain law , " he said . " And you 'd like an interpreter ? Meet Bel ! " The Innkeeper grinned , speaking slowly and precisely : " The two girls in that dock are one party ; the two men another . They tell their stories , and the judges decide who are to be believed . " " Ah , " he said . " And who is likely to be credible ? " Around us Suffeners sucked sweets and eavesdropped happily . " Well , " said Bel , " on the one hand we have a House wealthy and respected , but eccentric  --  maybe to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Sadry of Erewhon , second generation Rule-breaker . On the other hand , Idye and Mors of Celat , a lesser House . Now they are Scavengers , but once Celat were mercenaries , hired trouble , before your North outlawed feuding . " It had been a condition of autonomy , I recalled , which had incidentally obviated the need to have a concentration of fighting men in the fortified Houses . And thus the need to create bonds between them , a prime function of the Rule ? " But the other girl is Idris of Celat ? What is she doing with Erewhon ? " " That 's what the tribunal is trying to establish , " said Bel , as thunderous drumrolls sounded through the court , signaling the formal start of proceedings . SADRY : I knew that somebody found me , but merely thought I had crossed into downriver , this life revisited , with a ghost Lori carrying me on its back to a ghost House . Somebody washed me and bandaged my cuts I asked her if she was an angel spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckwheat mush when it was spooned into my mouth , slept again . The next time I woke , the room seemed full of men , all staring at me . " Idris , do you know who she is ? " said one , in a voice soft and smooth as a stroked cat . " How could I ? " said the angel . " She looks like rotting bait , " said another , so big and hairy I thought him an ogre . " Idris , has she been instructing you how to treat her wounds ? " asked the first . Mutinous silence . Of course I had , for sick as I was , I was still an Erewhon healer . " Only one way to find out ! " said the third , twin of the second , but clearly the leader . He unwrapped the bandage on my right hand , to reveal the palm , which he inspected closely , picking at the scab with his nails . " Blue ! The missing heir of Erewhon ! " Big hands lifted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Intrigue space . Somewhere along the way my raw hand struck rough stone wall , and a red haze of pain washed over me . Even the jolt as the pallet met floor again , in a larger room , I barely noticed . " Where 's that girl ? Idris ? " " Here ! " - but spoken as if through clenched teeth . " Get her good and better , and soon , okay ? " And with that they left . The pain had cleared my head : now I could see that the angel crying as she re-bandaged my hand was only a girl my age , in a room too stuffed with Scavengers " rubbish to be ghostly . " Which House is this ? " I asked , after a while . " Celat . " " Oh , " I said . " Trouble . " " The thugs were Idye and Iain , my brothers ; the smoothie Mors , Mediator of this House , and their lover . " " No Queen ? " I asked , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room . " Idris stared into my face , as if expecting a reaction . Something was wrong , I could tell that . She sighed , and added : " Our mother is years downriver . " Her words and tone were like a trail , down which I chased a hunting beast . " We 've been too poor and disreputable for any marrying since . " The trail was warm now , and I guessed what I would find at the end of it would be unpleasant . " Until you came along , " Idris finished . " That 's why they moved the bed . Do n't you understand ? They want you for Queen of Celat and Erewhon . " Indeed , an ogre with three male heads , ferocious game . I knew I had to fight it , or marry it , but how ? More thinking aloud than anything else , I said : " I 'd sooner marry you ! " Idris : triumphantly " And I said : Do you mean that ? Do you really mean that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges and countercharges , then a series of witnesses appeared . I began to get a sense of Suff law , as the bare bones of the case , what was not disputed by either side , was established . But the mix of ritual and informality in the proceedings disconcerted me , as when Bel waved wildly at some witnesses , a married trio from Greym House . They waved back , before resuming their evidence : that they , being river fishers , had found a hat with blue ties in their net . " At least there 's no argument she fell in the water , " Fowlds commented . Mors of Celat rose and bowed at the judges . I thought him a personable young buck , not as loutish as Idye beside him , with a feline , glossy look - if you liked that sort of thing . An answer to a virgin 's prayers ? Not from the look of black hatred that passed between him and the two girls . " Can he address the court ? I mean , he 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the gallery , leaving me to interpret as best I could . " As a Mediator Mors is privileged to argue points of law . " " They 're marriage counselors , right ? " " Among other things , " I said . " Things get fraught , you need someone like that . Otherwise you might end up like Nissa 's Erewhon . " " Oh , the case people keep on mentioning , " he said . " They 're similar , that 's why . " " But was n't that a mass poisoning ... " he began , but I shushed him as Mors began to speak . " I bring the attention of this court to the law of the Scavengers .... ' " " Cheeky beggar ! " somebody muttered . " Huh ? " said Fowlds . I was feeling confused myself . " Er , I believe it 's basically finders keepers . " " But it 's not been applied to living humans since feuding days , " Bel finished , from behind my shoulder . " But there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my ! " Idris had leapt up , shouting : " I found Sadry , so she 's mine ! Not yours , not anybody else 's . " Conye of Westron rose , and moving effortlessly despite her age , placed herself between the pair , her arms stretched out , invoking quiet . " Another Mediator , " said Bel . " She 'll adjourn the court now , and let people cool off . It 's getting late , so I guess they 'll call it a day . " " See you in court tomorrow , then , " said Fowlds . He bent toward me . " You 're an anthropologist , so is it true that these mountain guys are hot trots ? " " Why do n't you find out ? " I said . " Oh I will ! " - and he wandered away . Bel said : " Come and meet a non-bee Queen . " ( SADRY : Idris 's brothers left us alone , but Mors would bring some small comfort , like fresh milk , sit on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Idris : The thin part of the wedge . Sadry : The thick part being your brothers . I put no trust in him , but he was too engaging for me to keep sulking . It became a game , to talk and parry his flirtation . That way courtship lay , I knew . I asked : " What brought you to Celat ? " and he looked rueful : " Love . Or a potion . Or perhaps both . " Idris : ( sarcastic Men are such romantics . I said : " And you 've stayed here ? " - looking pointedly around the Scavengers " mess . He said : " I mediate when Idye and lain get into trouble . " " Like now ? " I said . He sighed . " This was n't my idea . But as a challenge , I find it seductive . " " As opposed to rape ? " He said , lightly : " You know that is the last resort . " I must have gone white , for he added : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hate that . " When he had gone , I said to Idris : " I suppose he 's not too bad . " On the wall hung the one precious thing I had seen in Celat , a Tech mirror . Idris abruptly lifted it down and set it on my chest , holding it with both hands , so all I could see was my scratched face . " You think , you really think pretty Mors courts you for love , when you look , as Idye charmingly said , like rotten bait ! " " No , " I said , sobered . She touched my cheekbones . " I can see under the surface , but they ca n't . That protects you for the moment . But when you heal .... " I said : " Get word to my father ! " She hesitated , before replying : " Mors came from the market with the news your father 's dead . Of sickness or worry , they say . And so Erewhon is vacant and everyone 's looking for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . After a while I said : " Then we must get out of here all by ourselves . " The Queen proved to be the fisher-girl from Greym , whom we found , together with her husbands , in Bel 's private attic rooms . The trio were replete with honeycake and a keg of the weak Highland beer . Close to , they seemed painfully young , in their mid-teens at most , the two obvious brothers and the girl touchingly in love with each other . Bel introduced them as Milat and Meren and Jossy , saying of the latter : " Pregnant , she tells me , but she wo n't say by whom .... " Jossy grinned with gap-toothed embarrassment . The boys were more forthcoming : " Aw , she 's just kiddin " you , Cos . " Indeed , I thought , the Rule was strict regarding sexual access , precisely to prevent squabbles over paternity . Then I did a delayed doubletake at the last word spoken . Cos meant cousin ... I stared at Bel . " I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Once I could have been a Queen . " Milat coughed . " Aw , that 's old history now . " I was starting to catch on . " You walked out and down from Greym ? Why ? " Bel replied with a question . " You like men ? " she said , looking at Jossy . " You like lots of sex with men ? " " Jossy giggled ; the boys exchanged glances , tolerant of their eccentric relative . " I 'll take that as a yes , " Bel said . Then , more to me : " But if you do n't , then there 's no sense living in misery . I had a pretty young cousin , who would never question the Rule . So I gave my husbands to her . " " Our mam , " said the boys proudly . " These are her twins . I had no children , so I walked free .

" Came down to the village and this Inn , where I asked for work as a kitchenhand , anything . And here I stayed , with Bel , who owned the Inn . When she went underground , I took her name and carried on the business . " She poured out more beer , and sliced the remaining cake . As she did , I noticed a tattoo extending from the palm of her hand to the wrist : an oval enclosing two stylized bees , under a gabled roof . " Two Queens in a House ? " I asked softly , as she passed me the cake . " No , " she replied , " Two worker bees in their Inn . " I took her hand , to better examine the device , and then noticed the pigment of one bee was faded , and that it was drawn differently from the other . It also looked vaguely familiar - and I whistled softly as I recognized a birth marker , the bee of Westron modified into an emblem that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have guessed you were born at Westron .

" " Conye 's cranky on me , for letting the House down . " She paused , and what she said next nearly floored me . " But I can get you into the lockup . " She turned to the Greym three : " And you did n't hear that , did you ? " " No , Cos , " muttered one of the boys , and I began to realize the powers of this extraordinary woman . Sadry : Erewhon 's symbol is a blue swirl , the river of life , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our House , just as Dusse has botany and herbalism , and Westron the secret of mead . I nodded , thinking that it was as if when setting up the Rule someone had determined that the precious Tech knowledge and goods be apportioned equally between Houses . Sadry : In our cellars , cut deep into the mountainside , we hoard the artifacts of Tech medicine . Me : I heard you had a pharmacopoeia . Sadry : Yes , a book of the colored beads that the Tech people did n't wear but ate , to keep themselves well . That we salvaged ourselves , other books the Scavengers bring us . Our oldest book , though , is n't medical - it 's called Erewhon , but it 's not about my House , but a dream , a nowhere place . In this book things are reversed : the sick are criminals , and the criminals regarded as ill . Idris : Are we criminal , or ill ? Bel : Both , probably , in the eyes of the men . Sadry : The book-Erewhon seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or the way I would live in my home , with Idris , if the court permits us. lI thought , but did not say , that while Bel could live in the Lowlands , a happy impossibility in Highland terms , two Queens in the same mountain House was probably intolerable for the Rule-followers . Sadry was Queen of Erewhon by inheritance , but if this case went against her she could end up Queen of Nowhere . The Greym three had had a big , exciting day and they drooped like flowers with the dusk . Bel brought them blankets , letting them doze on her private floorspace . After she blew out the candles ( Highland style , of rush and tallow ) , we two retired to the downstairs bar , where she ejected the last drinkers . Now we had the place to ourselves I wanted to interview this runaway Queen , but instead Bel went out . Alone , I stretched out on the hearthrug and watched the fire , thinking of the Houses and their troubles . As I lay there , unbidden came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once heard , with an anonymous woman of Bulle . Bulle woman : The Rule is : share and share body alike in marriage . That 's why Queens seldom have a night to themselves once they wed . It 's best if you 're stolen by brothers , because they 're like beans in the pod , so you treat them the same . But if you 've got one you like less , or one you love most ... that means trouble . Poor silly Nissa ! Interviewer : It was the lover that was the problem , was n't it ? Bulle woman : His name was Yeny . I met him once , and was n't surprised that Bryn Erewhon was head over heels , why he brought him into the marriage . The trouble was Nissa fell for Yeny too , and she wanted him all for herself , like a Lowlander . The sensible thing would have been to let those two walk out and down , but Bryn was stubborn , I guess , like Erewhoners are . He called in a Mediator , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her own hands . Slowly , imperceptibly , I slipped into dream-sleep , images appearing and disappearing before my slitted eyes . First I saw the blue sign of Erewhon , the river twisting into a figure eight , an infinity symbol , then the self-devouring serpent I had admired at the tattooist 's . A log collapsed in the fireplace , and I opened and closed one eye , importing the flamescape into my dream , for now I flew above red mountains . Below my eagle-I were Houses , and I zoomed in and somehow through the thatch roof of Erewhon , to see Nissa ( who looked amazingly like Sadry ) zigzagging through Intrigue . She went down a flight of stone steps to the courtyard where a Scavenger waited with goods for identification and sale : sheets of dirty foil , on one side covered with symmetrical white studs . The dreamwatcher followed Nissa into the cellars , where she consulted a tattered book . When she came out again , she paid the Scavenger , and tucked the drugs into her underrobes . I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking me awake . " Come on ! I 've bribed you an hour 's talk ! " " Wh ... ? " I started to say , then received a spare robe full in the face , and with it the realization of where we were going . " Hurry ! Wrap yourself up ! " she said . Doubly shrouded we slipped into the darkness of the street , the mountain air chill even in summer . The village at first seemed asleep , with the mountains looming over it as if over a cradle , the gleam of snow at their peaks like watchful eyes . But as we moved swift and silent as Loris , I noticed cracks of light under shutters , heard babies " cries or soft talk , and saw distantly , in the gap between two buildings , a group of men carousing around a bonfire , among them Fowlds . " He 'll get slipped a philter and good and proper fucked , " Bel commented . " That 's what he wants , " I said . After what seemed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly realized was a back entrance to the Courthouse . Inside , someone waited for us , robe thrown completely over the head , almost like Bel beekeeping . The apparition led us up stairs of scavenged Tech concrete to the second floor , where a door was unlocked for us , then locked behind us . Sadry was awake , spinning Lori wool on a spindle , the Highland cure for fidgets , or using up time . I could see for the first time her scars , and her composed , indeed , queenly mien . Idris slept , her head on Sadry 's knee ; she stirred as we approached , knuckling her eyes . For a long moment there was silence , before Bel fumbled under her robe and produced delicacies : fresh Lori cheese , fruit , cured meat . " Greetings Bel Innkeeper , greetings Northerner , " Sadry said , her voice neutral as she accepted the gifts . I had nothing to offer , but nonetheless pulled out my tape recorder from under my robes . Idris goggled at the device , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set down and used against us ? " " For an interview , " I said , alarmed , " It 's standard practice . " " I did n't agree to a Tech toy , " Sadry said . She looked at Bel . " Your intermediary never mentioned it .... " Idris reached forward , as if to snatch away the device , and I clutched it , inadvertently activating Record . She spoke , her voice a snarl , rising ... until Bel clapped a hand over her mouth . " Hush , " she said . " Would you wake the guards ? When the Northerner is like me , and like you ! " Idris 's eyes rolled . I said , my voice trembling , now I was so near to my goal , and yet not there yet : " I ... we ... my friends ... we monitor ... looking for ... breakers of the rules ... even in such a male-dominated society ... you see , it 's so important that you exist , we need a record ... of women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " The gaze of these two girl lovers met , considering my plea . I started the interview story-eater style , using the polite Highland opener of recounting my latest dream . One dream demands another , and so Sadry responded with her ghost story , continuing the theme of Nissa , which recurred as if haunting the conversation : SADRY : My father said he got sick of it , Bryn moping , Nissa storming , and Yeny in the middle ( who was not his lover ) unable to make up his mind . So he went off herding .... Idris : It saved him from a dose of worm-cure ! I thought of my dream again . If Bel had not shaken me awake , I possibly might have continued the dream , with Nissa-Sadry one snowy night serving herin-laws a Bulle herbal remedy , but combined with what from the pharmacopoeic texts in the library she knew to be sleeping pills . Presumably she wanted everyone in the House to sleep long enough for her and her lover to elope . Murder meant feuding , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , or her curse , as the Highlanders said , that the pills were contaminated , or when combined with the herbs , toxic . Ten people died at Erewhon , two more when Nissa 's flight ended in an avalanche  --  incidentally saving , as the Bulle woman had noted , that House from a ruinous bloodprice . Me : What saved Mors ? They eyed me . This I knew was the nub of the case , whether the story of Nissa had repeated with Sadry . Idris : He was called away to Mediate , in a dispute over some Lori . Me : And with only two men left in the house , you acted . Idris : They got drunk as pigs . Me : On pissweak Highland beer ? Idris defensively : Maybe they had mead . Me : That 's a luxury . You said Celat was poor . Sadry : What is this ? An interview or an interrogation ? Bel : It will help you ! And you need help . Long pause Me : What happened ? Idris : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs with sop for Sadry . We could hear roistering below , and I barred the door of the Queen 's room with what I could find and move ... without Mors to mediate , Sadry was n't safe . Sadry : The House went quiet . Idris : I went down to see what was going on , and found my brother Iain passed out at the table . Idye was the same , sprawled in the courtyard . Without losing a moment , I went out to the field where our two best and biggest Lori grazed . I brought them into the courtyard , found halters and saddlecloths , then tied them by the door , while I went into the house for my queen . Sadry : I could barely walk , so she near carried me downstairs , and got me onto the Lori . Idris : I went upstairs to get extra robes against the night air , but having a sudden idea , grabbed rags , and a haybale I had been using to re-stuff a pallet . With them I formed a mock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sadry : That done , just like that ! We stole away into the darkness , heading for Erewhon . Idris : hesitant We do n't know what happened next . Me : I hear Idye was too drunk to remember a thing . Idris : I was right to take her ! Iain went into the Queen 's room ! Me : He was fuddled . Sadry : He meant harm . Idris : But in igniting the dummy Queen , he harmed nobody but himself . Me : And the House . I thought again of the Inn fire , of the log imploding in a shower of sparks . Celat House and its flammable rubbish had burnt like Bel 's kindling , leaving ashes-in which Mors and a party from a neighboring House had found the charred form of lain , a metal candleholder and long-bladed hunting knife by his side . Idye had survived , simply because he had slumped in the courtyard , out of the flame 's reach . Sadry : We defended ourselves . Me : I understand that , but to the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court to decide . Bel : We should stop now . The guard 's shift ends soon , and I could only afford one bribe ! And she turned the recorder off . End of conversation , with the two defendants , but not with Bel , for when we got back to the Inn she stoked the fire and poured out beer for us . I took a couple of mouthfuls , and said : " This stuff really is feeble . I reckon Idris nobbled her brothers " beer ! " Bel shrugged . " All the village thinks so , but with what ? " Now it was my turn to shrug . " I 've seen a pharmacopoeia book in a museum . It described everything the Tech culture took for their ailments . So , if something drastically increased the effects of alcohol , Sadry would have known it and told Idris . " Bel pulled off her outer layer of robe . " Maybe . " " But how did they get hold of it ? " I wondered . " The House was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . Anything could have been stored there . " I rolled out on the rug again , watching flames . Bel hunkered down beside me . " Well , if we are play judges , and have solved the mystery , what do we do now , given the important difference between this case and Nissa 's ? Idris and Sadry survived , and that means they are answerable for bloodprice . " " Even for an accidental death , " I replied , with a sinking feeling . " And the fratricide makes it worse . Not to mention burning the House , and stealing Idris , the one thing Celat had to barter on the marriage market . " I supped more beer . " Extenuating circumstances . Sadry escaped enforced marriage . " " But she also broke the Rule . " " Into little pieces , " I finished , putting down the mug . " They do n't stand much of a chance , do they ? " Bel put her hand on my shoulder . " That was why I took you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the North . " I turned , and her grip grew firmer , kneading me . " And , because I wanted you to be grateful to me . " I laughed and quoted Idris : " ' Do you mean that ? Do you really mean that ! ' " I had come to the mountains a detached , dispassionate observer , with a story to eat . But , almost despite myself , the case study of Sadry and Idris , and the other like-minded women of the Highlands had come to involve me . Taking Bel 's hand in mine , I touched her bees and felt them slightly raised - a cicatrice . Tonight , we would play Queens of the Inn , and the two bees would crawl all over my skin . And tomorrow , to celebrate , I would go to the market tattooist and mark myself with the snake - for now this mountain herstory was part of me , and I was a serpent eating my own tale .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
