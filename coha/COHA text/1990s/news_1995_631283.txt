<p> Filmmakers Allen and Albert Hughes are a study in contrasts . They are , at least , on this particular fall morning , which has been a rather early one for them . The 23-year-old identical twin brothers at once seem desperately tired yet interminably frisky . Somewhat brash , yet polite . Childlike and yet professionally precocious . <p> They 've been doing radio interviews since 6:30 a.m. , promoting their new film " Dead Presidents " ( now playing at local theaters ) . It 's now 9:30 , and one of the brothers , Allen , is already yawning and stretching and drifting a bit minutes into this interview . <p> " You 're really interested , are n't you ? " Albert admonishes . <p> Looking startled that his fatigue has been detected , Allen straightens up and says , " No , ah , the heist . . . . " A second later , he slumps again and concedes , " I 'm tired . " <p> He is n't speaking gibberish . He is trying to identify the most difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brothers produced and directed . <p> " The heeiisst , the heeiisst , " Allen is saying , now exaggerating the fatigue for comical effect . <p> " No , " he says , getting serious , " the heist was the hardest thing to do because it was n't planned as well as we wanted it planned . " <p> " It was cold ! " Albert jumps in . <p> " And we both had flus , " Allen says . " . . . It was just a hard scene to do . It was like in a wind tunnel , right off the river down there in Brooklyn . And it was like 25 degrees in the city . It was zero right there where we were filming . " <p> " The heist " is at the climax of their film , which stars Chicago native Larenz Tate as Anthony Curtis , a young black man who decides right after high school to join the Marine Corps during the Vietnam War and completes his tours of duty only to return to indifference , bitterness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tate 's character helps his buddies execute an armored-car heist to get some dead presidents , or cash . <p> Though the Vietnam War is at the core of the film , the Hughes brothers want to make one thing absolutely clear . <p> " The movie is not a Vietnam movie , " says Albert , who handles the cameras and technical end of filmmaking while Allen mostly works with the actors . " We consider it a coming home kind of movie , or a coming-of-age movie . Where one character goes from point A to point B , and these factors in between get him there and the war is just one of them . This could 've been any war . This could 've been the Korean War . " <p> " Dead Presidents " is based on actual events as told in the book Bloods by author Wallace Terry , and the screenplay was written by Michael Henry Brown , whom the Hughes brothers contacted after admiring his work on the HBO series " Laurel Avenue . " The film boasts a soulful soundtrack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White , Aretha Franklin , Curtis Mayfield , James Brown and Sly and the Family Stone . <p> Besides Tate , the film also stars Rose Jackson ( starring in Fox 's new sitcom " The Crew " ) , N'Bushe Wright ( " Zebrahead , " " Fresh " ) , Keith David ( " Clockers , " " Platoon " ) , Chris Tucker ( " Friday " ) and Bokeem Woodbine ( " Jason 's Lyric , " " Panther " ) . <p> Tate rose to acclaim with his role in the Hughes ' first feature film , " Menace II Society , " which was a surprise hit in 1993 . He played a ruthless teen thug named O-Dog . His innocent look made his performance all the more effective . But looks can be deceiving . <p> Looking at the Hughes brothers , for instance , one might have to stave off a desire to pat them on their heads , so to speak . They 're adorable and boyish , dressed in the oversized phat fashion of the hip-hop set . Allen is munching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a.m . <p> But pat them on their heads and you could get slapped  --  or worse . These brothers are veterans of the ruthless movie game . And they do n't want to be mistaken for lightweights because they 're young . <p> They say that dealing with older , more experienced actors and filmmakers has its challenges . <p> " It was intimidating on the first one , " admits Allen , " but this time around you 're a little more secure in knowing that even if this person knows more about acting and knows more about anything , it really does n't matter because they do n't know what 's in your head . And ultimately what you 're supposed to put on the screen is what 's in your head . So , they can go , ' Oh , this little young guy does n't know what he 's talking about . ' Maybe I do n't know what I 'm talking about , maybe ( Albert ) does n't know what he 's talking about , but that 's what we envision . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better pretty much be a little in sync with what we 're thinking about the part , " Albert says . <p> They have higher hopes for this film than " Menace II Society , " which opened on 400 screens and grossed $ 30 million . " Menace " led to the deal with Caravan Pictures , the Disney production company behind " Dead Presidents , " which opened this week at 900 theaters nationwide . <p> " We want it to do better than the last one because the last one did n't have a lot of opportunity as far as the screens it was on . This one 's on more screens and we just want it to open big and hopefully stay out there for a while , " Allen says . <p> They speak with excitement about their future . The " Dead Presidents " soundtrack was released through Underworld Records , their Capitol Records subsidiary . The brothers also are looking into extending their relationship with Disney , through which " Dead Presidents " was released as part of a two-picture deal . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is offering the pair " a pretty flattering deal " that may include them heading a studio , Albert says . <p> The brothers are securing deals that could keep them working through the end of the century . <p> " Right now we have lawyers meeting with the Jimi Hendrix estate , trying to get the rights to that movie , " Allen says . <p> " Somebody could 've beaten us to it , " Albert says . " Thousands probably already have tried , but it 's been so hard because the rights were split up three different ways . Now the father has them all . So it 's easy now to go and make a movie . Easier , not easy . It might take us a few years just to hammer out all the details . This might not be until late ' 97 or late ' 98 . " <p> " It 's comforting , if anything , " Allen says . " Just as long as we secure that movie , we can survive with that movie . We can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own little small projects if we want , but we 're probably not gon na do that much work on the side . " <p> If " Dead Presidents " takes off in the fashion that " Menace " did , they wo n't have much to worry about for a long time . And , as Allen tells it , they 're bound to become better filmmakers . <p> " As far as production design , the technique as far as the acting , as far as camera style , I think everything has improved , " Allen says . " We 're going to keep on improving . It 's not going to stop there . "
