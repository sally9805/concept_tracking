Every day in Charleston , S.C. , the South rises again . Airport advertisements hawk local plantations preserved in antebellum splendor . The Old City Market sports Sambo lawn jockeys and fat black mammy dolls holding pigtailed blond babies . And a few blocks away , the Rebel flag blazes in a store window . <P> But hold that mint julep , Rhett : the flag in question is done in red , black and green  --  the colors of African liberation . In the heart of the city where the first shots of the Civil War rang out , Sherman Evans and Angel Quintero , both 34 , both black , have fired a volley of their own . At NuSouth , their 10-month-old boutique , all the gear features that red , black and green flag logo , a symbol , they say , of racial solidarity . " It 's about unification , not polarization , " says Quintero , noting that most of his customers are white . The line has caught the attention of entertainers like the popular R.-and-B. group Boyz II Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll sell out , " predicts Patrick Petty , owner of Culture Shock , a funky Boston boutique that intends to carry the line . <P> The NuSouth partners see themselves as taking on giants like Polo and Tommy Hilfiger . They object to the way those mainstream manufacturers are , in their view , " pimping " urban culture . " A $25 Hilfiger T shirt means nothing , " challenges Evans , who , like Quintero , is black . " This is an empowering message for us , by us and about us . " <P> At first the logo hit like hot grease in cold water  --  it caused a high school student to be suspended when she wore it to school in nearby Goose Creek . Passersby have also had visceral , sometimes negative responses . But Evans and Quintero say the reactions are always followed by conversation . Even Confederate loyalists , they claim , have walked out of the boutique as fans  --  and customers . <P>  --  By Tamala M. Edwards/Charleston             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
