IN THE MOMENTS THAT HAVE MATTERED most in Bob Dole 's life , he has found himself alone . He was alone when he charged up a rocky hill to a German machine-gun nest , to be torn apart by an artillery shell . That experience took him to places where no one could help him . The surgeons could do only so much . His mother , who would have done anything for him , could n't do anything when she came upon him hanging from the rafters of their garage by his shattered arm , trying to make it work again . <P> Twice before he has lost his party 's nomination , and now that he is finally on the verge of clinching it , he finds himself again alone in a place he has never been before : in the finals , facing a formidable incumbent President . The new experience has left the Candidate of Experience " somewhat off balance , " says a top aide , a little unsure of his next move . So early next month Dole is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun outside his condominium and then gather around him a group of wise men and women to think through the campaign . Just holding such a meeting is unusual for Dole , who has never been quick to seek or take advice . " He has no peers , " says a top aide . " He has colleagues ; he has friends . But all his real peers are dead . He 's outlived them all . " <P> Dole has captured one of politics ' greatest prizes without one of the most important ingredients of any successful campaign : a tight circle of trusted advisers who can tell him when he 's right , when he 's wrong and when he needs to shape up . Dole simply believes he knows more about politics than anyone else . The last man whose advice he wholly trusted was Richard Nixon . " That was the only time I ever saw him sit up and sit still for more than 10 minutes and listen , " said Tom Korologos , describing a trip the two men made to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dole has preferred to keep his own counsel and even make fun of anyone who tries to change him . When an aide recently gave him an advance text of a speech , the candidate quipped with trademark sarcasm , " Let me show this to my council of advisers . " He pushes back when pushed too hard . When Senator Al D'Amato of New York urged Dole two weeks ago to attend a debate before the Texas primary  --  " You got ta go , " D'Amato said , " you got ta go "  --  Dole teased , " Well , if you want me to , I wo n't . " <P> After 35 years in Washington , Dole has an astonishingly small circle . He has a coterie of old friends , including Democratic Party viceroy Bob Strauss and Archer Daniels Midland Co. chairman Dwayne Andreas , but he does not seek their counsel . Other than his wife Elizabeth , who is an ad hoc adviser on nearly everything , Dole 's inner circle is made up of Senators Pete Domenici of New Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even they say they are not sure what he absorbs . He taps experts on specific policy matters when he needs them  --  including his chief of staff , Sheila Burke , and adviser Robert Lighthizer  --  but does most of the political thinking himself .
