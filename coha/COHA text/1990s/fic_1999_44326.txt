It 's shutting your kidneys down . And you need at least one healthy kidney to live . I 'm afraid you 're going to need a kidney transplant . Shirlee : No way ! I never even borrow a comb . I certainly do n't want some stranger 's kidney . Dr. Jenkins : Oh , it 's all right . Most kidneys used in transplants are from cadavers . Shirlee : That 's even worse . No way I 'm taking a dead person 's body parts ! Dr. Jenkins : I have to be frank with you , Shirlee . A transplant is the only option we have left . Narrator 2 : Daniel tries to stay optimistic , but the idea of losing his grandmother makes him very depressed . Narrator 1 : At a bowling alley , Daniel and Theresa are on a date , but Daniel 's mind is miles away .

Wow , I never realized it took so long to get one . Daniel : Neither did I. Ther-sa : How many kidneys does a person have ? Daniel : Just two . But you can live with only one . I 'm really scared , Theresa . If anything happened to Gran ... I 've always been able to count on her , no matter what . Narrator 2 : : The next day , Daniel and his friend , Jeff , toss around the football . Daniel : You ever think about what you 'll be doing in 10 years ? Jeff : Graduating from high school , probably . Daniel : C'm on , for real . Jeff : Well , I 'd like to go to law school . Daniel : You 'd be good at that . What if there was something you could do now that would be a real good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lawyer . Jeff : It depends . Why ? Daniel : I 've been doing a lot of research about transplants . And ... well ... could donate a kidney to my grandma . Photograph Daniel knows he 'll have to sacrifice a lot to save Shirlee . <p> Jeff : You ? So , like , they 'd slice you open , yank out one of your kidneys , and put it in your grandmother ? DanIel : I guess . Jeff : And you 'd be fine afterwards ? Daniel : Yeah . Except Jeff : Except what ? Daniel : I would n't be able to play football . Ever again . SCENE 5 Narrator 1 : The next day , Daniel goes to the hospital to talk with Dr. Jenkins . Dr. Jenkins : Your grandmother 's very sick , Daniel . Sometimes the best we can do is offer our love and support , and make the patient comfortable until the end . Daniel : That 's just not enough . If I donate my kidney to her , we can skip the whole waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live , right ? Is n't that what 's best for her ? Dr. Jenkins : But it might not be the best thing for you , Daniel . Daniel : She 'd do it for me , if she could . Dr. Jenkins : Have you talked it over with her yet ? Daniel : No . Narrator 2 : Daniel tells Shirlee what he 's been thinking about . Her reaction is n't exactly what he had hoped for . Shirlee : Are you crazy ? ! The answer is no . No ! Daniel : The doctor said the risk is really low . Shirlee : No . With one kidney , there 's no way you could play football . A hit in the wrong place and you could be dead . Daniel : You 're the one who taught me to stand up for what 's right , Gran . This is right . Shirlee : Football is what 's going to get you to college . That 's my dream , to see you achieve what I could n't . Daniel : Your dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people who need you , who love you . If you wo n't do this for yourself , then do it for them . Shirlee : I do n't know what all the fuss is about anyway . We might not even match . Daniel : Then I guess we 'd better find out . Narrator 1 : Daniel needs to find out if he and Shirlee are a match . Coach Farkas gives him a ride to Chicago for the medical tests , and they talk in the car on the way . Coach Farkas : I 'll tell you , Huffman , you make choices in life . I used to play football . I played for Bobby Bowden . I took Pittsburgh to the Orange Bowl . Daniel Wow ! That 's great . Coach Farkas : But I got injured . Bad : Blew out my knee . I got picked up by the NFL for a while , but the pain was so bad , I never knew from one game to the next if I could play . One day , I woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world with what I knew best . So here I am . Daniel : I 'm sorry Coach Farkas : Hey , you win a few , you lose a few . And to tell you the truth , I like working with you kids . There 's more to football than just tackling and touchdowns . SCENE 6 Narrator 2 : Daniel goes through a battery of painful tests in Chicago , but nothing can stop him from finding out if he can be a donor for Shirlee . Narrator 1 : When Daniel returns home , Shirlee is so weak she can barely stand up . But later , he sees her talking on the phone . Daniel : Who called ? Shirlee : It was Dr. Jenkins . She got the test results . We 're almost a perfect match . Narrator 2 : Daniel runs over to the couch and hugs her . Daniel : This is awesome ! Shirlee : No , it 's not . I was hoping we would n't match , so we could put an end to this nonsense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 : This is too much for Daniel . All the excitement and fear of the last few months overwhelms him . He starts to cry . Shirlee puts her arm around him . She can see the tears running down his face . Daniel : You 've got to do it . Please do n't die ... I do n't know what I 'd do without you , Gran ... Please do n't die ... Narrator 2 : Shirlee thinks for a long time . Then she takes Daniel 's hands . Shirlee : I guess I 'd better go and get my hair done if I 'm going to have a lot of doctors poking around my insides . SCENE 7 Narrator 1 : Days later , Daniel and Shirlee check into a hospital in Chicago . The doctors perform the complicated operation , taking out one of Daniel 's kidneys and transplanting it into Shirlee . When Daniel wakes up , he 's groggy , but his grandfather is there with him . Danny : How do you feel ? Daniel : I do n't know . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . First thing she asked about was you . Does it hurt ? Daniel : Only when I breathe . Narrator 2 : Over the next two months , Daniel and Shirlee recuperate from the surgery . The kidney works perfectly for Shirlee , and she makes a full recovery . Daniel recovers , too . He goes back to school , but he misses playing football more than he thought he would . SCENE 8 Narrator 1 : At the end of the year , Daniel 's team is still in first place , but he ca n't bear to watch the games . Then , for the last game of the season , Theresa and Shirlee drag Daniel to the stadium , and they sit in the bleachers . Daniel : I do n't see why I have to be here . We 're up by 25 points . They do n't need me cheering to win . Theresa : The coach said he 's got ta see you . Shirlee : It 's real urgent . Coach Farkas : Huff-man ! C'mere ! Daniel : I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't a request . It was an order . Narrator 2 : Reluctantly , Daniel goes onto the field . All his teammates are there , and so is an older man , a man Daniel recognizes . Daniel : Wow ! Bobby Bowden . I 'm a big fan of the Seminoles , sir . You 're a terrific coach . Bobby Bowden : Thanks . I 've heard a lot about you , too , Daniel . I hear you 're the star player around here . Daniel : Well , maybe I used to be . But now ... I should get back to my seat . Coach Farkas : Hold it , Huffman . Put on your pads . Daniel : Pardon ? Coach Farkas : And your jersey . Jeff ( smiling ) : Yeah , I have a bad headache , Coach . You take my place , Pudge . Mike : And take my cleats . You ca n't play barefoot , bro . Daniel : What 's going on here ? Coach Farkas : You 're too young to understand this now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the memory of being part of this game . Just stay 20 yards behind the line of scrimmage . Nobody 'll hit you . You 'll be fine . Daniel : But I Coach Farkas : Get out there ! Narrator 1 : Daniel suits up and joins his teammates on the field . His heart pounds with excitement . On the last play of the game , the quarterback grounds the ball as soon as it 's snapped . Narrator 2 : The whistle blows . The game ends . The crowd goes wild . It takes Daniel a moment to realize they 're cheering for him . The coach was right . He 'll never forget that moment . Afterward Narrator 1 : Daniel Huffman was given a full scholarship to Florida State University , where he is currently a student trainer for the Seminoles , coached by Bobby Bowden .
