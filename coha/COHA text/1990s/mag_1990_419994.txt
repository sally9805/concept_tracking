Traveling in groups makes it easier for them to find food and avoid the jaws of death , but how they go about it is still a mystery <p> Twilight descends on the coral reef . Hordes of glassy sweepers edge skittishly toward the mouths of caves that have sheltered them during daylight . As underwater shadows deepen and disappear , a few score venture forth , silvery bodies flashing in the fading light . As their numbers swell into the thousands , they move back and forth along the face of the reef , surrounded by predators . More and more restless the milling throng becomes , until darkness is nearly complete . Then , running the gauntlet of gaping jaws around them , they burst out into open water to scatter and feed under cover of darkness . <p> For many fish species , survival means fellowship with others of their kind  --  whether in tightly organized schools or looser aggregations . The way they stick together and the varied behaviors they exhibit have delighted , perplexed and amused observers for centuries ( SMITHSONIAN , January @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than half a dozen , and may be sociable for only a few days or weeks a year . Others spend almost their entire lives swimming in formation with thousands of their fellows , packed together so tightly that they nearly rub fins as they swim . <p> To coordinate their activities , fishes communicate in many and sometimes most unusual ways . Some rely on sight and distinctive body-color patterns . Most have special sense organs on their skins that can " hear " the movement of their cohorts through the water around them . Others talk to one another in private languages of clicks , grunts and growls . And still others communicate with electric pulses that they generate in highly specialized muscles . <p> Different kinds of fish schools can be both similar to and different from other kinds of animal groups . We 've learned over the past 20 years or so , for example , that many animal societies are collections of close relatives ; the 22 million members of the African driver ant colonies are all sisters ( though they may have different fathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lion prides and certain monkey troops  --  are at least as closely related as cousins . Not surprisingly , many intricate , fascinating and often savage things that these animals do  --  ranging from aggression and infanticide to food sharing and caring for the young of others  --  are based on the individuals ' ability to keep track of who is related to whom . <p> Among fishes , though , familial relationships are looser . Many schooling species engage in group sex during spawning  --  a wild affair during which mad dashes and gyrations by ensembles of males and females lead to the release of countless invisible sperm and nearly invisible eggs . Unlike birds ( and some solitary or pair-forming fish species ) , who feed or shelter their young , and mammals , who suckle them , schooling fishes abandon eggs and larvae to float away on the currents . This drifting makes it unlikely that the fish in large schools are closely related to one another , and the lack of interaction between parents and offspring makes it equally unlikely that they themselves can tell whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have the same sorts of " personalities " as more familiar animal groups . Some , like large flocks of many birds , appear to be egalitarian . Large schools of open-water fishes and the small clusters of minnows you 're apt to see in shallow water may not have predetermined " leaders . " Instead , decisions are somehow made by one or more individuals within the school signaling by behavior changes that they have detected food , predators or better water conditions . The message spreads from those individuals like a wave across the group , gradually affecting everyone in the crowd . The pecking order and sexual politics <p> Other schools , particularly in species that stake out a territory to live in , have definite hierarchies . Certain individuals ( usually one or more large males ) live at the top of the pecking order ; other members fall into rank order beneath them . <p> In some species , this tightly organized social structure can include remarkable examples of sexual politics . Schools of brightly colored scalefin anthias , for instance , consist of orange-red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this species hatch into females . As they mature , they join a predominantly female school at the bottom of a pecking order in which larger females dominate smaller ones . Above the largest dominant females , a small number of males hold sway . <p> As long as school population remains stable , so do the sex roles of members . But if a male disappears , the largest female changes sex ; within two weeks , its body colors , its behaviors and its gonads have transformed into those of a fully functional male . Just how these changes are triggered and controlled remains a mystery . <p> As intriguing as group sex and transsexuality may be , however , they must have evolved after some fish species began to live in schools . There are real advantages to schooling that concern two of the most important parts of life in nature : finding a meal and avoiding being made into someone else 's dinner . <p> In large schools , as in many bird flocks , only a few members need to find food to alert the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and an equal number of taste buds on flexible barbels to find food far more efficiently than a single fish could . As a school explores a stretch of sandy bottom , any fish that finds a meal stops and begins to dig , stirring up the sand . In no time , the area around it is packed with eager schoolmates , digging and probing for all they 're worth . Eventually , other species of fish , attracted by the ruckus , will home in on the feast . <p> Other schools use the power of numbers to outmaneuver competitors . Surgeonfish , for example , are gentle , even shy creatures that make a living by scraping algae off rocks and coral rubble . But many of the best algal gardens on the reef are guarded by one or another species of scrappy little damselfish . Delicate names notwithstanding , " damsels " act like pint-size Rambos , bullying , attacking and chasing off fishes many times their size . A single surgeonfish attempting to feed on damsel-guarded turf is invariably driven away . But when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is little that even the toughest defender can do . <p> Numbers also offer safety to fish in schools , as they do to antelope and wildebeest of the African plains . Solitary predators have a tough time feeding on tightly schooling prey , in large part because of the visual confusion created by the throng . Faced with a predator , schools perform graceful and effective maneuvers . Twisting , wheeling and flowing like the water they swim in , schools may actually surround a bewildered predator  --  leaving a respectable vacuum around the hungry mouth , of course  --  and flow around it to rejoin out of sight at the rear . As a result , most solitary predators , though they follow schools closely , rarely try to attack the group during the day . <p> But few ( if any ) defenses in nature are absolute . Groupers are constantly vigilant and quickly pick off any unfortunates that stray from the edge of the school . Other predators turn the habits of their schooling prey against them . A swordfish , for example , will race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its bill killing some and maiming others . As the rest of the school flees , the dead and dying are left behind for leisurely dining . Like underwater wolves , jacks stalk schools <p> Schooling is also a less-than-perfect defense against schooling predators . Jacks and bluefish stalk schools in much the same way that wolves and wild dogs stalk herds . Usually jacks try to split their victims into smaller groups and force them up against the surface of the water or into the shallows . Once the siege is set , individual predators take turns making brief , wild dashes into the center . They rarely succeed on these dashes , but the effect is to scare a few individuals out of the school , making them easy targets . Because the predators take turns , all get to eat . You can see this carnage in progress in many parts of the world ; up and down the Atlantic coast , for example , bluefish slaughter menhaden in the otherwise placid waters of coastal bays and estuaries . <p> Finally , schooling works well as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish that school have trouble seeing during dawn and dusk twilight periods , and may become disoriented . Waiting predators ( whose eyes are better suited to dim light ) can pick off disoriented school members fairly easily . At night , scattering rather than schooling is the best defense . <p> Thus the daily cycles of light and dark combine with the advantages and disadvantages of group life to put schools through their paces with clockwork accuracy . Each morning at dawn , wandering glassy sweepers return unerringly ( we know not how ) to the same caves their school vacated the evening before . Schools of scalefin anthias , of goatfish , of scores of gaudily painted species  --  once again secure in their view of the reef around them  --  rise above the coral towers to feed , to breed and to fill the waters with color and motion . <p> By Joseph S.
