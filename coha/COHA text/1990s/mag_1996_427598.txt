Section : World report Humanitarian aid created the crisis in Zaire . Fighting ended it <p> Dateline : Zaire <p> When 26-year-old Francois Ndahiro tried to sneak back into Rwanda a month ago , three Hutu thugs caught him and smashed his right leg with sticks . Unable to walk , the skin on his leg swollen to the bursting point , Ndahiro could only sit and watch last week as 600,000 of his fellow Hutu refugees , suddenly freed from a brutal reign of terror within the very refugee camps that were set up to save them two years ago , streamed back to their homes a short , 15-mile walk across the Zaire-Rwanda border . <p> The surge of returning refugees caught the world almost completely by surprise . Only a week before , Canada was preparing to lead a 10,000-troop multinational force , including as many as 4,000 U.S. soldiers and airmen , to come to the rescue of the refugees . Driven from the camps by a flare-up of local fighting by Zairian rebels , a million Hutus who had fled Rwanda in 1994 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jungle and on the brink of starvation . <p> Yet just days later , relief officials suddenly became aware that what one called a " human tidal wave " had reversed direction . Thousands were crossing the border into Rwanda every hour , the largest movement of refugees ever in so short a time . <p> Evidently , it was not fear of what they would face at home , but fear of what the roughly 40,000 Hutu extremists who held power in the camps would do to them if they tried to leave , that had held them in Zaire . Humanitarian aid meant to help the innocent victims of civil war instead had only prolonged a crisis . " The rebels , " admitted Ray Wilkinson of the office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees , " have sorted out the problem . " A few hundred U.S. troops may still go to the region to provide logistic support for aid shipments , but a major military force is no longer envisioned . <p> Road to hell . Aid workers say the painful lesson from Zaire has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of helping everyone , no questions asked . " This is the crisis that made it abundantly clear that civilians have become weapons in themselves , " says Nan Borton , director of the U.S. Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance . " We are often as much a cause of pain as a source of relief , " acknowledges Mike McDonagh , director of the aid group Concern International . " It 's time to grow up . " <p> The refugee assistance effort in Zaire began with all the right motives . Massive media coverage of the plight of the fleeing Hutus created an outpouringof sympathy . But the camps quickly came under the control of the genocidaires  --  the Hutu extremists of the ex-Rwandan Army and a Rwanda militia , who had fled their homeland with the hundreds of thousands of innocent Hutus . <p> It is now clear that the genocidaires did more than just take advantage of the presence of so many refugees to secure a base of operations and a supply of free food ; they intentionally created this haven for themselves by herding civilians out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in part , deliberately caused , " concluded a U.S. Army study . <p> Documents found last week in the abandoned camps show that they were run as virtual military bases by the extremists . More than 200 extremist Hutu political leaders hunkered down in the camps called the shots . Food meant for civilians was diverted to the military forces . Refugees employed by relief agencies were forced to surrender much of their income to help in training soldiers . Spies kept lists of Rwandan sympathizers to be purged . And the ex-Army had plans to use the camps as a staging area to launch an invasion of Rwanda . <p> The worst of the lot were the 15,000 thugs known as the interahamwe , members of a Rwandan militia heavily implicated in the machete murders and other acts of genocide in 1994 . They acted as " enforcers " in the camps , collecting " taxes " from the refugees , controlling distribution of food and recruiting young males for their ranks . Francois Ndahiro was apparently captured by relatively easygoing militiamen : Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interahamwe regularly threatened relief workers , too . " They stopped every attempt to conduct a proper census , which allowed them to cream off large amounts of excess food and other supplies , " says Allison Campbell , a spokeswoman for CARE International . The international community was spending $1.5 to $2 million a day on the relief effort . <p> In November 1994 , U.N . Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali pleaded with the international community to send a force of 10,000 troops to break the hold of the Hutu militias over their own people in the camps  --  a proposal that went nowhere . Some relief groups like CARE and Medecins sans Frontieres pulled out . But others stayed . <p> It was no surprise when the Hutu militants in the camps began to stage attacks against their rival Tutsis in both Rwanda and Zaire , with some help from poorly disciplined Zairian Army forces . Their savagery fit the pattern , too . In late October a gang of Hutus raided the home of Elizabeth Wimana , near one of the biggest refugee camps . They stabbed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and butchered six other family members . Others nearby reported similar atrocities . <p> The turnabout came this fall when the local Tutsi rebels  --  with backing from the Rwandan Army  --  struck back hard at their Hutu and Zairian Army persecutors . In two days of fighting , the rebels crushed the base inside the main refugee camp at Mugunga , driving the interahamwe into the Zairian bush . <p> Getting serious . It was not entirely a coincidence , though , that the end finally came only after the world was mobilizing to send a sizable military force into the area . Rwanda , fearing that the arrival of a multinational force would only further shield the interahamwe from retaliation , moved to lance the boil . " We have an enemy responsible for genocide which has been launching guerrilla attacks from the refugee camps , " explained Rwanda 's defense minister , Paul Kagame . " If you hit me in the face , I will hit back , and it may not be in your face . " <p> But it is unrealistic to count on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why relief groups are trying new tactics , such as distributing food through women , to keep men from using the food as a bargaining chip . At a White House meeting with National Security Adviser Anthony Lake last week , relief officials recommended against airdrops of military rations to scattered refugees in Zaire for fear that the rations would become just that  --  food for troops . <p> Pulling out . Pushed by CARE International and other major groups , the aid community is trying to agree on a binding protocol to ensure that relief does not become an engine for conflict . The aim is to get the many , sometimes competing aid groups to pledge that they will all pull out if aid is doing more harm than good or if relief workers are threatened . " The humanitarian program has been confused as a solution , " says Nan Borton of the OFDA . " It 's only a way to buy time for a political or military solution . " <p> The swift resolution of the refugee crisis in Zaire could obscure the needfor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be far away . Fighting among ethnic and political foes continues in eastern Zaire , which is growing increasingly unstable . Hutu rebels on the defensive in Zaire have fled into Burundi , where U.N . workers found the bodies of 300 refugees massacred in a church . And Rwanda itself is a sea of tensions , as refugees return to homes occupied by strangers and face scrutiny about whether they contributed to the 1994 genocide . <p> Some officials say the refugees ' return finally gives world powers a chance to materially improve Rwanda 's prospects . Instead of providing food , blankets and other forms of traditional aid for the refugees  --  which the Rwandans say they do n't really need  --  relief organizations could spend money on housing , schools and other resettlement efforts . But with rampant anxiety and mistrust , the window of opportunity is limited . When one Hutu family returned to its home last week , the Tutsis who were living in it summoned Rwandan Army troops to settle who would get to stay on the property . The alarmed Hutus fled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warning shot . It wo n't take too many such accidents to turn a happy homecoming into another round of national mourning . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Tidal wave . More than half a million Hutu refugees abandoned camps in Zaire ( below ) and returned home to Rwanda . <p> By Richard J. Newman , Sam Kiley , Kevin Whitelaw and Tim Zimmermann <p> COMPLEX CATASTROPHE <p> The roots of the humanitarian crisis in Zaire , Rwanda and Burundi are a tangle of ethnic and political rivalries . Zaire . <p> Zairian Tutsis , brutally victimized by the Zairian Army and by Rwandan Hutu militants based in the refugee camps , have fought back and won control of much of the area around Lake Kivu . The fighting drove the Hutu militants out of the camps , freeing hundreds of thousands of Rwandan refugees who had effectively been held hostage in the camps . Rwanda . <p> Hutu militants massacred up to 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus in 1994 . When the current Tutsi-dominated government came to power , more than a million Hutus fled to Zaire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argues that it , not Zaire , should be the focus of international assistance . Burundi . <p> Burundi , which like Rwanda has a population that is 85 percent Hutu and 14 percent Tutsi , continues to suffer from a brutal civil war pitting the Tutsi-led Army against Hutu insurgents . An Army-sponsored coup in July overthrew a moderate government consisting of the two ethnic groups , setting back peace efforts . <p> USN &WR;  --  Basic data  --  UNHCR ; Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance ; National Security Council ; Robert Kemp  --  USN &WR; <p> Map : Complex catastrophe : Africa : Zaire , Rwanda , Burundi <p> By Richard J.
