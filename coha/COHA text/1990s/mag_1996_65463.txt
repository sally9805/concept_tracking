America 's Virtuemeister , William Bennett , looks at the flagship franchise in sports , the Dallas Cowboys , and hates what he sees . Bennett is not alone in his disdain for the Super Bowl champions , but his voice ought to sound an alarm for them . " In the old days the Cowboys were great , and you looked up to them , " says Bennett , a former Secretary of Education and the author of the best-selling The Book of Virtues . " Now it 's different . Now you look down on them . I do admire some people on their team  --  Emmitt Smith , Troy Aikman and others  --  but I think the Cowboys are hurting this country 's morale . As one Texan said to me recently , if this is America 's team , then woe is America . ' " // From owner to coach to star to scrubeenie , the Cowboys are walking a tightrope without a net . This Michael Irvin story , the one with him being indicted on Monday on two counts of drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlaw on this renegade club . Irvin clearly thinks he 's above the law , as this 1993 quote indicates : " If you do n't get caught , you 're not a criminal . " Typical of Irvin , three days after he cursed on national TV following the NFC Championship Game , he was asked if he was sorry he was caught on camera . No , he said , while the minicams were aimed at him again . Then he cursed some more to punctuate his point . // No rebuke . No **29;74;TOOLONG statements from owner Jerry Jones or coach Barry Switzer . " There is no moral compass with the Cowboys , " says Don Beck , a sports psychologist and director of the National Value Center in Denton , Texas , who has studied the team 's relationship with the community . " It 's like , as long as the front office can pay off the attorneys and the other victims , everything will be O.K. Their silence on these things is speaking volumes . " // Jones ca n't play the holier-than-thou role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor can Switzer , who as coach at Oklahoma had an affair with the wife of his defensive coordinator . " Jimmy Johnson was the choke chain , " Beck says of Switzer 's predecessor as Dallas coach . " Without him , there 's been no one to lean on these players . " // Last April tackle Erik Williams was charged with sexual assault of a 17-year-old topless dancer , who later dropped the charges and settled with him out of court . Five months later wide receiver Cory Fleming was arrested on a DWI charge . He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to two years ' probation . In November defensive lineman Leon Lett was suspended for four games and cornerback Clayton Holmes for a year after violating the NFL 's substance-abuse policy . Then , on March 3 , Irvin was caught in an Irving , Texas , hotel room with former Dallas tight end Alfredo Roberts , two women who called themselves " self-employed models , " about three ounces of marijuana , approximately two ounces of cocaine , drug paraphernalia and two vibrators. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Irvin incident , the Cowboys signed free-agent linebacker Broderick Thomas , who last July was arrested for unlawfully carrying a weapon and six months later was nailed on the same charge as well as for drunk driving . At about the same time The Miami Herald reported that several Cowboys rented a house , which they referred to as the White House , where players could meet women for sex and avoid being caught by anyone , including their wives . // " What you 're seeing now , " Beck says , " is the Jerry Jones personal-value system  --  unconstrained , no boundaries , if it feels good do it  --  plus the invincibility and intoxication that comes from winning three Super Bowls in four years . Add the culture of Dallas itself , which is high-status , high-living and very fickle , and it becomes a very dangerous mix . These players see that if you have money , you can get away with anything . " // Last week former Cowboys defensive coordinator Butch Davis , now the University of Miami coach , had former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career was ruined by drug addiction , speak to his team about the dangers of substance abuse . Davis was so impressed he called Jones to recommend Henderson for a consultant 's job with the Cowboys . " Hey , where there 's smoke , there 's fire , " says Henderson , who wants to work for his old team . " Because the NFL does n't test most players for drugs in the off-season , guys will do cocaine and marijuana in that window of opportunity . And nothing happens to them . They 're bulletproof . What I 'm seeing lately in football shows me that no one remembers the Thomas Hendersons , the Len Biases . It does n't take long to ruin your life . " // Bennett says he read last week 's story in SI , which recounted how the police came upon Irvin in the hotel room . " The most discouraging thing , " Bennett said , " was Irvin 's looking at the officer and saying , ' Can I tell you who I am ? ' It was as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's safe . " // Bennett thought for a moment . " Little boys look at TV and watch sports to see men , " he said . Then his voice trailed off . I 'll finish his thought : Where are they ?
