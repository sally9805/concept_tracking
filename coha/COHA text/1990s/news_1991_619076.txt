<p> Apple Computer Inc. has spent much of the past two years catching up with the rest of the personal computer industry . In November , the Cupertino-based personal computer maker introduced a line of notebook computers and high- performance systems that finally brought its product line into parity with its competitors . <p> Now Apple is preparing an assault on the hotly competitive consumer electronics market . <p> And chairman and chief executive John Sculley is moving to fine tune the organization so Apple can prosper through the recession and the new business environment that will follow what he calls an " economic restructuring . " <p> Sculley , who gets up at 3:30 each morning and takes in the latest economic news from Japan and Europe before a run , workout and 7 a.m. staff meeting , fit The Chronicle into his schedule last week . In a wide-ranging interview , the 52-year-old CEO discussed Apple 's interest in consumer electronics , priorities for the 1990s and his outlook on the economy , education and government . <p> Q : Why do you think the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I think there is a transition to computer technology in consumer electronics . Consumer electronics is n't just about hardware . It 's about software , which Apple 's very good at . It will eventually be about things that happen in communications and other services . <p> And I think Apple 's got a name that 's very approachable . <p> Q : How important is your relationship with Sony to that effort ? ( Apple buys disk drives and components from Sony , and Sony is manufacturing one of Apple 's notebook computers ) . <p> A : I think the relationship with Sony is a good building block for that . Apple in many ways has been more influenced by Sony than perhaps any company in the world . But it 's not realistic for Apple to work with only one company , because the consumer electronics business requires many companies to adopt your technology . So I 've been working very hard to build relationships with other Japanese companies . <p> Q : What did Sony bring to the party that Apple did n't have ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at turning products out rapidly . Sony also brings tremendous component technology . Sony also is the leader in audio- visual technology . And that 's going to be a big opportunity . Sony is also a leader in a lot of the production equipment that will be used in the entertainment industry . <p> Q : What does Japan provide that Apple ca n't find here in the United States ? <p> A : There is n't any realistic way that American companies are ever going to catch up with the ( Japanese ) component technology . These are areas that are very capital intensive , and they are willing to take lower returns on sales than we do . <p> If we combine the Japanese ability in component design , together with the entertainment industry 's interest in computerized entertainment products , with our knowledge of computing then I think we 're going to see brand new industries that will be even bigger than today 's personal computer industry . <p> Q : Apple has spent much of the past two years filling in holes in its product line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's next ? <p> A : Now we have to look at every part of the expense structure . We have to make sure that our distribution is effective , in terms of reaching the markets we want . I wo n't tell you what new products we 're working on . <p> But you can look around at where I spend my time . I spend much of my time in Japan . What do the Japanese do ? They do lots of neat things ( that ) tend to be small . We have a very close relationship with Motorola . What do they do ? Communications . So you can expect communications to play a role  --  wireless communications . So miniaturization and wireless are important . <p> Q : What will Apple look like five years from now ? <p> A : I think the computer industry is going to look significantly different than it does today . In the 1990s we 're seeing that a large part of the computer systems business is turning into a commodity business , and the money is being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the Taligent effort is about . ( Taligent is a joint venture company between Apple and IBM to build advanced computer operating software ) It 's about building customized solutions and making sure it works with the Macintosh technology . <p> The second thing is we want to keep the Macintosh going throughout the whole decade . <p> The third thing is that we want to be able to move into brand new industries like media and publishing and consumer products . <p> Q : You took over Apple 's product development about two years ago . That was a controversial move because many people thought you were n't qualified . How has that worked out ? <p> A : A lot of people thought that was a pretty outrageous thing to do . But I feel pretty good about what we 've done . We put in a whole new approach to cut development time in half . <p> We went on to a strategy that was more like how you would build a product in the movie industry , as opposed to how you would build a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products . " In the movie industry , if you have hit movies , you do really well . If you have average movies , it 's a horrible industry . And the same is turning out in this industry , so we made a lot of changes in the products and price points . So now we 're getting much higher returns on our investment in R &D; spending . <p> Q : What do you think of the changes taking place at IBM ? <p> A : We look upon them very favorably . They 've said this is going to be a new IBM . They 've said they 're ready to completely rethink the businesses that they 're in . They 're moving more toward service and solutions . Now if you think back to what Apple and IBM are doing together , the foundation technologies that we 've decided to work on together are mapping perfectly with that kind of a world . <p> Q : IBM is n't the only company restructuring . General Motors said this week it will cut 74,000 jobs over four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A : We 're not in a recession . We 're in an economic restructuring . I mean that we 're in the post-superpower era . And the United States is a very large regional economy in a global economy and we need to make major structural changes as we shift from being alone at the top in an industrial age to one of several strong regional economies . <p> These are jobs that will never come back when the recession is over . And it is n't just General Motors . <p> The other part of it is that we have this huge debt overhang from the 1980s , where the economy was hyped , and there was really very little productivity growth . So we 're paying the price for all of the accumulation of debt of people who were hired into jobs where there were no productivity gains to support them . And so in the context of a world economy , we 're just not competitive . <p> Q : Apple restructured its organization in June ( The company laid off 1,560 employees ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : I think we have to take everything a step at a time . We do n't have any plans at this time for further layoffs . But this is a very fragile economy . <p> My sense is that we 're going to have to see a new era where government and business are going to have to get out of their adversarial roles . They 've got to figure out how to work together as the Germans do and the Japanese do , and most other industrial countries do . <p> Q : What should the government be doing ? <p> A : Well , first of all , the major role of the president is to set the agenda and then to communicate it . And I think it 's been a very confusing agenda , and the communication has been very confusing . I think the government waited much too long before it even acknowledged that there was a major problem in the country . <p> We 've got to put the middle class back to work . And I think the 1986 tax reform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the incentives for investment in small business , where all of the jobs were created in the 1980s . I think the administration has done a very poor job of communicating what the capital gains tax means . It has nothing to do with helping rich people . It 's all about having incentives for small businesses to go and make investments . <p> Then we 've got to get the incentives in place in the system , so that small business will want to invest . And then we 've got to get consumers to have confidence in the economy again . And I think the best way to do that is for the president and for business leaders to at least have some general agreement as to where the country is going . <p> One of the most astounding comments in my industry is that there is no measurable productivity increase from all of these computers that have been bought by white collar workers over the past 10 years  --  none . <p> So billions of dollars of computers have been bought , and we ca n't point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technology is bad . It 's that we 've mapped it on top of the old way of working . So business needs to look at new ways of behavior and working . Government needs to learn new ways of working with business . <p> Q : How do you think this restructuring is going to affect Silicon Valley ? <p> A : I think if you look at the mid- to late 1990s , California can be very healthy . <p> On the other hand , it does n't look like we 're going to come out of the downturn economically in this state for some time . I would guess that we will come out after the U.S. does as a whole . And I think that you 're going to continue to see that the cost of living and the expenses of doing business in this area for high technology are getting harder and harder to justify . <p> The things that will remain here will be largely research and development that can best be done here because of the networks of small companies and large companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less expensively , that do n't require very specialized technical skills , will migrate to other parts of the country . Q : Education is a core market for Apple . What 's your impression of the current state of education in America ? <p> A : It 's in terrible shape . We essentially have an education system that was designed to train people to go into a factory economy , where they would do jobs that were simplified to the lowest possible skill . So the education system was built around memorization . <p> It 's clear that in the 1990s and the 21st century , people are going to have to be able to think and make decisions and we 're competing with other peer economies where you have graduate engineers on the factory floor . <p> The problem is that most of the education reform efforts have focused on how you get money moved from one part of government to another part of government . The real issue is what goes on in the classroom . <p> Q : What role can Apple and other computer companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge is not to get people to remember more , but to get them to understand better . We 're just now beginning to be able to show what we can implement with technological tools . I think our interest at Apple is to be the provider of the instruments that will help educators and students create an entirely new kind of learning than what we have now .
