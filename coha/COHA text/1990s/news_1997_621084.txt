<p> Millions of investors are building their portfolios drip by drip . <p> Dividend reinvestment plans ( DRIPs ) are a cheap way to buy stocks because you purchase shares directly from the companies that issue them , usually avoiding a brokerage commission . <p> Once you 're enrolled in a DRIP , you can quickly build your account by automatically reinvesting the dividends into more shares . <p> Most plans let you add optional cash payments , sometimes as little as $ 10 or $ 25 , to acquire more shares than you could with dividends alone . Some plans even let you purchase stock at small discounts to market value . <p> To participate in a DRIP , you generally must own at least one share of the company 's stock in your own name . ( You ca n't keep it with your broker in " street name . " ) <p> DRIPs give you the benefits of compounding and dollar-cost averaging  --  investing fixed sums at regular intervals to smooth out the market 's highs and lows . <p> An estimated 3 million people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Charles B. Carlson , editor of the DRIP Investor newsletter in Hammond , Ind. , and author of several books including " Buying Stocks Without a Broker . " <p> Contributing to the growth of DRIPs is a bullish market , the growing number of self-reliant investors and the trend toward eliminating the middleman , especially in financial transactions , he said . <p> Consider Edward Moore , a Redwood City antique dealer who began using DRIPs about 12 years ago because he enjoyed doing it all himself . <p> " It 's almost impossible not to make money on them if you do what I do , which is contribute a set amount of money on a monthly basis , " said Moore . <p> " When the stock prices go down , you keep buying the same amount every month . When the price decreases , you 're buying more shares with the same dollar amount . When the price goes up , you 're making a good profit , " he said . <p> But DRIPs are n't for everyone . You need to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own . <p> And because it usually takes a lot of time to buy shares through DRIPs  --  up to eight weeks  --  they 're best for " buy and hold " investors who plan to be in the market at least five years . <p> " They 're not for people who want to buy and sell stock , " said Ken Janke , president of the National Association of Investor 's Corp . " They 're for long- term investors who want to accumulate shares in particular companies . " <p> TRADITIONAL DRIPS <p> Investors can choose from two types of DRIPs : a traditional DRIP or a Super DRIP . <p> With a traditional DRIP , you must buy your first share of a stock by using a broker or by enrolling in a direct stock purchase plan . <p> If you use a broker , Carlson recommends sticking with a discounter such as Charles Schwab &; Co. , Jack White , or National Discount Brokers . <p> Direct stock purchase plans are offered by the NAIC in Madison Heights , Mich. , and Temper of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers DRIPs from 160 companies . To enroll you must be a member of the NAIC ( dues are $ 39 a year ) and pay a $ 7 service fee for each company in which you buy stock . <p> Temper offers DRIPs from 900 companies . To enroll you must be a member of Temper ( dues are $ 45 a year ) and pay a $ 15 to $ 20 service fee for each stock you buy . <p> Once enrolled , your dividends will be automatically reinvested , and you can make optional cash investments , usually on a weekly or monthly basis . <p> Some DRIPs charge fees every time you buy or sell shares , and a few allow automatic monthly transfers from your bank account to buy more shares . <p> Most plans require you to own at least one share , but some require several shares to enroll . <p> SUPER DRIPS <p> The second type of DRIP is known as a Super DRIP . Carlson also refers to them as " DRIPs on steroids " or " no-load stocks . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share directly from the company offering the stock instead of going to a broker or using a direct stock purchase plan . <p> Some Super DRIPs require a minimum investment , but these requirements are sometimes waived if you agree to regular contributions . <p> Super DRIPs do n't have the kind of fees demanded by brokers or direct stock purchase plans . But many will sock you with other kinds of charges . <p> McDonald 's , for example , charges a $ 5 enrollment fee . For each additional purchase , there is a $ 5 charge plus 10 cents per share . And there 's a $ 3 annual account fee . <p> These fees can take a toll on small investors . Say you 've enrolled in McDonald 's Super DRIP and now want to buy another $ 100 in stock . It 'll cost at least $ 5 in fees , or a whopping 5 percent of your investment . <p> " It 's the worst deal , " said Vita Nelson , editor The Moneypaper , a newsletter published by Temper . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay a lot of commissions . " <p> But Carlson defended the fees , saying it costs companies between $ 12 and $ 17 per person every year to service Super DRIP accounts . <p> You 're also more likely to get a wider range of services with Super DRIPs , such as automatic monthly transfers from your bank account , an Individual Retirement Account ( IRA ) option and the ability to buy and sell shares via telephone , he said . <p> Despite the controversy , the number of Super DRIPs has been growing steadily . In 1994 just 52 companies offered Super Drips . Today , that number is 330 . Carlson predicts that up to 1,000 companies will offer Super DRIPs by next summer . <p> More companies are offering Super DRIPs to woo long-term investors , raise equity capital , and develop a closer relationship to shareholders , said Carlson . <p> " If you invest in McDonald 's , you 're more likely to buy a Big Mac instead of a Whopper , " he said . <p> ADVANTAGES <p> Some critics believe average investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds , which can provide instant diversification across several investment categories . <p> But Carlson argues that DRIP fees are lower than mutual fund expenses , DRIPs outperform mutual funds , and DRIPs are better for investors who like to make their own decisions . <p> " Mutual funds are fine for people who do n't want to spend a lot of time on their investments , " he said . " They 're training-wheel investments . " <p> DRIPs also give you control over capital gains , and hence your tax bill , because you decide when to buy and sell . With mutual funds , the fund manager decides when to buy and sell , generating tax liabilities for shareholders , said Nelson . <p> If used correctly , DRIPs can provide good diversification , she said . Temper recommends enrolling in about 10 different kinds of DRIPs including plans offered by drug , technology , energy , utility and retail companies . <p> " We notice that people who were invested in only one stock or in only one industry would buy when the stock price was high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst times , " said Nelson . <p> " If they 're diversified , investors tend to be able to control their emotions because one industry will provide a buffer against losses in another industry , " she said . <p> DRIP RESOURCES <p> . <p> PRIVATE GROUPS <p> * National Association of Investor 's Corp. : The NAIC offers a service that helps you buy single shares of 160 companies and sign up for dividend-reinvestment plans .
