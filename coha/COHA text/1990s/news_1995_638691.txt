<p> CATHARINE Fogg had come home . <p> It was 1992 and China and the United States had agreed that some of China 's mineral potential could be surveyed by the U.S. Bureau of Mines . <p> When the survey work began , it must have come as quite a surprise to the Chinese to discover that the study 's U.S. scientist was not a grizzled miner , but Fogg , a diminutive Chinese-American woman with lively eyes and a vast knowledge in minerals . She also was fluent in three Chinese dialects . <p> A native of Shanghai , where she was born in 1935 , Fogg not only could communicate easily and accurately with mining officials but also could read technical documents effortlessly . Though there are few women in mining in China , she earned respect and cooperation . <p> " The Chinese were quite amazed that I could speak and read Chinese so well after being gone 40 years , " she said . <p> Her grasp of Chinese language and culture are excellent , but her concerns are all American . Fogg has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Denver chapter of the Organization of Chinese Americans , and president of the Asian/Pacific Women 's Network of Colorado . She is head of the Rocky Mountain Chinese Chamber of Commerce , on the Denver Mayor 's Asian Advisory Council and the Colorado Women 's Economic Development Council . In August , she attended the International Women 's Conference in Beijing with a League of Women Voters group . <p> Three years ago , when she did her five weeks ' research in China 's remote mining areas , there was very little information gathered on the six study minerals - titanium , phosphate , aluminum , copper , gold and fluorspar . <p> " Much of what Catharine got would have been considered state secrets not too long ago , " said Jon Stone , her superior and chief of the Minerals Availability Field Office for the U.S. Bureau of Mines . " The Chinese are in a part of the world that is extremely difficult to get information from , but they are beginning to be aware of the importance of getting international funding , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Catharine is dogged to stay at it to get what she needed . She has a very significant dedication to doing her job well . " <p> The report , written with three other authors from the bureau who did not go to China , was released early this month and will be used to help assess how the minerals may be used in the future , and to encourage trade and exploration of those minerals . <p> Ironically , the 85-year-old Bureau of Mines where Fogg had worked since 1981 is the first statutory agency to be targeted for closing by the current Congress ; it is to be disbanded by the end of the year . Stone added that Fogg , who retired last year because of cancer but is doing well now , has been a source of great strength and inspiration to her former co-workers , whose career futures are unknown . <p> Stone also praised her commitment to helping women , particularly Asian , but all women , often mentoring them in summer programs . " I was lucky to inherit an office that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 've benefited from that , " he said . <p> " She really cares about them and encourages them when it 's needed . She was a leading force when she was here , and has n't forgotten us . Catharine is one helluva lady . " <p> FOGG 'S father owned a pharmacy and in 1948 moved his family to Hong Kong , where he had a wholesale chemical business . As a schoolgirl , Fogg wanted to be a pharmacist like her father . She graduated from high school in Hong Kong , at age 17 went to preparatory boarding school in Brighton , England , and then London University to study biology . " It 's easier to study chemistry when there are universal symbols ; language is no handicap , " she said . In 1955 , she transferred to Washington University in St. Louis and graduated in 1958 with a bachelor 's degree in chemistry . <p> In 1959 , she married Ka Lun Fogg , a Hong Kong native who graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in engineering and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time there was a quota of 100 Chinese ( immigrants ) for all the United States , but you could stay if you worked for a defense company . Ka Lun came to Denver to work for Stanley Aviation , and I worked at the University of Colorado Med School with Dr. Theodore Puck on genetics , " she said . <p> She next earned her teacher 's certificate so she could substitute teach after her three children were born . Her parents came to the United States when her first child was born and lived in New York until retiring in Denver . Fogg estimates that 6,000 Chinese live in Colorado today . After her father died , her mother , Ching Wun Zan , moved to Sakura Square . Her only sister , Mary , three years younger and a nun at Mercedarian Missionaries of Berriz in Taiwan , is retired from teaching college English and comes to visit occasionally . <p> The Foggs ' children reflect their parents ' respect for education . Dennis , 35 , a graduate of the University of California at Berkeley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the technical staff for Synopsis , a software company . Elaine , 33 , also graduated from Stanford and Berkeley and is an electrical engineer for AT &T; in Denver . She and her husband , John Mah Jr. , have the Foggs ' only grandchild , 18-month-old Brandon . George , 27 , graduated from Cornell University and is a medical student at Washington University . <p> WHEN George went to the first grade , Fogg was ready to go back to full-time work , so she looked for a job on the west side to be close to home . She worked for U.S. Geological Survey for five years , primarily dating rocks for mineral deposits , with much work on uranium deposits in Wyoming . Her first return to China was in 1980 for the USGS to evaluate oil and gas projects . <p> Fogg said her career experience has made her an advocate of girls taking science and math classes : " There are wonderful opportunities in math and science , and young women need to be aware of them . It 's always easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have math and science skills , you get respect in the workplace , too , and you make more money . " <p> To broaden her own skills , Fogg went to the Colorado School of Mines , taking technical mining and metallurgical courses . In 1981 , she began working for the Bureau of Mines , hoping , because it studied mineral supplies worldwide , that she would do more projects with China . <p> " Catharine and I started working within a week " of each other , said Cathy Kilgore , deputy chief of the Minerals Availability Field Office . " We were the only two professional women in the office . She was a bulldog on projects and worked well on teams . We have some very difficult people , and when Catharine worked with them , she always won them over to work well as a team . Professionally she 's not one to back down . " <p> Kilgore noted that many co-workers were near the age of Fogg 's children , and so she tended to be " very motherly , always looking out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , urging us to do more , to reach farther . " She giggled at a memory , then added , " Whenever anyone got married , we 'd say , ' Catherine 's done it again ! " ' <p> Both supervisors noted that Fogg is never intimidated . Fogg herself says that 's probably because she was such a tomboy in Shanghai . She raised silkworms as pets and climbed many a mulberry tree to gather leaves to feed the voracious worms . <p> " I was always outside playing with the boys and competing with the boys , " she said . " In elementary school we only had one ping-pong table and the boys would n't let the girls play so the minute the recess bell rang , I 'd be the first one out , and sit on the table , and the boys had to let the girls play , too . " <p> ATTENDING the International Women 's Conference , with her focus on economic development , gave her insight into the lives of women around the world . Chinese women seemed to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college is strictly by highest score , whether you 're male or female , she said . <p> Some of the newer nations , such as South Africa , and some of the older - Sweden and Norway - all have a higher percentage of women in government , because their constitutions stipulate that a specific number of women must be nominated . She was surprised by the numbers of Islamic women at the conference , a reflection that they are increasingly working in jobs outside the home . <p> Fogg was most intrigued by women from Japan and their challenge in today 's society . <p> " The Japanese women are very interested in the way women work in other countries . Lots of Japanese women work , but they have low-level jobs . The average Japanese woman works seven years , gets married and quits . ... They do n't get good training because supervisors assume they 're going to quit , and they do n't earn seniority . Now there are many single women who want to know how to advance in their careers . I suggested they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperative . " <p> She praised the many stimulating exchanges at the conference . " It was rewarding to see women from all over the world and network with them . Some worked very hard and saved a long time to come . The level of intelligence and energy was just tremendous , and nobody was shy . Conversations were great . " <p> Her son Dennis went along on this trip , her third to China , and they went sightseeing for three weeks afterward . " He really appreciated my language skills when we traveled , " she laughed . She speaks Mandarin , spoken most often in Beijing , Cantonese from Hong Kong , as well as the Shanghai dialect . Her other two children visited China on summer student exchange programs , but none speaks Chinese . <p> SHANGHAI and its bustling economic development potential fascinate Fogg . Her memories of living there as a child during and after World War II are n't particularly traumatic : " We had to bow to the Japanese soldiers , and we paid school tuition with a ton of rice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Shanghai had a ' traitor ' who negotiated with the Japanese , and a puppet government , we were n't bothered too much . " <p> When she first returned to Shanghai in 1980 on the USGS oil and gas project , she saw little change . Today Shanghai booms , regaining its lustrous international status prior to World War II . " It 's energetic , growing , with room to expand , " she said . " Shanghai is very adaptive to new ways , overcomes obstacles and regulations . It 's the nation 's financial center like New York City , while Beijing is the government center . " <p> Fogg thinks Shanghai 's booming economy might offer business opportunities for Colorado . Industries such as biomedicals , cable television and high-tech companies have all expressed interest in possible connections . " I want to see information exchanged , networking and actual business deals . There should be joint ventures and partnerships , " she said . <p> To facilitate such exchanges , Fogg and the Rocky Mountain Chinese Chamber of Commerce are arranging a conference on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fogg was honored this year for her efforts by the Asian/Pacific Women 's Network of Colorado when she was presented with the Asian Women of Achievement Government award . <p> The joy of being " retired " is that you get to do what you want . For Fogg , that 's spending more time with her husband , who is retired from Martin Marietta , and with her small grandson . While her husband is a competitive tennis and badminton player , she hikes every Tuesday with a Boulder group and in the winter skis weekly with the Over the Hill Gang at Copper Mountain . She also volunteers Thursdays at the Denver Public Library downtown , helping users find their books or material on the computer . <p> Stanley Pouw , an Indonesian-born Chinese who 's been an architect in Denver since 1971 , and is chairman of the Mayor 's Asian Advisory Council , said Fogg is astute on many issues . " In Asia people work to raise money for themselves and not do much beyond that . It takes real work to get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making money . Catharine has been very active in being part of the larger Asian community , in volunteering and participating in many projects . <p> " Denver has an extraordinary richness of diversity within one city . ... It 's essential for Chinese and other Asians become part of it , and Catharine certainly does . " <p> Asked why she became so interested in community efforts , Fogg suggests that it probably is because she went off to boarding school at 17 , and then came to the United States as an undergraduate . " I came here so young and lived in a dorm with American students , and I adopted the American way of life . That 's in contrast to Chinese students who came for graduate degrees and stayed within the Chinese community for friends , " she explained just before rushing off to a Bronco game . <p> Much as she loves America , Shanghai keeps that special luster of " hometown , " and Fogg is eager to see both native and adopted homelands get to know each other and prosper . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then back in ' 92 , and there were tremendous differences , in how people were dressed , how much more was available in stores , even a great difference in attitude . We may think there 's not much change , but when you see it over a span of years , it 's evident the momentum is very big , and there 's a great desire to open up to the world . I 'd like to help facilitate such exchanges and growth , and that 's why I hope our Doing Business with China meeting will be so helpful . " <p> Joanne Ditmer is a Denver Post staff writer .
