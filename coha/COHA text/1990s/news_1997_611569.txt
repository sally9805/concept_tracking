<p> The finance minister resigns , claiming obstruction of his efforts to make changes in the economy . The stock market promptly tanks , losing 4 percent of its value in a single day . International speculators , smelling an imminent devaluation of the national currency , launch a huge sell-off that brings yet more uncertainty . <p> That was the news last week in Thailand , the Southeast Asian kingdom that in some recent years has been the world 's fastest-growing economy and now , incredibly , finds itself fighting off what some people fear could be a Mexico-style meltdown . <p> It would be a parochial tale of boom and bust , were it not for the fact that the factors driving the slide are found in varying degrees in China and many of the smaller " tiger " economies of Asia : surplus production capacity , workers without necessary skills , corruption , a financial system loaded with bad loans , dependence on fickle foreign capital . <p> So , as the region waits to see whether politics will harm Hong Kong 's prosperity after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes also are on Thailand , where the potential causes of economic grief are more conventional , and in some cases may be containable . <p> In recent weeks , central banks in the region have stepped into currency markets to buy the Thai currency , the baht , in huge volumes at times when speculators are selling it and driving its value down . <p> The lesson Thailand is illustrating : By throwing open the gates to foreign investors , developing countries often can achieve growth rates otherwise out of their reach . But they often embrace this money with little understanding of how quick foreign investors may be to run away . <p> These computer-savvy profit hunters comb the world in search of better interest rates , cheaper labor and a host of other things , and they swiftly punish inefficient markets or economic missteps . <p> In Bangkok , a traffic-clogged city of chic stores and sidewalk hawkers , the evidence is easy to see . <p> Above the bustle of the streets , the skyline is filled with half-finished skyscrapers and empty condominiums and office buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are n't getting paid are an increasingly common sight . <p> Bankruptcies and bounced checks are up . The nation 's largest finance company , Finance One , is awaiting a government bailout . And many other financial institutions are in such bad shape that a top banking executive told the Bangkok Post newspaper recently the government 's decision to force disclosures of bad loans could send many financial institutions into bankruptcy . <p> After many years of annual economic growth topping 8 percent , the rate is expected to fall sharply this year , as exports suffer from soft demand in Europe and Japan and exchange rates make Thailand 's products more expensive abroad . Jardine Fleming Thanakom predicts an economic growth rate of 2.9 percent , while Credit Lyonnaise Securities ( Asia ) Ltd. forecasts that the economy will actually shrink . <p> This is all very bewildering for Thailand . <p> For most of the past decade , its technocrats have been widely praised for transforming this tropical Asian nation from an economy of rice , pineapples and teak into a major manufacturing exporter . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward foreign investments . In the late 1980s and early ' 90s , these policies helped lure many Japanese manufacturers who were looking for a cheaper place to assemble products such as radios , fans and automobiles . U.S. companies , such as Seagate Technology Inc. , a California-based maker of computer disk drives , also have set up plants here . <p> As Thailand entered the ' 90s , the technocrats looked for a second act , and decided to make a grab for financial services companies . Many figured that after the Chinese takeover of Hong Kong , foreign financial companies would be scrambling for a new location for their Asian regional operations . <p> So Thailand removed decades-old regulations on its sheltered capital markets . It established the Bangkok International Banking Facility , which gave Thai companies easy access to overseas money . But at the same time that it liberalized controls , it kept the baht pegged to the U.S. dollar . To keep the exchange rate between the two currencies steady , Thailand had to maintain high interest rates for borrowing bahts , which meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result was that you had excessive borrowing , most of it in dollars , " said Daniel Fineman , a Bangkok-based analyst with Jardine Fleming Thanakom . Much of the money went to open factories that now are in trouble . " The whole economic landscape here is littered with examples of bad investment decisions . " <p> Thailand is awash in an excess of phone lines , as well as petrochemical , steel and cement plants . It has way too many buildings . Bangkok Land Public Co. , one of Thailand 's largest developers , spent $ 1 billion constructing Muang Thong Thani , touted as the world 's largest private residential and commercial development . It remains more than half empty , as do many other buildings here . <p> As overseas investments flooded into Thailand , officials seemed unable to manage the shift . Accustomed to supervising a cozy industry of 15 Thai banks , it failed to create the kind of sophisticated rules and structures needed to supervise the whirlwinds of global currency movements . <p> Meanwhile , wages rose , significantly outstripping those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making shoes , textiles , clothing and other low-tech goods were no longer so attractive to foreign companies . <p> " Most importers of cheap , labor-intensive products , such as footwear and apparel , move from country to country , following labor costs , and they will switch for just pennies , " said Raymond Eaton , chairman of Integra Group , a Bangkok-based trading company . Most Thai manufacturers failed to improve their productivity or the quality of their products and thus lost business to competitors in lower-wage countries . <p> The government , too , failed to make social investments needed to move the country into the industries that consistently can pay the higher wages Thai workers have come to expect . <p> The educational system , established for an agrarian Thailand , is n't turning out enough engineers or middle managers for the nation to " trade up " to higher-tech enterprises such as computer chips and software , as countries such as Taiwan and South Korea have done . Most Thai youths do not even attend high school . <p> The government also fell behind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign business executives here complain it takes an hour to make their way through the Bangkok airport , while they can zip through the Singapore airport in 20 minutes . Complaints abound about Bangkok 's traffic jams , which can double or triple the time it takes to get to meetings . Plans to build a new airport and mass transit systems are years behind schedule . <p> Foreign businessmen also say they are fed up with the corruption here . A scandal last year over the near failure of a big lender , the Bangkok Bank of Commerce , amid allegations of high-level corruption , raised concerns about the true health of the financial system . Likewise , a scam in which Thai exporters loaded boxes with rocks and garbage to inflate export figures and receive additional rebates , prompted analysts to question the true level of exports . <p> Foreign companies in Thailand , weary of the worsening economy , are beginning to complain about the Thai customs officials who hold up shipments until they get payoffs . " When the economy was booming , I would point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say , ' Oh , that 's the Asian way . ' But now they say , ' Oh , corruption ! ' " said Anant Kanjanapas , head of Bangkok Land . <p> Now an increasing number of economists and exporters are urging the government to devalue the Thai baht . That would lower the price of Thai goods to foreigners , stimulate exports and allow the government to lower baht-based interest rates . Interest rates top 13 percent , a level that business executives say is suffocating the economy . For instance , Anant said he has a number of potential buyers for his Muang Thong Thani condominiums , but few customers can afford mortgage loans at those rates . <p> The problem is that devaluation could send the country into a severe recession . If it took more baht to buy a dollar , Thai banks and other companies that hold dollar loans would have trouble meeting their payments . That could send the Thai financial system crashing , and create more cash flow problems for a host of industries . <p> Already the weak banking sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conglomerate , Alphatec Group . Alphatec was attempting to create a computer chip industry in Thailand . <p> But earlier this year Texas Instruments Inc. pulled out of a $ 1.2 billion microchip joint venture with Alphatec . Thai funding sources dried up due to the weak banking environment , said Alphatec Chairman Charn Uswachoke . <p> Charn also had to delay an initial public offering for another company in his group because the stock market was down . <p> Thailand 's automobile industry , seen as one of its brightest emerging industries , also has been hurt by the weak financial sector . Auto sales in Thailand plummeted this year , in part because finance companies have cut back sharply on car loans . <p> The economic slump means many employers are cutting back on overtime pay . <p> " So even if a buyer can submit evidence of sufficient earnings last year , it does n't guarantee that he 'll have sufficient earnings this year , " said Junji Shibata , senior executive vice president of Siam Nissan Automobile Co . <p> The joint ventures producing Nissan and Mitsubishi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not optimistic . I think it will take at least three years , maybe four or five years for the economy to recover . " <p> Thailand is an extreme case , but not the only sign of weakness in Asia . China , for instance , has overbuilt many of its coastal cities . Japan is struggling to come to terms with a banking system burdened with hundreds of billions of dollars in bad loans after a real estate bust . And corruption in Indonesia continues to discourage would-be investors . <p> So countries are watching closely how Thailand 's recovery progresses . On Friday the government made a stab at restoring stability , quickly appointing as finance minister Thanong Bidaya , president of one of Thailand 's larger banks , the Thai Military Bank . Thai stocks rallied Friday and Monday .
