Inventions can find applications quite different from what the inventor had in mind . . . <p> I would have got around to him all by myself , sooner or later . I 'd promised to do that , and I 'd made the promise to myself . It is not a good idea to break a promise you make to yourself ; it might just start you thinking that you 're not trustworthy-which is harmful to your mental health , whatever it may be . Roubor Transic , that unpleasant fellow , was definitely going to be a target marked For Destruction by Gerald Knave : Survivor-sooner or later . After all , the man had made his hobby into a very high-paying living , and his hobby was torture . Something , clearly , had to be done . But before I got around to it on my own-well , I 'd been busy-Marechal Field ran into me . He 'd planned to do that , and he 'd left his home planet , and all the lovely surroundings to which Marechal Field and all his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 'd been clearing up a small matter for an old-almost a senile-friend . I 'd been staying at a decent hotel in Barra , which is the planet 's one and only capital city , and I was not hard to find : why should I have been ? Marechal Field , fifty years old and an erect , soldierly figure of a man , with ice- blue eyes , large white mustachios and a shiny bald head , wasted no time at all in showing me the ransom note . It was short , to the point and almost completely unhelpful . Leave one million dollars in good metals in a locker in Gravesend Port . You will be watched . Do not set any guard on the locker ; or attempt to oversee it in any way . Whether or not you leave the ransom , your daughter Melissa will be RF turned to you . If you do leave the ransom , she will be returned alive , unharmed and in one piece . Roubor Transic " The torture business , " I said reflectively , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field grunted . " There 's no time , " he said . " I see that , " I said . Transic had written almost a generic ransom note : no specific locker named ( well , Field would , it said , be watched ) , and no deadline set for payment . Only the name of the victim had been filled in . " When did you find out Melissa was missing ? " I said . It did n't sound like a useful question , but you have to start somewhere . Field ignored it . " I called him , " he said . aI needed time to get the moneyto turn it into metals-so I called him . He was-my God , Knave-he was very pleasant . " " He has a lot of ways of getting rid of his aggressions , " I said . It was n't a bad setup for a ransom demand : leaving the locker number open meant that Field had to be absolutely certain he was being watched when he dropped off the money ; that got Transic better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could think of . And the open date put Transic in phone contact with Field without Transic 's having to initiate the call . " I suppose he did n't say anything incriminating over the phone , " I said . " He discussed the delivery of something for payment , " Field said . " I forget what . Oranges , I think . No , peaches . Oh God , he went on and on about how lovely this particular peach was . " That was Transic 's style : whenever you can safely stick pins in a victim , do so . " And you arranged a date , " I said . " I asked for ten days , " he said . " Transic gave me a week . I-I made arrangements immediately-and then I- " " You came to find me , " I said . " Maybe Transic had you followed every minute after the original note had been delivered . And maybe not ; no sure way to tell . Just by the way , how was the note delivered ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some postal office or other on the Reel . " Which was Transic 's planet of residence . All very simple , all very neatand as risk-free as a kidnap demand ever gets . " My God , Knave , " he said . " This is Roubor Transic . You 've got to help me . Melissa-she 's twenty-two , she 's just a kid . My God , Knave . A week with Transic- " " He wo n't harm her until day eight , " I said . " He wants his ransom-and he might be thinking ahead , to making a demand on someone else , somewhere else . So he 'd return the girl in good condition . " I was nowhere near as sure of this as I hoped I sounded , but Field nodded and looked a little relieved . " I suppose so , " he said . " Kidnapping-and the police can't- " " Once she 's returned , " I said , " she can complain to somebody . But it 's not likely to do any good . Transic will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolitho , or on Earth , or God knows where . " " But- " " Transic tortures people , " I said . " Lots of other people know about that , though he 's been careful enough to avoid arrest-so far . And being on the Reel , that odd so-called pleasure planet where money makes most of the laws , helps a lot . " He said it again . " But- " " A man who has a reputation for torturing people , " I said gently , " can usually scratch up people who will swear to anything he wants them to swear to . " Field sighed . I was thinking fast , but I tried not to let it show . " I suppose so , " he said . " Knave- " " Will I help you ? " I said . " If I agree , you 're going to have to help me . " " Money is n't important , " he said . " Melissa-my God , Knave , she 's just a kid . In Transic 's clutches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " She 'll be fine , " I said firmly . " And I was n't talking about money . I 'll need things from you . Supplies . This is n't going to be easy . " " But you will  --  " " I will , " I said . And felt doubtful about it , right then and there . Marechal Field was , as I may have implied , a very rich kind of fellow . He 's the Field of Field 's Fields ( try saying those six words five times fast without feeling like a damn fool ) , a company that might as well be alone in its area of expertise , small field work . Large fields-shielding for a building or a person or a ship , say-are common enough , but small fields are a little special : they 're the kind of thing that is perfectly possible in theory and only just barely possible in actual fact , for sixty or seventy perfectly good , and very lengthily technical , reasons . Field had found a trick or two for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , or one particular bit of your lab equipment-or , in fact , anything . He was working , he told me ( I talked with him for quite a while that day , feeling that , once I 'd agreed to help , the flow of conversation would keep him calmed down-and after all , we had to do something while he was on and off the phone ordering wooden crates and the latest in human-sized shields and so on ) - he was working , at any rate , on a fascinating notion : fields small enough to be used as lubricating tools . " We can wrap individual ball bearings , for instance , " he said . " The field can be beamed from a distance-about a quarter-mile is the beam limit-and the generating equipment weighs less than most lubricants , for complex jobs . Beaming equipment miniaturized , of course . " " But it 's got to be more expensive than lubricants , " I said . " Yes and no , " he said . " Power costs are minor . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak-the generator , suitably instructed , has a good lifetime . Specify your field , specify location and shape and strength , specify thicknessjust name it-and the generator 's good for fifty years before maintenance check , minimum . It costs more than a can of lubricant-but you never have to buy a second can . " " Even so- " I said . " The first sales are going to be to people rich enough to want the novelty , and boast about it , " he said . " People who want it for their cars or planesthe generator 's really lightweight-or for some household device like a Robbie , or any mech . " " And rich enough so they wo n't mind the price , " I said . " We think there are enough people like that to make quantity production feasible , " he said . " And that lowers cost-which means price will go down , in a couple of years , and we can realty start selling the thing . " It sounded as if Marechal Field was going to have a brand-new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A million dollars in ransom was a drop in the bucket . But Melissa Field was n't , in fact , all that safe in Roubor Transic 's hands . And I had said I 'd help out . And there was that promise I 'd made to myself , too . But , as I 'd also said , it was n't going to be easy . The first step was the delivery , as from a third party who had no known connection either to me or to Field , of a crate of chains and manacles-a big , expensive wooden crate , full of perfectly good , even showy equipment-to Transic . The second was a flat-out , open assault on Roubor Transic 's combination home , office and torture dungeon-his large manor house on the outskirts of one of the cities on the Reel . A brave , thorough assault by Gerald Knave . It failed , of course . I was shielded , but there are ways to get through any shield , and Transic , as any sensible person might have figured , knew six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was always possible that Transic would decide on the simple answer , and kill his assailant out of hand . In that case , of course , all my worries would be over , so I did n't waste time wondering about the odds . And , when you did think about it , the odds were in favor of the more complicated answer : Transic , after all , not only tortured people for hire-to extract information or to persuade them to do whatever it was the client wanted done-but as a hobby , for its own sake . He liked it . Torturing Gerald Knave seemed like his most likely aim-if , of course , he could capture Gerald Knave . I made my valiant assault , and the assault made my capture possible . It was n't an hour after the assault-my best guess ; when Transic got through my shield , unconsciousness was bare seconds away-that I woke up . My surroundings were not a surprise , but they were certainly a shock , to every available sense . I have not seen many torture chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows , where they 're sanitized . But this was the real thing . Transic was a traditionalist : the walls were stone , in large rough blocks , and the floor was stone too , with little gutters here and there to carry away whatever liquids were released when the place was in use . Lighting was electric , and not too dim-tradition is fine , but smoky torches are a damn nuisance to deal with , and half the time you ca n't see what you 're doing-and quite sufficient to show me a perfectly serviceable rack , a metal container on wheels filled with what I suspected were branding irons , an open closet full of whips and manacles , a knife or two lying around on the leather-covered benches-well , I wo n't do the whole list now , but none of it created feelings of delight in my bosom . The place echoed , and it smelled . Neither was a comforting fact , somehow . My mouth held a vaguely metallic taste I recognized as a very deep and basic fear . And I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on one of the benches , looking unharmed but somehow forlorn . I was chained and manacled to one of the uncomfortably rough stone walls , with a depressingly good view of the rest of the torture chamber . There is an ancient cartoon , apparently very popular away back before the Clean Slate War . In a way , it expresses the ancients " whole attitude as regards war and many other unpleasantnesses . It shows two men , both of them spreadeagled on just such a stone wall , hands and feet manacled , fixed immovably . One of them is saying : " Now , here 's my plan . . I was fixed exactly like the fellows in that cartoon , except that I had no company ; the chamber was empty . Now , I thought to myself , pulling against the chains and manacles and discovering that they had no more give to them than I expected them to havehere 's my plan . . . At that moment the door openedwith a faint creak he must have had specially built-and Transic came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against it , and looked across to me , on the right-hand wall . He smiled . " Greetings , Knave , " he said . " It 's quite a feather in my cap , getting you here . I wo n't say I hope you enjoy your stay , but I 'll say that I certainly will-and that it will be a much longer stay than you 'd like it to be . " His smile broadened ; he was actually beaming at me fondly . I was a feather in his cap , and he was going to be handling the feather very roughly . It was not a pleasant sight , that beam of his , any more than his speech had been a pleasant speech . His voice , for one thing , was a choked sort of tenor gurgle , of great volume but little precision ; he sounded as if he were always talking around an immense wad of something moist and sticky he could neither swallow nor spit out . And his looks gave me a notion of why he 'd taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round , exactly , but full of unexpected swellings and concavities here and there . He looked deformed , without my being able to pinpoint any individual , particular deformity : he looked , to put it very briefly , as if he were hunchbacked all over . He was not bald ; baldness would have been an improvement . Hair stuck out on his head , on his elbows , on what I could see of his chest ( he was wearing an open-shirted jumper , in traditional black ) , in discouraged little clumps . It looked like a pale-brown kind of weed growth . His eyes were a pale blue . All in all , I could read his history in his looks , or I thought I could . If he 'd looked anything like that during his formative years , every human he 'd come in contact with had either laughed at him or run screaming away . He 'd taken up torture as revenge on a race of beings who 'd treated him so badly . They do say that to understand all is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I understood what had made Transic what he was-or I harbored a reasonable guess at the notion-and the picture I had did not fill me with forgiveness . There was a little sadness for the unhappy childhood , but there was also the knowledge that there are , for six thousand reasons , a lot of unhappy childhoods-and comparatively few hobbyist torturers . Well , there we were , and there was nothing to do but play the scene out . " You 're going to regret this , " I said , and he beamed at me again . " I know I am , " he said . " I 'm going to regret its brevity . I 'd like to keep you here for-oh , say a couple of years . I understand you 're very fit and healthy-but I 'm afraid we wo n't be able to manage more than- , he reflected , grinning " - oh , say a week or so . " He took a couple of steps toward me . I did n't move-Hell , I was as fixed there as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " he said , beaming , " it will seem much longer . " I said : " It wo n't be a week . In fact , it wo n't be an hour . " " Bravado , " he said . aVery good , Knave . Very good , We 'll have to see how long the attitude lasts . " Then he stopped , apparently to think . " You 're here because of Melissa Field , are n't you ? " he said . " Why should I tell you anything ? " I said . He shook a finger at me . " Now , now , " he said . " In time-in a very short time , though it wo n't seem short to youyou 'll be ever so anxious to tell me all sorts of things . " " I doubt it , - I said . " Believe me , " he said . " But what 's the harm in your telling me that ? " None , of course . But I felt reluctant to do anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I happened to be on-planet , " I said , " and I thought I 'd drop in . Just by the way , where is Melissa Field ? I suppose you had her father followed when he left to see me . " " Melissa is quite safe , " he said , and the grin lessened by fifty percent . " A shame , really . I have been thinking-once I collect the money , why go to all the bother of actually returning the girl ? She 'd while away an interesting few days , I 'm sure-and I do hate to be at loose ends . Would you believe it , Knave ? When I dispose of you , there wo n't be a soul here except for me and the Field girl . " As I 'd thought , the torture business had hit a slow patch . " No servants ? " " All mechanical , " he said , with a faint tinge of regret . " They dragged you in and chained you up , of course ; I do very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow , God knows why . " You have no idea how hard it is to find good servants - servants who will respect your hobbies . " " I think I can guess , " I said . " But about Melissa Field " In a few minutes I 'll call them , and we 'll begin . Why be tiresome ? " he said , and shrugged . " She 's safe , and she 's somewhere about the place ; what more do you need to know ? She ca n't rescue you . In fact , nothing and no one can rescue you . " " You 're sure of that , " I said . " No one else is within a mile of my house , " he said . " Telltales inside would have told me if anyone except you had entered it . " " So we 're alone , " I said . He bowed again . " Quite . " " And if anyone came within a mile of this place- " " I would know at once , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crate full of equipment . " Field 's wooden crate , of course . I held my breath . " Rather a transparent ruse , though , " he said . " I did examine the nice chains and the manacles , and saw nothing wrong with them- " No surprise to me , as there had n't been anything wrong with them- " but I 'm sure they were gimmicked in some odd way or other . " He smiled . " If I 'd been such a fool as to use them on one of my subjects-on you , for instance- I 'm sure they 'd have broken , or dissolved , or somehow or other let you free yourself . " " Maybe they would , " I said , and tugged at my chains . Nothing moved . " So I did n't use them , " he said . UA very nice crate , though-I had my mechs put the whole thing in the basement-unopened and unused . Knave , I 'd thought better of you-it was much too transparent a ruse . " " Really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manacles , and landed on my feet , a foot or so in front of the stone wall . Transic was staring at me as if I 'd grown a second head . I gave him very little opportunity to think things over ; I got over to him in three quick strides , and hit him once , square on the button . He went down in an untidy heap , and he was a Hell of a job to drag to the wall and fasten to the manacles . There was , of course , nothing wrong with the manacles . Or the chains . Transic found that out when he woke up himself , a good deal less than an hour later . I had one problem , but I did n't expect it to be serious , and it was n't . God knew how his mechs were keyed for defense , if they noticed some stranger poking around the various chambers ; I needed to get in and out fast , and Transic was going to help me . I 'd dressed while waiting for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I started questioning him . I never had to use the whip I was holding ; I only had to finger it casually and look thoughtful . Torturers do not take well to even the threat of being tortured ; they feel they belong on only one side of that particular equation . The questioning period lasted about four minutes , and would n't have lasted that long if Transic had n't been so insistent about finding out how I 'd slipped out of the manacles on my wrists and ankles . " They 're built to close tightly , " he said , almost plaintively . " I 've used them so many times . . " It would n't have taken that long , either , if I had n't wanted the instruction codes for his mechs . He really did n't want to give those up , but the sight of that whip was too much for him ; he knew what it could do . And the manacles were just as good as he kept telling me they were . When I had what I needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't plan to be ; I was off-planet in an hour , and back on Bolitho , accompanied by a somewhat dazed but , thank God , wholly unhurt Melissa Field . I never did tell Transic how I 'd managed things . I did n't tell his mechs , either ; I simply reinstructed them . He 'll stay there , spread-eagled to his rough stone wall , for a time we might label as " Indefinite . " The mechs will feed him , keep him clean and reasonably healthy , and keep up the house itself . But I reprogrammed the recognition codes , and they wo n't treat him as Roubor Transic , nor will they obey any order he gives them . He 's Mr. X to the mechs , a casual human to be taken care of just as well as possible , but never , never released . I never told him a thing . But I 'll tell you-not that I have to , I should think . Marechal Field had buried a tiny transmitter in the wood of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Transic 's house was big ; it was n't that big . The transmitter beamed small fields around my wrists and ankles . That 's all . The fields were thick enough to make the manacles a very loose fit , easy as Hell to slip out of , I had to stay there by holding the things with my hands until I was ready to get out . And Field has gone even further . Every bit of my ship that called for lubrication , once upon a time , is now enfielded , and I own what may be the showiest ship anywhere . If people ask how I got it , I have a variety of tales to tell them . I have a few tales about Roubor Transic , too-when I hear somebody wonder why he has n't been heard from lately . They all have him going on a long , long trip somewhere . Why disturb the fellow ?
