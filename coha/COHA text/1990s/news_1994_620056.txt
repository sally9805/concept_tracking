<p> When Sprint Corp . bought La Conexion Familiar two years ago , it thought it acquired a gem : an upstart Bay Area company whose niche was selling long-distance phone service to Latinos , a fast-growing business . <p> Instead , Kansas City , Mo. - based Sprint wound up with a money-losing operation that it folded in July , abruptly putting 235 mostly Latino and female employees out of work . It also got hit with a 1,400-page lawsuit yesterday by the National Labor Relations Board for alleged unfair labor practices , one of the largest such cases in history . <p> For a company that likes to say its phone service is so good you can hear a pin drop , the fallout from closing the tiny subsidiary ( which generates less than 1 percent of its more than $ 12 billion in annual sales ) must sound like a ton of bricks falling . <p> It also is a stark reminder that the information superhighway  --  hyped for its technology  --  is still plagued by thorny workplace issues . This will continue : Once-secure jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone industry copes with deregulation , causing pain and stress among workers . <p> " I was in shock . Nobody expected it , " recalled Mayra Arriaga , when she and co-workers learned on July 14 that the San Francisco subsidiary would close immediately . " They told us to clean out our desks that day , because we would n't get to come back . One person fainted . " <p> The workload was quickly reassigned to other Sprint locations . Some workers complained about being searched as they left . Another who was n't at work received his personal belongings in the mail , minus a pair of sunglasses . <p> The closure of La Conexion Familiar ( Spanish for " the family connection " ) came one week before workers were set to vote on whether to unionize . It has left the nation 's No. 3 long-distance carrier , whose celebrity spokeswoman Candice Bergen plays politically correct " Murphy Brown " on television , open to charges of union busting and even racism . <p> The lawsuit , filed in San Francisco federal court , charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paints a picture of union activism  --  and despair by a company that is mostly nonunion . In April employees began signing union cards , and later about 100 of them came to work in union T-shirts . Sprint responded with perks of its own : T-shirts , raffles , promises of higher commissions , even free hot dogs . But it did n't work . <p> " Sprint tried to make La Conexion Familiar the first runaway shop on the information superhighway , " said Antonio Salazar-Hobson , a lawyer for the Communications Workers of America , which tried to organize the workers . <p> Sprint denies the allegations . " La Conexion Familiar was a horrendous financial disappointment , " said Vice President Wally Meyer . It never turned a profit and lost more than the initial purchase price , close to $ 9 million , since it was acquired . Meyer blamed intense , unexpected competition for Latino customers from AT &T,; MCI and other phone companies . <p> In the past year , La Conexion Familiar 's customer base fell by 60 percent to 80,000 customers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was projected to make a $ 7 million profit , he said . <p> The decision to shut the subsidiary had nothing to do with union activity , Meyer said . He added that it had been considered since a board meeting in May , prior to the filing for a union election . The plant was closed on short notice , he said , because managers felt it would get workers started on a full-time job search with some cash in hand . <p> All workers received severance packages , including pay and benefits that covered them at least to the end of this month . Sprint also hired outplacement firm Drake Beam Morin to help them find jobs . To date , about 30 workers have landed other jobs , while 70 are in vocational training . Meyer said workers ' pay and benefits had improved since Sprint took over the business . <p> HURT BY ALLEGATIONS <p> " We are deeply offended and hurt by the racial slurs and allegations made by the CWA , " said Sprint Vice President Jim Lewin . " Sprint has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commerce for its consistent support of the Latino community . " <p> But some former Sprint workers do n't feel the support . " It was hard to survive on my $ 7 hourly wage , but I was still making enough money to support myself , " said Alma Lopez , a laid-off single mother . " Unfortunately , Sprint shut down the company because we wanted to be represented by the union . I had to go back to the women 's shelter with my children . " <p> The workers say they know telemarketing is a high-pressure job , but they found some Sprint work rules onerous . Arriaga said she had to raise her hand like a child to ask for permission to go to the bathroom . Others charged racial insensitivity , such as being told they spoke " Hispanic , " not Spanish . Worker Nelly Choy said some workers were chided by management because they did n't speak English . <p> Meyer said he could not confirm the employees ' allegations . " We train our managers to follow the law , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different interpretations about what happens . " <p> PROBLEM CONTINUES <p> For Sprint , the problem is not over . The NLRB is seeking to force the company to reopen La Conexion Familiar and reinstate the workers . A federal judge is expected to hear the case next month . In a separate proceeding , a law judge for the board plans to hear the case on November 8 . <p> The CWA , which has tried for years to unionize Sprint without much luck , is using the episode to turn up the heat . The union exposed the recent firing of Sprint 's vice president for " fair employment practices " for allegedly falsifying a document submitted in the NLRB investigation . ( Sprint said the document has been withdrawn from the record . ) <p> In mounting a well-orchestrated public relations campaign , the union also is seeking support from Sprint spokeswoman and actress Bergen , although she is siding with her sponsor . <p> The CWA is n't confining its attempts to unionize Sprint to the United States . In Europe , where the company is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Deutsche Bundespost Telekom and France Telecom for $ 4.2 billion , the CWA has won local union support . " We are not willing to let anti-union endeavors of your company spread in our country , " said the German Telecommunications Workers Union . <p> Sprint is not anti-union , Meyer said . About 25 percent of its workforce is unionized , including some 6,000 represented by the CWA , he said . <p> QUESTIONING THE BOARD <p> To some , the dispute begs the question whether the NLRB will be neutral in the case . The board has taken a more activist approach under the Clinton administration . " We do not think the board is being impartial , " said Jeff McGuiness , president of the business-backed Labor Policy Association . " Most complaints are directed at employers , not unions . " <p> Robert Miller , the board 's regional director , disagrees . He points to the enormous detail in the lawsuit , based on a seven- week investigation . " The recent investigation revealed that La Conexion Familiar engaged in very serious , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> THE PLIGHT OF LA CONEXION FAMILIAR <p> . <p> Sprint bought the Bay Area company in December 1992 . It targeted the Spanish-speaking community in parts of the West , Midwest and Southwest with the motto : " A Latino carrier by and for the Latino market . " Sprint closed the nonunion business on July 14 , citing steep financial losses . The Communications Workers of America charges the unit was shut down for union organizing activity . In a lawsuit filed yesterday , the National Labor Relations Board agreed with the union . It alleged more than 40 violations of labor laws . <p> Highlights of the suit : <p> * Company President Maurice Rosas , during dinner at The Fly Trap restaurant in San Francisco , said on July 14 that the business was closed for union activity . Rosas denies this . <p> * Fabricated evidence was submitted by a Sprint vice president to bolster its case before the labor board . The vice president was fired , and Sprint said the document was removed from the record . <p> * After Sprint bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws . Sprint sued to rescind the purchase . But it settled out of court with former managers in January 1994 , and retained control of the money loser . All employees became legally documented .
