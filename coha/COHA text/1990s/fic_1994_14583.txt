A traveler comes to the edge of a millennium , and spins a tale of hope and apocalypse for a land called America . A pilgrim 's solo flight in jazz time . The character is an androgynous soul , a battered survivor , a traveler in the middle of the road . The time is the near future , a blasted landscape . SCAR Light . The traveler appears , barefoot . We 're in the middle ages , see We 're in the spit-fire of a chaotic age Ai n't got to do nothin but look around And you 'll see Nothin but ash and crumble these days Some say it 's the mighty cataclysm I say it 's the whole goddamn world It 's got itself hooked Two in the mornin dry mouth hole in the gut HOOKED On pain and retribution what it 's got is a taste for blood It used to be better if it was somebody else 's blood The farther away , the less recognizable , The just plain SMALLER someone was The better Now it does n't matter As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you 'd call it a loss of conscience I think of it more as a natural state : Beat. you want somethin , you get it ai n't goin your way , you get it OUT of your way simple as that it 's fuckin remorse that 's kept us back all these years HALF OUR TIME We 've spent half our time Thinkin Bout the other guy Nothin but feelin sorry for ourselves Apologizin for things we ai n't even done It 's no wonder we got such a taste for blood We goddamn lost our PIONEER SPIRIT This land used to be Oh this land was : Un-broken The ribbon of it Stretchin curlin unwinding itself For miles and miles Without end Solemn , it was Kind of land 's forged in the fierce heat of war Merciless , unforgiving . There was a call come over this land In time past Shot out over prairie sky And the dirt of Abel Come into the earth 's skin Swift as Cain Sure in the claim That its deep cry of battle Could never leave place For surrender We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of it Keeps me AWAKE " You find yourself , colonel ? You find yourself ? " " How bout you , sergeant ? You seen where you 've been ? " I do n't got to tell you I do n't got to tell nobody We 're just pickin up dirt now All of us , warriors , pickin up Dirt You know when you start lookin at the ground ? How you get to fix on it with your eyes Fix on it Close Like you 're gon na let the particles in that strange earth Grab you by the hand , and take you Into their labyrinth ? DANGER lookin , it is Cause you ca n't stop your eyes once they 're fixed They 'll take you down N the further you go The further you see the ash n crumble Take you on past Until you are cock-sure you are in the ice age : Now , I do n't got to tell you it 's cold Just eyes and mouth peerin out from under " How 'd I get here ? " you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have sought so long now that I find myself here In this human-less Habitat ? " The sleepin silence of the ice do n't take long It drowns memory and light in its quiet But there is sound And that sound is a RACKET A clangin teropsicatin splendiferous roar Of bones bustin for air Disarmin for mercy So , you look up You look around You take your eyes Off The ground Do n't wan na give in to the ice Hell , that kind of peace is too much for human-kind You walk You stumble You trespass Forward Do n't look back Forward Do n't lose step Forward You come upon : What is it ? WHAT is it ? Science . The strangest of religions And yet there it is : Atoms , protons , the nucleus of a hundred million stars Rescued from eternal mystery By righteous human folly Oh it does move us It has made this un-broken piece of continent Uncircumscribed by definition Yet tiny Beyond reason CHAOS Silence . The stars hold secrets , make no mistake You wander up there long enough You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what they do tell : There was this green star Off to one side It came up to me one day It said " How come you got to KNOW so much ? What purpose is there to your knowin ? Is not the brutality of time enough ? " " No , " I said , " No . " And I KILLED THAT STAR I TORE OPEN ITS BELLY AND SUCKED OUT ALL ITS LIGHT " No . It is never Enough . " You see , I am a true citizen I am a soldier , a brave I ca n't stop myself from killin It 's all I got Beat . " Tell me , sir , what is the true price of knowledge ? " " To kill . " Yes . To kill And when I am dead and buried Who will comfort me ? Who will come And silence My dreams ? I think on this I think And I am shamed There is no comfort in waking thought No pleasure in killing A great hunger remains There is a scar in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorrow Repentance As if someone could hear it Pause . It 's a kind of delirium we 're in A half-crazed half-dazed perpendicular delirium A steady stream of fire Is our companion through day and night And all we do is stand still In its haze It 's enough to make the whole planet Jump off A roof But we stay on Some of us Stay We see no choice in absence Perpendicular We stand Drawing our swords Clinging to the earth 's face Aimin our metal At barely guarded foes It ai n't victory no more It 's blood Piss-red , common TAKE ME BACK To ice And stone TAKE ME I WANT TO FEEL Tender And in the Sweet hot Can you hear me ? How bout now , pilgrim ? What make you of this ? Is your skin jumpin out of itself ? ( sweet exhilaration ) ohhow weary you must be to be here I am cold sorry Pause . We 're in a god-less age , see Smack in the hollow of an unjust sky Strange wonder We 're still Then again Not strange We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we drink We 're still warriors somewhere . So , leave your mark Best to leave it It will be cut down Quick Tie the ribbon of road to your back There is only one road Between the earth and stars And if you do n't tie yourself to it You 'll fall Hard Tremble And see If you can Feel it A little I will pour salt on my scar Let it burn Perhaps Something will Heal I can remember a time I ca n't remember a time When everything ( every thing ) has been so small forgotten time and I got a taste in my mouth righteous . The traveler is standing . Lights begin to fade . The traveler turns slightly toward the light.
