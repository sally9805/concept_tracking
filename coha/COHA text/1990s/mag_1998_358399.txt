The genius of Christopher Keyser and Amy Lippman , the creators of Party of Five , has been to understand the entertainment value of emotional pain . The show is about a family of five orphans and it features enough heavy talk and tragedy to sustain an A.A. chapter . As presented by Keyser and Lippman , though , the relentless suffering is positively enjoyable . That is so partly because Party of Five offers the guilty pleasure of watching other people 's troubles , but the show is much finer than any soap . When the competence of Julia ( played by Neve Campbell with sensuous innocence and gravity ) wounds her ineffectual husband , the moments are pointed and true . Keyser and Lippman produce a discerning weeper , and it has found a large , passionate audience . <P> And that is the team 's problem . Having achieved one success , the two face the oldest and most dreaded question in show business : What can you do for an encore ? Their answer comes on March 11 at 9 p.m . E.T. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five , it is an ensemble drama about young people . This time they are a group of friends in their 20s . The show 's tone is much lighter and more romantic than Party of Five 's , but it still has its share of anguish . Expectations are high , and if the show is a hit , it will prove that Keyser and Lippman really have the goods . <P> Three years ago , when Party of Five was struggling , it seemed unlikely they would even be employed , much less have two series on TV . Keyser , 37 , and Lippman , 34 , met in 1985 in a playwriting class at Harvard , where he was in law school and she was an undergraduate studying poetry . Uninterested in a legal career , Keyser began writing screenplays after graduation ; meanwhile , Lippman became a writer on soaps . They linked up officially in 1988 , when they both moved to Los Angeles with their future spouses . They have been partners ever since , and their closeness is apparent in how they finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When we 're done fighting , " says Lippman , " we go out for a great lunch . " <P> After writing for such shows as L.A. Law and Sisters , Keyser and Lippman were asked by Fox to develop a series about some kids on their own after the death of their parents . Early on , the show had few viewers and was almost canceled . To help the ratings , Rupert Murdoch , whose company owns Fox , suggested an episode in which the kids ' house burned down . ( Keyser and Lippman rejected the idea . ) Eventually , the ratings improved , and the show 's popularity continues even as the loss of the parents recedes . " These people at any time in their lives are constantly forced back to take care of each other , " Keyser says , " which is the original premise of the show . In this way , we bring the show back to its essential question . " <P> In the middle of last year , Keyser and Lippman started considering a new project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar show about characters in their 20s . The post-college years , when people are trying to figure out what they 're going to do with their lives , offered lots of dramatic possibilities . So they set about creating a group of characters : Campbell ( Eion Bailey ) , Henry ( Scott Bairstow ) and Nell ( Jennifer Garner ) , who have been friends for 20 years ( needless to say , Nell has been involved with both guys ) . They live in Los Angeles , professionally and romantically adrift .
