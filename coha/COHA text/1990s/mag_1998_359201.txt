Mark McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr .  --  are they ready to hit ? I do n't mean ready to meet the fastball with the fat of the bat . We know they can do that . I mean , are they ready to hit and land their feet as American icons ? Can they live forever in the records of the game  --  and survive this year ? Can they bulldoze into the Hall of Fame and worm their way into our hearts ? What price will they pay for their place in our small pantheon of power heroes ? <P> We marginalized and embittered Hank Aaron  --  put him in statistics books , used him for a million video clips , but still ca n't quite forgive his breaking Babe Ruth 's record for career home runs . Roger Maris ? We killed him . First we made him bald and drove him out of New York , then out of baseball . And soon he was gone . They called it cancer , but we know it was the asterisk . <P> Griffey and McGwire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too much jostled , pressed or in pain , they will surely fall short of glory . But if they 're seen to care too much for themselves ... well , Ty Cobb is in the Hall but not in our hearts . There are no selfish American heroes . <P> McGwire and Griffey will be asked about hitting until the subject is like chalk in their mouth ; each will be asked about his childhood and diet , race relations and Monica Lewinsky . To hit 62 , each man will have to want it so much that he can wall it all away . Yet if he seems to wall us out , we 'll fix him with a mortal disdain that will outlast any record he can set . Even so , Griffey and McGwire could make it to the record and beyond , to that Elysian realm where a man seems to stand for something good about the nation and the age . They could achieve that titanic Ruthian grace because of who they are , and who we are , right now . <P> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . It 's how we 're good when we 're very good  --  with overwhelming force . Our great cars are n't about engineering elegance . No , we start with a 490-cu. - in . V-8 . In combat , from the Civil War to Desert Storm , we bring to bear massive , ineluctable power . If that approach ca n't be done ( Vietnam comes to mind ) , that 's not a good American war . <P> That was the glad nerve Ruth palpated . When he showed up with his superfluity of power , the apparently effortless capacity to render moot all the niggling fine points of the contest , the game was instantly changed . The bunt , the stolen base , the Baltimore chop were back-burnered for decades . Ruth 's brash Yankees went to the 1923 World Series against the New York Giants , the classiest tacticians of their day . The series went to six games , but the Babe poled three into the right-field seats , and the Yankee dynasty had begun . Heywood Broun spoke for millions of delighted fans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shall prevail . " <P> Ruth found a match between his enormous appetites and the national agenda . America had made the world safe for democracy . We were rich . We were strong . In the ' 20s we were ready to play , with truly American force . While the market soared , we knew God loved America and sent us the Babe to prove it .
