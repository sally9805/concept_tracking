For two days last week , the Croatian city of Knin was drenched in a fiery rain of artillery shells , mortars and bombs . The self-styled capital of Krajina , the stronghold of nearly 200,000 rebel Serbs who seceded from Croatia in 1991 , found itself the focus of a massive assault by the forces of Croatian President Franjo Tudjman . Within the first half-hour of the offensive , more than 200 shells fell on Knin . By Saturday panic had descended as well . As Croatian tanks began rolling through the streets , Knin 's Serb leaders placed a last-minute call to the U.N. , requesting the evacuation of 32,000 civilians . Then the leaders themselves joined the long line of cars , trucks and buses streaming in the direction of northern Bosnia . Around noon , an enormous Croatian flag , whose red-and-white checkerboards have long served for Serbs as a hated symbol of Croatian rule , was hoisted above Knin 's 10th century citadel , once used as a coronation site for medieval kings . <P> And then Knin appeared to give itself over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The streets were deserted , apart from scattered corpses and rescue vehicles scavenging about like small birds . Abandoned by the losers , as yet unoccupied by the winners , the city seemed lost in its pause , as if reflecting on the raw brutality with which the victors had smitten the vanquished . " Almost the only people remaining , " said Major Alan Balfour , a U.N . spokesman , " were the dead and dying . " <P> In the Balkans , there is now a whole new war to die in . Four years after a humiliating defeat , the Croats are on the move with a well-trained , well-equipped force of more than 100,000 . That is the largest army to fight in Europe in 50 years . There is a risk that the battle for Krajina will spin out of control and engulf the Balkans in a wider war , one that could conceivably draw the republics of the former Yugoslavia , as well as their European and American allies , even further into the conflict . At the same time , however , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Croatian offensive succeeds , a balance of power will be achieved and four years of Balkan butchery will come to an end . In any case the Balkans have entered a new phase , one in which the fighting and the killing may for a time be more intense than they have been since 1992 . <P> For weeks Tudjman 's generals had been massing troops around Krajina , threatening to retake the breakaway province unless the Serbs agreed to rejoin Croatia . Then three weeks ago the Bosnian Serbs began attacking Bihac , a pocket bordering Krajina and controlled by the Muslim-dominated Bosnian government . The Croats helped the Bosnian Muslims and took two towns in Bosnia controlled by the Serbs . Following that action , the Croats seemed to gear up for a full-scale offensive . There was a brief moment of hope when the U.S. ambassador to Croatia , Peter Galbraith , announced concessions by the Serbs . The U.S. had been trying to broker a peaceful settlement . But the moment passed ; at 5 a.m. on Friday , the shells began falling on Knin. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
