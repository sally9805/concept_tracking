I WITNESSED THE BEATING of the cripples on my first day in Kinshasa . It was late morning in October , at the advent of the rainy season . Pale dust hung in the humid air . The flamboyant trees that line the old boulevards were powdered with tiny blue and orange flowers . After an early surge of noise and tumult , Zaire 's capital  --  colonial bungalows with rusting tin roofs and riotously overgrown gardens , soot-stained office buildings , a cinder-block shantytown sprawling endlessly through black dirt and iridescent greenery  --  had fallen into a lull . People sought the shade , and I came across the cripples , in a group of about twenty , lounging next to their tricycles . Kinshasa is full of cripples , which accounts in part for its medieval atmosphere , and many of them get about on oversize homemade tricycles ; a chain running up the front wheel to a sprocket on the handlebars enables them to pedal by hand . As I approached the cripples , something down the street suddenly caused them to panic . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on the seats , and pedaled past me , chattering frantically in Lingala , the dominant tribal language of Zaire . Farther along the boulevard , I found smashed tricycles lying in heaps , and beyond that wreckage , a dozen soldiers in olive fatigues were destroying more tricycles and beating cripples , shoving them , as they shrieked in protest , into two rusty vans . It was a disturbing , chilling incident , but I thought I understood it . I was in Africa , in Zaire  --  the heart of darkness  --  and what I was witnessing , I told myself at the time , was a scene of Conradian horror . Of course , I did n't understand it at all . The true explanation came that evening , and it was so unlike any I could have imagined that it not only demonstrated how poorly I understood the country I was in  --  it also made me wonder if , here in Zaire , I could trust my senses at all . A European expatriate I had met through mutual acquaintances had invited me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gombe district , where the generals , oil executives , and diplomats live . Domino 's was smoky and low-ceilinged and had an engagingly roguish armosphere . Secretive Lebanese diamond traders , itinerant Belgian engineers with handlebar mustaches , overmuscled South African security consultants , and exquisitely beautiful prostiutes all frequented the place . The prostitutes , who were extremely young , had gathered like a flock of exotic birds along a bar in the front . They had coltish necks and coffee-colored skin . They wore feahers and perfume , black dresses and gold jewelry , and as we made our way to the dining room , they preened , rustling and murmuring and pursing their lips , and stroked our ribs and thighs . " Tasty morsels , " the expat said . " But highly toxic . " The expat was an enjoyable character , candid and cynical . The African sun had permanently blistered his fair skin . He had been in Zaire for six years and had acquired a kind of fond hatred for the place . We took a table and ordered . I described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , you know , the cripples are very strong from the waist up  --  all they do is pedal , " he said . " They have these shakedown gangs . They go into shops and threaten to destroy everything unless they are paid off . Businessmen hire soldiers to protect them from the cripples . " Our food anrrved . The expat cut into his bloody steak and dipped the meat in mayonnaise . " A little while back , " he said , " the cripples tried to attack a businessman who was under the protection of the soldiers . The soldiers arrived and ffft , ffft "  --  the expat hissed twice and made a tossing motion with his arms  --  " threw the cripples over the wall . The cripples are not very heavy , since their lower bodies are atrophied . The leader of the cripples , who plays the guitar , wrote a song about the tossing of the cripples . He can be found near a restaurant this businessman favors . Now every time the businessman eats there , he has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them happy . " We burst out in laughter  --  the peculiarly explosive laughter of disbelief . So much , I thought , for Conradian horror . DISORDER BECKONS The late novelist John Gardner once said there are only two kinds of stories : A man goes on a journey , or a stranger comes to town . The latter is the account of an invasion . It begins when the wanderer 's shadow first darkens the doorway . But where does an adventure begin ? With the decision to make the trip ? The departure ? Or does it begin with the initial moment of dislocation , that first revelation of the strangeness of the strange land , the wanderer 's view through the doorway into an unfamiliar room ? In Zaire , my first view through the door , the real beginning of the journey , occurred with the revelation that the cripples , far from being persecuted and weak , were just as brutal as the soldiers , and , what was more , they both treated the violence as a joke . It was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Zaire . The country has always fascinated me . It is huge  --  as big as the United States east of the Mississippi  --  and rich in natural resources but arguably the single most corrupt place on the earth . Mobutu Sese Seko , who seized power after a coup organized by the CLA , has been systematically looting its treasury for thirty years . Government , as it is understood in most countries , has collapsed . It is no longer possible to drive from one end of Zaire to the other . Twice since 1991 , Zairean soldiers have gone on rampages . The country seems to suffer from some peculiar curse . AIDS may have originated in its eastern rain forest . Last year , the Ebola virus killed 244 people around the town of Kikwit . What , I had wondered for years , was this country  --  a place slipping almost visibly from the twentieth century backward into a world of banditry , abjection , and nihilism  --  actually like ? Last summer , Joshua Hammer , a Newsweek correspondent and an old friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning a trip up the Zaire River , famously known as the Congo , into the country 's interior . He would retrace the journey Conrad took in 1890 that became the basis for Heart of Darkness . " It 's the ultimate African adventure , " Josh told me . In the last year , I had turned forty and , after twelve years of marriage , separated from my wife . Africa 's wildness and disorder beckoned . " I 'll go with you , " I said . MONKEY MEAT Our plan was to spend some time in Kinshasa , then take a boat twelve hundred miles up the great mythic waterway to Kisangani , the setting both of Conrad 's Inner Station and V. S. Naipaul 's masterpiece on postcolonial Africa , A Bend in the River . From Kisangani , we would fly east to the town of Goma , the site of a huge refugee camp on the Rwandan border , and then back to Nairobi . The plan did have its uncertainties . The boat , which provides the only access to the interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a series of barges , supposedly made the journey once a month . It had only recently resumed scheduled trips afrer a three-year period during which , for murky political reasons , it had not run at all . It might not leave on schedule , or it might never leave . Also , no commercial airlines flew from Goma to Nairobi . We would have to hitch a ride with a relief flight . We arrived in Kinshasa late one afternoon in early October . What is most immediately striking about the city is its smell . It hit me , unmistakably , insistently , as soon as I stepped off the plane at Ndjili Airport  --  a ripe , sweet , cinnamon-like odor , a blend of woodsmoke , garbage , jungle decay , diesel fumes , rotting bananas , charcoal and ash , sweat , dung , and tallow . It is as strong and as unexpectedly aromatic as a good pipe tobacco , the smell of a place where people have no aversion to smell . What also struck me right away was the garbage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it is scattered everywhere , through the trees , along the rutted lanes , in every ditch and pool of standing water . Piles of massed garbage are aflame , and those fires , together with ones in cooking braziers in front of the tiny cinder-block houses , give the air a smoky , gray texture even when the sun is out . Kinshasa is a city slowly , continuously burning . After checking into the Inter-Continental , Josh and I drove down to the docks . Passengers waiting for the boat to leave had camped out on the pier . Children jumped over puddles , and chickens pecked at the loose grain spilling from the sisal sacks piled everywhere . A man walked past with the haunch of an antelope  --  bloody thigh stump , tapered leg , and delicate black hoof  --  slung over his shoulder . Another man , standing against a wall , had what I realized was a stack of monkey carcasses . Seeing me studying him , he approached and held the monkeys out . They had been gutted , their rib cages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried skin . " You want ? " he asked in French . I shook my head . " Why ? " " I do n't eat monkey . " " You do n't eat monkey ? " the man asked in amazement . " Why ? " My lack of interest angered him . He shoved the carcasses at me . " Why ? Why ? " My answer  --  that monkey meat left me a little squeamish because , for one thing , green monkeys are believed to be the original source of the AIDS virus and , for another , eating a primate seemed vaguely cannibalistic  --  was not one I wanted to share . The man spit in disgust and stalked off . We entered a dusty terminal . A clerk said he knew nothing of the riverboat 's departure and directed us to a nearby office building . We climbed four flights of stairs and walked down a dark corridor , peering into dim offices filled with idle people until we found a small man in a white shirt who said the boat needed repairs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fuel , so it would n't be leaving for another week . At least . THE ENTREPRENEUR The next night , Anatole , a driver Josh and I had hired , picked us up for a night in la cite , as Kinshasa 's shantytown is known . Both sides of Anatole 's Ford were dented , it lacked a front bumper , and one headlight dangled like an eyeball gouged from its socket . Because Kinshasa has virtually no functioning streetlights , the city is , except for the flickering trash fumes , strangely dark at night . The beam was dim on the Ford 's working headlight , the roads were crowded , and as we bumped along , pedestrians materialized in front of us out of the drifting smoke . When a white-helmeted policeman held up his hand , Anatole accelerated past him . " Never stop for them ; they only want money , " he said . Anatole spoke in a slurred rumble from so deep within his chest that it was difficult to understand him even if your French was perfect , and mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I asked . " Noone obeys the laws here . " We stopped at a house to pick up Gaston , a friend of Anatole 's and a producer at Voice of Zaire radio . Gaston , who was about thirty , had a handsome and intelligent face . His head was shaved . He wore a bottle-green double-breasted suit with the Enzo Galbatini label still stitched to the left sleeve . Like many Zaireans , he carried a cellular phone ( the regular phones almost never work ) , and as Anatole maneuvered the Ford through la cite , he worked it . " Serge , it 's me , Gaston . Are we on for Brazza " Gaston launched into a serious business discussion . " Bon . Call me back . " Gaston explained that he was paid only five dollars a month at the Voice of Zaire . What the job really offered was the opportunity to make money through connections . He earned a living as a freelance music producer . He and Serge , an agent , were setting up a recording session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Congo Republic . It was n't a great living , Gaston said  --  he ate only one meal a day , and his wife sold peanuts and beer out of their house for a little extra cash  --  but he was doing better than most . " We are all  --  what 's the word Americans like so much ?  --  entrepreneurs , " he said . For example , he went on , students at the university must pay their professors . But if the student pays , the professor must give him a good grade . Politicians pay journalists to have stories written about them , and journalists pay their editors to run the stories . Convicts do not serve prison sentences ; they are incarcerated until their families pay off the warden and guards . " Is n't anyone trying to change things ? " I asked . " Change ? " Gaston seemed genuinely puzzled . " There seems to be such a political vacuum , " I persisted . The government raised almost no revenues and provided almost no services . Everyone was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How could it change ? " Gaston asked . The subject did n't interest him very much . " No one can do anything . What is a man to do ? " This fatalism struck me as extraordinary . For all Zaire 's problems , the country was depoliticized . The people who lived there did not see its crisis in political terms ; they were unable to imagine a political solution . Gaston 's phone burbled . He returned to business , which , unlike politics , offered some small hope . " Serge ? So Brazza is confirmed ? " CELESTE Gaston took us to an open-air beer hall where the Amstel beer company was hosting a party to launch the sale of Amstel in Zaire . The hall ws bright and crowded . Waitresses in short Amstel-red skirts served free beer . We took seats in the balcony , and a friend of Gaston 's , a woman named Celeste , with doe eyes and soft hair , joined us . On the stage , a Zairean band played one of the driving , irresistible songs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Africa . At the front , four female dancers in leotards and leggings moved sinuously , snaking their arms and jiggling their buttocks at the crowd in a restyled rock version of African tribal dance . Two dozen European distributors sat at tables in front of the stage . One of them rose and gave a speech about the rich flavor and modest price of Amstel . Then , with the band playing again , two dwarfs in purple sequined tribal costumes began to dance . People in various states of inebriation sashayed up to the dwarfs and showered them with handfuls of the worthless Zairean currency . At one point , the European suits seemed to decide that this ritual was obligatory , for they arose en masse , encircled the dwarfs , and , acutely aware of how ludicrous they looked , cast multicolored bills over the diminutive performers . Throughout the dance , Celeste sat politely in her chair , nursing a beer . Now and again , Josh and I tried to engage her in conversation , but it was hard work . Outside afterward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said goodbye and disappeared . As we were getting into the Ford , the four female dancers walked by . Au revoir " we called . Au revoir " they replied . I could see by the yellow light from the beer hall that they were flushed from their exertion . The seams of their leotards were damp with sweat . One pushed her hair up off her neck . I leaned my head out the window  --  I had had my share ofAmstels  --  and shouted , " Les femmes danseurs du Zaire sont es plus belles dans tout le monde . " The perspiring dancers giggled and waved . I was n't even sure whether I had said what I had intended to say . " Mon francais est tres mauvais , " I told Gaston . " C'est vrai , " he said . " Vous ne conjuguez jamais . " We all laughed raucously . I was enjoying myself as much as I had on any occasion in years . The moon was full , giving the gutted lane a silver shimmer . As Anatole started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to take Celeste back to the hotel ? " THE MINISTRY It was just as well the boat was delayed , for Gaston and Anatole informed us that to visit the interior of Zaire , we needed permits from the Ministry of Information . The ministry was housed in a 1960s office tower . Made of pale-green stone , with portholes for windows , it had clearly been conceived as a tribute to the glorious future of African nationalism but was now in a state of stunning dilapidation . The driveway was blocked by the battered rim of a bicycle wheel , which a soldier , after checking our papers , solemnly removed . A reliable-looking clerk on the eighteenth floor told us we would have no problem securing the papers we needed , but when we returned the next day , he had disappeared . We came back on the third day and , after waiting for three hours , were shown into the office of the vice-minister . He had eggplant-colored skin and a dapper goatee . His navy blazer and gray-flannel slacks were freshly pressed . Josh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required in the past , " he said . " C'est vrai , " the vice-minister replied . His French was perfect . " In the past , there was a period of disorder , and people could travel anywhere without permits . But now we are restoring order . Permits are necessary . " The price , he said , was $500 . " We are here to write positively about your country , " Josh said . " Not about politics or economics but about the river , the people , the culture , the forests . " The vice-minister lit a Dunhill with a thin gold lighter . " Five hundred is for television crews . Since you are writers , the fee is $250 . " There was something preposterous and also exhilarating about haggling with the man ( the vice-minister himself ) over a minor bribe . I adopted a stern expression . " We simply do n't have that kind of money , " I said . " You misunderstand me . I mean $250 for the two of you . " Josh and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we watched a functionary fill out forms using carbon paper as ancient and frail as papyrus . The vice-minister opened his door . " There is a problem , " he told us . " I thought you were with the same organization . But you are with two organizations . " He gazed out the window , actually stroking his goatee as he turned the problem over in his mind . " This troubles me , " he said . After he lit a Dunhill and inhaled contemplatively , a solution presented itself . " Another hundred , " he said decisively , and strode into his office . THE PRISONER That afternoon , we learned that due to the scarcity of spare parts , the boat would not leave for still another week . I began to feel slightly confined in Kinshasa . What , I wondered , were the real prisons like in a country where nothing works ? I 'd also heard that a European was being held in a local jail until his ransom arrived , and I wanted to meet him . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Red Cross , told me when I contacted her . The following day , she took me out to Makala Prison . Part of the prison 's roof had collapsed , she explained on the way , but it posed no security problem . The prisoners who ca n't afford to buy their freedom rarely try to escape . If they do , the soldiers simply arrest a member of the prisoner 's family . And the people who live nearby exact their own brand of justice on escapees . Locals who had caught two men who had run awy earlier in the year had dragged them behind cars and poured diesel fuel into their ears . The prison , located in a field near a market , had a pocked , easily scalable wall and a metal gate of the type used to keep cows in a pasture . After a brief tour ( grimy , open rooms , relatively contented-looking inmates sprawled on floor mats ) , Claudia led me down a path lined with hibiscus and into a high-ceilinged room . Otto emerged from a small door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beard going white , and wore flip-flops and a dirty T-shirt . " Please to sit , " he said , indicating a scarred table . Although he had lived in Zaire for nineteen years  --  he owned a vegetable farm in the interior  --  he was from Switzerland and retained a thick German accent . I asked him why he was imprisoned . " I haf some problem wis a general . General is commander of Region Equateur , my province . I haf diamond deal wis his wife , sird wife of general . Diamonds not good quality . She loose a lot of money . General has me arrested . I am here two monts now . " It is a game in zis country , ze justice . No law , nossing . At first , zey demand fifty million nouveau Zaires  --  fife sousand American dollars  --  to set me free . I bargain down to ten million nouveau Zaires  --  one sousand dollars . I bargain more . Now I haf settle everysing at four million nouveau Zaires  --  four hundred dollars . A friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is one sousand miles away . Till zen , I am here . " Otto showed me his cell . It was dark and hot , with a single glass-brick window , a bed , and a table piled with French translations of four Sidney Sheldon novels . I asked Otto if he was locked in at night . " Zey do n't lock us in . We lock ourself in "  --  he pointed to a stick-and-wire latch he had fashioned on the inside of his door " to keep our sings from being stolen . " STAMPEDE As time wore on in Kinshasa , I began to ask myself whether this trip had been a mistake . The boat 's departure date was still vague , and , accustomed to obligingly programmatic American travel , I was finding it difficult to reconcile myself to such huge uncertainties . " Time has no meaning here , " the expat had told me that night at Domino 's . It had seemed a beguiling existential situation at the time , but now I began to wonder if I could endure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend a staple of Zairean life : the free outdoor concert . This one was to be held in Masina . " Masina is the most crowded and miserable neighborood in the city , " Gaston said as Anatole drove the Ford through la cite : " People with no jobs and no money live here . A house rents for about two dollars a month . " Traffic slowed at the crest of a hill . A crowd of maybe thirty thousand people had gathered in an open field , spilling out across the road . Anatole pulled over . We locked the car and followed him into the crowd . He moved swiftly , wriggling between people , searching out the path of least resistance . In less than a minute , the back of his blue shirt was soaked with sweat . That made me realize how hot it was  --  not just hot but humid and rank . The crowd was chanting and swaying , creating tidal surges of humanity that pushed us back and forth . By now , I had been in Kinshasa more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , my clothes , my mouth , my nose . Here in Masina , where the sweat was so stale that it seemed to have achieved fermentation , the smell was almost overpowering . I started to feel asphyxiated . Up ahead , Anatole , with Josh behind him , continued to shove through the crowd . At that moment , a woman in front of me fainted . Her collapse drove me backward . I felt trapped . The faces of the people around me glistened , their expressions a mix of terror and ecstasy . They , too , felt trapped . And when I realized that , I experienced a claustrophobia so intense that it amounted to a type of savagery . Suddenly , I had to get out . Gaston and I tumed and thrashed our way back . We stopped near a broken streetlight , where the crowd as thinner . But just then , a stampede began . Gaston clutched my hand , and we sought protection behind the streetlight . The crowd thundered past on either side . Dust swirled . Women cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyward , drove through in a jeep , pulling behind them a man in handcuffs . The stampeding crowd had poured out onto the highway , completely blocking traffic . The soldiers began firing their weapons in the air , and the crowd came stampeding back . I had been in crowds before  --  at political rallies , demonstrations , rock concerts , sports championships , in angry and exuberant crowds  --  but the one in Masina was unlike any I had experienced . Men and women had turned and were running toward us , their eyes ivory-white , the stampede feeding on itself , since the only way for those in front of the mob to avoid being trampled was to outrun it , to become part of it . No one was capable of individual movement , of resisting the mob 's power and thrust . This , I thought in my panic , is the heart of darkness , not some remote jungle outpost , but this , the deadly tumult of the urban mob . I remained shaken until the concert was over . Josh returned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the crowd for him up to the stage . I started to tell him about the stampede , but then I stopped . It occurred to me that I might have exaggerated it to myself , that perhaps the hysteria had been mine , not the crowd 's , that instead of illuminating Africa , the stampede had merely revealed how difficult it was to see the place clearly , and I said nothing . CHANTAL Early the next week , we learned that the boat would be leaving in two days . The next nigt , I ran into a British satellite technician in the bar of the Inter-Continental . His name was Andrew . He had a sunburned nose , large ears , and the heedless manner of the freelance adventurer . We decided to have dinner at Domino 's . Over couscous and Scotch , he discussed his family ( a wife and two daughters in London ) , his work ( he had been in Mogadishu and Kigali ) , and his abiding passion for acid , cocaine , dope , whisky , and whores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After dinner , we moved to the bar to drink more Scotch . The prostitutes immediately enveloped us . Andrew became entranced by Francine , a young woman whose black satin dress was held together by a gold safety pin at her breasts . Francine said she was nineteen and worked in a photo shop . Soon she was cuddled in Andrew 's lap . " I just love her , man , I just love her , " Andrew told me . " Look at her She 's such a lovely piece . " He nuzzled in her cleavage . " She makes me feel good about myself , man . " I could n't believe he had made such a naked , cliched admission . " I 've just read an article , " Andrew went on . " It said it was more dangerous to have unprotected sex with a nice woman you meet at a Los Angeles cocktail party than to use a condom with an African whore . " " And if you double up on the condoms , you should be home free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heart-shaped face and hair that she had lacquered into ringlets . Her name was Chantal . She refilled our Scotch glasses so many times that at the end of the evening , when Andrew was locked in an extended grope with Francine , I asked her to accompany me back to the hotel . What was I doing ? I immediately thought . I had never taken up with a prostitute in my life , and the idea that I would resort to one at this stage of the game , and on a continent where prostitutes are assumed to be infected with AIDS , was unfathomable . But at the same time , I felt helpless to prevent it . I was , it seemed , surrendering to African nihilism . " She 's got a real spark , that one , " Andrew said . " Go for it , man . Just double up on the condoms . " " I do n't have any . " " I 'll lend you some . " Chantal , who had been off conferring with the manager , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed . Grateful for a way to disengage , I told her we could n't wait , but then she asked for my room number , saying she would be there in half an hour , and I could think of no excuse not to give it to her . The hotel lobby was dark and quiet when I arrived . While the night clerk fumbled for my key , I wondered whether he would allow an unaccompanied barmaid to talk herself upstairs . When I let myself into my room , I saw that my belongings had vanished . A note on the bed said that since the minibar was broken , I had been given a new room . I felt a sudden elation . Now , since Chantal no longer even had my true room number , it seemed almost impossible that she would be allowed into the hotel . I felt at once lucky and , since I have always believed , irrationally , that we deserve the luck we get , uneasy . I had done nothing to earn this reprieve . I slept badly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did show up . THE COLONEL EBAYA I was in a bad frame of mind the day the boat was due to leave . The stampede in Masina and the episode with Chantal had made me question my ability to handle myself . I realized I had no idea what I was getting into . The expat had told me the trip could take thirty-five days . The boat could hit a sandbar or break down . And once it left , there was no turning back . If we got sick or hurt , if we came down with malaria or hepatitis or dengue fever or Ebola , if we were arrested or robbed or kidnapped , we were pretty much on our own . The previous afternoon , Mark Peters , a photographer , and Graham Walsh , a freelance cameraman , had flown in from Johannesburg , where they both lived , so we now made a party of four . Anatole drove us to the dock . We fought our way through the jostling crowd , and there , tied up against a sagging wooden pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight did not raise my spirits . It was squat and ugly , with three decks , a bridge , and a black smokestack . Although it had been painted white , every seam ran red with rust . When I got to the edge of the pier , I saw that a large passenger barge , painted pea-green and rustier than the Colonel Ebaya , was lashed to the boat 's square prow . Another barge , smaller and even rustier , was attached to its port side . Four more barges were tied to the green barge . All seven vessels crawled with people . They were on every deck , on every roof . They were spreading mats , tying tarpaulins , arranging chairs and luggage . Smoke twisted up from portable grills . An immense babble of voices rose over the rumble of the idling engines . It was not a boat we were taking up the river ; it was some sort of incredible waterborne assemblage , a floating shantytown , a nautical village . We clambered aboard . The surfaces were slick with oil and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took us up to the deluxe cabins we had reserved . Josh and I were sharing one room , Mark and Graham the other . The cabins had iron doors padlocked from the outside and steel shutters welded over the windows . The rooms had been closed up for months , and when Membele opened the doors , the air inside was so sour and deoxygenated it was unbreathable . Inside , two narrow beds , with flattened foam-rubber mattresses and covers worn tissue-thin by years of washing , took up most of the space . Muscular , glossy cockroaches scuttled brazenly along the baseboards . The bathroom sink produced a thin trickle of brown water pumped directly from the niver . I experienced a stab of doubt and thought , It 's not too late to pull out . Membele produced a frayed white tablecloth and ceremoniously spread this remnant of colonial grandeur across a rickety card table . As he was doing this , three excruciating blasts sounded on the boat horn . From the barges and the docks came a vigorous cheer . On the roof of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his arms in exultation , and the Colonel Ebaya eased out into the river . SPLIFF Josh and I decided to explore the barges . The decks were so crowded that you could not simply walk them ; they had to be negotiated . Buckets , enamel basins , bales of fabric , stacks of bread , silent crones , and bands of laughing children all clogged the passageways . The tiny cabins on the barges overflowed with belongings , so virtually all of the passengers sat outside on the slender benches and the precarious railings , talking exuberantly in Lingala , playing static-garbled tapes of Zairean music , and smoking African cigarettes with names like Dallas and Mustang . Dress included T-shirts advertising HARVARD ; BLOOMIE 'S ; THE IRS TOOK MY SHIRT ; ELECTED BLACK OFFICIALS OF ILLINOIS ; THE GIPPER SUCKS ; I SUFFER FROM PMS  --  PUTTING UP WITH MEN 'S SHIT ; SHUCK ME , SUCK ME , EAT ME RAW  --  OKEECHOBEE CLAM BAR . By the time we reached the bow of the first barge , the sun had begun to set . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thick , saliva-drenched joint . " Ugandan spliff , " one of them croaked . " Tres bien . Tres fort . " When it came my way , it seemed ungracious to refuse . The smoke burned my throat . It was indeed tres fort . Sharing the dope created an instant camaraderie . We answered questions about the United States  --  How many TV channels are there ? Why do the whites hate the blacks so much ? Do you need a visa to go from New York to Miami ?  --  and watched the sun descend behind the boat , streaking the underbellies of the massed clouds with shades of crimson and tangerine and turning the river that foamed beneath the barge 's prow a deep , impenetrable violet . The beauty was staggering . I told myself , YOu had n't really wanted to pull out . UN CADAVRE When we returned to the main boat , we found a crowd on the deck beneath our cabin . People craned and peered , but in a solemn , ominously restrained manner . " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Un cadavre . " In the middle df the crowd , on a canvas stretcher , lay the body of a handsome , bearded man who looked to be in his thirties . His open eyes were glazed . A man in an aquamarine running suit sat next to the corpse , beseeching it with animated , almost histrionic gestures . " That is his brother , " the woman said . " He is asking him why he died . " I went up to our cabins . Mark , the photographer , was looking down on the scene from the deck . He shook his head and lit a Camel . " A bad omen , " he said . " Hour and a half into the trip and a chap 's down . " Graham joined us . He cadged a Camel from Mark and said he wanted to film the scene . We thought it inadvisable . Mark said he found the very idea distasteful . " I do n't do deaths . I hate fucking deaths . " Just then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him why the man had died . " It was sorcery , " he said . " The man had lots of money and did n't give any to his father , so his father put a curse on him . He should never have come on this trip . " " How do you know sorcery killed him ? " " He was young ; he was healthy . There was hot a mark on him . " The logic of superstition is tempting even ip the most orderly place . In places where the rules you understand do n't apply and you have n't quite grasped the ones that do , it can prove irresistible . Which is why I was not all surprised when , in the middle of the night , the boat broke down . THE FUNERAL First light the next day revealed that we had pulled up against the riverbank . A steady , thin rain rattled the iron roofs of the barges . The air was cool , and smoky wisps of fog trailed through the green hills . A small crowd gathered round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched into a fierce sermon . The women began to sing a Christian hymn that soon evolved African rhythms . They swayed and undulated ; a man beat a tall wooden drum . Mark and Graham came out of their cabin . Despite Mark 's insistence the night before that he did n't " do deaths , " he immediately unpacked his cameras . When Graham hoisted his massive Betamax on his shoulder , some mourners glared in disapproval , and several minutes later a man in the khaki uniform of the boat police appeared . He demanded our permits . Mark and Graham were forced to admit they had none . " Pas de documentation ? C'est un probleme , un probleme serieux . " Did we not know , he asked , that it was insulting to film the funeral ? Did we not realize that we were breaking the laws of Zaire ? We were led down to a cabin in the stern for interrogation . The officer took detailed statements from Mark and Graham , writing both his questions and their answers in a crabbed hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked at Mark and Graham and said abruptly , " Give me $1,000 and you can go . " In the end , they paid him $200 apiece , about what they would have had to pay to get the permits in Kinshasa , and I was glad to see the money go to an impoverished young policeman rather than the reptilian vice-minister . Once the negotiations were over , he dropped his cold interrogatory tone and told us his name was Ame . " Do n't tell the captain what you 've paid me , " he said . At that moment , the boat 's diesel engines shuddered into life . The logic of superstition again seemed to govern events . I decided it was entirely possible that paying the bribe had lifted the curse  --  brought on by the sorcery victim 's death  --  that had grounded the boat . RIVER FIGHT For the next few days , the Colonel Ebraya proceeded upriver at a speed of about six knots . The ruff , ruff , ruff , ruff of the engine was accompanied by an occasional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat-induced expansion of the smokestack 's metal plating . When under full throttle , the entire boat was penetrated by a profound vibration . The water in the water bottle quivered . The notes I took looked as if they had been made by a trembling hand . But the helmsman throttled down frequently as we approached sandbars , pale veins in the brown river . At times , we could feel the sandy bottom grinding against the hull . We befriended several of the passengers and boat officers , including Kasa the cook , who for several years had been the chef on Mobutu 's personal riverboat ( " His favorite food was peanut butter and salad , " he said ) , and Emmanuel Tubman , an unemployed young Liberian who was planning to live permanently on the boat  --  traveling up and down the river in an unending loop  --  because he had a Red Cross refugee card that allowed him unlimited free transportation . He had a pile of ratty hair , wore the same maroon basketball jersey every day , and spoke the slurred pidgin English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liberia coz evibody be wontn a be prezdent . " I got to know the boat 's engineer , Oscar Diuonuka , a young man with a handsome , narrow face and long sideburns . One morning on the bridge , he showed me the chart book . Oversize , its cover missing , it dated back to the colonial era . Each frayed page was not just yellow but brown with age and use . The line on the chart marking the channel had been drawn , erased , and redrawn so often that the paper was gouged . Oscar said that there used to be guideposts along the river by which they could navigate , but most of these had collapsed from disrepair . Now they used landmarks . " See ? " Oscar pointed at the chart , where on the northern bank someone had sketched a tree , along with the words grand arbre . " We head for that . " I looked at the riverbank . Several large baobabs and palms prouuded , in awkward , tufted beauty , above the jungle wall . None @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell which is the grand arbre ? " I asked . " It 's not easy , " Oscar said . " I think it 's that one over there . " He gestured with his shoulder . " We trust to our experience . And to luck . " That night , we passed a substantial village . The river people lived for the most part in small groups of thatched huts nestled in reeds along the banks . It is an extremely isolated existence , and the appearance of our boat provided for them an excitement so delirious it was heartbreaking . As the boat approached the village that night , whistles , shouts , and clapping could be heard coming from the dark shore . House lights blinked on and off . The pilot played the boat 's searchlight along the bank . Hundreds of cheering , teeming people  --  on the dock , at open windows , along the shore  --  were caught in the white are of its illumination , all celebrating our passing with an ecstatic abandon , an uncomplicated , almost miraculous joy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond which the roads to Kinshasa became impassable ; from here on out , the only way into the interior was the river . As a result , we woke the next morning to discover that the boat had been transformed into a bazaar . There must have been two thousand people onboard . ( No one , including the captain , knew the exact figure . ) Of these , it seemed that half were not really travelers but traders making the trip both ways to sell to the people along the river . They had spread cloths , set up tables , and strung lines through the air to display underwear , bras , gold chains , plastic buckets , knives , soupspoons , Tiger Balm , lollipops , piles of nails , bags of sugar and salt , and , my favorite , homemade kerosene lanterns constructed of used tin cans , their wicks protruding through holes punched in bottle caps , which also served as lids . Since the boat stopped only at major towns , the river peole who wanted to trade with the merchants waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached , they paddled toward it and tied on ; there were usually between 100 and 150 pirogues attached like suckfish to the sides of the barges . Docking was a frantic process . When the pirogue drew near , the man  --  or woman or child  --  in its bow would leap into one of the pirogues already attached to the barges , grab the tether ( usually a piece of june vine ) , and brace for the moment of impact . Mishaps were frequent . Late one afternoon , I saw a pirogue suddenly fill with water . Pots of palm oil , gallon jugs of spicy fish sauce , a stack of sugar cane , black-smoked fish , bits of charcoal , and the man to whom they belonged all spilled into the river . The upturned canoe , the floating goods , and the swimming boat owner swept past . And then a fight broke out on another pirogue over whether to rescue the man in the river . Two fishermen began pummeling a third , who untied his dugout and , as it slid by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of them picked up a second paddle and struck back . As they floated away , the setting sun turned them into silhouettes , tiny figures flailing at one another with massive paddles , while farther downriver , the minute head of the man who had fallen in bobbed impassively , his wares scattering across the water . SILVER LANDSCAPE We fell into a routine that made the days pass quickly . We would rise around six and have a breakfast of bread , bananas , mangoes , and bitter coffee made from river water . We would then make the rounds of the boat . We were the only white people onboard , and at our approach children would gleefully shout , " Mundele Mundele " ( Lingala for " white man ' ' ) and then run and hide in their mothers ' skirts . Lunch , the main meal of the day , usually consisted of rice and fried river fish , which was tasty but riddled with countless small bones . We would read through the heat of midday , walk the boat again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do calisthenics up by the bridge while , on the roofs of the barges , groups of soldiers sparred , an evangelical choir regularly sang , and barbers gave young men sculpted haircuts with names like the Prince , the Kingfish , and the Brazzaville Slide . After dinner ( soup , rice , maybe fish again ) , we would drink Scotch and play hearts for a dollar a point beneath a homemade deck lamp ; our steward , Membele , had rigged it out of a cookie box . " Hide it in your room during the day , " he commanded us . " Otherwise , it will be stolen . " The river 's changeable beauty was endlessly fascinating . One afternoon , when we had been on the water about a week , I climbed to the roof of the bridge . We headed beneath a cloud bank and the wind picked up , punishing the river and carrying with it the metallic smell of a storm . The cloud ceiling , which could nor have been more than two hundred feet high , transformed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mist lay atop the nearby marsh grass . Way off to the right , a column of rain enveloped a small island . The river , beneath the low , roiling clouds , had turned the color of pewter . The pirogues waiting for the boat upsaeam were minored in it . One man standing alone in the horiontal sliver ofhis dugout wore a scarlet shirr , and that shirt and its vivid reflection just beneath it were the only dabs of color in the vast , silvery world . THIEVES Every day , it seemed , we were witness to some wild Zairean tableau . One morning , on the main deck , I heard high-pitched screams and angry shouts and saw the flash of khaki . The cook , Kasa , was among the bystanders . " Voleurs , " he told me . Thieves . I pushed through the crowd . Five boys , their arms tied behind their backs , sat against the railing . One of them was the boy in the DUKE SUCKS T-shirt . Five policemen stood over the thieves , shouting questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken our bribe , stood in the middle of the interrogation , directing it . He looked up , caught my eye , and stared coldly . Earlier , when he 'd asked us to keep the bribe a secret , I had decided rather patronizingly that he had a boyish quality . Now he radiated command and brutality . The thieves were drenched in sweat and flecked with blood . A plain-clothes policeman in a CHICACO BULLS T-shirt pulled Duke Sucks forward . Ame asked him where he had hidden what he had stolen . Duke Sucks insisted that the real thieves were some soldiers . " Please , Papa , please " he begged . " No mercy , " Ame told him . The man in the CHICAGO BULLS T-shirt stood on the boy 's legs and began beating the gray , cracked soles of his feet with a thick hose . " Mama Mama Mama Mama " Duke Sucks screamed . " No mercy " Ame said again . " No mercy " SLAUGHTERHOUSE After a week , we reached Mbandaka , a town once known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down through the Ituri rain forest , and that , I 'd been told , is where the jungle really begins . Once we left Mbandaka , the river narrowed , and we often followed a channel near the bank . Not that the bank could be seen . Trees grew out into the water , and blankets of water hyacinths  --  their fat , obscenely green leaves had at first struck me as beautiful but eventually began to seem oppressive  --  choked the bases of their trunks . A web of thick vines created a dense net that appeared to be restraining the jungle . At the same time , game became more exotic . One morning , I found a dead monkey on the deck . It had white whiskers and iridescent green-black fur . A man picked it up by the tail and tried to sell it to me . He probed its white testicles , then squeezed its penis so a small shaft protruded . " A delicacy , " he cackled . " You 'll like it . " That night , I was awakened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness into the white glare of the searchlihts , had boarded . and the merchants were furiously bidding against one another for their game . Within a couple of days , the decks were crawling with huge river carp , otters. wild pigs , boas , web-footed turtles , two-foot-long lizards , dead bats , and trussed baby crocodiles with sticks thrust between their teeth and their long jaws tied shut with vines . The boat soon turned into a sort of ghastly slaughterhouse . Wild pigs were routinely butchered in front of our cabins . Smoked fish , smoked pigs ' legs , and smoked monkeys were piled in stacks on the decks , which were thick with entrails and viscera , blood , mud , palm leaves , and gluey fish scales . An odor of meat and death and rot overtook the boat . At noon one day , a hunter dragged a trussed live antelope onto the deck . Its head lolled back in fatigued defeat . The man pulled out a knife , grasped the antelope by its black antlers , and slashed it across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid the spreading pool of blood . The animal 's sides heaved , but minutes passed and it did n't die . Eventually , the captain  --  a fastidious , reclusive man named Boo  --  came down , prodded it with his toe , and ordered an underling to take it up to his private cold-storage room . He had bought it for $50 , I learned later , and would sell it in Kinshasa for $300 . That afternoon , I went up to the roof and found a man cooking a monkey in the smokestack . He had climbed the rungs on the funnel and was holding the monkey by the tail down inside it . After three minutes , he climbed down and scraped at the monkey 's hair with a fishing knife . He repeated the process  --  climbing the rungs , dipping the monkey into the belching black exhaust , and scraping the fur  --  until the animal was completely hairless , its white skin browned from the smoke . STOWAWAYS As we penetrated farther into the jungle , the river people  --  some now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leopards ' teeth  --  began boarding the boat with an increasing recklessness and aggression . The sides of all the barges were now massed with pirogues ; one day , I counted 120 . The police became more aggressive as well . Beatings , with apprehended thieves or brawlers manacled to the railing , occurred regularly . One morning , as Oscar the engineer and I were standing on the bridge , Ame and his consort in the CHICAGO BULLS T-shirt escorted a group of about twenty river people up the stairs and ordered them to sit on the floor . " Les clandestins , " Oscar said . The stowaways . Ame launched into a harangue that the stowaways listened to without much concern . The men were dressed in rotting fragments of clothing . Their feet were bleached and leprous fom years of standing in the puddles inside their dugouts . The women had their hair in tight cornrows and wore African wrap skirts . One produced a breast and offered it to a toddler who seemed too old to be nursing . " They do n't look worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police will make those who have money pay . They will take the rest to Kisangani , and that is where they want to go anyway . " The police vented their frustration with this state of affairs later that afternoon . I was at the railing when Ame led a detachment through the crowded decks . An officer armed with a machete began hacking at the wrist-thick vines the river people used to tie their pirogues to the barges . Bellowing fishermen leaped into the water after their dugouts . There ; was a pandemonium of splashes . One man tried to step into his pirogue after it had been cut loose . When it slipped out from under him , he lost his balance , toppled backward , and hit his head against another canoe . He submerged and then floated to the surface facedown . The water foamed around him as he drifled astern . Later , I found Ame at a table outside his cabin . He was writing reports in his crabbed , laborious hand . I asked what had happened to the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You do n't stop ? " " He was a fishennan . They do n't pay . Their canoes slow us down . Why would we stop ? " ARRIVAL And then , like that , we reached Kisanani . The trip upriver had taken exactly fifteen days . It ended with neither a bang nor a whimper ; our progress simply ceased . The routine we had followed  --  with its narrow rituals , its intensifying sense of confinement , its disturbing spectacles and the expectation that we accept them without judgment  --  disappeared into the past . It became a tale to tell . A light rain fell hissing onto the river as the boat drew up to the Kisanani pier . It was 6:00 A.M. We tipped Membele the steward and Kasa the cook and passed out the bottled water and tinned food we had not used . Porters carried our bags throuh the rain to the customs shed . Each city in Zaire is a semi-independent fiefdom , with its own immigration shakedown . Mark and Graham , being paperless , were immediately detained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could go after we had checked in with the intelligence police . " Where are they ? " " Just down the road . This man will show you . " The guide had on rubber boots that reached his knees . He led us , with our bags , up a hill and into town . We plodded on and on , past moss-covered offices and rotting bungalows . It rained steadily . Finally , out where the manioc fields began , we came to a ruined house . A functionary in a dripping room studied our documents and pronounced himself satisfied . " But you must see the chief , " he said . " Only he is not here . " " When will he arrive ? " " Since he does not have a car , he will not arrive until the rain stops . It may not be until this evening . " " We will go to the hotel and return later , " Josh said . " No . You must wait for the chief . " Josh took out his cigarettes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I lit up as well ; the uncertainties of the present eclipsed long-term concerns like cancer . We did n't offer a cigarette to the functionary . The smoke drifted out his windows , which had no glass . Rain splattered in the doorway . After an hour , the irrationality of the situation caused Josh to lose his temper . " Why are we being held prisoner ? " he asked angrily . " We have committed no crime . " " You are not prisoners . " " Then why ca n't we go to the hotel ? " " You can . " What was there to say ? The functionary accepted a cigarette . Boots led us back through the rain to a hotel called the Zaire Palace . MONEY CULTURE PLEASURE declared a sign on its wall . My room had no air-conditioning , no screens , no soap . The walls were water stained , the carpet mangy . A porter brought with him a single lightbulb , which he carefully screwed into a metal lamp that had no shade . Early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rain had stopped , and the chief had arrived . " You are free to go , " he said after examining our papers . We asked about Mark and Graham . " The South Afticans are still at the dock . They have problems . " HUMAN FLESH Mark and Graham were freed at the end of the day , having each paid a hundred dollars to the immigration official and a hundred dollars to the intelligence chief . As twilight came on , we set out for a walk , and at a sidewalk cafe called Palm Beach , we came across one of the pilots from the boat . His name was Dieu Donn , " Gift of God . " He was drinking Primus and invited us to join him . We went through several large beers quickly  --  it had been that sort of day  --  and talked with Dieu Donne about the food we had eaten on the trip : boa , crocodile , eel , caterpillar . " I like snake , " Dieu Donn said . He had receding gray hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It makes you strong . " " What about monkey ? " Monkey was the one meat none of us had wanted to try . " Monkey is very good . I like a young monkey . But the best is gorilla . " " Gorilla ? " " Yes . The arms of the gorilla are the best meat there is . It tastes just like human flesh . " Cannibalism in central Zaire had been eradicated only in recent decades ; the doped-up warriors who had seized Kisangani for 110 days in 1964 , dressed in monkey skins and led by a witch doctor , had reputedly been cannibals . I wanted to pursue Dieu Donne 's startling revelation . But he may have had some connection to the warriors , and I was afraid of insulting him . Two girls had been bringing us our beers , and one of us commented on how beautiful the younger of them was . " Do you want her ? " Dieu Donne asked . Without waiting for an answer , he summoned her over , and they spoke for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want her , " Dieu Donne said . The girl sat down with us . She had pale-brown skin , delicate features , and an amiable if slightly vacant expression . She was not a prostitute . And Dieu Donne was not a pimp ; he did not even know the girl . It seemed instead that white men were so fantastically exotic that the idea of a girl in Kisangani declining a sexual invitation from one of them was inconceivble . One of us  --  we made a pact never to reveal who it was  --  took Dieu Donne up on the offer of the girl . It was a long and sleepless night , a night of whining mosquitoes , warm Scotch , dry mouth , and the residual cramps of a minor intestinal virus . The next morning , at a hungover breakfast in the hotel 's musty dining room , the guilty party reported that the girl had been compliant but almost catatonically passive except when , as they were dressing in the dawn light , she had begun to cry at the prospect of being left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnal indulgence , shocked the man into recognition of the girl 's humanity , and that added remorse to his other concerns . He explained that he had grilled the girl about her sexual history ; she was sixteen and had had only one boyfriend , who was now studying in Belgium . " And you believed her ? " " I think she was telling the truth . " " But you of course used a condom ? " " Well , no . " " What ? " " I did n't have one . " Sleeping with the girl , whose acquiescence was so rote that it lacked the quality of free will , was bad enough . But given the AIDS-infection rate , which we had all discussed exhaustively , to do so without a condom was insane . It was nihilism , a complete surrender to irrationality . Though it is tempting to see the episode with the girl as the culmination of the journey , as the inevitable outcome of the brutality , death , blood , heat , and desperation we had encountered  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to blame Zaire , to blame Africa , and that would be neither fair nor truthful . Africa allowed you to forget yourself ; it did n't force you to . But it did make you realize how thin , how porous , is the coherence we all impose on our lives . And it seemed essential to understand that it was imposed  --  an extraneous feature , a way , almost , of dressing . DISCO DANCING Mark and Graham flew out early that morning . Josh and I caught a later flight to Goma , a small town set amid volcanic mountains on the eastern border . We arrived late in the afternoon and the following morning set out for the refugee camps , which seemed to me to represent the most outrageous irony in all of Zaire : The most efficiently run operation in the country , the camps benefited not Zaireans but murderous Hutu who had fled Rwanda after butchering upwards of five hundred thousand Tutsi . But soldiers , predictably , turned us away at the gates , demanding yet more permits . Early the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Goma airport . The sun blazed . The sky was silent and windless . Insects chittered in the dry grass . At ten o'clock , a high-winge Fokker touched down . The pilot , a Kenyan named Mohammed , said he was flying on to the town of Bukavu empty but picking up a full load of Rwandan refugees there for the return to Nairobi . We pleaded with him while he filled his gas tanks . He agreed to take us if we paid him $500 apiece . At Bukavu , Mohammed disappeared into the terminal but returned to say that the airport officials refused to let the passengers leave until they paid a fee . Time passed . The Fokker 's engines ticked in the heat . By midafternoon , the passengers still had not been released . " It 's getting damned late , " Mohammed said . " Now we 'll hit thunderstorms on the way back . " Just then , the passengers streamed out of the terminal . Everyone boarded . The refugees ' luggage  --  steamer trunks , bales , plastic suitcases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Josh and me , we had two more passengers than seats . Mohammed told us to double up . The Rwandan smelling of brass and hay who squeezed in with me quite literally had to put his legs in my lap . When the plane took off , the urgently noisy stall alarm sounded , stopped , then sounded again : beep , beep , beep , beep .... We were overweight ; the plane could n't gain altitude . Mohammed stopped trying to climb , and we skimmed along the tops of trees , volcanoes on both sides of us . After a minute , Mohammed again tried to pull back the stick . Again the alarm went off  --  beep , beep , beep , beep  --  and again he nudged the nose down . Finally , we flew between two mountains , and the land beneath us dropped away . An hour outside Nairobi , Mohammed turned back and called , " Are you ready for disco dancing ? " He made a violent waving motion with his hand . Less than a minute later , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Rain hammered on all the windows . The plane pitched , shuddered , plummeted , and lurched . The engines screamed unevenly . There was no air in the cabin . The stale , brassy odor of the Rwandan next to me intensified . I felt sure that if I did n't throw up , someone else would , and at that point everyone would vomit . I looked back . Every passenger  --  six women , four children , seven men  --  stared at me with enormous white eyes and frozen , agonized grins . The plane flew through the storm for forty minutes . I realized that until then , I had never truly understood what the word endless meant . When we landed , I wanted to hug all the refugees . The best I could manage , once I was on the tarmac , was to reach up through the pilot 's window and gratefully wring Mohammed 's hand . He winked and clucked his tongue . " Fun , eh ? " he said . THE CROSSING The next day , I flew alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) down to a safari camp in the Masai Mara , a national park on the Kenya-Tanzania border . That afternoon , a guide named Steven took me out in a Land Rover . We passed ponderous herds of grazing elephants . Giraffes moved in their slow-motion ballet through the date trees . We came to a small bluff above the Mara River , and Steven was suddenly overcome with excitement . " The wildebeests are crossing , " he said . " This is rare . You are lucky . " An immense herd of wildebeests  --  several hundred , maybe even a thousand  --  was massing on the far bank . The late-afternoon sun gave the river a golden-pink glow . The animals stirred the dust as they pranced back and forth . Suddenly , they began plunging into the water . Because only two narrow gullies up through the bluff , the wildebeests quickly backed up when they reached the near bank . The bottleneck confused them , and their confusion turned to terror . While some of them galloped in single file up the two gullies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their wet , hairy bodies twisting with desperation . Some , in their panic , scrambled onto the backs of others , who were pushed down below the surface of the churning river . The pink dust rose everywhere and with it a deafening groan from the bewildered animals . After twenty minutes , the last wildebeests , snorting and slick , their sides the color of burnished silver , lumbered up the gully , and the herd spread out across the plain to graze . But the river was thick with wildebeests that had been trampled in the crossing . They floated gently on their sides  --  I counted twenty-eight  --  and not all were dead . One weakly lifted its head out of the water and then sank back . Another , submerged except for its hooves , pawed the air with a slow , helpless motion . Downriver , two crocodiles headed upstream , rippling wakes trailing outward as their snouts cut through the water . Two other crocodiles , immense , fat creatures with bellies the size of oil drums , languorously waddled across a sandbar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa , I thought , is that beauty is still inseparable from horror . <p>
