<p> WILSON TRIES END-RUN AROUND WATER LAW <p> Editor  --  Managing California 's water is a challenging task for a democratic government . In 1992 , Congress passed and President Bush signed the Central Valley Project Improvement Act . The act dedicated an additional 800,000 acre-feet of Central Valley Project water to improve depleted fisheries in the Central Valley and the San Francisco Bay-delta estuary . <p> Governor Wilson , at the behest of a number of water agencies , including inexplicably the San Francisco 's Water Department and the East Bay Municipal Utility District , has asked President Clinton to limit the application of this federal law ( Chronicle , August 14 ) . His argument that the federal law violates the 1994 Bay-Delta Accord is simply untrue . The accord was written to accommodate the provisions of the CVPIA , but certainly not to replace it . <p> To those of us who actively support the federal government 's implementation of the CVPIA , it seems clear that Governor Wilson and the water agencies simply do n't like this law . In a democratic society they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not in the public interest for the president , the governor , or any other elected official , to implement only those laws that they like . <p> SPRECK ROSEKRANS <p> Environmental Defense Fund <p> Oakland <p> . <p> CROSS CONTROVERSY <p> Editor  --  As I walked along John F. Kennedy Drive in Golden Gate Park , I came across the Prayer Book Cross . This long standing religious symbol has received almost no attention in the face of the controversy concerning the cross on Mount Davidson . Nonetheless , it is a religious symbol on public property just as the Mount Davidson Cross is . <p> Will the city follow the same solution with respect to the Prayer Book Cross as it has in regard to the Mount Davidson Cross ? Will the city sell a portion of Golden Gate Park to a private interest in order to avoid its responsibility to separate church and state under the Constitution ? <p> Examining the matter in this way illustrates the defect in the city attorney 's proposal to sell off a tiny patch of Mount Davidson in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principled stance and confront the issue . There are times when constitutional principles are more important than easy practicality . Let us remove the Mount Davidson Cross . <p> DAVID M. BIGELEISEN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> HAYES VALLEY GOLD MINE <p> Editor  --  Re the Central Freeway controversy , it has till now been puzzling why our staunchly pro-growth mayor has supported a small district 's fight to remove a vital transportation link against the wishes of 100,000 commuters . But after hearing the mayor say he wants to develop every available square-inch of the city , it all becomes crystal clear . <p> The area now bordering the freeway will become a gold mine for the mayor 's real estate cronies if demolition occurs . While Hayes Valley residents campaign to improve their community , these developers are no doubt quietly waiting in the wings . They must salivate over land so close to the Civic Center , envi sioning luxury condominiums and pricey commercial space to be built as quickly as the mayor can wink . <p> Sadly , the altruistic anti-freeway crowd may end up as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might want to be careful what they wish for . Their reward for hard work toward freeway removal could be skyrocketing rents and evictions for redevelopment . <p> GLEN STEPANOVIC <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> WE CAN HARDLY COMPLAIN <p> Editor  --  Fair play to Mayor Brown for doing his job and sacking landmarks board president Denise La Pointe . Fair play to Joe O'Donohue for razing an 1865 Italianate cottage on his private property on Geary Blvd . If the city ( who used to know how ) wants to preserve its architectural heritage , its overpaid city attorneys should draft legislation to protect significant historical buildings . <p> If we have no laws protecting these gems from demolition , then we can hardly complain when our heritage disappears . <p> SUSANNA I. BOGUE <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> A CAEN MEMORIAL <p> Editor  --  The Herb Caen memorial that Willie Brown would secretly love to see is a towering bronze statue of himself above the inscription , " Herb Caen was a friend of mine , " but the ever- modest Brown will settle for installing Herb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop for pigeons . Can you really imagine anything Herb Caen would detest more ? <p> A while back , Jon Carroll supported a more appropriate memorial that would inset Caen 's own words from memorable columns into the sidewalk along Herb Caen Way . This would allow generations who never enjoyed their morning coffee and Caen to understand why his memory is so cherished . <p> Of course , Willie Brown could n't stand still long enough to appreciate such a memorial , and since he seems determined to go for the bronze , why not choose a site right next to the striding statue of Gandhi behind the Ferry Building ? Herb could be posed holding out a 5-spot , and the ac companying plaque would read , " Here , buddy  --  go get yourself something to eat . " <p> DAVID KELSO <p> Oakland <p> . <p> CONSIDERATION FIRST <p> Editor  --  I 've ridden a bike in San Francisco for more than 15 years . Most drivers have treated me as fragile human cargo atop a muscle-powered device that is subject to instability . Occasionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel insecure by blasting past too closely . But I thank the vast majority of thinking , feeling drivers recognize our differing uses and need for public thoroughfares . <p> It 's consideration , in my view , that makes the difference . And it goes both ways . I get angry at bikers riding two-abreast , chatting unconsciously on narrow roads . I fear for bike messengers who dart in front of delivery trucks downtown . I fear for myself when I exceed my skills and create the potential for an accident . <p> I hope we can all continue to show some consideration . That we can reduce confrontation so that all our viewpoints can be heard . And that we can find better ways of pursuing our lives than through anger and sensationalism . <p> RICHARD DALTON <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> GET OUT OF OUR CARS <p> Editor  --  Hurray for bicyclists ! Last weekend as I was driving home from Marin , I saw an unbelievable sight . Three bicyclists had ditched their bikes and were pushing a Muni bus which had been derailed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to push the bus around the corner , they got back on their bikes . What a telling demonstration of the fact that bicyclists care about people and good , energy efficient transportation for all in S.F. ! <p> I then drove on down to the next intersection where there was a big traffic jam caused by a car accident . As I sat in my car frustrated that I could not get home , I wondered why I was in my car and mused that if I were on my bike instead , I would be home by now . I vowed that in the future I would use my bike more and my car less and hope that San Francisco will listen to the voices and deep concerns of thousands of bicyclists who are calling for safer and good transportation opportunities for bicyclists . <p> Let 's all of us get out of our cars , ride our bikes and fight for safe bicycle and good public transportation for all . <p> DAVID HARTSOUGH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> IN SEARCH OF . . . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply information on the past of two eminent German scientists who fled Hitler Germany in the ' 30s and located in the U.S. They are : a ) Joseph Abraham Long , professor of zoology &; embryology , University of California , 1939-49 .
