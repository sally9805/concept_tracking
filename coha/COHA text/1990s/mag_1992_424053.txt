Nearby Gatlinburg , Tennessee , lures Great Smokies bears into trouble with unsecured garbage . <p> MORE THAN TEN YEARS AGO , Dean Berg received a call from the manager of the Sheraton Hotel in Gatlinburg , complaining that bears were harassing the hotel 's guests . Fairly new at his job as resource management specialist at Great Smoky Mountains National Park , Berg arrived at the hotel and found " the scared patrons in the water , and the bear was circling the pool . " <p> The hotel management allowed bears to eat from the hotel 's dumpsters , and on this particular day , a bear had polished off the garbage and gone looking for poolside snacks , recalled Berg , who worked at the park from 1981 to 1991 . After the bruin was shooed away , the waterlogged guests considered the incident humorous and harmless , but the encounter typifies hundreds of bearhuman interactions in Gatlinburg and elsewhere along park boundaries over the past few years . <p> Gatlinburg , a city of 3,500 permanent residents , is Tennessee 's doorstep to Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motels , hotels , condos , and cabins of this bustling resort accommodate 50,000 visitors a night . Gatlinburg , rather than the national park , is the primary destination for many vacationers , who browse in the craft shops , hunt for bargains at factory outlets , wander through the wax museum , ride the aerial tramway , and explore Dolly Parton 's theme park . <p> In and around town , visitors are bombarded by images of bears  --  Bearland Lodge , Yogi Bear 's Campground , stuffed bears , carved bears , bear statues , teddy bears , Smokey Bear , bear logos on the city trolleys , bear T-shirts , bear trinkets . It 's no wonder the tourists expect to see cute , cuddly , playful bears . <p> Other enterprising entrepreneurs have also targeted this bear mania . Acting on a tip , a reporter recently phoned the Park Vista , a 315-room hotel and convention center that towers over Gatlinburg from a hillside near the park boundary . The reporter inquired , " Will we see bears or deer or other wildlife in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vista 's reservationist replied . " We have one that comes and eats out of our dumpster every day . " <p> " A bear ? " The reporter asked . <p> " Yes , " the hotel employee answered , " a mama and three cubs . " <p> Sevier County wildlife officer Tony Proffitt , a 20-year veteran with the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency , handles one or two bear complaints in the Gatlinburg vicinity each week . " We 've got bears around the hotels , motels , and restaurants , " Proffitt said . " Some of the restaurants put food out for them . It 's a tourist draw to see bears out the windows . " <p> " On numerous occasions , " Proffitt continued , " there have been two and sometimes three bears using the garbage dumpster at the Park Vista . This creates a very dangerous situation . " <p> This year a bumper crop of bears  --  nearly as many animals as the number reported in 1989 when 80 bears were identified as nuisances  --  has raided dumpsters and prowled picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears as well as the potential human injuries . Although black bears have not caused a death at Great Smokies , each year an average of seven incidents involving injuries and an estimated 154 incidents involving damage to property are reported . Damage may be anything from a pawed cooler to a broken car window . <p> Gatlinburg police chief Harry Montgomery says : " People do n't realize that once you feed bears , they will come back . I know folks like to see them , but they need to see them up in the park . " <p> The Appalachian Mountains provide some of the best remaining black bear habitat in the eastern United States . With its half-million forested acres , Great Smoky Mountains National Park shelters 400 to 600 bears . Black bears ( Ursus americanus ) are found from Maine to Montana and from Arkansas to Alaska , but Great Smokies has one of the densest populations anywhere . Many people have seen their first  --  and perhaps only  --  wild bear in Great Smokies . <p> Scientists have scrutinized the natural history and behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor of wildlife science at the University of Tennessee , began studying them in 1968 , and wildlife biologist Kim DeLozier has concentrated on Great Smokies bears since joining the Park Service in 1978 . They have trapped , anesthetized , weighed , tagged , measured , and radio-tracked backcountry bears as well as panhandler bears . <p> Females weigh about 125 pounds and reach an average age of seven , while males often reach twice that size but live half as long . Because of high yearling mortality , the average lifespan seems low for both males and females . Scientists have found that many bears live well beyond the average age and have found and recorded a 24-year-old female and 19-year-old male in the park . <p> Sows den in late autumn and by midwinter have given birth to twins or sometimes triplets . The tiny , nearly naked cubs snuggle against their snoozing mother , suckling milk ten times as rich as a cow 's . By May , when the female brings them from the den , the frolicking cubs weigh four to seven pounds . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bears do not usually eat or drink during the winter months . Resting high in hollow trees or dozing in earthen dens , they burn off up to 30 percent of their fall mass , yet spring vegetation offers little nutrition when bears emerge . Vegetable matter makes up about 90 percent of what the bears ingest early in the year and includes grasses , wildflowers , and unfurling tree leaves . By late May , bears find beetles , wasps , squawroot , and serviceberries , and their weight stabilizes . Bears gorge when blackberries , blueberries , and fire cherries ripen in midsummer , and fall 's acorns provide the abundance needed to restore energy for hibernation . <p> Through the first year , females guard their cubs , but when yearlings are finally driven off , the young bears must find a territory and begin to fend for themselves . According to biologist DeLozier , the Great Smoky Mountains bear population produces about 100 more animals each year than habitat within the park can accommodate . <p> Bears are most active at night , but yearlings defy normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they often wander outside the park , " DeLozier says . Yearlings suffer high mortality , but once they get past the second or third year , bears have a good chance of surviving . <p> When acorn crops are poor , bears scout more widely in search of food . These hungry animals may range over 100 square miles or walk a dozen straight-line miles a day . Once they leave the sanctuary of the park , the animals are more likely to get into trouble . <p> " Gatlinburg keeps growing , " said Tony Proffitt . " As the city limits expand , there is increased traffic and associated animal mortality . Everyone wants to be next to the park , " he added . " They want wildlife . They leave their bird feeders up in the summer or leave food out for the dog . They do n't mean to attract a bear , but it comes . You also have those who feed bears for enjoyment . " Bears eventually become so conditioned , they roam in the daytime , tearing up door frames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they smell food . <p> " The people are then terrified , and I have to move the bear , " he said . " I have three options . On occasion I use plastic shotgun pellets to repel the bears . The next step is to trap and move the animals . " Park researchers have discovered that nuisance bears must be relocated at least 40 miles from their territories to keep them from returning for free food . Great Smoky Mountains National Park is so close to Gatlinburg that bears moved to the park head right back into town . <p> " For years we 've moved them to ' Bear Heaven ' in Cherokee National Forest , " Proffitt said , " but this distresses me because they are probably less protected there , and we do n't know what happens to them . As a last resort , I can issue a permit to kill a nuisance bear . I hate to do that . " ( See page 22 for information about a proposed landfill near the park where NPS has historically relocated garbage-seeking bears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed . Before that , however , bears were shot more often . In 1966 , for instance , 15 bears were killed . <p> " Once bears become day-active , " said DeLozier , " it 's a matter of time before the animal has to be relocated or put to sleep . Directly or indirectly , feeding bears kills bears . " <p> DeLozier , Pelton , and other researchers have determined that panhandling bears live only half as long as wild bears . Either the animals are harmed by ingesting plastic wrap , broken glass , metal shards , and toxic substances in garbage , or they become easy targets for poachers . <p> Each year poachers kill an estimated 45 to 80 bears in and around the park . A U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service sting operation , which ended in 1988 , netted more than 60 people who were arrested for killing bears and selling their parts for profit . Those arrested through " Operation Smoky " were believed to have killed as many as 500 bears for their claws , feet , teeth , heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dried bear gallbladder for Asian potions brings $35 to $75 an ounce . Although not an endangered species , black bears are listed under the Convention on International Trade of Endangered Species ( CITES ) because of poaching problems . The Convention prohibits the sale or export of listed species . <p> " A big problem , " DeLozier said , " is a misconception of what feeding wildlife is . Leaving a bucket of fried chicken on the table to draw a bear in or not securing garbage ... is actually more damaging than handing a cookie to a bear . " <p> " If a bear can walk up and take a cookie out of your hand that bear has progressed so far behaviorally to a habitual condition that the bear is hopeless , " DeLozier said . " It can not be reversed to a wild state . Unsecured nighttime garbage is damaging because that may be the early stage in behavioral change of bears being habituated to people . " <p> DeLozier speaks from experience . By his own admission , the park 's Chimneys picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1990 " the worst spot in the eastern U.S. for habituating wild bears to people . " <p> Visitors routinely left food out at Chimneys , attracting bears with chicken bones and watermelon rinds scattered in the bushes . The bears came day after day , year after year , teaching their offspring how to frighten picnickers away from coolers or slap open trash cans . <p> Two summers ago , DeLozier and his staff declared war on the free food at Chimneys . " We knew the garbage disposal system was not adequate , " DeLozier recalled , " so we used bear-proof garbage cans and evaluated various dumpsters . " Before the picnic area closed at dusk , the " clean team " removed concealed melon rinds , collected cookie crumbs from under the tables , and scrubbed meat scraps and melted marshmallows off the grills . <p> " It 's impossible to keep bears out of the picnic area at night because of the lingering smell , " DeLozier said of the animals , whose noses can easily detect odors a mile away . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuisance bears at the picnic area . In 1991 night observations revealed bears roaming through Chimneys , but without positive food reinforcement , they did not linger . " We did not remove a single bear from Chimneys last year , " DeLozier said proudly . " When you do n't have to take bears out , it promotes natural regulation and dominance within the population . " <p> Two bears did begin to ignore the researchers ' spotlights . " Wild bears , when they see a human or are hit by a spotlight , should run . These two would stop and look at you , not affected by the light , " said DeLozier . To instill a healthy dose of fear into the animals , the researchers caught the bears and attached ear tags , gave each a lip tattoo , took blood samples , and pulled a tooth to determine ages . ( Researchers can tell how old a bear is by counting the number of rings on its tooth . ) " Then we released them in the middle of the busy picnic area the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them since . " DeLozier believes the negative stress of capturing the bears , combined with the fact that they found no food at Chimneys , was discomforting enough for them to abandon the site . <p> Wild bears are not as visible as panhandlers , and long-time Smokies visitors are noticing the difference . " People are not necessarily happy about this , " DeLozier confirmed . In a conversation overheard at a Gatlinburg civic club , a local man complained that the purge at Chimneys was " not only hurting business at Gatlinburg but affecting the whole economy of Sevier County . " <p> The statement may be an exaggeration , but it does explain the rationale behind establishments such as Park Vista allowing bears to feed at dumpsters . According to Smokies Chief Ranger Jason Houck , the National Park Service has regulations against feeding wildlife , " but it is not against the law to feed a bear within the city limits of Gatlinburg . " He continued , " What 's particularly annoying and unsettling is to have the hotel publicly do something so contradictory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park . " <p> Pelton added , " Feeding is a pretty appalling thing . It flies in the face of everything we 've been trying to do to cut down on the problems with bear interactions . " Although Gatlinburg may have the most obvious problem , none of the towns abutting the park has ordinances prohibiting the feeding of bears . <p> " I 've talked with the city of Gatlinburg about some kind of ordinance , " Proffitt said . " I believe metal lids on the dumpsters would be effective , but we have not gotten very far with it . " <p> DeLozier was contacted two years ago by an official from the Park Vista . " I told the guy , ' Nighttime garbage is the problem , ' " he said . " When bears are afraid of people , they wo n't confront them during the day , but they will steal garbage at night . It 's the most critical time to do something . They were told two years ago to cover their dumpsters with a metal lid . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tub . I told them that needs to be encased or left inside . The times I 've been up there since , that 's still outside , and there are bear teeth marks in the lid . " <p> The hotel management seems to know what to do . When asked recently about the problem , Park Vista spokeswoman Dottie Adams said , " They 're old dumpsters , and we 're trying to get the lids to go on them . Our engineering department is in the process of checking into having them made . " Adams did not know when  --  or if  --  the dumpsters would be covered . <p> " The Park Vista is not the only problem in Gatlinburg , " DeLozier said , " it 's just the most visible . " Feeding bears is widespread in town , although much of it is unintentional and results from untidy garbage bins . DeLozier knows of places in town where unnaturally bold bears have killed pets , and wildlife officer Tony Proffitt says he has been dreading a more serious incident . <p> Dr. Pelton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years ago at which park officials presented bear management suggestions to Gatlinburg city managers . Pelton said recommendations included " a more aggressive garbage pickup system and education " of hotel-motel owners and area residents . The city is apparently open to suggestions but has not made the next step toward fixing the problem . <p> DeLozier favors a city ordinance making it illegal to feed bears . " If you try to do what is best for the bear , it 's not necessarily what all the people want , " DeLozier said . " My objective is to manage a wild bear population . We 're not in the business of providing nuisance bear-viewing opportunities . " <p> Convincing area residents and business owners not to lure bears into backyards will be difficult . According to Tony Proffitt , enforcing a no-feeding ordinance will require extra patrols , but he urges the city , county , and Park Service to take coordinated action soon for the benefit of the bears . <p> Several years ago , Great Smokies naturalist Arthur Stupka wrote , " As long as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risks and problems that go hand-in-hand with these animals .
