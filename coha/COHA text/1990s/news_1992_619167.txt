<p> PETER CHELSOM likes to recall the flash of misgiving that struck him one day in India when he had the starring role in a " dreadful " movie . " Oh , God , " he thought , " I do n't want to be a bitter actor at age 40 thinking I could do it better than the director . There 's nothing worse . " <p> That wo n't be Chelsom 's fate . At 35 , he 's basking in the acclaim for " Hear My Song , " his first feature as a director . It 's a pixilated comedy about a popular Irish tenor who went on the lam from British bloodhounds sniffing out tax evaders while a dubious double three decades later steps into the singer 's limelight . Starring Ned Beatty as the legendary Josef Locke , the film opens Friday at the Bridge Theater . <p> The double is booked into Heartly 's , a favorite club for Liverpool Irish , by impresario Micky O'Neill , as " Mr. X  --  Is It or Is n't It ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their favorite tenor , and the double even momentarily fools the old beauty queen Locke once seduced . When she blows the whistle on Mr. X , it 's double trouble for O'Neill , who has just become engaged to her daughter . <p> Remorsefully , O'Neill heads for Ireland to track down the singer who has been missing for 30 years , a frenetic journey that takes him and his pal , Fintan , from Dublin to the scenic land and seascapes of Counties Wicklow , Clare and Galway . <p> Growing up in Blackpool , the son of an antiques dealer , Chelsom knew that Locke had owned a local theater , was called " Mr. Blackpool , " and sang there for 19 seasons , but he did n't give the matter any further thought . Then one day , while driving to Blackpool where he was making his short film , " Treacle , " he played a Locke tape on the car stereo . <p> " I was struck by the fact that it was seductive and outrageous , the stuff of old values but anarchic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent films . " The movie is true to the song style of the real Josef Locke . It rides a sharp edge of becoming ludicrous , operatic , mock heroic , and has a bite that diffuses the sentiment . " <p> When he looked into Locke 's life , there were so many contradictory reports that he figured there must be more than one Locke . " The real Mr. X so categorically denied he was Locke that everyone assumed he was Jo on the run . In real life , Jo was wanted for 10 years and was n't allowed in mainland Britain or he would have been arrested . Actually , he resolved his tax problems by 1968 . " <p> Chelsom found Norman Teale , Locke 's old agent , now 78 . When Locke disappeared , Teale went on to represent Mr. X. " Agents , you know , do they give a damn ? " Chelsom asked rhetorically with an amused shrug . Teale told Chelsom that Mr. X 's masquerade worked . He was at the back of the hall for one Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't fool me . I know it 's Jo Locke because I slept with him . " <p> Her remark was the inspiration for the fictional character of Kathleen , the beauty queen Locke seduced and abandoned . A line in the film goes : " You cast your mind back 30 years and see and hear what you want to see and hear . " It 's particularly true , Chelsom observed , of a " provincial beauty whose finest hour was an affair with a popular singer and how rose-tinted that memory can be . " <p> People say the film is like a story told over a pint of Guinness . " I had to laugh when I heard that , " Chelsom said , " because I told Jo my story over six pints of Guinness one long afternoon . He said , ' You have a wild imagination . ' I liked him . He was everything I hoped he would be . It 's like when Judy Garland sings , and you hear the first bar of ' The Man That Got Away , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life . When you hear the real Jo Locke sing you know that there 's some kind of life behind that voice , but he never thought the film would happen . " <p> Meanwhile , Adrian Dunbar , who had meet Chelsom when they were both acting in the Royal Court theater , joined him as a co- writer and agreed to act the part of O'Neill . Then Locke disappeared to Spain without having signed his clearance of rights . In a case of art 's imitating life , O'Neill says in the film , " We 're going to Spain . " Like Fintan , Adrian said , " No way . " <p> Cut to Chelsom and Dunbar driving through Spain . " We found Jo in a Malaga bar , and when he saw us he was a bit shocked . I think he was calling our bluff , but I think he realized then that we meant business . I had half his fee with me , " Chelsom recalled . " We felt like a couple of hit men actually . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bargain showed him " Treacle , " his quirky , 11-minute film about six show-business characters in Blackpool . However , he had to keep urging Beatty to give a " huge " performance . Finally , after Beatty heard the larger-than-life Locke sing at a private dinner for the cast and at a public concert in Dublin , Beatty was convinced that he was a singer who had the capacity to make every individual think he was singing for him or her . The voice in the film is that of Vernon Midgley , an English tenor who was the only person who could re-create Locke 's voice . The original Locke recordings were not in any condition to be used on a sound track . <p> When " Hear My Song " was shown in Locke 's hometown of Derry in Northern Ireland , his fans loved it . The only problem Chelsom had was in trying to forecast the unpredictable Irish weather . Every other aspect was planned meticulously . " If you 're going to make a film for $ 2 million pounds $ 3.5 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . The film was financed by Limelight , Channel 4 and British Screen , a government-funded body to further British film making and encourage new directors . <p> Chelsom credits his ability to work efficiently to his experience making commercials . He began making his comic commercials after he got fed up with acting in " boringly respectable " companies such as the Royal Shakespeare and in television . American audiences may recognize him as the son in Masterpiece Theater 's " Sorrel and Son . " <p> ONE great influence was Gavin Miller , who directed Chelsom in Dennis Potter 's drama " Cream in My Coffee " and also directed the marvelous film , " Dream Child . " " Gavin is a makes films with a great deal of affection for those on either side of the camera . I admire Louis Malle because ' Au revoir , les Enfants ' is a model of seamless storytelling . I ca n't remember a single camera angle or shot or cinematic trick and that 's how film making should be . " <p> " Hear My Song " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Chelsom designed it that way , to intentionally break the rules . " When Josef says , ' We sail at first light , ' the next scene should be the boat but we throw in the scene with the cow in the well . We are consciously breaking the rules . " <p> Chelsom is a little surprised to find himself admiring another rule breaker : Oliver Stone . " I have not been a fan of his until I saw ' JFK . ' It 's staggering . It 's a film that 's full of cinematic wizardry but used in the right way this time . If he has ever raised an issue , at least it 's provoked the right thought . It 's a film that has endured in my mind and I hope that for Americans it endures in their feelings and passions about what may be wrong with the establishment . It 's also a film that I 'll refer to whenever I think I 'm bullying a technician or sound man or editor or cinematographer who says something can not be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have this conversation anymore . Go and see " JFK " and then tell me what you can not do ' because that film really does set new bounds in cinematic language . " <p> AS for Chelsom and Dunbar , they 're finishing work on a script called " Sam and the Captain . " It 's a philosophical comedy about an over-the-hill American director of TV commercials . " It will become an American film because it 's an observation on America . It 's not me becoming a Hollywood director . It 's me directing in Hollywood . It 's a huge , large-scale production . We may regret it in two years ' time . "
