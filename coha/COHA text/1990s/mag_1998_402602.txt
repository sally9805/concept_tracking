SETTING UP YOUR BAR Do n't feel that you have to compete with the local bar when it comes to offering choices . For basics , include a red wine , a white wine , vodka and rum . Gin , cognac ( or other brandy ) and liqueurs ( such as Kahlua and Baileys ) form the second tier ; also consider tequila , bourbon , scotch and , of course , the favorite spirit of a select guest . The caterer 's rule of thumb : One drink per person per hour ( it balances out ) . For 20 people , count on the following amounts : 5 ( 750-ml ) bottles white wine 3 ( 750-ml ) bottles red wine 2 fifths vodka 1 fifth rum 1 fifth gin 12 bottles beer 4 bottles of Champagne ( for toasting only ) 5 quarts sparkling water 2 quarts diet cola 2 quarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 quart grapefruit juice 0 <p>
