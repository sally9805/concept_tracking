<p> Like other single parents , Spencer Dillman of Boca Raton , Fla. , faces an annual decision : what kind of summer vacation to plan with his 13-year-old daughter , Ashley . Over the years the two have camped in the Smokies , toured Washington , cruised in the Caribbean , and hiked in Vail , Colo . In the process , he has discovered that although traveling solo with a child can bring great rewards , choosing the right vacation can also be an art . <p> " Divorced dads I know are all wondering what to do with our kids , " says Mr. Dillman , a senior account representative for Southern Bell . " Some of my buddies send their kids to camp for two months . Then they 'll do a vacation by themselves . But I want to spend time with my daughter . " <p> Yet Dillman found the camping trip with his daughter " arduous " because he was responsible for supplying all the food , shelter , and entertainment . In Washington , he discovered that Ashley , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciate the Smithsonian and the Museum of Air and Space . And although the cruise last year " was OK , " Ashley enjoyed it less than he had expected . " She did n't really want to mix with a lot of other kids , " he says . <p> As the number of single parents increases , decisions like these are becoming common . Parents must balance their own vacation wishes with those of their children . Many must also manage a tight budget . <p> Plan time carefully <p> Some tour operators and cruise lines are capitalizing on this market by devising packages for single-parent families . Most airlines and hotel chains offer reduced rates for children . Beginning this spring , Club Med is including a " Single Parenthood " option as part of its " Family Escape " program . Parents and children can stay in the club 's " family villages " in Mexico , the Caribbean , and the Bahamas . Children might stay two weeks while their parents visit on alternate weeks . ( Cost for one adult and one child : $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , $ 2,399 . ) <p> Whatever a parent 's budget , Susan Krieger of Boston , a licensed family counselor specializing in single-parent issues , urges parents to plan their time carefully . " A short wonderful vacation is worth a lot more to everyone than a longer vacation that gradually deteriorates , " she says . Ms. Krieger also emphasizes the importance of maintaining realistic expectations . " Focus attention on the chance to spend relaxed time with the kids doing things they enjoy , and not on seeing sights on a whirlwind tour . " <p> Patty Marquis , a single mother in Belmont , Mass. , learned the wisdom of that advice the hard way when she took her son , Peter , to Washington when he was 7 . With fond memories of her own childhood visit to the nation 's capital , she wanted to give him a similar experience . <p> But Peter 's heart was on sports , not sightseeing . To compound the challenge , tourist attractions were crowded with spring-break visitors , lines were long , and their motel was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I hated it , " says Peter , now 10 . " There was a lot of walking , and that was n't fun . The only thing I really cared about was all the little souvenir stands on the street . " <p> Adds Ms. Marquis , a social worker , " Pete was interested in basketball . That was his passion . We really should have gone to the Bulls game . You have to look at what your child loves , not what you enjoyed as a child . " <p> For now , she and Peter prefer to spend vacations at an inn on Cape Cod . " We used to go there as a family , " says Marquis . " Now he goes for a week with his father and a week with me . Structure and ritual and routine help to hold a family together in a time of change . " <p> Developing traditions <p> That kind of continuity also appeals to Dillman . In July , he and his daughter will return to Vail on a package vacation for single-parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Up to 12 families take part in each week-long guided trip , which includes mountain biking , hiking , whitewater rafting , and a cattle drive . " We 're bikers , and Ashley likes to horseback ride , " Dillman explains . <p> Ken Richter , the divorced father of three daughters who created the tour , says , " As a single parent , you sometimes lose traditions . This became a new way to establish a relationship with a child , and it worked . These kids grow up when they 're in the outdoors . It 's impressive to see what they 'll do . " Costs range from $ 1,395 for an adult to $ 595 for the first child and $ 350 for each additional child . <p> For most single parents , trips like these are unaffordable . Chris Vose , a barber in Orlando , Fla. , was a single parent for several years when her two daughters were in elementary school . To keep costs down , she bought a small tent and took the girls camping at a large park in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods , " says Ms. Vose . " Very basic things excited them . They did n't get bored , even though there was no TV and no radio - just listening to the creek . They really got peaceful , and they ate better . Everybody had their little work jobs around the campsite . It worked out well . Now every vacation they choose is in the woods . " <p> For budget-minded parents who prefer something less rustic , Tanya Fischer , editor of a newsletter called Single Parenting Economics , suggests going away just for a weekend . Ms. Fischer , who lives in Orlando with her two daughters , ages 3 and 7 , also notes that options exist beyond expensive theme parks . " I 've lived in Orlando my whole life and my kids have never been to Disney , " she says . The YMCA sometimes offers single-parent discounts , she adds , making a Y membership for the summer one way to " vacation " at home . <p> Low-cost options <p> The greatest economy comes with what Fischer calls " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and videos on another country and reading about its culture . Using ethnic cookbooks , a parent and children can cook a meal typical of that country . Or the family can order ethnic food - Chinese , Thai , Japanese , Mexican - from a restaurant . <p> Maralyn Facey of Toluca Lake , Calif. , the mother of a six-year-old daughter , Claire , further expands the definition of vacation . " I consider every time you put your child in the car to go on an adventure - it 's travel , " she says . <p> Ms. Facey and Claire take advantage of free jazz concerts at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Friday evenings . " Being a single parent does not mean your life is just limited to the park , " she says . " There are so many activities open to your children , from the junior philharmonic to art galleries , even to rock concerts , if you can handle them any more . You <p> can also take your children to Chinatown - they love that . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sophisticated , civilized , and cultured people , how are they going to get these things unless you take them various places ? " <p> Last spring , Facey , editor-in-chief of a newsletter called Solo : A Guide for the Single Parent , took Claire to New York during spring vacation . A travel agent found an inexpensive package , and the two spent five days wandering through the city , marveling at everything from gargoyles on churches to the multitude of languages around them . Explaining that tulips and daffodils were blooming along busy Park Avenue , Facey says , " There I was , from my parent point of view thinking , ' Oh , look at all this traffic . ' There she was , at her level , saying , ' Mom , look at these flowers ! ' " <p> Some parents find satisfaction in sharing vacations with other single-parent families . One summer Candelaria Silva , a parenting-education specialist at Families First in Cambridge , Mass. , and the mother of two children , rented a beach cottage in Rhode Island with two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven children , they took along a college student , splitting the cost of her room . Before leaving home , the three women held a meeting to establish rules and responsibilities . <p> " Since then I 've become a believer in bringing extra hands , " Ms. Silva says . " Sometimes on vacation I just want to veg out , and having someone who can take the kids on a day trip or who does n't mind watching a million goofy movies has been very helpful . " <p> Another time Silva and a friend who has two children spent a week in Provincetown , Mass . " She cooked three nights , I cooked three nights , " Silva says . " We liked to do different things . I did n't mind staying on the beach all day with the children , and she preferred taking them to museums . We complemented each other that way . " <p> Beyond the usual benefits of vacations , leisure activities give children a chance to see a parent in a different light .

If it 's an onerous , heavy responsibility all the time , where are they going to go for their fun ? I want them to know that Mom is also fun - not just the ogre who says , ' Clean your room , do your homework , and eat your vegetables . ' You need a sense of humor and adventure if you 're going to be a parent . "
