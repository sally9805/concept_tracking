Lo ! I shall tell you a mystery .  --  I Corinthians 15 : 51 <P> The sun is shining in an azure sky , mockingbirds are chirping in the snow-white blossoms of the pear trees , and the bees are buzzing from one glorious daffodil to another . It is early March , the middle of Lent , and Catholics all over the world are immersed in contemplation and penance over the passion and suffering of Christ . But just outside the chapel where David Burton is teaching a class for new Catholic initiates , on the green grounds of the Cathedral of the Incarnation in Nashville , Tennessee , the season seems intent on fast-forwarding beyond late winter and penance right into renewal  --  to Easter , perhaps . Or perhaps to something even more glorious . <P> Burton likes to think about heaven . He might even be said to revel in it . Oddly enough , he has had to struggle to think about it or at least to find fellow believers and pastors whom his thoughts do n't embarrass . And more oddly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 14 years ago , when Burton , then attending the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis , Maryland , converted from his childhood Southern Baptist faith to Catholicism . For the most part , the switch suited him fine . The Baptists were a little too easygoing for him ; he preferred the Catholic view that salvation depends not only on accepting Jesus but also on what you do with your life . There was one hitch . As the months following his conversion turned to years , it dawned on him that the same Catholic chaplains who had welcomed him into the fold were reticent about discussing salvation 's reward . This was disturbing . " I felt a real lack in my life , " says Burton , who now teaches mathematics at Vanderbilt University . " There was this hope of heaven I thought we all should have . But the priests did n't like to talk about it . We have the Commandments from the Lord : feed the hungry , and clothe the naked . Most of us do n't just have the knack for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone would say , ' Let 's do this so we can go to heaven , ' someone else would say , ' No , no , no , no . Let 's do it because we should do good . ' It got to the point where I began to think that heaven was too much like an ace in the hole , that it was sort of like cheating . I almost felt guilty thinking too much of heaven . " <P> Now there 's a peculiar idea . Is it possible for a Christian to think of heaven too much ? How can one enjoy robust faith without envisaging faith 's ultimate consummation ? " Heaven is the greatest good , " says Peter Kreeft , a professor of philosophy at Boston College and author of the 1990 volume Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Heaven ... but Never Dreamed of Asking . " It is the reason that God banged out the Big Bang 18 billion years ago . Next to the idea of God , the idea of heaven is the greatest idea that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . "
