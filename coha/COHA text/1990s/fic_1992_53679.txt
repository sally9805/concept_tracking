Lewis Houser and his thirteen-year-old son , Nathan , were hiding behind a toolshed in the tragic state of Missouri . They had been like that for over an hour  --  waiting  --  ready to salvage their lives and take what was theirs . " Ground rule number one , " Lewis had told Nathan earlier , " is no talking , not even a single word , because the hot , windless air can take a sound and stretch it and make it burn as long as a wooden match . " Nathan was small for his age , but he understood perfectly what they were doing , and as he stood there with his father behind the toolshed , he was determined that the sun could bake him and that he could stand forever and a day on a boy 's shaky legs , but he would not say a word . <p> From their secret vantage point , Lewis and Nathan watched the back of the house , specifically the screen door , which had banged open and shut twice since they began their wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , first to empty a white sack into a garbage can and then to hang laundry on the clothesline . Lewis noticed that she was thinner than before , tanned and rather blow , no longer the Snow Queen , no longer the rouged Queen Bee he had married in a rough but pretty ceremony in Ely , Nevada . <p> " She 's no one that we even know anymore " - that was ground rule number two , and three weeks ago Lewis had bought Nathan a lime snow cone to explain it . " She was your mother once , " he told Nathan in a snack shop called Pacific Ice , " but now she 's another woman . She made her choices , and they did n't include us . Thirteen is old enough to swallow your teeth and accept that . " <p> And , in fact , Nathan had felt nothing when Alta came out of the house . In the past three years that she had been living another life , Nathan had practiced feeling nothing , had steadily pressed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of school until his father had seen it , opened the bottle of Merthiolate , and said , " Boys who like to hurt themselves do n't even wind up with parole . " <p> When Nathan looked at Alta there in her yard after so much practice , she was just someone reaching up to hang a wet shirt on a line . She was only a tired-looking , dark-haired obstacle who separated them from what they had driven eight hundred miles in an oil-guzzling Chrysler to retrieve . <p> They knew Todd was inside the house , and they knew that they were in limbo until they had him back  --  the three of them in the Chrysler heading into a star-stopped , million-dollar world where Lewis said their bread would always come buttered hot . The windows in the house were open , and soon after they arrived at their point of surveillance , Lewis and Nathan heard the TV from inside , something that sounded like cartoons  --  a duck talking , a woodpecker going crazy on a tree . Lewis had turned to Nathan and pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes in response , signaling that he 'd heard it , too . <p> Standing silent as grass , their cotton shirts sweated through , they waited in their place and became familiar with ground rule number three  --  invisibility At first Nathan could not imagine being a ghost , but that 's how his father had described it . " No one can see us . Everything has to be done in the blink of a blue eye . " They had bulldozed the brown getaway Chrysler into a hearty stand of sumac just down the road so that the car became invisible as well , vinyl top and rust spots lost in the dense Midwestern cover . Now they stood at the very edge of the toolshed in a hairline margin of safety where they could watch the house , but still remain unseen . " One careless move , a sneeze or even a cough , could ruin everything , " Lewis had warned Nathan , but Nathan had sworn he could do it , he could be a ghost , he could swallow a sneeze , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Know what a felony is ? " Lewis had asked Nathan while changing the plugs on the Chrysler weeks ago . Nathan thought his father had said melody , so he answered yes . Lewis nodded and bent back over the engine , which was a place of comfort for him  --  gaskets and pinpoint metal and the high-frequency belts humming when all was right . <p> There was no such comfort in Alta 's yard , behind the toolshed , where the two of them shifted their weight from leg to leg . Lewis had shown Nathan how to stand loose , how to relax and let his arms hang like riffraff , but at the least sound or signal , they were to cock their heels and get eagle-eyed , quick . " Do n't keep time or it 'll wind up keeping you , " Lewis had warned Nathan . An hour  --  which they had not tracked  --  in the midday sun had turned even their hair hot , and when Nathan moved his hand to the top of his head to shield it for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard no . <p> Shortly after that , the back door opened with a dull scraping for the third time , and Todd walked down the limestone steps . Neither Lewis nor Nathan had seen him in three years , but both of them knew the towheaded four-year-old in an instant . They had lived their lives for him , driven across three states , and spent hours rehearsing a plan that was skintight and urgent . They had let go of everything back then  --  Alta and the house in Durango and the easy constellation that the four of them had once made  --  except Todd , the baby , whom they could not forget . He had been too tiny then , just honeycomb wrapped in a blanket , but now he was halfway to Lewis 's waist and had more than a fighting chance . <p> It went like this : Todd lingered on the steps , looking down at his bare feet , and for both Lewis and Nathan , that was the most difficult moment , the future flickering but not quite there . Nathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead man , the ball in the socket of this operation  --  who crouched now , concentrating , calculating the distance and multiplying it by their adrenaline . <p> Then slowly , like someone in a wavy dream , Todd took three steps toward the yard  --  there was a tricycle in the grass and the bright plastic pieces of some former toy . Lewis lifted his hand , made a fist , and he and Nathan went running , skimming the ground , really , moving in what Lewis had described to Nathan as a " moment 's opportunity  --  sometimes a crack no wider than a jarred window through which the rest of your life might be waiting . " <p> Nathan was at Lewis 's side , not a follower now , but a thinking , running , feeling shadow who saw the expanse of grass between him and his brother , Todd , as a long , green tunnel , the sky above as a blue corral . And it was then , suddenly , that Nathan thought of himself as a horse  --  long-legged and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or you 'll monkey-wrench yourself , " his father had told him , and now , moving closer and closer to their target , Nathan doubted that he even had feet , except for the presence of his shoes . They were girls ' high-top Keds , and it was the only thing in all the world he resented his father for . <p> If Alta had looked out the kitchen window then , she might have seen something shimmering , something in a mad hundred-yard dash , white heat waves , or just a man and a boy , but Alta was making beds , struggling with a sheet to make a tight , hospital fit . <p> Outside , Lewis picked the boy up , the towhead , the astonished baby whose face , Lewis could see now , was still sweet and small as an egg . Todd weighed forty pounds , Lewis guessed , as much as a wet shepherd pup , and Lewis pulled him tight to his chest , in love  --  yes  --  but also in strategy  --  no kicking , no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , not a thing he Liked to do , but the windows were open , and Alta had three ears and eyes in the back of her head and one time claimed ESP during her period . <p> In all of it  --  the plan to get their lives back  --  Lewis and Nathan never stopped running  --  across the yard , then down for the boy , up and over the back hillside , and finally toward the car . " Fly , " Lewis had told Nathan , and he said it just the way Nathan thought the word should be said : spellbound , drawing the sound out into thin air . " Leave a footprint , " Lewis had warned in the early stages , " and that 's as good as a letter of introduction . Make a leaf fall , and our butts are instantly stewed . " <p> So they were ghosts and birds , not the two of them , but three now , plowing through the Missouri countryside , which was not a landscape made for speed , covered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush . Lewis and Nathan were breathing hard , looking ahead for the car , though Lewis knew , every minute , every second , just where they were . For an instant , he looked down at Todd in his arms , and the thing about being a father which he had felt before at unexpected times  --  like electricity , like biting on a hot , bare wire  --  ran through him . <p> Minutes later , days later  --  Nathan thought of it as years  --  they arrived at the car , which Lewis had said only a weisenheimer would see as safety . They hurriedly got in and anchored Todd between them in the front seat , and with his mouth finally uncovered , he started his eight hundred miles of whimpering , " Mama , mama , mama " -a cry in triplicate that would seep , eventually , into , Lewis and Nathan 's every dream . Not that either one of them ever felt guilty " Ground rule , " Lewis told both boys after an unfriendly Dairy Queen waitress had handed them melting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't look back . Do what 's necessary , then barrel like an ox toward Christmas . " <p> " Chryslers , unfortunately , beg to be seen , " Lewis told his sons , and so they drove the back roads , viewing the most plug-ugly state Lewis and Nathan had ever witnessed  --  big muddy rivers and a played-out sky . Late afternoon came , and then twilight , and finally Lewis looked over and saw that both boys were asleep , rag soft and contorted on the seat next to him , boys who could fill up a space , make it fit their own needs . As he drove , he kept looking over at them , at the blond baby and the . dark , well-lessoned thirteen-year-old , and he imagined everything they would do : ski and rebuild engines , hang a Christmas pinata from the back tree , they would swim and cook eggs with Tabasco , grow some Indian corn . On and on it went in Lewis 's mind until he grew tender with the largeness of their lives , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chain link of stars glimmering above  --  they crossed the line into the sweet , big grainbelt of Kansas . <p> <p> By Dianne Nelson <p>
