Twenty-seven hospital field work programs in New York City were studied . Questionnaires were administered to program coordinators and 238 graduate social work students participating in study programs . High degrees of program structural complexity and variation were found , indicating a state of art well beyond that described in the general field work literature . High rates of student satisfaction with learning , field instructors , programs , and the overall field work experience found suggest that the complexity of study programs may be more effective than traditional field work models . Statistically nonsignificant study findings indicate areas in which hospital social work departments may develop field work programs consistent with shifting organizational needs , without undue risk to educational effectiveness . Statistically significant findings suggest areas in which inflexibility in program design may be more beneficial in the diagnostic related groups era . <p> Adoption of prospective systems for reimbursement of health care costs has produced considerable shifts both in the locus and focus of hospital social work services ( Kane , 1985 ; Rehr , 1985 ) . These shifts raise questions as to how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Little empirical data are available to hospital social work departments in redesigning the field work component of social work education to address changing needs . Caroff and Mailick ( 1985 ) conducted a national survey of graduate schools of social work to describe the organization and delivery of health care social work education in the classroom . However , no cross-sectional studies of organizational structures for providing the field work component of education for health care practice have been reported . Little is known about the range of field work program structures that can be found in hospitals , nor of their effectiveness in meeting educational and organizational needs . <p> Twenty-seven teaching hospital programs were studied ( Showers , 1988 ) . The author describes the state of the art in hospital field work program structural design found in New York City and considers implications for future design in the era of the diagnostic related groups ( DRG ) payment system . METHODOLOGY Sample <p> Twenty hospitals were selected for study in the spring of 1987 , comprising a nonprobability sample of the 57 area hospitals known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding academic year . Hospitals were selected based on variation in organizational characteristics and on estimated feasibility of enlisting program coordinator cooperation . Coordinators were hospital social work department personnel responsible for internal and external program coordination . The study sample was composed of 10 voluntary hospitals , six municipal hospitals , two Veterans Administration hospitals , and two state psychiatric hospitals . Twenty hospitals had 27 distinct field work programs . In all , 27 coordinators ( 100 percent ) and 238 of 278 ( 85.6 percent ) of masters ' level social work students in study programs completed questionnaires . Instruments <p> Two instruments were created for the study : ( 1 ) the Graduate Social Work Student Satisfaction Questionnaire and ( 2 ) the Hospital Field Work Coordinator Questionnaire . First , a framework for categorizing hospital field work program characteristics was developed , based on a field instruction typology proposed by Hamilton and Else ( 1983 ) . The study framework includes four categories of dimensions along which programs may vary : ( 1 ) characteristics related to accountability , ( 2 ) characteristics related to learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for teaching , and ( 4 ) characteristics related to field instructors . Items within categories were derived from the social work health care education literature , from the general field work research literature , from literature related to stress among social work students and hospital social workers , and from research literature on social work student satisfaction . <p> Both study questionnaires contain three major sections and an open-ended question asking for comments . The first section of each questionnaire contains items on student and program demographic variables . The second section contains questions about respondent satisfaction , with responses on a five-point scale ranging from " very dissatisfied " to " very satisfied . " The third section contains 50 items requesting respondent perceptions of the extent to which program characteristics were present . Responses on that section were measured on a five-point scale ranging from " much too little " to " much too much . " The design for measuring satisfaction and explanations for satisfaction was adapted from Raskins 's ( 1981 ) study of undergraduate social work student satisfaction with field work placements . Implementation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coordinators ' preferences . In most instances , questionnaires were mailed to coordinators for self- and student administration . Most coordinators administered student questionnaires during group meetings . The researcher administered questionnaires to student groups in four programs and mailed questionnaires directly to students in one other . Follow-up questionnaires were distributed by coordinators or mailed by the researcher to students who did not respond . <p> Associations between program characteristics and scaled satisfaction items were analyzed through ANOVA . For dichotomized items , correlation analysis was performed to determine strength and direction of associations . FINDINGS <p> Findings on students ' and coordinators ' perceptions and on the differences between perceptions of these two groups can be found elsewhere ( Showers , 1988 ) . Program characteristics and associations between characteristics and student satisfaction will be discussed here . Student and Coordinator Characteristics <p> Students from eight schools of social work participated in the study , with students from three schools comprising 84 percent ( n = 200 ) of the sample . Students ranged from 21 to 66 years of age , with a mean age of 31.5 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and racial minorities 15 percent ( n = 36 ) of the students . <p> Most coordinators ( 81.5 percent , n = 22 ) carried administrative status in their organizations ; the most frequent organizational title listed was assistant director of social work . Coordinator experience as field instructor ranged from 1 to 14 years , with a median of 6 years . The experience of coordinators as coordinators ranged from 0 to 16 years , with almost half ( 48.1 percent , n = 13 ) reporting 3 years or fewer . Thus , many of the coordinators were relatively new in leadership roles , and there was a slightly larger group of more established program leaders . The amount of time program coordinators allocated to the field work programs ranged from 5 percent to 50 percent , with a median of 20 percent . Additionally , more than 25 percent ( n = 7 ) of programs had assistant coordinators , who presumably allocated time to program administration . Almost half ( n = 13 ) of the coordinators reported serving as members of school of social work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments of social work donated was considerable . <p> In two-thirds of programs ( n = 18 ) , field instructors were accountable to program coordinators , rather than to department superiors , for matters related to student training . This arrangement indicates an emphasis on field instruction as teaching rather than as an apprenticeship . Student Satisfaction Rates <p> Fortune et al . ( 1985 ) found that graduate social work students placed in health care settings expressed significantly lower levels of satisfaction with supervisors and somewhat lower levels of satisfaction with other aspects of field work education than did students in other field work settings . They postulated that the stressful nature of complex interdisciplinary medical center settings produces lower levels of student satisfaction . <p> Many authors have noted the highly stressful nature of hospital placements ( Berkman , Kemler , Marcus , &; Silberman , 1985 ; Nelson , 1974 ; Rauch , 1984 ) . In a study of stress in graduate social work students , Munson ( 1984 ) found an inverse relationship between stress and satisfaction . <p> In the current study , student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of student satisfaction were used as outcome measures of organizational and educational effectiveness . Eighty-five percent ( n = 203 ) of students said they were satisfied with their learning , 79 percent ( n = 189 ) said they were satisfied with the field work experience , 75 percent ( n = 179 ) said they were satisfied with the field instructors , 74 percent ( n = 176 ) said they were satisfied with the field work program , and 56 percent ( n = 134 ) said they were satisfied with the hospital . All items were intercorrelated at p &lt; .01 level of significance , with correlation coefficients ranging from a high of .72 ( satisfaction with program and with the field work experience ) to a low of .34 ( satisfaction with hospital and with field instructors ) . Overall , these rates compared favorably with general field work satisfaction rates of 65 to 75 percent that Raskin ( 1981 ) cited , and the 71 to 81 percent rates Fortune et al . ( 1985 ) reported . <p> Although most students in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing too much stress in the field work placement , the primary effect appeared to be lower satisfaction with the placement hospital . Findings suggest that social work students in hospitals simultaneously experience both higher levels of stress and higher levels of satisfaction with field work than do students placed in other settings . <p> Student satisfaction can have organizational as well as educational implications for hospital social work departments . Field education gives providers a pool of known job applicants trained in organizational policies , procedures , and philosophy ( Wilson , 1981 ) . High satisfaction levels presumably make it more likely that students will remain as employees . Further , organizations gaining a reputation for providing quality field education will attract high-caliber students and the most competent graduates ( Schulz &; Gordon , 1977 ) . <p> In the present study , satisfied students were significantly more willing to accept a job at the host hospital , to believe that a job would be offered , and to recommend the field placement to other students . All but two relationships between the five scaled satisfaction items and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .05 . Thus , high student satisfaction appeared to affect significantly the ability to meet recruitment needs . <p> Statistically significant associations between program characteristics and student satisfaction variables were weak , with the highest r score at .24 . Overall , respondent perceptions and differences in perceptions about program characteristics showed much stronger associations with satisfaction than did program characteristics themselves ( Showers , 1988 ) . Program Characteristics <p> Program Accountability . In the framework developed for this study , the program accountability category included measures of program leadership and accountability systems . Variables include coordinator characteristics , use of written program policies and procedures , use of program evaluations written by students , and use of program evaluations written by field instructors . <p> Almost three-fourths of the programs ( 74.1 percent , n = 20 ) had written policies and procedures for accountability . More than half ( 59.3 percent , n = 16 ) obtained written evaluations from students . However , only a small minority ( 11.1 percent , n = 3 ) obtained written program evaluations from field instructors . Overall , accountability mechanisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of variables related to accountability , only coordinator experience as field instructor was associated with student satisfaction . Greater experience was negatively and weakly correlated with student satisfaction with learning ( r = - .14 , p &lt; .05 ) and with the field work experience ( r = - .14 , p &lt; .05 ) . <p> Learning Opportunities . Program characteristics related to learning opportunities included hospital type , hospital auspices , hospital size , size of social work department , social work department function , total number of social work students at all levels in training , external program funding , consortium participation , number of schools with students in placement , use of single or multiple assignments , use of single or multiple practice methods , assignment to inpatient and/or outpatient locations , assignment treatment type , length of client contact , and number of contacts with client systems . Study hospitals were large : 74 percent ( n = 19 ) had more than 500 certified beds . Departments had the equivalent of between 20 and 125 full-time staff members , with a median of 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per full-time staff member , with a median of 10.5 . About 70 percent ( n = 19 ) of social work departments carried official responsibility for the mandated discharge planning function ; 81 percent of students ( n = 193 ) were placed in departments that were charged with that function . <p> The scope of social work education reported was considerable . Coordinators reported having begun a total of 315 masters ' level students in placement during the academic year ; 278 remained at the time of the study . The extent of training in program hospitals for bachelor ( BSW ) and doctoral ( DSW ) level social work students , however , was limited . Only four programs reported BSW training , with a total of nine students . Only two hospitals reported having DSW students , with one in each . Only two programs reported receipt of external funding . Sixty-seven percent ( n = 18 ) participated in consortium activity , which connotes some pooling of resources by two or more programs , often in the form of joint teaching . The number of schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five , with a mean of 2.6 and median of 3 . <p> Seventy-four percent ( n = 177 ) of students reported training in multiple service areas . Students were assigned to diverse types of services , paralleling the increasing diversification of hospital and hospital social work services resulting from prospective finance systems . In addition to more traditional treatment programs in areas such as health , mental health , and substance abuse , students reported training in areas such as research , home care , discharge planning , public school outreach , working with the homeless , financial services , preventive services , employee assistance , victim abuse , geriatric community services , nursing homes , and community consultation and guidance programs . <p> The largest group of students ( 42 percent , n = 101 ) was assigned to both inpatient and outpatient settings . Slightly fewer students ( 35 percent , n = 83 ) were assigned only to outpatient locations . Twenty-two percent ( n = 52 ) had assignments only in inpatient service areas . Type of setting care provided also varied : the largest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned to some mixture of health , mental health , or other kinds of care areas . Slightly fewer students ( 34 percent , n = 81 ) were assigned only to psychiatric care areas . Twenty-four percent ( n = 58 ) were assigned only to medical care areas . <p> A large percentage of students ( 76.6 percent , n = 182 ) reported having trained in more than one social work method during placement . By far , the most common method combination was case work and group work : 149 students ( 63 percent ) reported that design . Thirteen percent ( n = 31 ) reported combinations of micro and macro methods . <p> Duration of work with client systems and numbers of contacts with clients also were examined . Almost 90 percent ( n = 212 ) of students worked with some client systems for at least 3 months . A large majority ( 69 percent , n = 168 ) had at least 13 contacts with some clients . These findings indicate that most students experienced variety in duration and number of contacts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Only five variables related to hospital and program learning opportunities were significantly associated with student satisfaction . Students placed in hospitals offering only medical or only psychiatric treatment were more satisfied with the hospital than were students in general hospitals ( r = .13 , p &lt; .05 ) . Students in voluntary hospitals were more satisfied with the hospital than were those in public hospitals ( r = .13 , p . &lt; .05 ) . Students in programs participating in consortia with other field work programs were more satisfied with learning ( r = .17 , p &lt; .01 ) and with the hospital ( r = .19 , p &lt; .01 ) than were those in programs not in a consortium . Students who used multiple methods were more satisfied with the field work program ( r = .22 , p &lt; .01 ) , with the hospital ( r = .11 , p &lt; .01 ) , and with the field work experience ( r = .22 , p &lt; .01 ) than were students trained only in a single method . The percentage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with satisfaction with the hospital ( r = .14 , p &lt; 05 ) . <p> Teaching Structure . The variables that measured structure for delivering field instruction included assignment to single or multiple field instructors , size of student group , group teaching or individual supervision only , frequency of student seminars , leadership of student seminars , content of student seminars , and contact with program personnel before start of field work . A large percentage of study programs were structured to provide for multiple field instructors , with 70 percent ( n = 19 ) using both primary field instructors and secondary or task supervisors . Twenty-six programs ( 96 percent ) reported a total of 314 staff members involved as field instructors , indicating sizable allocation of staff to social work education . Not all students in programs with multiple field instructors , however , were assigned to more than one . About 58 percent ( n = 138 ) of students reported that they were assigned to more than one instructor . <p> Student group size ranged from three to 27 , with a median of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the programs in this study had more than 12 students , the largest figure mentioned for any field work program in the literature reviewed . All programs provided group teaching in student seminars , with most ( 59 percent , n = 16 ) providing weekly seminars . Twenty-five programs ( 93 percent ) reported using multiple teachers for student seminars . Many social work staff of all departmental ranks were involved in group teaching , with smaller numbers of members from other disciplines participating . <p> Coordinators were asked to indicate the content of student seminars by checking from a list of nine content areas and listing additional content areas . Responses were assigned to three categories for analysis : ( 1 ) administrative content , including subjects such as hospital policies and procedures ; ( 2 ) didactic content , comprising content also likely to be taught in schools of social work , including subjects such as health care finance ; and ( 3 ) practice content , including subjects such as professional chart note writing , specific disease entities , and interdisciplinary functioning . Coordinators reported between zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a median of four . The number of didactic content areas reported ranged from zero to nine , with a median of two . The number of practice-related areas ranged from zero to five , with a median of two . The total number of content areas covered ranged from two to 13 , with a median of eight . <p> Both students and coordinators were asked to indicate what contact students had with program staff before the start of field work . Seventy percent ( n = 19 ) of programs and 64 percent of students ( n = 153 ) reported some student program contact before placement , with 48 percent of programs ( n = 13 ) and 40 percent of students ( n = 96 ) reporting individual or group meetings . <p> Five dimensions related to teaching structure were associated with student satisfaction . Students with multiple field instructors were more satisfied with the field work program than were those assigned to a single instructor ( r = .14 , p &lt; .05 ) . Students in programs whose coordinators reported face-to-face contact between program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfied with learning ( r = - .13 , p &lt; .05 ) , with the field work program ( r = - .14 , p &lt; .05 ) , and with the hospital ( r = - .17 , p &lt; .01 ) . Not all students in programs providing face-to-face contact , however , had such contact . No associations were found between student self-reports of face-to-face contact and satisfaction . Positive correlations were found between the number of practice-related areas included in student seminars and student satisfaction with learning ( r = .16 , p &lt; .01 ) and with the hospital ( r = .15 , p &lt; .05 ) . The total number of educational areas ( didactic plus practice ) was positively correlated with satisfaction with learning ( r = .12 , p &lt; .05 ) and with the hospital ( r = .20 , p &lt; .01 ) . The total number of content areas was positively correlated with satisfaction with learning ( r = .14 , p &lt; .05 ) and with the hospital ( r = .18 , p &lt; .01 ) . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correlated with student satisfaction with learning and with the placement hospital . <p> Field Instructors . Also explored were program dimensions related to field instructor characteristics and program provisions for supporting field instructors . Variables included instructor experience in field instruction , instructor departmental status , workload reduction for field instructors , existence of field instructor seminars and seminar frequency , instructors eligible for seminar participation , and seminar content . <p> The percentage of new primary field instructors reported both by students ( 21 percent , n = 49 ) and coordinators ( 27 percent , n = 60 ) is below the 45 percent reported by one school of social work ( Bogo , 1981 ) . The percentage of new secondary field instructors ( 25 percent , n = 26 ) is quite close to that for new primary instructors . The percentage of new primary instructors ranged from 0 to 67 percent , and the percentage of new secondary instructors ranged from 0 to 100 percent . Thus , although the overall rates are consistent for the groups of primary and secondary field instructors , considerable variation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary field instructors are similar , with about three-quarters of each group falling into the line social worker category ( 75 percent , n = 167 , and 79 percent , n = 81 , respectively ) . Only three coordinators reported that work-load reduction was provided to compensate for time given by field instructors . Hence , most programs ( 89 percent , n = 24 ) appeared to expect field instructors to contribute their own time to the educational endeavor . <p> Twenty-four programs provided seminars for field instructors , of which 16 programs held seminars monthly or less frequently . Program coordinators and/or assistant coordinators led seminars in 19 of the 24 programs . Of the 20 programs with secondary field instructors , eight excluded secondary instructors from seminars , seven included them in seminars with primary field instructors , four held separate seminars , and one held no seminars at all . <p> Responses to a question on content areas included in field instructor seminars were assigned to two categories for analysis : ( 1 ) administrative content , covering such areas as program planning and coordination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of field instruction technology such as assessing and responding to process recording . The number of administrative content areas reported ranged from one to five , the number of practice related content areas ranged from zero to five , and the number of total content areas ranged from three to 10 . <p> Four field instructor dimensions were associated with student satisfaction . Percentage of secondary field instructors with line worker status was positively correlated with student satisfaction with learning ( r = .20 , p &lt; .01 ) , with the field work program ( r = .19 , p &lt; .01 ) , with the hospital ( r = .21 , p &lt; .01 ) , and with the field work experience ( r = .16 , p &lt; .05 ) . Students in programs providing weekly or biweekly field instructor seminars were more satisfied with learning ( r = .24 , p &lt; .01 ) , with the program ( r = .14 , p &lt; .05 ) , with the hospital ( r = .18 , p &lt; .01 ) , and with the field work experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were students in programs in which seminars were held less frequently . A negative correlation was revealed between the number of administrative content areas included in field instructor seminars and student satisfaction with learning ( r = - .15 , p &lt; .05 ) . Finally , students in programs in which secondary field instructors were excluded from field instructor seminars were more satisfied with the hospital than were students in programs in which secondary field instructors were included ( r = .17 , p &lt; .05 ) . IMPLICATIONS FOR PROGRAM DESIGN <p> The DRG system is intended to force hospital administrators to examine the relative contributions of every unit to organizational functioning . Flexibility of design within units of field work programs , therefore , may be crucial to the ability of hospital social work departments to sustain high levels of field education while adapting to a changing environment . Statistically nonsignificant study findings indicate ' e number of dimensions along which hospital social work departments may design program structure consistent with organizational needs , without undue risk to student satisfaction . <p> Student satisfaction in this cohort was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of program or service areas , with medical or psychiatric setting , or with length or quantity of contact with client systems . These findings indicate that hospital social work departments may structure student placements flexibly in a spectrum of locations within hospital systems . This fact is important , given the centrality of the concept of location of health care delivery in prospective reimbursement theory . <p> Study findings also suggest that hospital social work departments can be flexible in employing single ' or ' multiple assignment design and in selecting field instructors . Number of assignments was not associated with any measure of satisfaction for individual students . Although program satisfaction was associated with being in a program offering multiple assignments , lack of association with other satisfaction measures leads to the conclusion that use of multiple assignments is less important than other factors . Nonsignificant findings related to field instructor experience indicate that students may be assigned to relatively inexperienced hospital field instructors or newer programs without significant risk to student satisfaction with field work . <p> Statistically significant findings of associations between program characteristics and satisfaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments may benefit from less flexibility in design . A consistent pattern of weak correlations between the numbers of content areas covered in student seminars and student satisfaction , for example , suggests that field curriculum may affect both educational and organizational outcome in crucial ways that the crude measure of counting topics could not detect . The universality of these seminars in study programs implies a strong perception that seminars are necessary to effective field work education in hospitals . Further research on the conceptual bases for these seminars , their specific content , and how that content relates to classroom teaching could provide a basis for understanding how such seminars may bridge gaps between classroom teaching and field learning . <p> The areas of satisfaction affected by provision of training in multiple methods suggest that assignment to more than one method furthers both educational and organizational goals . Relatively higher correlational strength indicates that training in multiple methods may be a comparatively strong strategy for enhancing student satisfaction through program design . Positive correlations between consortia participation and student satisfaction suggest that such participation may be a cost effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hospital programs . <p> Lastly , findings suggest that hospital field instructor seminars are instrumental in enhancing those field instructor characteristics or other program dimensions associated with greater student satisfaction . The relatively strong correlation between seminar frequency and student learning satisfaction indicates that this variable may be among the most important program characteristics studied . Further research on how those seminars are organized and delivered , their direct effects on field instructors , their indirect effects on students , and other ways in which seminars specifically affect field work delivery , is needed to evaluate organizational and educational costs and benefits of higher frequency . In the present study , about 30 percent of the programs ( n = 8 ) held seminars weekly or biweekly . For other hospitals , increasing the frequency would require increased staff allocation , at a cost to other responsibilities . More information on the value of agency-run field instructor seminars would aid in decision making about this kind of resource allocation . <p> Overall , the degree of structural complexity and variation found indicates a state of art in hospital field work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education literature , which generally focuses upon the triad of faculty field liaison-field instructor-student as the key structural unit for field instruction delivery ( Fellin , 1982 ; Gordon , 1982 ; Hamilton &; Else , 1983 ; Rosenblum and Raphael , 1983 ) . Study programs showed considerable complexity in administrative hierarchy , with program coordinators , assistant coordinators , and field instruction teams characteristic of many programs , and most field instructors accountable to educational coordinators rather than to departmental supervisors for performance in the field instructor role . Many departmental staff representing all organizational levels were involved in program administration , primary and secondary field instruction , group teaching of students , and field instructor seminars . Most programs featured learning assignment and teaching structures considerably more complex than reflected by the triad model : student seminars , multiple field instructors , and multiple structured learning experiences were commonplace . Variation in program characteristics was noted within as well as among programs . <p> High levels of student field work satisfaction in these programs suggest that the hospital field work program design that characterizes those programs is both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to social work education . <p>
