txt // thought to need in their own homes or in their employers ' , if they were in domestic service . There were a few training schools which took girls , such as the National and Industrial Schools at Finchley which produced their own manuals of industry ' in the 1840s , setting out in catechism form the duties of female servants . In 1842 the St John 's Servants ' School opened , with about a hundred female pupils and another thirty in its Brighton branch . The girls did all the chores except the laundry and were taught reading , writing , arithmetic , needlework and household work ( Baylis , 1857 ) . Places in such schools were not free , and although employers were enthusiastic and would have liked more such schemes there was no great supply of paid-for recruits ( Attar , 1987 ) . The Committee of the Privy Council for the direction of education considered giving grants to schoolmistresses who taught domestic economy in the national schools in 1860 , but decided against because of the expense and the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools ought to concentrate on needlework ( Yoxall , 1913 ) . Although a few schools continued to teach domestic economy , it was as a theoretical subject . More practical instruction was given to girls in orphanages and charitable institutions ' , who were usually explicitly destined for domestic service . One of the earliest school textbooks on domestic economy was William Tegetmeier 's A manual of domestic economy , published originally before 1858 and reaching its thirteenth edition by 1891 . It was prepared under the direction of the Committee of the Home and Colonial School Society ' , presumably for use in their schools . Tegetmeier was a lecturer at the Society 's training institution ; he was also a naturalist and a friend of Charles Darwin . His Manual appeared to be written for the ultimate benefit of the labouring classes , but in the first instance for the benevolent middle classes . It included both a diagram of an ideal ' cottage for an agricultural labourer 's family , and an appendix of instructions for visitors to the poor which advised the lady visitor : You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their relative duties , and avail yourself of suitable opportunities of reproving open vice . ' At first the Boards of Education did not at all favour the introduction of domestic economy into the curriculum . This makes the arguments that the state set out deliberately to promote an ideology of home and motherhood aimed at keeping the working classes snugly free from rebellion and sending women back to their homes from the labour // market - the critical view - or else aimed at improving their health and skills from a mixture of well-meaning concern and self-interest - the traditional view - somewhat problematic . Schools were obliged to continue teaching needlework to girls , but there was a good deal of resistance to the introduction of other domestic subjects , as Yoxall described . Teaching was offered first of all on a voluntary basis by the training schools which were set up and spread rapidly from 1873 onwards , but for several years practical domestic subjects , and domestic economy as a theoretical subject , were not officially recognised or fnded . According to Yoxall , the London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by postponing fifteen times its consideration of the motion that ... it is desirable to promote a knowledge of plain cookery and of the household operations connected therewith as part of the elementary education of girls ' , before finally accepting it in June 1874 - four years after elementary education became compulsory for all under the 1870 Education Act . The domestic subjects were accepted piecemeal into the elementary-school curriculum , at intervals between 1875 and 1894 , as subjects which qualified for grants under the Education Department 's Codes . Pioneers such as Fanny Calder in Liverpool and Catherine Buckton , who stood for election to the Leeds School Board with the express intention of working for the acceptance of domestic economy teaching , campaigned for the subjects to be given serious consideration , to be organised and funded properly by the education authorities in their areas , and success was only gradual . The introduction of the clutch of domestic subjects which eventually became home economics resulted less from deliberate centralised state planning than from the work of a coalition of interest groups . A movement to promote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meeting at congresses and conferences and helping to set up the first domestic economy teacher training college , the National Training School of Cookery , which opened in 1874 . At the beginning there were a number of men involved in the movement , who appear to have come from three groups . Some were science teachers , such as Thomas Cartwright , author of Domestic science ( 1900 ) , William Jerome Harrison , author of The science of home life ( 1882 ) and Henry Major , who lectured in chemistry and physiology , was an inspector for the Leicester School Board and also wrote several books on domestic economy . Others were // doctors with an interest in promoting the teaching of hygiene , like the author of Domestic economy for schools ( 1881 ) , Dr J. Milner Fothergill , and more notably Sir Arthur Newsholme , who also co-wrote one of the standard textbooks on domestic economy and later became President of the Society of Medical Officers of Health . A third group were clergymen , such as the Reverend John Faunthorpe , Principal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1881 ) . There were also one or two eminent men who lent their names and titles to the cause ; the most prominent was the Duke of Westminster , the first president of the National Training School of Cookery . Middle-class women , almost by definition , constituted an interest group as employers of servants ( although it is easy to exaggerate the extent to which the middle class was able to rely on servants : see McBride , 1976 ) . There were other reasons for middle-class women to take an interest : teaching domestic skills and preaching the virtues of domesticity to the lower classes through the elementary schools offered a way of continuing by other means a tradition of middle-class female philanthropy , previously pursued through poor visiting , health visiting , membership of various sanitary and national health societies - even through the distribution of tracts . As Prochaska ( 1980 ) points out , middle-class women involved in philanthropic work - as many were - were used to training servants ; it was a field in which they already had some expertise . ( One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books for mistresses explaining how they should treat and train their servants , as well as textbooks on domestic economy for elementary-school girls . ) While women were still unable to vote , they were able for the first time to take a public role as members of School Boards , and it was natural for many of them to draw on their existing skills and interests . Single women had a particular interest in the expansion of domestic subjects teaching at a time when the so-called surplus woman ' question was much discussed and there was a pressing need to find new areas of female employment . The appallingly inadequate education of middleclass girls and the current heavy emphasis on domesticity left many of them trapped , at a time when some households were facing financial insecurity as a result of the economic recession and feminists were urging parents to face the fact that not all their daughters would marry ( Bryant , 1979 ) . The feminist campaign for access to higher education and to the // professions for women was meeting fierce opposition ; as Dyhouse ( 1981 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls to follow the same secondary-school curriculum as boys would injure their health . Against this background , some women looked for new types of employment which they already knew something about , which would enable them to support themselves without losing their class status entirely , and which would not bring down on them too much masculine wrath . One solution was to write about what they knew . The journalist Eliza Warren , in How I managed my house on two hundred pounds a year ( 1864 ) , inveighed against the silly sinful dogma ' that it was wrong for a lady to earn her own bread and recommended to other women suffering widowhood or bankruptcy her own example of turning her housekeeping knowledge into paid work . She advocated both writing for the women 's domestic magazine market and another way of capitalising on domestic expertise , becoming a lady-help ' . The lady-help was to be a superior type of servant , who could live in and work as a cook , maid or housekeeper without abandoning her claim to gentility . Between 1870 and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady-helps ' led to the establishment of an Office of Lady Helps ' in London ( Prochaska , 1980 ) and even to a number of training homes for them - one in Cheltenham was called a Guild of Dames of the Household ' ( Marris , 1904 ) , but such schemes reached few ladies and did not last . Domestic education offered much more scope for the energetic domestic reformers . Ailsa Yoxall attributed the inspiration for the National Training School to a somewhat arbitrary event , J. Buckmaster 's 1873 series of lectures on cookery , which started a craze for learning to cook . The novelty of these lectures lay first in their association of cookery with science - Buckmaster was no cook himself but a science lecturer and the science of cooking was a new subject for him ' ; a French chef with four women under him ' performed the simultaneous demonstrations - and secondly in the idea of putting cookery on public display . They appear to have provided just the right excuse for those women whose activities had been circumscribed by the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite nice ' to begin taking domestic training seriously . The National Training School , often known simply as the National , began as a cookery school in 1873 , patronised by fashionable and wealthy women . From 1875 onwards it gave more emphasis to its // teacher training courses , which were originally only three months long . The National 's influence was enormous . It trained many of the women who went on to found or to head other schools of cookery and domestic economy around the country - such as Mrs M. Black , who became principal of the Glasgow Training School , and Marguerite Fedden , who was principal of St Martha 's . It provided the first certificates for would-be domestic economy and cookery teachers and also exported its demonstration method , which became the standard format for teaching cookery in schools . Tegetmeier 's Scholar 's handbook ( 1876 ) , commissioned by the London School Board once domestic economy had been officially recognised as a grant-earning ' specific subject ' , included an appendix of recipes used by the teachers of the National Training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to follow was divided into three stages . Food was studied in all of them , beginning with some vaguely scientific theory and ending with rules for cookery . In Stage I girls studied ' Food ; its composition and nutritive value . Clothing and washing ' ; in Stage II ' Food ; its functions . The Dwelling , warming , cleaning , and ventilation ' ; and in Stage III ' Food ; its preparation and culinary treatment . Rules for health ; the management of a sick room ' . Teaching was often by rote and girls were expected to memorise their lessons , which mingled moral exhortations with scientific or pretendscientific explanation , and with prescriptive advice . In her chapters on washing in Textbook of domestic economy ( 1885 ) , for example , Elizabeth Rice explained to pupils that ' Water is a clear , colourless , transparent fluid , composed of oxygen and hydrogen gas ... Soda is prepared by a chemical process from sea salt and certain acids . ' Her ' useful hints ' included sorting the washing ' in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the sight of dirty clothes ' and tying on ' a nice white apron ' before folding clean clothes . Her instructions , and the questions for pupils to answer , were often minutely detailed : ' Give two directions to be attended to in hanging out clothes to dry ' ; ' What three things should be borne in mind when folding ? ' As domestic subjects teaching expanded to take up more room in the curriculum for girls , practical cookery was provided as a separate subject in 1882 , and laundrywork in 1890 . The domestic reformers had a number of obstacles to overcome to achieve this , including opposition // from parents who thought the teaching a waste of time . Because of the cost , the amount of actual cooking pupils could do was always restricted . Courses were criticised both for being inadequately scientific and for being too abstract and irrelevant to pupils ' actual home lives . When the period of the Codes ended there was something of a backlash , with teachers in some cases trying to bring their subject down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary Hill in Sheffield set her pupils to polish their desks and clean the classroom windows . They practised the correct use of a broom and were even visited by a vacuum cleaner salesman . In her account of the lessons , she wrote : The work was always approached as some aspect of home life , never as so-called " Domestic Science " which , alas , is frequently very doubtful science with nothing " domestic " about it at all ' ( Hill , 1914 ) . There is no way we can determine how far the reformers seriously believed that tuition in domestic subjects would improve the lives and health of the working class or even influence behaviour , but such beliefs can not have been supported by much actual evidence . Weddell , for example , maintained that laundrywork partly came to be introduced as a school subject because of the dirty state of the girls who turned up to cookery classes , and Yoxall described how a scheme of lessons in laundrywork was initially planned and organised by Mrs E. Lord , after taking private lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superintendent of laundrywork to the London School Board . ) Yet as Smith ( 1979 ) notes , working-class children would often have possessed only one set of clothes . The schemes of work set out in laundrywork textbooks were fantastically unrealistic in the context of crowded homes without running water , and of the working lives of many women . The argument that working-class girls wore dirty clothes purely because they or their mothers were ignorant of laundrywork is no more tenable than the argument that women 's ignorance was to blame for the low-quality diet of the poor , yet such ideas were used to justify the displacement of other school subjects , for girls , by still more domestic training . One aim of the reformers in advocating domestic subjects teaching in elementary schools had been to rehabilitate ' domestic service , as Augusta Webster put it in her discussion of the 1878 Domestic Economy Congress ( Webster , 1879 ) . The so-called servant problem , for employers , was not so much an actual shortage of servants as a shortage // of trained and contented servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of employment . Newsholme anti Scott ( 1894 ) recommended teachers to advise mothers that their daughters should be encouraged to become good domestic servants in preference to entering upon indifferent callings which frequently entail late hours , injury to health and exposure to temptation ' ( in fact servants often had to work long and late hours ) . Domestic service continued to provide a large proportion of the jobs available to women , accounting for 44 per cent of the female workforce in 1881 and 40 per cent in 1901 , but it was in long-term decline and young girls leaving school were tending to avoid it ( Burnett , 1974 ) . Even as vocational training for domestic service , domestic subjects teaching can not be shown to have been useful or effective . Domestic subjects teaching was certainly intended in some quarters to have immediate practical effects , but it is doubtful whether it had much success in inculcating skills or altering patterns of domestic work . Working-class women had too little room to manoeuvre for their lives to be much altered by the instruction they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were ideological in the sense that domestic economy itself came to be promoted as a subject worthy of academic study ; that schools took on the role of judges of domestic performance , grading and classifying girls according to their housewifely skills , or lack of them ; that an elaborate model of the daily round of work in the home was built up and presented as the way things should be done , down to the smallest details . Its most serious effect was that it controlled - and limited - working-class girls ' access to a general education , to the point where it was accepted that half a girl 's time in her last year at school should be allocated to lessons and practical work in the home-making centre ' ( Bidder and Baddeley , 1901 ) . Domestic subjects also served to differentiate the education of middleclass girls from that of boys . The conflicts which developed over the introduction of domestic subjects into secondary education for middleclass girls are discussed in later chapters : they were more explicitly concerned with the question of whether girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the struggle , which was largely lost ( Manthorpe , 1986 ) , to construct a domestic science ' which could substitute for other science teaching . It is no coincidence that the period when domestic subjects were taught without much controversy , from 1944 to // the mid 1960s , was also the period when feminism was comparatively dormant . During that time there appears not to have been much debate Tout the acceptability of teaching housecraft - as it was then called - to girls in the secondary modern schools , and in a relatively calm atmosphere they cooked , cleaned , washed and sewed for a substantial period of their school days . Schools which had been set up with the needs of non-academic ' pupils in mind were equipped in accordance with the recommendations of the Hadow Report of 1926 and the Newsom Report of 1963 , with facilities for training girls in practical domestic work . It was all very matter-of-fact . Enid McIntosh , chairman sic of the ATDS in 1955 , wrote simply : Secondary modern schools are designed for pupils who learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integral factor in their education Housecraft is also creative , and offers a means of self-expression and an outlet for the emotions . Most secondary modern schools make every effort to include it on the curriculum , and to give as much time to it as conditions allow ... ( McIntosh , 1955 , p. 77 ) A four-year course in housecraft in a secondary modern school should give girls sufficient knowledge and experience of the basic techniques of cookery , laundrywork and cleaning to carry out normal household work ' . In servantless households , chores had to be fitted in alongside each other ( and along with caring for children , who were curiously absent from much domestic economy and housecraft teaching ) . The concepts of sequencing ' and dovetailing ' were developed within housecraft teaching , requiring that practical operations should be timed and slotted into a schedule . Practical examinations took up this idea - from the early 1950s pupils could take GCE Housecraft , but before the school-leaving age was raised in 1972 many pupils in secondary modern schools left before taking exams . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amongst teachers and pupils about finishing work on time . Many teachers commented that the time they were allocated was inadequate , but they would still have to plan work which left pupils in a panic about completing their cooking and clearing up before the bell went . Girls rushed about their chores anxiously clock-watching and with continual reminders from the teacher : You should have started by now ' ; Only half an hour left ' ; You 've got ten minutes , ' ladies ' ; You should be clear48 Wasting Girls ' Time ing up by now ' . These lesson patterns have not evolved by chance , or as an unavoidable response to rigid timetabling . They are based on a model of home economics teaching as itself a model of the housewife 's day : girls rush to get meals on the table just as they are later supposed to do for hungry and impatient husbands returning from work . Another new idea in housecraft teaching in the post-war period was aesthetics , as with increasing affluence taste ' in furnishings and decora-tion became more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with rescuing the thriftless poor from deplorable condi-tions , and more to do with creating ideal homes as a setting for happy family life ' . Money was for spending , rather than saving . As Christine Daniels noted ( 1980 ) , home economics became involved with the growth of the consumer movements of the 1950s and 1960s and the concept of the home and the family as consuming units began to appear in home economics examination syllabuses . ' Craft skills were still paramount ? this was the period when home economics really did appear to mean stitching and stirring ' . Home economics practitioners became even more concerned about teaching correct methods ' of practical work , narrowing an already straitened sub-ject further . Winifred Hargreaves 's model of craft skills teaching is an ex-ample of the closed world home economics teachers inhabited at this time ( Hargreaves , 1966 ) . It included statements which make little sense taken by themselves ( for example that for all crafts a knowledge of recipe ' material or textures and flavours is needed ) and an account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worldwide , every-day activity . Hargreaves maintained that accuracy , use of tools and machinery , cleanliness , working procedures and order , use of recipe and reference material , textures and flavours , pace of work , standards of finish and presentation , creative ability and experience as a buyer and consumer were basic to a knowledge of all crafts ' : Accuracy ... in a subject based on scientific principles pupils need to be taught that exact weighing , measuring , temperature control and timing are of first importance , then by their own experiments prove that sub-standard results may be due largely to their own inaccuracies . Evidently she was referring to cookery as the important craft , yet // elsewhere Hargreaves challenged its privileged status within home economics : The time given to cookery versus other competitors can easily get out of proportion . An exercise of self-revelation frequently shows that many pupils during a housecraft course spend 90 per cent of their time on cookery . During this time girls ' work was to be subjected to the teacher's. appraisal , with no room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-standard ' . Many teachers now are relieved that they are no longer likened to a judge at an agricultural show who looks for the best lemon meringue pie or victoria sandwich cake ' ( Coles , 1987 ) , but some system of judging pupils ' end products is still integral to the subject . Hargreaves , in the mid 1960s , took for granted that home economics was largely a girls ' subject , as did other authors well into the 1970s , when gender was at last discovered as a problem . The reinvention of home economics which this provoked is discussed in the next chapter ; the last section of this chapter is concerned with the implications of separate spheres , and with what happens within schools where women teachers provide , and pupils study , a subject which is known to be for girls . Whatever its supposed merits , home economics teaching displaces the reaching of other subjects which are perforce crowded out of the curriculum . As Augusta Webster noted in A housewife 's opinions ( 1879 ) , when domestic economy teaching was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studying domestic subjects they are not learning anything else . This was more evident to Webster at a time when girls were forced to take domestic subjects rather than , say , mathematics , science , geography or a foreign language , than it may be to observers now . Although during the examination years , from fourteen to sixteen , only a minority of pupils opt to study home economics , it is a sizeable minority : more than a hundred and seventy-five thousand girls leaving school in England during the school year 1986-7 had attempted CSE or GCE in domestic or commercial studies . Fewer had attempted physics , chemistry , CDT , French , history , geography , creative arts or even biological sciences . Inevitably , opting for home economics means that girls have to drop other subjects . The problem of gender stereotyping can be restated as a // question of access - as long as the curriculum includes such a clearly gendered ' subject as home economics , how much access do girls have to the rest of the curriculum ? It is self-evident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pupils to study others , but in this respect home economics can be seen as a special case , both because in the past there was a deliberate intention to teach it to girls instead of letting them take other lessons , and because offering a choice which includes a subject seen as for girls ' presents pupils with choice which can not be experienced as neutral . School subjects have not acquired their gender labels in isolation , bu in relation to each other . In the absence of a subject seen so definitively as a girls ' subject ' it would be easier for girls to see other subjects in th curriculum as less masculine ' , but the existence of home economics in schools changes the whole nature of girls ' formal education , whether o not they opt to study it . It alters perceptions of the curriculum as whole , and affects their access to education . There is some point her in asking the hypothetical question : what would have happened i domestic subjects had never been taught formally in elementary and secondary schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very different , and the social effects of allowing girls access to the same education given to boys unquantifiable . This alone has provided a powerful negative reason for teaching domestic subjects , and it was an argument put forward quite explicitly in the last century by those who saw no good reason to teach girls anything else ( David , 1980 ) . In coeducational schools , home economics teaching has resulted in the creation of women-only and girls-only spaces . This in itself may attract girls to the subject , just as the men-only and boys-only spaces within which CDT and to a lesser extent the hard ' sciences are taught appear to repel girls . In this context it is not so much the perceived femininity ' or masculinity ' of the subjects themselves producing an effect as the at traction of a secure space where girls may feel at ease as opposed to classrooms and workshops where they are likely to be disparaged , in-timidated or even harassed ( see , for example , Grant , 1983 ) . The sentiment which has been wrapped around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is reminiscent of the image o women in primary teaching as substitute mothers , which has been analysed by Valerie Walker-dine and Carolyn Steedman . Both have writ-ten about women in primary schools trapped into impossible nurturant // roles . Steedman ( 1985 ) writes of women imprisoned ' by expectations of their mothering role : ' I did n't know about a set of pedagogic expectations that covertly and mildly - and never using this vocabulary - hoped that I might become a mother . ' Walkerdine ( 1986 ) argues that the quasi-maternal nurturance ' required from , and offered by , women teachers disguises and denies power relations . This maternal nurturance ' - fostered in and taught to girls and women - moreover pathologises activity and passion . Needs replace desire ' . These critiques of the quasi-maternal roles into which women teachers are trapped could equally apply to the advice which prospective or actual teachers of home economics received in the past . Teachers were encouraged to act in ways which could be ( and often were ) seen as usurping the mother 's role ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways supplanted that of the mother . In the mid sixties girls considering a career as domestic science teachers were told that they should be good at home crafts , and that a neat , pleasing appearance and an attractive voice are advantages since many children model themselves on their teacher and the impression of her personality may last all their lives ' ( Crease , 1965 ) . Margaret Clark 's hook on teaching cookery ( 1970 ) spelt out the role of the home economics teacher in teaching socially acceptable ' modes of speech , behaviour and dress : The housecraft teacher can do a great deal both by class work or by individual help to guide girls towards good taste in clothes . ' Such social training , once taken for granted as well within the domain of home economics , may lead to a view of the pupil 's home background as inadequate , or may be predicated on such a view . Barbara Wynn ( 1983 ) argued that although good grooming ' books for schools were still being produced , such biased trivia can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is how the image of the home economics teacher as well-groomed super-housewife , setting an example for the girls , can be rooted out . If home economics teachers are to teach basic living skills ' , as Wynn advocated , their image is likely to remain that of efficient would-be role models . They will continue to represent an approved version of femininity , whether their basic skills ' teaching duplicates or contradicts what pupils have already learned at home . Teachers obliged to focus their teaching on the home and family will always be placed in a situation of challenging , or replicating , the // informal teaching pupils receive in their own homes , usually from mothers . Just as the home economics teacher appears to have been asked to fill a maternal role in secondary schools similar to the one which Walkerdine and Steedman suggest primary teachers were expected to play , so the home economics department can be seen through the writing of some commentators as a substitute home within the school , to be made available in particular for inadequate ' pupils but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Wendy house in an infants ' classroom - a retreat , as well as a place to play house . These perceptions of home economics teachers and of the spaces where they teach as representing something different from mainstream teaching and classrooms seem to offer something valuable to pupils : lessons which are not like lessons , teachers who are more like mothers , classrooms which are kitchens or other areas where girls can make themselves at home . I have seen girls who were silent , withdrawn and clearly unhappy in other lessons appearing relaxed and confident as they worked with just a few other girls in the comparatively secure environment of a home economics room . Yet there can be no justification for schools where girls need to use the option of a girls ' subject to gain some respite from neglect , hostility or abuse in other lessons , even at the cost of limiting their future career or academic options . Schools have passed to home economics teachers and departments functions which ought to be the responsibility of the school , and the curriculum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which girls can claim as their own , where they can feel comfortable and which is easy for them to opt for , has distracted attention for too long from the overdue task of ensuring that they do not find themselves in such need of a retreat , and can see the whole curriculum as legitimately theirs . 3 Reinventing Home Economies As home economics carries on through its forced changes , it sometime . takes on strange shapes . One fourth-year pupil I met , Maxine , who wm taking GCSE Child Development , told me she liked her course apn from having had to make a stuffed cat . She said that part had been boring and she had n't enjoyed it at all . In a different school Maxine might have had more luck : pupils in one school I visited were sometimes timetablcd to use the woodwork room for the practical assignment which required them to make an item for a child . But Maxine 's experience seemed fairly typical , since in many schools this feature of the syllabus provided the easiest way of constructing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the course . Making a soft toy has thus become a common feature of GCSE Child Development courses . It can be argued that Maxine learned something about child development from making the stuffed cat , and course providers have to claim exactly that . It can also be argued that she would have learned more from a direct approach which did not use up so much time ( a double lesson a week for half a term ) and did not leave her feeling so bored . But Maxine 's teacher did not have the freedom to choose the best approach , for her subject had been deliberately limited . The point of the stuffed cat was not so much what it taught about child development as what it taught about home economics as a school subject . In one sense , Maxine was compelled to make the cat by the previous Secretary of State for Education and Science , who had directly intervened in the debate about the framework for GCSE Home Economics subjects . Soft toys recently became so important an element of the study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular model of home economics . // The newest frameworks for home economics teaching are the end result of a process which began in the 1970s prompted by the second wave ' of feminism . The Sex Discrimination Act , which became law in 1975 , made it illegal for coeducational schools to limit access to courses to pupils of one sex only . This did not mean that girls-only courses in home economics , or boys-only craft and technology courses , immediately disappeared . As Miriam David ( 1980 ) pointed out , the law was not strongly enforced , although the discrimination it was supposed to prevent was extremely widespread . A 1975 survey by HM Inspectorate had reported : ... all schools provided some special subjects for boys and some for girls . Girls were invariably provided with female courses such as home economics and needlework and boys with craftwork ... Childcare , child development , mothercare and homemaking are usually regarded as the province of girls ' . ( David , 1980 , pp. 227-8 , quoting a DES report of 1975 ) There were no overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years later the Equal Opportunities Commission gave evidence to the Education , Science and Arts Committee that on average they received one complaint a week in term time about the denial of equal access to the curriculum for girls and boys ( House of Commons , 1981 ) , which of course also meant that pupils were still being forced to take subjects appropriate ' to their sex . A more immediate effect of the law was the pressure felt by some organisations , particularly examination boards and educational publishers , to repackage home economics as a mixed ' subject . Even if in practice it was being studied mostly by girls and taught almost exclusively by women - men constituted no more than 1 per cent of the home economics teaching staff in 1977 ( Arnot , 1984 , p.43 ) - gender somehow had to be made to disappear . In 1975 the Schools Council set up a three-year research project , Home economics in the middle years ' . The first of its aims was to reconsider the place of home economics in the curriculum of 8 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ article on the work of the team , Vincent Hutchinson explained that it decided that the focus of home economics ought to be on home and family . This neatly solved the problem of gender , simply by not referring to the specific role of women in the family or the specific work of women in the home . The ideal took over from the real once again : to replace the old imagery of cosy // domestic perfection with the housewife in her proper place , a non-sexist world which did not yet exist was conjured up for pupils ' consumption . A shift of focus was not enough on its own to solve the problem of redefining home economics in the new context of equal opportunities . The traditional components of the subject were there because they were all aspects of women 's work . Once this link could no longer be acknowledged , there was no longer any obviously close connection between the crafts of cooking and sewing , or between the theoretical study of food and that of textiles . There was an urgent need for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The research project , having found that the content of home economics was presented in too fragmentary a form ' , decided on ' a framework of key concepts related to the focus ' ( Hutchinson , 1979 , p.76 ) . The team identified ' five concepts : nutrition , protection , development , interdependence and management . These concepts , they decided , were interrelated . At the time of their research the idea of integrated studies had become part of the most up-to-date thinking behind curriculum reform in many secondary schools . In adopting a unified field ' approach , home economists were using the current educational vocabulary at the same time as working out how to make sense of the separate subjects within home economics as parts of a whole subject which made no reference to women 's work . There had already been many other attempts to construct such a model in response to the perennial identity problem of home economics . In 1973 the ATDS journal Housecraft published a series of articles on the identity of home economics ' . The authors , Middlemas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagram of overlapping circles which represented affective appreciations , psycho-motor skills , physical resources and cognitive appreciation . On its own this could be applied to almost any field of human activity - building a wall , playing the saxophone , fixing a car , writing a poem - but this was not the authors ' intention . Middlemas and Fry used their model to elaborate on their definition of home economics as the processes by which various resources , and the interactions of these resources , are purposefully organised and managed within and about the central focus of a residential building , to promote the development , wellbeing and interests of the occupant family ' . They illustrated the workings of their model in a description of : // a meal in its fullest conceptualisation . A meal , as it appears on the table , is the result of physico-chemical reactions between food materials induced by the cook exercising her sic psycho-motor skills with the aid of appropriate tools and energy sources . Engaging in these operations with some measure of success can afford pleasure to the cook and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The meal , when eaten serves a bio-functional purpose but at the same time , the consumer can derive pleasure from the perceptual qualities of the meal and of the setting in which it is served . Any overt expression of this appreciation confirms and adds to the satisfaction of the cook and the whole situation at the table and accommodates social interactions . ( Middlemas and Fry , 1973 , p. 436 ) I have quoted from this article at length , not because of its ludicrous language or its use of technical jargon to make us think we understand less about our everyday lives than we really do , but because it shows how attempts to explain the identity of home economics have served merely as disguised justifications for the status quo . Middlemas and Fry , in seeking to claim that home economics can claim a particular identity , constructed a model of difference ' which could in fact have been applied to almost anything else . It could not in itself explain anything about the specific nature of home economics . The one feature which could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics , was the territory in which it was located : the residential building with its occupant family , around whose development , well-being and interests the subject revolved . This essential limiting factor had simply to be taken for granted , since the claims of the building or the occupant family to such separate attention did not rest on any justification . The fullest conceptualisation ' of Middlemas 's and Fry 's exemplary meal time is as interesting for what it leaves out as for what it includes . There are no power relations , apparently , to trouble the mutually pleasurable happy family occasions where free-floating carers and appreciative diners meet and interact . The food arrives as empty of meaning and context-free as it is no doubt additive-free , for the cook to prepare purely in accordance with her own wishes and skills . I have never eaten such a meal , not because I have lived in especially quarrelsome households but because the constraints the authors fail to acknowledge have always been much more in evidence than the harmonious interplay they prefer to consider . The warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of labour , which is not in reality // a matter of mutuality or free choice , is left out . The language of the article is covertly coercive : this is what I should aim for at meal times . Life is supposed to be like this . Even more striking is the authors ' inability to explain the home economist ' as anything other than the housewife . They suggest , as a humorous aside , that their model might interestingly be applied ' to other adult members of the family ( who are not specified ) or to children , but continue : However , our particular concern here is with that one member of the family who usually takes the major responsibility for running the home - the housewife . ' Thus one of their circles , representing cognitive appreciation , is also used to symbolise the competence of the individual ' , understood to be the housewife who takes ' her role as if freely , rather than has it imposed on her . The model ' turns out to be less an explanation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housewife 's domestic skills placed in the foreground . In a later example , Eleanor Vaines made a more elaborate attempt to produce a model , using the concept of home economics - which , she explained , is still struggling to define its identity ' - as a unified field ' ( Vaines , 1979 , p.12 ) . According to Vaines , a considerable amount of energy had already been devoted to defining this field ; she referred to the work of home economists from the late nineteenth and early twentieth century , and also from the 1960s and 1970s . This chronological pattern of anxiety is , as I have already noted , a curious but unmistakable reflection of wider concerns about the role of women . Vaines 's part in the debate was an attempt to bring together the idea of a unified field , which she maintained was a social system bound together by common themes , with a potentially contradictory idea of home economists as specialists . Her proposed model had five subsystems . The focus of the first was on content , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their immediate environment . The focus of the second was on tools , of the third the home economist 's human development , and of the fourth the human services which home economists deliver . The title of the final sub-system was The mission of home economics ' , and its focus was the integration of the other systems . There were divided views , Vaines acknowledged , on whether home economics was a collection of specialisms or some kind of whole - a division which could have real and serious consequences for practitioners , // especially teachers . The problem with Vaines 's attempted resolution wa that it did no more than stake a claim that home economics could b both at once . Her sentences There are common themes which bind th whole of the social system of home economics ' and Each hom economist within the social system is a specialist of some kind ' wer given prominence in the text and printed in capitals ( Vaines , 1979 , p 13 ) , yet having read and reread her text I still do not know what thes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down These various attempts to develop and explain concepts of hom economics , with their complex abstractions , can make little sense to most people outside the home economics community . It is not surprisin that they have made hardly any impact on the perceptions of pupils parents and others . They deal with a problem which is simply not a rea problem for anyone else . I have no trouble with the identity of home economics : I have not had to struggle with its meanings , goals or links It costs me no great mental effort to construct a link between a pile o washing and a meal waiting to be cooked , or even between a stuffed ca and a small child . Why have the home economists and theorists found it so tortuously difficult ? It can only be because they are forced to refuse the obvious links and invent others for reasons of status , of professiona or academic standing , and ultimately for political reasons over which they have had little control . A consensus of sorts eventually emerged from the many efforts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The separate subjects within home economics first had to be changed from practical domestic skills to a skills-based study of concepts , which could then be linked by common themes ' . This was the approach taken in the HMI publication Home Economics from 5 to 16 ( 1985 ) , which categorised three main areas of home economics : home and family , nutrition and food , and textiles . The subject 's objectives , in turn , came under three headings : values and attitudes , knowledge and concepts , and skills . The work of the Committee and of the Schools Council paved the way for the GCSE National Criteria ( 1986 ) , which used much the same language and laid down officially how home economics was to be taught for pupils between fourteen and sixteen , without gender or other bias . The GCSE National Criteria for Home Economics is the most recent redefinition of the subject , and the current official version for use in British schools . Its similarity to the earliest models of the subject is // remarkable , but so too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The separate domestic subjects ' of the nineteenth century - cookery , laundrywork , housewifery and needlework , with the later addition of infant care - have been replaced by the four major aspects ' , as they are called : Family , Food , Home , Textiles . But until the mid seventies the fact that the domestic subjects were linked because they were aspects of women 's domestic labour did not have to be concealed . There was no claim that dressmaking , say , was in some other way intrinsically similar to cleaning , cooking or washing . The National Criteria , in providing a substitute link , came up with a new definition of the subject : The essence of Home Economics is the inter-relationships which unify the study of these major aspects ' ( SEC , 1986a , p. 1 ) . As a definition , it is self-referring to the point of being circular - a quest for meaning rather than a meaningful explanation . The document which sets out the GCSE National Criteria begins with this quotation : The most appropriate definition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to be a study of the inter-relationships between the provision of food , clothing , shelter and related services , and man 's sic physical , economic , social and aesthetic needs in the context of the Home ' ( Institute of Home Economists ) . ( SEC , 1986a , p.1 ) There is an invisible woman in this sentence . In its emphasis on man 's ' needs and the provision of services , it slides over the question of who the service provider might be . Immediately following this definition is a qualification : The later application of this study may be in the establishment of a household or partici ration in the industries and services providing for domestic consumption , or both . emphasis added No subject could rationally claim to take as its field of study how to provide for human physical , economic , social and aesthetic needs , in total . What makes home economics possible is precisely the limiting factor of its emphasis on home . The National Criteria define family ' as any household group , and community ' as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . Seen from this perspective , home economics seems a potentially vast , abstract exercise , but a paragraph later a much more familiar profile reasserts itself : // The needs listed in the first paragraph have been distilled into four major aspects : Family , Food , Home , Textiles . The essence of Home Economics is the inter-relationships which unify the study of these major aspects . The only reason for distilling the needs ' listed into these particular aspects is a historical one : the aspects ' precisely correspond to the subject areas which pupils and parents already know about , and home economics specialists have already trained to teach . On this basis it would be unthinkable to leave out textiles , yet logically there is no particular reason why it should be given preference over building maintenance , or even electronics or pottery or vehicle maintenance . The sentence explaining the essence ' of home economics switches attention from the four aspects themselves to the reason why all four must be studied together . The National Criteria do not allow the aspects ' to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose a main ' study , but must study it in relation to the other three aspects . The essence ' of home economics turns out to be a necessary invention which substitutes for the earlier idea that family , food , home and textiles were simply the important ingredients in a woman 's life . The inter-relationships ' between the aspects ' are explained in detail in a later section ( p.3 ) headed The unifying common themes of Home Economics ' , listed as human development , health , safety , protection , efficiency , values , aesthetics , and interaction with environment . Candidates follow a syllabus which comprises both a main study of a major aspect , in which the common themes will be present ' , and a common element ' which is explained in these words : The inter-relation between all four major aspects brought about by the presence , in each of them , of the common themes , will comprise the common elemcia in any course . ' The GCSE Home Economics guide for teachers ( SEC , 1986c ) , the GCSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and recent articles by and for home economics teachers , all seek to elucidate this paragraph by example and illustration . The course guide which first accompanied the National Criteria suggested that a candidate taking Home and Family ' or Textiles and Family ' as their main study could make a project on washing machines qualify for the common element ' part of the course by using as the common themes interaction with the environment ' , efficiency ' , values ' and safety ' . The suggestion , apparently serious , for incorporating the aspect food ' is that the // removal of food stains and the position of the washing machine relative to other equipment could provide relevant links ' . Whatever the purpose or merits of this hypothetical project on washing machines , it is hard to see any reason for incorporating the aspect food ' other than satisfying the demands of the syllabus . This particular link , between food and textiles , seems to have caused problems for many syllabus compilers . One Home Economics : Food ' syllabus ( NEA , 1988 ) offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils could look at social and cultural aspects of textiles used when serving meals ' . This presumably referred to tablecloths , table napkins or possibly even oven gloves , and also represented an attempt to take account of the fact that as well as prohibiting gender bias , the GCSE National Criteria precluded cultural bias . In another example , a project on contamination of food ' suggested that pupils consider the choice and care of kitchen textiles ' . There are few possible translations of this phrase . It can only mean that fifteen- and sixteen-year-old pupils are to be put to study teatowels and dishcloths , including their care ' - or , in other words , how to wash them . The difficulties of the new GCSE syllabuses were foreseen by some home economics practitioners who tried to avert a situation in which the subject , in their view , would become virtually unteachable . The original proposals of the working party preparing the National Criteria guidelines were that pupils should continue to specialise , as they had previously been allowed to do . Candidates would then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . The working party which drew up the draft criteria was thwarted in this aim by the Secretary of State for Education at the time , Sir Keith Joseph , who turned down the draft criteria in an unprecedented move and wrote to the working party that GCSE courses should cover the four areas of the family , the home , food and textiles and the inter-relationships between them , not just one or more of these areas ' ( quoted in Christian-Carter , 1985 ) . The furore about the draft national criteria and their eventual replacement was recorded in two opposing articles published in 1985 : A brave new world ? ' by Judith Christian-Carter , and The sum of the whole ' by Jane Hoare . The case for home economics as a collection of separate specialisms was made by Christian-Carter , who claimed that it no longer mattered if pupils concentrated on one of the four specialisms because from now on the emphasis would be on process rather than content . // This led her to argue that the raison d'etre of the draft criteria was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medium for the development of a large number of learning skills ' . This amounted in fact to an argument that the actual content of home economics was hardly relevant any more . The opposing case put by Jane Hoare was that the draft proposals were simply reactionary . While Christian-Carter insisted that it was no longer desirable or practical to cover all aspects ' , Hoare asked : Why has the working party so relentlessly held to the view that the four aspects should be examined separately ? At a time when curriculum innovation and development is concerned with bridging subject barriers it seems sad that home economics should be striving to divide its own content into artificial segments based on tradition . The efforts made by each side to present their own case as progressive , and their opponents ' as reactionary , disguised the material basis of the struggle . The separate-subjects advocates were concerned for the career prospects of specialist staff such as needlework teachers who would find it difficult to teach the new combined-aspects course ( although some retraining courses were offered to them ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strict specialists , many would lose their jobs anyway . As Christian-Carter pointed out with some bitterness , the other side 's position was more politically expedient than her own . Schools were not prepared to offer the same number of separate subjects under the home economics banner as they would offer under science or technology . Home economists could not rely on the necessary support for extra staff and resources . The combined approach , which presented itself as new and progressive , had an entirely reactionary effect - as Sir Keith , notorious for his views on the cycle of deprivation ' and the inadequacy of workingclass home life and parenting , no doubt intended . The effect of the new approach was that pupils had to stay constantly aware of the domestic ' basis of the subject . There were one or two exceptions amongst the new syllabuses , particularly those which seemed intended to cater partly for the vocational needs of boys , who have traditionally opted for cookery courses with a view to a career in catering when they have taken home economics . Most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food within the home and for the family , however that unit was defined . Textiles were treated similarly , and pupils studying child // development or the family were obliged to focus considerable attention on clothing and diet . Some examination boards provided grids in their syllabus booklets to help teachers understand how the aspects , themes , elements and essence of the new subject could be assembled . Pupils studying child development who made toys , clothes , posters , games and meals could score ticks under the themes ' health , safety , efficiency , values , aesthetics and interaction with the environment , as well as under the other aspects ' home , food and textiles ( LEAG , 1988 , p. 350 ) . It became necessary for Maxine to make her stuffed cat . With home economics now so afraid of its own content , so reluctant to state clearly what pupils must learn , a larger responsibility passes to pupils themselves . A gigantic , farcical game is being played out in school and outside , as pupils collude with their teachers in constructing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are sent carrying clipboards and assignment briefs ' into supermarkets and shopping centres , into restaurants and takeaways , to compare contents and prices . Afterwards they produce detached reports discussing value for money ' , and can - sometimes - explain the purpose of their investigation . They can also , much more readily , explain why such an exercise has little bearing on real life , why they learned nothing from it and are amused at the idea of finding out for the first time through their surveys that corner shops are more expensive than supermarkets . They do not expect their findings to change their future behaviour . My Mum shops at Sainsbury 's so I would . I think you just go to wherever you go . ' When the theme is safety ' , and they are told not to let an electrical flex trail over a gas cooker , they say charitably that the lesson could be useful for someone else ' . In self-defence , they redirect the material of the course when it is so insultingly low-level - one GCSE textbook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for washing-up , cleaning the floor , cleaning the toilet and bathroom ' ( Barker , Kimmings and Phillips , 1989 , p. 133 ) . My overwhelming impression of the new home economics is of bad faith . i he open-ended investigations which feature in most courses turn out not to be open at all ; they are part of the elaborate construction which has been built around the old content , which is still there , still - as it has to be - culturally constrained , and still not open to negotiation . The following example is an attempt by one head of a home // economics department , who was also an examiner , to devise work for Child Development courses which can fulfil the ' common element ' requirement at the same time as meeting the needs of the GCSE criteria in general . All GCSE examinations and syllabuses are now obliged to ' differentiate ' to allow for an assessment of the achievements of pupils of different ability levels . June Scarbrough 's proposed assignment brief aimed to do this , and it also referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Criteria . This sample assignment began with a question for pupils to answer : ' What methods do parents use to physically carry their young ? ' ( Scarbrough , 1987 ) . The author was able to explain easily enough how ' Textiles ' could form part of the ' common element ' : ' materials/fabrics used e.g. slings , shawls , etc . ' . The link with ' family ' was suggested vaguely as - ' family patterns , organization , effects of culture , etc . ' The link with food appeared quite extraordinarily as needs of nursing mothers , e.g. prams versus baby carriers , etc . ' As the focus was on the needs of the mother rather than those of the infant , for ' food ' to be included at all the author was forced to classify nursing mothers themselves as food . What pupils were supposed to establish about the needs of nursing mothers , as opposed to non-nursing mothers or anyone else , when using prams or baby-carriers can be understood only in relation to the author 's assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying a baby around permanently attached in a carrier , even though in contemporary Britain such a connection is largely a matter of fashion and ideology . Particular groups of middle-class mothers have been portrayed in recent years as both more inclined to breastfeed and more inclined to use baby slings . This is by no means a necessary connection . Babies in slings and carriers also appear in somewhat idealised images of motherhood in less-developed countries , as illustrated in one Nuffield Home Economics course book ( 1985a , p.11 ) ; the mothers portrayed in such ' natural ' roles would be assumed to breastfeed their infants . These connections are completely extraneous to the question , yet without them it is hard to see how pupils could find anything sensible to say for this section of their assignment . The next stage of the assignment required pupils to survey a sample of from two to four parents to discover how they carried their infants , and then to ask questions about the cost , method of purchase , method of cleaning and storage of the carrier . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to excel : Evaluate the emotional satisfaction infants experience when they are in constant body contact with their parent ' emphasis added . Substituting the gender-free parent ' for mother ' here satisfies the requirements of the National Criteria , but at the cost of making the question nonsensical . It can not sensibly refer to an infant 's constant body contact ' with a parent ' , regardless of gender , rather than with its mother . But this incongruous literal compliance with the criteria is not the only problem with this assignment for the hapless pupil visiting the baby clinic or following a baby and its parent around collecting data . Evaluating the emotional satisfaction infants experience ' is no easy task for mature adults , parents or paediatricians . The discovery Scarbrough presumably intended pupils to make is that , as some books claim , infants carried around all the time by their parents ' cry less than babies in prams ( an assertion to be found in some home economics textbooks : see Nuffield Home Economics , 1985a , p. 11 ) . Only those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who conformed to this expected pattern of behaviour , and able to understand what the author had in mind , could have made sense of this assignment . Others would have faced an utterly bewildering task : their best strategy would probably have been to copy out extracts from the literature which claims that elsewhere in the world there are babies who are kept constantly with their mothers , and are never known to cry . Other parts of the assignment told pupils to relate the results of their survey to the family , home , food and textiles , and to explain the links between family , home , food and textiles ' . In this way the assignment could fulfil the first of the Aims ' of home economics given in the National Criteria : To develop pupils ' awareness of the inter-relationships within Home Economics ' ( SEC , 1986a , p.2 ) . Explaining the requirements of the syllabus in itself becomes one of the tasks pupils face when they study GCSE Home Economics . As pupils are unlikely to discover for themselves that textiles ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study of ways of carrying infants , the best way of equipping them to cope with this aim would probably be to give them the list of common themes ' to memorise . Rote-learning would offer them the surest path through this maze of spuriously progressive education . The fundamental dishonesty which now underlies home economics // goes well beyond the contrast between its elaborate structures and its ac-tual content , which results in the study of providing for human physical , economic , social and aesthetic needs ' coming down to earth as a study of dishcloths ? like changing ends of a telescope . It goes beyond the careful exclusion of gender from contexts where it would appear to have a legitimate place . The integrity of home economics teaching is under-mined most of all by the emphasis on open-ended ' questions and assignments , which in fact conceal implicit assumptions . The switch from content to process , from telling pupils how to live to inviting them to explore ways of living , is based on a message purportedly free of bias which is ultimately a false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pupils know , of course , that there are still right answers , and that home economics teachers and examiners know these right answers in advance . Sometimes an awareness of this double-think threatens to break through the neutered , flattened surfaces of home economics texts . The chapter on design ' in a Nuffield Home Economics course book includes a photograph of a three-piece suite ( 1985a , p. 123 ) . The accompanying teacher 's book explains the point of this photograph and another one alongside it : These photographs show examples of what is generally recognised to be good and bad design . You could discuss these pictures with your pupils . What is it that makes the Darlington jars in figure 15.1 so pleasing ? Why is the Italian three-piece suite in figure 15.5 so awful ? Do any pupils like it ? Such responses are mainly subjective , and it should not be considered wrong ' to like it . ( 1985b , p. 169 ) It is this extract 's blatant dishonesty that makes it so awful , although it is only a **26;1750;TOOLONG version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The authors make a revealing distinction between the pupils ' mainly subjective ' responses and their own , in collusion with the teacher , which are presumed to be objective . While they make it clear that it would really be wrong to like the awful suite , they also explain that it would be better not to let the pupils know this directly . The concepts generally recognised ' , good ' , bad ' , awful ' , and ' pleasing ' are used casually , without a context , as if they explain themselves and are not bound to historical periods and such awkward categories as class and cultural grouping . The passage incites teachers to a deliberate deception , which if it worked would end up as a tortuous // way of telling pupils what teachers think is good design . Such attempts at concealment in the cause of open , discovery ' learning depend on pupils ' skills in working out what teacher really has in mind . It is usually not difficult for pupils to work out the right answers , even when they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state what they really think . Another textbook from a popular series reprinted in 1985 - a book Wynn ( 1983 ) singled out for praise for its non-sexist approach - had this to say about childcare : Until quite recently it was accepted as normal that nearly all mothers who had children should stay at home to look after them . As long as the mother wants to do this and is able to provide a warm , affectionate and interesting family life , this is probably the best background a child can have , particularly in the first few years of his life . ( McGrath , 1980 , p. 159 ) Pupils were then asked whether , if they had two children under five and enough money , they would want to go out to work , and in what circumstances they thought mothers really ' needed help in caring for their children . The pretence of inviting discussion traps girls ( at least there is no pretence that the questions address boys too ) into declaring themselves in favour of full-time motherhood , unless they are prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traps beckon in examination papers where pupils are asked to discuss ' , say , the outcome of a court case in which the judge awarded custody to the child 's father , an accountant , rather than to its mother , who was living with a plumber ( specimen 1988 GCSE paper : SEG , 1986 ) . It is not explicitly stated that the issue is supposed to be parenting styles , although the marking scheme makes the parameters of the question clear for the examiner . Pupils who might wish to discuss the relevance of class or gender inequalities would not gain any marks : they have to bring to the question a knowledge of the values inherent in home economics , if the question is not to become simply a test of comprehension or , more dangerously , a real question . Within the framework of home economics , pupils ( including plumbers ' daughters ) are not allowed to define for themselves what questions may be asked . If topics could be treated in a genuinely open-ended way , the subject would simply explode . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all costs as a school subject , now lies in the emphasis on service . The // problem of how to set and mark a cookery paper which pupils from any background could do has been circumvented by switching the emphasis from how to cook to whom to cook for : the interrelationship of needs and services . In order to keep gender out of home economics , questions about whose needs are being serviced by whom have to be suppressed . Many specimen assignments present pupils with short summaries of a situation which places them as the provider of a service to , for example , a physically handicapped child , or a sibling . They tend to reduce people to stereotypes , asking pupils to make an item to give as a present to a handicapped child as though a child 's handicap defines the child ; asking them to plan a meal for two retired people , as if suggesting that an age group was enough for pupils to infer various other relevant facts . The end results of these assignments could be marked in a culturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pupils ' answers and mark communication skills alone . However much they at-tempt to be open , they can not ultimately evade the fact that cooking , caring for children and other domestic ' occupations are cultural ac-tivities . The neutrality they strive for is not finally possible , unless anything is allowable , but in an examination with a marking scheme it must be assumed that the examiners ' openness stops somewhere . Pupils are expected to deliver an appropriate service , without doubting that there is an appropriate service and without asking why . The National Criteria forced into syllabuses another variety of super-ficial freedom , since they prohibited not only gender bias but bias on the grounds of race , religion or culture . Years of complaints of monoculturalism in examination papers had not had much effect , but with the introduction of GCSE the examining boards finally had to clean up their act . Black pupils , especially Afro-Caribbean girls in the 1960s and 1970s , had suffered more than other groups of pupils from the educational harm of home economics . This was partly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were steered away from academic courses and into non-examination classes , which for girls would usually include domestic subjects . Their examination choices were also restricted , as one West Indian university student , quoted in an article by Yvonne Collymore ( June 1974 ) , reported : I was only allowed to take cookery , needlework and religious education as subjects at 0-level . I was told that my English was not good enough to take // English language , and because of timetable difficulties could not take science . The careers officer tried to persuade me to do catering but I went to classes to add further 0- and A- levels . The problem ' , as it was seen , of teaching immigrant pupils in home economics classes had begun to disturb the tranquillity of domestic crafts teaching a few years earlier , and at first the proposed solutions tended to focus on exotic vegetables . Pictures of these on the walls , it was suggested to cookery teachers , would make pupils feel more at home . Faced with pupils who could not eat pork or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave up and left the profession . Many more saw themselves positively as having a role in the forefront of multiculturalism , helping pupils to link the cultures of home and school . A Schools Council-linked survey in the early 1970s found that the great majority of home economics department heads were in favour of using their subject to prepare pupils for life in a multiracial society ' , although only just over half thought their current syllabuses were adapted to do this in any way . In London a group of home economics teachers set up an informal working party in 1973 , to pool multicultural resources and produce teaching aids ( Gillett , 1974 , p. 139 ) . The ATDS journal Housecraft published a series of articles by Yvonne Collymore in 1974 , offering advice on teaching home economics in multicultural schools . Collymore 's analysis was much more astute than the solutions she was able to offer , given the rigidity of the subject at the time . She referred directly to racism as the major factor underlying Caribbean pupils ' underachievement . Her discussion of immigrant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reminiscent of the objections voiced by working-class parents in Britain in the nineteenth century : ... parents have the impression that they are not being taught anything in schools . In fact , some parents have the idea that their children are taught these non-academic ' subjects deliberately to prevent them from studying English , mathematics and science ... Often , the feeling is that lessons such as home economics are designed not so much to produce better housewives and mothers but to provide more domestics for hospitals and canteens , office and factory cleaners , and cooks for cafes and restaurants . ( May 1974 , pp. 136-7 ) Collymore appeared to understand parents ' fears and the real experiences of racism and hardship which lay behind them , yet her task was to recon70 Wasting Girls ' Time cile parents to home economics teaching , defuse their anxieties and present the subject as a most important channel of communication between home and school . She cited examples of parents invited to meals at school which their daughters had cooked , mothers invited in with their babies for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital information , since bedmaking , washing up , laundry and housecleaning are carried out quite differently in tropical countries so immigrants to Britain will be unfamiliar with English practices ' . Immigrant pupils might not know about blankets , carpets or vacuum cleaners , so it was important to teach about these . The stress , in her suggestions for adapting the existing syllabus , was on how little teachers needed to change their existing practices . The basic framework of courses which pupils had to follow could remain intact , she reassured teachers , although she stressed the need to respect religious or cultural taboos . It was a question of allowing some pupils a certain individual licence , in exchange for requiring them to work through the normal elements of the curriculum : Somewhere during the course of four or five years needlework pupils should have the choice of making a garment traditional to their home culture , even if some of the items made during the course are obligatory. ( p. 103 ) Why not allow the West Indian girls to make this version macaroni-andcheese on condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion ? ( p. 66 ) It seems less likely that Collymore was setting these limits herself than that she felt it would be unrealistic to expect more . There was an oppressive irony in the approaches which saw home economics teaching as a means to mutual understanding between majority and minority cultures , in a period when it was operating as a vehicle for racism in more than one sense . While - at best - making accommodating gestures such as Yvonne Collymore proposed , it continued to send out its message about the correctness and superiority of a single mode of living : British , white , Gentile , rigidly sex-stereotyped and saturated with the values of the post-war middle class . Furthermore , this teaching was effectively forced on many Afro-Caribbean girls , whilst they and their parents were frustrated in their expectations of a high standard of general education in British schools . Changes in approaches to multicultural education were reflected // especially clearly in home economics , because of the obviously cultural basis of much of its content . A decade after Housecraft was considering ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even colour and physiology ( for example , encouraging teachers to advise West Indian girls on the most suitable choice of British fashion for their figures and skin type ) this model of multicultural education was under attack . The problem ' of multiracial schools became less amenable to solution for home economics , without a radical reshaping of the curriculum . Sue Oliver ( 1984 ) examined assessment as an area of particular concern , since existing syllabuses , examination papers and methods of assessment were quite clearly unfair to many pupils . Her analysis of the state of the subject drew attention to the culturally specific nature of the criteria for assessment , which privileged one set of methods for practical work alone as correct ' and relied on pupils ' familiarity with a fixed content which was shaped by both race and class bias . According to Oliver , teachers were often unaware how alien the subject appeared to their pupils , especially to Asian girls who made great efforts to learn seemingly arbitrary rules and concepts and prepared dishes they could not eat , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disclose this ' ( p. 23 ; original emphasis ) . The suffering , revulsion and humiliation this phrase covers have to be imagined , together with the power over girls ' lives of a school regime which forced them to keep silent . Evidence of this nature provided an eloquent argument for deeper changes , which would not only allow for cultural variation but would also remove all possible causes of cultural disadvantage . In her conclusions , Sue Oliver called for teachers to adopt an actively anti-racist stance and argued that developing cross-cultural studies in home economics could help create positive attitudes towards the expression of cultural variation ' . The problem of finding genuinely multicultural assessment criteria surely provided much of the impetus for the , change from content to process which featured so strongly in the new GCSE . The General Criteria for GCSE warned that every possible effort must be made to ensure that syllabuses and examinations are free of political , ethnic , gender and other forms of bias ' ( SEC , 1986b , p. 7 ) . This was asking a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to practise washing their // brothers ' shirts or to have a repertoire of standard ' pastry- and cake-making techniques ready to demonstrate . As with their attempts to ex-clude gender bias , there is now considerable evidence that examination boards and educational publishers , with critical encouragement from teachers , have recently been attempting to exclude bias on the grounds of race and culture . Any sample of home economics teaching materials still in use in schools would unquestionably reveal examples of continuing bias . One commentator in the late 1980s who turned up instances of racist and sex-ist bias from his inspection of a sample of home economics texts included in his advice a recommendation that pupils should stick warnings about racist or sexist content in their textbooks ( Antonouris , 1987 ) . Teachers now know that they need to watch out ; that books can not be trusted , although efforts to move away from the old , insular ethnocentricity have even made matters worse in some cases . One textbook referred to earlier ( Nuffield Home Economics , 1985a ) portrayed two Black women , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mother with a baby strapped on her back , shown in a clearly non-European , agricultural setting ( she appeared to be hoeing ) . The other was a young woman working as a nanny for a white family . The token sprinkling of Black children in the illustrations included a girl whose photograph , next to a section on children dressing up , showed her wearing a Briinnhilde-blonde wig . These images , almost the total non-white representation , can hardly have been chosen at random : they reveal the limits of the editors ' and publishers ' attempts at inclusiveness . The multicultural , anti-racist home economics project seems to me as likely to reach its goal as a desert traveller stumbling towards a mirage . Mullard ( 1985 ) has described the strategies of trying first to assimilate , then to integrate and finally to include , in a form of cultural pluralism , black kids in white schools ' , as alternative power models . All seek ultimately to protect the interests and the power of dominant white groups . What home economics seeks to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to question too closely the perspectives which it embodies , for fear of its ultimate disintegration . The favoured recent strategy has been to dump a percentage of its con-tent and embrace process as a bias-free alternative , with the implication that process can be evaluated separately from content , and can be con-sidered neutral . This myth of neutrality conceals the original essentially // Western and colonial construction of the subject , and diverts attention from potential conflict between its own values and any others . Culture can not be treated as simply another variable . It comes first ; it determines what process is ; it sets up value systems which rival the health and efficiency motifs of home economics , even if the rivalry is driven underground . Cultural bias is not to be found simply in a few unreconstructed oversights in textbooks and examinations ; it is everywhere . The new emphasis in home economics on delivering appropriate services to designated consumers is as culturally bound as the earlier emphasis on the correct way to serve a Victoria sponge . In its assumptions about families , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the community is , as well as in its concentration on the minutiae of domestic life , an entirely culturally specific portrait of the objects of its teaching lies lightly buried . References to the needs of the elderly , for instance , require pupils to deduce certain information : that old people live alone or in small households , in poverty and often in poor health , without much capacity for making autonomous decisions about their lives . The constantly implied need for special services , presented as the means for extracting more specific information and decisions from pupils , is never itself open to question . That the world just has to be a certain way for old people is seen as a fact , external to culture . In its focus on nutrition , while appearing open to an infinite variety of diets and cookery styles , all are reduced to the same common denominators as if it makes sense to apply the same criteria for improvement to all . Data from national dietary guidelines is extrapolated to make it appear that everyone is in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoiding bias pupils can work out how to reduce the fat content in samosas instead of Cornish pasties , as if their different dietary contexts are irrelevant . Rather than simply including ethnic ' foods , home economics sets out to evaluate , criticise and alter them . It allows itself to do this because the criteria are , after all , supposedly neutral : it does not see that such goals as eating less fat are themselves related to specific groups rather than to the entire world . Reducing people 's lives to common denominators and to a series of sensible choices , home economics forgets or ignores the other codes for living which already exist . Girls may no longer be compelled to cook foods they are unable to eat and would prefer not to touch , but they // are still being guided into a system of rules for decision-taking about home and family life . Their own rules may be recognised as exceptions in class , although only when they become visible . The existence of alternative , preferred and self-contained systems can not be made visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own codes would call into question the very point and purpose of the work . One day during Ramadan a home economics class started a value-formoney survey of some different branded foodstuffs . Some of the girls were fasting , and they were not made to take part in the tastecomparison test . The girls who were fasting would have known already which foods they could choose and which they could not . This knowledge is not something which can be subsumed under other information ; it made the test redundant for them . The teacher was reminded about Ramadan , but had no way of noticing the irrelevance of the lesson for some of the members of her class . It does not require a strong framework of religious rules or customs , or an easily identifiable non-British culture , for pupils to have their own system of knowledge and decision-making already in place . Pupils who know explicitly about their own codes may even find conflicts easier to manage than those whose code is implicit , like the girl from a white English family who told me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to wherever you go ' . The Asian girls Sue Oliver referred to , who had to make brown stew , simply threw the food away afterwards . It may be harder to throw away a more subtle form of cultural domination , which presents pupils with implied rules they are not going to adopt but still leaves behind the message that the way they have always done things is irrational , mindless or wrong . Teachers are often aware that pupils do not come to school devoid of skills or resources , or wanting to discard their own perspectives in favour of something new . One particularly sensitive teacher explained that home economics lessons offered the chance to value what pupils brought in with them . It is likely that many other teachers share this view in respect of some , although not usually all , of their pupils . This raises the question of why the purpose of school should become , in this instance , valuing what pupils already know rather than offering them opportunities to learn more . Should pupils in this situation feel pleased that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of their // time in school , or angry that their time is being wasted ? The clash between a committed culture and the home economics commitment to avoid bias and present itself as neutral , culture-free , is also a struggle for power between school and home . It can have different outcomes , depending on the relative power and homogeneity of pupils ' parent cultures in any one setting . George Riseborough ( 1988 ) described an extraordinary near-reversal of the situation in mainstream schools in his study of a non-Jewish home economics teacher working in a Jewish school , who had to rely on pupils ' information and knowledge and obtained the trust of parents and staff by adhering to their codes of practice rather than her own . Riseborough 's discussion was curiously limited by his own aims : he was interested in the position of teacher as worker subjected to outside forces , in showing that neutral education does not exist and that child-centred education need not necessarily be radical . His tale , he argued , by familiarising us with a very unfamiliar world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken-for-granted , non-Jewish world of Anybody ' ( p. 50 ) . I read the tale another way , since it describes to me a familiar world where the rules would not be as alien as they would be in the home economics room of a standard British school . The power which had apparently passed from teacher to pupils and parents was the power to determine what Riseborough termed recipe knowledge ' , around which the teacher 's lessons revolved . Riseborough took for granted this pattern of home economics teaching , yet the greatest change in home economics recently has been precisely the move away from recipe knowledge ' , which is so obviously cultural knowledge . The reversal he describes not only could not happen in most other schools , but as home economics is currently constructed it could hardly happen anywhere now . The process-orientated version reinstates all teachers as experts . Content could sometimes have been subject to negotiation , as in Riseborough 's case-study ; process is not . Home economics teaching for pupils over sixteen , and some **28;1778;TOOLONG , has recently fragmented into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft skills teaching and the new orientation towards service , which fitted in well with a government philosophy of returning to care in the community ' ( usually meaning by women , unpaid ) , met and meshed with the new vocationalism ' . While the titles were new , the contents of these courses supposedly designed to equip pupils , // particularly those who would otherwise add to the rising total of youth unemployment , with marketable skills were a familiar combination of domestic skills teaching coupled with the rhetoric of ' service ' . The schedule for one Certificate of Pre-Vocational Education ( CPVE ) ' services to people ' course even listed housewife , nanny and mother 's help amongst the occupational roles it was geared towards - revealing evidence of how substantially similar the aims of some course providers were to those of their nineteenth-century counterparts . Millman ( 1985 ) found that the Technical and Vocational Education Initiative ( TVEI ) was not in fact providing girls with equal opportunities , in spite of an avowed intention to do so ; girls were still concentrated within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was an extension of the domestic , caring role within the home . Skeggs ( 1988 ) noted that girls on ' caring ' - type courses were often critical of the course content , but although they expressed scorn for activities such as bathing dolls - ' that doll crap ' - they appeared to be affected by the course emphasis on secure family life , and its link with efficiency in child-rearing and home-making practices . Skeggs described such courses as virtually ' domestic apprenticeships ' , more effective in socialising girls away from the labour market than in preparing them for it . The 1988 Education Reform Act presented home economics teachers with their most serious threat to date . The national curriculum , a combination of grammar school nostalgia and hard-headedness , not surprisingly had no room for the new incarnation of home economics . NATHE , as well as many teachers , began to pin their hopes on the two fundamental craft skills within home economics finding a logical home as components of design and technology . As one former NATHE president wrote , ' There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' technology ' and perhaps it is in this area that home economics can be said to be a foundation subject ' ( Yorke , 1988 ) . After the plethora of material explaining why any study of food or textiles had to be linked to home and family , the recommendations of the National Curriculum Design and Technology Working Group ( 1988 ) are like a breath of fresh air . The inclusion of the food and textiles branches of home economics was influenced by a perceived need to make design and technology more ' girl-friendly ' - at least as much as by NATHE and their supporters , who welcomed the interim report ( NATHE , 1989 ) . Margaret Yorke , quoted above , had argued that girls // would view science and technology more positively if they were linked to human needs , and that this could be done by integrating them with home economics ( assumptions which are discussed more fully in Chapter 5 of this book ) . Girls would then feel at home in the science laboratory , and boys in the home economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-section of design and technology are considerable , and affect both pupils and teachers . There is still a danger that the implementation of this aspect of the national curriculum will lead to more girls doing more cooking and sewing , although the working party issued a clear warning against allowing pupils to narrow the focus of their work to a domestic context . The emphasis on design at least gives pupils the possibility of working with food in ways seldom allowed before within home economics , where they have frequently been expected simply to follow instructions , or to produce dishes from a restricted repertoire . The long-standing problem of status , as I argue in the next chapter , continues to absorb home economics teachers . Virtually all women , they would in all probability find that the integration of their subject with CDT , taught overwhelmingly by men who have a tendency to hold somewhat traditional views ( Grant , 1983 ; Spear , 1985 ) presents them with new status problems . A further anxiety could be the uncertain future of other areas of home economics teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The creators of GCSE Home Economics tried to deflect attention from the ideological core of their subject by concentrating on process rather than content , but the newer insistence on content appears to have called their bluff . Without the glue of gender , the claim that home economics constitutes a unified field of study may finally become impossible to sustain . The doctrine of separate spheres on which home economics ultimately rests has not disappeared , but in a rare positive sign for education it has not been enshrined in the national curriculum . It is now more apparent than ever that anything useful in home economics lies in areas which could be covered by other subjects with more depth and with more possibilities of an openly critical approach . 4 On the Margins : Status Matters One day in 1988 I had a telephone conversation with a man who told me , with great emphasis , that he was personally in charge of authorising all visits to schools , for all subjects and for any purpose whatsoever . No researcher could visit a school in his local education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted to observe home economics lessons , and immediately his manner changed ; he lost all interest in me . I was so struck by what he said next that I wrote it down : I deal with everything except home economics . I do n't know anything about that at all . Come to think of it , I do n't even know who does . ' No other incident did more to confirm for me that status was a key issue for home economics teachers . About the first thing I noticed about home economics teachers in staff rooms - where they appeared less often than other teachers anyway - was their separateness , years before I knew anything of the reasons . This chapter looks at what this separate , usually low status has meant for teachers . They seem to have been forever caught between two fears : the fear of marginalisation if they remain as they are , complete with low status and a feminine identity , and the fear of annihilation if they dare to change too much . Teachers told me bitter stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being shown less respect as teachers by some of their colleagues than they deserved . One head teacher expected home economics staff to take responsibility for her morning cup of tea ; in another school senior staff had timetabled a streamed group of less academic boys to take home economics as a joke ' . Conditions of work for home economics staff were visibly worse than for other teachers . They had less time to visit the staff room because lessons so often overran , their teaching rooms were usually housed away // from the main part of the school ( often in a separate block shared with other practical departments ) and their ancillary help was insufficient . In the lunch break they often had to shop for essential ingredients . Their complaints went right back to their years at training college , where some teachers felt they had been made to work harder than other students and allowed less free time on their timetables , besides always being singled out as different . One teacher spoke with heavy irony of her mother 's advice , which had in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cookery teacher , that 's a good job for a woman . ' Another gestured around her and said , I teach in a kitchen . ' Women in home economics have had to fight their corner for a long time . A contradictory portrait of the women involved in home economics teaching emerges from any account of the subject 's history . They were traditionalists almost by definition , especially in their views about women 's role , but in the early years they were also pioneers . Organising for a domestic feminism , they were militants at least for their own cause . Within the teaching profession they can claim more than most groups of teachers to have a history of their own , differentiated from the general profession by their distinctive status and a century of separate training . Training for teachers of domestic subjects began in the same way as domestic economy teaching in schools , developing gradually through the influence of some scattered voluntary organisations . Official recognition was slow , and funds were scarce . Yoxall ( 1913 , p.10 ) reports a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School 's first premises into the pupils ' frying pans , and the college had to use money earned from its catering operations to build itself a better home . Both the public elementary-school system itself and the mainstream network of training colleges in Britain which grew up to service it were founded on the efforts of voluntary organisations , but they at least had the resources of the Church of England or of the Nonconformist churches behind them , as well as some state support . The colleges which trained teachers of domestic subjects were set up outside this system , and remained somewhat apart from the mainstream for a hundred years . Specialist training colleges for domestic subjects teachers started out as Schools of Cookery ' , the first of which was the National Training School of Cookery ' , founded in 1873 . From 1874 onwards other Schools were opened in Leeds , Liverpool and elsewhere , until by 1894 // there were seventeen specialist training colleges ( Yoxall , 1913 ) . The Schools did not at first train teachers at all . Their earliest pupils were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The idea was that they would teach cookery to working-class women too , but the latter showed scant interest , and so eventually a different idea took hold - that teachers should be trained to spread the work of the Schools further . The training colleges were set up for women , although a sea-cook was sent to the National for training as a teacher before setting up classes in cookery at the Sailors ' Home , London Docks . Other Nautical Schools of Cookery for boys wanting to be sea-cooks were opened in Liverpool and a few more seaport towns . The Education Department began to recognise the work of the training schools from 1893 , when it issued its own regulations for them ( Dent , 1977 , p. 40 ) , but did not offer the normal teacher-training grant , but only the much smaller grant for technical courses . This injustice was not rectified until 1906 ; before then , several Schools of Cookery had been forced by shortage of funds to give up training teachers . ' When the Schools of Cookery - which also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housewifery ' and needlework - were at last given a full teacher training grant in 1907 , conditions were attached . The Schools were inspected by the Women 's Branch of HM Inspectorate , and as a result of this enquiry 's findings were told to enrol trainee teachers separately from other students and make their instruction more efficient ( Dent , 1977 , pp. 75-6 ) . They were also required to pay more attention to general science . This was followed by an inspection , in 1912 and 1913 , of the fourteen recognised Schools . The Inspectors called for a thorough overhaul of the Schools ' work , not because it was considered bad but because it was so different from the training in the general colleges . Among the Inspectors ' criticisms were that the " Special " subjects were not correlated with the general science ' and that the subject matter taught had little relevance to the homes from which Elementary school children came ' . From 1915 , instead of taking separate Special subjects ' courses , all students recognised for grant had to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs taken in domestic science colleges among the illustrations in Cassell 's Household Guide , a six-volume manual for middle-class women which was published in 1911 . The // women in them were mostly teachers or students at the National Society 's Training College or at the Northfield School of Domestic Science , which was in the north London district of Stamford Hill . They are shown demonstrating various operations in cookery and laundrywork , which if they were included in the courses for teachers in training would certainly have substantiated the Inspectors ' criticisms about the irrelevance for elementary-school children of much of the work . In the long dresses of the time , and usually wearing the neat white caps and full aprons which were recommended for respectable servants , women from domestic economy training colleges stand dishing up quails on toast , glazing galantine of fowl or arranging prawns and shrimps in the chopped aspic border of a mayonnaise of turbot . Four photographs show a teacher or student demonstrating different folds for serviettes . Captions under the laundrywork photographs speak of the earnest delight to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years to arouse enthusiasm for the dolly-tub , but once the conquest is made it holds good for a lifetime ' ; The double process of sprinkling and folding is an art in itself . ' The largest photograph shows The Mending Class in the National Society 's Training College for Teachers of Domestic Economy ' . Twelve women in caps and aprons sit round tables bent over their work , while a teacher hovers nearby . At first the two-year courses the domestic economy colleges offered were fairly comparable with the two-year course which used to be standard in general colleges . Domestic economy formed an element of the curriculum in the general colleges which trained women as elementaryschool teachers , and its inclusion was arguably a factor in deterring middle-class women from entering the profession ( Widdowson , 1980 , pp. 47-8 ) . It featured partly because women were thought to need some training in order to manage their own domestic lives whilst employed as schoolmistresses ( the publication by the Education Union of a domestic manual , How a schoolmistress may live upon seventy pounds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers needed to learn thrifty management on their low incomes ) and partly because women in elementary schools were expected to teach a modicum of domestic subjects anyway . A third reason was that the work required of student teachers helped to keep down the domestic costs of the colleges themselves . The fact that non-specialist teachers were expected to teach // needlework , as it was included in their general training , prevented the specialist colleges from gaining recognition for the needlework certificates they awarded . Ailsa Yoxall argued that needlework teaching was in an unsatisfactory state because of this : ... the Board of Education does not require the services of specially-qualified teachers for this subject , as it is included in the regular training for certificated women-teachers in Training Colleges , where it is not feasible to allow sufficient time for it . ( Yoxall , 1913 , p. 20 ) While some graduate teachers were also being trained in colleges and university departments for secondary-school teaching in particular , and to a much smaller extent for elementary ( later primary ) teaching , domestic subjects teaching remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher training was reorganised in the 1970s . Various accounts of the history of teacher training for domestic subjects ( Yoxall , 1913 ; Weddell , 1955 ; Dent , 1977 ) refer to the shortage of students , as an almost constant theme . The domestic colleges never appear to have had the same attraction as the general colleges , which offered the main route into higher education for many women whether or not they actually wished to teach . The marriage bar which operated between the wars may also have proved a greater deterrent to women holding a more traditional and less academic outlook , as well as driving women out of their jobs . The ban on married women teachers was ended in 1944 - as David describes ( 1980 , p. 161 ) , it was seen by its critics as the height of irony ' for women with children to be excluded from teaching , and the irony was of course more acute when the very subjects they taught were concerned with domestic work and the care of children . The separate existence of the training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different , but after reorganisation students still faced the realisation that they were not taken as seriously as others , or offered equal treatment . As late as the 1980s a former home economics student complained that she had been teased ' at college by fellow students asking her to wash their shirts . As well as their own colleges , teachers of domestic subjects had their own union within a union . The Association of Teachers of Domestic Science ( ATDS ) was formed in 1896 , originally attached to the National // Union of Women Workers and latterly to the NUT . Between 1909 and 1962 its initials stood for Association of Teachers of Domestic Subjects ' ; in 1962 subjects ' was changed back to science ' , until 1983 when it changed its name to the National Association of Teachers of Home Economics ( NATHE ) . The Association campaigned against the low status of domestic subjects in a variety of ways : trying to gain more space for them in secondary schools , persuade the universities to take them seriously , and generally to improve their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alice Ravenhill and Catherine Schiff published a collection of essays entitled Household administration : its place in the higher education of women . The contributing authors set out to establish a case for teaching domestic science as an academic subject at university level . Wenona Hoskyns-Abrahall , for example , in a chapter on The place of biology in the equipment of women ' , argued that if housewives were taught bacteriology they would be able to ensure cleaner and more hygienic homes - hardly the argument to win support from other lobbyists for women 's entrance to higher education . In their preface , Ravenhill and Schiff widened the argument : ... blind instinct must yield place to trained intelligence if home life is to be preserved and modern conditions of existence adequately adjusted to human requirements ... In order that desirable saving in time , money , labour , health or happiness shall be effected , graduate women of high attainments are urgently needed for the work . It is they only who can bring to bear upon the problems of childhood and adolescence , of food , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupation , of rest and recreation , the patient study and research in the interests of humanity , which men of similar standing have lavished upon the advancement of commerce and industrial processes . It is by their skilled labour in the almost untrodden field of domestic science that the millions of homes will benefit which are committed to the charge of women who possess neither time , opportunity , nor ability to carry out these indispensable investigations ... The vision of a vanguard of graduates in domestic science conducting research into improved methods of household management was partially fulfilled when King 's College for Women in London initiated a course in Household Science ' . Sheffield University recognised domestic science as a university subject in 1911 , to the extent of allowing students to take the science part of their course at the University and the domestic part // at the Sheffield Training College . Battersea Polytechnic offered a diploma in science as applied to housecraft from the 1890s , and at the University College of Wales short non-teaching courses in the theory and practice of domestic science were arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially the same , but home economists have never managed to achieve the academic standing for their subject which they would wish it to have . At degree and postgraduate level , home economics still barely has a toehold in the universities and is taught by few of the polytechnics and institutes of higher education . Despite the supposed equivalence between polytechnic and university degrees , the lack of university teaching of their subject is certainly seen as undermining by home economics practitioners . A revealing article by Brenda Pratt ( 1986 ) on research in home economics referred to anxieties about academic status . She suggested that home economics researchers tend not to be involved in pushing back frontiers of knowledge at all , leaving it to other professions to bring about changes in thinking . According to Pratt , home economics already had two of the three elements of academic respectability , a research journal and a research conference . The third element , a standard undergraduate textbook , does not exist . ' The academic respectability ' of home economics , about which Pratt was so explicitly concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real problem within the subject , namely the apparent response of the subject to external criticism rather than through internal ' debate of critical issues ' . The example she gave was the connection between home economics and nutrition : The present criticism from outside the subject of the emphasis within school courses on traditional cookery skills would not have occurred if the issue of the relationship between cooking and diet had been raised and resolved within the home economics community as a whole . This amounted to an extraordinary confession that the home economics community did not especially think about cookery in terms of diet and health until outsiders - in this case health education personnel - pointed out the connection to them . Pratt 's main concern appeared to be that this did their own practitioners , teachers and researchers no good at all , in terms of academic respectability . Such work ought to have been done by home economics researchers , she argued , although her only explanaOn // Lion of why they had avoided it was that for some students the only purpose of undertaking research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in raising the question of why home economics follows rather than leads , it is virtually answered : the article speaks of a lack of self-confidence from beginning to end , of a subject which still does not feel its status secure enough to begin taking risks . The marked absence of home economics from the universities for so long is a story of continuing failure for its supporters , for they certainly tried hard to persuade the academic establishment to their cause . The AIDS archive includes correspondence from a campaign in the late 1950s and early 1960s , aimed at increasing the number of relevant courses in higher education . In 1959 the ATDS Secretary , Angela Crawley , submitted a memorandum to each university which had one domestic science training college , or more , in its area . The ATDS begged to submit to the universities its opinion that the time was now propitious for the institution of additional degree courses , and asked them to consider setting up degree courses in domestic science . The memorandum referred to a growing awareness amongst domestic scientists that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied the different aspects of their work at university level . These overtures were brushed off with varying degrees of courtesy . Bristol University pointed out one relevant course which it already offered . Most replies were merely formal acknowledgements , but others reeked of male scorn . The most superficially sympathetic reply was also the most derisive , the university registrar concerned writing that he thought it a good idea and the matter would be placed on the agenda , but he knew what would be said by the various departmental heads , who were quite clear that science ' meant physics and engineering . This correspondence bears witness to more than a failed attempt by a subject seen as trivial to gain respect from the academic establishment . I also read it as painful proof of the relative powerlessness of a women 's organisation compared with the might of the men who planned and controlled the higher levels of learning . The ATDS continued its efforts to increase the number of courses available in higher education when in 1961 it issued a memorandum of evidence to the Committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document reflected a view of the status quo , in terms of girls ' educational and career aspirations and the role of women in the // home and in society , as unproblematic and unlikely to change . It noted that fewer girls than boys were interested in non-vocational higher education while they tended to have an earlier preoccupation and interest in marriage , and presented this as an argument for making more domestic science courses at the post-secondary level available . The memorandum stated that there were only two universities currently offering degree courses or opportunities for research in any aspect of domestic science , and pleaded for the granting of a first degree course in domestic science as such . It expressed concern that social science courses , then an expanding area , were not set up in co-operation with domestic science courses . The document is most reminiscent of John Newsom 's anti-feminist polemic The Education of Girls ( 1948 ) in its paragraph on the needs ' of girls studying other courses at universities or colleges other than domestic science colleges , whom it claimed should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency as homemakers , and enable them to make a more valuable contribution to society . Sixth form colleges and A levels ought to be replanned in this respect . These proposals , which would have delighted Newsom , would have moved the feminists who strove to gain entry for women into higher education to despairing protest . The document exemplifies the paradox of domestic feminism ' : in making apparently progressive points about domestic science as a core subject in liberal higher education , and about the need for university-level scientific and technological research in their field , the authors were also promoting the most oppressively traditional ideas about gender roles and restating the old theme , elaborated by Ravenhill and Schiff , that women in higher education should study ways of becoming better housewives . The credibility of A level home economics was another area of struggle between the ATDS and the universities . It did not have equal status with other subjects and was often not recognised or accepted as an entry qualification for courses in higher education . In this area too the Association made repeated efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a survey of A level teaching in 1969 with the aim of proving its worth and importance . An ATDS leaflet published in 1976 formed part of another publicity campaign , setting out the current situation together with the recommendation that A level home economics should be an acceptable subject for entry to all establishments of higher educaOn // don and arguing that home economics was indeed academic as well as practical . Recent changes to A and A/S level home economics courses were prompted by criticisms that the syllabus was old fashioned in its approach with a tendency to be female orientated and white middle class in its ethos ' ( Boult and Gull , 1989 , p. 90 ) , which were limiting its advancement towards the general academic acceptability it has still not achieved . In schools , there were two main grounds on which home economics had to fight to try to shake off its low-grade image : over the curriculum for older , more academic and usually middle-class girls , and over the hierarchical division of subjects which so often accompanied a system of streaming pupils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of domestic education in the new girls ' secondary schools in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . The domestic economy pioneers had their feminist counterparts in the campaigners who were trying to gain access for women to higher education , and setting up secondary schools for middle-class girls which aimed to provide an academic education equivalent to that available for boys . The two movements had a little common ground ( Marion Bidder , who taught at Newnham and Girton colleges in Cambridge , collaborated with Florence Baddeley of the Gloucestershire School of Cookery and Domestic Economy in the production of one textbook for student teachers ) but the main area of conflict was over the place of domestic subjects in the secondary curriculum . The head teachers of the new girls ' schools generally tried to keep them out as far as possible , while the domestic subjects ' teachers and their supporters wanted to establish that girls of all classes and all levels of ability needed some form of teaching for the domestic duties which would surely befall them one day . There was much passion on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the criticisms of a Miss Sewell : ... I must regret that Miss Sewell repeats the popular cry that women are to be educated for the home ' by learning cookery and needlework and arithmetic enough for accounts ' . These home arts are easily acquired by those whose minds are well trained , and the place for them to be learned is home , though they may and should be encouraged at school . But can it possibly be thought that such things can compare in importance with studies to which Miss Sewell does not even allude - elementary physiology and the laws of health - and those which open the eyes to see the wonders of the material // universe ... ( Digby and Searby , 1981 , p. 226 ) Dorothea Beale was still obliged to use the defence that studying classics and mathematics would help a mother to take an interest in the work of schoolboy sons ' ; in 1888 , the year her article was published , it was scarcely possible to defend the right of even a middle-class girl 's intellectual education in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also continued the tradition of including needlework as an indispensable item in the curriculum , its acceptability as a genteel lady 's occupation compensating for its status as a domestic subject . In spite of the constraints she was under , a glimpse of the seriousness of the fight and the hostility felt by one camp for another breaks through Dorothea Beale 's carefully controlled language when she compares such things ' as the elements of domestic economy to the elements of a scientific education . There is no doubt that the domestic economy reformers , for their part , recognised and resented the contempt her words implied , and fought back . In the early years a few secondary schools did offer classes in cookery and other domestic subjects . In other schools ' , Ailsa Yoxall wrote crossly , ... where the ideal was purely intellectual , backward girls only were instructed in the domestic arts - a state of things which needs little comment ; for however much the girls as individuals might benefit by their home training , the whole principle of it was wrong and based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is necessary for a good housewife - the only career open to a dull girl . ( p. 47 ) . Yoxall also criticised girls ' secondary schools for seeing domestic subjects , apart from needlework , as outside the ordinary curriculum , and for allocating too little time to them when they were included . When the reason was not prejudice , she suggested that it was because timetables were already overcrowded with examination subjects which were wrongly regarded as essential . She pinned her hopes on hygiene , as a branch of home economics , displacing from girls ' education other unspecified subjects which , she implied , could not be as important : ... the growing sense of the national importance of hygiene in its widest meaning will overcome this difficulty in the near future , even if it necessitates the abandonment of some subjects now considered indispensable . // Emphasising hygiene was one way of securing acceptance for domestic economy teaching in the secondary schools , but the strategy most of the subject 's supporters eventually chose to adopt was to link it with science teaching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and science schemes of work ) or else to present it as a science in itself : domestic science . Women who had forged careers for themselves as pioneers of domestic education were in the forefront of the campaign to gain recognition for domestic science : Florence Baddeley ( Principal of the Gloucestershire School of Cookery ) , Alice Ravenhill , Catherine Schiff , and Catherine Buckton of the Leeds School Board , whose own books tended towards teaching hygiene ' as the most essential element of domestic science . The move towards redefining domestic economy as domestic science was international , and was particularly successful in America ( Ehrenreich and English , 1979 ) . One of its successes in Britain was the introduction of the course in household science for women at King 's College , previously mentioned . Other ventures , like the ATDS proposal of 1911 to link science teaching in girls ' schools with domestic science throughout the secondary years , met with less success . This plan , and the continuing presentation of domestic economy and latterly home economics as versions of science for girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The success of many girls ' grammar schools in keeping home economics out was still frustrating the ATDS far into the twentieth century . A report the Association commissioned showed that in the late 1960s girls in single-sex schools were less likely than girls in mixed schools to study domestic science in their first two years of secondary education . Its author found this surprising and a cause for concern : ... it could be that in girls ' schools the value of the part played by practical subjects in the natural development of the pupil is not recognised ... It is unfortunate that a subject which is of importance to all girls is often excluded from the career-based courses and this is particularly the case in girls ' grammar schools ... ( ATDS , 1967 , p. 105 ) The report concluded that all girls of all abilities should be given what it termed adequate opportunity to study domestic science . Throughout all these attempts to make some form of home economics education compulsory for women undergraduates , sixth-formers or // grammar school girls , there was strangely little evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such teaching from any quarter except the home economics community itself . Compared with the strength of the arguments about inadequate working-class homes , it seemed that there was little to say about the inadequacy of middle-class homes or of untrained graduate mothers . The case for extending the scope of home economics was not made on the basis of any such need , real or not , but was predicated on the belief that the low status of the subject derived from its association with lower-class , lower-ability pupils . The difficulty for teachers resisting the image of home economics as a subject best suited to non-academic pupils has been that at least such a labelling guaranteed them a fairly substantial captive population . Some teachers argued that attempts to make home economics more academic were made at the expense of the majority of pupils studying it , who were confronted with an increasing quantity of written work which might be beyond their capabilities , while they had less time for the practical work which was of more value to them . An anonymous correspondent to Housecraft in 1975 thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in significant numbers ( the journal had asked readers to write in with their suggestions as to why this was happening ) . Although CSE examinations had been intended for the top 60 per cent , she pointed out that teachers faced the problem of trying to teach a subject which had become increasingly academic to the bottom 60 per cent ' ( Housecraft , 1975 , p. 100 ) . After the introduction of GCSE , and amidst the outburst of articles emphasising the advanced scientific and technological aspects of home economics which should see it included in the national curriculum , Jane Dimock broke ranks to put forward an updated argument about the conflict between the search for academic status and the needs of actual pupils : For several years we have all strived ; teachers , inspectors , advisers , to achieve academic recognition for our subject ... All these contribute much to the progress of the child but these efforts have also been intended to promote Home Economics as a subject suitable for more able children . ( Dimock , 1989 , p. 111 ) She argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who might have difficulty coping with the demands of written work , // especially for GCSE , had been widely ignored , often quite deliberately ' : We all know why - not for the sake of our pupils but for the benefit of our subject . ' Her suggestion that home economics ought to return to concentrating on the product , on things pupils could enjoy making and could take home with them as tangible achievements , had a heretical air at a time when other teachers were complaining that they still had to fend off the question What are you making ? ' and explain that it was no longer relevant . Another article juxtaposed with hers , on textile studies in New South Wales , reflected the current orthodoxy in its conclusion that professionally ambitious and intellectually capable students would greatly benefit from participation ' in the subject areas of textiles and design and home science , which tended not to attract them ( Fritz , 1989 , p. 111 ) . The question Dimock raised of who benefits , who loses from the quest for status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformation for home economics if the national curriculum leads , via technology , to a reassertion of craft skills . Departments were already reticent ' , as she described it , in their attitudes towards the type of unashamedly practical vocational courses offered within TVEI . One remedy for the problem of low status , to which the home economics community has returned at intervals , is to rename itself and attempt to shed the old prejudices along with the old name . The latest renaming has already been seen as a liability . As recently as 1985 , an article by a lecturer at Queen 's College , Glasgow , complaining that the course title for a BA in home economics was deterring prospective students , appeared under the heading Time for a change of name ? ' ( Campbell , 1985 ) . Yet home economics ' was meant to improve the image of the subject , as were the names which it replaced . The image persists in catching up . The ATDS plunged itself into some controversy about new names in the early 1960s when its Secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education to convey the Association 's deep concern about the choice of name for the subjects which they taught in schools and colleges . The ATDS was worried about the confusion of different names then current . In an exchange of letters which are preserved in the ATDS archive the President , Miss M.E. Robertson , and Angela Crawley commented on a pamphlet called Teaching home economics ' produced by the principals of the domestic subjects training colleges ( as they were // then called ) . They were concerned that it managed to confuse the reader , and did their image no good , by referring to housecraft , domestic sub-jects and home economics , without explanation . The AIDS changed its own name in 1962 after nearly three years of discussion , dropping Domestic Subjects ' in favour of Domestic Science ' . The membership had argued over numerous variants before finally going back to Domestic Science ' , a name which did not satisfy everyone involved in the debate by any means . Writing from County Hall , Miss D.E . Blackmore , a member of the ATDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paramount importance but wanted Home Science ' . The intensity of members ' feelings over the issue was extraordinary given that home science ' is simply a modern version of domestic science ' , just as home economics ' is only another way of saying domestic economy ' : no changes of meaning were involved . The even-tual winner , Home Economics ' , is the name given to the subject inter-nationally , the point which proved conclusive . The Association 's 1983 name change was part of a renewed campaign of promotion for the sub-ject which involved also changing the name of its journal from Housecraft ' to the mystifying but non-stereotyped title Modus ' . The new association set out to work more closely with industry and commerce , and the new journal expanded its features section and started to give more space to science ( Higgins , 1985 ) . Changing the name of an institution , a place , a condition or a course in order to improve an image rarely has anything but a short-term effect . Even if bad memories do not linger on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to be disparaged are likely to set off once more the process of investing a name with negative associations . In twentieth-century Britain , economics ' . and science ' are not words with low-status associations . Domestic ' and home ' , on the other hand , are - when used as adjectives they imply that what they describe is amateurish , small-scale , tamed , essentially limited . They also signify female ' rather than male ' . As long as the focus of home economics is on the home and family , there is little its supporters can do to improve its image by varying its name . As long as the subject exists , they will need to continue to try . The complaint that home economics is not taken seriously enough - is belittled , marginalised , seen as low-status - is a constant theme in the // letters and editorial pages of Housecraft and its successor , Modus . The overall effect of reading the literature is of witnessing an endless struggle to assert the same virtues in the teeth of the same old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic respectability is much more than an irritation for teachers : it has affected their working conditions and career prospects . The specific grievances most often mentioned by home economics teachers as the product of their subject 's low status are lack of promotion , lack of ancillary help , lack of recognition that they possess specific teaching skills , and the expectation that they will provide the necessary domestic labour for school functions even when these have no connection with their teaching duties . They have been treated for years as tea ladies . A recent President of NATHE , Margaret Yorke , referred to the failure of home economics teachers to achieve promotion in her inaugural speech : If I may reflect back to the AGM of 1957 and quote from the report in Housecraft . Miss Robertson complained that few headships and deputy headships went to Domestic Science teachers ' . That was thirty years ago . Have times changed ? How many heads are female , let alone Home Economics trained ? ( Yorke , 1987 , p. 241 ) Not only are home economics teachers not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not given posts of responsibility and are on lower gradings , heads of domestic science departments often ranking a scale lower than heads of other departments . When home economics teachers and CDT staff are joined in a single department , it is the ( male ) CDT specialist who will usually be appointed to head it . As long ago as 1956 the ATDS put forward proposals for improved in-service training for its members to equip them for posts of greater responsibility in schools , and tried constantly to make the point that home economists were ideally suited to many senior posts because of the breadth ' of their training and experience . Home economics teachers clearly were - and are - doubly disadvantaged , as women and as teachers of a female ' low-status subject . The few men in home economics do not appear to suffer in this way at all . Their situation compares with that of men in infant and nursery teaching , where women overwhelmingly predominate and men who // enter the field are statistically very likely to achieve headships . In home economics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest status possible , which means that they are not even to be found in schools but as heads of departments in colleges and polytechnics . Until the reorganisation of teacher training following the James Report ( 1972 ) women were at least guaranteed a certain number of positions as principals of training colleges . The change which began in the mid seventies was quite marked , as one correspondent to Housecraft wrote in 1976 : ' At least six domestic science training colleges now have male principals , which until recently and for many years in the past had been very ably controlled by outstanding women . ' The current situation shows a very large , and unsurprising , discrepancy between the proportion of women to men teaching home economics in schools and the proportion in institutes of higher and further education . Virtually all home economics teachers in schools are women ( Arnot , 1984 , p. 43 ) , with no serious likelihood of much change having occurred in the last few years . In further and higher education institutions , there are one or two men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or their equivalents , from the evidence of names given in the NATHE courses guides ( 1987 , 1988 ) . When the figures for higher education departments are separated from those for further education the inequality is even more apparent , with almost as many men as women heading courses linked to home economics . There has not been an equivalent movement of women into posts usually held by men : women are not suddenly heading half the engineering or physics departments . This is surely one of the most extreme and ironic examples of legislation for sex equality working in favour of men . While science teachers can assume that they will have ancillary help - laboratory assistants to set up equipment for experiments , help with clearing up , stock control and other essential non-teaching duties - home economics teachers have often been expected to manage with a minimum of assistance , or even none . As they have repeatedly complained , they have at least as great a burden of work to fit in between lessons as have science staff . Amongst all the complaints I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it did not appear that either as individuals or in an organised way they had fought hard against it , although some mentioned it as another reason to leave the profession . // My impression was that in the past they have tended to cope either by shouldering the added burden of work and complaining only to each other , or by using female pupils as unpaid helpers . If this is so it indicates a degree of acceptance of the situation , also evident in the practice which continued for so long of acting as unofficial caterers , which relied on their willingness to co-operate . The 1967 survey of home economics teaching which resulted in a report for the Association compiled by Vincent Hutchinson had as one of its recommendations an end to the practice of using home economics teachers as tea ladies : It is accepted in many schools that the domestic science teacher should be responsible for catering for school functions , for visitors and even for the staff . The time has surely come for this policy to change : no other specialist is expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service which only on rare occasions can be educationally justified . The tremendous changes in the interpretation of the subject and in the role of the teacher merits recognition . Provision of refreshments should no longer be regarded as part of the professional duties of a domestic science teacher . ( ATDS , 1967 , p. 108 ) When I began my first teaching practice in the mid seventies I was amazed to see that home economics teachers were expected to turn up after school hours to provide tea for a function which did not even have any connection with their own department . I did not understand why they were prepared to do so . They were surprised to be asked why they accepted this situation , and it was explained to me that it was a normal part of the job and not worth making a fuss about . Clearly the continuance of this practice has for a long time depended on the co-operation of home economics teachers . The complaints made on various occasions have apparently given them an outlet for their feelings rather than provided a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any purpose . They seem to have become trapped in a circle of genderstereotyped behaviour : expected to behave as subordinates , resenting this but unable to refuse because of their subordinate status . In a way , too , the use of home economics staff as unofficial caterers at least confirms their expert ' status , and although they have often resented being seen as little more than cooks , they have also resented the different implication that no particular expertise is involved in the teaching of cookery . One correspondent to Housecraft in 1971 , for // example , complained that primary-school teachers who were not specifically trained in home economics were teaching cookery to pupils in middle schools . She argued that such a casual , unstructured approach to the subject will necessitate retraining of the pupils at the upper school stage ' , and concluded : This type of situation does little to improve the status of the subject , for which we have striven for some time . Instead it gives the impression that anyone with a degree of common sense can teach homecraft . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to see how home economics teachers , anxious to correct the impression that anyone can do their work have accepted pressure of the opposing kind which at least implied that they knew better than anyone else how to make the tea . The fate of marginalisation has been shared in some ways by men teaching the masculine craft subjects woodwork , metalwork and latterly craft , design and technology . Because of their associations with manual trades these have been seen as the province of less academic and predominantly working-class boys . The same arguments about middleclass prejudice against practical subjects have been advanced , with some justification . In a review of the history of design and technology in the school curriculum , Dodd ( 1978 ) argued that the desire for higher status had been a constant theme for teachers , and that issues of status and respectability lay concealed in the discussion about titles for heavy craft subjects . ( The Design and Technology Working Group referred to this obliquely in its interim report , explaining the decision to use the phrase design and technology ' and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working conditions and promotion prospects , women teaching home economics may not have fared particularly worse than men teaching CDT , with the exception that they were less likely to head joint practical-subjects departments . In other ways which are harder to quantify the isolation of home economics teachers within the profession has had more serious effects . The teaching profession is not a unified whole . In comparing the treatment of one group of specialist teachers with others , it would be misleading to suggest that there is a norm . There is considerable evidence that women teachers in general have worse promotion prospects than men , as well as lower status . The way in which home economics // teachers are seen by their colleagues must also depend partly on gender ; being seen as apart from or excluded by male colleagues has one meaning , while separation from and exclusion by other women must have : mother . Men approve of home economics more than women do , as teachers told me in the conversations I described in the first chapter . This hardly means that men place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home economics with exactly the same respect as other teachers . It suggests more that they have been able to approve of the aims of home economics teaching , without the concern for its implications which many women feel . Many women teachers , but few men , have had to study some form of home economics themselves . Its subject area has always taken in the practical detail of women 's , rather than men 's , domestic lives . It is impossible for women and men to share the same view of it , and hard for some women to feel in sympathy with it . In school , however unwillingly , women teaching home economics have represented a version of femininity at odds with the reality of life for women who have chosen to teach other subjects . The lack of support from other women of which teachers complained has been part of their experience within the teaching profession , not simply a recent development since feminist criticism of home economics resurfaced . As products of a specific history , home economics teachers can be pictured as on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a particular ideology , it may be more to the point to see them as inhabiting different territory altogether from other women teachers whose images and educational aims can not easily coexist with their own . S Gateways to Understanding : Home Science and Technology The great traditional metaphors for education , of doors , light , and keys , can be composed together to form a whole . Going through a gateway from a narrow place into an open space , from darkness and confinement towards light and understanding , expresses in physical terms the student 's journey of the mind . Years ago , walking around the city of Oxford for the first time , I looked at the walls and gates of the men 's colleges which were then closed to women and remembered Hardy 's Jude the Obscure . Thomas Hardy wrote about class exclusion but could imagine educated women only as unnatural , lacking femininity and , worse , humanity . He described Jude 's exclusion from knowledge as engendering not only anger but a bitter sense of inferiority , but could not see the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girls have been given their own separate gateways to learning , as a substitute form of education and a distraction from the fact of the barriers across other entrances . This chapter is about the offering made to girls of a study of home and family as their means to scientific understanding and technical knowledge , and the offering of a limited study of science as their means to a better performance within their homes . Girls have been told that a domestic version of science , and an economics rooted in the home , have a special relevance for them besides being the ones in which they are naturally most interested . It has been pointed out that the laws of science operate within the home as well as outside it ; why then should women not learn just a useful selection of scientific laws they can apply or , conversely , study the world from their kitchens ? The invention of domestic science in the late nineteenth century coincided with an uprising of middle-class women seeking access to education . These events , of course , were connected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved secondary education for girls and higher education for women , particularly to the extension of mathematical and scientific education to girls ( Dyhouse , 1981 ) . Giris studying science and mathematics beyond the most elementary levels were ridiculed at best , and threatened with the loss of their fertility at worst - neither their brains nor their ovaries were supposed to have been designed to cope with such intellectual labour . Domestic science was a subject which suited this climate of opinion , deflecting the demand for access to scientific education while still affirming the home as a woman 's place . It is tempting to see a conspiracy , but the inherent problems of definition , teacher training and curriculum organisation which led to its failure to become an established mainstream subject also meant that there was uncertain support for it from the start . Writing of the early years of the twentieth century , Catherine Manthorpe noted that there was little evidence of a coherent movement for domestic science teaching in secondary schools despite the interest in it ( 1986 , p. 199 ) . Bringing science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there were few systematic attempts at it until the mid nineteenth century . Influenced by recent discoveries and inventions , with scientific and technical knowledge assuming greater importance in industrialised Britain , it then became something of a minor fashion . In 1857 the century 's most prolific author of domestic manuals , Robert Kemp Philp , published The Housewife s Reason My , one of a series of books aiming to make scientific information accessible to the lay reader ; it claimed to afford the housewife scientific explanations for the various duties she has to perform ' . A small proportion of the cookery books appearing in print - including , most famously , Isabella Beeton 's Housebold Management ( 1861 ) - started to provide information about human nutrition and the composition of foods , based often on Liebig 's theories . Their information could only be as accurate as the incomplete and erratic state of knowledge of the time , but accuracy was not always the point . In The Gentlewoman ( anonymous , 1864 ) a superficial impression of advanced knowledge clearly took precedence over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gentlewoman ' quizzes her servant : Q.
