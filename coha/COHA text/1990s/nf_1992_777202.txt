The Challenge // This is a book about children and those who love them . The first edition was written in the early 1970s when I was a professor of pediatrics at the University of Southern California School of Medicine . Our own children were still pre-schoolers , which made it risky to offer advice about parenting techniques . That ? s like a coach bragging in the first quarter about how he expects to win the game . Nevertheless , I had seen enough academically and professionally to have developed some firm convictions about how children should be raised and what they needed from their parents . // More than twenty years and 2 million copies of Dare to Discipline have come and gone since I first sat down to write . That passage of time has broadened my horizon and , hopefully , sharpened my vision . I ? ve worked with thousands of families and I ? ve considered the child-rearing views of many authorities and colleagues . My kids have paddled through adolescence and have established homes of their own . Thus , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock now and revisit the themes with which I first grappled so many years ago . // One might expect my views of child development and parenting to have evolved significantly within the intervening years . Such is not the case . Admittedly , the social backdrop for the original Dare to Discipline has changed dramatically , which is why this book needed to be revised and expanded . The student revolution that raged through the late sixties and early seventies has subsided . Woodstock and the Viet Nam War are distant memories , and university campuses are again quieter and less rebellious . But children haven ? t changed , nor will they ever . I ? m even more convinced now that the principles of good parenting are eternal , having originated with the Creator of families . The inspired concepts in Scripture have been handed down generation after generation and are just as valid for the twenty-first century as they were for our ancestors . Unfortunately , many of today ? s parents have never heard those time-honored ideas and have no clue about what they ? re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget a mother in that predicament who asked for my help in handling her defiant three-year-old daughter , Sandy . She realized that her tiny little girl had hopelessly beaten her in a contest of wills , and the child had become a tyrant and a dictator . On the afternoon prior to our conversation , an incident occurred which was typical of Sandy ? s way of doing business . The mother ( I ? ll call her Mrs. Nichols ) put the youngster down for a nap , but knew it was unlikely she would stay in bed . Sandy was not accustomed to doing anything she didn ? t fancy , and naptime was not on her list of fun things to do in the afternoon . // On this occasion , however , the child was more interested in antagonizing her mom than in merely having her own way . Sandy began to scream . She yelled loudly enough to upset the whole neighborhood , fraying Mrs. Nichols ? jangled nerves . Then she tearfully demanded various things , including a glass of water . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she surrendered when Sandy ? s screaming again reached a peak of intensity . As the glass of water was delivered , the mischievous child pushed it aside , refusing to drink because her mother had not brought it soon enough . Mrs. Nichols stood offering the water for a few minutes , then said she would take it back to the kitchen if Sandy did not drink by the time she counted to five . // Sandy set her jaw and waited through the count : " three . . . four . . . five ! " As Mrs. Nichols grasped the glass and walked toward the kitchen , the child screamed for the water . Sandy dangled her harassed mom back and forth like a yo-yo until she tired of the sport . // Mrs. Nichols and her little daughter are among the many casualties of an unworkable , illogical philosophy of child management which has long dominated the literature on this subject . This mother had read that a child will eventually respond to reason and forbearance , ruling out the need for firm leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s rebellion because it offered a valuable release of hostility . She attempted to implement the recommendations of the experts who suggested that she verbalize the child ? s feelings in a moment of conflict : " You want the water but you ? re angry because I brought it too late " . . . " You don ? t want me to take the water back to the kitchen " . . . " You don ? t like me because I make you take naps . " She had also been taught that conflicts between parent and child were to be perceived as misunderstandings or differences in viewpoint . // Unfortunately , Mrs. Nichols and her advisors were wrong ! She and her child were involved in no simple difference of opinion : she was being challenged , mocked , and defied by her daughter . No heart-to-heart talk would resolve this nose-to-nose confrontation , because the real issue was totally unrelated to water or the nap or other aspects of the particular circumstances . The actual meaning behind this conflict and a hundred others was simply this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way Mrs. Nichols handled these confrontations would determine the nature of their future relationship , especially during the adolescent years . // Much has been written about the dangers of harsh , oppressive , unloving discipline ; these warnings are valid and should be heeded . However , the consequences of oppressive discipline have been cited as justification for the abdication of leadership . That is foolish . There are times when a strong-willed child will clench his little fists and dare his parents to accept his challenges . He is not motivated by frustration or inner hostility , as it is often supposed . He merely wants to know where the boundaries lie and who ? s available to enforce them . // Many well-meaning specialists have waved the banner of tolerance , but offered no solution for defiance . They have stressed the importance of parental understanding of the child , and I concur . But we need to teach children that they have a few things to learn about their parents , too ! // Mrs. Nichols and all her contemporaries need to know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurs . This disciplinary activity must take place within the framework of love and affection , which is often difficult for parents who view these roles as contradictory . Dare to Discipline is addressed , in part , to this vital aspect of raising healthy , respectful , happy children . // The term " discipline " is not limited to the context of confrontation , and neither is this book . Children also need to be taught self - discipline and responsible behavior . They need assistance in learning how to handle the challenges and obligations of living . They must learn the art of self-control . They should be equipped with the personal strength needed to meet the demands imposed on them by their school , peer group , and later adult responsibilities . // There are those who believe these characteristics can not be taught  --  that the best we can do is send children down the path of least resistance , sweeping aside the hurdles during their formative years . The advocates of this laissez-faire philosophy would recommend that youngsters be allowed to fail in school if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigpens . . . or let their puppies go hungry . // I reject this notion and have accumulated considerable evidence to refute it . Children thrive best in an atmosphere of genuine love , undergirded by reasonable , consistent discipline . In a day of widespread drug usage , immorality , sexually transmitted diseases , vandalism , and violence , we must not depend on hope and luck to fashion the critical attitudes we value in our children . Permissiveness has not simply failed as an approach to child rearing . It ? s been a disaster for those who have tried it . // When properly applied , loving discipline works ! It stimulates tender affection , made possible by mutual respect between a parent and a child . It bridges the gap which otherwise separates family members who should love and trust each other . It allows the God of our ancestors to be introduced to our beloved children . It permits teachers to do the kind of job in classrooms for which they are commissioned . It encourages a child to respect other people and live as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected , there is a price tag on these benefits : they require courage , consistency , conviction , diligence , and enthusiastic effort . In short , one must dare to discipline in an environment of unmitigated love . We ? ll discuss the methods by which that can be accomplished in subsequent chapters . //
