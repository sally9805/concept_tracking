' <p> Zach Obert , 18 , was one of six people who died on Labor Day 1998 in the worst series of shootings in Aurora 's history .

No one has ever been charged with his murder . Authorities believe Martinez was the chief instigator of the rampage . <p> Referring to the ' execution-style slayings , ' Macrum said Monday that the motive or reason for the murders was never disclosed during the month-long trial this summer . A jury convicted Pogosyan of five counts of first-degree felony murder , five counts of second-degree murder , being an accessory to murder and burglary . <p> Pogosyan declined to speak at the sentencing and asked to leave the courtroom while the victims ' families aired their feelings about the tragedy . <p> However , Macrum denied the request . <p> While Pogosyan maintained the unemotional demeanor that angry family members consider an affront , Morin and other family members unleased rage and frustration . <p> ' I ca n't believe someone would do something like that and have no remorse , ' Morin said .

' <p> But Pogosyan 's tearful mother , Lilia Everett , defended her son and promised to spend her life securing his freedom . <p> ' He could never hurt anybody . He had no reason to do this , ' Everett said . ' I will not rest until justice is done . He did n't do it . ' <p> Topolnicki called on Macrum to add to punishment imposed on Pogosyan by ordering restitution . He said prisoners can earn small sums of money , usually spent on candy , snacks and sundries . <p> In Pogosyan 's case , Topolnicki said , he should be deprived even of prison earnings , as well as any book , television or film money - to serve as a reminder of the devastation he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by calling for Macrum to suspend the life sentences mandated for adults convicted of first-degree murder .
