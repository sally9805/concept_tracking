... As I was saying , ladies and gentlemen , before that little unpleasantness : I have just been assured , by those in position to know , that this evening 's eminent " mystery guest " has arrived , and should be with us any time now . <p> Did I say " arrived " ? In the literary sense and on the literary scene , our distinguished visitor " arrived , " of course , with her first collection of poems , or at latest with her prizewinning second . On the international political scene , as the whole world knows , she arrived with a vengeance  --  excuse the poor joke , not intended  --  upon the publication of that more recent , truly epical poetic satire of hers whose very title it is dangerous to mention favorably in some quarters , though thank heaven not here . At least I hope not here ; that unbecoming ruckus just now makes me wonder . And as of just a short time ago , I 'm delighted to announce , she has arrived in our city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introducing my introduction , I suppose we might say , while we await together the main event  --  the most controversial poet of our dying century ( politically controversial , it 's important to remember , not artistically controversial , for better or worse ) is in midwhisk from the airport to our campus , to honor us by inaugurating this new lecture series . In that final sense , she should arrive here in the flesh  --  the all too mortal , all too vulnerable flesh  --  within the quarter hour . <p> In that meantime , I thank again the overwhelming majority of you for your patience with this unavoidable delay . It is owing , let me repeat , neither to any dilatoriness whatever on our visitor 's part nor to transoceanic air-traffic problems , but solely to the extraordinary security measures that , alas , necessarily attend and not infrequently impede the woman 's every movement . Who could have imagined that , at this hour of the world , a mere book , a mere poem , could provoke so dreadful a stir ? <p> Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am a writer , not of verse but of fiction : one whose " controversiality , " such as it is , is fortunately of the aesthetic rather than the political variety . And I must acknowledge that although it is my professional line of work to imagine myself into other people 's situations , I can not for the life of me imagine what it must be like for such a free , proud , articulate , sensitive , gregarious , impassioned , and altogether high-spirited spirit as our impending visitor 's to endure and even to go on making art under her constricted circumstances  --  not to mention courageously putting herself in harm 's way by accepting from time to time such invitations as ours ( whose absence of advance publicity I 'm sure you appreciate , although you numbers suggest that word somehow got out despite our precautions ) . I shake my head ; I am awed , truly humbled . It was my good fortune to first meet and enjoy the company of out eminent/imminent guest some years ago , before the present storm of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were happily just representative scribblers from two different countries sharing a lecture platform in a third  --  and I heartily do not envy her present celebrity At the same time , for her sake if not for my own , I much wish that some Arabian-Nights genie could put me and every one of us who treasure artistic freedom and deplore murderous zealotry into our guest 's skin , each of us for just a single day , and she in ours , to give us the chastening , attention-focusing taste of terrorism and to give her , who must surely crave it , a bit of respite therefrom : a souvenir of the artist 's more usual condition of being blissfully ignored by the world at large . <p> But I was speaking of meantimes , was I not  --  indeed , both of meantimes and of mean times , and of introductions to introductions . For some decades , as it happens , I have belonged to that peculiarly American species , the writer in the university . Indeed , it has been my pleasure and privilege for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a full-time writer of fiction . As , again , some few of you may have heard , at the end of the current semester I 'll be retiring from that agreeable association ( my replacement has yet to be named , but I do n't mind confiding to you that we 're taking advantage of this new lecture series to look over a roster of likely candidates  --  not including tonight 's visitor , alas  --  to any one of whom I would confidently entrust the baton of my professorship ) . There is an appropriate irony , therefore , in its having devolved upon me , as perhaps my final public action is a member of our faculty , to introduce not only tonight 's extraordinary guest speaker but also this newly endowed " Last Lecture " series that her visit will so auspiciously inaugurate . <p> Valediction , benediction : I see therein no contradiction  --  and while I 'm in the **35;94;TOOLONG mode , let me pray that to my valedictory introduction there may be no further interruption .... <p> So . Well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impromptu brief digression on the subject of ... introductions . <p> The purpose of introductions , I have somewhere read , is normally threefold : first , to give late-arriving members of the audience time to be seated , as I notice a few in process of doing even now ; second , to test and if necessary adjust the public-address system for the principal speaker ; and at the same time ( third ) to give her of him a few moments to size up the house and perhaps make appropriate program modifications . Introductions , therefore , should go on for longer than one sentence  --  but not much longer . And may Apollo spare us the introducer who either in the length of his/her introduction presumes upon the speaker 's allotted time , or in its manner attempts to upstage the introducee <p> But tonight , it goes without saying , is another story . We need not ask of it the traditional Passover question  --  " How is this night different from all other nights ? "  --  although that is the question that I urge apprentice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main action of their stories . Why is it that Irma decides to terminate Fred today , rather than two weeks ago of next semester ? What was it about this satirical verse-epic of our visitor 's that provoked so astonishing and lamentable a reaction , which her scarcely less provocative earlier works did not ? You get the idea . I trust you 'll appreciate , however , that in all my years of introducing our visiting writers to their audiences , this is my maiden experience of being not so much an introducer as a warm-up act for " him who shall come after me , " as John the Baptist put it ( in this instance , her who shall etc . ) . The bona fide introduction that I had prepared  --  short , short , I assure you , and not badly turned , if I do say so myself  --  I am thus obliged to expand ad libitum like one of those talking heads on public television fund-raisers , either until there 's mutiny in the ranks ( but let it be more orderly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or else until our eagerly awaited guest ... <p> One moment , please . <p> She is ? Allah be praised for that ( No disrespect to that deity intended . ) <p> My friends : I 'm perfectly delighted to announce that the limousine of our so patiently awaited leadoff lecture-du-soir , together with its attendant security convoy , has reached the campus , and that therefore it should be a matter of mere minutes  --  another ten or fifteen tops , I estimate and profoundly hope  --  before I happily yield this podium to the Godot for whom we 've all been waiting . May that news update appease you while I now go straight to the matter of this series : <p> The anonymous benefactress who endowed " Last Lectures " ( she was , like our guest , a she ; that much I can tell you . Perhaps the muse ? ) throughout her long and prosperous lifetime was a perennial student , by her own description , and an inveterate " cultural attender , " ever present on occasions like these . In her advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some critical zest from the circumstance that , for all she knew , any given lecture or similar cultural occasion that she happened to be attending could feasibly be her last . It was her whimsical but quite serious inspiration , therefore , to endow handsomely a series of public lectures at this institution , with the stipulation that each speaker would be asked to imagine that this will be his or her valedictory presentation , her " last lecture "  --  as , for all any of us knows , any given utterance of ours might well turn out to be . Thus would we hear our visitors ' " bottom line " sentiments , their summings up ; and thus by the way would the situation of the guest approximate that of the hostess  --  who , I 'm sorry to report , went to her reward shortly after rewarding us with her philanthropy , and so can not attend , at least in the flesh , this first Last Lecture , nor any of those to follow it ( the interest on our muse 's endowment being generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Do I dare point out  --  indeed , I do so dare , for I knew this lady and her mordant wit well enough , once upon a time , to believe that she would enjoy the irony if she wee with us  --  that tonight 's circumstances have matched donor and donee even more aptly than intended , inasmuch as both are now ... forgive me ... late ? <p> Well . <p> What ? <p> Aha . Gentlemen and ladies , ladies and gentlemen : She is in the building <p> Excuse me ? Okay ; sorry there : our distinguished visitor and her security entourage are approaching the building , it seems , although for several reasons I would prefer to say that she is " in the building "  --  for are n't we all , come to that , in the process of building and of being built every moment of our active lives : a-building and a-building until the end , whereafter our building , we may hope , will survive its builder ? <p> Hum . <p> The end , I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And having so said , with those words I end , not my introduction  --  for our guest 's custody , as it were , has yet to be officially transferred from the state and municipal security people to our own , I 'm told , or to some combination of the two , or the three : a transfer now in progress elsewhere in this building even as I end , not my introduction of our visitor , whom I 've yet to begin to introduce , but my introduction to that introduction . No fitter way to do that , I hope you 'll agree , than with a few words about ... endings . <p> Endings , endings : where to begin ? I myself am not among the number of those Last Lecture whose distinguished names you 've seen on our posters and other advertisements ( all except that of this surprise inaugurator , for good and obvious reasons ) . I do n't mind declaring , however , that I could readily deliver a last lecture myself on the subject of endings . Further , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have done better than to begin with the opening exclamation of our Mystery Guest 's world-challenging verse-epic , which exclamation I shall take the liberty of Englishing thus : " An end to endings Let us rebegin " <p> As we wind up our century and our millennium  --  this is Yours Truly speaking now , not our impending visitor , and you have my word of honor that the moment she enters this auditorium I shall beak off my spiel in mid-sentence , if need be , as Scheherazade so often breaks off her nightly narratives , and go straight to the very brief business of introducing her  --  as we end our century and millennium , I was saying , it is no surprise that the " terminally malady " afflicts us . Of the End of Art we have been hearing ever since this century 's beginning , when modernism arrived on the stage of Western Civ . Picasso , Pound , Suavinsky  --  all felt themselves to be as much terminators as pioneers , and where they themselves did not , their critics often so regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well , for the artistic tradition that preceded and produced them . By mid-century we were hearing not only of the Death of the Novel  --  that magnificent old genre that was born a-dying , like all of us ; that has gone on vigorously dying ever since , and that bids to do so for some while yet  --  but likewise of the Death of Print Culture and the End of Modernism , supplanted by the electronic visual media and by so-called Postmodernism . And not long ago , believe it or not , there was an international symposium on " The End of Postmodernism "  --  just when we thought we might be beginning to understand what that term describes In other jurisdictions , we have Professor Whatsisname on the End of History , and Professor So-and-So on the End of Physics ( indeed , the End of Nature ) , and Professor **25;131;TOOLONG on the End of the Old World Order with the collapse of the Soviet Union and of international communism . <p> In short and in sum , endings , endings everywhere ; apocalypses large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good-bye to the whales ; good-bye to the mountain gorillas and the giant pandas and the rhinoceri ; good-bye even to the humble frogs , one is beginning to hear , as our deteriorating ozone layer exposes their eggs to harmful radiation . Good-bye to the oldest continuous culture on the planet : the Marsh Arabs of southern Iraq , in process of extermination by Saddam Hussein even as I speak . Good-bye to once-so-cosmopolitan Beirut and once-so-hospitable Sarajevo , as we who never had the chance to know them knew those excellent cities . The end of this , the end of that ; little wonder we grow weary of " endism , " as I have heard it called . <p> And yet , my patient-beyond-patient friends , things do end . Even this introductory introduction will end , take my word for it  --  and I wish I could add " the better the sooner , " as one might sigh at the end of splendid meals , splendid sessions of love , splendid lives , even splendid long novels : those life-absorbing , life-enriching , almost life-displacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might never end , yet savor the mote for knowing that they must . Yea , verily , I declare , things end ; our late muse/benefactress 's enviable life , our own productive lifetimes , and soon enough our biographical lives as well  --  happily or haplessly , all end . As I like to tell my students ... <p> Excuse me ? <p> Very well , and hallelujah : She is proceeding at this very moment with her security escort through the several checkpoints between our improved safe-reception area belowstairs and our final staging area , just ... offstage , excuse that wordplay  --  and will you gentlemen in the rear of the hall kindly return to your seats pronto and spare us all the indignity of once again marshaling our marshals , so to speak  --  who , as that earlier demonstration demonstrated , are standing by . I thank you in advance . I thank you . Now , please ... <p> As I was saying : I advise my student apprentices to read biographies of the great write they admire , in order to be encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended their apprenticeship  --  but I recommend they skip the final chapters of those biographies . For a writer , after all , the alternative " last-chapter " scenarios are almost equally distressing , quite apart from the critical reception of one 's works during one 's mortal span : either the end comes before one has had one 's entire say ( we recall John Keats 's fears that he might cease to be before his pen had gleaned his teeming brain )  --  What an unspeakable pity , so to speak  --  or else one goes on being and being after one 's pen has gleaned et cetera : not so much a pity as simply pathetic . Therefore , say I to my coachees : skip the endings . <p> The biographical endings , I mean : the endings of the great authors ' life-stories . To the endings of those authors ' great stories , on the other hand , I urge and enjoin apprentice writers to pay the most scrupulous and repeated attention , for at least two reasons , of which it wo n't at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share with you only the first before this endless introduction happily ends  --  its happiest imaginable ending being that it never gets there , if you follow my meaning . <p> Reason One is that it 's in a story 's Ending that its author pays ( or fails to pay ) his narrative/dramatic bills . Through Beginning and Middle the writer 's credit is good , so long as we 're entertained enough to keep turning the pages . But when the story 's action has built to its climax and started down the steep and slippery slope of denouement , every line counts , every word , and ever more so as we approach the final words . All the pistols hung on the wall in act one , as Chekhov famously puts it , must be fired in act three . Images , motives , minor characters  --  every card played must be duly picked up , the dramaturgical creditors paid off , or else we properly feel shortchanged on our investment of time and sympathy , the willing suspension of our disbelief . <p> There are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by brilliantly defaulting on them : apparent non-endings that are in fact the best of endings , anyhow the most appropriate . We might instance the alternative and therefore inconclusive endings of Dickens 's David Copperfield and John Fowles 's French Lieutenant 's Woman ; the roller-towel ending/rebeginning of James Joyce 's Finnegans Wake ; the recombinatory " replay " ending of Julio Cortazar 's Hopscotch , to name only a few examples ; likewise the more immediately contemporary phenomenon of " hypertext " fiction : those open-endedly labyrinthine computer-novels that may be entered , transited , and exited at any of many possible points and waypoints . Such non-endings , I repeat , if managed brilliantly ( and a mighty if that is ) , can be the most apt imaginable , and ipso facto the most satisfying . <p> And the reason for that , my friends ( Reason Two of two , which I , for one , never imagined or wished that I would find myself giving voice to here tonight ) , is this : that every aspect of a masterfully crafted story , from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scene , its choreography , tone of voice , and narrative procedure , its sequences of images and of actions , things said and things left unsaid , details noticed and details ignored  --  everything about it , in short , from its title to its ending , may be ( nay , will be ) a sign of its sense , until sign 2nd sense become , if not indistinguishable , anyhow inextricable . <p> Of this ground-truth , no apter demonstration can be cited , I trust you will agree , than our first Last Lecturer 's - <p> Will you please , you people there in the back ... What ? <p> What ? <p> Oh my . I say , there <p> As ... Dear me What now ? ... <p> As I ... As I was <p>
