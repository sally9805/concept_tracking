<p> It 's July , it 's hot , and just inside The Limited store on Madison Avenue are brightly colored velours and heavy cotton turtlenecks . A few paces away , there are corduroy jackets . <p> Fall and winter clothes already ? Are retailers crazy ? <p> No , they 're perfectly sane . Many women 's apparel retailers did so well selling spring and summer clothes - in the process ending a three-year slump - that instead of running desperation clearance sales , they 're getting ready for back-to-school shoppers . <p> Apparel sales began their comeback in February , and for many retailers were strong through the spring . Business trailed off in June , partly because store owners had little merchandise to clear out . People who follow the garment trade say that while there are no guarantees , the long dry spell may be over . <p> Still , they 're not exactly raving . While sales at Limited Inc. stores open at least 12 months are up 4 percent so far this year and Gap Inc. sales have risen 10 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry is still looking for the " I 've got to have it " fashion that drove the business in the past . <p> " It 's better than it was a year ago , and certainly better than it was in the fourth quarter , when it looked like the industry was committing mass suicide , " said Alan Millstein , publisher of The Fashion Network Report , a newsletter that tracks apparel industry trends . <p> " What has helped both the department stores and the specialty stores this spring is they discovered their colors . A year ago , it all looked like oatmeal porridge - there was a sea of beige and neutral colors , " he said . <p> New fabrics , especially polyesters that look and feel like silk , and lycras that make knits cling rather than sag , also have caught the shopper 's eye . <p> " A lot of the styling looks very good - simple and very wearable , " said Jane Werner , assistant chairwoman of the fashion buying and merchandising department of the Fashion Institute of Technology in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some certain body type or have a certain figure . " <p> Of course , a lot of factors that have nothing to do with clothes or styles affect business . Obviously , there 's the economy , job security , credit card balances . Consumers know they have a finite amount of spending money . <p> This spring they had more money to spend , thanks partly to bigger income tax refunds . The average tax refund was up 6 percent through May . <p> Shoppers also found their money went farther because prices that had been steadily rising for years suddenly stabilized or fell . <p> " Retailers have started to price things much more realistically . It was getting crazy , you picked up merchandise in the store and laughed and said , ' Very nice , ' and it stayed there , " Werner said . Now , " you go shopping , and say , ' Maybe I can actually think about buying this today . " <p> Plus there was the reality that clothes are wearing out . " Since they have n't bought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants , " Werner said . <p> Boredom played a part - young people who like to spend are buying more clothes because they 're not buying other things . Sales of CDs have been lackluster lately aside from Hootie &; the Blowfish , so money that might have been spent at Sam Goody , Musicland or The Wiz is going instead to The Gap and Express . <p> Still , even if people are bored and have more money , they wo n't buy if they do n't like what 's on the racks . So perhaps the biggest factor in the turnaround is that store owners and apparel manufacturers finally started learning from the mistakes they made in the early 1990s . <p> For many years , clothing designers believed they could dictate the fashion trends . They also believed people would take a Mount Everest approach - buying simply because there are new clothes are in the stores . <p> For example , in 1995 , when everything was beige , beige , beige , it was actually the second straight year that stores were stocked with bland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so why were they back ? <p> The companies are now using focus groups and consumer surveys to find out what will work . <p> " Retailers are really listening right now and making the changes that have to be made , " Werner said . " They 're thinking ' Let 's do what the customer says we need to do . " ' <p> Specialty apparel chains that cater to younger shoppers have learned that if they want to sell to teen-agers and young adults , they have to be fun as well as fashionable and affordable . Millstein cites Gap Inc. ' s Old Navy Clothing Co. , where salespeople wear headsets like the ones rock stars wear at concerts . <p> But fun is n't enough . Price still matters . " Their core jeans product , which is $ 38 in the Gap , in Old Navy it 's $ 19 , " Millstein said . <p> Clothing sales also have strengthened because fewer stores are competing for the same dollars . <p> Tom Tashjian , a retail industry analyst at Montgomery Securities Inc. in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business in the past 18 months . When the local Merry-Go-Round store closes , shoppers have to look elsewhere - like Express , Gap or a department store . <p> As they stock up for fall , retailers still are nervous . The second half of the year includes the back-to-school and Christmas seasons , the most important time of their year . And they know the successes of this spring may not carry over into the fall . <p> But there nonetheless is a feeling of relief in many stores , even among the salespeople . At an Express in Manhattan , one cashier who asked not to be identified said of the clothes , " They 're a lot better ! " <p> She looked like someone who 'd been through the wars . <p> BLOCK 2 <p> Headline : Tailoring to the Market <p> AP Graphic : Kiamzon <p> TEXT : <p> It 's tough trying to sell clothing . An apparel retailer can be on top of the business one season and come tumbling down the next . <p> Sometimes it 's consumer whim . Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some internal and some having to do with stores that find ways to outsell their rivals . <p> J.C . Penney Co . Inc. and Limited Inc. are two studies in the ups and downs of apparel retailing . <p> Penney weathered the difficult post-recession climate better than most . The company had the right clothes , at a price that very cautious and conservative shoppers liked . <p> Over the past year , Penney 's sales stalled , partly because other retailers have caught up . So far in 1996 , its sales are running about even with a year ago . <p> The lower prices that other retailers are now offering on national brands - or in the case of Limited and Gap , their own merchandise - have made everyone else 's clothes as affordable as Penney 's . And label-conscious shoppers want the cachet of a Levi 's shirt rather than a Worthington shirt from Penney . <p> Another problem Penney has is the revitalized Sears , Roebuck and Co . The " Softer Side of Sears " campaign has women buying Sears ' clothes again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home goods - merchandise lines largely unavailable in Penney stores - means it can offer customers one-stop shopping . <p> But Penney nonetheless is a leading apparel retailer . Penney is the fifth-largest U.S. retailer , with $ 20.56 billion in sales in 1995 . <p> " They have relied on the name Worthington and they have without question built that into the largest sportswear brand in the United States , " said Alan Millstein , publisher of the trade newsletter Fashion Network Report . <p> Penney is making the kinds of changes a retailer in its position needs . <p> One is to bring in more national brands . The company has seven new stores in the Baltimore-Washington area ( Penney has taken over sites from the defunct Woodward &; Lothrop chain ) , and some of the new branches will carry labels not usually findable in Penney stores , said spokesman George Kroloff . <p> Limited was down in the dumps longer than most other retailers , partly because of some bad merchandising decisions . <p> The company 's flagship Limited chain could n't figure out what market it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business to Express stores , another Limited Inc. division . Limited stores were trying to be a lower-priced AnnTaylor ( which has had troubles of its own ) . Customers were confused and many went elsewhere . <p> Now Limited and Express are clearly serving different markets , with Express targeting younger shoppers . <p> The clothes in Limited are more tailored but cheerful ; the fall lines include interesting turtlenecks and velours . The Express offerings are brighter and more interesting this year than the tired and depressing looks of a year ago , and are more appropriate for school or play . <p> Limited is one of the success stories of the spring season . Its sales from stores open at least a year were up 4 percent through June .
