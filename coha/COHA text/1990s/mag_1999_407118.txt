A comfortable back porch does n't need to shout for attention . It 's much nicer to be able to sit back and listen to a whispering breeze . // Through the lush Lowcountry landscape , a shrimp pond glistens in the distance . Soft morning light and a gentle breeze cast a spell of calm on the inviting back porch of this new home on Spring Island , South Carolina . " Architects are often tempted to do too much and make things more complicated than they need to be , " confesses architect Jim Strickland . " Sometimes a simple solution is the best solution . " Especially when the setting is more important than the style . Heeding his own advice , Jim designed a house that looks back-literally to views of the water and figuratively to the past for inspiration .

No matter if it 's hot or cold or rainy or buggy , there 's always a place to enjoy the scenery . On a gorgeous spring morning , the covered porch is hard to beat .
