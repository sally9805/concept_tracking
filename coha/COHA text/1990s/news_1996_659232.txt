<p> Like those singing sailors in the old MGM musical , young people today join cruise ships to see the world . <p> And what do they see ? They see the sea . <p> More than that , they see an awful lot of the galley , the dining room or long corridors of cabins waiting to be cleaned . Sometimes that view seems endless : 10 or more hours a day , seven days a week , interrupted now and then by a free morning or afternoon in port . <p> " OK , you do n't see the world , but you get a taste of everything , " said stewardess Anki Lektord , as the Cunard liner Royal Viking Sun cleared the breakwater in the South Pacific port of Pago Pago , bound out for Fiji . <p> The crew members got a taste of something they did n't expect a few weeks later . The Royal Viking Sun , on an around-the-world voyage expected to end in Fort Lauderdale , Fla. , on April 29 , struck a reef and began taking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The ship was towed to port in Sharm El-Sheik , Egypt . No one was injured . <p> Anki , 28 , from Vaxjo , Sweden , joined the ship six months ago . Her first job at sea entails making up 10 cabins twice a day . " Seeing different places is exciting , " she agreed , " but this is NOT something I want to do all my life . Maybe one more contract . " <p> Which is what a lot of the crew keeps telling themselves 10 , 15 years later . <p> " Old hands tell you seven years at sea and you 're hooked , " mused deck steward Mariano Zuniga from Manila , who shipped out eight years ago to save money to study architectural engineering . " I 'm 29 now , too old for such dreams . The sea is my university . " <p> " Travel is the compensation for long hours , lack of privacy in cramped quarters and intense effort and sacrifice , " observed Crew Steward Tom OpdeBeeck of Brugge , Belgium . " We try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port . " <p> OpdeBeeck is the officer in charge of morale and discipline below decks where are billeted most of the 427 crew members who attend the 780 passengers and keep the 38,000-ton ship shipshape . <p> A combination local sheriff and camp counselor , he sees to it that their quarters are kept tidy and their off-duty hours are brightened with sports , parties , dances and , wherever possible , low-cost crew outings . On this voyage he arranged scuba diving in Fiji , horseback riding on an Australian cattle ranch , and exploring the Great Barrier Reef in a chartered sailboat . <p> Thousands of young people go to sea these days as waiters , dishwashers , cabin stewards , hairdressers , deckhands , even slot machine mechanics , on the more than 250 cruise ships that ply the seven seas , including the Antarctic Ocean . They come from every nationality and every strata of society . <p> In the age of the Concorde and the jumbo jet , the siren song of the sea is as beguiling as it was when Herman Melville , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conrad , and ship surgeon Arthur Conan Doyle signed on for their first hitch . <p> " They like to see the world and they like to make money , " said Capt . Ola Harsheim , a Norwegian who went to sea at 15 for the same reasons as most of his crew left their homes in 32 different countries . " At sea is where the jobs are . " <p> Avast and ahoy , indeed it is . Growing at the rate of 10 percent a year , the $ 12.7 billion cruise market is one of the few growth industries in a sluggish global economy . For the American trade alone , 27 new ships are under construction , some of them floating resorts carrying 2,500 passengers . <p> P &; O has just put in service its new flagship , the 69,000-ton Oriana , built at a cost of $ 435 million . Carnival Cruises with nine ships carries a million passengers a year . <p> In the next five years the cruise industry is expected to add 40,000 more employees , doing jobs that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : disc jockey , casino dealer , concierge , sommelier , bridge expert ( not navigation , but duplicate and contract ) , linen keeper , masseuse , governess , golf pro . <p> Dozens of employment agencies around the globe recruit for the burgeoning cruise trade : CSCS Human Resources of Miami and Monaco , International Services in Paris , CND Cruise Services in Hamburg , Germany , Apollo Ship Chandlers in Miami , Casino Austria , which operates 90 casinos at sea , Astra Ltd. of Poland . <p> Like well-heeled passengers , experienced hands seek out luxury ships with exotic itineraries . Recruiters stress that disregarding the hours worked - and without figuring in free room and board - pay at sea is generally higher than for the same job ashore . <p> " The pay , with tips , is better than I would make in the best restaurant in Lisbon , " agreed 23-year-old dining room waiter Nilton Diaz , now on his third ship since leaving his native Portugal two years ago . " I 'm on duty 12 hours a day , seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off between contracts . It 's hard work , serving 20 people at a meal , but my main interest is satisfied : seeing the four corners of the Earth . " <p> Diaz ' secondary interest , playing soccer , is also pleasingly far-flung . " I play midfield , left side , on the ship 's team . Our last match was in Barbados against the Vistafjord . Our next victim , since we always win , will be the Crystal Symphony when we reach Sabu in the Philippines . " <p> Tips for hairdressers at sea compare with " a posh Mayfair salon , " said Michelle Kelchy from Liverpool , England , who manages the beauty parlor aboard and has worked on 40 ships in the past six years . " <p> Manfred Jaud , the 36-year-old chef de cuisine , worries that one day soon there might not be enough applicants to fill the 42 chef positions in his galley . <p> " Young people do n't want to be chefs anymore , " he says . " This is a job you live for : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . You do n't find that kind of dedication anymore . " <p> Except for oceanographer Jean-Michel Cousteau , lecturing during the cruise , Jaud may be the only one on board who actually came to see the sea . <p> " I 'm from a small village in the Austrian Alps , " he explained , while sampling with a tiny spoon every dish on the dinner menu . " When you come from the mountains , you always want the opposite . I never thought I would be 14 years at sea . " <p> His importance to the Royal Viking Sun , which maintained its rating as the world 's top cruise ship in the 1996 Berlitz Guide to Cruising , was affirmed when Capt . Harsheim delayed leaving a Caribbean port because his head chef , off sightseeing , forgot to advance his watch an hour . <p> Missing the boat can be a firing offense . Those signing aboard for the first time soon learn that Masters rules are in effect : no pets or plants in your cabin , no smoking or chewing gum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no trespassing in passenger areas except in the line of duty , when a smile is obligatory . <p> Drug possession is worse than a firing offense : The culprit is put ashore at the next port , even where the death penalty is mandatory . Drunk on duty , surliness to any authority figure , unkempt uniform and similar offenses bring a written warning . Three warnings and you 're out . <p> Several application forms warn that " long hair , beards , earrings , gaudy makeup , exaggerated sideburns and mustaches are not permitted . " <p> " It was that way when I worked for Sitmar Lines , " recalled waiter Giovanni Tortella , who is from Verona but sports a flamboyant Sicilian mustache that seems made to order for the Royal Viking Sun 's new Venezia restaurant . <p> In 16 years at sea , Tortella has been around the world six times . " I prefer ships with strict discipline , " he says . " Everything is better when everyone is sober and doing his job . So what if the passengers are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger is wrong . Paul Kaminski , from Danbury , Conn. , who manages the ship 's TV station , related the crew 's favorite happening : " An obnoxious passenger threw a steak at a waiter and cursed him out . The waiter threw it back at him . That waiter is still in the dining room . The passenger was invited not to return . " <p> " This is no longer the age of Capt . Bligh , " observed Hotel Manager Peter Einfeld from Holland , who supervises a staff of more than 350 in the catering department . " In rare passenger-crew confrontations , the crew member gets a fair hearing . Otherwise we would never have our proud record of retaining 85 percent of our staff , cruise after cruise . " <p> Life is a " lot easier than when I came to sea 20 years ago , " mused Einfeld . " All crew cabins are air-conditioned with a toilet and shower . Stewards make up all crew cabins . The crew has satellite TV , a bar with reasonable prices , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But some sign on because the crowded lifestyle and strict regimen help bury the past at sea : a busted romance , a bitter divorce , failure at school or business , a brush with the law . <p> " The ocean is deeper than most problems , " the Rev. Joseph Topping , the ship 's Catholic chaplain , counsels them . <p> The secret life below decks is so unobtrusive that one day staff Capt . Birger Vorland , on his daily inspection rounds , was asked by a little old lady on the shuffleboard court , " Does the crew live on board ? " <p> A latter-day Dante would be fascinated by their underworld : <p> Way below the waterline on Deck Two , 10 Chinese laundrymen wash , iron or dry-clean a ton of passenger and ship laundry a day . <p> " They have their own galley , " reported Lynda Ragsdale from Alton , Ill. , who edits " Skald , " the ship 's daily program . " It 's an honor for any of us to be invited to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rope deck , Richard Leney , a member of the ship 's jazz quartet , was practicing his trumpet . All about him dozens of shipmates took sun baths or plunged into the crew pool . Leney , a graduate physicist from Norwich , England , became " disenchanted with physics and drifted into the London music scene , doing one-night gigs in pubs . Then I saw this ad for a Greek ship looking for jazz musicians . That was three ships ago . " <p> In " Bogey Plaza , ' the crew lounge , Tian Jiang , a world-class pianist performing on board , was playing pingpong with a German pastry chef , thoroughly ignored by the chess players at surrounding tables . <p> Almost every night in the disco-bar , different crew members get to preside over a theme party of their own choosing . The best-attended party , although some of the top brass discreetly miss it , comes near the end of every world cruise when a crew variety show mimics the passengers : the most boring , most obnoxious , balmiest , the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parody . Magician Lee Bayless , who has entertained on cruises for the past 20 years , recalls one ship " where three ladies , all over 70 , were taken off in handcuffs for cheating at bingo . They had brought along stick-on numbers to doctor the cards . " <p> On another cruise " a lady confessed to being in cahoots with the lounge steward who was supposed to check the winning bingo cards but faked her score . They split jackpots worth over $ 1,000 . <p> " Then there was an elderly millionaire who rented both penthouses , one for his manservant , and died the second night out . His man Friday lived it up the rest of the cruise with champagne parties , daily massages and buying out the gift shop . " <p> Bayless , from Choctaw , Okla. , also has embarked on a successful writing career at sea , authoring two novels and TV scripts for such shows as " E.R. , " " Coach " and " Home Improvement . " <p> Dance instructors Alan and Dawn McCormick , from Birmingham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O liner Canberra in 1980 . This voyage their most eager pupil , reports Alan , is " a lady 92 years young who never misses a class , no matter how rough the sea . " <p> And some days the seas can be rough indeed . " The microphones and the cymbals topple over , but you keep playing , " said jazzman Leney . <p> Cruise director Paul McFarland remembers a " terribly seasick " operatic soprano who bravely began an aria but let out a high-C shriek and fled in tears when the concert grand piano jumped its " boots , " restraining clamps , and advanced menacingly across the stage . " Ladies and gentlemen , " he announced to the sparse audience , " we have just had a piano movement performed by the ship . " <p> Then there are those sun-gilded days and moonlit nights , right out of the travel folders , when all cruise ships at sea become love boats . Tim DeJarlais , the ship 's golf pro from Minneapolis , has set the date for his wedding to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . Harsheim announced his engagement to social hostess Rebecca Carlson from Las Vegas . <p> Sometimes a crew Cinderella meets her millionaire Prince Charming . " Last cruise a masseuse met and married a Hollywood producer , " Lynda Ragsdale recalls . " When we next docked at Los Angeles , she came down to see us in her convertible BMW . " <p> But romance is contractually forbidden to Dave Winter , a retired post office supervisor from Chicago , and the ship 's five other unpaid " guest hosts . " They travel free , with a generous liquor and laundry allowance , in exchange for dancing the night away with female passengers who usually outnumber males 2 to 1 . <p> Hairdresser Kelchy has attended weddings of shipmates in France , Germany and Canada " and cried at every one . " <p> " At sea you make friends for life , " she says . " So we never say , ' Goodbye . ' Just , ' See you later . " ' <p> End Advance for Sunday , April 14
