<p> Peter Katt is a life insurance agent who thinks he has invented the better mousetrap . The West Bloomfield , Michigan , resident wants to sell life insurance in a radical way : charge his customers an hourly rate for his services and then rebate to them 100% of any commission he receives from the insurance company . " Why not ? " Katt asks . Doctors , lawyers , accountants , and other professionals charge by the hour . Why not insurance agents ? <p> There is only one problem with his idea : it is illegal in Michigan . In fact , Katt could lose his license , pay a $25,000 fine , and spend three months behind bars if he engaged in the heinous crime of " rebating " his commission to his customers . <p> That is odd , particularly when one considers that Michigan 's largest employers are automakers , who use rebates as a normal , competitive business practice . Unfortunately , rebating is a dirty word in the insurance business , and Michigan is not unique . Anti-rebate laws are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if you are wondering why life insurance is such a confusing subject and why it is so difficult to compare competing policies , those anti-rebate laws play a major role . <p> To understand why that is so , it is important to understand that life insurance companies compete for business by trying to offer agents higher commissions than their competitors . Thus , it is not surprising to see insurance companies pay agents 90% ( or even 105% ) of the first year 's premium as compensation , with only piddling sums paid out in subsequent years . <p> Up to a point that makes sense . Insurers realize that life insurance is a topic that most consumers prefer to avoid . It reminds them of their own mortality . Thus , the most successful agents tend to be the ones who manage to break down the customer 's natural desire to avoid the subject , and a generous , up-front compensation scheme rewards that skill . <p> But the imposition of anti-rebate laws on that system makes no economic sense and can create some serious problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to keep the full commission . They would rather compete for a customer 's business by offering a lower price or , Mr. Hitchcock is an attorney for Public Citizen . as Katt proposes , a different type of service . Anti-rebate laws quite deliberately forbid that type of competition , in much the same way as it used to be illegal for stockbrokers to discount their commissions . <p> Second , anti-rebate laws strengthen the anti-competitive aspects of the commission system and thus create an inherent conflict of interest between the agent 's desire to maximize income and his obligations to the client . And that can cost consumers , even supposedly sophisticated consumers , plenty . <p> Katt tells with relish the story of the lawyer who bought a $500,000 policy with a first-year premium of $6,830 , which would have a cash value after twenty years of $167,145 . When Katt reviewed his client 's insurance coverage , he wanted to know whether the agent ever mentioned that the insurer sold a virtually identical policy that had a cash value of $257,790 after twenty years and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6,400 . The answer was no . <p> What explains the difference between those two policies , one of which is obviously a better deal for the consumer ? The answer is the commission structure . The former policy pays agents a 90% commission , or $6,147 , whereas the latter policy pays only a 45% commission , or $2,880 . By not telling potential customers about the latter policy , the agent is able to pocket an additional $3,267 . Anticonsumer System <p> As this anecdote makes clear , the consumer does not always come out ahead under the commission system , and the problem is compounded by the fact that consumers have difficulty comparing policies on their own . There is no consumer guide to insurance policies in the same way that there are consumer guides for new-car buyers . And most consumers do not realize how central the commission system is to how much they pay and what they receive , which is why you probably never asked your agent such questions as " How much will you earn if you sell me this policy ? " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50% commission ? " <p> Small wonder that life insurance is perceived as confusing and complicated . It is , and the anti-rebate laws help insurers and agents keep it that way . <p> What is missing from this picture seems obvious : an information broker who is not swayed by the commission figures dangled in front of his eyes by the insurance companies and who can afford to be objective because he will be paid the same amount of money whether he recommends policy A or policy B. And that is the niche that Peter Katt would like to fill if it were not illegal for him to rebate . <p> Katt figures that if he charges a client a flat hourly rate for his time ( say , $110 an hour ) , he can provide objective advice about the merits and demerits of particular policies without regard to who the insurer is or how much he will get paid . From the client 's standpoint , that is also a winning combination . The client can be comfortable that the agent has no hidden agenda and is recommending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's proposal can produce considerable savings , as first-year premiums can easily cost several thousand dollars . <p> The case for abolishing anti-rebate laws would seem to be clear-cut . After all , minimum fee schedules for lawyers and fixed commissions for stockbrokers both ended in 1975 and thus paved the way for more price and service competition , most clearly seen in the form of legal clinics and discount brokerages . So , too , in the insurance field , one could expect to see the emergence of discount agents who compete by offering rebates to consumers , while others , such as Mr. Katt , would offer a system that emphasizes personalized service and advice . <p> But if rebating and competition are such good ideas , what is stopping them ? To understand the answer , a small bit of history may be useful . <p> Anti-rebate laws arose during the zeal of the Progressive Era . In the early 1900s the New York legislature created the Armstrong Committee , which recommended a comprehensive set of proposals that resulted in the modern framework of insurance regulation . Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies emerged on the scene in the last third of the nineteenth century , and many of them went bust or otherwise failed to have enough money on hand to pay claims . <p> To remedy those problems the Armstrong Committee recommended a series of proposals designed to assure that adequate reserves were maintained , speculative investments were discouraged , and other steps were taken to assure the financial soundness of insurance companies . State legislatures , led by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners , quickly fell into line . <p> The Armstrong Committee , and state insurance regulators generally , viewed rebating as an evil to be stamped out , though for reasons having little to do with protecting the public . For a flavor of the regulatory thinking at the time , consider the remarks by a speaker at the 1904 national convention of insurance commissioners who fulminated angrily about how rebating was " moral turpitude " and " professional suicide , " comparable to " race suicide , " although fortunately ( in his view ) the " higher class " of agents were " doing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complained that criminal laws against rebating were simply not working because juries would not convict , and he recommended that enforcement be transferred to insurance commissioners , who presumably knew moral turpitude when they saw it . Shaky Rationale <p> The economics of anti-rebate laws were defended on grounds that are shaky at best , namely , that insurance companies would stop paying high commissions if agents were forced to keep the money . But the proponents never spelled out what marketing technique insurers would use in place of high commissions to encourage the sale of particular policies . Insurers were paying some commissions exceeding 100% of the first year 's premium in 1900 , and they are still doing so today . <p> Anti-rebate laws were sold to the public as a means of preventing discrimination between two identically situated policyholders in terms of the amount of money they spent on insurance . That argument simply makes no sense . An insurance premium consists of two parts : the part retained by the insurer to pay claims , overhead , and other expenses ( the " net premium " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a commission . The two figures are unrelated to each other , and giving one consumer a break on the commission does not affect the amount of insurance coverage each person is buying and will receive . <p> Suppose , for example , that two thirty-year-olds buy the same $100,000 policy , and one receives a rebate , but the other does not . The insurer holds on to the same net premium from both payments and will pay out $100,000 to the estates of both people when the time arises . The only difference will be that one customer bought a policy at a discount outlet and the other did not , which is usually not a cause for regulatory heartburn . <p> The discrimination rationale is odd since insurers routinely draw distinctions that nobody seems to mind-lower rates for nonsmokers being the most obvious-along with the less well-known practice of charging someone who buys a $500,000 policy a lower unit cost of insurance than someone who buys only a $50,000 policy , although both people pose the same actuarial risk . The number of agents who shed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break probably equals the number who would denounce the practice of selling a policy with a 90% commission and not mentioning a virtually identical policy that pays only a 45% commission . <p> That is not the only defense of anti-rebate laws being offered today . Agents will tell you that insurance companies can not survive if they have to pay out 105% of the first year 's commission and the policyholder then cancels the policy after one year to buy a new policy and get a new rebate . Therefore , they claim , we need anti-rebate laws to maintain the financial solvency of the industry . <p> Let us consider that defense closely because it makes some assumptions about the behavior of consumers and insurance companies that are dubious at best . First , it is highly doubtful that consumers will stampede their life insurance agents ' offices each year to buy a new policy from an agent offering them a rebate of , say , 5% or 10% . Consumers would not be getting something for nothing , even under Mr. Katt 's proposal to rebate 100% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate for his time . Moreover , a new life insurance policy is a commodity that becomes more expensive with each passing year  --  a fact that discourages replacing one 's policy now-and that would continue to be the case , even if rebating were legalized . Finally , the key premise of the insolvency argument is that insurance companies are too stupid to protect themselves against the practice of consumers ' replacing one policy with another . That is fairly unlikely , particularly as the replacement of one policy with another now goes on , and insurers have been nimble enough to discourage cancellation of those policies after a year or two , for example , by levying a " surrender charge " of 100% to 125% of the first year 's premium . Such practices deter consumers who are trying to build up the cash value of a policy from cancelling policies . <p> Apart from those generalized defenses of rebating , the insurance lobby also has a beef with the specific fee-for-advice system that Mr. Katt would like to offer . Under his system , they argue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice and be rejected by the insurer because they fail the physical examination . Stick with a traditional agent , who will provide you with sound advice for free , they argue . But people routinely pay professionals for their advice without achieving the desired result . For example , if one hires a lawyer to get a zoning variance , and the application is rejected , he still has to pay the lawyer . Besides , if rebating were legalized , nobody would be forced to deal with an agent who rebates , and anyone who wants the " free " advice offered by traditional agents can keep doing business that way . That ought to be a decision made by the individual , not the state . <p> Perhaps the best answer to the industry 's opposition is provided by the practical experience of what has happened ( or not happened , despite dire predictions ) in Florida and California , where rebates are legal . <p> Florida led the way , thanks to a 1986 ruling by the state supreme court that declared that anti-rebate laws violated an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . California followed suit , with repeal of the anti-rebate laws tucked away as part of Proposition 103 , which the voters adopted in November 1988 . No one has cited a single insurance company that has failed on account of rebating in those two states , nor does there appear to be a consumer revolt against the limited rebating being offered by agents in those states . Stifling Consumer Choices <p> Peter Katt has challenged Michigan 's anti-rebate laws in court on grounds that were ultimately persuasive in Florida . Although he lost the first round , the case is still pending on appeal . <p> While that suit was stalled in court , Katt tried a new tack to tell Michigan consumers about how to save money and get better advice when buying life insurance . He announced in his newsletter and newspaper interviews that he was licensed to sell life insurance in Florida , and he offered to provide clients his fee-for-advice , 100% rebate service if they traveled with him to Florida and conducted the transaction there . For some people at least , the savings they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane tickets and a hotel room . <p> That move provoked the Michigan thought police . In July 1990 , despite four prior staff assurances that what Katt was proposing was perfectly legal , Attorney General Frank Kelley and former Insurance Commissioner Herman Coleman decided that such information was dangerous for consumers to have . They warned that Katt would be charged with " solicitation " - which could lead to yanking his license-if he continued telling Michigan consumers how much money they could save in Florida . <p> As a result , Katt can tell people only that rebating is legal in Florida and that he can do business there , but he is forbidden to tell them anything else about a possible transaction that is perfectly legal in Florida . He has filed a First Amendment challenge to this censorship that is also pending . <p> It is at best ironic , when formerly repressive regimes are suddenly receptive to new ideas from abroad , that Michigan has chosen not simply to defend the anti-rebate status quo , but to try to muzzle the spread of ideas that could empower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices about an important consumer product . <p> The apathy , ignorance , and avoidance that characterize consumer attitudes toward life insurance generally have allowed anti-rebate laws to continue unchallenged , despite the competition and added choice that would inevitably follow their abolition . Discounts and charging by the hour are facts of life in most professions .
