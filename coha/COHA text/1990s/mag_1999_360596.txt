They broke up 20 years ago , victims of the apocalyptic burnout endemic to ' 70s rock bands . Now Strange Fruit is back for one fractious nostalgia trip to make a few quid and see if the flame still burns . This retro comedy , cannily written by The Commitments ' Ian La Frenais and Dick Clement , gives such fine British actors as Bill Nighy , Stephen Rea , Jimmy Nail and Bruce Robinson the chance to strut , scowl , sing some jaunty tunes ( by ' 70s survivors Mick Jones , Steve Dagger and Jeff Lynne ) and define what it means to be mates in a middle age the rockers never thought they 'd live to see . Some of the laughs are too easy , but there are lots of them ; and by its satisfying end , Still Crazy is the full , feel-good monty . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
