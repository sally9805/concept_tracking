He looks like a walking corpse , Xizor thought . Like a mummified body dead a thousand years . Amazing he is still alive , much less the most powerful man in the galaxy . He is n't even that old ; it is more as if something is slowly eating him . Xizor stood four meters away from the Emperor , watching as the man who had long ago been Senator Palpatine moved to stand in the holocam field . He imagined he could smell the decay in the Emperor 's worn body . Likely that was just some trick of the recycled air , run through dozens of filters to ensure that there was no chance of any poison gas being introduced into it . Filtered the life out of it , perhaps , giving it that dead smell . The viewer on the other end of the holo-link would see a close-up of the Emperor 's head and shoulders , of an age-ravaged face shrouded in the cowl of his dark zeyd-cloth robe . The man on the other end of the transmission , light-years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to see him . It was a measure of the Emperor 's trust that Xizor was allowed to be here while the conversation took place . The man on the other end of the transmission -- if he could still be called that -- The air swirled inside the Imperial chamber in front of the Emperor , coalesced , and blossomed into the image of a figure down on one knee . A caped humanoid biped dressed in jet black , face hidden under a full helmet and breathing mask : Darth Vader . Vader spoke : " What is thy bidding , my master ? " If Xizor could have hurled a power bolt through time and space to strike Vader dead , he would have done it without blinking . Wishful thinking : Vader was too powerful to attack directly . " There is a great disturbance in the Force , " the Emperor said . " I have felt it , " Vader said . " We have a new enemy . Luke Skywalker . " Skywalker ? That had been Vader 's name , a long time ago . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so powerful as to be worth a conversation between the Emperor and his most loathsome creation ? More importantly , why had Xizor 's agents not uncovered this before now ? Xizor 's ire was instant -- but cold . No sign of his surprise or anger would show on his imperturbable features . The Falleen did not allow their emotions to burst forth as did many of the inferior species ; no , the Falleen ancestry was not fur but scales , not mammalian but reptilian . Not wild but coolly calculating . Such was much better . Much safer . " Yes , my master , " Vader continued . " He could destroy us , " the Emperor said . Xizor 's attention was riveted upon the Emperor and the holographic image of Vader kneeling on the deck of a ship far away . Here was interesting news indeed . Something the Emperor perceived as a danger to himself ? Something the Emperor feared ? " He 's just a boy , " Vader said , " Obi-Wan can no longer help him . " Obi-Wan . That name Xizor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knights , a general . But he 'd been dead for decades , had n't he ? Apparently Xizor 's information was wrong if Obi-Wan had been helping someone who was still a boy . His agents were going to be sorry . Even as Xizor took in the distant image of Vader and the nearness of the Emperor , even as he was aware of the luxury of the Emperor 's private and protected chamber at the core of the giant pyramidal palace , he was also able to make a mental note to himself : Somebody 's head would roll for the failure to make him aware of all this . Knowledge was power ; lack of knowledge was weakness . This was something he could not permit . The Emperor continued . " The Force is strong with him . The son of Skywalker must not become a Jedi . " Son of Skywalker ? Vader 's son ! Amazing ! " If he could be turned he would become a powerful ally , " Vader said . There was something in Vader 's voice when he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Longing ? Worry ? Hope ? " Yes ... yes . He would be a great asset , " the Emperor said . " Can it be done ? " There was the briefest of pauses . " He will join us or die , Master . " Xizor felt the smile , though he did not allow it to show any more than he had allowed his anger play . Ah . Vader wanted Skywalker alive , that was what had been in his tone . Yes , he had said that the boy would join them or die , but this latter part was obviously meant only to placate the Emperor . Vader had no intention of killing Skywalker , his own son ; that was obvious to one as skilled in reading voices as was Xizor . He had not gotten to be the Dark Prince , Underlord of Black Sun , the largest criminal organization in the galaxy , merely on his formidable good looks . Xizor did n't truly understand the Force that sustained the Emperor and made him and Vader so powerful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did know that it was something the extinct Jedi had supposedly mastered . And now , apparently , this new player had tapped into it . Vader wanted Skywalker alive , had practically promised the Emperor that he would deliver him alive -- and converted . This was most interesting . Most interesting indeed . The Emperor finished his communication and turned back to face him . " Now , where were we , Prince Xizor ? " The Dark Prince smiled . He would attend to the business at hand , but he would not forget the name of Luke Skywalker.
