In Melbourne , Florida , the first sign of coming events was modest . On a lot across from the Aware Woman Center for Choice , which performs abortions , two portable toilets sprouted . They were put there by Operation Rescue , the militant pro-life organization that had bought the property in part to demonstrate near the clinic without violating a court-ordered buffer zone . Soon , locals knew , video cameras would appear  --  toted by nearly every actor in the coming passion play : pro-lifers and pro-choicers taping each other , police taping both and TV-news teams taping everybody . " There 's probably more money spent on camera equipment than anything else , " joked Melbourne police captain Gary Allgeyer . Then he turned serious : " We seem to be in the middle of it . And it 's a very uncomfortable position to be in . " <P> Starting last Friday , much of America was in the middle of it as Operation Rescue kicked off a 10-day marathon titled " Cities of Refuge . " The campaign featured speeches , rallies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Minnesota ; Cleveland , Ohio ; Philadelphia ; Dallas-Fort Worth ; San Jose , California ; Jackson , Mississippi ; and the area around Melbourne . Among its goals , explained spokeswoman Wendy Wright , is to ensure that " anyone in the continental United States ( ( is ) ) within a day 's drive of a rescue . " To pro- choicers , the implication is chilling : the transformation of abortion- clinic picketing from an activity for incensed locals and traveling zealots into a sort of vacation experience  --  one that could turn every major city into a potential Melbourne . <P> Founded by Randall Terry in 1987 , Operation Rescue sprang to prominence with a 46-day clinic blockade in 1991 that nearly paralyzed Wichita , Kansas . This year the organization has intensified its harder-edged tactics aimed at clinic employees : wanted posters of doctors , picket lines around their homes , and harassment of their children and neighbors . After one such target , physician David Gunn , was shot to death in March by a man connected with an unrelated but similar organization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit , " admits Operation Rescue 's national spokesman , Patrick Mahoney . Nonetheless , Rescue continued a Melbourne " boot camp " that tutored recruits in everything from sidewalk " counseling " to surveillance . Graduates are now aiding the Refuge campaign in their hometowns , as Terry and other leaders jet from city to city , exhorting the troops . " We must strive to build a Christian democratic republic that is founded on the Ten Commandments , " he says in a preview . " The only alternative is a pagan nation with rampant murder , rape , drug abuse , gang warfare , etcetera . " <P> Meanwhile , the opposition has been honing its defenses . The Fund for the Feminist Majority has assembled 4,000 volunteers for counterdemonstrations . In Philadelphia a local coalition says it can field 500 at once to defend local clinics . Sympathetic restaurants have offered to fuel them with free snacks . The St. Paul police force , which one lawman describes as " massively " prepared , surrounded a clinic with an 8-ft. - high chain-link fence , while the cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 40 officers .
