<p> THE VIEW FROM THE MYSTERIOUS OUTBACK <p> Editor  --  From the media reports reaching Western Australia , you folks seem very proud of yourselves for the drubbing you handed out to Bill Clinton and his Democrats . <p> I 'm afraid that we see the scenario considerably differently and we put a different spin on the Republican victories in the many contests they won . Unfortunately , America is a veritable " bull in the China shop , " and you folks so proudly hailing the new era in American politics have just removed the ring and tether from the bull and now we must sit back and watch the inevitable resulting mayhem . <p> It would n't be so worrying if America were n't so powerful , but given the size of your population , your productive capacity and your debt , the world must take an interest in what goes on over there . It 's OK if you want to mess up your society with leaders whose major inspiration comes from mythology and preachers in wash-and-wear leisure suits , but we in the unwashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can only lead to the further unraveling of the post- World War II pax Americana . <p> TIM JOHNSON <p> Perth <p> Western Australia <p> . <p> IMPLEMENT THE ' CONTRACT ' <p> Editor  --  I support the message that the voters sent to all politicians on November 8 and I support the Republican " Contract With America . " <p> Every person should demand that their legislators help achieve lower taxes , reduced entitlements , fewer regulations and term limits at all levels of government . At the federal level , our legislators must balance the budget , reduce the national debt and give the president the line-item veto . <p> For the first time in many years , we truly have an opportunity to make government less costly and intrusive while requiring it to be more responsive to the needs of individuals and businesses . Let 's not fail to capitalize upon this opportunity . Demand action from your legislators now . <p> DOUG SCHERF <p> Mill Valley <p> . <p> COLLEGE REVOLT OVER 187 <p> Editor  --  We faculty and staff members of Humboldt State University recognize that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to report any student " suspected of being undocumented " to the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) . We feel this is morally reprehensible in a country which grants in the 14th Amendment " due process of law " to all people and ensures to all persons within any state 's jurisdiction " the equal protection of the laws . " In addition , this process will divert funds and other resources and hamper our ability to effectively educate our students , and jeopardizes the opportunity for all students to a quality public education . <p> These newly enacted code amendments will undoubtedly lead to the harassment of citizens of color ( including members of the Native American community ) who do not look like Anglo-Europeans . We strongly urge members of our community to contact their legislative representatives and ask them to initiate legisla tive action to undo these newly enacted code amendments and the damaging/divisive social effects which will result from their enforcement . <p> We pledge to continue providing an education to all of our students at HSU and to stand against the discriminatory code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tone . <p> SAMUEL P.

" It is an insult to every voter  --  old , white or otherwise . <p> As for Rush Limbaugh , the undeserved recipient of Carroll 's misguided venom , I feel he ought to be awarded the Medal of Freedom ( when we again have a president ) for facilitating and encouraging the free , open and timely exchange of individual political thought by all Americans , regardless of age , sex , ethnicity or political affiliation . <p> For sheer liberal self-righteousness , it would be difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California . We 've become the keepers of sanity for the nation . Let us dwell peacefully in this Masada of Tolerance and wait for America to come down from its sugar high .

A new day has dawned in America and the Republicans are in control again ! Initial reports indicate the Christian Evangelicals turned out almost 40 percent . We can finally put to rest that silly health plan and now if we can just get rid of " Socialist Security " and all the poor people , it will truly be a bright day in America . <p> So as I send my husband off to cut down the last remaining redwoods , I can plan a busy day for myself with joy in my heart . I think I 'll load my AK-47 in my Cadillac and give them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can head over to the school to make sure there are no suspicious looking illegal kindegartners . From there I 'll head over to Urgent Care to make sure that some grape picker getting off a 16-hour shift for menial wages did n't have the nerve to get sick and need medical treatment . <p> Those illegals surely do not earn their keep after they clean our houses , mow our lawns and raise our kids . Maybe we could train them to eat garbage and we could solve the refuse problem all at the same time . Praise the Lord ! As for my gay neighbor , I set some prayer time aside to pray that he get AIDS , which he deserves . So much to do . . . but it 's all worth it , for on Sunday I can rest and attend church and receive God 's blessing for doing his work and living in his image . <p> MARIA E.

When management is ridiculous enough to provide officers of the law with weapons that are inferior to his adversary 's weapons , the rest of us had better arm ourselves with semi- automatics .

As reported in The Chronicle last month , together with German federal member of parliament Renate Renneback , Mr. Bluem called for a " ban " on Scientology in Germany and demanded that Scientologists be put under " surveillance " due to the " serious damage to the reputation of the country ( Germany ) abroad , ( caused by the Scientologists ) advertising campaign in influential American newspapers . " <p> The denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect are occurring on a daily basis . Scientologists have been fired from their jobs , prohibited from membership in political parties , blacklisted , economically boycotted , denied the right to artistic expression , threatened and sometimes physically attacked due to their religious association with Scientology . <p> The Church of Scientology International will not stand by silently and tolerate continuing discrimination by the German government against Scientology parishioners in Germany and their refusal to deal with the real and actual issue of a created anti- religious bias . <p> HEBER JENEZSCH <p> Church of Scientology <p> International
