They are perhaps the world 's best-loved instrumental group . For more than three decades , in exotic venues from the Vatican to the Great Wall of China , the Chieftains have played traditional Irish music  --  half a millennium 's worth of jigs and reels  --  on such contraptions as the tiompan , the uilleann pipes , the bodhran and the tin whistle . The only instrument they lacked was a charismatic human voice . It 's true that one band member , Kevin Conneff , was given to " singing the odd song now and again , when we let him , " as the Chieftains ' chief , Paddy Moloney , said in 1991 on their Grammy-winning album An Irish Evening . Still , these gifted sidemen knew they could use a strong lead singer . <P> So for their new album , the Chieftains called in a few : Mick Jagger , Sting , Van Morrison , Sinead O'Connor , Tom Jones , Mark Knopfler , Marianne Faithfull . The result is The Long Black Veil , which after only five weeks in release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies ) . Moloney , 56 , may not have smelled gold , or cared if he did . " Who knows how these things will go ? " he says , taking a rare breather in a 20-city U.S. tour that includes a St. Patrick 's Day concert at Manhattan 's Avery Fisher Hall . " But we had so much fun doing the set , I thought something good might come of it . " <P> The Long Black Veil is a lovely introduction to this musical Irish institution , with a cogent , eclectic choice of material and Moloney 's smart matching of song to singer . Sting leads off with the rapturous Mo Ghile Mear  --  Our Hero , a tribute to Bonnie Prince Charlie that makes the listener shiver , and sing along , with its manly melancholy . For three other star studs , Moloney provided tales of faithless women : the dirty dancer in Jones ' giddily melodramatic version of Tennessee Waltz , the vixen who leads a beau to murder in Knopfler 's The Lily of the West , the adulteress refusing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendering of the title tune . <P> For equal time , Moloney has O'Connor sing The Foggy Dew ; she represents " the young mother of Ireland " whose lover is killed in the 1916 Easter Uprising . In the lamentation Love Is Teasin ' , Faithfull 's crone contralto makes the phrase " What can not be cured , love , / Must be endured , love " sound like hard wisdom delivered from a deathbed . <P> Each session took on its own character , Moloney says , " like chapters in a book . " The Rolling Stones , who did The Rocky Road to Dublin , a roistering waltz with an impish touch of Satisfaction thrown in , showed up with their own bar . Moloney 's tight charts soon surrendered to jam-session chaos . At gig 's end , the genial mob adjourned to a pub and quaffed Guinness until 6 in the morning .
