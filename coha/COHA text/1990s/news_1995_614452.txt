<p> Two taxis stop suddenly on a one-way street in the financial district of San Francisco . Pete Sampras , the No. 2-ranked tennis player in the world , jumps out of one cab to stop traffic . Andre Agassi , ranked No. 1 , races out of the other cab and pulls a net across the intersection . <p> They 're so eager to play , they ca n't wait to get to a tennis court . So they go at it in the street with a gathering crowd watching for free . <p> OK , so it 's not the real world . But in the surreal world of television commercials , anything is possible . <p> It 's a world where we all want to be like Mike , especially now that he 's found the meaning of life , and where Bo knows how to play every sport , he just does n't know diddley . Where Larry Bird can make the basketball shots we all dream about ( from the roof of the John Hancock Tower , off the expressway , over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the wall . . . nothing but net . ) <p> Where Ken Griffey Jr . can run down a fly ball from the outfield at Yankee Stadium to the Santa Monica Pier , then throw out a runner all the way from California as Phil Rizzuto shouts in his best Bronx accent , " whatt'n'ahm . " <p> Where Dennis Rodman can be as charming as any other orange-haired customer in a barber 's chair and Bob Uecker is Mr. Baseball . <p> It 's a world where golfer Greg ( the Shark ) Norman gets cut off on an expressway ( " Out here you 're just like everybody else . Nobody cares about your 40-foot birdie putt last weekend . " ) until he gives the gas to his Chevy truck . <p> A world of slick make-believe <p> TV commercials pitched during sports events or featuring athletes have become such an important part of our pop culture , polls are now conducted to identify the most popular ones on Super Bowl Sunday . There is a growing fascination with the ways advertisers fill their 30-second spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The advertisements have matured from the days when Yogi Berra held up a chocolate beverage and said " I 'm for Yoo-Hoo . " They 've become slick , cinematic triumphs worthy of really big screens . They 're often so entertaining that the subtle product message gets lost . Quick , now , is Griffey selling shoes , gloves or a sports drink as he 's fading back to Santa Monica ? <p> They utilize the newest technology . Using the same computer magic that placed Forrest Gump in the middle of just about every historic event in modern history , Pepsi rolled out a new commercial last week in which the Orlando Magic 's Shaquille O'Neal becomes part of old TV shows and movies . He appears in " I Love Lucy " helping Ethel and Lucy wrap bonbons on an assembly line . In " The Honeymooners , " Shaq sits down next to Ralph Kramden ( Jackie Gleason ) and Kramden 's eyes practically pop out of his head as the two catch sight of each other . <p> With a big-time , 60-second spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lengths to recreate exotic locations . Michael Jordan really is n't jogging through the Himalayas in search of the secret of life . The guru Jordan finds to inform him , " Life is a sport . Drink it up , " is actually sitting on a set in Arizona . <p> Art imitates sports <p> Occasionally , an advertiser will react quickly enough for a timely spot . Nike filmed Jordan parodying his attempt at baseball just as he was heading back to the NBA . The spot aired in the opening round of the NBA playoffs . <p> In the commercial , Jordan walks into an empty gym and says , " I had this dream . I retired . " Headlines heralding his retirement flash on the screen . " I became a weak hitting Double-A outfielder with a below average arm , " Jordan says over footage of him striking out for the Birmingham Barons . He sits in a diner and recalls having $ 16 a day meal allowance . " Can you imagine it ? " he says as he is shown back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ca n't . " <p> Many of these commercials are done by people without sports backgrounds . For the " Guerilla Tennis " commercial , in which Sampras and Agassi take their game to the streets , Nike 's ad agency turned to Spike Jonze , a director best-known for music videos of the rock groups Beastie Boys and Weezer . <p> It was shot like a music video , with quick takes from multiple cameras , using an audio track that captures the players ' every grunt . While the spot seems to personify the spirit of Nike 's slogan " Just Do It , " its goal is to sell a friendly image of tennis players rather than comfortable shoes . <p> Packaged goods <p> A year ago , the state of tennis was being examined by the media . A Sports Illustrated story claimed the game is " played by pampered , insolent children , run by overtanned businessmen and governed by quarrelsome organizations . " <p> " Our advertising agency Wieden and Kennedy really took offense and said , hey , players have a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rob DeFlorio , the Nike ad manager , said . " They said if conventional tennis does n't display that , maybe we can take it to the streets , take it to the people , and show that the guys are really accessible , love the game , want to have a lot of fun . . . " <p> However , the tennis players were paid very well to come off as warm and cuddly - just another acting job . The average one-year commercial contract is worth $ 25,000-$ 35,000 , but some athletes will sign a contract for $ 15,000 . <p> Michael Jordan is in a league of his own , requiring a five-year deal , or the equivalent of a five-year deal , for $ 1 million per year . <p> Before they spend that kind of money , most companies research the popularity of potential spokespersons . They check with people like Steven Levitt , whose company , Marketing Evaluations/TVQ , tracks the appeal of everything from brand names and TV shows to athletes and their sports . He regularly publishes TVQ ratings or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a measure of appeal or enthusiasm among people with an opinion . " <p> It 's all in the numbers <p> The TVQs confirm the public 's displeasure with baseball players . " The best we can say is the most popular stars are the retired players , " Levitt said . The active player with the highest Q rating is Griffey , whose rating of 47 is up from last year 's 35 . Cal Ripken Jr . is next with 39 , followed by Barry Bonds ( 36 ) and the Braves ' David Justice ( 33 ) . <p> " The most appealing sports for men are football , with a rating of 57 , fishing ( 37 ) , NBA basketball ( 31 ) , baseball ( 28 ) and figure skating ( 21 ) , " Levitt said . <p> Compare those numbers to Jordan 's popularity among NBA fans . A year ago , his rating was 70 . Today , it 's 80 . " The conclusion is Michael is hotter than he 's ever been , " Levitt said . Shaq is second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just behind Charles Barkley ( 49 ) . <p> The rest of the field also is dominated by males . " The sports world is dominated by men , whether we like it or not , " Burns said . " Women 's products tend to promote the femininity of the product : you can be beautiful , you can be graceful . Somehow , a female athlete does not represent total femininity as well as a model or actress . Chris Evert , who is extremely feminine , was much busier than the other tennis players because she has that appeal that fits into commercials . " <p> Viewers , it turns out , would rather watch Larry Bird win a burger with a trick shot .
