Balieve it or not , this made0for-TV-family , the Stewarts of Malibu , Calif. , really exists . The Brothers Court Sucess Doug Stewart was the best 14-year-old tennis player in the United States last year . He was ranked No. 1 by the U.S. Tennis Association ( USTA ) in the 14-and-under age group , then he proved he deserved the ranking by winning the USTA Boys 14 National Championships in San Antonio , Tex , , last August . He played on U.S. teams in France , Mexico and Japan , and he had a 52-2 tournament record within the United States during the year . But his record in his own backyard was n't quite as im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , practiced with Doug almost every day on the court at their home near the Pacific Ocean . Scott also is a nationally ranked junior player and one of the best in southern Califorinia in his age group . " He usually wins , " Doug says . " When I pay him , I want to win , " scott says . But it 's not a vicious thing . It 's pretty much forgotten afterwards . " The brothers were teammates on the Malibu High School tennis team during the 1998-99 school year . Scott was a sophomore and Doug a freshman , but they played in different age groups in junior competition until this year . Because of a rule change , they will play in the same age group until Scott turns 17 in October . Their father and coach , Forrest , hopes they do n't wind up playing each other in a tounament . " If that were to happen , I do n't know what we 'd do , " he says . " We might have to call it a draw . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Doug are alike off the court too , what with their straight-A averages , top-student honors and math awards . Both have been Scouts since the first grade , and they completed their Eagle Scout service projects together last year with Troop 224 . They also have a raquet-stringing business to make extra money . Their mom says that despite their similiar accomplishments , Doug and Scott are far from identical . " They are very , very different , " Kris Stewart says . " That 's what makes it interesting . " Scott is considerably taller , more outgoing and much neater . He is comfortable speaking in front of crowds . ( He even won a speech contest . ) Doug is most comfortable on a tennis court . The Start of a Champion Despite being younger , Doug took up tennis before Scott . // <p>
