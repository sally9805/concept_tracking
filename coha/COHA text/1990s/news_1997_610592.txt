<p> The youngest do-it-yourselfers for the 1990s are hard at work . Kids are painting designs on latte mugs , hammering together wooden CD holders , sewing kente cloth scrunchies and molding their own fish-shaped glycerin soaps . <p> With them , almost every tap and stitch of the way , are parents grateful for a detour off the fast lane and happy for a convenient mode of getting their hands dirty with their kids . But not too dirty . <p> New programs and products that market crafts are targeting time-crunched parents and heavily scheduled kids . Aimed at the population bulge of baby boomers ' school-age offspring , this growing hands-on world includes paint-your-own pottery studios , woodworking workshops and educational pre-assembled craft kits . Whether the experience is at home or away , the goal is easy access to wood , fabric and clay . Above all , they encourage imagination , letting little hands create in a non-competitive atmosphere . <p> " That immediate sense of touch is extraordinarily important . Nothing can replace it , " says Michael Monroe , executive director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of this century , the most technological period in our history . The need of contact with physical materials and finding a way to express ourselves in those means is even more important . We need to introduce kids to that experience . " <p> Some money-pinched school systems have been forced to cut opportunities in the arts as well as in practical skills such as woodworking , according to Monroe and other experts . Parents have been searching for other ways to enhance their kids ' developmental skills  --  as well as an alternative to watching TV . Doing craft projects with children is easier if someone else has organized the moving parts , says Joanne Oppenheim , co-author of the annual Oppenheim guides to best toys , books and videos . " There have always been crafts . I 'm a grandmother . I remember doing plaster molds and tin hammering and my brother having a woodburning kit . " She recalls spending time gathering craft materials to work with her own children . Her take on the pre-packaged kits and the classes : Parental participation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ households with two working parents , has many such opportunities for families , whether its molding gargoyles at the Washington National Cathedral 's Medieval Workshops or taking a Hirshhorn Museum seminar on Polynesian crafts inspired by a Gauguin exhibit . <p> " Parents are looking for projects that have some learning as well as play value , " says Oppenheim . <p> Crafts have taken on a new level of sophistication in the 1990s , thanks in part to the wide-ranging influence of Martha Stewart . Says Susan Magsamen , founder of the Curiosity Kits line of craft products based in Cockeysville , Md. : " Martha Stewart has heightened the bar on making things . She has taken adult crafts out of pompons and plastics into an understanding of art and home decor . " <p> There are Curiosity Kits to make potpourri sachets , mosaic pottery and stained glass . You can construct clay bead jewelry , an old-fashioned sock monkey or a kaleidoscope . The kits contain everything : the right size screwdriver , sandpaper , pins and glue . The average price of the 50 kits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kits , meant for ages 4 through 12 , are sold at small stores and museum shops , not toy superstores . <p> " Parents need help , " says Magsamen . " They want to give children thoughtful and careful attention . We are pulled in so many directions . Parents do n't have time to pull together all the ingredients . " <p> Curiosity Kits , which last year had sales of almost $ 1 million , began about 10 years ago when Magsamen and her husband turned their experience at a children 's arts camp into a series of hand-packaged craft kits . Soon , they were wholesaling the kits , which explore the arts , sciences , make-believe and world cultures . For example , the Crazy Clay Bugs kit includes entomological facts about 14 bugs that a child molds and bakes out of clay . The Russian Folk Doll kit instructs children on how to cut and sew a Russian rag doll , complete with babushka and twine braids . <p> " Crafts should n't be disconnected from the world we live in , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find resources to let kids work with their hands . But building with your hands builds self-esteem . " <p> Doing crafts at your own speed is an important part of the process . " When you make things , you slow down . You connect with materials . You ca n't rush . There are no shortcuts , " says Magsamen . " It 's in the smallest details you get the greatest pleasure . " <p> The smallest clients at Kiln ' Time , a paint-your-own-pottery studio in Alexandria , are sometimes only weeks old . Parents trace infants ' footprints or handprints onto a plate for posterity . <p> Painting on pre-made bisque-ware bowls , pitchers and tiles is a 1990s phenomenon that began in California and has spread to a neighborhood near you . It 's a kid-friendly trend . Look in the window of a pottery place and you 'll find a host of strollers parked by parents painting platters with one hand and holding a baby bottle in the other . In the after-school hours , older kids work alongside . <p> Located in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the area pottery studios that provides an attractive and comfortable atmosphere for family togetherness . The tables are covered with brown kraft paper . In addition to the pottery , there are pieces of canvas for making floor cloths and sheets of candy-colored beeswax that can be rolled to make candles . <p> Manager Melissa Miller says more than half of the adult customers at the studio , which opened two years ago , bring their kids along with them . <p> On a recent weekday , Christina Roman , 9 , her friend , Kimberly Felt , 8 , and Christina 's mom , Regina Roman , were painting projects at the front window table . Says Christina , " I think it 's cool . I made some mugs , and now I 'm making a tile with fish on it . My Dad went on a fishing trip . I want to give it to him . " <p> Regina Roman says the studio fills many needs . " It 's a nice place to work in and it fosters creativity . You have the ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've never seen them so concentrated . " Roman says it saves her time . " Projects that are simple and do n't cost much still require a lot of time to assemble at home . If you work full time , you do n't have time to gather pine cones . " <p> Kiln ' Time stocks pottery bears , bunnies and turtles for kids to decorate . One recent birthday party for 6-year-old girls featured tea at the Morrison House hotel across the street and then a miniature tea-set painting session at Kiln ' Time afterward . <p> This summer , they started their first craft classes for ages 7 to 11 . Kids could choose to make four ceramic plates or a painted floorcloth over a three-day period . Cody Wright , 10 , designed a mat with a big orange jaguar and a rain forest in the background . " I 'd rather come here than an outside camp , " he says . <p> " Kids have less fear about art , " says Lisa Wilson , an employee of Kiln ' Time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lawyer Larry Gold of Takoma Park was worrying about litigation and court dates until he bagged the corporate world two years ago to take up woodworking classes for kids . " What 's all the hammering about ? " says the KidShop company T-shirt , sold at Gold 's workshop in an old office building in the District 's Old Town Takoma Park neighborhood . <p> Now his immaculately organized workshop with its wall of kid-size tools and low workbenches is the full-time venture of Gold and his wife , Linda Kahn . Parents who do n't know a Japanese pull-saw from a hand drill are happy to drop off their kids and return several hours later to pick them up happily clutching a finished project . Or parents can take classes with their children and brush up on lost skills , producing pieces such as marble mazes and bird houses . <p> " For kids , there is no line between art and craft , " says Gold . His classes stress the process of understanding how to break a complicated project into steps and finishing it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They learn there is order and process to doing things . A goal you work toward in small steps . " He is still astonished at the children 's wonderment about the building process . <p> " I did n't realize that woodworking had really gone from many people 's lives on a day-to-day basis . Activities that require substantial time have lost out to those that are more immediate . " <p> At a summer program earlier this month , 12 kids constructed treasure trunks using hand drills and awls and hinges . " I like to build with wood and do a lot with nails , " says Gracie Shanks , 9 , who was thrilled with her trunk that she planned to use as a storage chest for her growing collection of Beanie Babies . " We do n't do much building at home . About the only time we use a screwdriver is to replace batteries for a toy . " <p> Woodworking and other craft skills such as sewing used to be passed down from one generation to the other . As that has lessened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids never have been exposed to threading a needle or hammering a nail . <p> " What we do here is the antithesis of passive activities kids do today , like watching TV or videos or computer games , " says Gold . KidShop clients take home wooden CD holders , bug houses , pet food bowl trays and doll beds they have made . " It 's delightful to see the sense of satisfaction in their faces . " <p> Janis Sartucci has brought her son , Matthew , 6 , here five times . He made a bird feeder and airplane . " It gives him confidence , " she says . " He participates in holiday gift giving . He 's able to give something he has made , and he 's proud of it . Its not a sport , so things are stress-free , there 's no parents screaming , ' Get a goal . ' And yet there is a goal . " <p> Gold instructs students in fine points such as how to carry a saw and how to use goggles correctly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energetic young woodworkers . " You get no points for going quickly . " <p> What a refreshing concept .
