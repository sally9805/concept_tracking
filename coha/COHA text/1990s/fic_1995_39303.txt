" So you 're Tamara Hayle , " said the tall , gaunt man who walked into my office without knocking . " I 've heard you 're the best PI in Essex County . I only do business with the best . " He had flawless dark skin and thick silver-gray hair and was dressed like a banker in a navy pinstripe suit and black wing-tipped shoes . But he had the dead eyes of a street thug . Killer 's eyes , I thought to myself , even though I knew better . <p> Lincoln E. Storey was a legend in Newark . He had grown up on the meanest street in the toughest ward in the city and had made money 's mama on Wall Street . But the photos that ran in Black Enterprise and the local paper never seemed to capture the predatory glint in his eyes . <p> " Yes , I 'm Tamara Hayle . Would you like to sit down ? " I asked . <p> " I assume you know who I am . " <p> " Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I hated the ingratiating sound of my voice , but it was too late to call it back . " What can I do for you , Mr. Storey ? " <p> " I 'll get to that , " he snapped . His tone caught me short , but I tossed him a sugary smile , deciding in that instant to let it lie . For " the best PI in Essex County , " I was as broke as hell . With a 1982 Jetta that needed a new transmission and a big-mouthed teenage son to feed , being anything but pleasant to the biggest client who had ever graced my funky little office would be just plain foolish . <p> " Could I get you something to drink , Mr. Storey ? A cup of tea ? " <p> " I do n't drink tea . " <p> " How about some coffee ? " <p> " Freshly brewed ? " <p> " Sorry , I do n't have a pot . Instant okay ? " <p> " I do n't drink that shit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , but I swallowed the urge to tell him to kiss my behind . <p> " You 're licensed by the state ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " What kind of things do you handle ? " <p> " Anything that comes my way . Disappearances . Missing persons . Insurance fraud . " <p> " And your rates ? " <p> " Depends on the job , plus all my expenses . " <p> " And you 're worth the money ? " <p> " That 's what they tell me . " <p> " Do you find this line of work hard for a woman , a Black woman ? " <p> " No harder than being a cop . " <p> " Why did you leave ? " <p> " I got sick of it , " I said , wondering how much he knew about me . <p> " Sick of ... " <p> " Sick of being called a nigger bitch by my brethren in blue every day of my beat , " I said , the old anger coloring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat , and our eyes locked ; a glint of something I could n't read came and left his eyes . <p> " Discretion means as much to me as money , " he said , out of nowhere . <p> " I know how to keep my mouth shut . " <p> " You do surveillance work ? " <p> " I 've done it . " <p> " You like it ? " <p> " It depends . " <p> " On ? " <p> " On who I 'm following and where they lead me . " <p> He smiled a crooked smile that told me nothing . " I need to get some ... information on somebody . He paused . <p> " I need to know every bit of shit I can possibly get . Do you understand me ? " <p> The way he lost control  --  his lower lip trembling , his eyes squinting  --  was downright scary . <p> " I take it this is somebody who has betrayed your trust ? " I asked neutrally , cooling my voice against the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he sleeps and who he fucks , " he answered bluntly . <p> " Does he sleep with someone you know ? " I asked innocently , making my voice sister-gentle , willing to share a brother 's pain . Somebody you sleep with ? <p> He straightened his back , uncrossed his legs , folded his hands . " My stepdaughter , " he said after a minute . " I assume they 're sleeping together . My stepdaughter , Alexa , is involved with this person , this character . I do n't trust him . I suspect he likes my money more than he likes my stepdaughter , and I want to find out everything I can about him . " <p> " So what 's his name ? " <p> " Brandon Pike " <p> " Brandon Pike : " I repeated the name as if I 'd never heard it before , but it had hit me like a fast , hard punch in the gut-lower , because when I had known and loved him , that was where Brandon Pike had hurt me : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " You know him , then ? " He watched my eyes as they dropped . I forced them back up , confronting his . <p> " Years ago ... not well . " <p> Storey appeared to buy it . " He has been seeing Alexa for about a year . She 's 23 . Trying to ' find ' herself . He 's come into her life . After my money , anyone can tell that . She 's got nothing to offer him . He 's that kind of man . My wife , Daphne , and I are very concerned . " His eyes sought mine for a reaction , and then he continued . " If I can get something on him , I can confront her with it . It 's clear she has nothing to give him . " <p> What is he giving her ? I asked myself , because that was Brandon 's special talent . I had spent the years after our affair trying to figure him out : And all I really knew in the end was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ex , DeWayne Curtis , with my head high , and Brandon Pike had brought it low , lower than I would ever let it fall for any man again . <p> " I want you to follow him . Find out what you can on him , " Storey continued . <p> " What can you tell me about him now ? " I asked , slipping into my professional mode again . <p> Storey looked at me blankly , ignoring my question . <p> " I 'm giving a fund-raiser that I want you to come to tonight . In Belvington Heights , for Stella Pharr . Stella Pharr . " <p> " Tonight ? " <p> " Yes , for Stella Pharr , " he said , repeating the name for the third time . <p> I 'd heard the name before but could n't place it . Storey certainly seemed to relish the sound of it . <p> " Yes . Deputy District Attorney . She 's running for state assembly . Alexa , Daphne , Pike . They 'll all be there . At Tate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now it 's on Fullbright in Belvington Heights . " <p> " Yes , I know the place . " Jackson Tate , the owner , had grown to manhood with my father on Howard Street . <p> " Bring a friend if you want . I 'll tell Tate to bill me . I own him . " <p> " You own Tate ? " I asked , not disguising the surprised disgust in my voice . <p> But Storey did n't seem to hear it . He reached into his suit pocket , took a checkbook and scribbled out a check . My heart skipped a beat as I noticed the one and three loopy zeros scratched with the tip of his Mont Blanc fountain pen . <p> " Under no circumstances do I want my wife or stepdaughter to know anything about all this . " He paused . " For obvious reasons . " <p> " As I said before , I know how to keep my mouth shut . " <p> " Get to Tate 's before nine . Watch Pike carefully . See who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see you tonight ? " he asked , suddenly anxious . <p> I glanced at my watch . It was 4:30 , but I figured I 'd have time to stop by the bank , pick up a pizza for my son , Jamal , and call my best girlfriend , Annie , to see if she could hang out at Tate 's tonight . <p> " Tonight is fine , " I said , smiling my sweet , professional smile ; Storey 's check was already burning a hole in my pocket . <p> " I think we can do business together , Ms. Hayle , " he said with a tight smile . <p> As he reached for his coat on the rack and turned to leave , a sharp , hard rap on the door drew the attention of us both . <p> " You in there , Tamara ? " It was Wyvetta Green , my good friend and neighbor , who owns and runs the beauty shop downstairs . <p> " Wyvetta , I have somebody in here with me . A client ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her off . <p> " Oh , girl , I 'm sorry ... " she said as soon as she spotted Lincoln Storey , but just as quickly the smile dropped from her face . <p> Storey , with a look that could have turned hell cold , stepped away from both of us , his eyes darting nervously to Wyvetta , then back to me and finally settling on Wyvetta . He swept his rich-man 's cashmere coat over his shoulders and nearly knocked me over in his rush to get out the door . <p> " Wyvetta , do you know ... ? " <p> " Yeah , I know him , " Wyvetta said , cutting me o her eyes filled with contempt . And then she spit twice , like a cat , in the path Storey had cut , and her spittle spread in a thin , nasty line down the hall . <p> After Storey had gotten down the hall good , I asked Wyvetta why she 'd spit at the man the way she had . She looked at me blankly and told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or she would n't be responsible for the state of my head next time I sat my behind down in her chair . I took that to mean I should mind my own business . Wyvetta and I are friends , but not the kind of friends who share the dust balls hidden in the corners of our lives . <p> Later that evening at the fund-raiser at Tate 's , the champagne was flowing nicely as Annie and I settled ourselves in . We 'd been there for about an hour when the reason for my invitation came strolling in . <p> Brandon Pike had told me once that women always smiled at him , their good wishes sending him on his way . He walked into Tate 's on a wave of female admiration , smiling seductively at nobody in particular . I was amused as I watched him , amazed at his unshakable sense of entitlement to the kindness of women . <p> But he was an uncommonly good-looking brother , I had to give him that . Lithe and muscular like a pro football wide receiver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confidence . His skin , a deep brown , was as smooth as a baby 's belly , and his hair was cut short , almost to his scalp , like a warriors . But his eyes were what got you  --  haunting eyes that smiled and spoke of delight between the sheets . <p> Those eyes got big when they spotted me . I held them for a moment , just for the hell of it , emptying my face of any expression , and then grinned a fake , silly grin . He tossed me a smile of acknowledgment and then turned to the sweet young thing who held his arm so tightly she creased his suit . <p> Alexa Storey looked younger than her 23 years , and her body had a girlish coming-into-womanhood plumpness about it . Her long , dark chestnut hair was parted in the middle and piled on top of her head , and small pitted scars on her cheeks and forehead hinted that she 'd fought and lost a bout with adolescent acne . There was an awkwardness about the way she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , as if asking permission to linger on a particular person or object . <p> Her mother , Daphne Storey , who followed behind them , was the same height as Alexa but leaner , and I realized with a twinge of envy that I 'd seen the black silk dress that draped her size-four body at a boutique for a high three figures . Her only piece of jewelry was a solitaire diamond ring resting on her left hand like the egg of a small bird . Her eyes were the same hazel as her daughter 's , but her almond skin was flawless and her hair light brown . Courtesy of L'Oreal , I told myself in self-indulgent cattiness . Lincoln Storey , murmuring greetings to those in his wake , oiled his way through the crowd to reach his family . <p> " That 's him , is n't it ? " My friend Annie asked anxiously . <p> " Lincoln Storey ? " <p> " No , fool ! Brandon Pike . " <p> " Yeah , it 's him . " <p> " I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room ! " <p> " Well , you must have heard your own because mine are firmly on my behind . " <p> " He 's certainly come up in the world . God , I ca n't wait to tell my mother that I saw him with Alexa Storey , Jewel 's granddaughter . Daphne Winston Samson Storey is Jewel Winston 's daughter . My mother hates Jewel Winston . " <p> " Hates her ? Why ? " <p> " You know Mama 's a big club woman , or at least she was before her stroke . Anyway , Jewel Winston , Missus Dr. Daniel J. Winston , Daphne 's mother , black-balled Mama when she tried to get into the old Negro Ladies ' Culture Circle in the fifties . Said she was too dark . Mama still gets mad talking about it . " <p> " Too dark ? Thank God we 're finally through that mess , " I said , shaking my head in disgust . <p> Annie looked at me in amazement . " Sweetie , where have you been ? Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looks like Kate Moss with a weave , tits and a tan . <p> " Anyway , color was very big in Daphne 's family , and they made no secret of it . They came up from Atlanta in the forties . Old , tired , Negro-doctor money , thank you . Mama always said she thought they were a little bit weird , a little strange with their color-struck selves . <p> " Mama like to died laughing when Daphne 's first husband , Alexander Samson , kicked the bucket and did n't leave her a pot to pee in . Mama does have her edge . But ole Daphne did n't make that mistake the second time around ; Storey 's bank account definitely Europeanized those African genes . " Annie cackled like a witch , and I shook my head and gave her an amused , reproachful look . <p> Tasha Green , Wyvetta 's baby sister , who owned her own catering business and was doing the affair , came by with a tight , phony smile pasted on her face and a tray laden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guacamole . Annie and I grabbed as much as we could without looking tacky . I had another glass of wine , and we sat down across from each other at one of the tiny tables . <p> " This is something , is n't it ? " Annie said , looking around the room as she sipped her champagne , and I nodded in agreement . Even though Tate had left my hometown of Newark for the rich , rarefied air of Belvington Heights , it still made me proud just to know the place belonged to a Black man . It was one of the classiest , fanciest places in the state . <p> " This is what I call a mix-and-money crowd , " Annie added as she surveyed the people who were standing , scheming and schmoozing . " Ever wonder how money smells , Tamara ? Take a whiff ! " <p> Money did n't have a smell , but it had a look , and you could definitely see it at Tate 's tonight . From the Rolexes that gleamed on strong ebony wrists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money echoed in the bursts of laughter erupting from the circles of Brooks Brothers men and in the proud looks tossed by their thin , stylish women . <p> " This is the real stuff , too ! " Annie glanced with admiration at her glass . " The good French stuff and did you check out the bathroom yet ? " <p> " The bathroom ? " <p> " Go do it , girl , before it gets too crowded . It 's like something out of Architectural Digest ! " <p> We both giggled like teenagers , and I headed back past the kitchen toward the back of the restaurant . <p> Annie was right . The walls and floor of the huge ladies ' room were covered with what looked like hundreds of tiny black tiles ; the golden fixtures on the sink shone like the real thing . I primped in front of the gilded mirrors for a couple of minutes , grinning at myself , playing with my hair , spraying cologne from the fancy bottles on the i counter , even pumping a squirt of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the cologne . I promised myself that I would bite the bullet and bring my son , Jamal , here for his next birthday , even though I knew that once he saw this place , Red Lobster would be history . <p> I ducked into one of the stalls and then sat down , got back up and sat back down on the toilet seat several times trying to figure out how it knew when to flush by itself . I was finally ready to leave when I heard two women come in through the outer door . I stayed put . <p> " Why wo n't you listen to me , Alexa ? " said Daphne Storey . " Why wo n't you just listen to me ? " <p> There 's nowhere like a public bathroom for overhearing intimate conversations , and since I 'd already decided that Alexa was the one I 'd tail , I pulled my feet up and squatted on the toilet seat so no one could see me . Two high-heeled shoes clicked past my stall and then someone knocked on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's locked because it 's broken , " Daphne Storey said irritably . " After all the money Lincoln paid for this damned place , that fool Tate hired some second-rate plumber to fix the toilets . " <p> " He told me it was n't true . I believe him . Why is n't that enough for you ? " Alexa said , answering her mother 's first question . <p> " Lincoln says it is , and he 's out to destroy him , and you know that he will . There 'll be nothing left of him when Lincoln is finished . Why do n't you listen to me ? " <p> " Since when in this lifetime have you believed anything that asshole says ? " <p> " Do n't talk about your stepfather like that ! " <p> " As if it really mattered a beggar 's fuck to you . " <p> " And do n't use that kind of language around me . Your mouth is as filthy as a Springfield Avenue whore 's . " <p> " Just like my mama 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " What else is new ? " <p> Someone turned on the water , and I heard it splash as if she were washing her face . <p> " Do you have any lipstick , Mommy ? Alexa asked . " I forgot mine at home . " <p> " You 'd forget your fat ass if it were n't hanging on your back . " <p> It was the little-girl tone that shocked me even more than the mother 's ugly , hurtful reply . There was such longing for approval and so little of it coming ; the lack of it tugged my heart . For a moment I had an impulse to cough , kick my foot against the door , do anything not to be privy to the sad bond between these women . But I knew I could n't . I had been paid big money to find some truths that involved Alexa . I could n't blow my cover because I did n't like what I was hearing . The truth of the matter is that what I do for a living usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln Storey had paid me handsomely for my shovel . I stayed put , my legs doubled up against my butt , and when they started talking again , I listened . <p> " Who do you think you 're bullshitting ? I know why you hate him . You probably wish you were fucking him . " <p> " How many times have I told you not to talk to me like that ? " <p> " Where do you think I learned it ? " <p> " Why do you torture me , Alexa ? Everything I have done in my life I 've done for you . Do you think it 's been easy for me  --  this , and those little tricks you play with your life ? " <p> They were both silent for a minute . <p> " He 's getting ready to toast her . We 'd better get out there , " Daphne said . <p> " Why do you put up with it , Mommy ? Why do you let him put you down like this " The awkward voice of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I hate you sometimes . For putting that shit on me . I hate you ! " <p> " You are the most important thing in my life , Alexa . You must never forget that . No matter what you say to me , you must know you are the most important thing in my life . " <p> " If he left me , I 'd be better off dead . " <p> " You 're as much a fool as your dead fool of a father . " <p> I heard the outer door close as one of the women left the room , and then I heard the other enter one of the stalls and begin to weep . And then suddenly she began to kick the stall door hard , like an angry kid throwing a tantrum . She stopped after a minute and left the bathroom . <p> Had it been Alexa or Daphne ? <p> I waited and then got up , stretched out my legs and walked out , too . The crowd was bigger now , and I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my table . I searched the room for a moment , but when I finally found them , I could see no cracks in their armor . <p> The next thing that happened was so sudden there was no time to do anything . Later we were left with nothing to do but stand around in sad circles , talking quietly of the stealth of death . <p> At first I thought Storey was having a fit . He stood up abruptly , as straight as if he were going to follow his words of praise for Stella Pharr with some additional witticism , a look of surprise on his face . But then he began to claw and grab at his throat , tearing at his own flesh as if trying to rip something out . With the other hand he began to reach for something or somebody , maybe for Daphne , his wife , but she remained riveted to the spot where she sat , her eves filled with horror . There were a couple of self-conscious titters from people in the room at first , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night to a humorous end . But then his lips and face began to swell , turning purple and stretching . Within moments they seemed to be twice their natural size , his features distorted and ugly like those of a ghoul on a Halloween mask . There was utter silence as he began to wheeze and gasp , both hands now around his throat as if he were choking himself to death . His breaths came short and fast then . Saliva spewed from his mouth , spraying the people sitting close to him . There was one final gasp before he fell over , soiling his pants . <p> We knew then that Lincoln Storey was dead . <p> " I guess the party 's over , " somebody said , in either incredible innocence or the most tasteless attempt at gallows humor I 'd ever heard in my life . <p> But he was right . <p> Valerie Wilson Wesley is an editor-at-large of this magazine and the author of When Death Comes Stealing ( Avon Books , paperback , $5.95 ) , the first Tamara Hayle mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him , a Tamara Hayle mystery by Valerie Wilson Wesley , published in July 1995 by Putnam Publishing Group ( C ) 1995 Valerie Wilson Wesley . <p>
