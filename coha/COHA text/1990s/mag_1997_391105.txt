With a mix of technology and tenacity , Ivan Stewart braves the Baja 500. // WITH AN OUTLINE resembling a tarantula poised on heavily lugged tires , the truck 's screens , shields , and tube frame are visible underneath its carbon-fiber body , ready to defend the vehicle against violent physical assault . The windshield is a black cavity , the glass gone , the opening framed in more steel tubing , an ominous cage with driver Ivan Stewart 's face barely visible inside . The truck looks for all the world like an invader from the dark side of the moon ; with the crackling engine idling in traffic , you ca n't imagine what this strange beast 's purpose might be . Actually , Stewart 's truck is designed for one of the most unusual motorsports events in the world : a race where the duel to finish first becomes almost incidental to the real challenge-surviving the course in one piece . It 's the Baja 500 , and Stewart 's truck is just one of the entrants passing slowly through the crowds toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the foothills of the Sierra Juarez mountains that form the spine of Baja California-the western Mexican peninsula that juts south into the Pacific Ocean-are some of the worst in the world . These trails are fashioned more by chance , water , or weather than by any design for vehicular traffic . Anything on wheels is at risk . Even the taxi drivers in Ensenada tend to calculate potential damage to shock absorbers or the chance of a cracked frame before accepting a fare up here , and are as likely as not to turn down the would-be passenger with a polite shrug . A burro is the conveyance of choice in this neardesert , able to pick its way among the melon-size rocks , amble easily though the El Rayo pine forest , and keep its balance on steep mountain turns that double back in blind corners with shoulders soft enough to give away underfoot when you stop for the view . The raw challenge of the locale lured a few hardy souls in 1969 to try a long-distance road race through these byways with a motley collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally developed for desert racing . The Baja 500 quickly established its own mystique . In a region where both countryside and lifestyles are rugged , the difficulties of the terrain are compounded by the vagaries of the course . Getting lost is not only easy-it is dangerous in the desert heat if fuel runs out . An off-road racing enthusiast who started driving dune buggies in high school , Ivan Stewart trekked to Ensenada in 1970 as a spectator and was instantly hooked . " It was the adventure that appealed to me , " he says . Most of the racers use a partner to navigate , but Stewart insists on driving the entire race single-handed , earning him the nickname Ironman . Now , after 25 races and 14 first-place finishes in his class , he is the grand master of the circuit . The starters are arranged roughly by speed potential , with motorcycles first , then the big trophy-class trucks , then the **25;1917;TOOLONG of the lot , rolling steel cages with highly modified engines hanging out the rear . The lineup eventually trails off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night or early in the morning . The trucks start 60 seconds apart , creating a single file that by day 's end will stretch half the length of the course . Passing is difficult , made more so by the clouds of dust that blanket the road behind each speeding vehicle . You pray the night before for rain , or failing that , for a light wind to blow the dust clear . Stewart 's truck epitomizes the top class at the Baja these days . The body shell is fabricated to resemble a Toyota T100 pickup , but all that remains of the production vehicle is the chromed plastic grille . The lightweight body skins over a tube-framed , midengine vehicle designed specifically to traverse extremely rough terrain . The suspension has been developed and refined to absorb the pounding of high speeds while maintaining control . The wheels have a free travel of some 26 vertical inches , while the shock absorbers are huge , carefully designed units that pump the fluid through external coolers . With this kind of suspension , a truck can leap several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stewart has posted most of his remarkable record driving V6powered trucks with several hundred horsepower less than his competition . This year 's race debuts the 500horsepower 4.9-liter V8 engine , based on the new T100 truck V8 . The power boost should give him a significant advantage , assuming the brand-new engine holds together under racing conditions . Photograph The Baja 500 runs from Ensenada , through the mountains , and across the desert before coming back to the sea . // Before the race begins , Stewart pre-runs the course in a modified Toyota Land Cruiser , explaining a technique of driving that at first glance seems simply insane . " Coming into a corner , you can read the terrain , " he says , while I 'm staring ahead at a road that seems simply to disappear into a small grove of trees . He looks closely at the berms on the edge of the road : " A small berm : tight corner ; large berm : fast corner . " A curious lack of up-and-down motion is testimony to Stewart 's ability to almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all wheels maintain contact . The pre-run allows Stewart to stamp each corner into his prodigious memory of the course . He says he can run a mental video of each section , an ability he demonstrated in post-race arguments . Regardless , the course is never quite the same twice . Passing vehicles chew it up , as can the weather . Rocks are kicked onto it , and ruts deepen . Even the spectator gets into the act sometimes . It is considered fair game for fans to build obstacles to trip up the passing trucks : Such sabotage ranges from creating deep holes to rolling logs onto the course . Trail markers are knocked down or removed . Ribbons tied to bushes to mark the course seem to end up in the hair of young girls . Stewart 's team is finely tuned , from the pit crews to the chase trucks that crisscross the course carrying spare parts . The former have a task not unlike intercepting a space shuttle . They have one shot at the truck as it comes roaring out of the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dump 40 gallons of gas into the tank . Stewart gets a new pair of goggles , water , and a candy bar . Then the pit-stop crew packs up . On race day , Stewart starts in the lead and stays there all day . He drives with precision , up through the foothills to the pine forest , where several cars will roll over later in the day ; then down to run along the beach . In past years , unforeseen difficulties have popped up . Flat tires have had to be changed single-handed , while spectators absconded with the lug wrench . There was an encounter with lost , naked motorcyclists in the desert . One year , victory seemed certain , with Stewart holding a 7-minute advantage through the rough terrain , only to lose the lead on the beach when a high-horsepower contender roared from behind . This year , however , all is going as planned , save for a brief moment when the pit crew fixes a sticky throttle linkage . Stewart finishes some 38 minutes ahead , a new record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach the finish line , then swamps his car , looking for autographs . Tired as he is after 9 hours and 48 minutes over the brutal course , he obliges .
