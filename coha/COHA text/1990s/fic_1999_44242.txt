The countdown to the millennium just stopped short ! <p> On the TV , the ball in Times Square hangs motionless maybe four feet from the ground . In our living room , my parents and a bunch of their friends are also motionless . The bubbles in Mr. Petersen 's glass of ginger ale have stopped rising . Mrs. Stevens is squinting into the mirror of her little pink makeup case , and touching a bright red lipstick to her lower lip for a big New Year 's Eve kiss . They are frozen like statues . Outside the world has gone silent . A car is stopped in the street with its lights on . Inside , cigarette smoke floats thinly in front of the driver 's face , like wispy gray cotton candy . " Scott Pooley ? " a voice says behind me . I spin around . Coming down the sidewalk in the dark is Chloe Frost . Of all the people ... " Have you seen anyone else ? " she asks , hooking her beautiful blond hair behind her ear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to talk to me . " No . " " I 've looked everywhere , " she says . " How about you ? " " Just standing here . " " So weird . " Chloe shivers even though it 's not very cold and she 's wearing a jacket . Her skin is milky and flawless in the dim light . It 's pretty much that way in the day too . She crosses her arms and looks around , probably for something , anything , that could give her a reason to get away from me . " I was at Angie Sunburn 's party , " she says . " Everyone was counting down and then ... everything just stopped . Every clock , wristwatch ... Where were you ? " I gesture back up the walk at my house . Chloe makes a face . " The biggest New Year 's Eve in a thousand years and you 're home ? " Why are you surprised , Chloe ? When have you ever invited me to do anything ? She shivers again . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it . She does n't want to be alone . As soon as she finds someone else , I 'll be jettisoned like a worthless piece of space junk . On Main Street we face two people running . I mean , they were running . Now they 're frozen . His open jacket is billowing out . Her hair streams behind her . " Rushing to be somewhere at midnight , " Chloe guesses . " Maybe they 'll still make it , " I reply . Chloe blinks with surprise , as if she ca n't believe I said something half clever . We move on down the sidewalk . The lights are bright outside Umberto 's , the fanciest restaurant in town . Chloe wipes the filmy condensation off a spot on the window . Through translucent white curtains we can see motionless diners seated inside . Many of them are holding up long thin glasses for a toast . Chloe turns to me . " Ever eaten here ? " I shake my head . " Too expensive . " She smiles ruefully . " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuxedo sits at a baby grand , his hands hanging motionless over the keys . Candle flames stand at midflicker . Amid the tables a waiter is bent under a large tray of plates with silver covers . Chloe reaches up and pulls one off . " What do you feel like ? " she asks . " Uh , spaghetti and meatballs ? " She uncovers another plate . " Veal Parmesan ? " " OK . " She hands the plate to me it 's hot - then helps herself to a bowl of linguini and shrimp in a light red sauce . She takes a second plate of salad and a basket of bread and sits down at an empty table for two . I 'm rendered motionless by the irony of this . Imagine the school cafeteria on a normal day . Not in a million years would Chloe want me anywhere near her . Suddenly wide-eyed , she looks up from the table and gasps , " Scott ? " " Huh ? Oh , sorry . " I sit down . " God , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand against her chest . " For a second there I thought - " " No such luck . " I ca n't help smiling . Chloe gives me a puzzled look , then starts to wolf down linguini and shrimp like she has n't eaten in a week . She looks up and catches me watching . The fine lines in her forehead wrinkle . " What ? I 'm hungry , ok ? " I nod and start to eat . Chloe and Scott , polar opposites on the social spectrum , dining at Umberto 's . Who would believe it ? Chloe clears her plate and levels her piercing gaze at me . Goose bumps race up and down my limbs like panicked lab rats . " So , Scott , what do you think ? There has to be a reason , you know . I mean , you and me . It ca n't be an accident . " " Maybe it 's a dream , " I suggest . " Or you 'd probably say , a nightmare . " I 'm fishing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait . " Maybe there 's something we 're supposed to do , " she says . " Like the new millennium ca n't start until we take care of unfinished business . " " Ah ha ! The real Y2K problem . " I smirk , but inside I have this nervous uncomfortable feeling we both know what exactly she 's talking about . Chloe purses her lips . " I 'm serious , Scott . Look , I feel I have to say this . It 's like some massive guilt ball I have to cough up . I used to be a stuck-up snot , ok ? I admit it . But I 've changed . I do n't make fun of people anymore . Well , sometimes I do , but I try not to . I believe that people are the way they are and it 's not their fault . I mean , I could have been born you , and you could have been born me . " I wince and glance at the older man and woman seated at the table next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentration as their knives jab red steaks pinioned by fork . Hell-bent to have the next piece ready as soon as they swallow . " Scott ? " I look back at Chloe . " You really know how to make a guy feel good . " " I 'm just trying to be honest , " she insists . " Maybe I 'm happy being me , " I reply . She leans forward . " Are you ? " " No , " I admit . " But I 'm not miserable ... except when I 'm around people like you . " Chloe 's eyes widen as if she ca n't believe I just said that . Which makes two of us . " But I do n't intend to make you feel that way , " she insists . " Really . I mean , on the other hand , I ca n't be friends with everyone . " The awkwardness of this conversation borders on painful . And what 's so weird is that this was one of my most major secret dreams - talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So why am I so ticked off ? " We do n't have to talk about this , " I tell her as I cut off a piece of veal parmesan and chew it . Not bad . But Chloe persists . " Do you believe what I said ? That I 've changed ? " " How would I know ? " I answer with a shrug . Whloe leans back in her chair and lets out a big dramatic sigh . " I ca n't believe I 'm sitting here spilling my guts out ... and even you wo n't take me seriously ! " Even me ? Now , that pushes me over the edge . Like a good little graduate of an anger-management program , I finish chewing my veal . The food may be great , but everything else about this " magic " evening stinks . In my dream date with Chloe she 's supposed to realize that looks and athletic ability are n't everything . Instead she actually has the nerve to say she " sorry she 's so popular while I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spills over the secret dam I 've spent my life trying to hold back . " Do me a favor , ok ? Do n't tell me you 've changed . Because that does n't cut it . Your beautiful and smart and popular . So there 's no way you 're going to make me believe that we may actually have something in common . Some unique bond of unfulfillment that stretches from the top of the heap all the way down to the sub basement . " Chloe blinks and sits up stiffly . My heart 's pounding in my chest . Where did the courage to say these things come from ? Maybe from the notion that it finally feels like for once she needs me a lot more than I need her . I mean , we 're alone here in this timeless , motionless restaurant . And let 's face it , folks , I know about spending time alone . I got used to it a long , long time ago . Scrank ! I cut right through the veal and scrape the plate hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so tightly my knuckles have turned white . Did anyone notice ? Naw , they 're all still stiffs . Chloe starts to reach toward me . As if she 's going to put her hand on my arm and say that she understands . But I jerk my head up and give her a look that stops her cold . f " . YOu want to know why I think this is happening ? " I ask . " It 's because I 've been dreaming of this since the first time I laid eyes on you . Dreaming of this impossible moment when you and I would sit in some fancy restaurant and fall in love and all the rest of that Hollywood crap . And here it is at last . That amazing moment . Except , it 's not turning out the way I dreamed it would . And that 's because it 's a Scott Pooley dream , and nothing in my life ever comes out the way I wish it would . " " But- " " No buts , Chloe . I 'm still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ugly cheap frames because that 's all my parents can afford . The kid whose dad works parttime at the post office and whose mom plays organ in the church on Sunday morning . The kid who gets too flustered to give the right answer even when he knows it . The kid no one in their right mind would want to be friends with . " Across the table , tears start to well up in Chloe 's eyes , but I 'm not finished . " Do n't pretend you care . Because the second this frozen-in-time thing thaws , I 'll be nothing more than a minor smudge in your perfect high school memories . In fact , you should be happy for me . Because I 've finally gotten my wish . And now I see how dumb it was to begin with . " As much as I hate leaving the veal parmesan , I feel myself stand up and push my chair back . And just at this moment everything comes back to life . The restaurant fills with piano music and noise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're so busy celebrating I do n't think they even notice Chloe and me . With watery eyes she looks up and asks , " Where are you going ? " " You want to invite me back to Angie 's party ? " I ask . " I could , " she says . " Be honest , Chloe . Now that everything 's back to normal , you do n't want to . " Chloe lowers her gaze at the flickering candle in it 's little crystal bowl . Enough said . I 'm out of here . Through the door and down the street . Where am I going ? Home , where else .
