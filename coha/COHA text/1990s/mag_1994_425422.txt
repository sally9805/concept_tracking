He captured in ways no one else has how America <p> Nostalgic old-timers , romantic young couples , capering children , and ever-present , camera-wielding tourists  --  all can be found flocking daily to the new , classical revival-style , two-story building located near Stockbridge , Mass . Since opening its doors last spring , it has become a popular place of pilgrimage in the rolling Berkshire Hills of western Massachusetts . <p> From the very first day , to no one 's surprise , the Norman Rockwell Museum has been a box-office success . <p> In the famous Old Corner House at the corner of Main and Elm , where the museum planted its roots two decades ago , Norman Percival Rockwell 's art has repeatedly proved its long-established popular appeal . From before World War I to the 1970s , Rockwell ( born 100 years ago Feb. 3 ) drew and painted thousands of images that told the stories of Americans , many kinds , ages , and sizes  --  and the story of America as he saw it . <p> " Without thinking too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was showing the America I knew and observed to others who might not have noticed . " He pictured ordinary people and their daily lives : barbers and elementary school teachers , family doctors and plumbers , fishermen and baseball players , piano tuners and steeple clock repairmen . He portrayed lovable grandpas and grandmas , awkward teenagers and starry-eyed young lovers , All-American soldiers and sailors  --  and kids . Lots of them : shy , bossy , embarrassed , fidgety , cuddly , and full of mischief . Kids smiling and kids crying  --  and kids trying to grow up faster than allowed . <p> There was often a humorous twist to the story , but never a cruel put-down . There was celebration and good , clean fun , but no glitzy self-indulgence . Rockwell portrayed America as a place of friendly , helpful , caring neighbors : people who loved parades , Thanksgiving dinners , Santa Claus , poignant homecomings , and grace before meals . Most people think he got it right . <p> Critics say this proves people have an insatiable yearning for an America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land that is , as one put it , " long gone and , in truth , never was . " Art scholars , sociologists , professionals , and amateurs expressed such opinions about Rockwell 's popularity while he was still living  --  and sometimes added loftily that he really was n't a true , serious artist . Other artists and social scientists disagree . If nobody loved him but ordinary people , many surely did  --  and still do . He helped them smile and feel good about life . <p> Stockbridge did n't start out to create a museum for Norman Rockwell , its most famous citizen , but in the end it had to . In 1967 , one group of citizens concerned about the demolition of one of Main Street 's oldest houses organized to save the building . In 1969 , they turned the refurbished building into the Stockbridge Historical Society Museum . Rockwell and his wife , Molly , joined in the fund-raising drive and agreed to lend some of his paintings to the various artifacts collected over many years by the local library . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Old Corner House museum were n't there to gaze at the Stockbridge memorabilia . Word spread that this was the place to get a good retrospective of Rockwell 's paintings , drawings , posters , and Saturday Evening Post covers , as well as his most famous series , the Four Freedoms ( 1943 ) . <p> In 1973 , Rockwell turned over his personal art collection to the museum in trust ; three years later , he included his converted barn-studio and its contents . In 1978 he died . Year by year , attendance increased . By the end of its first decade , one thing had become clear : this was really " The Norman Rockwell Museum . " With the number of visitors moving beyond 100,000 a year ( and only one public toilet ! ) , the Old Comer House could n't cope with the crowds . <p> The 1980s brought intensive fund-raising , property acquisition , architectural planning  --  and lively community controversy . Some Stockbridge residents did n't want their museum to move out of the village . Some neighbors feared an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back country roads . Bitter arguments about zoning regulations erupted . After a thoroughly organized political campaign , a heavily attended town meeting , the largest on record , voted three-to-one in favor of a new museum location . <p> Linwood , the former Butler estate on State Route 183 , was the chosen site . Its stone manor house , built in 1859 in the grand Hudson River style for a New York lawyer , was one of the Berkshire Hills ' " summer cottages " dotting this beautiful upland region . The old house , screened from the new museum by a row of tall evergreens , has been restored and refurnished to serve as the museum 's administrative offices . Nearby stands Rockwell 's well-used red barn studio with its tall , north-light , glass wall , moved here from the center of Stockbridge village . His artist 's props , easels , brushes , supplies , and wall decorations are much as he left them . He might have just stepped down the street to the Red Lion Inn for a Thursday lunch with his cronies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 36-acre " campus " property is the gleaming white , new museum building . Reminiscent of a New England town hall , it faces a generous expanse of grass , suggesting the simple setting of a village green . Four modest wooden columns frame the entranceway . A cupola rises above the pitched roof lines at the center of the building , providing top lighting for the main gallery . Inside are a generous reception area , a giftshop-bookstore , and interconnecting galleries that exhibit nearly 150 of the roughly 500 Rockwell works owned by the museum . <p> Rockwell was highly productive . The two-volume , 1,200-page Norman Rockwell : A Definitive Catalogue , authored by museum director Laurie Norton Moffatt , lists his creative legacy  --  more than 4,000 original works . Many were commissioned by commercial and industrial firms for advertising and promotional purposes and later sold or given away to company executives . Several hundred items are in the hands of art dealers . Offered at auction , a good original brings anywhere between $150,000 and $300,000 . Despite the art world 's mostly disdainful treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Brooklyn Museum , the Corcoran Gallery , the Los Angeles County Museum of Art , the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum , and the National Portrait Gallery . <p> The Stockbridge collection , begun with items loaned and given by the Rockwell family , has increased with numerous additional gifts and bequests . The largest group of acquisitions , however , came through purchases financed by an endowment fund of about $2 million , mostly generated by the sale of artist 's proofs . Preserved by the latest techniques of climatic controls , the permanent collection grows as the museum receives more donations . <p> Even now , it is not possible ( or desirable ) to exhibit all the holdings at one time . Special shows are being planned around themes related to Rockwell 's evolving career and shifting interests . Some will become traveling exhibitions , shared with other museums . The first , scheduled this summer and fall , has been developed with the Delaware Art Museum of Wilmington . It also deals with the works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magazine illustrators . <p> The museum is currently presenting a far-ranging review of Rockwell 's life and work , some portions of which will be on permanent display . Chief among these is " My Adventures as an Illustrator " ( also the title of his autobiography ) , an exhibition of more than 60 paintings representative of Rockwell 's six-decade career and a variety of photographs and personal artifacts . Quotations from his writings , attractively placed , reveal the dimensions of his personality and mind . <p> Three connecting galleries house " From Idea to Illustration , " an exhibition depicting work processes Rockwell used to explore a possible project : rough pencil sketches , photos , charcoal drawings , color studies , and finished paintings . It provides an impressive lesson in the meticulous care Rockwell took to achieve his finely detailed effects . <p> The museum also gives special attention to his long association with The Saturday Evening Post . At age 22 , he made his first Post cover sale for the May 20 , 1916 , issue : " Two boys in baseball uniforms scoffing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pushing a baby carriage , " as Rockwell described it . On June 3 , the Post carded its second Rockwell cover . ( In his words : " A kids ' circus , one kid in long underwear as a strong man , another in a top hat as barker , others as spectators . " ) The Post paid $75 for each painting . During the following 12 months , young Rockwell sold five more cover pictures to the Post . His career was well-launched ; he was on his way to fame and fortune . <p> By his assessment , " The cover of the Post was the greatest show window in America for an illustrator . If you did a cover for the Post , you had arrived . " Another time , he wrote : " The Post meant a great deal to me ; it was the only outlet , really , for the kind of work I liked to do best . " <p> It is an exaggeration to say , as someone once did , that the Post made Norman Rockwell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rockwell and the Post did help each other . They shared the golden age of the general-interest magazine , before television and the flood of localized , regionalized , and specialized magazines drastically altered the periodical market . Both profited greatly from the association . During those years , Rockwell did 320 paintings for Post covers that established him as the top magazine illustrator of the world . They also made him a wealthy man . <p> In mid-World War II , The Saturday Evening Post provided the showcase for Rockwell 's most ambitious and noteworthy work : the four pictorial representations of President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's Four Freedoms : Freedom of Speech , Freedom of Worship , Freedom from Want , and Freedom from Fear . First offered to the U.S. Government without charge , the paintings were turned down by some middle-level bureaucrat who condescendingly told Rockwell , in effect , that they wanted the work done by a " first-rank artist . " On his way home from Washington , the scorned illustrator stopped off in Philadelphia to show his paintings to Ben Hibbs , editor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as covers but as featured illustrations , one a week , with accompanying essays by distinguished writers . <p> Reproduced by the millions , they became great patriotic sermons , raising vast sums in war bonds and strengthening popular support for the war effort . The New Yorker magazine wrote of them in April 1945 that they " were received by the public with more enthusiasm , perhaps , than any other paintings in the history of American art . " Today , they are a central attraction of the museum . <p> From early in his career , Rockwell 's happy , upbeat , naturalistic style ( plus his growing fame ) brought him countless commissions from major American corporations for illustrating calendars and advertisements . It was a blue-ribbon list of clients and products : Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance , Pan American World Airways , Chase Manhattan Bank , Campbell 's Soups , Interwoven Socks , Arrow Shirts , Goodyear Tires , Carnation Milk , Del Monte Foods , Paramount Pictures , General Motors , Ford , Chrysler  --  and many more . <p> He did commemorative stamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury Department , the military services , and Hollywood movies ; mail-order catalogues for Sears-Roebuck , Montgomery Ward , and Top Value Trading Stamps ; greeting cards for Hallmark ; and a huge Yankee Doodle mural for The Nassau Tavern in Princeton , N.J. Between 1912 and 1940 , he did illustrations for 43 books , including new printings of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn . Museum holdings also document these assignments . <p> Rockwell 's portraits of the notable figures of his day , usually done for magazine publication , became popular icons : Charles Lindbergh ; Presidents Eisenhower , Nixon , Kennedy , Johnson , and Reagan ( before his election ) ; other political figures , such as Barry Goldwater , Adlai Stevenson , Hubert Humphrey , Nelson Rockefeller , Bobby Kennedy , and George McGovern ; movie stars John Wayne , Gary Cooper , Bob Hope , and Ann-Margret ; three generations of the Henry Ford family ; and countless others . His John F. Kennedy painting was the only cover the Post ran twice ; it ran the second time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Rockwell has been commonly categorized as a " true " conservative , a patriot , an upholder of tradition , and an old-time , small-town enthusiast for apple pie , Morn , and baseball . He was all of those . Rockwell 's multifaceted works preserve and affirm the great strengths , moral purposes , social values , hopes , and dreams of Americans at their best . But he was no parochial , narrow-minded right-winger . A warm-hearted , caring human being , he knew about human suffering , social ills , and the need for responsible change . <p> His Freedom of Worship painting and another called Golden Rule make clear his sense of the unity and equality of all races and nationalities . Perhaps the museum 's most moving , dramatic work is an oil painting , reproduced in Look ( January 14 , 1964 ) , entitled The Problem We All Live With . It shows an African-American girl , school books in hand , solemnly marching in step with four sets of legs . The men 's faces are not shown , but their identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marshall . The message is even clearer about the school integration struggle in Selma , Alabama , and elsewhere . <p> Mostly , Rockwell let his art speak for him , but occasionally he made a speech or wrote something that gave fresh insight on the inner man . In a 1963 lecture , he said , " I am wildly excited about painting contemporary subjects-pictures about civil rights , astronauts , the Peace Corps , the poverty program . " Besides those subjects , he painted ordinary Russian people at the height of the Cold War , showing them as appealing human beings . He did a strikingly beautiful , but grim painting of Christmas in Bethlehem that subtly showed the tragic Israeli-Palestinian political and military confrontation even in the midst of holiday celebration . It has a prominent place in the Museum exhibit , as timely today as when he painted it more than two decades ago . <p> Nevertheless , one of the most self-revealing things he ever said was his reappraisal years later of his lavishly praised Four Freedoms . He thought he got Freedom of Speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical of the two other freedoms . Freedom from Want  --  a grandmother setting a great platter of roasted turkey on a dinner table surrounded by a well-fed family  --  came to represent something else : not freedom from want for starving millions around the world , but American " abundance , the table was so laded down with food , " he said . Likewise , the portrayal of Freedom from Fear  --  a lovely young mother tucking two lovely young children into a comfortable , big double bed  --  troubled him . As he thought about the children of Britain , who were then cringing in bomb shelters on whatever cots and pads were available , he believed he had given way to " a smug idea . " <p> Such honesty , compassion , and humanity in no way contradicts his evident love for America , small towns , friendly neighbors , and a rooted , traditional way of life . Robert A.M. Stern , the New York-based international architect who designed the museum , says he was determined to create an unpretentious building rooted in the small-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has done just that . <p> Speaking of the man and the artist , Stern says : " Rockwell 's art mirrors our world  --  or at least an ideal , slightly lost version of that world . . . . Mom and apple pie are very good institutions , and so was Rockwell 's America  --  despite the presumed shortcomings of its seeming simplifications . Rockwell was really a very fine artist . He captured in ways no one else has how America was , and how a large part of it wants to be . " <p> As you wander through the galleries examining the faces of visitors intently studying Norman Rockwell 's works , and watching them smile as they leave , you are thankful a man with such talents lived and painted as he did , leaving hopeful messages for young and old , and for generations yet to come . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : America is celebrating the 100th anniversary of Norman Rockwell 's birth , and his adopted hometown of Stockbridge , Massachusetts , is ready with a brand-new 38-acre museum complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrator . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Author Landrum Bolling joins other Rockwell admirers at the new Norman Rockwell Museum , located just outside the town of Stockbridge , Mass .
