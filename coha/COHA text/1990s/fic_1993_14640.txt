Scene : A dark , wide , open place . A strange MAN appears . Pause . He smiles , begins talking to us . FIRST MAN I am running on empty in a region infinitely &nbsp; &nbsp; sparse , infinitely many.Those there who are who do not donut &nbsp; &nbsp; as good as we used to was.We trample them down and yell &nbsp; &nbsp; in place of bellringing sure.We get up on our hindparts , hey , &nbsp; &nbsp; and exchange wigglies.We party monster-like till the &nbsp; &nbsp; moon fries our velvet shadows.Patience we do not much care for.We are of that other kind , the self-similar &nbsp; &nbsp; mailbox-mouthed.To prong donuts excited our wiggly &nbsp; &nbsp; forks.Why , you inquire , meaning no gas.Because the big end belongs to the &nbsp; &nbsp; North , and we are not nosey , nope.Because our breath is of stone , yup.Because we collect no dust on our &nbsp; &nbsp; hindparts by error 's somersault.We are both beastly and robust , &nbsp; &nbsp; upon the horned plains of the earth.Robust we are , and widely distributed , &nbsp; &nbsp; infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &nbsp; &nbsp; with terminal pissed-offedness.Our brambles are full of poisoned wigglies.Our minds move slow , but in wide &nbsp; &nbsp; circles.Nothing much hinders the sky thought &nbsp; &nbsp; on its lark , on its random lasso.So as far as we go , still &nbsp; &nbsp; we stop.As for stop a mop will do.Kill it and grow wigglies , especially &nbsp; &nbsp; the abject kind.Pray to the moose for restoration &nbsp; &nbsp; of hindpart sensation.Pray to the moose for mops , and stop &nbsp; &nbsp; signs to deter foreigners , &nbsp; &nbsp; fork lifts to deter grabity , storks &nbsp; &nbsp; to deter chimneys , stillness to &nbsp; &nbsp; deter noise , and noise to deter &nbsp; &nbsp; mooses , in particular the abject &nbsp; &nbsp; kind , sure.Things tend to stop.Things tend to start up , likeso.They tend to bend light &nbsp; &nbsp; till we who dwell in bent halls &nbsp; &nbsp; of bent mirrors get the bent message &nbsp; &nbsp; likeso and fall over , all bamboozled.The stop people have the start button &nbsp; &nbsp; to do the work of bottleneck.The other way works the same , except &nbsp; &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts , bent wigglies , &nbsp; &nbsp; extraneous moose noise and the whole &nbsp; &nbsp; damned abject monsterosity of killed &nbsp; &nbsp; feet , empty hearts and done-in brain &nbsp; &nbsp; power , railing against the whole darn &nbsp; &nbsp; whitewash of amateur washouts by &nbsp; &nbsp; professional doorstops , yesmen and &nbsp; &nbsp; loose women , yeah.I am galloping through a region of rusted &nbsp; &nbsp; jumbos , atomic glimmer glass , archaic &nbsp; &nbsp; rosebuds , mystic armadillos and &nbsp; &nbsp; borderline hayrakes looking for a &nbsp; &nbsp; few good men to catch them porkypines.I am walking slow through a world &nbsp; &nbsp; of glass gone haywire.I am walking slow on the sticky stuff &nbsp; &nbsp; of another man 's cellophane , sure.I am walking slow without no more &nbsp; &nbsp; bad thoughts than you would expect &nbsp; &nbsp; of one such as me , gone bananas &nbsp; &nbsp; on mystic glimmer gas , and &nbsp; &nbsp; whoop-de-doo ! For he who thinks otherwise I have &nbsp; &nbsp; prepared the cauldron of hot , &nbsp; &nbsp; boiling oil , just in case he do n't &nbsp; &nbsp; back off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a monster weirdo , or a &nbsp; &nbsp; social undesirable , or basket case , &nbsp; &nbsp; or one of them as wears jewelry , &nbsp; &nbsp; or a bone through the nose or a gold &nbsp; &nbsp; pin screwed through the nipple like &nbsp; &nbsp; I seen at the gym giving me the abject &nbsp; &nbsp; willies , so that I grew full strange , &nbsp; &nbsp; and wiggly.World 's full of people stuck on someone &nbsp; &nbsp; else 's cellophane.World 's full of places where your feet clink &nbsp; &nbsp; off the glimmer glass , where once long ago &nbsp; &nbsp; the earth hotted up ten million degrees , &nbsp; &nbsp; no shit , sure.As I am trudging through a Menger sponge , a &nbsp; &nbsp; solid black block of basaltic lord-knows-what , I find X in the name of Y and &nbsp; &nbsp; grow doilies.These are not the doilies I have a hankering &nbsp; &nbsp; for , therefore I do not like them , yup.Upon the oath I confirm box lunches.Upon both the oath and the breaking of it &nbsp; &nbsp; I implement oases and office checks.I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door Chubby uses , &nbsp; &nbsp; with both his oaths and tools , lie in &nbsp; &nbsp; wait humming the credo shit floats , &nbsp; &nbsp; boat my blues , dig up my old book &nbsp; &nbsp; of fake dreams , and think much upon &nbsp; &nbsp; the invisibility of Richard Stans , yup.I fear I am a black sheep barging through &nbsp; &nbsp; the back door , braying , into a blind &nbsp; &nbsp; alley leading to a black Ka'abah , where &nbsp; &nbsp; I 'm not supposed to go.I fear Ralph , even though he 's dead.I fear all the doilies , who are strange &nbsp; &nbsp; to me.Strange feet fear the same stuff , likeso.I go great guns upon the hangnail sarcophagus.Piles of spare wigglies arrive in mad crates &nbsp; &nbsp; infinitely sparse , looped and knotted.Grace 's a fear park of the rider people , &nbsp; &nbsp; and sheer destiny palls.Grace 's got the same strange feet I do , &nbsp; &nbsp; yet none fear her the way they do me.Strange , Grace.Strange to be an Ichabod Ka'abah.I prefer this to that for no reason.I prefer this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosed this , and not that , That one dwells in the forest of swill , all &nbsp; &nbsp; candles smeared with mystic nightshade ooze.That one 's a rider perilous , a double &nbsp; &nbsp; headed trouble-shooter , a ne'er-do-well &nbsp; &nbsp; who aced his fate and wears no icy halo.That one heaps me hot so , yup.This one bursts like grievous nightshade , opening.OO cats ' eyes glory in the opening up , yup.They air out the terror of the night , yup.But they irk me with their terrorist tendencies.For strange people are moving around &nbsp; &nbsp; inside of my house.Boing , they go . Boing.And once they are done with the boings &nbsp; &nbsp; commence booing and the booings &nbsp; &nbsp; are as bad as the boings and the &nbsp; &nbsp; boings having driven me half off &nbsp; &nbsp; my nut I begin to boo too so my voice 'll &nbsp; &nbsp; get lost in the booing and they will &nbsp; &nbsp; henceforth get lost and be gone and not &nbsp; &nbsp; notice I am here , alone , in my house &nbsp; &nbsp; and start all over again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boings which I hate.That is why I prefer this to that.OO cats ' eyes light up the fractal zone , sure.I am trudging slow in a region of Couette-Taylor &nbsp; &nbsp; flow and perpetual turnstiles , sure.Junk bats boat in the blue wind , ho.Hovering in deepest glide.Ralph there , dead.Buoyed in dead hope , gone cat.Dust in rills , another &nbsp; &nbsp; planet.We shift our errors , compounding &nbsp; &nbsp; the wilderness.Needlemen approach.They signal , holding up &nbsp; &nbsp; painted wigglies.Wind , wind and no water , yup.Boulders bunched up , yup.We consult the mystic oracle.We offer up mystic glimmer gas.We talk to our wide one , Chubby.Chubby tells us plenty , yup.We take their wigglies and kill &nbsp; &nbsp; the mothmen , sure.Junk bats boat in the blue wind , ho.We , we and them , them and the others , strange.Seasons cooled , cooked.I think about the whole damn enterprise.I ornament the region with unholy images &nbsp; &nbsp; of the directory tree.I put on someone 's clothes , not mine.The clothes cling to my human nakedness.I am ashamed .

&nbsp; so we smote the hexes and slew the shoats.Fudges of unknown slime succumbded to their &nbsp; &nbsp; baser instincts and was did elected , among &nbsp; &nbsp; us , kits to cats of senatorial cabbagery , sure.Sunken lore bellied up and dovetailed &nbsp; &nbsp; heartbreak.The nightseed grew a directory tree.Glimmers of gasses inflicted seismic &nbsp; &nbsp; opera upon the friends of good &nbsp; &nbsp; works who had gone belly up in fear &nbsp; &nbsp; of sunken lore and tragic glimmer gas.Dogs learned a nether lingo &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeble fellow.It was not am likesome.For I was there , and saw it , and liked &nbsp; &nbsp; not what I saw and was saw-milled &nbsp;

&nbsp; bric-a-brac and cast skinks.Grasses grow up and while away &nbsp; &nbsp; unexampled.Folded up wigglies rant on glimmer gas , &nbsp; &nbsp; pop out , darken the light source , fur &nbsp; &nbsp; the bald part , slow the fulsome vat of &nbsp; &nbsp; superheated cheese , stuff the poor folk &nbsp; &nbsp; with jars of dry rot ( furball puree ) , &nbsp; &nbsp; reverb the god woofer , bounce down the &nbsp; &nbsp; darkened staircase , turn over the cooling &nbsp; &nbsp; corpse to see if it 's rigid , dry the eyes &nbsp; &nbsp; of mystic Ahab ( Ahab , who shall return &nbsp; &nbsp; the third time as Richard Nixon ) , smother &nbsp; &nbsp; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and be borned again in mythic bric-a-brac.They , the ghostly android shuttle crew , emote on cue &nbsp; &nbsp; and smote shoats , half-crocked , and croak.They , the cheerful quasi-human redundant , &nbsp; &nbsp; grow buds on they directory trees.They take off glasses and see the mystic orgy &nbsp; &nbsp; of doomed impenitents , high on glimmer gas.They pop the dead back , and abdicate the &nbsp; &nbsp; next life for fear of this one , strange.They dark the deep of it , strange.They hang the neap tide , hey.They fashion devil grommets from demon &nbsp; &nbsp; mice , magnify contagion , dive-bomb &nbsp; &nbsp; the wicked in their old goon hotels , &nbsp; &nbsp; black hubs of badass bubble.They seek satiety , where I used to roam , &nbsp; &nbsp; one lone blur , with all my thousand &nbsp; &nbsp; furry feet , trailing my hideous gowns &nbsp; &nbsp; of funeral weed and bric-a-brac , sure.For I would investigate regions of niter &nbsp; &nbsp; with my wimple woven of star 's flesh &nbsp; &nbsp; and spiderlegs , kinda strange.And I would loosen the steel bands &nbsp; &nbsp; of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furry head to signify some horrid &nbsp; &nbsp; bio-theological paragogical bear trap , &nbsp; &nbsp; some ghastly parable implicating us all &nbsp; &nbsp; to the Cosmic Upstart himself , who shall &nbsp; &nbsp; rain down hot coals upon us , all in the &nbsp; &nbsp; name of Impious Misrule , cheese , and the &nbsp; &nbsp; cold mystic thrall of cosmic pitchblende.For I too was done up likeso.For I too roared and bellowed , rolled over &nbsp; &nbsp; and possum played , all to escape the &nbsp; &nbsp; horror , the horror of happening once &nbsp; &nbsp; too often to consider the human mythos &nbsp; &nbsp; ripe , as it truly is , in fairest form , all &nbsp; &nbsp; of a fine autumn eve , on a full stomach.I too was strong enough to run off , hiccoughing.I too was strong enough to stay.I too grew strange the more I thought upon it.Junk bats boat in the blue wind , ho.Hovering in deepest glide.Ralph there , dead.Buoyed in dead hope , gone cat.Dust in rills , another &nbsp; &nbsp; planet.We shift our errors , compounding &nbsp; &nbsp; the wilderness.Needlemen approach.They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no water , yup.Boulders bunched up , yup.We consult the mystic oracle.We offer up mystic glimmer gas.We talk to our wide one , Chubby.Chubby tells us plenty , yup.We take their wigglies and kill &nbsp;
