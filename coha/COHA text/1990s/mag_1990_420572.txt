Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS Both parties declared victory  --  and then pored over the election results to see what went wrong <p> Before the polls even opened , presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater  --  the nation 's spin doctor in chief  --  puckishly admitted that the White House would declare a GOP triumph no matter what . Sure enough , Washington strategists were busily snatching victory from the jaws of defeat last week . GOP leaders boasted of inroads into Democratic strongholds , Republican National Committee spokesman Charles Black managed to keep astraight face when he crowed , " It 's our best midterm election in decades . " Not to be outdone , Democratic National Committee Chairman Ronald Brown declared the ballot " a no-confidence vote " for George Bush , cutting off the president 's coattails once and for all . It was , in other words , business as usual among the revisionists on the Potomac . <p> In truth , the results were so mixed that both parties had reason to worry . Despite predictions of an insurgency at the polls voters returned 96 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of key figures unexpectedly slim margins : popular two-term Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey nearly lost to an unknown challenger , and Minority Whip Newt Gingrich almost found himself on a midnight train to Georgia  --  without a job . The Democrats cemented their hold over Congress with a probable gain of eight House seats  --  not enough to override a presidential veto but more than enough to make the White House squirm  --  and solidified their place in the sun , taking the Florida and Texas statehouses . But the GOP won the big one  --  California  --  and made serious inroads throughout the rust belt . Overall , the Democrats will be well situated to expand their congressional majorities when state legislatures begin redistricting next year . <p> No one felt greater pressure to draw lessons from the results than Bush , since the vote was clearly a referendum on him , too . Two days after the elections , he invited several of his closest outside advisers to an East Wing lunch . His first question : " Where can I improve ? " ( Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tongue since the chief of staff was also present . ) Bush also announced a new no-tax pledge , saying that next time Democrats would have to raise income tax rates " over my dead veto . " Congressmen too , will probably take last week 's close calls as a mandate for cowardice : running scared , they are less likely than ever to step out in front of difficult issues , or to reform a process that protects their seats . But there are risks in playing safe . " Americans are very angry and cynical about the system , " says GOP pollster Richard Wirthlin . " They think government is simply not governing . " <p> So what do voters want ? The key matters turned out to be pocketbook and personality . Politicians who want to survive the next round might consider listening to the following messages from the folks back home . Read Our Lips : The voters " certainly were out to punish people who participated in tax increases , " says GOP analyst Jeffrey Bell . Several governors lost after raising taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nebraska and Mike Hayden of Kansas vowed not to raise them , did anyway and paid with their jobs . Voters furious at New Jersey Gov . James Florio , who put in place a soak-the-rich tax plan , took it out on his fellow Democrat Bill Bradley . " I had people come up to me many , many times and say , ' I like you , but I 'm voting against you to send a message ' , " Bradley told NEWSWEEK last week . At the same time , voters in Massachusetts and several other states rejected tax-rollback measures which they perceived as too radical and too likely to cut into basic services . Shut Up , Already : Until a few weeks before the election , Boston University president John Silber seemed headed for the statehouse . Voters who were angry over the Massachusetts miracle turned mess were attracted at first by his white-hot rhetoric . But he lost his temper a few too many times and zinged a final " Silber shocker "  --  the suggestion that working mothers were responsible for child neglect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former U.S. assistant attorney general . In Texas , there was enough verbal mud on both sides to fill the Astrodome , but the " CC Factor , " or " Cumulative Claytie Factor , " ultimately accounted for Democrat Ann Richards 's victory over Clayton Williams . He had survived a series of gaffes , including a rape joke and questions about the sobriety of his rival , a recovering alcoholic . But Williams 's refusal to shake Richards 's hand in Dallas last month was a fatal miscalculation of Texas mores . Says Republican pollster Bryan Eppstein of Ft . Worth : It was " not gentlemanly . " Phone Home : Like nagging moms , voters in several states nudged their wayward sons to visit more often and stop being such big shots . New York Gov . Mario Cuomo , who won a less than convincing victory against a field of nobodies , may have some fence mending ahead of him . " We did n't get that exultant shout that we wanted to hear from the people , " he admitted afterward . Bradley , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , fervently promised the people to serve out his hard won third term . And conservative GOP firebrand Newt Gingrich , who obviously forgot Thomas P. ( Tip ) O'Neill 's axiom that " all politics are local , " also found the natives restless . " People here want a nice Georgia congressman who will care about their sewer , " says Kate Head , campaign manager for challenger David Worley , who has demanded a recount . By contrast , Democrats Lawton Chiles , who won Florida 's gubernatorial race , and Paul Wellstone , Minnesota 's new senator , ran highly effective grass-roots campaigns . Race Still Matters : North Carolina Sen. Jesse Helms 's defeat of Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt conveyed a disturbing message : if a candidate wants to play the race card , there are plenty of people who will want a seat at the table . Two weeks before the election , the three-term incumbent was nearly 8 points down in the polls . Then he aired emotionally charged TV ads that accused Gantt of supporting racial quotas . The ads helped draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , enough to give Helms a commanding lead . Though Bush helped Helms , GOP spin doctors focused instead on the congressional victory of Republican Gary Franks-a black millionaire from Connecticut who backed the president 's veto of the 1990 civil-rights bill . Flipping Will Flop : Abortion was n't the litmus test politicians were expecting . Although both sides could rightly claim gains , it was slightly more advantageous to be pro-choice . The worst thing for a candidate , however , was flip-flopping on the issue . In Ohio , state Attorney General Anthony Celebrezze destroyed his chances of becoming governor with a conversion to pro-choice . " He should have resigned the next day because the George Voinovich people just ate that all , " says one Democratic activist . Republican Voinovich won with 55 percent of the women 's vote . Seeing Red Over Green : All across the land environmental proposals came a cropper . Voters apparently support such measures only if they do n't cost money or jobs . Dianne Feinstein lost the California Statehouse to Republican Sen. Pete Wilson partly on account of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cuomo interpreted the defeat of his pet environmental bond issue as a sign of voter disgust with spending rather than as a " ' no ' to making the place cleaner and greener . " <p> Mostly , though , voters were feeling meaner . In California and Colorado , they showed what they thought of the status quo bypassing initiatives to limit terms of elected officials ; with Oklahoma , that makes three states . GOP consultant Eddie Mahe believes similar measures will be on the ballots of 12 to 15 more in 1992 . In California , legislators spent $4 million trying to convince voters that the term-limitation measure was nothing but a cheap political ploy . Speaker of the Assembly Willie Brown complained , " They 're trying to short-circuit my career . " As more and more legislators are likely to learn , that 's precisely the point . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Mixed messages from the folks back home : ( Clockwise from above ) Governor-elect Wilson of California , gubernatorial winner Richard of Texas , Senator Helms of North Carolina and Florida 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MCDANIEL and THOMAS M.
