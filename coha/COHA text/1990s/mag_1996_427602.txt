Section : Business &; technology The defense industry is being whittled down to just a few Top Guns <p> In the incredible shrinking defense industry , the dictum nowadays is get bigger or get out . The dramatic reduction of the Pentagon 's procurement budget since the end of the cold war has generated a spate of megamergers and spinoffs that are creating a few Top Guns like Lockheed Martin and Boeing . " Today , a defense company must possess scale even to survive , let alone earn superior returns , " states a new research report from Morgan Stanley , the blue-chip Wall Street investment firm . <p> One upshot is that well-known contractors , lacking critical mass , are choosing to focus on commercial opportunities and are exiting the defense business entirely . Next week , for example , Rockwell International , the nation 's 14th biggest defense contractor , will ask its shareholders to approve the sale of its defense and aerospace units to Boeing for $3.2 billion . Rockwell , which will be virtually debt free after the sale , will use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semiconductor and automotive businesses . Semiconductor maker Texas Instruments ( TI ) , which is also the No. 22 contractor , recently put its defense business up for sale . And there 's talk that TRW will soon do the same . <p> Meanwhile , Boeing , best known as the world 's leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft , is also aiming to become the Pentagon 's biggest aerospace supplier . The company moved closer to that goal when the Pentagon recently designated it one of two surviving finalists  --  along with Lockheed  --  for a $200 billion-plus project that has been dubbed the " contract of the century . " <p> Vanishing jobs . The upheaval in the U.S. defense industry is likely to send even more shock waves through the nation 's economy as plants , which currently employ 2.1 million people , are closed and consolidated as part of a massive streamlining effort . Tens of thousands of jobs , in places as far-flung as California and New England , could be at stake . <p> But some defense experts worry that the continuing shakeout could eventually alter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppliers . If just a few huge contractors emerge , as now seems likely , there 's fear they will have greater power to negotiate higher prices with the Pentagon , which might undercut the government 's ability to continue paring defense spending . <p> The Pentagon 's narrowing of what had been a three-way race to build the joint strike fighter ( JSF )  --  a single-design plane for the U.S. Army , Air Force and Marines as well as the British military  --  seems to be driving the consolidation craze to a climax . " There are n't too many billion-dollar defense deals left to do , " notes Mark Biagetti , a vice president with First Equity , a Connecticut-based investment banking firm that specializes in defense companies . <p> The few that remain could be blockbusters . McDonnell Douglas , the third competitor and big loser in the intense joint strike fighter face-off , is at a crossroads . The company recently put on hold the development of a new commercial jet . Now , having come up empty on the joint strike fighter and also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aerospace business , Harry Stonecipher , the company chairman and CEO , indicated last week . The St. Louis-based aerospace company is expected to bid for TI 's defense business . <p> Other , bolder moves may be afoot . Industry insiders speculate that Boeing , which held talks with McDonnell earlier in 1996 , may resume attempts to merge with its St. Louis competitor in order to improve its chances against Lockheed in thenext stage of the JSF contest . A marriage between McDonnell and Northrop Grumman was also being bruited about . <p> Reports last week that Raytheon  --  which last year purchased E-Systems , the crown jewel of defense electronics firms  --  was holding merger talks with Hughes Electronics , currently owned by General Motors , caused the stocks of both companies to rise on Wall Street . Paradoxically , investors in defense stocks have done far better since the Pentagon started forcing military contractors to be more cost-conscious ; investors have responded favorably to the wave of mergers and acquisitions , which has made the companies not only more efficient but also more profitable . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided for another four years , are enormous . " It 's like going to Coke and Pepsi and having them enter a winner-take-all competition for the cola market , " says Lockheed Martin Vice Chairman Norman Augustine . <p> Lockheed itself has been the main driving force in the consolidation of the industry . As the former chairman of Martin Marietta , Augustine played a key role in the merger between his company and Lockheed in 1993 . He also took part in the subsequent purchase , earlier this year , of Loral , creating what is by far the world 's biggest defense company , accounting for about a quarter of the Pentagon 's annual procurement budget of around $50 billion . <p> Today , Lockheed 's $30 billion in annual revenues almost equals the entire defense budget of the United Kingdom , or the sum of all defense spending in Africa and South America combined . Indeed , the joke going around Washington these days is that Lockheed 's next merger will be with the Air Force . " We have three auto companies and we may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " notes Larry Korb , formerly a Defense Department official in the Bush administration and now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington , D.C. Lockheed 's Augustine thinks the consolidation is healthy . " It 's better to have two strong companies than 10 inefficient ones , " he says . He notes that Lockheed has also been able to save $2.6 billion every year from downsizing and consolidation . But there is a cost : Last week , the company announced that it was closing eight plants and laying off 1,600 workers as part of the rationalization that resulted from the merger with Loral earlier this year . <p> European scene . The shakeout in the defense industry is taking place not here but abroad . The largest market for U.S. weapons systems  --  Europe  --  is undergoing its own bloodletting . The Europeans are only just beginning to rationalize their hodgepodge of defense companies . At September 's Farnborough Air Show outside London , the chairman of British Aerospace predicted that by the year 2000 Europe would wind up with two world-class defense contractors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wo n't be easy . Many European governments regard their defense firms as key security assets and would prefer to support these " national champions " rather than let them go out of business . <p> But patience on that front is wearing thin . Earlier this year , Fokker Aircraft , the pride of the Dutch aerospace industry , was allowed to go out of business when the government of the Netherlands refused to bail out the 84-year-old aircraft manufacturer . Recently , Samsung , a South Korean conglomerate , has expressed interest in buying the remains of Fokker . <p> Back in the United States , the defense industry may soon lose its best friend in Washington . Defense Secretary William Perry , who has overseen the rationalization of the military industrial complex and is a strong advocate for cost-effective procurement policies , is expected to leave the Clinton administration . " Perry has been the good shepherd over the downsizing of the defense industry , " says Wolfgang Demisch , who follows the defense companies for BT Securities . Whoever succeeds him faces a daunting task : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the face of growing budget pressures and calls for still more savings from the Pentagon . If a Perryless Defense Department is n't careful , it could find that its days of getting more bang for the taxpayer 's buck are numbered .
