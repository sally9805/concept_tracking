BEYOND MOTHERHOOD By Jill Barker Back to Basics Workout A busy mom starts her workout early in the morning and continues until the day is done . Carrying babies , lifting toddlers and lugging groceries can force fragile back muscles to work overtime . It 's no wonder that when the sun goes down and the kids are in bed ( hopefully ) , many moms complain of back pain . With a little education and awareness , however , most back pain can be prevented . The abdominals , the erector spinae ( upper and lower back muscles ) and the obliques ( the muscles that run along the side of the torso ) support and protect the spinal column . Keeping these muscles strong yet flexible will help you maintain good posture , and make everyday activities easier to do . Be sure to start your workout with a warm - up , like marching on the spot for a few minutes . The stretching exercises should be held for up to 30 seconds and repeated three times each while the strengthening exercises should be repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working slowly and with control . STRETCHING EXERCISES Spine Stretch MUSCLES USED upper back STARTING POSITION Sit on the floor with your right leg extended in front of your body . Bend your left knee and place your left foot flat on the floor on the far side of the right knee . ACTION Rotate your torso to the left and reach behind your body with your hands . Look over your left shoulder , keeping the upper body tall . Return to the starting position , then repeat in the opposite direction . Lower Trunk Rotation MUSCLES USED middle and lower back STARTING POSITION Lie on your back , lift your feet off the floor and raise your knees until they are directly over your hips . ACTION Rotate your knees to one side as far as feels comfortable . Hold for ten seconds . Slowly bring both knees up and repeat on the other side . Mad Cat MUSCLES USED upper , middle and lower back STARTING POSITION Position yourself on your hands and knees . ACTION Slowly lower your hips and seat until you are resting on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the body . Then lift your hips while rounding your back up as high as possible . Your head will slowly drop forward ( until you feel a nice stretch in the neck ) . Hold for five seconds . Now , starting with the last vertebra in your lower back , slowly tilt the pelvis towards the floor and let the spine stretch out into a U - shaped arch . When you have reached the maximum possible arch , slowly lift your head so your eyes are looking straight ahead and you are back to your starting position . STRENGTHENING EXERCISES Pelvic Clock MUSCLES USED abdominals and lower back STARTING POSITION Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat . ACTION Imagine the face of a clock resting flat on your pelvis . Begin by pressing your lower back to the floor and tilting your pelvis forward so that your pubic bone is pointing toward 12 o'clock . Now arching your back , tilt your pelvis in the opposite direction ( six o'clock ) . Using your abdominal and buttock muscles ( do n't push with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers on your imaginary clock . Lateral Curl MUSCLES USED obliques ( side of the trunk ) STARTING POSITION Lie on your side with a rolled towel or small pillow under your waist . Flex the knee of your bottom leg and place the foot on the floor behind you . This will help stabilize the pelvis . Bend the elbow of your top arm and place your fingers behind your ear . ACTION Gently lift the upper body , bringing the rib cage closer to the pelvis . This is a very small movement , so do n't be concerned if you can only lift your upper body a couple of inches off the floor . Hold for four seconds and slowly return to the starting position . Back Extension MUSCLES USED middle and lower back STARTING POSITION Lie face down , bend your elbows and place your fingertips just behind your ears . ACTION Slowly lift your chest and shoulders about six inches off the floor . Keep your eyes looking at the floor and your head in line with your spine . Hold , taking care not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulders ( do n't let elbows come forward ) , so that your chest gets a stretch as well . AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION ... When reaching down to pick your baby up , bend from the knees , not the back . Straddle the baby and pick her up keeping her close to your body . Use your legs to lift  --  feel them tighten as you return to a standing position . Lifting your toddler in and out of the car seat can place undue strain on your back . Again , let your legs do the heavy work and keep the child close to your chest until you are ready to place him in his seat . Pay close attention to the pivoting motion that is needed to manoeuvre your child in and out of the car . Refrain from rotating at the waist . Turn the hips and feet first , then allow the upper body to follow . Adjust the handle of your stroller to about waist height . If too high , your shoulders will be constantly lifted ; if too low , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back muscles . Bending over the tub while bathing a baby puts tremendous strain on the back . Make bathing easier by tucking yourself and your baby close to the side of the tub  --  the less you need to reach , the better . If your back is already tired or sore , try getting in the bath with your child instead . When carrying your child , change the position of the baby often . Try to keep your torso stable while supporting the weight of the baby with your arms . Refrain from letting your hip dip down or allowing your pelvis to swing forward or backward .
