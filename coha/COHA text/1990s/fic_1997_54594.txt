Rimrunner six touched down softly as a snowflake on a cat 's back . The lock-jockeys and groundbugs took less than a minute to scramble back to cover , then the port swung out and Vanderhorst started down the ramp . Lights were everywhere . Off to his left , a picket ship in a trim new design was poised on her ring , vehicles darting about in her shadow like ants around a fencepost . Vanderhorst liked the look of her , but he could spare the ship no more than a glance . All his attention was on getting down the ramp and into POP Headquarters without stumbling . Downside gravity had him feeling like a drunken elephant on greased glass . It made no difference to him that there was no one to see him fall . <p> That was the standing rule : no one sees a rimrunner until he 's been to POP for debriefing . Other rules changed , but that one appeared to have remained . <p> Vanderhorst hated debriefings . They were foolish and unnecessary and long . POP ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lock-in , but they wanted a verbal account , even though Vanderhorst had nothing to report from this trip but his dreams . <p> He wondered if anyone in POP actually expected a human to spot something the instruments had missed . Each time back , heading for debriefing , Vanderhorst fantasized about reporting something twice the size of the big rock of ' 06 heading straight for Washington . But he could not hope to get away with a trick like that . The instruments knew better . Even joking about it could cost his job , and he was not ready to give up rimrunning . <p> Doors loomed before him bearing the interlaced silver rings of the Perimeter Orbiting Patrol . He walked on without pausing and they purred apart to admit him . He passed through three more sets of doors and arrived at last in the debriefing room . Steadier on his feet now , but tired by the walk , he settled heavily in the oversized soft chair that awaited . <p> The room was dull white , illuminated in such a way as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed himself to relax a little . <p> When the debriefer entered , Vanderhorst raised a hand in greeting and remained seated . He studied the newcomer . The man looked like the father of someone he knew . <p> " Remember me , Van ? " <p> He had to think for a moment . " Bob Watts ? " <p> " That 's right . Last time you saw me , I was n't even showing a gray hair . " <p> " It 's only twenty-one months ago for me . How long have I been out Earthtime ? " <p> " Nineteen years , five months , twenty-four days . Your health reads perfect , Van . You can skip the medics , if you like . " <p> " I 'll skip them . " <p> " We have a new model picket ship . She 's on North Ring Four . " <p> " I had a quick look at her . " <p> " She 's a beauty , Van . Roomier than Six , and about one-third Earth gravity shipboard . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sleep ? " <p> " Wait till you see , Van . She 's got a new type of  --  " <p> " Hold all that , " Vanderhorst broke in . " Right now , I want to get this over with and see what the world looks like this time around . " <p> Watts raised a hand . " Anything you say , Van . Unless you have something unusual to report , you can go direct to Reacculturation . " <p> " No formal debriefing ? " <p> " Not for the last fourteen years . No point to them . " <p> " I told the smart boys that sixty years ago , " Vanderhorst said . " Any other changes I should know about ? " <p> " Nothing major . Reacculturation can tell you better than I can . " <p> " You tell me . If I 've come back to trouble , I want to know . " <p> " Nothing serious , Van . You 've seen it all before . POP is n't the people 's favorite these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Did something get by ? " <p> " Nothing gets by POP . It 's the old problems : money and politics . That new model cost ninety-four billion . It 's one of four . Some people say that 's too expensive . " <p> " Asteroid hits are expensive , too , " Vanderhorst said . " The one in ' 06 cost a couple of trillion , and that one landed in the ocean . What if the next one knocks California into the Pacific ? " <p> " That 's what we tell them , Van . But ' 06 was eighty years ago for downsiders . No one remembers it . " <p> " Do they remember the ones we took out before they hit ? " <p> Watts shook his head . " Nobody remembers what did n't happen , Van . " <p> " So now there 's talk of cutting the program . Is that it ? " <p> " Not from anyone who matters . " <p> " Sometimes you do n't know who matters until it 's too late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up a high-probable on this run , and we 'll use that against the jokers who tell people that the odds against another big hit are a million to one . The program is safe . " <p> Vanderhorst pushed himself up out of the chair . For an instant he was unsteady . Watts started to assist him , but checked himself . <p> " I 'm doing just fine , Bob , " Vanderhorst said . " Is Reacculturation in the same place as before ? " <p> Watts nodded . " Second door on the left . Good to have you back , Van . " <p> This was the best debriefing yet . Watts had kept it short and spoken straight . Vanderhorst detested the assault of carefully researched obsolete terms that some POP staffers memorized to put rimrunners at their ease . The artificial speech was nothing more than a buffer , placing the staffers at a safe remove from real contact . <p> Was it insensitivity , he wondered , or ignorance ? Was it fear ? Perhaps none of the downsiders in POP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there alone , ringing the solar system at half of lightspeed on a sixty-billion-mile circuit ; or what it was like to come back to new words , new ideas , a new society on each return and never know what the reception was going to be . <p> Cutback talk was nothing new . On Vanderhorst 's first return , there had been riots and an attack on the launch complex , but all that frenzy had passed with recovery from the depression of 2028 . When he came back for the second time , in ' 48 , all was calm . The last time back , in ' 67 , rimrunners were folk heroes . He had been on the hollies every night for two weeks running . All three major parties had approached him to stand for office in the ' 68 elections . <p> If he had stayed downside that last time , he would now be almost as old as Watts . No , correct that . He would look almost as old . In fact he would be much older . That was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a score of years to his two . It made all the differences manifest and undeniable . Rimrunners cheated time and clocks and calendars , those universal tyrants : that was what people thought , and why everyone envied them , and some resented them , and a few hated them , despite the surface show of admiration . But the price of those stolen years was high , and few could pay it . One rimrunner out of a hundred did a second circuit . So far , only Vanderhorst had returned for a third and a fourth . <p> Even in the stasis tank , isolation was a palpable presence . Careful screening training , and conditioning all helped make it more bearable , but it was always there , enclosing a man like his own skin . It did things to people . <p> When he passed through the last door , Vanderhorst stopped and looked around in mild surprise . Reacculturation had a different look . The impersonal office he recalled from his last visit had been turned into a comfortable homelike setting of the kind he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh air , curtains blowing in a gentle breeze , doors all standing ajar ; nothing here to confine him . A young couple , slim and clean-featured , both of them smiling in welcome , rose from chairs to greet him . <p> " Welcome back , Captain Vanderhorst . It 's an honor to have you here , " the man said , extending a hand . " I 'm Korry Long . " <p> " I 'm Jemma Tulio , " the woman said . <p> " Jemma and I are a registered couple . We 're under a two-year option agreement , " Korry said . " I daresay that does n't mean much to you , Captain . " <p> " Not a thing . " <p> Jemma took Vanderhorst 's hand and led him to a chair . " There 's been considerable change in the structuring of social relations . That 's probably the most significant alteration in the cultural pattern since your departure , so we thought we 'd begin your reacculturation with that aspect . " <p> The chair was set out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on both sides . Vanderhorst seated himself gingerly . " Is this reacculturation ? No more talkdowns ? No cramming ? " <p> " This is the talkdown . Sleep-cram will be administered only when you feel ready , " she said . <p> " So we just sit here and chat ? " <p> " Exactly . We find that it facilitates reintegration . " <p> " Choppy down with me , runklers , " Vanderhorst said , folding his hands behind his head . When they both turned vague , cautious smiles on him , he said , " Sorry . That 's from before your time . I thought you 'd have the old expressions down pat . " <p> " We avoid conscious anachronisms now , Captain , " Korry said . <p> " Call me Van . And tell me more about social relations . " <p> " There 's been a strong resurgence of traditional attitudes in the last fifteen years . Apparently things were quite uninhibited when you were home last . " <p> " You make it sound as if I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't offended  --  " <p> " Never mind . Yes , things were uninhibited , " Vanderhorst said , smiling faintly , remembering the days of anything anyone wanted , anywhere , anytime , with anyone at all , until there was nothing left to want . The 2060s had been prosperous years , and people had lived them to the burnt-out end . <p> " So we 've heard . It 's different now . " <p> " I expected something like that . How different are they ? " <p> Jemma responded . " Many things that were acceptable during your last stay downside are now under social sanction . " <p> Her explanation was unnecessary . The information was there for Vanderhorst to see . Jemma was pretty , and doing her best to conceal it . Makeup that gave her a sallow coloration , close-cropped hair , a dingy sack of a dress that concealed her figure : here were the signs that he had come back to leaner times . He recalled the depression years of his first return . No wonder the people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want rimrunners , they want bread and circuses and sex . It 's all they ever wanted . <p> " What 's legal these days ? " he asked . <p> " The government has n't made life impossible , Van , " Korry began with a show of joviality . " Times may be less free-wheeling , but  --  " <p> " Stop hedging . I 've just spent nearly two years in space . I may want company once I 've settled in , and I do n't want to be arrested for saying ' Hello ' to a woman . " <p> Jemma laid her hand on his . " The government recognizes special circumstances , Van . " <p> Vanderhorst looked from one to the other , then laughed . They did not join in . Still grinning , he said , " The new morality sounds like old-fashioned scodding around , only with government approval . " <p> Jemma looked uncomfortable , " It 's a very special privilege , Van . " <p> He raised a conciliatory hand . " I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> They went on , speaking in turn , a well-rehearsed routine , and Vanderhorst listened with a solemn look on his sharp features . He nodded weightily from time to time to demonstrate attention , but his mind was only half on their words . They had little to teach him . <p> Vanderhorst had passed his youth in the shrill and angry years that bracketed the millennium , a time when half the world looked to the turn of the century as an end and the other half saw it as a beginning . Those who proclaimed Armageddon felt that their prophecy was fulfilled , albeit belatedly , when in 2006 a giant meteorite plunged into the Indian Ocean . <p> For Vanderhorst , the calamity meant deliverance . Within months the Perimeter Orbiting Patrol had been organized . Staffed and supported by most of the nations of the world , its mission was to serve as first line of defense : to detect and destroy any incoming object that threatened Earth or the lunar colonies . Its budget was unlimited . <p> Volunteers were many ; the qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered the honor of being a " defender of the farthest frontier , " as its promoters said . It also promised an extended lifespan and a chance to amass enormous wealth . To Vanderhorst , it afforded escape from the daily round of hardship and indignity compounded by growing hatred for the generations that had left their children a drained and dirty world to live on . He knew that regeneration would come , but no one then alive could hope to see it  --  except by cheating time . <p> POP offered the cheater . In return , it required two years of one 's life , nearly twenty of objective time , spent farther out in space than any human had ever ventured ; alone , encapsulated , beyond all hope of help from Earth , beyond all contact with one 's native world . <p> Vanderhorst considered it a fair exchange . An only child , orphaned while young , instinctively mistrustful of groups and more independent than was socially permissible , he seemed the ideal rimrunner : a loner by nature and by choice . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He returned to Earth in 2028 with vague memories of smothering blackness ; of hideous nightmares , of helplessness crushing him like a weight . Nothing was clear in his memory but the sensation of being utterly alone . He vowed never to go up again . <p> After three months downside , he reconsidered his vow . Four more trips and he could retire , an immensely rich man still physically in his thirties , though Earth calculations would make him more than a century and a quarter old . He debated , weighed the alternatives , changed his mind half a dozen times , and then went up again . <p> " Are you listening , Van ? " Jemma 's voice broke into his reverie . <p> " It sounds as if I can be arrested for doing anything that looks like I might enjoy it . " <p> " No one 's arrested anymore , Van . Offenders are offered social assistance . " <p> " Offered ? Then that means I can turn it down , does n't it ? " They looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that remark . Just run a summary of behavior expectations into my cram . It 's simpler that way , " he said , yawning . " Put the update on POP status with government and public on the cram , too . I want all that clear in my mind by morning . " <p> " Are you sure you do n't want to talk any longer ? Personal contact is an important part of reacculturation , " Korry said . <p> " So is sleep . I 've been awake for most of the last three days . And I have n't weighed a hundred kilos for a long time . " <p> " If you 'd like companionship , Van , we 're authorized ... " Jemma smiled and let her voice trail into silence . <p> " Wo n't I need a permit ? " Vanderhorst said , rising . " Thanks for the kind offer , but I 'll take care of my personal relations all by myself . " <p> He left them with a definite feeling that there were a great many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like . <p> He awoke to bright sunlight , his head bursting with information . The integration of old and new was , as always , a confusing process . He felt blurry and out of focus . Shutting his eyes tightly , he turned to the darker wall . After a time , he rolled over on his back and propped himself on his elbows . He yawned luxuriously and looked over the room . Like the Reacculturation Office , it was a turn of the century setting . They were bringing him down gently this time . <p> He swung his legs over the side of the bed and rose cautiously . He felt more at ease with normal gravity now than he had upon landing . <p> The apartment had a shower with a strong flow . The water was clear and free of the stale reek of shipboard water . As he dried in the heat bay , soft notes announced a call . He switched on the speaker . <p> " Did you enjoy the shower , Van ? We tried to get one like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " You do n't have to recreate the world of my youth for me , Jemma . I can adjust . I 've done it before . " <p> " We 're only trying to make things as easy as we can . " <p> " How about just letting me alone ? I 'm as updated as I want to be . " <p> " You have press conferences today . " <p> " They 're never a problem . All I do is read the script POP has written for me . " <p> " Tomorrow you meet with your financial advisors . It may take some time . Your investments have grown complicated over the years . " <p> " Anything else ? " <p> " There 's a party . " <p> " If I want a party , I 'll throw my own . " <p> " This is important , Van , for you and for the program . Government people will be there . They 're interested in meeting you . " <p> " I 'm not interested in meeting them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When he did not respond , Jemma went on , " Other people will be there , too . You 'll enjoy it . And after that you 'll be on leave . No more interruptions . " <p> The formal attire of this time was simple in cut and subdued in color . In full dress uniform , Vanderhorst was the instantaneous center of attention when he , Jemma , and Korry entered . <p> " That 's Senator Dalton . She 's Chairman of the Space Ops Committee , " Korry said . <p> Vanderhorst followed Korry 's sightline and saw a tall , slim woman with silver hair standing with a younger man and a woman . As soon as Dalton noticed them she raised a hand in greeting . Korry steered Vanderhorst toward the threesome . <p> " It 's good of you to come , Captain Vanderhorst , " Dalton said . " This is Doree and Jake Fosset . Jake is my senior advisor . I must say , we 're all proud of the rimrunners . You 're brave people doing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for it . " <p> " There 's more to it than the pay , Captain . I 'm sure of that . " <p> " I think mostly about the pay , " Vanderhorst said , edging around so that his back was to the window . He glanced at Korry , who appeared ready to burst into tears . Jemma forced a smile . <p> Dalton said , " You 're an honest man , Captain . Whatever POP offered , you 'd never get me to circle the solar system for a twenty-year hitch . " <p> " It does n't feel like twenty . Does n't feel like much of anything , to tell the truth . " <p> " You spend most of your time sleeping , is n't that right ? There are people who accuse us in Washington of doing much the same . " <p> " I get my rest , Senator . " <p> " From what I 've read , you were born a century ago . You certainly do n't look a century old . " <p> Vanderhorst emptied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Dalton burst into laughter . " You say exactly what you think , Captain . I admire that . " <p> " Good , " Vanderhorst said . His expression did not change . He felt the crowd pressing in on him , and stepped back to distance himself . His jaw was set tight . <p> " Tell me , Captain , is it difficult out there ? " Doree Fosset asked . <p> " Is what difficult ? " <p> " The work . The mission . " <p> " Easiest job I ever had . The machines do all the work . Even the thinking . " <p> " I did n't mean difficult in that sense . I was thinking of the isolation . It must be terrible . All that time , and so far from home . Confined in a small space , no outlet . ... " Doree looked at him innocently and made a vague gesture with her hand . <p> Vanderhorst looked her up and down slowly , appraisingly , and said nothing . The silence drew to an uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has four circuits to his credit . He knows how  --  " <p> " Mostly , you 're asleep , " Vanderhorst broke in . His voice was bland , almost clinical , as if he were lecturing to an academy . " It 's bad when you 're awakened , because that means there 's trouble . You hope it 's not something that 's sent you shooting out into the universe with the sleep tank out of commission . That 's big trouble . You hope it 's something you can fix pretty damned fast . Once you 're awake , you ca n't wait to go back in the tank , because you do n't like what you 're thinking . You curse yourself for being fool enough to go up , and you begin to hate the people who sent you . You think of letting a big one slip by and give them a good scare . Then you hate yourself for thinking that way , and wonder if you 're going crazy . But you make the repairs and get back into the tank and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passes . " <p> Jake Fosset asked , " Why send people out at all ? " <p> " Ca n't trust the machines . " <p> " Then why use machines ? " <p> " Ca n't trust people , either . You need both . " <p> " Do we , really ? A lot of people question the rimrunner program . From what you say , they may have a point , " Fosset said . <p> Long periods of isolation had sharpened Vanderhorst 's receptiveness to unspoken communication ; he sometimes felt that he could read people as easily as he read an instrument screen . Fosset was not very subtly probing for reactions while his wife assisted and his boss observed . Vanderhorst had encountered their types in every generation . <p> " And what 's their point ? " Vanderhorst asked . <p> " POP is a costly program , and costs keep rising . We have no way of knowing whether or not it 's effective . A lot of people think there may be a better way of protecting ourselves . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific . It 's all very tentative , you understand . It may turn out that rimrunners are the best solution . " <p> Vanderhorst turned to Dalton . " Has anything hit Earth since ' 06 ? " <p> " Nothing big enough to frighten anyone , Captain . " <p> " Then maybe we 're effective . " <p> " Are you saying that the rimrunners deserve credit for the absence of asteroid strikes ? " Fosset said . " Well , really , Captain , I find that  --  " <p> " Who the hell else can claim credit ? You ? I did n't see anybody else out there , Fosset . Not you , not the Senator , not anybody . I was alone , protecting your ass . " <p> Vanderhorst 's eyes remained on Fosset . Others glanced at them , but kept a safe distance . Fosset backed away and Dalton said mildly , " Jake 's not trying to deny rimrunners the recognition and gratitude they 've earned , Captain . He 's only making the reasonable point that we ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your efforts . " <p> " So all you want is absolute certainty , and you 'll be satisfied . " <p> " Obviously that 's impossible . " <p> " It always was , and everybody knows it . POP is cheap insurance , Senator , nothing more . You stake a few billion a year against the chance of losing a thousand times as much . " <p> " It 's rather more than a few billion . " <p> " Even if we never spotted anything bigger than a snowball , we pay our way ten times over . " <p> " Very possibly . I must point out , though , that the country is currently experiencing economic difficulties , " Dalton said . <p> " Maybe that 's because lobies like this one are yapping about cutting the only government program that does what it 's supposed to do . " <p> " I confess I 've never looked at it that way , " Dalton said . Vanderhorst. felt a nudge in his ribs and turned to see Korry , looking agonized , close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to monopolize the guest of honor . We 'll talk again , Captain , " Dalton said , moving off smoothly , the Fossets in her wake . <p> When they were out of earshot , Jemma said in a low , furious voice , " Are you trying to destroy the program ? " <p> " You wanted me to talk to Dalton . I talked . " <p> " Yes , but the way you talked . ... " <p> " I do n't like her . Or her lapdog . They 're posturing frauds . If anyone in any government dared to cut the program and an asteroid the size of a golfball landed in the middle of the Gobi Desert , they 'd be lynched . They know it , you know it , I know it . But they play at being important and I hate them for it . " <p> " Van , you must n't  --  " <p> " I told you I 'm not good at this . " <p> " What was it you called Fosset ? " Korry asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that ? " Jemma demanded . <p> " Before your time . Forget it . " <p> She frowned and looked at Korry . He raised his brows and shook his head . Abruptly , Jemma 's eyes widened . She looked at Vanderhorst in horror and said , " That 's what they used to call lobotomized social offenders ! And the kids who imitated them , the lobie gangs . Vandals and criminals ! " <p> " It fits Fosset . Maybe Dalton , too . Now let 's drop it . I 've done my part and I want a drink . " He walked away and left them standing by themselves . <p> The lodge at Silverhill offered a prospect that Vanderhorst had dreamed of as he rode beyond the farthest orbit of the solar system . Soft hills , flower-carpeted , fell away to a crystal lake . Beyond them rose the mountains , green-skirted and crowned in white . The skies were clean . No cities , no houses , no other works of man were to be seen . This was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the planet he feared for and considered worth the risk of his life and his sanity . <p> Popular belief had downside rimrunners abandoning themselves to debauchery ; and indeed , while aloft Vanderhorst sometimes spun lurid fantasies of his coming Earthtime . But on his last two returns , he found that what he wanted most was time to sit back and look , to walk without boundaries and breathe unrecycled air . Thanks to eighty years ' accumulated wealth , he could patronize one of the few unspoiled areas in North America . <p> Vanderhorst had learned of Silverhill on his last return , and found that it offered a better method of reacculturation than POP had yet devised . Here one could see others and yet remain apart . Companionship could be had when it was desired and endured no longer than it pleased . <p> Open spaces brimming with the sounds and smells of life drew Vanderhorst on long solitary walks . He sat for hours on a hillside , or under a tree , his back against the rough bark , absorbing his surroundings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he glimpsed a hawk . He spent his days out of doors regardless of the weather . The warmth of sun or the cool touch of rain on his upturned face were equally welcome . The nightly return of familiar stars was assurance . <p> He dined elaborately with a companion engaged for the evening . There was no talk of social relations or government approval . Sometimes he chose to end the day alone . <p> Silverhill offered an oversized circumferential hollie unit for each lodge . The hollies had made great advances since his last time downside , and Vanderhorst found the sensation fascinating . Not long before , he had been wrapped in the vast emptiness of the fringes of interstellar space . Now he could immerse himself in a simulacrum of life . At the center of a swarm of humans that appeared as real as himself , he could participate in the intrigues and assignations of the mighty , be a witness to famous events , a partner to history and romance ; he could enjoy any experience he could conceive . And all came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a button . <p> One crisp and cloudless night he returned to his lodge and found the message light flashing . His first reaction was surprise , which turned almost at once to anger . He pressed the transmit plate . A smiling face appeared on the small screen . <p> " My message signal is on . Is it a mistake ? " <p> " No , sir . The message was received at 21:27 . " <p> " Who was it ? " <p> " The caller left no name , sir . It was voice only , no visual . " <p> " Are you sure it was for me ? " <p> " It was for the gentleman in Frostwood Lodge , sir . The caller left a number for you to call . " <p> " I do n't want any messages . Do n't connect anybody , understand ? " <p> " You will not be disturbed , sir . " <p> Vanderhorst was at Silverhill under a carefully maintained false identity , using a supposedly untraceable credit line . Damn POP and their meddling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefing time , and I want their claws out of my hide . He wondered whether Watts had called , or Korry , or Jemma , or some officious underling running errands for his chief ; and he wondered why there had been only a call , and no one had come bursting in on him , and how long it would be before they dared that . <p> After a simple dinner , he settled in the middle of the hollie and sampled the offerings . For lack of anything more interesting , he selected " Evening on the Town ( Comedy ) . " <p> A crowded room phased into existence around him , filled with the low murmur of muted conversations , the muffled clink and clatter of dining and drinking , occasional distant laughter , unobtrusive music in the background . A light blazed some five meters ahead and a young man in a gaudy cloak , leaning heavily on a long staff , limped into sight . <p> From his updating , Vanderhorst recognized the man as an eccentric , one of the popular entertainers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old standup comics and flatscreeners . By convention , they all affected a minor physical disability and pretended to great earnestness in their delivery . <p> " Here 's the latest from the colonies , " the limping man said , clasping both hands around his staff and thrusting his head forward . " Sixty-three lunies have kidnapped the Vice President of Terralune Gravitronics . One did the actual kidnapping . The other sixty-two are still trying to write the ransom note . " <p> Laughter rose around Vanderhorst . He did not join in . The eccentric brandished his staff and the laughter died . <p> " The lunies complain that everything we send up costs too much . They say we 're getting rich off them down here , " he said , looking about with a challenging glare . " What do they expect ? Every tube of soap has to come with an instruction program . " <p> The laughter began again . Vanderhorst cut it short with a jab of his finger . The crowd vanished , and he was alone in the circular room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunar colonists and did not enjoy jokes that belittled them . The worst things never change , he reflected . The staybehinds send others out to do their sweatwork and watch over their cozy world , and begrudge them so much as a " Thanks . " His father had told him how the staybehinds had treated veterans of his own long-forgotten war . It was no different then . But lunies and rimrunners had a deadlier enemy , and no hope of victory . Space always won in the end . Downsiders could not understand them , so they derided them . <p> Vanderhorst 's mood grew sour . The humor of this age angered him . He had heard those jokes before ; they were undying , and he despised those who laughed at mockery of better men and women . In the sixties the butt was the shackers , the swarms of poor that encircled every urban complex . Shackers were fair game for scorn : the methmen who recycled human waste were called " Shackie chefs " by urbanites whose chief concern in the sanctuary of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the lobies . Before that , there were other out-of-favor groups . <p> But never before had these jokes been public fare . He wondered what the lunar settlers had done  --  or achieved  --  to turn downsiders so openly against them . His sleep-cram had not been helpful on that subject . One day , he thought , it will be rimrunners . <p> Two days later , Senator Dalton came to Silverhill . She was seated on the deck of Frostwood Lodge when Vanderhorst returned at dusk from a day of solitary walking . <p> " What the hell are you doing here ? " Vanderhorst demanded . <p> " I had to see you , Captain . " <p> " I do n't want to see anybody . " <p> " Please , Captain . I have an important matter to discuss with you . " <p> " You tried to reach me the other night , did n't you ? " <p> " Yes . I 've tried several times since then . They refused to put me through , so I came myself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " To you and to the program . Give me a few minutes . If I ca n't persuade you to listen on , I 'll leave . " <p> Vanderhorst hesitated for a moment , frowning . " All right . We 'll talk out here . What do you want ? " <p> " To hear about POP 's work from someone who actually does it . " <p> " I told you the other night . The machines do the work . I 'm along in case they need a kick . On four runs I 've spent a total of fewer than a hundred hours awake . " <p> " How do you perceive the rimrunners ' mission ? " <p> " We 're the forward observers . We register incoming objects above a given mass , compute their trajectories , and send the data in to the Solomons . If the Solomons decide that an object is a danger to Earth or the colonies , they alert the Paladins . The Paladins take appropriate action . The system works . Forty-seven alerts and twenty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those takeouts a serious threat ? " <p> " The Solomons thought so . I wo n't argue . " <p> Dalton was silent for a time , then she said , " The Solomons and Paladins are unmanned . Do you have as much confidence in the unmanned satellites as you do in the Rimrunners ? " <p> " Why not ? They 're simpler . Less to go wrong . And they 're closer in , and moving slower , so they can be monitored from Earth . " <p> " What if you had a malfunction and could n't repair it ? " <p> " Depends on the malfunction . If it was in the instruments , no problem . The Solomons would pick up anything that got past a rimrunner . They 'd have less time and less data to work with , though . The odds in favor of the asteroid would improve . " <p> " And if the Solomons failed , too ? " <p> " The Paladins automatically destroy anything that reaches lunar orbit without clearance . " Vanderhorst gave a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friendly alien . " <p> " What if all three systems failed ? " <p> Vanderhorst shrugged . " You could pray . That 's what they did in the old days , is n't it ? " <p> " Do you believe in prayer ? " <p> " Under those conditions , I 'd pray whether I believed in it or not . " <p> " Suppose there was another kind of malfunction , something in the ship itself ? " <p> " Then I 'd be the farthest traveler in the history of the human race . " <p> Dalton nodded . " And what if Rimrunner Vanderhorst malfunctioned ? " <p> " What are you reaching for , Senator ? " <p> " Just suppose a rimrunner was awakened for an emergency and broke under the stress . What damage could he do ? Could he reroute his ship , or relay false data ? " <p> " Rimrunners do n't break . " <p> " Equipment does . Backup systems fail . So do people , more often than we like to admit . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know . I have to make decisions and recommendations , and I need data , not blind faith . " When Vanderhorst did not reply , she went on , " Did you know that during your last circuit , two downside rimrunners committed crimes of violence and one tried to kill herself ? The public hears these things and fears you . " <p> " Then let the public go out there . " <p> " Open up , Captain . You scorn the human race , and yet you go out time after time and risk your life to keep us safe . " Dalton raised a hand to forestall objection . " Do n't tell me you 're doing it for the money . You 're already one of the richest men in the world . " <p> " I go out for Earth 's sake . It 's a beautiful planet , and I want it to be here when the human race has slobbered its way into extinction . " <p> " There 's rather less chance of that than there was a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't noticed . Every time I come down I 'm disappointed . I keep telling myself I 'll do one more run , and things will be better . They never are . " <p> " The others feel almost exactly as you do . Every rimrunner spoke of loving the world and despising the people on it , " Dalton said . <p> " That 's what makes us good rimrunners . We 're not selected for our warm hearts . What difference does it make how we feel ? " <p> " It makes a great difference . There 's an unbridgeable gulf between the protectors and those they protect . " <p> " There always has been , Senator . All the way back to my father 's time , and probably a long time before that . " They sat enshrouded in darkness and silence . Dalton made no reply . At last Vanderhorst stood and said , " Come inside . We can talk better if we can see each other . " <p> Their footsteps resounded on the wooden deck . Vanderhorst entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dalton to a seat . " Tell me more about the others , " he said . <p> " I should think you 'd know them better than I do . " <p> Vanderhorst shook his head . " We do n't socialize , not even with other rimrunners . It 's not in our natures . I knew only one rimrunner well . Moira trained with me . We planned to go out for three runs each , then settle down to enjoy our fortunes . She walked out on me and POP first time downside . If Moira 's still alive , she 's a hundred and two years old . And I 'm thirty-four . Or a hundred and five , depending on how you calculate . Not your typical couple . " <p> " Rimrunners are n't typical . That 's why they make the public uneasy . " <p> " The average citizen could n't last ten days on a picket ship . That does n't mean that those who can are freaks . " <p> " I 'm not saying you 're freaks , Vanderhorst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that scares people . Take yourself , for example : born in a time of social unrest , your father a decorated hero in a war that many Americans condemned . Orphaned at seven and bounced around a dozen foster homes . Because of your work , you 've become a man without roots . Except for a score of rimrunners , everyone else born in your time is dead . " <p> " All true . But so what ? " <p> " You 're the living embodiment of two things the people of this time fear : violence and alienation . All our social analysts consider them the besetting sicknesses of the twentieth century and warn us that we 've survived only because we 've overcome them . " <p> " You have n't overcome them . You 've just learned to cover them over . " <p> " It may look that way to you , but violence is rare these days , and alienation afflicts only a small number . Yet the rimrunners  --  people we need , people we trust to be our first line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ills . " <p> " Why do n't you just put us in quarantine ? Send us up , but do n't let us land . " <p> " That 's been suggested . " <p> " This is the first I 've heard . Spell it out for me . " <p> " This is confidential , Captain . Understood ? Absolutely confidential . " <p> " Understood . " <p> " Three years ago , a special commission recommended that rimrunner operations be moved to Luna IV and consolidated with the Solomon and Paladin complexes . A settlement was to be built especially for rimrunner personnel  --  " <p> " The ungrateful gutless bastards , " Vanderhorst said , rising . <p> " The recommendation was soundly rejected . It 's never come up again . I mention it only as a sign of the fears in some minds . " <p> " Some minds . Descendants of the sons of bitches who spat at my father when he came back from a war they dodged . " Vanderhorst sank back into his chair . He stared blankly ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'd be smart to leave now , " he said at last . <p> " I fought the recommendation , and helped defeat it . I 'll fight it again , i ( it comes up . " <p> Without moving , Vanderhorst said , " When I lock in from my next circuit , it will be 2107 . You 'll be in your eighties . Maybe you 'll be dead . Which way will the vote go then ? " <p> " You could stay down and work for the program . " <p> " Surrounded by lobies who think I 'm crazy ? I 'll go up , Senator . " <p> " I 'm sorry , " Dalton said . She rose and left the lodge . A few minutes after her departure , Vanderhorst , in a hushed voice , said , " Thanks . " He drew himself up out of the chair and poured himself a drink . <p> Shortly after one o'clock , bottle in hand , he made his way to the communications panel and punched in Korry and Jemma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he waited , and at last the screen glowed to life to reveal a sleepy Jemma . <p> " Van ! Are you all right ? " <p> " You told Dalton . Let us think we 're being left alone , but you 're always looking , keeping an eye on us so we do n't screw up your handout . " <p> " Tell us where you are , Van , so we can help you . " <p> " I do n't want your help . I do n't want anything to do with any of you . " <p> Jemma 's voice was low , taut with controlled urgency . " Van , tell us where you are . We 'll come to you , and we 'll work this out together . It 's better that way . Trust us , Van . " <p> Vanderhorst rubbed his eyes . When he looked again , he glimpsed Jemma 's gesture to someone beyond screen range . At the sight of him , she reached out imploringly and said , " Please tell us , Van @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , he drew back his arm and with all his strength flung the bottle squarely into the screened image . He stood for a few minutes before the shattered panel , feeling a great satisfaction , then he turned and quickly gathered his few possessions . <p> Except for the pale green carpet , everything in the room was a cool restful blue . The colors , Vanderhorst had been told by smiling , earnest social assistants , would help him relax . He did not relax . They looked at him ruefully , spoke to him gently , and never stopped smiling . <p> On his second morning in the Assistance House , he began to wonder how long he would be staying . Unfailing smiles and bland words did not deceive him . He was a prisoner and he knew it . If alienation and violence were crimes in 2087 , then he was a criminal . If they were illnesses , he was a patient . Whatever they chose to consider him , he was not free . <p> For the moment , he was content to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cut and swollen , and there was a painful lump on his temple . Whatever the authorities might think , there were still a few violent people left out there . His knuckles were heavily coated with curafilm , and he found it awkward and uncomfortable to flex his fingers . His memory was jumbled . He had drunk a great deal , roared against the human race , struck out at everyone who came within reach ; that much he could remember . And now he was thoroughly disgusted with himself . He did not belong to this time , and never would . <p> A soft tone announced his morning meal . He rose from his bed , stretched , and went to the serving slot . The screen above the opening brightened at his approach , and a smiling young woman appeared , greeting him , " Good morning , Captain Vanderhorst . Did you sleep well ? " <p> " I always sleep very well . It 's a big part of my job . " <p> " We want you to get back into proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body these past  --  " <p> " How about breakfast ? " he broke in . <p> " Certainly , Captain . Do you feel more like talking with us today ? We 're very fortunate . The senior counselor is free all afternoon , and he 's personally interested in offering you  --  " <p> " All I want from anyone here is breakfast . Do I get it ? " <p> She took on the expression of a mother whose child has misbehaved and now revels in his misbehavior . " Captain Vanderhorst , if you tried to understand what we want to do for you , I 'm sure you 'd be glad to cooperate with us . " <p> " I never cooperate on an empty stomach . " <p> Each meal on that and the following days was served to a similar accompaniment of cajolery and gently expressed concern . Early in the evening of the fifth day , as Vanderhorst sat at his pale blue table , playing solitaire , his door opened . A husky junior social assistant stood in the opening . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Will you come with me , please , Captain Vanderhorst ? " <p> " Where are we going ? " <p> " You 've been cleared for re-entry in the mainstream . For your own sake , Captain , you ought to  --  " <p> " Just show me the way out . " <p> To his surprise , the young man did so at once . Vanderhorst had anticipated a marathon of interviews and a final outpouring of solicitude by the entire staff of the Assistance House . Instead , he was led through pale blue corridors and down gentle ramps to a plain door . The junior social assistant handed him his travel case , opened the door , and said , " It was our pleasure to offer assistance , Captain Vanderhorst . " <p> Vanderhorst did not reply . He was too surprised by the sight of Senator Dalton , standing by a private landroller . <p> " Did you get me out ? " he asked . <p> " I spoke to a few people . Are you ready to go up again ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " As long as I have any influence , you 've got a home here . I hope you 'll make less trouble next time , though , " she said . <p> " I 'll be a hundred and twenty-five when I get back . Maybe I 'll be wiser . " <p> " And I 'll be eighty-one , as you reminded me . I 'll be supporting you , but my support may not be as effective as it is now . Things could go against you and the program . You must know that . " <p> Vanderhorst shrugged . " I would n't help the cause much if I stayed down . I 'm not a good politician . " <p> Dalton laughed . " That may be the greatest understatement I 've ever heard . I guess we 're all better off sticking with what we do best . " <p> Vanderhorst settled into the comfort of the landroller . It left the Assistance Compound slowly , then dipped and locked into the exurban track and accelerated to cruising speed . Embankments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The evening sky unrolled above , unobstructed and undefiled . <p> He believed that Dalton would keep her word and do her best , but he had no illusions and to his surprise , felt no concern . A home on Earth might be his by right , but Dalton 's success or failure in assuring it hardly mattered now . There was no place here for Vanderhorst . <p> He loved the sight of this world , so bright against the blackness , so much easier to look at than to live on . On Luna , he could have the view without the complications . Gravity would be easier , too , and require no adjusting . He might even meet people he could talk to , and like , and live with in peace . He could be happy there . <p> He burst into sudden laughter , and Dalton looked at him curiously . <p> Grinning , he said , " I was thinking what my father would say if he knew that I was trusting my future to a politician . " <p> He threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tension and anger of downside drop away like a cast-off garment . The sky was a deeper blue now , and the first stars were out . Vanderhorst looked up and sighed with satisfaction . It was good to be heading home . <p> <p> <p> By John Morressy <p> John Morressy retired from teaching at the end of 1995 and is catching up on lots of reading now , not to mention his own writing . His most recent novel is The Juggler and we can expect new stories of the magician Kedrigern to grace these pages soon . Here , however , we have a very different sort of story , a tale of a space worker who finds that time plays tricks on everybody , and wonders if perhaps the same might be said of politicians . <p>
