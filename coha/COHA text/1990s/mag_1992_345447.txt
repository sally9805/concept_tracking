Who cares about a few spotted owls when loggers ' jobs are at stake ? Why worry about caribou when America needs more of Alaska 's oil ? Who can afford to think about the environment when the economy is the pits ? <P> When times get tough , the questions facing environmentalists get even tougher . And these days , economic anxieties and shifting political winds are threatening to produce a green-out effect that could make tree huggers feel as endangered as the California condor . Epochal events such as the gulf war and the collapse of the Soviet Union have pushed most domestic ecological concerns off the front pages . The recession has prompted many people to question the costs of environmentalism and made it harder for preservation groups to raise money and boost membership . In the presidential campaign , saving the planet has become an orphaned issue . No savvy candidate would dwell on ozone depletion and the need for biodiversity when voters are worrying about whether they 'll have a job next year or be able to pay their medical bills . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever , but recruits are getting harder to find . For every organization that is still growing  --  membership in the Nature Conservancy jumped 15% last year , to 620,000  --  another one seems to have hit a plateau . After expanding in 1990 , the Sierra Club stayed level at about 620,000 members last year and fell short of its goal of boosting contributions 10% . The National Wildlife Federation had to trim its work force 8% in 1991 , and the Wilderness Society laid off 10 of 136 staffers . Says David Gardiner , who heads the Sierra Club 's Washington office : " There 's no question that 1991 was a disappointing year for protecting the environment . We are marking time when we should be moving forward . " <P> But there is no marking time in the opposition camp , which is more organized than ever before . Scores of interest groups  --  including ranchers , miners , loggers , developers and manufacturers  --  have become allies in a " wise-use movement " to fight what they see as the extremism of those who put wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of humans . " There seems to be a coalescing of different economic interests to fight the green devils , " observes environmentalist Thomas Lovejoy of the Smithsonian Institution . <P> This antigreen brigade advocates economic development in wilderness areas , arguing that land can be used wisely for human benefit without destroying Mother Nature . The timing of the campaign is excellent , since two landmark pieces of environmental legislation are up for renewal in Congress this year : the Endangered Species Act , which prohibits development that drives a species to extinction ; and the Clean Water Act , which contains a provision protecting wetlands from uncontrolled exploitation . The wise-users are pressuring Congress to weaken those laws as a way to spur economic growth . Another goal is to block proposed reforms of the federal mining law that would make it harder for companies to open mines on public land . " Anytime anyone gets as much power as the environmental movement has achieved , a backlash can be expected , " says Oregon logger Tom Hirons.            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
