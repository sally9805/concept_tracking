I Ca n't Just Forgive and Forget ! <p> My sister lives 6 hours away and calls my mom only when she wants something . This year , my mom wants a family holiday . For this to happen , my sister would have to stay with us . I 'm already in knots just thinking of having to be nice to her-much less having her in my home . How do I get through this ? <p> If only family reunions were as relaxing as advertised ! Unfortunately , they often rekindle old feelings that may be positive or negative . When an older parent is at the center , the situation can be even more stressful , as grown children begin to debate what their individual caregiving obligations are to a parent with whom they each have had a different relationship . <p> In your case , the issue is n't as much about the relationship either of you have with your mother , but the relationship you have with each other . Clearly , you have anger toward your sister . I 'm not privy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to this point , but I 'm willing to assume that your resentment is justified . Now , let 's develop a game plan that maintains your mental health and makes for a reunion that will give your mother pleasant memories . Making Nice Versus Making Progress <p> Your first order of business , I think , is to decide whether you want to be nice to your sister for a week and tolerate those stomach knots , or whether you want to be honest with her for a week and preserve your sanity and self-esteem . Neither is easy , but I 'd vote for the honest approach . <p> First , ask yourself whether your anticipated discomfort stems from your sister 's inappropriate behavior as your guest in the past , or from feelings you 've had about her selfishness . If it 's the former , and she winds up behaving in a manner not befitting a houseguest , then I 'd send her packing . If she has no money , then lend her some for the local budget motel . Even if you get stiffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is your mother aware of the potential discomfort this is causing you ? If she is , she might incorporate your concerns into her planning of this get-together . At the very least , she might chip in for accommodations that do n't involve you . <p> But if your sister 's behavior in your home has been reasonable in the past , and your queasiness stems from resentment and anger , then you need a strategy to deal with that . ( See " Grown-Ups with Grudges " on p. 173 . ) In general , this involves an honest and forthright approach with your sister that , in the short-term , will be difficult but may ultimately bring peace of mind . In any case , you ca n't constantly bemoan the behavior that you find objectionable until you 've reasonably expressed to her why you find it so . <p> There is one last-resort option : boycotting this family get-together completely . I would hope that you do n't need to do this . But if you 've made reasonable attempts to accommodate your mom 's and sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to some reciprocity for your good faith . That 's what families are for in the first place , right ? It would be nice to honor your mom 's wishes for a reunion , but if you can honestly say that everyone 's needs have been considered but your own , you 'll only be encouraging the practice in the future . Quick Tip <p> To get through a difficult time , rely on your friends and family for support and advice . Vent with a friend when you feel the need to blow off steam . <p> Worried about your parents ?

Lachs , MD , MPH <p> Before you can dissolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategize . Redford B. Williams , MD , director of the Behavioral Medicine Research Center at Duke University Medical Center in Durham , NC , and coauthor of Lifeskills ( Times Books-Random House , 1999 ) , offers some suggestions . Consider the situation . First , assess how important the problem is to you . Decide what kind of relationship you hope to have with this person-and be realistic . Acting cordially in social settings and forging a friendship will require different tactics . Look within . It 's important to survey your own emotions before confronting someone else 's . Take a step back and examine your own faults and feelings . Your anger may be less about another person 's actions and more about your own insecurities . Is it possible you overreacted ? Talk to an objective friend or family member and get their perspective . Put yourself in her place . After you 've addressed you , try to understand the person you resent . Perhaps something happened in her life that you do n't know about . Many outside factors prey on our emotions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Determine if change is an option . Ask yourself , " Can I alleviate the situation , and how much effort will it take ? " If your pain is deep and uncompromising but the other party is unresponsive to reestablishing a relationship , you may not be able to resolve it . Take action . If change seems possible , confront the person you are angry with and tell them how you feel-but constructively . Precede remarks that might be seen as critical with what Dr. Williams calls an empathetic stroke . Say , " I know you were going through hard times , but ... " before you say " what you did really hurt me . " This will show that you 're not attacking her , but that you care . Dr. Williams also suggests a structured dialogue for greater understanding . First , sit down with the person and discuss the issue that caused you pain . Give your perspective of the problem for 5 minutes . Then allow the other person 2 minutes to recap your side of the story and 1 minute for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then in the same way , listen to their take on the issue . This process will show how your thinking differs . If necessary , continue the dialogue with this issue or select another topic to hash out . With each step , you come closer to resolving hurt feelings . Accept . " This does n't mean forgive and forget , " says Dr. Williams . It means resolving anger within yourself , acknowledging another person 's shortcomings ( and possibly your own ) , and moving on with your life . Though you may not emerge as best friends , you 'll make strides toward understanding and liberating yourself from inner conflict . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Follow these rules for your next grudge match <p> By Mark S.
