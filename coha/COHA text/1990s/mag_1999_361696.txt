When the end of the most lopsided 78-day war in history finally came , the champagne was for the losers . In Belgrade last Wednesday night , thousands of young Serbs unburdened themselves in the city 's Republic Square , dangling out the windows of their cars , blaring the horns and chanting " Serbia ! Serbia ! " They lit red magnesium flares and launched fireworks into the night sky . " I feel great , " said Olivera Todorovic , 22 . " It 's a wonderful feeling to live again in peace . " <P> Elsewhere the celebrations were fleeting . Bill Clinton openly declared " victory " in a nationally televised address Thursday night , followed by a triumphal tour Friday of Whiteman Air Force Base , home to the lethal B-2 bombers that emerged as the technological heroes of the war . But that evening , faces at the White House turned ashen . Commanders of Russian troops in Bosnia , evidently worried about the fate of Kosovar Serbs , had rumbled into Pristina , Kosovo 's capital , despite an earlier understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with NATO on command of the peacekeepers . On Saturday , Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov apologized and said the troops would withdraw , but as the day wore on , they stayed put , effectively in charge of the airport . <P> The 200 Russian troops were no threat to the allied forces , but their bizarre deployment set off worries about whether Russian President Boris Yeltsin was in control of his own military , or whether he had sanctioned the early troop movement as a concession to hard-line generals dismayed by Russia 's lack of influence in Kosovo . Publicly , however , U.S. officials tried to put the best spin on the situation . " We would like them to participate in the peacekeeping mission , " said Defense Secretary William Cohen . " Whether they arrive a few hours earlier or later really is not a significant factor . " <P> From the start of the conflict , the U.S. and its allies knew that after the bombing stopped , they would assume the responsibility for keeping peace in Kosovo ; that it would require thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serbian civilians and the Kosovo Liberation Army ( K.L.A. ) ; and that the mission would be long and costly . But all that was supposed to get going after a few days of air strikes  --  not after three months , during which the Serbs reduced Kosovo to a wasteland and turned more than 800,000 Kosovars into refugees . The Administration 's price tag for patrolling and rehabilitating Kosovo will run into billions of dollars . But given that there are 400,000 displaced persons within Kosovo , things may be even worse . " We are all waiting with some trepidation , " said U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright , " about what happens when we actually get into Kosovo . "
