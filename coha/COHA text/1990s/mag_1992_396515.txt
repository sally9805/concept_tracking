On the day before New Hampshire voters rocketed him to stardom , a bleary-eyed Paul Tsongas reported at 7 A.M. to the Lowell ( Mass . ) Sheraton Inn for a satellite interview with The Today Show 's Katie Couric . As he seated himself before the cameras , he gave an embarrassed grin and tucked the tail of his jacket beneath him-a trick practiced by the pros . " I feel like a model , " confessed the candidate . " How do you like my new tie ? It was a gift from my voice coach . Next , " he added dryly , " I ' ' 11 be wearing an earring . " Once stubbornly opposed to spit and polish , the self-deprecating Tsongas - known for his understated style and melancholy mien  --  has undergone a striking metamorphosis . Just last spring he was stumping by himself , ignoring jokes about the grim fate awaiting Greek presidential hopefuls from Massachusetts . As he climbed slowly in the polls , however , he reluctantly agreed to take a bit of coaching  --  and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ties . Last week , of course , he won the greatest victory of his career when he beat all Democratic comers in New Hampshire , taking 33 percent of the vote in the primary . These days he has no trouble attracting attention . On Feb. 18 alone , his office received 44 bags of mail . No one is more surprised by his success than the one-term Senator from Massachusetts , who retired from public life in 1984 to battle cancer . " I never thought it would come to this , " says Tsongas . " Here I am , an eight-year has-been .... It 's so improbable . " For the 51-year-old Tsongas , his political resurrection marked a double miracle . After he found a swollen gland in his groin in 1983 , doctors told him that he had a form of lymphoma that had never been cured . Scrapping plans to run for reelection , he joined a law firm in Boston in order to spend more time with daughters Ashley , Katina and Molly ( now 18 , 14 and 10 ) and wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safeguard his family 's future . When his condition deteriorated in 1985 , Tsongas underwent a radically experimental bone-marrow transplant at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston . It was an excrutiating ordeal : After chemotherapy , doctors extracted bone marrow that would be reimplanted after his body was bombarded with high-energy photons designed to destroy both his immune system and any rogue cells . Claustrophobic since childhood , he spent six weeks isolated in a small , germ-free room following the transplant . Now , he says , " I consider myself cured . " ( Adds his doctor : " I do n't know the other candidates ' health , but I would say his is better than the average American 's . " ) While some have suggested that Tsongas ' medical history will be a campaign drawback , voters seem willing to judge him on the issues . An erstwhile lobbyist who has drawn fire for his pro-business , pro-nuclear-power stance , he maintains that self-sacrifice is the cure for the nation 's economic ills . He prescribes tax breaks for businesses and an emphasis on long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters peeking into Tsongas ' closet will be disappointed . A loyal family man , he lauds Niki ( who started law school during his illness ) as " an amazing woman . " Says Tsongas : " Half my staff is in love with her . " Despite his apparent moral and political cleanliness , however , he is likely to be haunted by the nebbish " factor . Dubbed Saint Paul by colleagues put off by his preachiness , the short , balding candidate has an occasional speech impediment and a negligible stage presence . For all of that , he is impatient with the suggestion that he needs to generate a more powerful image . To one voter , he cracked , " Look at the Japanese . Who was their last charismatic prime minister ? " If the White House seems a long shot , Tsongas is comfortable with the role of underdog . The grandson of Greek immigrants who ran a dry-cleaning business in Lowell , he was a scholarship student at Dartmouth . After a two-year stint with the Peace Corps , he made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wed Niki Sauvage and plunged into politics . In his 1969 campaign for Lowell City Council , he established a pattern that he would repeat . Pegged as a no-chance candidate , he beat seven rivals in the primary , then defeated an incumbent Republican . " It 's always the same , " says his Maryland campaign chairman , Patrick Smith . " He 's the first to announce , he 's given no chance of winning and surprises everyone when he does . " When he announced last spring that he was running for President , even his friends , he says , were worried that he would fail . " There were a lot of them that said , " Nice guy , had a nice career , went out on top , why make a fool of yourself ? ' ' " he remembers . Though former Senate colleagues wished him well , none came forward to endorse him . Slowly however , the volunteers appeared  --  a cadre of students , Republican recruits , old supporters , Peace Corps veterans and cancer survivors . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes to talk to people with cancer , " says Torri Davis , 27 , a survivor who was one of his first volunteers . Whether Tsongas can make it beyond his home turf , of course , is another question . Even supporters concede that he could be mere cannon fodder for George Bush in the fall . But in politics nothing is certain . " Who knows ? " says Democratic media consultant Bob Squier . " He 's moving up , he 's the only one with a real message , and he has a terrific view of himself . " That , and a belief that miracles do happen-sometimes to him . <p>
