BOOKS <P> KING EDWARD VIII by Philip Ziegler ( Knopf ; $24.95 ) .

This searching novel about a woman who is one of life 's losers creates a character who is crazy enough to be interesting and sane enough to describe her own incompetence . <P> I AM A TEACHER : A TRIBUTE TO AMERICA 'S TEACHERS by David Marshall Marquis and Robin Sachs ( Simon &; Schuster ; $29.95 ) . In this chronicle of the nation 's best teachers , 78 classroom veterans speak thoughtfully , sometimes passionately , of their profession 's rewards and sorrows ; accompanied by Sachs ' evocative photographs . <P> TELEVISION <P> LUCY &; DESI : BEFORE THE LAUGHTER ( CBS , Feb. 10 , 9 p.m .

Could McCartney 's 1990 world tour have been as good as this larky , occasionally inspired live set makes it sound ? Missed it ? Check out these two CDs , and let some older memories kick in . <P> THE TRASH CAN SINATRAS : CAKE ( Go ! Discs Ltd. /London ) . Nice name , guys . But you already knew that . Actually , these five English lads lay down an excellent brand of pub pop : simple , insinuating melodies , lyrics with propulsive good humor . Has the guy from Hoboken heard you yet ? <P> SCHONBERG : CHORUS <P> MUSIC ( Sony Classical ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-tone composition has created widespread resistance to his work , some of which is indeed forbidding . But if converts to his remarkably disparate choral music are to be won , these authoritative Pierre Boulez-led performances ought to do the job . <P> THEATER <P> LOST IN YONKERS . Neil Simon elevated himself from jokester to artist in an autobiographical trilogy during the mid-1980s . He returns to themes from his youth in his 26th Broadway-bound play , now at Washington 's National Theater . <P> TRU . Robert Morse brings back to life the author , wit , bon vivant , self-pitier and true enchanter that was Truman Capote in this Tony-winning one-man performance , now on national tour , in Los Angeles through March 10 . <P> GRAND HOTEL . The main reason to see this show on Broadway was Tommy Tune 's sinuous staging , superbly fitted to its space . On tour , this week in Cleveland , it looks at once distant and squashed . The only compelling performance is by Brent Barrett as a doomed , down-on-his-luck aristocrat.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
