Touring THEIRS WAS A rural community tucked away from the city . A four-lane intersection with a stoplight protected their neighborhood 's timeless character from office buildings , fast-food restaurants , traffic , and white people . Fathers had built dirt-surface basketball courts , taught the kids softball , given them bicycles , buried the dead pets . They worked as mechanics , gardeners , bricklayers and farmers . One sold insurance , maybe one was in jail or prison , some were Korean War veterans , some were dead , and some , like Grim 's father , were missing . The neighborhood had changed . Many longtime residents had died , and their children had moved away , taking the grandchildren with them . Many of the old houses were now rental properties -- cheaply and sloppily painted purple and white , orange and brown , marigold and blue -- and oddly dull . One of the houses actually improved , as if restored to a pride known before the former owners became too sick and too old to plant flowers in the yard , to replace a faded awning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renters , people from who knew where , move out of gutted , littered husks . Strange people in strange cars rolled up and down the streets . The liquor house became a drug house . The new economy , Rita , Grim 's sister , mused . Bonnie 's place , now that Bonnie was dead , was run by her son . He sold more heroin than booze and used the house not to make a profit , as Bonnie had done , but to earn a nod . Neighbors warned Rita . Neighborhood boys had started going to Bonnie 's to shoot and snort smack . But the boys were older than Grim , seventeen at least . And Rita kept Grim too busy . Weekends and summers he was at camps -- art , karate , basketball , science . She 'd sent him to private schools in town since nursery school . After their father left , Rita became Grim 's guardian . Their mother had died in a car crash when Grim was four and Rita was nineteen . Two years later their father , who traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip and never came back . So Rita had pretty much been a parent despite one of them always reminding the other that she was certainly not Grim 's mother . Also , she taught math and was studying for her master 's . These responsibilities gave her both community nobility and the disposition of a boss . Still , she cried often , in her sleep . The cry would start low and rise in volume and pitch , a ghostly , frightening wail to Grim . She did n't cry every night , but sometimes she screamed Grim 's name . At first she would n't tell him what she dreamed , but later she did , after he started teasing and mimicking her . Someone was chasing her , and then him , or they were falling . Often , Rita was straining to reach Grim and snatch away syringes that bristled from his long thin body . Eventually , because he asked her , she told him everything . She remembered everything . When he had holidays or a free weekend she took him to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some elderly person who had n't left the area . Some nights they went to meetings of the school board or the board of aldermen where they sat in the audience and Rita spoke out against harmful school closings and zoning laws . That 's where she met Mayes , her boyfriend , who taught high-school physics and raised his own voice against changes he thought would hurt the neighborhoods . Mayes lived in the city , where urban renewal was turning the streets of his students into a ghetto , just as flight to and from those streets was making a scar of Rita 's community . Most nights Rita liked to sit on the porch . From her slant she watched a group of young men gather across and up the street . They stood near a dull fire hydrant in front of a tree-filled vacant lot , drank quart bottles of beer and smoked . The lot 's owner had installed a light on a pole on which he 'd nailed No Trespassing signs . The boys pulled the signs down , and the owner put them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of reach . The boys stood on each other 's shoulders to snatch them , and the pole was dotted with stapled corners of thin red cardboard . These were some of the boys who drifted to and from Bonnie 's . During the winter they rolled a rusted oil drum to the spot and built orange-yellow fires , tilted up beer bottles to send quick tracers of firelight from their dark fingers . Some of the boys should have been in Rita 's math classes by now , but none of them was likely to go to college . She thought this as she sat shivering in her overcoat covering her flannel pajamas , and smoked her cigarettes . She hoped the cold would freeze their brains to clarity . When spring came they were still there , eyes like moons , feeding her dreams . One Saturday that spring Rita woke to the sound of a lawnmower , the first of the season . Its sudden , urgent whine lifted her out of sleep . The first thing she saw was the white-blooming Bradford pear tree filling her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attic window . The tree had opened full overnight . She was in such a good mood she slipped out to the store to buy melons and berries for breakfast . When Grim came into the kitchen , she poured batter onto the waffle iron . He had been in his room practicing rope tricks , spinning small loops to hop in and out of , and lassoing his bedposts , the straight-back chair and the floor lamp with the Western-scene shade . He watched steam issue from the waffle iron and noted Rita 's happiness . It seemed extraordinary . She had been sad lately , and now she was grinning and sliding about the kitchen in her socks , way beyond her normal good mood . He saw his bicycle by the opened back door and realized she 'd been riding it . Maybe , because of her mood , she 'd agree to drop him off alone at a movie . But Rita told him of her plan to visit Mrs. Pack for lunch . Mrs. Pack had been Grim 's preschool teacher , and her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'd nearly been killed in a fight with his grandnephew , who had broken into their trailer . The luncheon was to cheer up Kip and to thank Rita for cooking a few meals , washing loads of clothes , and taking some bills to the post office during the ordeal . Once on the long dirt road to the Packs ' , Grim drove . He was twelve . During the winter , they had spent cold , dry Sundays on deserted two-lanes , Grim driving the Cutlass , Rita acting as if his driving was a novelty . But he knew how to drive . Soon Rita would settle into the routine -- peering into the woods for cardinals and deer , hoping to glimpse lovers hiking over leaf mounds . The woods on the way to the Packs ' were filled with floating pink and white dogwoods and wafting veils of wisteria . Wisteria traced the old wooden arch over the entrance to the Packs ' rutted driveway . " Slow down , " Rita said , grinning and bouncing . Kip sat at one of two white-draped card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer they got , the more things swayed -- the grass , the skirts of the tablecloths , the trailing vines of the willow under which Kip sat . They jostled to a stop in front of Kip , beside the Packs ' shiny brown Chrysler parked along the honeysuckle vines covering the property-line fence . Kip was still bandaged , his arms and right hand swathed in padded gauze . His eyes were bruised . He wore a brown-and-blue plaid short-sleeved shirt buttoned formally at the neck . A translucent pitcher of lemonade -- circles of lemon slices floating -- glowed on the table with four , ice-filled daisy-printed glasses . He had suffered broken ribs , a punctured lung , a concussion , and multiple cuts . He had fought off the grandnephew with only one leg , because diabetes had already claimed the other one . But today he had a new prosthesis under his stiffly starched khakis . He slowly turned a knobby , thickly shellacked cane by his knee as he smiled at Rita 's and Grim 's approach . Black , buglike stitches traced his upper lip . Rita said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She hugged him and kissed his cheek . He had shaved unevenly , patches of white stubble under his nose and on his jaw and chin . " I 'm a shell of the man I used to be , darlin ' . " " Oh , really ? Oh my , what a shell . " " Heh-heh . " He looked at Grim . " Hey , boy . " He held out his left , unbandaged hand , and Grim met it with his right hand . Grim grasped Kip 's over the top and they shook that way , awkwardly , as if building shaky team spirit . " Lemonade ? " Kip asked , as he fanned flies from the mouth of the pitcher . Mrs. Pack came out the trailer door carrying a foil-covered bowl . " Potato salad , " Kip said . " Your old man looks great , " Rita called out . " I do n't itch , " Kip said . " Yeah ? I guess he looks O.K. , " Mrs. Pack said . She was barefoot , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with white stitching . Her sky blue sleeveless knit top exposed heavy , muscular arms and hands . She placed the bowl on the table and turned to hug Rita . " You could give him the palpitations on top of all else . So young and little and smelling good . He 's suffered enough , " she said , laughing . " Shell of a man , " Kip said . She hugged Grim . Sweat already beaded up through her too-tan makeup . She wore red lipstick and rouge . She had shaved , too . In preschool , her shaving bothered Grim . At the end of the day he was usually the last kid stranded . Rita was always late , often from a meeting at the high school where she taught then , or from a class she was taking . On very late days , Mrs. Pack either could n't wait any longer or could n't think of anything else to do , or maybe she had to get ready for an engagement of her own -- so she left the bathroom door open to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her shoulder and shaved . She lathered up with a brush and bar of soap , squared her sideburns and carefully down-stroked her chin and cheeks . Grim thought he should n't have to see that . Mrs. Pack frowned with distaste , too . She 'd wipe her face with the towel and turn to him . She kept the sink 's faucet running while she spread a pink cream over her lip . She 'd grimace , and then try to smile at Grim . Rita went with Mrs. Pack to the trailer to fetch more food . Grim sat with Kip and asked about the guinea hens they kept in a pen out back . Usually , out of boredom , he would walk behind the trailer to look at them , and he was anticipating doing so soon . " We lost a couple , " Kip said . " Just last night . Weasel . " " Weasel ? " " Pop goes it . " Grim worried about what Kip meant for a second . Kip rolled his eyes upward and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A real weasel ? " Grim asked . " Weasels everywhere . Maybe it was a fox . But weasels like guineas . " " I 've never seen a real weasel . They live around here ? How come I never saw one ? " " Sam saw it . " Sam was their dog , a small old tan-and-black breed they kept tied to the willow . His face was on the ground behind the tree trunk . The most Grim had seen Sam do was sneeze . " He yapped at it , " Kip said . " We came out here with him straining on that rope , guineas squawking . Lola got the shotgun but the thing was gone . Two birds , too . " He fanned a couple of flies from the pitcher . " Brand-new shotgun . Just got it , " no doubt suspecting Grim was wondering about the break-in , like why they had n't shot the grandnephew . Rita and Mrs. Pack returned with covered platters . " Fried chicken , corn on the cob , greens , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pie later . " They set the platters on the second table , which had paper plates stacked in the center . " It 's got hot out here . Pour yourself some of that lemonade , " Mrs. Pack said to Grim . " Or do you want a beer ? " " No , ma'am , " Grim laughed with her . " Too early . " " Rita ? You ? Me and Kip about give up strong drink . But we still got beer . Kip ca n't have none . " " You 've been trying to get Grim drunk since he was a baby , " Rita said . She peeked under the foil cover of one platter and did a double take at the fried chicken . The pepper on it was moving . She looked again . Her thoughts had been racing all morning , and it could have been her own mind making the pepper skitter . She checked the sliced pork , and its pepper moved , too . She realized she was looking at ants . The greens -- she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some comfort in them -- swarmed with ants . " Mrs. Pack , we 've got a lot of little problems here . We ca n't eat this . " " What , honey ? Why not ? " She saw the ants , and she put her big hands to her rouged cheeks and rubbed hard , a raspy sound . " Lord , Kip , what happened ? I cooked all this food and we ca n't use it . " " It would have been good , too , " Rita said . " You 're such a great cook . " " Them ants sure love it . " Grim laughed . Rita looked at him , disapproval in the tilt of her head . " And I 've been nibbling all morning , " Mrs. Pack said . " You reckon I been eating ants ? Sheesh . " She made her look of distaste , her lips twisting as when she watched herself shave . " Ants are good food . Ants ca n't hurt you . But watch out for fly legs , though . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Pack said . " It 's all right . " Rita put her hand on Mrs. Pack 's broad back . " We can go get something . Go out . " Mrs. Pack looked to Sam lying on the ground . She stomped . " Damn good-for-nothing dog . " " It 's not his fault , is it ? " Grim asked . " Hot dogs , it is , " Rita said . " When 's the last time you had a good hot dog ? " " You get yourself a fly leg and you got yourself trouble , " Kip explained . " It 'll gripe you good . " " Oh , Kip . Pour the damn lemonade . Hush with that old folk lie . Always got some fake wisdom when you ought to be helping keep ants off my food . " " Ai n't no lie , honey . For me , though , it 's unusual to regurgitate . Now my sack ai n't iron , but if something disagrees with me , say like a fly leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cauldron -- a boiling cauldron -- but regurgitate , no . " They decided to leave the food on the tables , to leave it for whatever animals wanted it . Mrs. Pack went to get her shoes and to lock up the trailer . Rita poured lemonade over the melting ice in the glasses . She was conscious of the sun lighting everything . She was thinking so fast she felt she could almost catch the light before it shone in the pouring stream of lemonade . Grim rode with Kip in the back of the Packs ' Chrysler . " We 're in a cloud in here , " he said , feeling hardly a bump on the ruts and rocks of the driveway and dirt road . " This car is great . " Kip smiled at him . Grim settled into the soft leather corner and watched spring scroll by . Rita wished she was somewhere else -- home with the clean coral red kitchen countertops their father had installed before she was born . She wanted to gaze out at the pear tree , breathe its musky scent . This morning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom window . She thought about Mayes , whose hair was turning prematurely white . He was only thirty-three , two years older than she was . Now , she would rather have been breathing that tree with him than in Mrs. Pack 's atrocious car . It was a huge ostentatious gas hog , inappropriate for a woman living in a rotting , ant-infested trailer . Mrs. Pack had gone blind or crazy , and Rita did n't want to be around that decline right now -- not when her tree was blooming , not when she was forgetting the crumbling of her own neighborhood . Mrs. Pack , adoring as she was , was often the object of Rita 's and Grim 's jokes . They laughed about her shaving , her wood-chopping strength . They wondered if she was n't a man . When they learned she and Kip had survived the violent break-in , Rita had said , " Well , that was a very close shave . " " Yeah , " said Grim . " Despite the hairs on their chinny chin-chins . " Mayes was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to eat sliced-turkey sandwiches . He said , " Show some respect . They have faced enough . You know it 's been rough on them . " Rita snickered . They sprawled laughing all over the kitchen . From Grim 's seat beside Kip , he saw her smile . He wondered if Rita had noticed a small glass eye stuck in the shiny handle of the cypress cane Kip kept tucked to his plastic thigh , but Rita was staring out the window . Grim gazed down at the cane . " It 's a seeing-eye stick , " Kip exclaimed . " Huh ? Pretty ai n't it ? Strong and light . A friend of mine made it . It can see for me , see ? Heh-heh . " He brushed his thumb over the thick pupil . Rita turned to look into the backseat . Kip held up the stick . " ' Cause I 'm a shell of the man . " Rita smiled . The stick was hideous . She thought about her early days with Mayes when he used to press her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , they had gone to a math-and-science conference in St. Augustine . After the closing banquet they walked the short beach behind the hotel where stray gulls and herons scavenged along the broken seawall . When he escorted her back to her door , he leaned in to her and kissed her . He was heavy and warm . He touched her face . He smelled like citrus and smoke . The next morning he sent a poem to her room , a stanza about his pressing against her , their palms together , and a strutting , white , long-necked bird pulling the beach as if it were a foaming blue cape . There was a gold moon with glittering minarets spinning around it , and light coursing through their bodies in the wild bent pattern of lightning She was feeling that lightning now . She felt charged , ready to leap out of the car . A pretty glade was going by , a couple of quick , black-winged yellow birds zipping low to the ground . Kip said , " Now that 's a beautiful property , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ca n't you imagine a doublewide set back up in there ? " Much later Rita told Grim what she had been thinking then . She had long wanted Grim to become an architect , maybe build Mayes 's city ringing the moon , and Kip 's dream about a double-wide was both ludicrously diminishing and touchingly sincere . She wanted to haul Grim away from there at the same time as she wanted him to value what Kip and Lola Pack were . It did n't take long to get to town . Mrs. Pack parked in a small open-air municipal lot . Approaching Main Street , Rita moved with her usual quick purpose , her thick ponytail swinging . Mrs. Pack pointed out the Korean-run wig shops in the old Woolworth and Walgreen buildings . " Everything 's different . " Kip and Grim lagged behind , Kip not used to his new leg . At one point he stopped , made the leg bend , and picked up a penny from the ground . " That 's why I 'm lucky . My good-for-shit nephew is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't think an old man like me could do it , did you ? " Percussive music with very high treble seemed to block the sidewalk ahead of them . Two smiling brown , silk-haired women -- one with the red dot on her forehead and both in saris -- stood on the sidewalk by a rack of brilliantly colored silk scarves . Sandalwood perfumed their doorway . Next door was the Western shop where Grim had a fringed , buckskin jacket on lay-a-way . He wondered now if he might exchange it for one of the spring Stetson straw hats on window display , or a pair of the hand-tooled boots propped by the bale of hay . The hot-dog place Rita remembered no longer sold hot dogs ; the new people served grinders . There were five customers , all at one table . A woman came from the back with four menus and offered smoking or nonsmoking . Mrs. Pack could n't understand what exactly a grinder was , what she would be eating . She looked to Kip , who shrugged , as if to remind her he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe we 'll come back , " Rita said . " We 're touring . " She giggled . They did look like tourists , she thought . Grim had on a red-and-white seersucker shirt and khaki pants . He and Kip wore clean white tennis shoes . Mrs. Pack had changed her jeans for white pants , and Rita wore a yellow checked jumper and carried a straw pocketbook . They were taking spring seriously , way too clean and pressed for downtown , where absolutely nothing was happening . Kip had another idea for where to find hot dogs . Back on the street a police car cruised by , followed by a short line of creeping cars . From a red GTO a dark fat kid yelled , " Hey , Mr. Kip , I hear you had a heart attack ! " Kip yelled back , " It was n't no heart attack ! " " Do I look like I had a heart attack ? " he asked Mrs. Pack . " It was a fight ! " he yelled again to the kid in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a slickster who signed his papers " Belly Man " and who had to be reminded to remove his hat in class . He made decent grades . He slumped now way down in the driver 's seat , which was leaned so far back that his thick head was visible through the back passenger window . He winked at Rita . " Now there 's a hot dog , " Mrs. Pack said . " Taking that gangster lean too far , " Rita said . " I bet he rolls like a muntain , " Mrs. Pack whispered to Rita . " I 'll bet so , too . " Rita laughed . " O.K. , that 's it , " Kip said . " All the action for the day . " They made it to Mint Street and stood at an interaction across from a mirrored one-story building . It had green-striped awnings and a lit red neon sign : All Points Grill . " Frankfurters ? " Grim asked . " Could be . " " What did it used to be , Kip ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Rita said . " Always a restaurant , right , Kip ? " " You know I ai n't what I was , " Kip said , now disavowing his own idea . Rita and Mrs. Pack rolled their eyes . Their wavering reflections grew from small to large as they all approached the mirrored windows . Mrs. Pack hesitated at the door . " This looks like another white folks ' place . " But Rita went on in . It was a white folks ' place , mostly . Frazzled , worn-out-looking drunks sat at round and square tables . Nobody had food on the table . Everybody was drinking sixteen-ounce cans of beer . A Patsy Cline record lamented achingly from the jukebox . An interracial couple -- white man , black woman -- hunched over Pabst cans at a square two-seater catching sun at the wide window . They had seen Rita 's party coming . But could they have thought they would come in ? Or cared ? This place was for sockless , shoelaceless people who smoked too-short cigarettes pinched to their lips . From behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barked , " Nemo ! " Near the door a despondent-looking redheaded white man came to sudden life . He scrambled to clear cans and plastic cups from a table for four . He pulled a white towel from inside his thin yellow shirt and wiped down the tabletop , then scuttled around to pull back the wooden chairs . He slapped the seats with the towel and jerked his hand at Rita . Nemo brought over narrow , red laminated menus . He hovered there holding a pad and pencil until the barman called " Nemo " again . He pivoted away , stuffed the pad into his back pocket and began clearing empties from other people 's tables . The menu featured regular dogs , chili dogs , and footlongs ; plus chuck wagons , fresh frozen fish fillets , famous burgers , chicken sandwiches , and soup de jour . " They got stuff , " Kip said , pleased . Rita looked around with an odd expression of dazed excitement , as if a new kind of happiness was about to erupt . Something about the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filmy light through the mirrored windows , was making her smile so hard she could have been biting something . " Are you O.K. ? " Grim asked her . " Man , this is some place , " she said , the sound coming from deep in her throat . A huge industrial floor fan oscillated against one wall . Rita could feel the buzz in her veins , as if the atoms of her blood vibrated . She felt as if she were riding in a fast-ascending elevator , a sudden emptiness in her stomach . She was quietly amazed that she was sitting still , grinning at the notion that nothing but the blades of the fan was moving much at all . Kip 's eyes suddenly hurt her . They were rheumy as egg yolks , like the other customers ' . With his bandages and the damaged quality of the drinkers ' faces , he looked like he belonged there . Mrs. Pack stared at the menu with tired age in her eyes . The black woman by the window had a bandaged ear -- cotton gauze held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar wore a dirty unsigned arm cast . He had a hump in his back . " Whoo , this place is on fire , " Rita said , catching a note near to her nightmare wail . Nemo was back with his pad , and Rita dazzled with questions . " What kind of meat is a chuck wagon ? " " Ma'am ? " " Your chilly dogs caught in the same frozen lake as your fish cubes ? " " Huh ? " " How long is your footlong ? " He held up his hands . " About this long . " " Let me see it . Never mind -- what 's so chicken about your sandwiches ? What are they afraid of ? What despicable things do you do to them , make them do ? And just what is your soup de jour ? " " Oh , well , see we do n't have no soup de jour today . " Rita laughed as if it was the funniest thing she had heard . " You do n't ? " " We had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rita said , standing up , looking much too wide-eyed . " Rita , what 's the matter ? " Grim asked . She knew she did n't mean it , that she was acting like someone else . She was just thinking and feeling things so fast . " You 're a famous burger , my friend , " she said to Nemo . She sat , surprised to be breathing hard . Kip and Mrs. Pack stared at her . Then , when Rita was quiet , grinning , Kip told Nemo to bring a round of dogs and sweet iced tea . These sad drunks , Rita thought . Those moon-eyed boys at home . She was trying to make her eyes as wide as theirs , late-night by the barrel fire . " What are they looking at , Grim ? " She took his hand and stroked it . Her face relaxed , her eyes going soft . " I want to see it for you . " " Oh , Grim , " she said , deep in love with him now , Patsy Cline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your name , sweetheart . " " Sis . " He looked anxiously at her , and then at Kip and Mrs. Pack . They looked anxious , too . " This is all so real right now , " Rita said , laughing , her mood changing again . Her hand was like a soft machine on the back of Grim 's hand . " I 'm feeling sick , honey . I have to tell you that . Things are not exactly right ; I know that . But it is so much more real . " She looked at him tenderly , like a mother , or a lover , her eyes not letting him go . " You are the most beautiful boy . I want to roll you up inside and keep you there . " She held him a few seconds longer , then quickly released him . " Maybe I swallowed that fly leg , stupid thing . " She laughed . She got up from the table and headed for the bathroom . Her ponytail swung like a snapped cable as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right , " Mrs. Pack said . " I 'll go see about her in a minute . " " Your sister is a saint , boy . You can see that , I hope . " " Well , " Mrs. Pack said , " doing everything she does . Does she sleep ? " Grim ignored them . This had happened before , a few years ago . He remembered how she had seemed to him then , as two Ritas , one inexactly laid over the other . Their aunt Ruth had to come take care of him then , and soon Rita had come back , after how long ? A stay in a hospital , and he had forgotten to be afraid , and now he was again . Mayes should be here , he thought , angry at him . He hoped she would bring herself back in focus in the bathroom , but knew it could n't happen like that . And soon he would have to go in and get her -- not Mrs. Pack . Rita leaned over the commode and watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long joking for the fly 's leg to leap on out of her . She had to get Grim out of there . She had things to do , people to pee , she said to herself . If things did n't happen as fast as she saw them she was going to burst , bloating as she was , float up and burst , disperse in a spray of sparks . She needed to calm down and see Mayes . He could help . He 'd see immediately that something was wrong , that this was the happiest she had been in years .
