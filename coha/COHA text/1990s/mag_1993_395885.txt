The modern motorhome is the fullest expression of a remarkable American invention : the self-contained fully-equipped base camp on wheels . These recreational vehicles give you the freedom to stay where you want in complete comfort , and allow you to be on the spot to get a jump on the day without making a long drive from home or a motel at a ridiculously early hour . Motorhomes come in a wide variety of sizes and models , but the best choice for most sportsmen is a Class C , the so-called " mini motorhome . " Class C motorhomes are less expensive than the larger Class A motorhomes , but still offer complete sleeping , bathing , meal preparation , dining , and lounging facilities . In addition , the rig is nimble enough so you can drive it down narrow dirt lanes to reach your campsite , yet strong enough to tow along a fishing boat , utility trailer , or 4WD vehicle . Because a Class C is built on a standard van-type or pickup chassis , the driver 's area can be familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreational vehicle . Conventional big-block and small-block gasoline engines , as well as diesel engines , make vehicle operation and maintenance easy to manage . A motorhome fitted with a big-block engine such as a Chevy 454 or Ford 460 is a better choice for those who plan on towing a large trailer or a heavy bass boat . It 's good to keep your intended driving destinations in mind when looking at Class Cs of different lengths . A shorter unit may have somewhat less interior space , but it may be a lot easier to tuck into tight out-of-the-way places . Most Class Cs are equipped with a large bed in the cabover area . This bed can sleep two very full-size adults with ease , and will fit tall people due to its wall-to-wall design . Full-size Class C coach bodies are 7-1/2 to 8 feet wide , so even if the cabover bed has a small cabinet near the head or foot , it still has plenty of sleeping space . Interior features such as the sofa and standard RV-style dinette can usually be converted into beds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small side . There 's not a lot of difference between the galleys on Class C motorhomes , apart from their physical floorplan arrangements . Most feature a four-burner stove ; a refrigerator that works on 12-volt DC , propane , and/or 110-volt AC ; and a single- or dual-bowl sink . A microwave oven and in-counter food processor are among the kitchen-area options . The best bet is to use a rig with the largest refrigerator possible ; the smaller ones always seem to fill up too fast . Make sure the fridge can work on propane , because that 's the best fuel for long-term dry camping ( without electric or water hookups ) . In recent years RV manufacturers have been concentrating a lot more on providing practical , functional storage space . Some models are built with the floor raised a few inches from the chassis frame rails , which allows the builder to incorporate pass-though basement-type storage compartments with access through lower-sidewall exterior doors . These compartments can accommodate fishing rods up to 7 feet 9 inches long without bending ; longer rods can be accommodated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be stashed in cabinets located along the upper walls of the coach . During the day , sleeping bags , luggage , and other gear can be piled on the forward bunk so the rest of the rig is available for dining and lounging . Most motorhomes are built with some tall hanging-clothes closets , but dimensions vary widely from a few inches to a couple of feet of linear rod space . Such a closet would be important if you have raingear , waders , or other items you do n't want scrunched into a ball at the bottom . If the storage compartments ca n't take your extra-long rods , you could install a commercially available rod holder somewhere on the RV 's ceiling where there are plenty of long , open spaces . Today 's modern RVs are equipped with thermostat-regulated forced-air furnaces as effortless to operate as the ones we use at home . Keeping warm is simply a matter of setting the thermostat at the desired temperature , and letting the unit 's automatic-ignition and shut-down features do the rest . Air-conditioning is an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thermostat-control is optionally available on some models , but most A/C units must be manually turned on and off . Some of the better-quality units feature fully enclosed and heated holding tanks . This feature allows you to use the rig in sub-freezing weather without fear of ending up with a frozen-solid water system . Some have only a freeze-proof freshwater tank , which will at least keep you going , but you may have problems dumping the black- and gray-water waste tanks after the trip if they 've been exposed to the elements and have frozen . Most RVs are insulated to an R-factor of at least 5 to 7 , compared to 11 to 16 or more for a residence , so they are n't as efficient as a house at keeping the cold out . They 're a darn sight better than a tent , though , and an RV will keep you toasty on a night that sends a hardy tenter leaping for long johns and a minus-zero-rated down-insulated bag .

OPTIONS * If you enjoy the luxury of special-ordering your Class C , you might keep a few sportsman-friendly options in mind . For example , most RVs are floored with a combination of carpet , vinyl , and/or hardwood of such as oak parquet . For a truly durable floor , omit the carpet and hardwood and stick with the vinyl . An all-vinyl floor stands up best to muddy boots and dogs . Portable area rugs can keep your bare feet from freezing on cold mornings , and are easily removed for cleaning . If you plan to be in the field during very cold weather , opt for the largest furnace available . It 's easier to start with a big one than it is to upgrade later . Some manufacturers also offer an extra-insulation package , which is a wise investment . Jalousie windows , which feature several narrow horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the bottom , are a good choice if you live in a wet climate . Due to their overlapping design , jalousie windows can be left open when it 's raining without getting the coach interior wet , and allow air circulation that helps both to dry wet clothes and to keep you more comfortable . For long-term dry camping , choose the largest fresh- and waste-water holding tank available . A few manufacturers will even install larger units than those shown in the catalogs if so desired . An awning provides a dry area next to the coach when it 's raining , and an open-air bit of shade in the summer . Having that dry area where you can remove waterlogged coats and such without getting even wetter or taking the wet garments inside is very handy . It also helps minimize the mud you track inside . Many aftermarket companies have permanently mountable solar-cell battery charging systems available . These units do a good job of trickle-charging a battery during the day to replace what you used at night , which can further extend your stay away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest , most heavy-duty deep-cycle coach battery you can fit in the unit . If the battery box size makes it physically possible , using two of these batteries in parallel will extend your camping time dramatically . If you 're in a cold climate where the high-current-drain furnace runs a lot , adequate electricity is a must . For the ultimate in 12-volt power , use a pair of 6-volt deep-cycle batteries of the type used for golf carts and other heavy-duty-cycle applications , connected in series to provide a long-lasting power supply . THE COST OF FREEDOM * Purchasing a motorhome is a hefty investment . A new lower-end Class C in the 18- to 22-foot range may cost between $25,000 to $30,000 , depending on optional equipment . Higher-end units in the 26- to 30-foot range can be priced as high as $45,000 . A few top-end Class C units go out the door for $50,000 or more , but these are the exceptions . Used coaches can be had for $10,000 or less , depending on their condition , age , and other factors that affect any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for most of the living-area equipment , such as the refrigerator , furnace , water pump , and so on , in an older RV . Rental units are also an option . <p>
