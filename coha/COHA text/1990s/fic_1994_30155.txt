ONE On the morning the last Lisbon daughter took her turn at suicide-it was Mary this time , and sleeping pills , like Therese-the two paramedics arrived at the house knowing exactly where the knife drawer was , and the gas oven , and the beam in the basement from which it was possible to lie a rope . They got out of the EMS truck , as usual moving much too slowly in our opinion , and the fat one said under his breath , " This ai n't TV , folks , this is how fast we go . " He was carrying the heavy respirator and cardiac unit past the bushes that had grown monstrous and over the erupting lawn , tame and immaculate thirteen months earlier when the trouble began . Cecilia , the youngest , only thirteen , had gone first , slitting her wrists like a Stoic while taking a bath , and when they found her , afloat in her pink pool , with the yellow eyes of someone possessed and her small body giving off the odor of a mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tranquillity that they had stood mesmerized . But then Mrs. Lisbon lunged in , screaming , and the reality of the room reasserted itself : blood on the bath mat ; Mr. Lisbon 's razor sunk in the toilet bowl , marbling the water . The paramedics fetched Cecilia out of the warm water because it quickened the bleeding , and put a tourniquet on her arm . Her wet hair hung down her back and already her extremities were blue . She did n't say a word , but when they parted her hands they found the laminated picture of the Virgin Mary she held against her budding chest . That was in June , fish-fly season , when each year our town is covered by the flotsam of those ephemeral insects . Rising in clouds from the algae in the polluted lake , they blacken windows , coat cars and street-lamps , plaster the municipal docks and festoon the rigging of sailboats , always in the same brown ubiquity of flying scum . Mrs. Scheer , who lives down the street , told us she saw Cecilia the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curb , in the antique wedding dress with the shorn hem she always wore , looking at a Thunderbird encased in fish flies . " You better get a broom , honey , " Mrs. Scheer advised . But Cecilia fixed her with her spiritualist 's gaze . " They 're dead , " she said . " They only live twenty-four hours . They hatch , they reproduce , and then they croak . They do n't even get to eat . " ' And with that she stuck her hand into the foamy layer of bugs and cleared her initials : C.L. We 've tried to arrange the photographs chronologically , though the passage of so many years has made it difficult . A few are fuzzy but revealing nonetheless . Exhibit #1 shows the Lisbon house shortly before Cecilia 's suicide attempt . It was taken by a real estate agent , Ms. Carmina D'Angelo , whom Mr. Lisbon had hired to sell the house his large family had long outgrown . As the snapshot shows , the slate roof had not yet begun to shed its shingles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the windows were not yet held together with strips of masking tape . A comfortable suburban home . The upper-right second-story window contains a blur that Mrs. Lisbon identified as Mary Lisbon . " She used to tease her hair because she thought it was limp , " she said years later , recalling how her daughter had looked for her brief time on earth . In the photograph Mary is caught in the act of blow-drying her hair . Her head appears to be on fire but that is only a trick of the light . It was June 13 , eighty-three degrees out , under sunny skies . * When the paramedics were satisfied they had reduced the bleeding to a trickle , they put Cecilia on a stretcher and carried her out of the house to the truck in the driveway . She looked like a tiny Cleopatra on an imperial litter . We saw the gangly paramedic with the Wyatt Earp mustache come out first-the one we 'd call " Sheriff " when we got to know him better through these domestic tragedies-and then the fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stepping daintily across the lawn , peering at his police-issue shoes as though looking out for dog shit , though later , when we were better acquainted with the machinery , we knew he was checking the blood pressure gauge . Sweating and fumbling , they moved toward the shuddering , blinking truck . The fat one tripped on a lone croquet wicket . In revenge he kicked it ; the wicket sprang loose , plucking up a spray of dirt , and fell with a ping on the driveway . Meanwhile , Mrs. Lisbon burst onto the porch , trailing Cecilia 's flannel nightgown , and let out a long wail that stopped time . Under the molting trees and above the blazing , overexposed grass those four figures paused in tableau : the two slaves offering the victim to the altar ( lifting the stretcher into the truck ) , the priestess brandishing the torch ( waving the flannel nightgown ) , and the drugged virgin rising up on her elbows , with an otherworldly smile on her pale lips . Mrs. Lisbon rode in the bark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station wagon , observing the speed limit . Two of the Lisbon daughters were away from home , Therese in Pittsburgh at a science convention , and Bonnie at music camp , trying to learn the flute after giving up the piano ( her hands were too small ) , the violin ( her chin hurt ) , the guitar ( her fingertips bled ) , and the trumpet ( her upper lip swelled ) . Mary and Lux , hearing the siren , had run home from their voice lesson across the street with Mr. Jessup . Barging into that crowded bathroom , they registered the same shock as their parents at the sight of Cecilia with her spattered forearms and pagan nudity . Outside , they hugged on a patch of uncut grass that Butch , the brawny boy who mowed it on Saturdays , had missed . Across the street , a truckful of men from the Parks Department attended to some of our dying elms . The EMS siren shrieked , going away , and botanist and his crew withdrew their insecticide to watch the truck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stately elm tree , also visible in the foreground of Exhibit #1 , has since succumbed to the fungus spread by Dutch elm beetles , has been cut down . The paramedics took Cecilia to Bon Secours Hospital on Kercheval and Maumee . In the emergency room Cecilia watched the attempt to save her life with an eerie detachment . Her yellow eyes did n't blink , nor did she flinch when they stuck a needle in her arm . Dr. Armonson stitched up her wrist wounds . Within five minutes of the transfusion he declared her out of danger . Chucking her under her chin , he said , " What are you doing here , honey ? You 're not even old enough to know how bad life gets . " And it was then Cecilia gave orally what was to be her only form of suicide note , and a useless one at that , because she was going to live : Obviously , Doctor , she said , " you 've never been a thirteen-year-old girl . " * The Lisbon girls were thirteen ( Cecilia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Bonnie ) , and sixteen ( Mary ) , and seventeen ( Therese ) . They were short , round-buttocked in denim , with roundish cheeks that recalled that same dorsal softness . Whenever we got a glimpse , their faces looked indecently revealed , as though we were used to seeing women in veils . No one could understand how Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon had produced such beautiful children . Mr. Lisbon taught high-school math . He was thin , boyish , stunned by his own gray hair . He had a high voice , and when Joe Larson told us how Mr. Lisbon had cried when Lux was later rushed to the hospital during her own suicide scare , we could easily imagine the sound of his girlish weeping . Whenever we saw Mrs. Lisbon we looked in vain for some sign of the beauty that must have once been hers . But the plump arms , the brutally cut steel-wool hair , and the librarian 's glasses foiled us every time . We saw her only rarely , in the morning , fully dressed though the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dewy milk cartons , or on Sundays when the family drove in their paneled station wagon to St. Paul 's Catholic Church on the Lake . On those mornings Mrs. Lisbon assumed a queenly iciness . Clutching her good purse , she checked each daughter for signs of makeup before allowing her to get in the car , and it was not unusual for her to send Lux back inside to put on a less revealing top . None of us went to church , so we had a lot of time to watch them , the two parents leached of color , like photographic negatives , and then the five glittering daughters in their homemade dresses , all lace and ruffle , bursting with their fructifying flesh . Only one boy had ever been allowed in the house . Peter Sissen had helped Mr. Lisbon install a working model of the solar system in his classroom at school , and in return Mr. Lisbon had invited him for dinner . He told us the girls had kicked him continually under the table , from every direction , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gazed at him with their blue febrile eyes and smiled , showing their crowded teeth , the only feature of the Liabon girls we could ever find fault with . Bonnie was the only one who did n't give Peter Sissen a secret look or kick . She only said grace and ate her food silently , lost in the piety of a fifteen-year-old . After the meal Peter Sissen asked to go to the bathroom , and because Therese and Mary were both in the downstairs one , giggling and whispering , he had to use the girls ' , upstairs . He came back to us with stories of bedrooms filled with crumpled panties , of stuffed animals hugged to death by the passion of the girls , of a crucifix draped with a brassiere , of gauzy chambers of canopied beds , and of the effluvia of so many young girls becoming women together in the same cramped space . In the bathroom , running the faucet to cloak the sounds of his search , Peter Sissen found Mary Lisbon 's secret cache of cosmetics tied up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the second skin of blush and base , and the depilatory wax that informed us she had a mustache we had never seen . In fact , we did n't know whose makeup Peter Sissen had found until we saw Mary Lisbon two weeks later on the pier with a crimson mouth that matched the shade of his descriptions .
