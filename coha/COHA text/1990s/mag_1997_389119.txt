KEEP THE FAITH . THE RIGHT RELA TIONSHIP IS WITHIN REACH ! HERE 'S HOW TO PREPARE YOURSELF TO RECEIVE THE LOVE YOU DESERVE // It 's through trial and error that many of us find our way through the mysterious maze that leads to love . But what if over the years the trials and errors only mount , and you still feel no closer to getting the relationship you yearn for ? The universe may be whispering for you to cut a different path . ESSENCE invited three leading thinkers to come together and share their best advice on how each of us can begin the inner journey that readies us for the love we deserve . Iyanla Vanzant , a popular motivational speaker , is the best-selling author of several books , including The Spirit of a Man : A Vision of Transformation for Black Men and the Women Who Love Them ( HarperSanFrancisco ) . Psychotherapist and self-esteem expert Julia A. Boyd is the author of Embracing the Fire : Sisters Talk About Relationships ( Dutton ) . And Minister Ava Muhammad , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most prominent leaders , is the author of two books , including Real Love ( LoveKare Productions ) . In this discussion , moderated by Diane Weathers and Tara Roberts , Vanzant , Boyd and Muhammad explore issues sure to make you reexamine your beliefs , reassess your values and reignite your dreams . If you 've been feeling stuck in the area of love relationships , prepare for a breakthrough . First , Master the Art of Being Alone Muhammad : I believe that in everyone 's life , God intends for us to be alone at some point . Whether it 's when you 're young or middleaged or older , He is going to let you be by yourself so you will know Him . Vanzant : But do n't be afraid of that . Muhammad : You can find joy in it , because when you are alone , you are enveloped in a creative process that can not be had when you are with someone else . And the more you 're able to be with yourself comfortably , the more at ease you D can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't have a meaningful discussion about a relationship with a man until we have a dialogue with the self and with God . If you are secure about who you are , you 're less inclined to project feelings of inadequacy onto the other person . We also have to guard against making the partner in the relationship our god , so that we 're not looking to the partner for things we should seek from the Creator . Vanzant : Right . We 've got to be willing to be by ourselves for the rest of our lives . And be happy and awaken to our God selves , doing what brings us joy in the glory of God from this day until we die . And if we are willing to do that , I guarantee you that the brother will show up . Muhammad : Just because you do n't see him in the halls at work , do n't freak out . It 's very important that we develop patience , which evolves only through suffering and restraint . We can not put God on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will never get married or never find a beautiful relationship . Vanzant : Age ai n't nothing but a number . Muhammad : Exactly . I was 38 and my husband was 30 when we got married . So I was a good 15 to 18 years beyond what my social circle considered the right age . I think that the notion of a " right time " is a big enemy of Black women . Getting the Love You Need Boyd : When I 'm looking for a long-term relationship , I know I 've got to build a foundation first . That means finding out if the other person is looking for that , too . That means taking my time to get to know the other person . And letting him know me . Vanzant : I think we must move in life from a place of love , which does n't mean I have to live with you , sleep with you , have your babies . But if I can just love you and give you the space to be yourself , then maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But if you want cake , you first have to know what kind of cake you want , and then you get all the ingredients , and then you mix and you bake . A lot of us are so hungry for cake that we settle for cookies . Vanzant : Some of us give sensations the reverence of love : Boy , he 's great in bed . I love him . Or I love him . He always buys me everything . But when we touch into unconditional love , it takes away those " junk food " yearnings . So when your mate shows up , there 's no question ! This is it ! Muhammad : We have to find out a man 's values . When seeing a person , ask him , " What do you want out of life ? Where do you see yourself in five years ? " Vanzant : " What is your vision ... " Muhammad : " ... for yourself in ten years ? " And listen ! Boyd : When I 've been dating someone a while and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How do you deal with your anger ? Because I know if we 're going to be together any length of time , you will get angry at me , and I 'm going to tell you how I deal with mine . " And a red flag for me is if he says , " Well , you 'll find out when it happens " or " I do n't know . " Right ? The one that really makes my hair stand on end is " I do n't get angry , " " cause I know that 's a lie . If he knows and he 's clear about how he handles his anger , he 's also clear about other key aspects of himself . Vanzant : Yes . And in relationships , two other areas are key . One , how do we make decisions ? We go into relationships without a decision-making process in place so we 're in conflict and competition when decisions must be made . Two , what 's the process of resolving conflict ? We need to discuss that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let 's also get together with some family members-on both sides . Whether they were adoptive parents , whether it was CONTINUED ON PAGE 118 an institution-go to where your mate comes from and learn about those early experiences . Were they happy ? Miserable ? What effect did they have on him ? Those are the components of this person you 're about to connect with . Photograph The participants : center , Iyanla Vanzant ; top , Julia A. Boyd ; at right , Minister Ava Muhammad . // Mistakes Women Make Muhammad : Women say , " I know I 've got a good man " cause I can trust him . " But you must also earn his trust . If you can be trusted , you 'll attract someone trustworthy . If we focus on elevating our own character , then just as water seeks its own level , we will actually develop a force field around us that eliminates or drastically reduces the number of negative people . Vanzant : That 's right . Not only must we be trustworthy , but I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Vanzant : When your life is working , it is not a dramatic production . We have to break our addiction to drama and crisis . And we have to stop competing . You know , I 'm more wounded than he is or I need more than he does . We all came over here on the same boat , and for the most part , we both have the same issues and the same challenges . Boyd : Part of our blessing as females is to nurture , which does n't mean doing everything for a man . But we can listen to him , and we can support him emotionally . I think part of what happens in our partnerships is we 're so busy trying to take care of everything , fix everything , that we forget ourselves , lose ourselves-very comfortably , sometimes . We also zone out on parts of ourselves we 're not happy with . But we have to embrace and validate those parts too . Muhammad : Sometimes we try to overwhelm him with the idea that " I am everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually devalue ourselves . But we have to be constantly aware of the give-and-take of the relationship . If you give , you will receive . That 's a divine law . So if you 're giving and you 're not receiving , there 's a problem . As women , we must also show appreciation for one another . This will help us overcome bitter feelings we harbor . We have to uplift and exalt each othereven when we 're not in each other 's presence , because we 're not going to be the beneficiary of a true , loving relationship until we have a sisterhood . Vanzant : That 's true . I can not let anybody tear down Sister Ava . Ca n't let anybody tear down Julia . . . Boyd : And I ca n't let anybody tear you all down . Muhammad : Right . Vanzant : And we have to get to the point that when we hear it coming , we say , " Excuse me , not in my presence . " Muhammad : And for some people it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're angry , we feel rejected and despised . So for a lot of us it will be hard to open up and say of another woman , " Yes , she 's beautiful ; she 's intelligent . " But this is important for us , and for influencing men to upgrade their perception of females . Barriers to Intimacy Vanzant : I think that one of the things we have to do is create a space for a man in our lives . I was getting ready to get married , and I was like , Where s he going to put his clothes ? He 's going to have to put his clothes in the basement , because I 'm not moving out my stuff . Was n't any space in the bathroom ; I had the whole counter . I was about to marry this man , and I had n't really created a space for him in my life . Muhammad : You know , we have been repressed and oppressed for so many centuries that now , as we are finally coming into a period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fear of being silenced and repressed again , which makes us resist and reject anything that looks like it 's going to take control of us or take CONTINUED ON PACE 120 advantage of us . Boyd : Oftentimes we make the mistake of thinking that our man will respond the same way we would respond . So a woman will think , I 'm going to say this , that and the other . And when I 'm finished , he is going to understand what he has to do to make this right . But what we imagine he 'll do is how we would respond . Vanzant : And we get mad when he does n't respond the way we would . Boyd : And we call that honest communication ! Muhammad : We have to acknowledge that we sometimes have a damaged perception of reality , which impedes our ability to develop a healthy , committed relationship . We actually drive the person away because we 're fearful and insecure . Boyd : Not only do we have to make room in our lives for men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can agree to disagree without hurting and trashing each other . We have to learn to be less defensive , to listen to what they say-before we respond . How to Get What You Want Muhammad : Communicate . Be honest . Vanzant : Tell him , " Lower , slower , a little to the left ! " Whatever it is ! Otherwise , you 're not going to get it . And if you have n't asked for it and you do n't get it , you ca n't be angry . Often in relationships we 're angry about not getting what we want and need , yet we have n't asked for it . Muhammad : Which is really insane . Vanzant : We have to ask and get clear . But we have become afraid of asking for what we want , and of letting go if a relationship does n't honor us . If you want it , you 've got to be willing not to have it for as long as it takes , until it comes in a way that is honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy out of your brain wanting someone . But you have to develop your own personal , intimate moments so that you 're not sex-starved and sexcrazy , and you still know how to say no . The Time for Physical Intimacy Vanzant : I say hold out for 90 days . I think that it is so critical to develop tive ways of nonsexual love and nonverbal expressions of intimacy . For instance , you could sit with your hand on a man 's shoulder for two hours and watch a movie and get up and go home . That way you start to touch them in ways that give them sensations and feelings above the waist . You know ? Nonverbal , nonsexual expressions of love and intimacy . This is important for us if we are to feel safe and honest in each other 's company . Boyd : But the other part of it is that if you know you want to go with the sexual , you have to be clear that that 's what you want . If you want to meet that need , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , and we have choices as to whether or not we act on those needs . Muhammad : There 's a lot of talk around about men being dogs . But one thing I do n't think we fully appreciate is the depths of the male need for physical contact with the female . We tend to equate this drive for physical contact with He 's in love with me . And all I 'm saying is , when it turns out that it 's not for life , then we are hurt , and we can , after a number of these experiences , build up a general dislike for men . So that when the right one does come , you are so hostile and have built so many walls to protect yourself that you ca n't break through . Vanzant : People always ask me , " How will I know when it 's time ? " A part of me wants to say , " You will know . " And the other part of me wants to say , " Even if you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you 're forgiving . . . " Muhammad : If you 're trusting . . . Vanzant : If you 're in your power . . . Muhammad : Yes , teach . Vanzant : If you 're balanced , centered , listening , if you 're in alignment , then even if he ai n't the one , you 'll come out of it okay . But sometimes we accept someone who is n't " the one " because we 're so desperate to be needed . Muhammad : We have to guard against mediocrity . Honor and Respect Vanzant : If he expects to honor you , he honors you from day one . Muhammad : Right . From day one . Boyd : On every level . Vanzant : If he respects you , he respects you on day one . And when things do n't happen , you 'll feel it . We let them lie to us and then we call them liars . Boyd : I 'm not in a relationship right now , but I want a relationship . And I 'm real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't respect that person , this is not going to develop into a long-term relationship . If I do n't feel I can trust this person , it 's not going to go anywhere . I need those two things to build love . I ca n't go into something expecting those things will manifest themselves later . I tell women the only chance for you to change a man is when he 's in diapers . Muhammad : I love it . Boyd : You do n't change anybody . They 're responsible for changing themselves . If you go into it , and you see all these red flags and you put on your sunglasses and think it 's cool , you 're fooling yourself On Growing in Love Muhammad : We 're not taught in this society to correct problems . We 're taught to run away from them . Struggle is ordained by God to make us grow . So every time we turn away from difficulty , there 's a deterioration in character ... Vanzant : You 're stunting your own growth . Muhammad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we go into a relationship with our luggage sitting in the hall . And we say to ourselves , well , if it 's not right , I 'll go live with Susie . We have a plan B , what we 'll do when this does not work or we get tired . We abandon ship before we reap the rewards , and then we call it a failure when , in fact , we turned away from it just before it reached its fullness . It 's going through the deaths in the family , the economic hardships , the illnesses , the trial of trying to have children that lets you form a bond that makes you defenders of each other . Boyd : Sometimes people do grow apart , though-not for lack of love but because they 've grown in different ways . The other part of the equation is that sometimes it 's not your luggage sitting in the hall . But I 'd say the key point in growing in love is being able to talk openly and honestly about the process ; couples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone should be like , but they 've never discussed it with each other . On Staying in Love Vanzant : Older couples did n't have leaving as an option-like we do . I 'm in my mid-forties . When I was growing up , you got a pair of stockings and you washed them and CONTINUED ON PAGE123 you hung them up and you were very careful with them . Muhammad : Right , you did n't throw them away . Vanzant : Now we got 99-cent pantyhose , so we just throw " em away . And a lot of times , that 's what we do with our relationships too , because we do n't understand that a relationship is where you go to heal . That 's where your stuff will come up . That man or that mate is going to bring up stuff in you that you do n't even want to know about yourself . Muhammad : That 's right . Vanzant : But if you work on it and pray on it , you 're going to get through it . Boyd : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of romance and carving out time to be together . It does n't have to be elaborate-although that does n't hurt , either . I know one couple who 've been married 20 years and every evening they take a walk , holding hands . Often it 's the simple things we do together that help us make it through the tough times . <p>
