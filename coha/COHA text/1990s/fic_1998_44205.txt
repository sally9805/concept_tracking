I. <p> Television eats the soul . When I was a little girl we had a black-and-white TV . I was coloring in a coloring book . The picture showed a little girl in her bedroom , looking at herself in a mirror . I could n't remember whether a mirror showed your reflection in color or in black and white . I had to go to the mirror in the hall and look at myself to see . I was six years old , or maybe seven . I swear this is true . <p> From the time I was eleven until I left home to go to college I took art lessons of one kind or another , special lessons , always outside the regular classes at school . This started because my father showed some drawings I 'd done to a man he knew who taught painting at a university . The artist told him I had talent . He told him not to let my talent get ruined by the wrong kind of early training . <p> My first classes met on Saturdays in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher was a painter named Tony , a tall thin redheaded man with a little goatee . The other students were adults , mostly women my mother 's age , or older . Tony was younger than anyone in the class except me . <p> My father liked Tony and he liked the painting I did when Tony was my teacher . I learned to shade and contour , I learned to make round things round . I started with eggs and oranges , using charcoal , burnt sienna Conte crayon , black ink and blue paint ; then adding one color at a time I learned to handle watercolors , to indicate a figure in a few wet strokes-Tony 's wife , who came one day to model for us . I learned to make loose little sketches outdoors in front of a barn or boat landing or rundown warehouse in order to find the exact composition I wanted before starting to paint . Those days were the best , when we went out in a group to the beach or the marshy estuary and painted what we saw . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl from school walked by us and I felt ashamed to be seen . After that I was anxious when we went out , self-conscious , afraid to be caught again , carrying a tackle box full of tubes of color , setting up a board with paper and paint , hanging out with old people on a Saturday morning , doing anything so weird . <p> During the week , Tony worked for one of the aerospace companies , Lockheed or Hughes , and one morning he showed us a rocket painting he 'd done that was printed as an ad in Time magazine . He told me this was n't the kind of painting he liked to do , and I knew he did n't really like teaching us either , because after a year or so he left the class and another man came to teach us instead . <p> I studied with this other man a long time , mostly painting copies of his paintings , until he left us too . I do n't remember the other students in any of these classes , only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paint a still life that looked like a magazine layout for suntan lotion , I quit . <p> My father called Tony then and started me on private lessons . Every Saturday morning and Wednesday night he drove me to the crowded apartment in Venice where Tony lived with his wife and three babies , and after my father left , we went out landscape painting or on Wednesday nights to the garage that was Tony 's studio and worked on my technique . <p> I was fourteen , fifteen , I 'm not sure , when one Saturday in Tony 's car as we were driving back from the beach he told me he was getting divorced . I did n't know what to say . Suddenly he scared me . I did n't know why I was scared , whether it was the fact of his divorce or his telling me about it that made me suddenly vulnerable beside him . Vulnerable : what I mean is that the words made me , all fifteen , no-more-than-sixteen years of me , feel like a woman , all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anyone . Or they made him suddenly a man . I was afraid he was going to kiss me , ask something of me , expect something . I sat there stupidly , staring out the window . I did n't know what to say . <p> Do n't ever get married , he said . Do n't ever have babies . <p> I was inexperienced with boys . I had n't yet gone on the date with the fat boy with sweaty hands . I had n't yet spent Thanksgiving vacation making out with the first boy I thought I loved , letting him touch my bare breasts and stopping him from undoing my pants . When we got back to school , he would drop me without explanation , and I would n't know whether it was because I had let him touch my breasts or because I had n't let him touch the rest . Either way , he had a new girlfriend and would n't talk to me anymore . But none of that had happened yet , and I had n't yet made love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent the rest of the summer yearning for him while he dated a Catholic girl from Corona Del Mar who would n't put out . I did n't know anything . I 'd seen pictures of women 's breasts in Playboy magazine . I 'd seen diagrams of my own interior anatomy in pamphlets about menstruation . I understood intercourse only abstractly . Men were a mystery to me . <p> I stared out the car window at the traffic and franchise signs along the road . I waited for Tony to stop talking . When he did stop , we were both silent for a long time . <p> In some of those last lessons with him I did opaque still lifes in grays and blacks and whites : potatoes , a knife , and a saucepan-homely things , things from around his house . Then his wife and children moved out and he was gone . That day in the car I could feel my breasts inside my shirt , heavier than I ever knew them . I imagined he was in love with me . <p> At last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and he sounded angry . You ca n't help . I forgot how young you are . <p> But the truth was I had more knowledge than I knew . If I had been as empty of experience as I thought I was I might have answered Tony , might have told him I was sad for him , offered comfort , reached over , touched his hand , his shoulder-maybe I could have been the friend he wanted me to be , or even more . He was n't very old , in spite of his wife and three babies , and inside I was a girl who wanted to risk everything , a girl who could take his hand and say Now you can paint forever and ever , and I can paint with you , body to body , teach me , a girl with breasts that begged to be touched and lips to be kissed and a heart to be opened , we can drive away , go anywhere , I 'm not afraid . She was there with us in the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in black and white , in the windshield , in the gray sky . She was just like me . She was smoking . She was drinking bourbon . I swear this is true . <p> 2 . <p> Maybe you know these girls . They have names like Sheila , Loriann , and Jadine . They do n't all live in the trailer park but one of them does , and her mother , and because the trailer is where they liked to hang out , this is how you 've come to think of them . Maybe where you grew up it was n't a trailer park , but some other form of the wrong side of the tracks . It does n't matter . These girls had no father , or a father who sat around the trailer or apartment or ( but rarely ) the house all day , unshaven and wearing his undershirt . <p> Maybe you know Raynelle-she lived with her grandmother ? Who once upon a time had come to California to be a movie star and worked now at the phone company or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty , not even as old as your own mother maybe , who worked at Hughes and must have been in her late-mid-forties during those years . Raynelle 's grandmother-remember ? - had bleached hair and plucked-out eyebrows penciled in . You did n't meet her often-she was usually working . She had a beautiful voice on the phone-young and vaguely southern , almost like singing . She called you sugar when she answered the phone , but never in person . In person she never had much to say . She looked at you skeptically , like what 're you doing hanging around with a kid like mine ? <p> It was Mary Ann Mackey who lived in the trailer park . I do n't know anymore where it would have been exactly-in Inglewood probably , maybe off Manchester Boulevard , but I 'm not sure , and I 'm sure that trailer park is n't there now . It ca n't have been a very big trailer , but Mary Ann lived in it with her mother and stepfather , and her mother was never at home-she worked as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one in the daytime , one at night . Mary Ann 's stepfather played the horses , or sat home and drank . It might not be true that these girls liked to hang out at the trailer park . They hardly ever did , at least not when you were around . When you were around they mostly went to Debbie Lee Breight 's house . You called everything a house-your house , my house-but Debbie Breight 's was an apartment , on La Tijera Boulevard , the other side of the gully , back before the gully became the San Diego Freeway , when you still looked down at wildness anytime you crossed that bridge . <p> Debbie came from Canada and lived alone with her mother , who was divorced . Living alone with a divorced mother was unusual in that time and place , and maybe without knowing it , that was what I liked best about her . Otherwise , Debbie was fat , fatter than I was , and had blonde frizzed-out hair . Not the kind of fat that made you fear for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it that , no matter what , you 'd never let yourself get that big . You were n't so fat yourself yet , maybe never would be ( fat is relative but you did n't know that yet ) , and Debbie was the kind of fat that made a girl soft and round and sweet and to some boys even appealing at an age when the rest of us wore bras but still had nothing special to put in them . <p> Every day at lunch we got together-Raynelle , Mary Ann , and Debbie Breight , and me . We were brown-bag girls-this was junior high now , lunch boxes were strictly grade school-and we sat on benches , and in the sun and the smell and heat of the asphalt schoolyard , spreading out our grapes and bananas and waxed-paper bags , we traded cookies and sandwiches and told dirty jokes . <p> These jokes were n't particularly funny , and certainly not erotic , but for their extravagant punning on words we knew to be forbidden we whispered and squealed and laughed ourselves silly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children pictures of naked women-the ink drawings in an illustrated life of the model Kiki , who bared herself to men in the street , five francs a breast ; an old black-and-white photo of Sally Rand and her feather fan in a history of Western dance ; a big-paged book of cartoons from Esquire , all bosom and round pink flesh . But these classics were wisps and phantoms compared to the glossy color photographs in the magazines Mary Ann Mackey snuck down from her stepfather 's closet whenever we went to the trailer , and from all this imaged nakedness ( as from what was clothed ) we learned the signifying power of our small but growing breasts . <p> Breasts . How we loved them ! How we imagined the eyes and hands and mouths of men , taking them in . Of men ? Well , boys . Boys ? These boys ? Not me . <p> I had a date about this time , my first and last for years to come . He took me to a dance , a boy I 'd gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes every Monday and Wednesday afternoon . He always chose me as his partner , and when I took my glasses off he said I was kind of cute without them . I wore a little white dress to the dance-my communion dress , without its bolero jacket-a simple , elegant cut , polished cotton , no ruffles or lace . Excited and quiet , we sat far apart in the back seat of his parents ' big car while they drove us to school . This boy and I liked each other , had been flirting in dance class and in math for months . But once we started dancing at the dance , maybe as soon as we got onto the floor , one of the other boys passing us called out my name and asked , " What 's the matter ? Are you scared of him ? " Because I was dancing so far from his body and stiffly in his arms . The way I 'd been taught . <p> I did n't know what to do to fix it , without my glasses could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then it was way too late . The boy was embarrassed and so was I and no recovery would ever be possible . I sat alone at our table the rest of the night , while across the room he laughed with the other guys and now and then danced with their dates . Even on the way home he did n't talk to me , and my mother knew something was wrong as soon as she looked at my face . <p> My mother , though , did n't have breasts , or none to speak of , and I 'd known this all my life . Maybe this had something to do with the silence between us , that night and others , on subjects of love and sex . Maybe she asked what had happened , maybe she did n't . Either way , I could n't have told her , and I went to bed with my secret , crying into my pillow , shamed and bereft . <p> Where were my trailer park girls that night ? Not at that school dance . <p> Trailer park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breight was too fat to be asked to a dance , or thought she was , and had no suitable clothes besides , and Raynelle was too tall and her grandma too strict . So while she and Debbie ate popcorn down in the front row at the movies , Mary Ann went way to the back with an older boy , who put his tongue in her mouth and his hand up inside her dress . <p> These are stories from two different worlds . They coexist in time and place and never intersect . As if I had been two separate girls altogether . I did n't tell Debbie and Raynelle and Mary Ann about my bad date at the dance . I was far too proud to tell anyone who had n't been there to see it . Neither did they tell me about their adventures at the movies . I 'd been to the movies once in the daytime with Mary Ann when a boy came down to sit with her and after a few minutes took her away ; I 'd sat through the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . I was an almost straight-A student . Except for Raynelle , these girls were lucky if they got Cs . No teacher ever telephoned their mothers asking for a family conference out of concern about the company they kept . But our common homeroom teacher did telephone my mother to express that concern over me . <p> My mother , of course , took offense . ( Were there family problems ? Certainly not . Did she not see that my friends were . . . well , unsuitable ? On the contrary . ) My mother admired loyalty , disliked interference , said the teacher was a snob . She was fond of Raynelle , saw only her intelligence , Debbie Breight 's good will . She was n't so sure about Mary Ann , but expected she would outgrow her wilder spirits in time . Friends were friends . The teacher 's worries got dismissed , and nobody asked me . <p> Not that I would have known how to answer . What could the question even have been ? What do you , a straight-A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the home ( and not just the home either , but the house , a real house , with books and cats and two bedrooms and a piano and an honest-to-God big backyard ) - what could such a girl as I have in common with these ? <p> These . These girls , indeed-these girls in their tiny trailers , these girls in their sweaty sleep , these girls with their drunken stepfathers , their harried mothers and working grandmothers , their unprotected afternoons , their fantasies of adulthood and male desire , their awakening bodies , their tingling breasts . <p> What could I have answered ? <p> Could I have said that I remembered my own father 's daily whiskey breath and stubbly chin ? The truth was I did n't . I did n't remember a thing . Could n't I have said that my mother , too , went out to work every day , that I , like these girls , came home to an empty house ( apartment , trailer ) , that I , like them , filled the time and my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me words for . ( Did I want my mother home again ? Not anymore . ) <p> Could I have described careening drunken drives , my parents raging , a couch in tatters , dangling threads , masses of fleas jumping out of the carpet and up my bare legs ? I do n't think so . <p> Or told anyone about the summer my mother first went to work , my father sitting all day on the couch , collecting unemployment and trying not to drink , hiding mail from my mother and making me answer and say he was out whenever the phone rang ? Could I have told anyone how one day when I was home alone , after I had discovered his Playboy and looked longingly at its naked photographs , I read a story about a man so aroused by the breasts of a woman popping out of her torn bra and his own violence as he rescues her from a rape that when she lifts her eyes to thank him he hits her in the face and rapes her himself-how , disturbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big-breasted women staring into the camera as into the eyes of a lover , I suddenly scrunched the magazine up and took it outside and stuffed it into the trash , buried it under bags of garbage and empty bottles and cans ? I was eight years old , and later my father found the magazine , or maybe it was the next day , and because my mother was not in the house , sat on the couch with the magazine open on the cigarette-burned coffee table in front of him , and glaring , called across the room to me , made me come to him and stand there , his beard stubbly and booze on his breath , and reached out his fingers and touched my flat little chest , asking me with a leer and a chuckle , " What 's the matter ? Do n't you like my magazine ? " Could I have told anyone what happened next ? <p> No , in fact I could n't . All that was history . All that had happened long before , to some other little girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got her period and got pregnant and left us all behind . The rumor around school was that her stepfather did it . But nobody really knew . <p> In the last memory I have of Raynelle-although it is surely not the last time I saw her-we are in the ninth grade , on our way out of homeroom on a Monday morning , and she is laughing with Debbie about the date she went on on Saturday night with an older boy Debbie and I do n't know , a boy from her grandma 's church , not from our school . Raynelle 's talking about being in his car 's back seat with him , kissing , and then she starts whispering to Debbie and wo n't repeat another thing to me . " Not for your ears , " she says , and she 's not being mean-Raynelle was never mean-but protective , like a grownup with a child . I know this right away . " Because I 'm too innocent ? " I say , and she tells me , yes , exactly , I really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protesting does no good , and suddenly I see these girls fly far away from me , big and full like hot-air balloons , off into some sky somewhere of adulthood and freedom , my own little impure body still earthbound and tiny and screwed to the ground . <p> I have a last memory of Debbie too , although I know we three were friends until we finished junior high and based on geography got assigned to different schools . ( I did n't know a thing then about the intertextuality of economics , geography , and destiny ; only the smell and texture of secrets and personal shame . ) In this memory of Debbie , it 's a Friday night and I 'm staying over at her house . We 're in our school clothes , in her room undressing for bed , and when she pulls her thin , no-longer-fashionable sweater off , I see the press of naked pinkish flesh into the stretched and frayed-open stitches of her pale yellow imitation satin , vaguely gray and greasy , slightly sweatstained slip . There ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself in what I have left of her , the whole memory : her hungry doughy white girl 's body bursting at her mother 's hand-me-down seams . <p> 3 . <p> A few years ago I got off a plane in Los Angeles , and everything looked exotic . I had been living on the east coast too long , had n't visited L.A. since my parents moved away almost twenty years before . Ice plant and palm trees , bougainvillea , flowers blooming in any direction I turned : an alien landscape . <p> Exotic . Foreign . From outside the world . <p> The city where I was born , where I grew up , my first and maybe only home . <p> I remembered walking to the beach , miles from my parents ' house , early one morning with my best friend , a friend lost by the time I went back to Los Angeles , lost by then for years . I had walked alone to her house , then we walked together , and finally we were walking on the sand . After that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another friend 's , nearer to the beach , or maybe we called for a ride . I did n't remember . What I remembered was leaving my parents ' house just before dawn . It was Christmas vacation , we were home from college , dawn came late . I remembered walking alone in the almost darkness , I remembered stopping to get her , knocking at her bedroom window , remembered walking together for miles and miles , then going into a store near the beach , buying salami and crackers and orange juice for breakfast and walking out onto the sand . I remembered the layer of brown smog hanging low out over the ocean , ready to blow in off the water . I remembered the reason for our long walking , but that would be another story , and anyhow inaccurate , the memory false , an introduction of drama and plot into a walk that had no reason but itself to be . <p> One thing to say from the start is that I loved her . Before any boy , before any man other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes I saw myself I posed before her . I tried out personalities , metaphors , and narratives . I told her everything I knew about myself or thought was true . Even now , as I write I want her to read this . I want her to find me . I want her to help me remember who I was and maybe am . <p> Of course , we were friends at an age when who am I ? was the crucial questionsixteen or so when we met , twenty-eight maybe the last time , but by then I was just passing through . Neither of us lived in L.A. anymore . We had done San Francisco and Berkeley , not exactly together , but in parallel , and occasionally side by side . Then I left California . I had always wanted to move , to be on the road . When I went back we were finally strangers , and after that we lost track . I wrote to her once , to an address one of our friends from high school gave me when he telephoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my letter was never returned . <p> So what is it I want from her ? What memory of myself am I looking for ? I 'd lost a lot of loves by the time I lost her , and so had she . We 'd both been married by then , left our husbands for other men , had other men after that . She was more stable in her relationships than I was , but also more melancholy , and I had a child . I remember her telling me once she did n't care much for sex . I wondered what she was doing in that case , having an affair with a man she had met in Golden Gate Park , walking early in the morning , just after dawn . Later she lived with him in the house where she had been living with Aaron , her husband , who had briefly , years before , been my own boyfriend one Thanksgiving holiday when we were all still so young-lived in that house with the man from the park , an alcoholic she finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a pretty businessman who seemed to love her , a man she knew from work , was going to marry-and married I guess , and disappeared . Maybe they 're happy , maybe they had children , made a life . I hope so . <p> But that picture seems unreal . <p> In the summertime as teenagers we stayed up half the night playing gin and double solitaire . After her mother and father and brother were asleep , when I could be sure no one was watching , I swam naked in her backyard pool . I do n't remember Rachel swimming with me . I do n't remember her sitting outside . I remember her giving me the privacy to do it , to move alone through the warm dark water . Night was still black in those days : streetlamps gave off a shallow white-blue light ; the reddish glow of the city was just a haze to the north beyond rooftops ; lying out in the grass we watched satellites cross a starry sky . <p> Within a few years we were drinking . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only staying at hers . Her bedroom was bigger , she had two beds , a stereo , and her own back door . There was alcohol at her house , and she drank ouzo and I drank bourbon , and sometimes we both drank gin . We played music in her bedroom . We smoked . We swam . None of this was available at my own parents ' house , where I still tried to keep my efforts at adulthood to myself . <p> One of those summers I thought I was in love with Bobby Vaughn , maybe more than one , and staying over at Rachel 's I wished I could be with him . I walked on the beach with him one night one of those summers and the water was phosphorescent and our bare feet kicked up blue traces along the watery sand . <p> One of those summers I was trying to lose my virginity and went with Rachel and Aaron to a party at UCLA , where they both were going to school . The party was in the apartment of a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who frightened her . I could n't see why she resisted him , but she had her reasons-some guy had nearly raped her in the back seat of a car , or maybe he did rape her , and maybe it was this same boy who claimed to love her now . The details blur , but whatever they were , summer seemed to make them history . She had friends at UCLA and I had friends from my college , but in the summers we still mostly hung out with each other and with Aaron and our other old friends from high school . Rachel had feelings for this UCLA boy , though , even if he confused and scared her , so when he and his UCLA crowd gave a party , she took Aaron and me along . <p> I do n't remember anything about the party , only that for me it ended across the street in some guy 's apartment . He was groping at me through my underpants , and I remember wanting him to get the underpants off me , to get to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I kept pushing his fingers away because they were pinching me through the thin cotton . He had my skirt hiked up around my waist and we were kissing hard and struggling over my underwear when suddenly he popped his penis out of his pants and closed my hand around it . I was shocked . It was so much bigger and harder and more naked in my hand than I had imagined a penis would be . I must have pulled back from his kisses . Maybe I looked alarmed . I do n't know . It does n't matter , because just then Aaron and Rachel came shouting for me , knocking at the door . It was time to leave . Aaron was driving . I had no choice . <p> Maybe the guy belittled me for having to go home to my parents . I do n't remember . What I remember is standing outside in the street arguing with Aaron and Rachel , yelling I did n't want to be rescued , I wanted to stay , dying to go back inside to that penis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark night telling me to shape up or ship out , and calling me by my last name . <p> I was crying . I got into the car . <p> I went back to offer myself to that guy a few days later . I embarrassed him , I think . I embarrassed myself . I wanted him to know I was n't a cockteaser . Maybe he told me he was n't interested in a girl who had to run home to her mother . Or maybe he just was n't interested at all . We were drunk , maybe he said . No big deal . Maybe he went back to the party and found himself some other girl . Or maybe in the daylight I did n't like him either . Anything 's possible . But what I remember is putting on my green sleeveless sundress to go to him , a ridiculous dress I 'd made myself and thought was glamorous , and I thought my cheap green perfume was glamorous too . I had read somewhere that a woman should have her own color and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember feeling brave and foolish , open to risk and humiliated , and more than anything astonished and free . <p> I finally lost my virginity back at school ; it happened a few weeks before Christmas holidays and turned out to be a one-night stand , and when I came home I was more determined than ever to sleep with Bobby Vaughn . We made an effort in his car outside Aaron 's New Year 's Eve party but got tangled up in our drunkenness and the condom and my black tights and layers of clothes . <p> Bobby Vaughn and I failed that night in the car , but earlier , inside at the party , Rachel and I stood face to face in the kitchen-lit hallway , holding hands and declaring our love for each other , a declaration so drunk and maudlin and pure it was years before I understood why the boys around us whistled and howled . <p> But it 's the time before all this that I need Rachel to help me remember . It 's the summers when we were best friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , before she tried to kill herself , or maybe did n't , before I was screwing around . It 's the part when we were friends , when we stayed up all night playing cards together and writing letters and journals and reading books and poems aloud , the part when we sat outside in her yard and listened to traffic and crickets , when I swam naked in a darkness she gave to me , when wanting hard to be some kind of grownups , we shared an alien landscape , exotic and foreign and outside the world . <p> There is more to tell , of course , but what it is , exactly , I still do n't know . Something about the quality of my love for her , how it was wrapped up in her pale freckled skin , her big round pale dark-rimmed upward-slanting eyes , her black billowing hair , her thick-bowed pouty lips , her pale round cheeks , her pale round arms , her short almost pudgy fingers , the melancholy in her voice , the tears there somewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she already knew this and I think she believed it . She wore a silver ankh on a chain around her neck . This was early in the sixties-you had to know something about Egypt to wear an ankh that early ; hippies and hippie symbols had n't happened yet . Or maybe it was a beatnik thing . Maybe she picked it up by way of fascination with that San Francisco scene dimly rumored , reaching us in articles in Sunday magazines and Life and Time . She was a stranger , somehow , a foreigner . Not literally . If she was literally from anywhere else it was someplace like Iowa maybe , another state , and even that I 'm not sure of . But an air came with her , an air of the alien , exotic , the possibility of the rest of the world . Or at least that 's what I felt then . <p> When I got off that plane in Los Angeles after twenty years away I had to question everything I thought I knew about my life there . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was seeing my life there and the friends of that life with a stranger 's eyes too . <p> I do n't live in L.A. anymore . I 've visited only twice , and once flew out to San Diego . I landed in San Diego at night , and with the windows rolled down in the cab , I felt the balmy air on my skin and it felt like the air of home . I saw tall-standing palm trees against the moony sky and I cried . I smelled eucalyptus . In the morning from my hotel room balcony I looked at the jagged line of California hills . I walked along the water . I listened to seagulls . <p> Rachel and I had visited San Diego once in that summer when we were sixteen . My father drove us down for the day-he had some kind of business meeting-and dropped us off at the zoo . Together we searched in vain for koala bears , saw a terrible Macbeth , and at night flew home alone . It was my first time flying and except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went back and forth across the aisle , looking out the windows , down at all the streetlights and moving car lights and scattered city lights below . I wanted to be flying . It was all I wanted . I wanted to be on an adventure every minute of my life . I wanted to be anything but a little suburban L.A. girl living at home with parents who underestimated her knowledge and capacity and readiness for the world . All I asked was to have a friend beside me , Rachel with me while I flew . <p> Now , what I see is this : in my imagination I made Rachel the stranger when in reality the stranger was me . I was alien , in my heart exotic , and wanted to love her , so in my heart I made her alien and exotic too . I loved her as I made her , an image of my secret self , and sometimes now I think if I had n't seen things the way I saw them , had n't imagined myself out of myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe Rachel and I would know how to find each other still ; if I had n't made of the world a screen on which to see and make the self , maybe the place I come from , my home city , would n't seem so exotic and foreign , and the landlocked industrial city I live in today maybe would n't feel so barren and strange . <p> But this was the deal I made , the price of the ticket . That first night in the sky , maybe , with Rachel still beside me , when thrilling like children we called each other from window to window , and out before us , earthbound and separate from my skin at last , L.A. became a mirror and spread itself in diamond lights across the darkness below . <p>
