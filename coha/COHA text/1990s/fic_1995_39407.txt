It 's a memory so she can change it  --  warp it along the lines of infinity if she likes , stretch it into submission so that the hand abstracts across the sky in veins of light and the pain is only thunder . Turn the ring into a star , the star into a code pulsing in a lost language . What does it say ? Harbinger of love . Safe . Something senseless . It 's a memory so she can prolong the moment before rain , turn down the thunder , change the emphasis , rearrange . Perfect the scene , straighten the crooked man , and the little girl  --  straighten her splayed walk home . It 's a memory so she could allow it to collapse , implode , or she could close it down altogether . Crush the hero seed in her palm . <p> She could count .

Cassiopeia weeping in the night without Gods . Take out your small box of paints .

Integers on an infinite plane . As if by design . How lonely she is out here , where she 's always stood . <p> They 're whispering . Whispering . All right  --  she can turn it up , but not without risk .

Why must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Irish , and the solution that is always alcohol and the war . <p> In the star-spangled night . O voluptuous dark . Seedy on black velvet .

Time to burn , time to kill . <p> In her pretty cerebellum . Pink . <p> It 's a memory so she can keep it as something in a locket if she likes : little and perfect and finished and carry it around , glittery fetish , press it up to her fiendish and bitter breast . <p> You could count your heartbeats . Turn the body into the calibrated , exquisite machinery it is . It is , is n't it ? You could dissect the heart . Admire it . Finger its perfect valves .

So that the filthy , the factory , the no hope , recedes now , the no chance lets up for a minute  --  the mother 's suffering , the father 's stupid , penniless pride . Is that what he 's thinking ? Or maybe he did n't think anything ; not one to fix emotion with words . Bleak , inchoate- <p> Just get me outta here .
