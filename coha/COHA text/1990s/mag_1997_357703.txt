South America was still attached to Africa and dinosaurs had not yet evolved when the first ginkgo trees appeared on Earth some 230 million years ago . Charles Darwin called them living fossils . The plants are so primitive that they do not produce flowers and yet so hardy that one survived the atomic blast that destroyed Hiroshima . The Chinese have venerated the ginkgo 's foul-smelling fruit for thousands of years , using it for everything from promoting longevity to increasing sexual endurance . And in the past decade , extract of ginkgo has become one of Europe 's most widely prescribed drugs . <P> But no mention of the ancient remedy had ever appeared in the prestigious Journal of the American Medical Association  --  until last week . The first double-blind study in the U.S. on the effects of ginkgo , researchers say , proved that an extract of ginkgo has a small but measurable effect on dementia . " Ginkgo is no miracle , " says Dr. Pierre LeBars , a neurologist at the New York Institute for Medical Research in Tarrytown , N.Y. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some patients who have stabilized for four years . " <P> The key seems to be a substance extracted from the leaves of young ginkgo trees that scientists have dubbed EGb 761 . In Germany , where ginkgo sales topped $163 million last year , the extract has been the subject of hundreds of scientific studies , some even bigger than the one reported in JAMA . These studies show that among other things , EGb 761 helps keep platelets in the blood from clumping together . That 's why ginkgo extract is prescribed in low doses ( 40 mg a day ) in Europe for patients with circulatory problems . Much higher doses ( 240 mg a day ) are used to treat dementia . <P> What makes the JAMA study particularly noteworthy is its rigorous design . The researchers started with 309 test subjects who either had Alzheimer 's disease or had suffered a stroke . These were randomly divided into two groups . One was given 120 mg of ginkgo extract , the other a placebo . Neither the doctors nor their patients knew who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , researchers measured mental deterioration using three standardized tests . The improvements were modest  --  a few points , say , on a 70-point scale  --  and showed up in only two of the three tests , but because the precautions were so elaborate , scientists are confident that the results are real . <P> No one is suggesting that ginkgo will cure dementia or prevent Alzheimer 's . At best , the benefit is limited to a third of patients . But the effect was most pronounced on the subjects who were the least impaired , suggesting that if Alzheimer 's is treated early enough , dementia might be postponed . <P> Even so , do n't rush out to your local health-food store to stock up on ginkgo pills . For one thing , not all ginkgo products are the same ; many do not contain all the active ingredients . Besides , anyone experiencing memory lapses should first consult a physician . At the very least , your doctor can be on the lookout for possible adverse interactions with other drugs . You might also discover that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other condition that does n't respond to ginkgo . <P>  --  By Christine Gorman . With reporting by Jordan Bonfante/Bonn
