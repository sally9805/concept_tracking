When I told my friends that I was working on an article about birth control for parents , their reactions were pretty much the same : a furtive glance at their partner , and something along the lines of " Kind of late for that now , is n't it ? " Parenthood changes many things ; a couple 's choice of birth control is often one of them . Some even consider kids themselves a natural barrier . Who can find the energy for procreation after a day of chasing a toddler ? Nevertheless , parents do need birth control , and they can choose from an abundance of options , ranging from natural to hormonal , from low- to high-maintenance , from invisible to impossible to ignore . Prices are approximate and might be lower or free in some clinics . Quick ! Block Those Fellas Barrier methods approach the problem of birth control very simply : By standing between the cervix and the sperm , either chemically or physically , they make sure that those all-dressed-up sperm have no place to go . Barrier methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontinued use . Condom ( male ) This thin sheath ( made of latex rubber or animal membrane ) that fits over the penis is now available in more sizes , flavours and textures than we ever imagined the first time we smuggled a pack to the drugstore counter and paid for it with lightning speed . Effectiveness : 80 to 98% ( higher end of the range when used with spermicide ) ; cost : $0.45 to $1/use . Advantages : " It 's easy , it 's convenient and it 's cheap , " comments Dawn Chiasson , a 28-year-old mother in Kings County , N.S. Condoms ( latex , not animal membrane ) can also prevent STIs ( sexually transmitted infections ) . Disadvantages : Condoms can break or irritate , a new one must be used each time , and there 's nothing like " Hold it ! " and the rustle of packaging to interrupt the mood . Condom ( female ) New to the Canadian market , the female condom is a polyurethane sheath that lines a woman 's vagina and is held in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does look like a baggie with two rings in it . Effectiveness : 85 to 95% ; cost : $4.50/use . Advantages : The female condom is safe , does not require a prescription , offers protection against STIs and can be used by couples who have problems with latex . It 's also 40% stronger than the male condom , is thinner and conducts body heat more effectively ( for a more natural feel ) . Some men prefer it because they say that it feels like they are having intercourse without a condom . ( Well , they are . ) Disadvantages : The female condom is more expensive than the male version , can make noises your kids would love but you might not , and can be tricky to insert and keep in place . At the moment , you ca n't just pop into the 7-Eleven to get one , but you will find them in most drugstores . Diaphragm and cervical cap These are soft rubber caps that hold spermicide  --  which comes either as foam , cream , suppository or vaginal film ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the barrage of sperm . The good ol ' diaphragm , a longtime fixture in many a bedside table ( in the mid- ' ' 50s , you could buy one from the Eaton 's catalogue ) , sits over the cervix like a dome ; the cervical cap is smaller and fits the cervix like a thimble fits your finger . Effectiveness : 73 to 92% ( higher end of the range when used with spermicide ) ; cost : $40 ( diaphragm ) ; $36 ( cervical cap ) ; plus $2 to $3.50 for spermicide . Advantages : Diaphragms and cervical caps are inexpensive , safe and may protect against some STIs . If you think you 're going to get lucky , you can insert them a few hours before lovemaking ( the cap can be left in and remains effective for 24 to 48 hours ; the diaphragm requires a new application of spermicide each time ) . Disadvantages : Both must be fitted by a health-care professional , checked on a regular basis and left in place for 68 hours after intercourse . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap is not as popular ( probably because it 's the trickier one to use ) , and for this reason is not widely available . Sponge Working like a diaphragm , the sponge shields the cervix , but there 's no messing with cream , foam or jelly because it already contains spermicide . No wonder Seinfeld 's Elaine was hoarding them . Effectiveness : 75 to 90% ; cost : $2.50/use . Advantages : The sponge is safe , easy to use , does n't require a prescription , may protect against STIs and is effective for up to 12 hours . Calgary more Lily Davis switched to the sponge when the mood swings caused by the Pill started to get to her . " I like it quite a bit better . It 's not something you have to run and do just before and it does n't do anything to your body . Disadvantages : You might find yourself wondering if it 's a " spongeworthy " night , because the sponge is fairly expensive if you use it a lot ; some women have trouble inserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Hormone Hoax Synthetic hormones , found in the following methods , typically work by causing changes to a woman 's body . First , they fool it into thinking it 's pregnant so that the ovaries fail to release an egg ; second , they thicken the mucus in the cervix ( putting a damper on a sperm 's travel plans ) ; and third , they thin the lining of the uterus , making it a less-than-hospitable environment for a fertilized egg . The birth control pill The Pill is a compound of estrogen and progestin taken daily . Women ( including breastfeeding mothers ) who ca n't use the Pill because of the side effects associated with estrogen may be able to use the progestin-only mini-Pill . Effectiveness : 99% ( mini-Pill 96% ) ; cost : $20/month ( covered by some health plans ) . Advantages : The Pill is extremely effective , regulates the menstrual cycle and may decrease premenstrual symptoms and cramping . It also reduces the risk of ovarian and uterine cancer . And when the mood strikes you , there 's no fumbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be taken every day , preferably at the same time of day , which can be a problem when you 've got a zillion other motherly duties ( A barrier method should be used if a pill is missed or antibiotics are taken . ) It 's also expensive and does not protect against STIs . Serious ( but rare ) side effects include heart attacks , strokes , blood clots and liver rumours . ( The risk is greater if you smoke or have high blood pressure . ) Some women experience nausea , breast tenderness , mid-cycle bleeding the first few months , weight gain , mood swings , headaches and acne . To this end , Wyeth-Ayerst introduced a new pill in Canada in January . Alesse is a lower-dose estrogen-progestin compound that women take daily ; preliminary clinical trials suggest that the " nuisance " side effects ( headache , nausea , weight gain ) are dramatically reduced . " More choices for women is always great news , " comments Bonnie Johnson , executive director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of Canada . The drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something that 's as low-level as possible and still effective , " she says . " If the research holds in the long term , I think it 's very exciting . " Injections ( Depo-Provera ) This progestin-only injection releases the hormone steadily for 3 months . Effectiveness : 99% ; cost : $41.43/shot . Advantages : Depo-Provera is low-maintenance and lasts a full 3 months . It can also protect against uterine cancer and lessen menstrual bleeding over time . Disadvantages : Fertility may take 6 to 24 months to return after the last injection . Some women experience headaches , dizziness , bloating , tender breasts , moodiness and weight gain . And if you change your mind , you 're stuck for a while . Janet de Jager , a 24-year-old Woodstock , Ontario mother , recently opted for the Depo-Provera shot because her high blood pressure made the Pill an unsafe option . When I spoke to her , she had been bleeding lightly for 3 weeks , a common side effect . " I ca n't go back , " she says ruefully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Implants Norplant , the only product of its kind available in Canada , is a series of 6 implants the size of matchsticks that are surgically placed under the skin in a woman 's upper arm . They slowly release progestin for a period of 5 years . Effectiveness : 99% ; cost : $495/5 years . Advantages : Highly effective and long-lasting . When the mood strikes you , you can go for it . Disadvantages : Norplant is expensive and causes irregular bleeding . Some women experience headaches , dizziness , bloating , tender breasts , mood swings and weight gain . In addition , the implants can be difficult to insert and remove , so women need to make sure their practitioner is capable . Says Bonnie Johnson , " You do n't want to go to the guy who does one a year . Go to the guy who 's doing 15 or 20 a day . " IUD : In a Class By Itself A small device made of plastic and copper with a string attached , the IUD is inserted in the uterus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fertilized egg . ( In Canada , it does not release progestin , as some American brands do . ) Effectiveness : 97 to 99% ; cost : $57 . Advantages : The IUD is highly effective , inexpensive , long-lasting ( up to 10 years depending on the brand ) , and requires little attention except for monthly checks for the string . It can be used during breastfeeding and does not affect spontaneity . Can also be used as an emergency contraceptive ( see " Accidents Will Happen " ) . Disadvantages : Infertility and ectopic pregnancy are risks with the IUD . Side effects can include cramps , backache , spotting , uterine scarring and heavy periods . The IUD has weathered some bad press over the years because of an earlier model 's faulty design , but Johnson argues that lots of women are using this method successfully now . " You 're talking to someone who used an IUD for 9 years , " she comments . " Not Tonight Dear , I 'm Ovulating " Natural methods work with , rather than against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family planning ( NFP ) and breastfeeding both fall into this category , though breastfeeding as the sole method of contraception is , at best , an iffy proposition . The bottom line ? If you definitely do not want to get pregnant , use another method of birth control . The theory of NFP ( a.k.a. the rhythm method ) is simple : Find out when the woman is fertile , then avoid intercourse during that time period . This can be tricky , particularly if your cycle is irregular . Most women use a basal body temperature ( BBT ) thermometer and a menstrual calendar , and monitor their cervical mucus to determine their fertile period . Effectiveness : 65 to 95% ; cost : BBT thermometer : $5 to $20 . Advantages : NFP poses no health risks , is inexpensive , and has no side effects . Many women say that they 're more in touch with their bodies through NFP . Many religions approve of NFP as a method of birth control . Disadvantages : You could be raring to go , but one glance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Understanding your fertility requires extensive instruction , motivation and strict adherence . Women with irregular cycles find NFP very difficult . " I have a lot of concerns about the rhythm method , " comments Sue Johanson , a registered nurse and the host of the syndicated Sunday Night Sex Show . " Most women have a terrible time , especially postpartum , figuring out when their next period 's going to come . And if you ca n't figure that out , how the heck do you figure out when you 're gon na ovulate ? " Accidents Will Happen You left your diaphragm in the bedside table . The condom broke . You forgot to take your pill . An " emergency " method prevents pregnancy after the fact . The IUD can be inserted for this purpose . Emergency contraceptive pill ( a.k.a. the morning-after pill ) Actually a series of four 50 mmg birth control pills . You take 2 within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse and two 12 hours later . The ECP prevents a fertilized egg from implanting itself in the uterus . Effectiveness : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ECP is a last-chance method of preventing pregnancy . " Emergency contraception is probably the hottest thing we 've got going for us , " comments Bonnie Johnson . " I 'd like to see every woman in the country have it in her purse , just in case . " Disadvantages : You must use it within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse , it requires a prescription and may cause birth defects if pregnancy does occur . Side effects can include nausea , headaches , bleeding and diarrhea . The Final Frontier The snip . The blessed event . Whatever you call it , permanent birth control , or sterilization , is a choice made by many couples when they feel their family is complete . In both cases , the tubes ( the fallopians for women , the vas deferens for men ) carrying the egg or sperm are closed through a surgical procedure . No egg or sperm , no baby . Both procedures can be reversed , with varying degrees of success . Tubal Ligation A tubal ligation can now be performed as laparoscopic surgery , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 99% ; cost : covered by most provincial health plans . Advantages : Sandra May , a 37-year-old Peterborough , Ontario mother of 5 , had a tubal ligation when she was 22 years old and had 3 children . After the surgery , " I felt relieved . It was something that I did n't have to worry about anymore . " Later she remarried and had the ligation reversed . Disadvantages : Because a woman 's fallopian tubes are in the abdominal cavity , tubal ligation is major surgery , which always carries some risk . Some women 's menstrual periods are heavier and more symptomatic afterwards . Vasectomy A vasectomy can now be performed as " no-scalpel " surgery , which means that a cut is not required . The surgeon makes a small hole that normally requires no stitches . Unlike a tubal ligation , a vasectomy is external surgery that can often be performed in a doctor 's office . Effectiveness : 99%+ ; cost : covered by most provincial health plans . Advantages : " We wanted to put the brakes on this process , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 37-year-old father of 5 . " Certainly , this is the most effective way to do it . " May considers the procedure itself a non-issue . " I was a bit uncomfortable for a few days afterward , " he recounts . " Then after a week , it was fine . Once it had healed , I 'll be darned if I can find the incision ! " Disadvantages : Alternate birth control is required for a few months until the sperm already produced is emptied . <p>
