<p> WILL THIS HAITI INVASION BRING DEMOCRACY ? <p> Editor  --  Before invading Haiti again , before the flags start flying , before the " Love It or Leave It " signs appear and before planning the numerous victory parades , serious thought should be given to the dismal record of United States intervention in Central America over many , many years . <p> Numerous invasions by our troops have never brought democracy to any of the poverty-stricken people of the area . On the contrary , the military interventions were never for that purpose . General Smedley Butler was involved in most or all of the interventions following the Spanish-American War , and in later years had profound regrets for his participation . He wrote , and I quote , " I spent 33 years and 4 months in active service . And during that period I spent most of my time being a high-class muscle man for Big Business , for Wall Street and for the bankers . In short , I was a racketeer for capitalism . " <p> The people of Haiti have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States intervention . Do n't expect otherwise from another invasion . <p> WILLIAM SCHEFFEL <p> Grass Valley ( Nevada County ) <p> . <p> BANKRUPT EMBARGO <p> Editor  --  Regardless of one 's personal feelings about Fidel Castro , it should be apparent to all Americans that the cost of feeding , sheltering , and guarding over 30,000 detainees indefinitely is more of a burden to the United States than any threat posed by Castro 's government . <p> Even if one considers the alleged lack of human rights , Cuba 's record pales in comparison with China and dozens of other countries we have relations with . The United States ' embargo of Cuba , a dinosaur left over from the Cold War , is maintained due to pressure from Jorge Mas Canosa of the Cuban American National Foundation . This is a man living in the luxury and security of Miami insisting that we starve his own people , with the ultimate goal of causing food riots . His hope is that an ensuing massacre of civilians by police trying to maintain order might help topple Castro . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapon , which is precisely the function of the United States ' morally bankrupt embargo of Cuba . <p> JIM PRCHLIK <p> Oakland <p> . <p> FIGHT OVER MARKET LOSS <p> Editor  --  Regarding single-payer hysteria : <p> Canada , the U.K. , and European countries have a single-payer health system because ( 1 ) unlike the U.S. , those countries can not afford to waste billions of dollars , and ( 2 ) those countries have a legacy of human services and programs . <p> The United States has no such human legacy . Its traditions , oriented around profit-making businesses , only offer the population of the U.S. services or programs which make money . Even the struggle of the unions to equalize social inequities has failed . In the U.S. , all levels of government get stuck with the leftovers which are least desirable and , therefore , most expensive . <p> Single-payer will eliminate the insurance health-care industry . It will have to lay off staff , just as IBM , Xerox and Boeing . Any industry faced with this degree of market loss fights for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health insurance industry is pouring millions into attacking California 's single-payer Proposition 186 . The insurance industry wants the average " Joe " in California to believe that he/she is participating in a process of choosing " a doctor . " This is an exercise in nonsense ! The patient 's plan chooses the doctor . <p> NORMAN A. GILLIES <p> C-C Therapy <p> Oakland <p> . <p> SINGLE-PAYER WO N'T WORK <p> Editor  --  When Dr. Price calls Proposition 186 an " excellent proposal " ( Letters , August 26 ) , he sounds more like a faith healer than a medical doctor . After hacking my way through the prolix jungle of its tortured legalese and ambiguous syntax , I found this 79-page initiative ill-conceived , poorly constructed and grossly overstated . <p> Even before the ink is dry , independent analysts are projecting huge budget shortfalls if Prop . 186 passes . One obvious reason why we ca n't quantify health coverage for all California residents is because the numbers keep changing . It 's far easier for 100 illegal aliens to cross daily into San Diego than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Single-payer " has a seductive ring to it until you read the fine print . Then you discover that federally-exempted employees and self- insured employers could avoid the state-run system . For an authentic single-payer plan to work , the coverage must be inclusive . It 's like saying you 're " a little pregnant . " <p> DENNIS G. KUBY <p> Berkeley <p> . <p> AH , WILDERNESS <p> Editor  --  Your September 3 editorial promoting more and bigger wilderness for California points out that the Chron editors do n't know the definition of " wilderness . " <p> Parks are not synonymous with " wilderness . " Parks have facilities  --  roads , tables , trash cans , parking areas . All of these are prohibited in " wilderness . " <p> " Wilderness " is not parks , greenbelts , or wildlife refuge . Under the Wilderness Act , none of these qualify . " Wildernesses " are areas  --  generally very large areas  --  in which man is allowed to have little or no influence . Only the hardiest can visit a " wilderness , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited . <p> While there is a need for appropriate " wilderness " designation , the fuzzy presentation in the Chron editorial only confuses the issue and leads many of your readers to believe they are supporting park or similar recreation development , when , in fact , they are supporting setting aside vast tracts of land for an elitist few with the time and money to organize a pack trip . To double the amount of wilderness , as you propose , would result in an area nearly twice the size of California being set aside , not counting the parks , wildlife refuges and other government-owned holdings . <p> RICHARD KELLY <p> Shasta Alliance for Resources <p> &; Environment ( SHARE ) <p> Redding ( Shasta County ) <p> . ' EASY APPLAUSE LINES ' <p> Editor  --  John Wildermuth got it exactly right in his September 9 " Campaign Watch " piece about the Endangered Species Act : applause lines are easy to get when politicians draw simplistic analogies about rats versus people . Look for these cheap shots to continue  --  at least until November passes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seldom accurate . The case of the Kern County farmer accused of taking three endangered species just might be worth letting come to trial before we declare the Endangered Species Act " Public Enemy No. 1 . " Few facts have yet to be established in this " cause celebre " among advocates who would gut one of the nation 's most far-sighted environmental programs . <p> Unfortunately , these sorts of " Willie Horton of the Wilderness " stories crowd out examples of how the Endangered Species Act is working . Recently , in the same Kern County that 's the center of much endangered species criticism , the Fish and Wildlife Service , the county and the city of Bakersfield approved one of the country 's largest multispecies habitat conservation plans that allows for development and conservation , reducing the chances of illegal taking of protected species . <p> Needless to say , we did n't get any easy applause lines for our efforts . . . and not a single politicians 's press release ! <p> DAVID KLINGER <p> Fish and Wildlife Service <p> Portland , Ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regarding Messrs . Small , Blackman and Sedgwick 's plans ( Chronicle , September 13 ) for a new theme park on 250 acres of farmland in Gilroy : Gentlemen , please , it 's been done . <p> Instead , picture this . Why not leave the acreage as it is and call it " Vanishing American Ecosystems " ! Just think of the possibilities . Mom and Dad could bring the kids and marvel at the way the vast farmlands used to look before land speculators , agribusiness and developers ( present company excluded , of course ) chewed it to bits . Out-of- work farm hands could be hired to portray flora and fauna that used to call these valleys and hills home . <p> Guys , trust me , this will make Mr. and Mrs. America truly nostalgic . Besides , you 'll be able to sleep at night . <p> DANA RICKMAN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> THE PLAYERS DID IT <p> Editor  --  In your editorial , " Baseball , We Knew You When " ( Chronicle , September 15 ) , you castigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went home . Pardon me , but did n't the players go on strike ? The owners wanted to do something . The players disagreed . Instead of finishing the season and arguing all winter , they took their bats and balls and went home . This was not a lockout , it was a strike . The players acted lilke children . They could have waited till winter and then had plenty of time to work out a solution . <p> IRVING BLACKFIELD <p> Sonoma
