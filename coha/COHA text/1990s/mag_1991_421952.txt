Section : SECURITY They stopped their mail and papers . They even got a friend to watch the place . Minds to ease , they left town only to be ripped off ! AS BUGLARIES PEAK THIS MONTH , HERE 'S HOW TO PROTECT YOUR HOME AND FAMILY . <p> Like most burglars , the thieves who ransacked Dan and Claire Hendrickson 's Denver townhouse were in a hurry . They pulled out drawers , scattered clothes and broke furniture . " We could n't believe the damage . It was so pointless , " says Dan , 32 , a physician who  --  with his wife Claire , 34  --  suffered the break-in while on a trip to Minneapolis last May . The thieves also grabbed $7,100 worth of possessions , including $3,500 in stereo gear and compact disks ( they left behind two 27-inch television sets , apparently too big to carry ) , $1,000 in jewelry and several irreplaceable sentimental items like the shotgun Dan 's father gave him as a child . <p> Just as irreplaceable , though , was something else the crooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first few nights , I could n't even sleep at home , " says Claire , who stayed with friends while her husband worked nights at a local hospital . The couple were suddenly wary of strangers in the quiet southeast Denver neighborhood that had seemed so friendly . " I guess I was naive to think that just because you live on a safe block your home is safe , " says Dan , who plans to fortify his new home ( the couple are moving to Minneapolis ) with deadbolt locks and window bars . " This has changed our lives forever . " <p> This year , more than 3 million American families will discover , as the Hcndricksons did , just how devastating a burglary can be . It is the one serious crime that you are most likely to suffer , outnumbering the 1.8 million car thefts each year and the 1.1 million robberies ( only larcenies-thefts such as pickpocketing that do not involve entry , damage or injury  --  are more common at 9 million ) . Daylight is no protection : some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on reported burglaries nationwide place your risk of being hit at between 2% and 3% a year , but the odds exceed 5% in many cities ( see " How U.S. Cities Rank for Burglary Risk " on page 99 ) . Moreover , Justice Department surveys suggest that better than half of all burglaries go unreported . The thieves ' annual take : $3.4 billion . <p> Do n't think of burglary as just a crime against property , either . In fully 13% of break-ins , crooks encounter someone at home ; a third of those confrontations end in assault ; more than half the assaults include rape . And , as the Hendricksons learned , there are often lingering emotional scars . " After a burglary , the psyche heals slowly , " says Joe Mele of the National Crime Prevention Institute ( NCPI ) at the University of Louisville . " Either people are afraid to go home again or they adopt a fortress-like mentality and they wo n't go out . " In only 14% of breakins is the culprit ever caught . <p> What draws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , and the lack of an alarm system ; houses with alarms are struck only a third as often as those without them . Your locale counts too , and not just whether you live in a high-crime neighborhood . " Burglars are like real estate agents , " explains Simon Hakim of Temple University . " They think location , location and location . " In a study of Philadelphia suburbs , Hakim and his co-workers found that burglars strike 40% more often within three blocks of major thoroughfares , which offer easy escape , than elsewhere . Crooks also prefer corner houses ; nationwide , roughly four out of 10 burglaries happen at corner homes , because two of their closest neighbors are across the street . <p> In 95% of break-ins , burglars case the joint first . That 's easy enough when the crook is a neighbor ( often a teenager ) , as is true about 25% of the time . But professional burglars may pose as joggers to spend time in your neighborhood ; appear at your door pretending to be salesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie Home Alone ; or befriend maids and workmen to find out when you 're gone . " Burglars are shy people who do n't like surprises , " observes Paul Cromwell , director of the Criminal Justice Program at the University of Miami , a city that ranked No. 5 on our burglary capitals list . " They like to arrive when nobody else is home . " <p> Since summer is vacation time for so many Americans , it is also prime burglary season ( break-ins peak in August , when 9.3% of them occur ) . So in this crime-ridden month , MONEY offers the following advice from police , security experts , criminologists and even a former burglar ( see the box above ) on protecting your property and recovering quickly if you do suffer a loss . SECURING YOUR HOME <p> The first step is to be sure your house is protected . Here , the experts recommend five strategies : <p> Reinforce all entrances . Despite their reputation as second-story men , burglars enter on the ground floor 80% of the time . And they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average burglar spends no more than 60 seconds breaking in . " The trick is to delay them for 90 seconds or longer so they may get nervous and leave , " says NCPI 's Mele . Among the tips : fortify exterior doors with deadbolt locks ( about $40 to $80 each ) in which the bolt extends at least 11/2 inches into the door frame ; reinforce sliding glass patio doors with a locking metal rod ( $10 to $20 ) that prevents the door from being opened ; and limit pet doors to no more than six inches across , because some burglars use a child to slip inside and unlock the door . In high-crime areas , consider putting steel security shutters ( $120 ) on first-and second-floor windows and bars ( $30 ) on basement windows . And to keep burglars out of your garage , drill a hole in the track that holds the sliding door and insert a pin or padlock to keep the door from being lifted . Most important , once you 've installed these safeguards , remember to use them : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . <p> Keep your home visible to neighbors . The privacy that many homeowners seek from high fences and shrubs works against : them . when it comes to break-ins . The experts ' advice is to limit greenery to no more than two feet in height , if practical , and build fences of the see-through variety so that burglars ca n't use them to hide . For protection at night , place floodlights all around your house and leave porch and garage lights on while you are asleep . <p> Install an alarm . Although these are practically standard equipment on new homes costing $350,000 or more , nine out of 10 American residences lack them . That 's unfortunate , since several companies  --  including ADT and Brink 's Home Security Service-install basic systems for as little as $400 to $600 ( a more elaborate system for a large suburban home would run $2,000 to $3,000 ) . Besides sounding a siren when tripped , the best alarms automatically place a telephone call to a 24-hour-a-day monitoring service ( cost : $20 to $30 a month ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a false alarm  --  as 98% are , thanks to homeowner carelessness  --  and then phones the police . Many insurers will give you 5% to 15% off your homeowners policy premiums for putting in. such a system . And renters can qualify too by installing a wireless alarm , like AT &T's; System 8000 ( $1,200 and up ) . Regardless of what system you choose , put decals on windows and doors and a small sign on the lawn announcing its presence ; otherwise , the system has no value as a deterrent . <p> Form a neighborhood watch group . Since nosy neighbors are your best protection , enlist their support through a block or neighborhood club whose members keep an eye out for trouble . About 1 million Americans belong to such programs , usually organized with the help of the police or sheriff 's department . " They promote a better rapport between the community and the police , " says Pamela Matsuda , program coordinator of Safety Awareness for Everyone ( SAFE ) , a nonprofit association that helped set up some 2,500 watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation often slows crime in surprising ways . In Tulsa , for example , which ranked No. 25 on our list of cities , police began in September 1990 helping school officials fight truancy by visiting the homes of habitually absent students . Within six months , the truancy rate dropped 50% and daytime burglaries by 27% . " We 're fighting the social ills that breed crime , " says Tulsa Police Chief Drew Diamond . <p> Do n't advertise your travels . Arrange things so that would-be crooks think you ' re home . " One of the biggest mistakes people make is to stop delivery of mail and newspapers  --  burglars may know the people who handle those services and find out you 're leaving , " says David Wacker , a former deputy sheriff and the author of The Complete Guide to Home Security ( Betterway Publications , $14.95 ) . Wacker suggests that you ask a neighbor to pick up your mail and papers ; use timers ( $10 to $35 ) to turn on lights and radios every evening ; and make sure to lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard from the street . He also says to put your business address , not your home address , on luggage tags , so that baggage handlers wo n't know where you live . " That seems a bit paranoid , " Wacker admits , " but a little paranoia can be healthy . " INSURING YOUR POSSESSIONS <p> Besides minimizing the risk of burglary , you should also make sure your home is properly insured . For in stance , do n't buy any homeowners policy that is less comprehensive than a so-called HO-3 , or open-perils policy , which protects you against burglary , theft , fire , wind and other such hazards . Expect to pay $300 to $600 a year for $100,000 of coverage with a $250 deductible , though you can bring the price down by raising the deductible ( hiking it to $500 shaves the cost by 10% ) . The face value should equal at least 80% of what it would cost : to rebuild your home from the ground up ; your belongings will normally be covered for half that amount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full cost of replacing stolen goods , only for their depreciated value , you should also consider a rider that provides replacement-value coverage . That will add about 15% to the premium . You should add another rider to cover furs , watches , jewelry , silver and other valuables that exceed the conventional limit of $1,000 to $2,500 ( cost : $100 a year for each additional $1,000 of coverage ) . If your valuables include fine art , hire an appraiser to judge its worth . Richard Knapp , 51 , of Orinda , Calif. regretted not having done so after thieves stripped his home of $15,000 worth of antique Japanese furniture and Tibetan figurines last October . Knapp , a broker in Asian art , had to find several curators and academics to vouch for the property 's value before his insurer would honor the claim . " Obviously it would have been easier to do this before the goods disappeared , " says Knapp . You can find appraisers either through your insurance agent or the American Society of Appraisers ( 800-272-8258 ) ; fees range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance protection too , though the Insurance Information Institute , a New York City-based trade association , estimates that three out of four of them lack it . Basic tenants insurance  --  known as HO-4-runs about $75 to $225 for a $25,000 policy with a $250 deductible . " Most renters do n't realize that their landlord 's insurance covers only the building itself , not their possessions , " says Harvey Seymour . " They find out the hard way , after the burglary . " <p> With all insurance , keep a complete list of your property  --  including serial numbers of appliances and electronic gear ' , so police can track it  --  plus receipts for all purchases . It is also a good idea to take photographs of the more valuable items , or even to make a room-by-room videotape that can serve as a visual inventory . Keep the list some place where it ca n't be stolen or destroyed by fire . COPING WITH A BREAK-IN <p> Even with the greatest precautions , there is still the possibility your home will be hit . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and hear an intruder in your home , do n't confront him directly . " Burglars are like wild animals , " says Jim Rodriguez , a crime-prevention expert with the San Antonio police . " They 're most likely to fight if they feel trapped . " The best strategy , says Rodriguez , is to get yourself and your family out of the house fast ; if that 's not practical , scream or blow a compressed-air horn ( about $25 ) while your spouse phones the police . In the nightmarish event that you wake to find someone in your room , pretend to be asleep . The experts say you still have the odds on your side : most burglars wo n't attack unless frightened . <p> Similarly , if you return home and find your house broken into , do n't go inside unless you are sure the thieves have left . Once you do go inside , be careful not to touch anything until the police have finished searching for evidence . Do n't give the cops a list of stolen property off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed inventory , since the list you give the police will serve as the basis for your insurance claim . Get a copy of the police report . And take photos of any vandalism or damage before cleaning up . <p> Call your insurance company within a day or two and fill out its claim form carefully . Submit copies of receipts not only for lost goods but also for the cost of repairs . After reviewing the document , a company claims adjuster will propose a settlement . It you do n't like the offer , you have several courses of action : you can haggle directly with the adjuster for a better deal ; you can hire a private adjuster ( commission : 10% to 15% of any settlement ) to negotiate for you ; if your contract provides for it , you can take the case to binding arbitration ( typical cost : $150 to $350 ) ; or you can complain to your state insurance commissioner . For more information on each of these options , telephone the National Insurance Consumer Hotline at 800-942-4242 . <p> Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance , automatically insure goods charged to the card against theft , loss or accidental damage for 90 days after purchase . Notify banks or issuers immediately of any stolen checks or credit cards . And if your insurance fails to compensate you fully , find out whether you can deduct some of the loss from your taxes . Federal tax rules let you write off that portion of a loss that exceeds the sum of any insurance money you get plus 10% of your adjusted gross income plus $100 . " You wo n't get much of a deduction except for a major theft , " says Mary Sprouse , a former Internal Revenue Service auditor and author of Sprouse 's Income Tax Handbook . " But any deduction is better than none . " <p> Finally , keep your eye out for clues the police might have overlooked . That 's what Tom and Carol Mullikin did after someone stole $10,500 in coins , stamps and jewelry from their Great Falls , Va . home last June . Tom , a telephone company executive , happened to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his phone . This gadget , available for about $6 a month in perhaps 40% of phone exchanges nationwide , keeps a log of many incoming calls , including the telephone numbers from which they were placed . <p> After the police had gone , Carol checked the caller ID records for the time they were on vacation and noticed several late-night calls from the same number . " We wondered whether those might be from a burglar casing the home , " says Tom , " so we gave the number to the police . " Officers questioned a 19-year-old boy from the neighborhood ; he confessed , and the Mullikins got back much of what had been stolen . <p> FACT : Police catch the thief in only one burglary out of seven . <p> FACT : Houses on corners suffer 40% of all break-ins . <p> FACT : In 13% of burglaries , robbers find someone at home . <p> FACT : The average loss per residential burglary is over $1,000 . <p> FACT : Contrary to what you may expect , 10% of all burglars are women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break-in is only 5.4 days . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Dan and Claire Hendrickson with the empty stereo cabinet from which burglars cleaned out $3,500 in electronic gear and compact disks <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> BY DEREK I. DINGLE <p> HOW U.S. CITIES RANK FOR BURGLARY RISK <p> Ask most Americans where burglary is the greatest threat and they 'll name New York City , Chicago and Los Angeles . And it 's true : thanks to their huge populations , those cities have the largest numbers of break-ins ( New York City alone had 77,309 of them last year ) . But that does n't tell you anything about burglary rates  --  meaning your chances of getting hit . When we combined Federal Bureau of Investigation and Census Bureau statistics to compute burglary rates in the 50 most populous cities , those megalopolises faded to the bottom third of the list . <p> What took their place was a series of mostly sunbelt cities ( Texas alone claimed four spots in the top 10 ) where burgeoning populations and proximity to the drug trade make a dangerous mix . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of young , unemployed men moving into neighborhoods that lack the social stability of slower-growing cities , " says University of Texas criminologist Mark Warr . " If they ca n't find work , then burglary can become an attractive option . " <p> Take Atlanta , for example , which had 61.0 reported burglaries per 1,000 households last year to nose out Fort Worth ( 60.7 ) for the top spot . Atlanta 's metropolitan area population is expanding over three times faster than the national average , and unemployment in the city averaged 7.2% last year  --  or 1.7 percentage points higher than the 5.5% national rate . Drugs are a factor too , according to Sgt. Charles Hornbuckle of the Atlanta police burglary squad . " Most burglars are crackheads in need of a quick fix , " says Hornbuckle , who notes that the number of cocaine- and heroin-related arrests jumped by 27% from 1989 to 1990 . <p> At the other end of the spectrum , San Francisco reported the lowest rate , with only one break-in for every 71 households , down 27% since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Willis Casey 's decision to boost the number of officers on foot patrol and also cites the city 's strong neighborhood watch programs . Says Agnos : " Those two factors combined help make San Francisco user-unfriendly for burglars . " TABLE <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Mary Granfield <p> A BURGLAR 'S CRIME-STOPPING TIPS <p> Forget Cary Grant 's elegant cat burglar in To Catch a Thief . The real burglar who raids your home is likely to be the criminal equivalent of a working stiff , as Derek T. Dingle 's interview with one such pro  --  we 'll call him Tony Martin-reveals . Active intermittently since 1974 ( except for 10 years in prison on three burglary convictions ) , Martin , 45 , says he 's looted over 250 homes-sometimes working alone , sometimes with his girlfriend  --  in the medium-size sunbelt city where he lives . He 's netted close to $1 million but has never gotten rich : " I spend half the money on drugs and the rest on living expenses , so I have nothing to show for it . " Martin claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade . But he recently lost his job as a laborer and wo n't rule out taking up the trade again . Q. HOW DO YOU SELECT TARGETS ? <p> A. We like rural homes because they 're secluded , but we hit city houses too if they 're surrounded by trees or anything that blocks a neighbor 's view . Whenever we burglarize a place , we keep our eyes out for other homes to hit . A few weeks later , we come back and rob them too . Q. WHAT TYPE OF PEOPLE DO YOU HIT ? <p> A. Middle income or higher . We want to go places where we can make a solid score . We 're looking for homes with guns , VCRs and two or three TV sets . Q. HOW DO YOU OPERATE ? <p> A. My girlfriend knocks on the door . If somebody answers , she asks for directions or acts as if she went to the wrong address . But if nobody 's home , we park in the garage , close the garage door and then break down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girlfriend looks in closets , dressers and under mattresses for jewelry , cash and guns . I grab microwave ovens , television sets , VCRs and stereo equipment . We never stay longer than 10 minutes . Q. WHAT TIME OF DAY DO YOU WORK ? <p> A. Mostly the morning . It 's simpler than at night , since the kids are in school and the parents are at work . Q. WHAT IF SOMEONE COMES HOME ? <p> A. Once my girlfriend and I were in the driveway of a house we 'd burgled when the owner drove up behind us . My girlfriend tried to convince her she was looking for someone . But then the woman spotted me , got scared and took off . She got my license plate number , though . That was one time I got caught . Q. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PROPERTY ? <p> A. I sell it to fences . Many of them are also drug dealers . Sometimes they resell it to average citizens but mostly they trade it for drugs . A lot of it winds up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load the stolen merchandise into a dump truck , cover it with dirt , and pretend to be hauling dirt to Mexico for road construction . Q. HOW MUCH DO YOU GET PAID ? <p> A. For a 19-inch television , anywhere from $75 to $100 ; for a VCR , about $100 . For a .38 special or .22 pistol , the fence wo n't give you more than $30 . But if you get a .44 Magnum or a nine millimeter , you can get $150 . Q. WHAT WOULD DETER YOU ? <p> A. A high-quality alarm system . Most burglars , if they see an alarm , they 'll go to another house ; why bother trying to bypass an alarm when there are so many homes without them ? Dogs are noisy and threatening , but you can usually stop them by giving them a piece of meat or , if that does n't work , shooting them  --  although I do n't usually go in with a gun . Neighborhood watch programs are another story . I try to stay away from neighborhoods like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1986 . They stole a VCR and some jewelry . I felt mad  --  the same way the people I robbed must have felt when they came back to an empty place . But I guess what goes around comes around . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Former burglar " Tony Martin " <p>
