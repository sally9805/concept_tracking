When I wrote Automation over 40 years ago , I did not write it as an exercise in futurism , Instead , I wanted to tell people , particularly managers , that something so significant was brewing that it would change everything , that technologies such as computers and automation would transform the way we do business . As we look back , that impact is easy to recognize , but at the time , it was very difficult . In the early 1950s , when I was a student at the Harvard Graduate School of Business , I would walk some evenings across the footbridge to where Howard Aiken was building big computers like the Mark II at the brand-new computation laboratory . I would go back to the business school and suggest to my teachers that they go and take a look at it . None of them did . Only two of my professors acknowledged that computers were important . One was an accounting professor who knew Hollerith machines ( punched-card readers ) and understood that advancements in that area would change much of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to whom I dedicated Automation . He said , " Of course the professors are n't going to be interested in any of these things . They stay with the old . They are not interested in the new . " THE ROAD TO AUTOMATION It is hard for those who were n't around then to realize , but people had no idea that computers were going to change the world . Instead , they argued arcane things like , " What happens when a truck of scrap metal goes down the street and erases the magnetic records ? " There was a lot of missionary work needed in those early years . But , gradually , a few things began to happen , and suddenly there was a rush of developments such as the use of computers by commercial banks , airlines , transportation , and the telephone companies . Written in the early 1950s , Automation focused on the technology that made things happen . But there was more to it than just technology . During the first big rush , people thought they would buy computers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to figure out how to accomplish their goals in new ways . We have learned much in the last 40 years that we can apply to thinking about the twenty-first century . Here are a few of my thoughts : * IT IS HARD TO CHANGE OLD PATTERNS OF PERCEPTION . People see things from a particular frame of reference that they are used to . But much of what they must deal with , especially in information technology , represents radical change , and it is hard for people to step outside and look at it afresh . * JUST BECAUSE SOMETHING IS TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE DOES N'T MEAN IT WILL NECESSARILY HAPPEN . Many forecasts assume that if something can happen technologically it will happen when it can be done economically . It won't. * PRECONDITIONS ARE OFTEN NEEDED . For example , there is considerable resistance on the part of some doctors to use computers . Once we have a generation of physicians coming out of medical school who have been brought up using computers , however , there will be a completely different approach to medical services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU EXPECT THEM TO . Once you have scoped out what is possible and figured out what you can do , you think that everyone else will start to do it . However , it often takes much longer for the obvious to happen . * YOU CAN NOT ANTICIPATE WHAT PEOPLE WILL DO WITH A NEW TECHNOLOGY . Until you provide it at the market price , the only certainty is that people will not use a new technology the way you would expect . Therefore , demonstrations , pilot projects , and competition are important . A good example is how the Xerox 914 photocopier was turned down by IBM . A study at the time showed that the trend was to use smaller machines , not larger ones like the copier . But when people found they could produce copies of high quality on plain paper , they totally changed what they had been doing  --  everything changed . IBM 's market research totally missed the point that people would behave differently . ALWAYS EXPECTING CHANGE As the developments of the last 40 years continue to unfold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I theorized that computers would , first , change how we do our jobs . Indeed , this pretty much dominated computer and automation applications in the 1950s and 1960s . Second , I believed computers would change the kind of work we do  --  as began to happen during the 1970s and 1980s . Third , I believed the technologies would change the world in which we work . This is the beginning of the next great development in computers and automation , which has already begun in the 1990s . Technology is becoming embedded in all sorts of products and services . It has become a part of our lives . And for the first time , we are seriously altering the way we deliver public services by the use of technology . Public services are typically the most important things we have  --  education , safety , medical treatment and services , and transportation . The delivery of public services has tended to be an area where we decorate an obsolete process with technology . This has especially happened with the renewal of the infrastructure . Renewal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges or filling in potholes , refurbishing systems that were designed in the early twentieth century . We have to realize that we have the ability to look at the public needs of the early twenty-first century and match these with the technologies at our command . We must determine how we can deliver these services in a different way . AUTOMATED HEALTH CARE Health care is an extraordinarily obsolete system . A professor of emergency medicine at a major university sent me a really heart-rending letter . He said that physicians have to start from the very beginning with every patient . There is no history , no time to prepare  --  they know nothing about the patient . We have inferior medical service because the computer technology that could change it is not being used . The difficulties of just accessing patient records  --  apart from analyzing them properly  --  are unnecessary and hinder us from providing quality service . We have the opportunity to do some wholesale rethinking of how we provide health care and turn it into not only medical service , but preventive maintenance that involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilot and demonstration projects in hospitals , by doctors , and especially by private sector participation . Physicians can show patients the consequences of their actions and what the alternatives are . Technologies such as multimedia and interactive computers can allow patients , in the privacy of their own homes , to ask questions about these alternatives . Other countries are moving much more aggressively than the United States in medical informatics . The computerization and redesign of Sweden 's health delivery system has reduced that nation 's spending on health care from 12% of GNP to a little over 7% . More than one-third of the population of the Netherlands have their medical records computerized . While some hospitals in the United States keep computerized patient records , these records only cover the time the patient is in the hospital and do not include their entire medical history . ANTICIPATING THE " INFOSTRUCTURE " I do n't like inventing words , but in trying to think of how to solve infrastructure and public-service problems , I recently found myself writing " infostructure " instead of " information-based infrastructure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing happened to me at Harvard when I was writing on " automation "  --  a handy , clipped form of " automatization . " Information technologies offer many opportunities for improving the delivery of public services . Infostructure obliterates geographical limitations : We can now communicate with an individual anywhere on the globe . By linking doctors ' offices to the information in medical and patient databases , people would be referred to the right specialists , who could see and treat patients much faster . No more sitting for hours in waiting room after waiting room . Immediate access , leading to individualized delivery of service , is the key benefit of the computer revolution . Transportation is another public service in which information technologies offer vast improvements . While start-up arrangements , pricing schemes , and overall timetables have yet to be resolved , intelligent vehicle/highway systems will allow drivers to pass through a toll gate without even stopping : their accounts are debited automatically . This transportation infostructure will also tell you where the nearest hotel is and if there is a room available . If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest repair shop that stocks the parts you need . And if you have an accident or medical emergency , it can tell you where the nearest hospital is , how to get there , and other necessary information . Europe and Japan are already developing such systems . In Japan alone , there are over 250,000 vehicles equipped with position-location devices and electronic maps . The next big wave of change will come , as I theorized in the 1950s , in everyday life . Computers and automation have already changed how we work and what we do  --  now they are changing the world in which we work . But for this to happen satisfactorily , we need fundamental rethinking . We have to resolve issues like privacy , standards , and liability . If a microchip fails and information is lost , we must decide where to delegate responsibility . Solving many of these problems will undoubtedly require a public-private partnership . We should know a lot more about how to make these happen effectively . We must address the public issues , but we also need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of maximum innovation and the dynamism that can be injected into such projects . The problems we now face are fundamentally conceptual , rather than technical . Questions about pricing structures and related regulations must still be answered . It is these conceptual problems that prevent society from accruing any benefits of the infostructure that the technologies are making possible , such as improved cost performance , more-easily shared resources , and more-highly utilized ones . Society must make public services and the physical infrastructure more effective through an increased interaction between the public and private sectors , so that we can create a demand for the kinds of software and hardware for each specific area  --  intelligent highways , health care , etc.  --  that will build the infostructure . Once this is done , major growth industries  --  such as real-time data collection , database storage of historical and current information , communications networking , and service-providing software for the users and support staff of the infostructure  --  will blossom in the years ahead .
