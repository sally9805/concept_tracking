Three artists discuss how they sift through a multitude of pastel choices . <p> The recent resurgence of interest in pastel has produced an array of new materials . Companies such as Unison , Wallis , and Yarka have joined established pastel manufacturers like Sennelier , Holbein , Grumbacher , Schmincke , Winsor &; Newton , Caran d'Ache , Sakura , and Daler-Rowney . All these companies have improved the medium in numerous ways , expanding the choice of colors as well as the variety of textures . With new developments , pastelists wonder which brands are best for certain effects . Here , three artists discuss how they get the most from their pastels . TRUDI T. SMITH <p> To compose her paintings , realist artist Trudi T. Smith of Saratoga Springs , New York , works from photographs of family and friends . Her technique requires numerous layers of pastel , and she believes it is essential to have as many colors to choose as possible . " I started with a set of Rembrandt portrait colors many years ago , " she says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added the rest of the Rembrandt colors , a complete range of Nupastels , a Sennelier landscape set , Diane Townsend darks , a growing collection of Unison , as well as assorted pastel pencils and individual sticks from other manufacturers . Because there are differences among the pastels of various manufacturers in color as well as in degrees of hardness , I 'm continually experimenting with new brands , often mixing my own sticks . " <p> For her custom-made pastels , Smith mixes Wallis Moist Pastels with a palette knife on a glass pie plate . " I pick up globs of color and form them into a shape with my hands or roll them on paper towels . My sticks turn out irregularly shaped and more or less tubular , but the process is fun-like rolling dough . " Her experiments have produced muted mauves , mossy gray-greens , and gray-pinks  --  colors with a little neutrality that she has n't been able to find in any of the pastel sets she owns . She also makes pinkish and orangy whites  --  light colors with a rosy glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes these custom colors , she is still searching for a way to compress them more firmly to get rid of the air pockets because some of them are soft and crumble easily . <p> " While she enjoys the benefits of mixing her own colors , Smith prefers the immediacy of using sticks from different manufacturers . Most of Smith 's work depicts figures , and she believes she can achieve better effects with many different colored pastels of various degrees of hardness rather than one flat tone . " The Rembrandt set provides some of the basic colors , and the Sennelier landscape set is best for bright areas and accents , " she says . She uses Nupastels or Rembrandt pastels in the beginning stages of a picture because their hard consistency stands up against the rough surface she prefers . Recently , she has begun using Unison pastels and incorporating their velvety quality into her paintings . <p> Although she still works on an admittedly nonarchival surface  --  a dark-gray 3M pumice cloth with a linenlike weave and gritty texture-Smith also paints on illustration board prepared with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both of which are white with a sandy surface . " The thick impasto of my paintings calls for a rough surface , " she says . " I want to hold on to all that pigment in order to maximize the sensual , buttery qualities of pastel . " JUDY PELT <p> Judy Pelt of Fort Worth , Texas , works in an impressionistic style of crosshatching and layering . Inspired by unpredictable light effects and brilliant color mixtures , she is continually experimenting with new techniques and materials . Her collection is considerable  --  over 4,000 pastels from most manufacturers , including the 100 she recently created from a set of Wallis Moist Pastels . <p> Employing a traditional technique , Pelt begins her paintings with the hard Girault , Rembrandt , or Grumbacher pastels and works toward softer varieties . She establishes an underpainting of dark pastels , gently massed ( never rubbed ) with an oil-painting bristle or sable brush and denatured alcohol . The alcohol turns the pastel into a watercolorlike wash without buckling the paper , and it dries immediately . <p> Once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of color as the basis for selecting pastels . Her custom-made Wallis pastels , which include a range of oranges , violets , reds , and greens that she uses frequently , contain some of her most vibrant colors . " It 's a rime commitment to mix them , " she says , " but it 's well worth it . It 's so exciting to have such clear , juicy colors . " <p> To reuse pastel pieces too small to paint with , Pelt stores related colors in empty film canisters in a Tupperware tray . Once she has accumulated enough pieces of a similar color , she crushes them with a mortar and pestle , leaving large flecks of solid hues . She works a few drops of water into the pastels at a rime , mixing the blend thoroughly with a palette knife . She forms the mixture into big , flat , square sticks that are perfect for covering large areas . Because the pastels already contain some medium , there 's no need to add binder . " Over 400 of my pastels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pelt says . " I get gorgeous colors from this process . " <p> The artist stores her pastels in a six-foot-long taboret divided into 20 strips , each four inches long . " I have about 4,000 pastels piled two or three deep in each compartment , with no wrappers on any of them so I can see the colors , not the labels , " she says . To keep them clean , Pelt wipes each stick with a rag before putting it away . She stores the pastels in trays lined with strips of batting . " The pastel dust sifts through the batting into the base of the taboret so the sticks do n't sit in gray dust , " she says . <p> Pelt paints aggressively , so she removes the labels to minimize the breakage . " It seems to keep the pastels whole longer , " she says . " I do n't use the point of the stick either . Instead , I lay in broad masses of color with the side of the pastel , which is another reason I prefer unwrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " RICK STONER <p> Rick Stoner of Longmont , Colorado , works with strong color , intense darks , powerful shapes , and thick-layered strokes of pastel sandwiched between multiple sprays of fixative . He works on either Canson or Arches printmaking papers , which he stretches onto a mounting board and coats with a mixture of equal parts pumice and acrylic gel for texture . " Getting a good surface is just the beginning , " he says . " Color and what I do with it are most important . Painting is a matter of letting the eye take over rather than the brain . " <p> Stoner 's strong interest in color has led him to use many brands and types of pastels . " Some manufacturers make harder sticks than others , " he says . " For instance , a Rembrandt Prussian blue is very hard and does n't work well over other colors , but if you begin a painting with it , it works just fine . Softer colors such as the Schmincke yellows or ochres work better over a hard base , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . " <p> The artist often uses hard , dark colors first , as a kind of underpainting . These pastels , which are also less expensive , help him lay in large dark areas and establish the value structure . He then works with softer colors . <p> His favorite soft-textured colors are his Schmincke and Wallis pastels . " The Schmincke pastels are like butter , " he exclaims . " They just flow without crumbling . " The Wallis pastels he 's mixed sometimes crumble , probably because they often comprise two very soft pigments . However , he uses the broken pieces for broad areas or the small ones for fine details . <p> As for the Wallis pigments , he says , " They 're fairly easy to mix and use , and you can control the size of the pastel stick when you 're forming them . But they 're very potent , and the pastel dust and pieces will stain , so put newspapers over the table and floor , or find an area you can afford to mess up . I wear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful to clean up all the loose pieces of pastel . " <p> The artist sprays Blair or Krylon workable fixative between layers of pastel when they start to resist one another . He also uses fixative to correct an area instead of scratching it out , which would remove the tooth . " I use fixative to build textures , allowing colors from the lower layers to come through , " he says . " I apply fixative to the entire painting only once or twice , though I may fix the same area several times . There 's a subtle difference between brands  --  the Blair darkens the area and provides more of a tooth than the Krylon  --  so I use each one depending on the textural effects that I want .
