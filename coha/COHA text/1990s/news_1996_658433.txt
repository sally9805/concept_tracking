<p> In the poorest neighborhoods of the villages flanking Mexico 's Popocatepetl volcano , cardboard roofs are being hastily torn off and replaced with sturdier asbestos protection . <p> Church bells are ringing and warning sirens are wailing , calling villagers to participate in mock evacuations to lower , safer sites . <p> The reason for all this activity is that El Popocatepetl ( popo-kah-TEH-peh-tul ) , an eternally snowcapped peak visible from Mexico City on rare clear days , is telling its neighbors that it is getting ready for what could be a major and very costly eruption . <p> Mexican and American scientists studying the 3.4-mile-high volcano , which awoke from a long-dormant state in January 1994 , agree all the signs point to an explosion . The riddle they ca n't yet answer is when El Popo , as the volcano is known by millions of Mexicans , is likely to pop , and how and with what force . <p> " We could have a large explosion that could expel hot stones and in fact large boulders reaching populations several kilometers away , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Disaster Prevention in Mexico City . " We could receive a large amount of ash that would cause much trouble for water and water delivery , for power lines , traffic , and crops . <p> " But while that is possible , the probability is not very high , " he adds . " What is more probable is a small explosion that allows the pressure building inside the volcano to decrease and the lava flow to stop . " A dome of crusty lava is now building inside El Popo 's crater . But even such an anticlimactic denouement may not occur for months or years , he says . <p> Other scientists agree that Mr. Meli is probably right . But the devastation and terror that volcanoes have wreaked in this century alone , plus the scientific age 's push to move from probability to prediction , have kept the world 's volcanologists searching for ways to better predict when a volcano that is acting up is likely to blow . <p> One of those volcano specialists is Stanley Williams , a professor of geology at Arizona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fame after being chewed up and spit out by a volcano in Colombia in 1993 , and he keeps his name in the public eye by speaking willingly and at length with the press about volcanoes . <p> He is also perfecting an instrument that from a car or an airplane can measure the gases a volcano is emitting , and thus help in foreseeing what the volcano is likely to do next . <p> Williams 's instrument , which he describes as a " little box with something looking like a telescope sticking out of it , " is particularly notable in that it is able to measure a volcano 's gases from 20 to 25 miles away . Today , gas-measuring instruments operate from within a volcano 's crater , making installation and subsequent monitoring very risky - as Williams experienced in Colombia . <p> Williams knows firsthand the attraction of the kind of remote-reading instrument he is developing . He was one of seven volcanologists who descended into the crater of the Galeras volcano in the Colombian Andes in January 1993 - and the only one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gases , lava , ash , and searing rocks killed the other scientists and left Williams with serious injuries . <p> Now back tromping around volcanoes - albeit at a safer distance - Williams spent a week in late May snooping and sniffing around El Popo , his gas-reading box in hand . " We now know that the instrument we were there to test works , " says Williams , speaking from his office in Tempe by telephone . " We were able to drive around and measure from 30 to 40 kilometers 20 to 25 miles downwind how much sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide is coming out of Popo . " <p> El Popo counts nine monitoring stations . Some are located on the volcano 's slopes to measure microseismological activity , while others are in the crater to measure changes in the sulfuric and carbon gases the volcano is emitting . <p> Measuring El Popo 's carbon dioxide production is particularly tricky because of all the carbon gases already swirling around in the air from the notorious air pollution of Mexico City , about 45 miles northwest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - but then volcanology is a young field . The study of volcanoes developed on the heels of the explosion in 1902 of the volcano Pelee on the Caribbean island of Martinique . The volcano was building a dome - like the one now growing inside El Popo 's crater - that had become visible from the nearby city of Saint-Pierre . Martinique 's leaders told the people not to worry , but the volcano exploded , and more than 25,000 people were killed within minutes by a burning , ferocious , fast-descending cloud of fire , gases , ash , and rock . <p> Now scientists know that the appearance of a dome of rocky lava means magma is rising within the volcano , and that some kind of explosion is almost sure to occur . They also know that the hundreds of micro-quakes a volcano can register every day say something about how much energy is being released , how much magma is rising , and where it is . And they are learning more about what a volcano 's gases can tell them . <p> As magma expands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases from the magma . " It 's like the bubbles that fizz up when a bottle of soda is opened , " Williams says . <p> As magma first rises in a volcano , light gases like carbon dioxide are likely to predominate . If the magma then sits and ages , a heavier gas like sulfur dioxide becomes more prevalent - usually indicating a cataclysmic explosion is less likely . But if the rise in heavier gases abruptly falls off and is replaced by carbon dioxide , this can mean fresh magma is rising again , that pressure is building against the old lava dome like a cork in a bottle , and a big bang may be imminent . <p> Scientists got a chance to test volcanic gas readings in the Philippines in 1991 - and warnings based on their findings very likely saved many lives . <p> The Pinatubo volcano overlooking what was then the United States ' Clarke Air Force Base suddenly went from producing very little sulfur dioxide to belching 500 tons a day and then 5,000 tons a day . Then the sulfur dioxide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned Clarke 's commanders to evacuate - and 36 hours after 30,000 soldiers left the base , Mt . Pinatubo blew . <p> Over the few days he recently spent studying El Popo with his box , Williams read the volcano 's sulfuric emissions and noted a " pulsating " ebb and flow in the discharges . But he was was n't there long enough nor did he have access to enough other information , he says , to really decipher what El Popo is up to . <p> His lack of access to Mexican information reflects a clash of styles between some Mexican disaster-prevention officials , who take a serious but sanguine approach to Popo and want to avoid causing a public panic , and Williams , who believes that more public information and preparation is the best way to reduce fears about volcanoes . <p> Williams says that prior to his recent trip to El Popo 's environs , he was assured of full cooperation from Mexican authorities . Then The New York Times published a story that featured Williams and his research and stated that the volcano was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even though that assessment was not a quote from Williams , " I suddenly found all the doors down there being slammed in my face , " he says . <p> Mexican officials are frank in their rejection of what they consider Williams 's sensationalism . " I 'm directly responsible for what he calls closed doors , " says Mexico 's Meli . " I know him to be one of the best volcanologists , but I do n't favor the way he likes to give shocking news to the press without a proper knowledge of what 's going on . <p> " It 's Williams 's view that we are trying to hide how dangerous this volcano is , " he adds , " which is why I told him we would not like to participate in anything he would be doing in Mexico . " <p> An unrepentant Williams says he still believes Mexican officials are not getting enough data to carry out the kind of studies that were done on Mt . Pinatubo , and that the Mexican people are not getting the information they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saying Popo is going to produce a Saint-Pierre ? No , " he says . " But volcanic ash that silently accumulates on a roof is a real danger . Mexicans need to know to sweep it off promptly just as New Yorkers know to shovel snow or people in Los Angeles know what to do in an earthquake . " <p> At 45 miles ' distance from Popo , Mexico City could receive ash , as it has historically , but one of the world 's largest cities is generally considered to face only a slight risk . Still , more than a half-million people live in areas of great or moderate risk . <p> The agency Meli runs did place El Popo 's environs on a " yellow alert " after a series of small explosions in December 1994 , and since then public money has helped to replace weak roofs , and practice evacuations have been stepped up . <p> Popo 's highest reaches were also declared closed to the public - although five climbers entered the restricted area and were killed by a relatively small explosion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dome continues . <p> In Puebla state , taking in El Popo 's eastern slopes , an evacuation zone has been delineated to include 307 communities and 400,000 people . <p> " Our goal is to establish a disaster relief committee in each of those 307 towns , " says Alejandro Rivera Dominguez , director of the Center for Disaster Prevention at the Autonomous University of Puebla , a leading force in Puebla state 's disaster response organization . <p> Mr. Rivera says that threatened communities should be closely involved in disaster-planning efforts , and he strongly supports the idea that the public is better off the better informed it is . " People need to understand that in the case of a major eruption , they have very little time to make the decision to leave , " he says . <p> Still , many people around El Popo resist the idea that a cataclysm could befall them . During the small eruptions of December 1994 , the government did evacuate more than 50,000 people from Popo 's slopes . When nothing more threatening occurred , many of the evacuees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " <p> The small town of Santiago Xalitzintla , sitting inside Ehas never hurt me , so I do n't believe it 's going to now . "
