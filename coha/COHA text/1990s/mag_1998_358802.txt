You should have been at the Brown Derby last week . Actually , these days it 's just the Derby . Hollywood 's old watering hole is now a swing club . That 's ' 90s swing  --  Panama hats and cocktail dresses plus cell phones and plastic . Smoke and libido still hang in the air . So does the spirit of Sinatra . " Obviously , " says Tammi Gower , one of the joint 's owners , " Sinatra was the epitome of cool . " On the night after the great man died , the Derby observed a moment of silence . Then Lavay Smith and Her Red Hot Skillet Lickers bit into My Way . <P> Sinatra is gone ? Sinatrismo lives ! <P> And it has for a while . He survives as the last word in a hipster style all the more fascinating for its plain links to squaredom . The minute that grunge thing came along , circa 1990 , you knew it was only a matter of time before Sinatra and the Rat Pack came back into fashion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sharp dressing and flip courtliness with women . Thus " lounge music , " cool and dressy , then swing music , hot and dressy , plus a bar scene where lounge lizards are n't dinosaurs anymore . Then the film Swingers , about two guys making their way through the world on terms they borrowed from Frank 's life and works . The past year also saw the publication of two histories of the Rat Pack ; a pair of Rat Pack movies are in the works ( an HBO film starring Ray Liotta as Sinatra and a Martin Scorsese film about Dean Martin ) ; and a few weeks ago , the cable channel TV Land drew its highest ratings to date with a never before broadcast Rat Pack concert from 1965 . <P> Until not so long ago , Sinatra 's notion of cool was deader than an imploded casino in Vegas . Bourbon on the rocks and snap-brim hats were your parents '  --  no , worse , your grandparents '  --  idea of hip , stuff that looked quaint beside the bug-eyed alienation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore cuff links , roughly $30,000 worth in the mid-1950s , when that kind of money bought a house or two . In the Oedipal drama of the counterculture , Frank was the daddy-o who must die . He could swing his raincoat over his shoulder and cock his hat all night . Compared to Jim Morrison , he still looked like the man in the gray flannel suit . <P> But Sinatra was not to be undone so easily , and not just because anyone with taste in music never let go of him in the first place . His explosive inner life , which he wore on that cuff-linked sleeve , connected him from the first to the big feelings that the ' 60s passed along to the decades that followed . We just did n't see it at the time . And by now , baby boomers who once turned away from him are old enough to recognize how he created the Rat Pack in part as a defense against his own aging , a way to keep the party going as he reached his mid-40s . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hours before Sinatra did .
