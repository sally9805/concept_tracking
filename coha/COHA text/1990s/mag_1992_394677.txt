On the morning of April 23 , observers in most of North America and in Hawaii can see the Moon occult the most distant planet , Neptune . Unfortunately , only people in Hawaii will see the event in a dark sky . And because it is a morning event , Neptune disappears behind the sunlit limb of the 20.3-day old Moon and reappears from behind the unlit limb . If you 've only recently discovered the joys of backyard observing , this occultation of Neptune may offer you your first chance to view what is currently the most distant planet from the Sun . If you 're an experienced observer , this event is impressive because viewing it with your telescope is a great challenge . Observing Neptune pass behind the Moon is challenging because the two differ so much in brightness . The Moon 's average surface brightness is approximately 270 times greater than that of Neptune , so any source of stray light from the moon will keep you from seeing Neptune at all . The solution ? Maximize the performance of your optical system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use . Your best bet is the largest telescope available that provides a reasonably bright view of Neptune and is unobstructed by a diagonal and its supports . Given the choice between a good 6-inch refractor and an 8-in reflector , choose the unobstructed refractor . Before you make a final choice , however , it pays to observe Neptune several times with all the instruments at your disposal to see which gives the best view . Another good option is to use a very large Newtonian that you 've stopped-down with an off-axis circular mask so the diagonal and its supports do n't intercept the light from the sky . If I lived in Hawaii , I 'd probably view the occultation through my 20-inch Newtonian stopped-down at 7.5 inches of unobstructed aperture . Another alternative is to observe the occultation from an amateur or school observatory in your area . If you present a reasonable plan for observing the occultation , you might be allowed to use one of those facilities . Next , make sure every element in your optical system is scrupulously clean . This event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have n't done it in some time . And for those of you who wear glasses , do n't forget to give them a good cleaning , too . ( For details on cleaning your scope , see " How to Clean Your Mirror " by Michael Porcellino in the March issue . ) This is also a good time to reduce the glare coming from the inside of your telescope 's tube and dew-cap . Either black felt or flocked paper works well as a lining for the inside of your tube . A final trick you can try is to take a small piece of neutral-density filter and place it in the focal plane of your eyepiece . When observing the occultation , keep the Moon behind the filter , except for a tiny sliver where Neptune will disappear . However , you 'll probably need good slow-motion controls on your telescope to maneuver the image into just the right orientation with respect to the " filter bar . " Now for a bit of observing strategy : First , locate Neptune at least an hour before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use as the Moon passes in front of the distant gas giant . Neptune disappears at 11h32m UT ( 1:32 a.m. local time ) as seen from Honolulu , Hawaii , and an hour before then Neptune lies 0.5 deg east of the Moon 's limb . It 's even more important to find Neptune early if you live in the continental United States or in Canada . Your chances of finding the planet are pretty slim if you wait until after daybreak . A final warning : I 've never seen the Moon occult Neptune before , so this will be as new an experience for me as it is for most of you . But even if we do n't see the occultation , the worst that will happen is that we 'll have cleaned our telescopes and had good views of Neptune and the Moon . A SOLAR SYSTEM 'S WORTH 0F PLANETS During the first week of April , you can , in just a few hours ' observing time in the morning , see all nine planets in our solar system . Begin your tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies at your feet . Then shift your gaze upward to Jupiter , which lies low in the western sky around 2 a.m. local time . Your next ( and by far most difficult ) target is distant Pluto . You 'll need at least a 6-inch telescope to spot Pluto , which on the 1st resides in Serpens Caput at a right ascension of 15h36.4m and declination of -3 deg 44 ' ' . However , to verify that you 're really seeing Pluto , you need to observe its field the night before to distinguish which 14th-magnitude " star " in the field has moved . The best way to do this is to make a detailed sketch showing every star in the field on both nights . After Pluto come Uranus and Neptune , whose blue-green disks you 'll find just north of the handle of the Teapot asterism in Sagittarius . Next comes Saturn , which is both easy to find among the stars of Capricornus and , as always , a pleasure to observe . As you proceed toward the eastern horizon , your next stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 4.6 " in diameter and it lies close to the horizon , so you likely wo n't see much detail on the surface . The remaining two planets will test your observing skill , even though they are quite bright . Both Mercury and Venus are near the Sun in the sky and rise less than an hour before it . Even though it 's a bit closer to the Sun than Mercury , Venus is easier to see because it is several magnitudes brighter . If you look a bit south of due east 30 minutes before sunrise , you 'll see the brilliant - 3.9- magnitude Venus rising out of the dusky sky . As soon as you spot Venus , you should look for the much dimmer Mercury just a few degrees to its left . Because both planets lie so close to the horizon , do n't expect to do much more than identify them . TELESCOPIC PLANETS Because we 've just taken a tour of all the planets , I wo n't dwell on each one here . You should realize that Venus is essentially unobservable after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " detectable " is probably a more appropriate description for the 10.5 " - diameter , 95-percent-lit disk of the bright planet . Unlike Venus , Mercury rises out of the horizon murk as the month progresses . Mercury reaches greatest elongation on April 23 , but this is a rather poor apparition for the innermost planet . Consider yourself lucky if the seeing allows you to observe Mercury 's 7.9 " - diameter , 45-percent-lit disk that morning . Although Mars is observable , its small apparent size means that you 'll need exquisite seeing to discern much on its disk . Your best bet is to look for the planet 's south polar cap . It is late fall in Mars ' southern hemisphere and that region is now tilted at its maximum angle to Earth . The outer gas giants , Uranus and Neptune , offer even less than Mars . All you can see on these planet is their blue-green disks . For Uranus , its disk glows at 6th magnitude and measures 3.6 " across , while Neptune glows at 8th magnitude and features a 2.2 " - diameter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are both reasonably well-placed for observation this month . Jupiter is an easy evening object during April . In fact , it should be your main focus at any spring star parties you might host . As you observe Jupiter 's 42 " - diameter disk , remember that you 'll see the most detail when the exit pupil of your telescope is between 0.5 and 1.0 millimeters in diameter . ( The exit pupil is simply the aperture divided by the power . ) So if you 're using a 150mm ( 6-inch ) telescope , try to use a power in the range between 150x and 300x . The seeing likely will force you to observe at the lower end of that range . If you 're showing Jupiter to someone who has n't seen it in a telescope before , think about using an eyepiece-Barlow lens combination to give you the longest eye-relief possible . Also , try a blue filter to bring up the contrast between the dark belts and light zones . You may be observing Saturn alone , because few star party attendees will stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky . But the planet 's 16 " - diameter disk and 37 " - diameter ring system are worth losing a little sleep over . Remember that you can continue observing Saturn well past sunrise . ASTEROIDS IN THE EYEPIECE The brightest asteroid this month remains Vesta , which reached opposition in March . It fades only from magnitude 6.2 to 6.8 during April and is quite easy to find in eastern Leo . the brightest asteroid to reach opposition this month , however , is 11 Parthenope . This chunk of rock measures about 90 miles in diameter and reflects enough light in our direction to glow faintly at magnitude 9.7 . You can find Vesta with the aid of the finder chart or table of coordinates on the opposite page , while Parthenope will come into view with the help of the map and table at right .

" n1 So announces former nun and self-professed " freelance monotheist " Karen Armstrong . This quote sums up the single most influential argument currently serving to deflect the accusation that Islam is inherently violent and intolerant : All monotheistic religions , proponents of such an argument say , and not just Islam , have their fair share of violent and intolerant scriptures , as well as bloody histories . Thus , whenever Islam 's sacred scriptures -- the Qur'an first , followed by the reports on the words and deeds of Muhammad ( the Hadith )  - -  are highlighted as demonstrative of the religion 's innate bellicosity , the immediate rejoinder is that other scriptures , specifically those of Judeo-Christianity , are as riddled with violent passages . <p> More often than not , this argument puts an end to any discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead , the default answer becomes that it is not Islam per se but rather Muslim grievance and frustration -- ever exacerbated by economic , political , and social factors -- that lead to violence . That this view comports perfectly with the secular West 's " materialistic " epistemology makes it all the more unquestioned . <p> Therefore , before condemning the Qur'an and the historical words and deeds of Islam 's prophet Muhammad for inciting violence and intolerance , Jews are counseled to consider the historical atrocities committed by their Hebrew forefathers as recorded in their own scriptures ; Christians are advised to consider the brutal cycle of violence their forbears have committed in the name of their faith against both non-Christians and fellow Christians . In other words , Jews and Christians are reminded that those who live in glass houses should not be hurling stones . <p> But is that really the case ? Is the analogy with other scriptures legitimate ? Does Hebrew violence in the ancient era , and Christian violence in the medieval era , compare to or explain away the tenacity of Muslim violence in the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HISTORY Along with Armstrong , any number of prominent writers , historians , and theologians have championed this " relativist " view . For instance , John Esposito , director of the Prince Alwaleed bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding at Georgetown University , wonders , <p> How come we keep on asking the same question , about violence in Islam , and do n't ask the same question about Christianity and Judaism ? Jews and Christians have engaged in acts of violence . All of us have the transcendent and the dark side . ... We have our own theology of hate . In mainstream Christianity and Judaism , we tend to be intolerant ; we adhere to an exclusivist theology , of us versus them. ( n2 ) <p> An article by Pennsylvania State University humanities professor Philip Jenkins , " Dark Passages , " delineates this position most fully . It aspires to show that the Bible is more violent than the Qur'an : <p> In terms of ordering violence and bloodshed , any simplistic claim about the superiority of the Bible to the Koran would be wildly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ texts of terror , " to borrow a phrase coined by the American theologian Phyllis Trible . The Bible contains far more verses praising or urging bloodshed than does the Koran , and biblical violence is often far more extreme , and marked by more indiscriminate savagery . ... If the founding text shapes the whole religion , then Judaism and Christianity deserve the utmost condemnation as religions of savagery. ( n3 ) <p> Several anecdotes from the Bible as well as from Judeo-Christian history illustrate Jenkins ' point , but two in particular-one supposedly representative of Judaism , the other of Christianity -- are regularly mentioned and therefore deserve closer examination . <p> The military conquest of the land of Canaan by the Hebrews in about 1200 B.C.E. is often characterized as " genocide " and has all but become emblematic of biblical violence and intolerance . God told Moses : <p> But of the cities of these peoples which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance , you shall let nothing that breathes remain alive , but you shall utterly destroy them -- the Hittite , Amorite , Canaanite , Perizzite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has commanded you , lest they teach you to do according to all their abominations which they have done for their gods , and you sin against the Lord your God. ( n4 ) <p> So Joshua Moses ' successor conquered all the land : the mountain country and the South and the lowland and the wilderness slopes , and all their kings ; he left none remaining , but utterly destroyed all that breathed , as the Lord , God of Israel had commanded. ( n5 ) <p> As for Christianity , since it is impossible to find New Testament verses inciting violence , those who espouse the view that Christianity is as violent as Islam rely on historical events such as the Crusader wars waged by European Christians between the eleventh and thirteenth centuries . The Crusades were in fact violent and led to atrocities by the modern world 's standards under the banner of the cross and in the name of Christianity . After breaching the walls of Jerusalem in 1099 , for example , the Crusaders reportedly slaughtered almost every inhabitant of the Holy City . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaughter was so great that our men waded in blood up to their ankles . " ( n6 ) <p> In light of the above , as Armstrong , Esposito , Jenkins , and others argue , why should Jews and Christians point to the Qur'an as evidence of Islam 's violence while ignoring their own scriptures and history ? <p> L : BIBLE VERSUS QUR'AN The answer lies in the fact that such observations confuse history and theology by conflating the temporal actions of men with what are understood to be the immutable words of God . The fundamental error is that Judeo-Christian history -- which is violent -- is being conflated with Islamic theology -- which commands violence . Of course , the three major monotheistic religions have all had their share of violence and intolerance towards the " other . " Whether this violence is ordained by God or whether warlike men merely wished it thus is the key question . <p> Old Testament violence is an interesting case in point . God clearly ordered the Hebrews to annihilate the Canaanites and surrounding peoples . Such violence is therefore an expression of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the historic violence committed by the Hebrews and recorded in the Old Testament is just that -- history . It happened ; God commanded it . But it revolved around a specific time and place and was directed against a specific people . At no time did such violence go on to become standardized or codified into Jewish law . In short , biblical accounts of violence are descriptive , not prescriptive . <p> This is where Islamic violence is unique . Though similar to the violence of the Old Testament -- commanded by God and manifested in history -- certain aspects of Islamic violence and intolerance have become standardized in Islamic law and apply at all times . Thus , while the violence found in the Qur'an has a historical context , its ultimate significance is theological . Consider the following Qur'anic verses , better known as the " sword-verses " : <p> Then , when the sacred months are drawn away , slay the idolaters wherever you find them , and take them , and confine them , and lie in wait for them at every place of ambush . But if they repent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then let them go their way. ( n7 ) <p> Fight those who believe not in God and the Last Day , and do not forbid what God and His Messenger have forbidden -- such men as practise not the religion of truth , being of those who have been given the Book -- until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled. ( n8 ) <p> As with Old Testament verses where God commanded the Hebrews to attack and slay their neighbors , the sword-verses also have a historical context . God first issued these commandments after the Muslims under Muhammad 's leadership had grown sufficiently strong to invade their Christian and pagan neighbors . But unlike the bellicose verses and anecdotes of the Old Testament , the sword-verses became fundamental to Islam 's subsequent relationship to both the " people of the book " ( i.e. , Jews and Christians ) and the " pagans " ( i.e. , Hindus , Buddhists , animists , etc. ) and , in fact , set off the Islamic conquests , which changed the face of the world forever . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pagans and polytheists must either convert to Islam or be killed ; simultaneously , Qur'an 9:29 is the primary source of Islam 's well-known discriminatory practices against conquered Christians and Jews living under Islamic suzerainty . <p> In fact , based on the sword-verses as well as countless other Qur'anic verses and oral traditions attributed to Muhammad , Islam 's learned officials , sheikhs , muftis , and imams throughout the ages have all reached consensus -- binding on the entire Muslim community -- that Islam is to be at perpetual war with the non-Muslim world until the former subsumes the latter . Indeed , it is widely held by Muslim scholars that since the sword-verses are among the final revelations on the topic of Islam 's relationship to non-Muslims , that they alone have abrogated some 200 of the Qur'an 's earlier and more tolerant verses , such as " no compulsion is there in religion . " n9 Famous Muslim scholar Ibn Khaldun ( 1332-1406 ) admired in the West for his " progressive " insights , also puts to rest the notion that jihad is defensive warfare : <p> In the Muslim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because of the universalism of the Muslim mission and the obligation to convert everybody to Islam either by persuasion or by force ... The other religious groups did not have a universal mission , and the holy war was not a religious duty for them , save only for purposes of defense ... They are merely required to establish their religion among their own people . That is why the Israelites after Moses and Joshua remained unconcerned with royal authority e.g. , a caliphate . Their only concern was to establish their religion not spread it to the nations ... But Islam is under obligation to gain power over other nations. ( n10 ) <p> Modern authorities agree . The Encyclopaedia of Islam 's entry for " jihad " by Emile Tyan states that the " spread of Islam by arms is a religious duty upon Muslims in general ... Jihad must continue to be done until the whole world is under the role of Islam ... Islam must completely be made over before the doctrine of jihad warfare to spread Islam can be eliminated . " Iraqi jurist Majid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , writes that " jihad ... is regarded by all jurists , with almost no exception , as a collective obligation of the whole Muslim community . " n11 And , of course , Muslim legal manuals written in Arabic are even more explicit. ( n12 ) <p> L : QUAR'NIC LANGUAGE When the Qur'an 's violent verses are juxtaposed with their Old Testament counterparts , they are especially distinct for using language that transcends time and space , inciting believers to attack and slay nonbelievers today no less than yesterday . God commanded the Hebrews to kill Hittites , Amorites , Canaanites , Perizzites , Hivites , and Jebusites -- all specific peoples rooted to a specific time and place . At no time did God give an open-ended command for the Hebrews , and by extension their Jewish descendants , to fight and kill gentiles . On the other hand , though Islam 's original enemies were , like Judaism 's , historical ( e.g. , Christian Byzantines and Zoroastrian Persians ) , the Qur'an rarely singles them out by their proper names . Instead , Muslims were ( and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they pay the tribute out of hand and have been humbled " n13 and to " slay the idolaters wherever you find them . " ( n14 ) <p> The two Arabic conjunctions " until " ( hata ) and " wherever " ( haythu ) demonstrate the perpetual and ubiquitous nature of these commandments : There are still " people of the book " who have yet to be " utterly humbled " ( especially in the Americas , Europe , and Israel ) and " pagans " to be slain " wherever " one looks ( especially Asia and sub-Saharan Africa ) . In fact , the salient feature of almost all of the violent commandments in Islamic scriptures is their open-ended and generic nature : " Fight them non-Muslims until there is no persecution and the religion is God 's entirely . Emphasis added . " Is Also , in a well-attested tradition that appears in the hadith collections , Muhammad proclaims : <p> I have been commanded to wage war against mankind until they testify that there is no god but God and that Muhammad is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer , and pay the alms-tax i.e. , convert to Islam . If they do so , their blood and property are protected . Emphasis added. . ( n16 ) <p> This linguistic aspect is crucial to understanding scriptural exegeses regarding violence . Again , it bears repeating that neither Jewish nor Christian scriptures -- the Old and New Testaments , respectively -- employ such perpetual , open-ended commandments . Despite all this , Jenkins laments that <p> Commands to kill , to commit ethnic cleansing , to institutionalize segregation , to hate and fear other races and religions ... all are in the Bible , and occur with a far greater frequency than in the Qur'an . At every stage , we can argue what the passages in question mean , and certainly whether they should have any relevance for later ages . But the fact remains that the words are there , and their inclusion in the scripture means that they are , literally , canonized , no less than in the Muslim scripture. ( n17 ) <p> One wonders what Jenkins has in mind by the word " canonized . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the canon of Judeo-Christian scripture , he is absolutely correct ; conversely , if by canonized he means or is trying to connote that these verses have been implemented in the Judeo-Christian Weltanschauung , he is absolutely wrong . <p> Yet one need not rely on purely exegetical and philological arguments ; both history and current events give the lie to Jenkins 's relativism . Whereas first-century Christianity spread via the blood of martyrs , first-century Islam spread through violent conquest and bloodshed . Indeed , from day one to the present -- whenever it could -- Islam spread through conquest , as evinced by the fact that the majority of what is now known as the Islamic world , or dar al-Islam , was conquered by the sword of Islam . This is a historic fact , attested to by the most authoritative Islamic historians . Even the Arabian peninsula , the " home " of Islam , was subdued by great force and bloodshed , as evidenced by the Ridda wars following Muhammad 's death when tens of thousands of Arabs were put to the sword by the first caliph Abu Bakr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ default position which purports to explain away Islamic violence -- that the latter is a product of Muslim frustration vis -- vis political or economic oppression -- one must ask : What about all the oppressed Christians and Jews , not to mention Hindus and Buddhists of the world today ? <p> L : MUHAMMAD 'S ROLE Where is their religiously-garbed violence ' ? The fact remains : Even though the Islamic world has the lion 's share of dramatic headlines -- of violence , terrorism , suicide-attacks , decapitations-it is certainly not the only region in the world suffering under both internal and external pressures . <p> For instance , even though practically all of sub-Saharan Africa is currently riddled with political corruption , oppression and poverty , when it comes to violence , terrorism , and sheer chaos , Somalia -- which also happens to be the only sub-Saharan country that is entirely Muslim-leads the pack . Moreover , those most responsible for Somali violence and the enforcement of intolerant , draconian , legal measures -- the members of the jihadi group Al-Shabab ( the youth ) - articulate and justify all their actions through an Islamist paradigm . <p> In Sudan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples is currently being waged by Khartoum 's Islamist government and has left nearly a million " infidels " and " apostates " dead . That the Organization of Islamic Conference has come to the defense of Sudanese president Hassan Ahmad al-Bashir , who is wanted by the International Criminal Court , is further telling of the Islamic body 's approval of violence toward both non-Muslims and those deemed not Muslim enough . <p> Latin American and non-Muslim Asian countries also have their fair share of oppressive , authoritarian regimes , poverty , and all the rest that the Muslim world suffers . Yet , unlike the near daily headlines emanating from the Islamic world , there are no records of practicing Christians , Buddhists , or Hindus crashing explosives-laden vehicles into the buildings of oppressive ( e.g. , Cuban or Chinese communist ) regimes , all the while waving their scriptures in hand and screaming , " Jesus or Buddha or Vishnu is great ! " Why ? <p> There is one final aspect that is often overlooked -- either from ignorance or disingenuousness -- by those who insist that violence and intolerance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the divine words of the Qur'an , Muhammad 's pattern of behavior -- his sunna or " example "  - -  is an extremely important source of legislation in Islam . Muslims are exhorted to emulate Muhammad in all walks of life : " You have had a good example in God 's Messenger . " n18 And Muhammad 's pattern of conduct toward non-Muslims is quite explicit . <p> Sarcastically arguing against the concept of moderate Islam , for example , terrorist Osama bin Laden , who enjoys half the Arab-Islamic world 's support per an Al-Jazeera poll , n19 portrays the Prophet 's sunna thusly : <p> " Moderation " is demonstrated by our prophet who did not remain more than three months in Medina without raiding or sending a raiding party into the lands of the infidels to beat down their strongholds and seize their possessions , their lives , and their women. ( n20 ) <p> In fact , based on both the Qur'an and Muhammad 's sunna , pillaging and plundering infidels , enslaving their children , and placing their women in concubinage is well founded. n21 And the concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Sunnis , are named after -- essentially asserts that anything performed or approved by Muhammad , humanity 's most perfect example , is applicable for Muslims today no less than yesterday . This , of course , does not mean that Muslims in mass live only to plunder and rape . <p> But it does mean that persons naturally inclined to such activities , and who also happen to be Muslim , can -- and do -- quite easily justify their actions by referring to the " Sunna of the Prophet "  - -  the way Al-Qaeda , for example , justified its attacks on 9/11 where innocents including women and children were killed : Muhammad authorized his followers to use catapults during their siege of the town of Ta'if in 630 C.E. -- townspeople had refused to submit-though he was aware that women and children were sheltered there . Also , when asked if it was permissible to launch night raids or set fire to the fortifications of the infidels if women and children were among them , the Prophet is said to have responded , " They women and children are from among them infidels. " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law-centric and possibly legalistic , Judaism has no such equivalent to the Sunna ; the words and deeds of the patriarchs , though described in the Old Testament , never went on to prescribe Jewish law . Neither Abraham 's " whitelies , " nor Jacob 's perfidy , nor Moses ' short-fuse , nor David 's adultery , nor Solomon 's philandering ever went on to instruct Jews or Christians . They were understood as historical acts perpetrated by fallible men who were more often than not punished by God for their less than ideal behavior . <p> As for Christianity , much of the Old Testament law was abrogated or fulfilled -- depending on one 's perspective -- by Jesus . " Eye for an eye " gave way to " turn the other cheek . " Totally loving God and one 's neighbor became supreme law. n23 Furthermore , Jesus ' sunna -- as in " What would Jesus do ? " - is characterized by passivity and altruism . The New Testament contains absolutely no exhortations to violence . <p> Still , there are those who attempt to portray Jesus as having a similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former -- who " spoke to the multitudes in parables and without a parable spoke not " ( n24 )  - -  said , " I come not to bring peace but a sword . " n25 But based on the context of this statement , it is clear that Jesus was not commanding violence against non-Christians but rather predicting that strife will exist between Christians and their environment -- a prediction that was only too true as early Christians , far from taking up the sword , passively perished by the sword in martyrdom as too often they still do in the Muslim world. ( n26 ) <p> Others point to the violence predicted in the Book of Revelation while , again , failing to discern that the entire account is descriptive -- not to mention clearly symbolic -- and thus hardly prescriptive for Christians . At any rate , how can one conscionably compare this handful of New Testament verses that metaphorically mention the word " sword " to the literally hundreds of Qur'anic injunctions and statements by Muhammad that clearly command Muslims to take up a very real sword against non-Muslims ? <p> Undeterred , Jenkins bemoans the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan to stone Jesus , they plot to kill him ; in turn , Jesus calls them liars , children of the Devil . " n27 It still remains to be seen if being called " children of the Devil " is more offensive than being referred to as the descendents of apes and pigs -- the Qur'an 's appellation for Jews. n28 Name calling aside , however , what matters here is that , whereas the New Testament does not command Christians to treat Jews as " children of the Devil , " based on the Qur'an , primarily 9:29 , Islamic law obligates Muslims to subjugate Jews , indeed , all non-Muslims . <p> Does this mean that no self-professed Christian can be anti-Semitic ? Of course not . But it does mean that Christian anti-Semites are living oxymorons -- for the simple reason that textually and theologically , Christianity , far from teaching hatred or animosity , unambiguously stresses love and forgiveness . Whether or not all Christians follow such mandates is hardly the point ; just as whether or not all Muslims uphold the obligation of jihad is hardly the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command ? <p> John Esposito is therefore right to assert that " Jews and Christians have engaged in acts of violence . " He is wrong , however , to add , " We Christians have our own theology of hate . " Nothing in the New Testament teaches hate-certainly nothing to compare with Qur'anic injunctions such as : " We Muslims disbelieve in you non-Muslims , and between us and you enmity has shown itself , and hatred for ever until you believe in God alone . " ( n29 ) <p> L : REASSESSING THE CRUSADES And it is from here that one can best appreciate the historic Crusades -- events that have been thoroughly distorted by Islam 's many influential apologists . Karen Armstrong , for instance , has practically made a career for herself by misrepresenting the Crusades , writing , for example , that " the idea that Islam imposed itself by the sword is a Western fiction , fabricated during the time of the Crusades when , in fact , it was Western Christians who were fighting brutal holy wars against Islam . " n30 That a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done makes her critique all the more marketable . Statements such as this ignore the fact that from the beginnings of Islam , more than 400 years before the Crusades , Christians have noted that Islam was spread by the sword. n31 Indeed , authoritative Muslim historians writing centuries before the Crusades , such as Ahmad Ibn Yahya al-Baladhuri ( d. 892 ) and Muhammad ibn Jarir at-Tabari ( 838-923 ) , make it clear that Islam was spread by the sword . <p> The fact remains : The Crusades were a counterattack on Islam-not an unprovoked assault as Armstrong and other revisionist historians portray . Eminent historian Bernard Lewis puts it well , <p> Even the Christian crusade , often compared with the Muslim jihad , was itself a delayed and limited response to the jihad and in part also an imitation . But unlike the jihad , it was concerned primarily with the defense or reconquest of threatened or lost Christian territory . It was , with few exceptions , limited to the successful wars for the recovery of southwest Europe , and the unsuccessful wars to recover the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balkans . The Muslim jihad , in contrast , was perceived as unlimited , as a religious obligation that would continue until all the world had either adopted the Muslim faith or submitted to Muslim rule . ... The object of jihad is to bring the whole world under Islamic law. ( n32 ) <p> Moreover , Muslim invasions and atrocities against Christians were on the rise in the decades before the launch of the Crusades in 1096 . The Fatimid caliph Abu ' Ali Mansur Tariqu'l-Hakim ( r. 996-1021 ) desecrated and destroyed a number of important churches -- such as the Church of St. Mark in Egypt and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem -- and decreed even more oppressive than usual decrees against Christians and Jews . Then , in 1071 , the Seljuk Turks crushed the Byzantines in the pivotal battle of Manzikert and , in effect , conquered a major chunk of Byzantine Anatolia presaging the way for the eventual capture of Constantinople centuries later . <p> It was against this backdrop that Pope Urban II ( r. 1088-1099 ) called for the Crusades : <p> From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale has gone forth and very frequently has been brought to our ears , namely , that a race from the kingdom of the Persians i.e. , Muslim Turks ... has invaded the lands of those Christians and has depopulated them by the sword , pillage and fire ; it has led away a part of the captives into its own country , and a part it has destroyed by cruel tortures ; it has either entirely destroyed the churches of God or appropriated them for the rites of its own religion. ( n33 ) <p> Even though Urban II 's description is historically accurate , the fact remains : However one interprets these wars -- as offensive or defensive , just or unjust -- it is evident that they were not based on the example of Jesus , who exhorted his followers to " love your enemies , bless those who curse you , do good to those who hate you , and pray for those who spitefully use you and persecute you . " n34 Indeed , it took centuries of theological debate , from Augustine to Aquinas , to rationalize defensive war -- articulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem that if anyone , it is the Crusaders -- not the jihadists -- who have been less than faithful to their scriptures ( from a literal standpoint ) ; or put conversely , it is the jihadists -- not the Crusaders -- who have faithfully fulfilled their scriptures ( also from a literal stand point ) . Moreover , like the violent accounts of the Old Testament , the Crusades are historic in nature and not manifestations of any deeper scriptural truths . <p> In fact , far from suggesting anything intrinsic to Christianity , the Crusades ironically better help explain Islam . For what the Crusades demonstrated once and for all is that irrespective of religious teachings -- indeed , in the case of these so-called Christian Crusades , despite them-man is often predisposed to violence . But this begs the question : If this is how Christians behaved-who are commanded to love , bless , and do good to their enemies who hate , curse , and persecute them -- how much more can be expected of Muslims who , while sharing the same violent tendencies , are further commanded by the Deity to attack , kill , and plunder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrea Bistrich , " Discovering the common grounds of world religions , " interview with Karen Armstrong , Share International , Sept. 2007 , pp. 19-22 . <p>  --  ( n2 ) C-SPAN2 , June 5 , 2004 . <p>  --  ( n3 ) Philip Jenkins .
