Organic Foods May Be Grown With Sewage Sludge and Drugs // ast December , Secretary of Agriculture Dan Glickman made a greatly anticipated announcement that at once had farmers , consumers and organic retailers across the country holding their breath , then choking and bellowing in astonished protest : The proposed federal organic standards for U.S. food crops included inherently inappropriate practices like genetic engineering , the use of sewage sludge as fertilizer , irradiation and livestock confinement practices straight from the factory farm . After the booing and hissing and agency grandstanding subsided , an outraged organic community demanded to know what was going on . " These standards were requested by the industry , " Glickman replied . Industry mouths dropped . The organic standards proposed by the USDA are not yet law . Consumers have until April 30th to address comments and criticisms to the agency , which will review all submissions before drafting a finalized rule . But the question remains , how did these non-organic concepts get into the proposal to begin with ? Back in 1990 , when Congress passed the Organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry was a fledgling enterprise , made up of small farming networks-and supported by anti-pesticide groups-whose gross sales totaled $78 million in 1980 . But with organic sales topping $4 billion in 1997 alone , and the industry growing at roughly 25 percent a year for the last seven years straight , organic foods are now a very popular commodity . A recent poll conducted by Prevention magazine and the Food Marketing Institute showed that three out of 10 shoppers now buy organically grown produce , while 54 percent said that a national standard would make them more likely to purchase organic foods . But organics ' popularity could be greatly jeopardized by these proposed standards . Why all the fuss , particularly about genetic engineering , sewage sludge and irradiation , known in the organics trade as the " Big Three " ? Bu Nygrens , vice-president of the Organic Trade Association , says , " The Big Three are red herrings to draw attention away from other important issues in the bill , " mainly livestock confinement and antibiotic issues , and synthetic additives . Other organic advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But according to the Annapolis , Maryland-based Environmental Research Foundation , agribusiness giants like Monsanto pushed the agency heavily to allow genetically-engineered plants and small amounts of pesticides into organic crops , while the meat industry made its case for factory farming methods . As proposed , the organic standards for livestock allow factory farming confinement ; non-organic feed ; the use of offal , which has contributed to " mad cow " outbreaks in England ; antibiotics ; and synthetic additives , fertilizers and some pesticides . They also go so far as to actually prohibit the eco-labeling of crops ( such as " pesticide-free " ) grown with stricter organic methods . Groups like the Organic Trade Association and Mothers and Others believe the labeling prohibition is the last straw in an already grossly flawed proposal . Farmers labeling their products as " irradiation-free " " hormone-free , " " sludge-free , " or any other such " food disparaging " label would be prohibited under the new Rule-leaving shoppers unable to tell which foods are genetically-engineered or irradiated , for instance . Laura Ticciati , executive director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USDA has sacrificed organic standards to open this market to the mainstream food industry . Why ? Because the organic market is the only segment of the food industry that is growing rapidly . Everyone wants a piece of it . " Photograph The proposed organic standards allow the use of sewage sludge , genetic engineering and irradiation. // Initial recommendations were made by the federally-mandated National Organic Standards Board ( NOSB ) , which includes retailers , farmers , consumer advocates , environmentalists and scientists . But the USDA was heavily lobbied by some powerful players , and ignored the citizen-board 's recommendations . Bob Anderson , NOSB chairman and president of Walnut Acres Organic Farms in Penns Creek , Pennsylvania , says , " I do n't think the standards will pass as is . The states are very definitely in opposition to what they perceive as lower standards . But this is extraordinarily political . We 've got the American trade office promoting genetic engineering all over the world as the be all , end all ' for the future of agriculture . We 've got the Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And we 've got the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) pushing sewage sludge as the answer to fertilizers . " Indeed , EPA Assistant Administrator Robert Perciasepe is reported to have personally asked Glickman to include sewage sludge in the new rules . Says Betsy Lydon , Mothers and Others program director and an NOSB member , " IN , Aen food is exposed to ionized irradiation , it is exposed to 300,000 rads of gamma radiation-the equivalent of 30 million chest x-rays-in order to extend shelf life and kill insects and bacteria . This amount is over 20,000 times the allowed annual exposure level for workers at a nuclear power site . The process is also known to produce new chemicals in the treated food called radiolytic products , some of which are known carcinogens . " According to the National Sludge Alliance , sewage sludge contains some 60,000 toxic chemicals , a mix of residential , industrial and commercial discharge that includes hospital wastes , street runoff , heavy metals , PCBs , dioxin , solvents , asbestos and radioactive wastes . In 1989 , the EPA also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salmonella , E. coli and Hepatitis A. In genetic engineering , scientists take the genes from one species and insert them into another to create advantageous traits , like tomatoes that are resistant to cold , or corn that 's immune to pesticides . Unfortunately , under the new Rule , consumers would have no idea that their potatoes contain fish genes or their soybeans contain Brazil nut genes-a major problem for people allergic to seafood or nuts . And according to French press reports , 1998 will have the U.S. growing 88 percent of the world 's genetically-modified crops . A staunch supporter of geneticallyengineered crops and irradiation , Glickman is seen by the organic community as riding the corporate pony " The very best science has proven the products of biotechnology and the process of irradiation not only safe , but beneficial , " says Glickman . The USDA does have some supporters . Alex Avery , director of research and education for the Hudson Institute , says , " This is the compromise you always get out of government agencies . It 's a little unrealistic for diehards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially since some producers depend on what others would consider unacceptable sources-like sewage sludge . You ca n't expect a government agency to reflect one extreme . They never do . " Corporate influence can also be seen in the livestock feed section , says Lydon , who points out that 20 percent of livestock feed can be non-organic under the Rule . " It 's the feed where you get a lot of the growth hormones and stimulants , and how animals get all these supplements and animal by-products , " she adds . So how will the new label reflect " organic-ness " ? Those containing 95 percent or more organic ingredients get the USDA seal and will be labeled " organic " on the main label . Those with 50 to 95 percent organic ingredients will be labeled " made with certain organic ingredients , " and products wz ith less than 50 percent organic items may not use the term organic on the label , but can use the term on its ingredients ' list . Says Glickman , " Consumers have shown they will pay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ensuring that consumers get what they pay for . " But the organic community asks , at what cost ? <p>
