The man at her door was bald and wore a blue windbreaker . She had asked him twice what he wanted , but he had only said , " Are you Emily Fletcher ? " as if he knew she was , but needed confirmation . <p> It struck her from the man 's salutary tone that she might have won something-an envelope was about to be handed over with a check inside for a million dollars . She was sixty-five years old . It was about time . <p> " Yes , " she said , and heard her tone cascading downward , as if she were stepping onto an unsteady footbridge over a high mountain pass . The man looked harmless enough , there in the doorway . On closer observation he seemed less sure of himself , as if he could n't quite fathom why he was there . So many things had seemed unfathomable since her husband 's recent death that she 'd begun to accept " unfathomable " as an ongoing state . <p> Emily suddenly remembered she 'd left Hanson , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her three phone calls to get a return call from him , and now the dollars were ticking away while she stood there with this awkward stranger . She looked him over again and felt the moment seize her in which women hurriedly judge a man safe with the scantest evidence-that split second in which they lunge past fears into a hastily assumed and unreliable security . <p> " Please step inside , " Emily said . " I wo n't be a minute . " She moved back to allow the man into the entry , then shut the door behind him and automatically turned the deadbolt . She knew it was crazy , to lock people in after she 'd locked them out , but at least no one else would come in . She 'd been interrupted by the telephone as she 'd been taking a quilt from its shipping package . She had draped the gift from her sister across the back of a hall chair . She left the man standing as if he 'd come to a halt before the flag of some unknown nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd sensation of being in two places at once . She heard her voice going out over the phone lines , but she was also uneasily aware that her side of the conversation was entering the acutely attentive but uncommunicative head of the stranger in her entryway . <p> " Nyal spent a month in Italy while the house was under construction , but it was n't a vacation ! " she said to Hanson . " Martin tells me this woman called him before his father died . " She revealed this almost involuntarily . Martin was their son , and she had confided unnecessarily to the lawyer during their last discussion that she feared Martin was a womanizer . She hated how she found herself blurting the most personal things to the business people she dealt with now . " It was while Nyal was very ill , and the woman must have intended to put pressure on him by calling Martin . " She paused here to calculate the echo factor of the stranger 's overhearing this last piece of information . Though what did it really matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these fragments of her life . Hanson 's incisive voice , heading for the crux of the matter , began impatiently sweeping aside what he seemed to consider mere female baggage . <p> " The legal issue is : did your husband modify , use , or appropriate another man 's house design ? And if so , is that man 's widow entitled to recompense ? The statute of limitations unfortunately has not run out on this . You 're further involved because Nyal completed this job under the business partnership you both formed to reduce his tax liability . You signed off on this work and took payment with him in the partnership . " <p> " I recall something about it , " Emily said . " But Nyal took care of all that . " She 'd signed whatever Nyal had asked her to sign . At the time they 'd formed the partnership , paper had flown by with blizzard force . But , as representative of her husband 's estate and also in her tutelary capacity as his surviving business partner , she would now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any action . The other woman , also a widow , and representing her own deceased husband 's estate in Rome , would be the plaintiff . On his behalf , she claimed part ownership in a house design . Nyal had only been asked to modify the design . The plans had resulted in a construction in Italy which Emily had never seen , but which her husband had supervised . Both men who 'd contributed to its design were now dead-her husband from cancer and the architect named Riccardo from a stroke in Rome some ten months previous . <p> During the final months of her own husband 's illness , Emily had been aware of murmurings from the widow in Rome , who believed Nyal owed her payment for Riccardo 's original design . Ultimately a letter had arrived , full of allegations . And Nyal , on his sickbed , had reasserted it was nonsense . Riccardo himself had invited him to modify the plan . Riccardo 's widow knew this all very well . It was unfortunate Riccardo was n't alive to corroborate it . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they need n't hire a lawyer in Rome . <p> For a time , Nyal seemed to have been right . They 'd had their hands full , with people coming to visit and pay their respects , once it became known that Nyal 's cancer was no longer in remission . Also , there was the finishing work on plans for the ecological center . Nyal had been the lead architect , and this project had been his final passion . All else had been swept aside so he could concentrate his remaining energies . The strange Italian murmuring had become inaudible , all but forgotten . Now Hanson informed her that yet another letter had arrived , one which framed the complaint so aggressively , he suspected it was preliminary to a suit . <p> " We may need to get representation in Rome for the estate and for you as well , if she decides to press the matter , " Hanson said . Emily tried to gauge the emphasis he was putting on the " if . " Why was her lawyer so lackluster , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the meaning lay in his sentences . Since her husband 's death , she had craved emotion in all her communications . This lawyer was an ongoing disappointment in this regard . <p> " Rome ? " she heard herself saying , like a word spoken aloud in a dream . It was as well to say Jakarta or Bandar Seri Begawan . The only personal connection she 'd had with Rome , other than her late husband 's sojourn there , was having avoided the city while she 'd traveled alone as a young woman in Europe . She had pointedly not gone to Italy when she 'd heard that Italian men randomly and impulsively pinched women . <p> " Do you think I 'll have to go to Rome ? " <p> " It 's possible , " Hanson said . " But worse things have happened than a trip to Rome . " Emily took note of a sound in the entryway and remembered the unknown man who , by now , must certainly have become restive . He might be deciding to go without having handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if Nyal were in the house . Had he been there during the time prior to his illness , he would have heard the man at the door and come down . A mere two weeks had passed since his death , and the house seemed swollen and randomly eruptive . At times it pulsed with an absence that was a kind of presence , a hum of consciousness that ran parallel to her own movements in the rooms . <p> " I 'm glad Nyal did n't have to bear this , " she found herself saying to Hanson , as if Nyal could still somehow overhear . But what she really meant was that she was sorry she was having to bear it alone . " I have to go . There 's someone here , " she said , allowing a provocative edge to slip into her voice . They agreed to speak later . She paused a moment before hanging up , hoping Hanson would give a small reassurance that this trouble was likely to subside , but he gave none . <p> She hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some still trembling fiber of her dead husband 's actions had brought them into an unfamiliar alliance . Why had he taken on the project of a house in a foreign country ? This Riccardosomeone he 'd known from his college days who 'd married and settled in Italy-he 'd involved Nyal , brought him in to solve an impasse on a project he 'd begun . She only vaguely recalled . Nyal 's expertise in the particular building materials had been important . But also something to do with an inflexible situation . Now some inflexible element had acquired another impetus . It was hardly conceivable that this had gotten so out of hand . <p> When she returned to the entryway she found the casually dressed , rather timorous man examining the quilt . Black arrowhead-like sets of V 's dovetailed down the white fabric . There was something almost cruel about the pattern , but she identified with its pain-in-flight quality . <p> " It 's the Widow 's Quilt , ' a nineteenth-century pattern , " she said to the man . " But in the quilt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " A lot of work there , " the man said quietly , raising his eyes to her with what seemed a sepulchral gaze . He let the quilt edge slip from his fingers . <p> " I do n't know quite where to use it . It 's single-bed size . " She felt at once she 'd volunteered too much in speaking of a bed to a man she did n't know . She noticed him pull nervously on his jacket zipper , running it a short way down , then up toward his Adam 's apple . There was a wedding ring on his hand . She felt herself drop her guard another notch . <p> " I have something to give you , " the man said . The insupportable idea of the prize envelope fluttered tantalizingly again through Emily 's mind . If it were to happen , it was a pity Nyal would miss it , she thought , characteristically undercutting anticipation with disappointment . The man definitively unzipped the jacket and reached inside to his shirt breast pocket . Next he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flipped it open to reveal a gold star on a dark velvet backing . It was a badge . It seemed the man was some sort of official . <p> " I 'm a United States Deputy Marshal , " he said , expertly returning the badge to his breast pocket . " And since you are Emily Fletcher , I have papers to leave with you . You 'll need to sign , just to acknowledge you received them . " He reached farther inside his jacket and brought forth a sheaf of official documents and handed them to her . She could see that everything , except the receipt form , was in another language . <p> " If you 'd just sign here , please , Mrs. Fletcher , " the man , said without the slightest doubt in his manner that she would comply . He now had the air of someone for whom these matters were beneath notice . He produced a black pen and handed it to her . She followed his index finger to a signature line , under which she saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gold star . What exactly was a deputy marshal ? She felt unable to speak the question aloud . To ask could invite a revelation as to the seriousness of the matter . Was she about to be arrested ? She wanted to flee her own house . <p> She folded back the signature page and quickly scanned the document for clues . It was in Italian , she confirmed from the legal address in Rome . Here , then , were the very documents her lawyer had feared were on the way . The word " press " came back from Hanson 's characterization of what the aggrieved woman might do . She might " press on with things . " A sexual verb , Emily thought . So here the woman was , indeed . Pressing on . It struck her oddly that the coincidence of her lawyer 's warning had merged into the arrival of the process server . It carried an eerie resonance , as if something awful were masquerading as normal , a thought she had experienced most poignantly at the moment of Nyal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush , had been so cousined to a sigh . <p> Martin had said that when the woman telephoned three weeks ago , she 'd claimed Nyal had once given her the number " in case I ever needed to reach your father . " She 'd informed Martin she would soon be taking the " necessary steps . " Evidently it had not deterred the woman to learn from Martin that Nyal was terminally ill . Only after Nyal 's death had Martin told Emily about having received this puzzling call . Maybe the woman , even now , believed and intended that her letters , followed by the serving of papers , would catch Nyal on the brink of his death . What sort of woman would do such a thing ? She never wanted to become such a woman . <p> Emily held the papers and stared at her own name-again , the feeling of forces conjoining , of her consciousness swarmed with unsought intensity . She wanted to be rid of this man as quickly as possible . She moved her hand through the deft strokes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband 's death , she and their son had only once again referred to the woman in Italy . <p> " She can claim anything she likes , now that your father 's dead , " Emily had said . " She could claim they 'd had an affair and that he promised her the moon ! " The remark had flown out of her , and she 'd reveled briefly in the absurdity of its fictional self-inflicted wound , or perhaps the wound had been meant indirectly for Martin . " To call you-she seems desperate , " Emily said . Her son dismissed the woman as the sort of person who 's delusional , who has nothing fruitful to do with her life , so she runs around , trying to extort money and to get attention by threatening to sue . He 'd met this type , he said , in his job as an insurance adjuster . Martin was forty-three , had a darling third wife and five children from his two previous marriages . He loved to evaluate propositions , buildings , objects , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into contact . Emily knew all this without surrendering affection for him . The more untrue he 'd been to his wives , the more attentive and solicitous he had tended to be toward her . It consoled her now that he seemed to give no credence to this woman 's claims . <p> " I 'm sorry , " the bald man said , lifting the stapled pages to yet another signature page . " Just here on the duplicate , if you 'd be so good : ' He pointed to a red X near a blank . Emily was n't at all sure she should be signing for these papers , but doing so was strangely as simple as the fact that the pen was in her hand . She signed again , then without replacing the cap , handed the pen back to the man . His hands , like her own , were trembling . He was also finding the encounter stressful . <p> " Now , " he said , and glanced pointedly toward the living room . " Could you tell me , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in the opposite direction toward the kitchen . " Or has he relocated ? " This second question startled her in the possibilities it opened up . She thought of the woman 's audacity in having telephoned her son , the invasiveness of her having insinuated a dispute into such a time , when her husband 's life had been reaching its final days and hours . And now this woman , who should have been in mourning , like herself , had propelled a process server into her entryway . There had obviously been some delay in the arrival of the papers , which must have been in the works prior to Nyal 's death . The U.S. Deputy Marshal probably did not read Italian and had no idea what this was about . He was restless and only half-satisfied in his accomplishment . He tucked the signed receipts inside his jacket , allowing Emily to retain the sheaf of paper in Italian . Then he regarded her , as if she were withholding something . He seemed precariously on the verge of becoming less courteous . A set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emily 's mind was speeding through the town . She could picture exactly where her husband lay-the freshly disturbed plot which overlooked the town at its eastern edge . There was only a large evergreen wreath at the head of his grave with " Nyal " and " Beloved Husband &; Father " in gold lettering on wide strands of velvet ribbon . It would be months before she arranged for the stone and decided what to inscribe on it , but there was a poem she already had in mind . It was a tanka by the Japanese poet Basho-whose poem was modeled on yet another poem sent by a woman to a man after their first love-meeting . She might use only the first three lines : <p> Was it you who came Or was it I who wentI do not remember . <p> She approved of the casualness of these lines , how they held a definitive absence in suspension , as some mere coming or going . The words would have yet another dimension , she realized , when her own remains eventually entered the plot beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still ongoing between them . Even while the poem subtracted their " remembering , " it would insist on memory all the more for anyone who paused before the stone . But most of all , she agreed with how the words cast away life and death in one fell swoop . There was something at once simple and expansive in that motion . <p> " Yes , my husband has relocated , " she said , bringing her attention back to the man . It occurred to her that although she had no control over the serving of these papers , she did hold sway over the exact moment in which she stood . <p> " Would you be so kind as to tell me where I might find Mr. Fletcher , " the bald man said . <p> " Certainly , " Emily said . She spoke clearly and decisively . " I 'd be glad to help you find my husband . " The man was clearly taken aback by her cooperativeness , as if he 'd expected to be rudely dismissed . He shifted the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedding ring over the top of his pale head and let it drop . He then shifted his feet in a maneuver that brought him backwards and into contact with the widow 's quilt . It was likely he 'd experienced harsh treatment many times . His demeanor , she saw , had visibly softened when she said she would help . He did not smile , but dropped his shoulders , which had been held high and rather formally . <p> " There 's a very nice view of the town where my husband has landed , " Emily said . She disliked the casual implication of " landed " since she and Martin had carefully chosen the site . Nonetheless , she was determined to continue in this fashion , to reveal exactly where her husband was . <p> " Oh , very good , " the man said . He resituated the sheaf of documents meant for her husband inside his jacket , then plunged a hand into his trouser pocket , jingling some loose change , no doubt an unconscious expression of delight at the surrender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on First , past the bowling alley and down Race until you come to Caroline , " she directed . The man took a small notebook from a side jacket pocket and began to scribble . " Then turn right and continue past the hospital , " Emily continued . " You 'll approach some grassy fields , then go up a steep hill . At the top you 'll find the development you 're looking for . " To call a graveyard a " development " would never have occurred to her , but she supposed death was a development . Still , her husband 's death was beyond the word in such a physically challenging way that she felt an involuntary shiver run through her . <p> " I imagine there 's a house number , " the man said . <p> " If you need assistance to find exactly where Mr. Fletcher 's situated , " Emily said , " ask at the little white house just inside the gate . There 's someone on duty until five p.m . " <p> Emily thought she 'd deflected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his watch , and Emily automatically checked her own . She saw that only half an hour remained for the man to get further help in finding her husband . He slipped the notebook with the instructions back into his side pocket . <p> " You 've been most cooperative , " he said , and glanced uncomprehendingly at the ferocious black darts of the Widow 's Quilt which , as he brushed against it , seemed to be jutting directly into him . For a moment she thought crazily that , in his mute exuberance , he intended to embrace her . The idea made her quake , as when he 'd flashed his deputy marshal 's badge . She was relieved when he reached for the door handle and attempted to let himself out . She moved near his shoulder , turned the deadbolt , and moved back so he could pass through . On the steps he paused , turned toward her , and uttered some final sentence of courtesy , then crossed the driveway to his white Volvo . She was taking pleasure in the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following her directions , this minion of the widow in Rome . He climbed into his car , then lifted his hand in a mild wave in her direction . She did not return the gesture . <p> She was thinking of her husband now , that he could not know these unpleasant things which had befallen her since his death , strangers who wanted to use his silence to beleaguer and ensnare her . Nyal would have enjoyed how she 'd just acquitted herself . She imagined them laughing about the U.S. Deputy Marshal driving into the cemetery , hoping to be directed out of a wrong turn , asking the caretaker where Nyal Fletcher " lived . " Well , the widow in Rome had misused Emily 's husband , and now Emily would make use of her messenger . The man could stand before her husband 's wreath as long as he wanted . Maybe Emily 's circumstances would prick his heart . He might fully experience the weight of his actions that day . After all , they had each been reduced to functionaries . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered the quilt so the darts folded against her breasts and grazed her neck . She carried it upstairs to the queen-size bed she now occupied alone . She spread the quilt out on her side . With the pattern unfurled , the bed seemed to be sliced in two , but the quilt gave her side fresh vitality . Even though it was hours before bedtime , she unbuttoned her dress , stepped out , then lifted the covers and crawled between the sheets in her slip . The added weight was an unexpected comfort . She closed her eyes , then eased her hand onto her husband 's side of the bed . It was cooler , and she realized that her cheeks , against the white pillowcase , were flushed . <p> She thought of the woman in Rome . What if ? she thought , and Emily smiled to recall the moment with Martin in which she had cast her dead husband into the woman 's arms , in a sentence uttered more as a challenge to the unlikely than a true possibility . But what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another woman ? How casually the thought came to her . They had been married the same forty-five years . She believed they had loved each other beyond all others . She even recalled the exact site of her faith , her steadfast belief . One night before they were to go out in company , he 'd put his arms around her at the door and said , " If I should ever say anything to annoy you while we 're out , dear , ignore it , because I adore the ground you walk on . " It was gallant and wide , and no one had said anything so beautiful to her before or since . <p> Death had added another dimension to that long-ago gift . Perhaps it was death , that ultimate release from belonging , which made even the idea of infidelity seem ludicrous . She suddenly caught a glimpse of a possibility she 'd kept quietly in reserve . She wondered if all wives held aside a reserve of forgiveness for unrevealed betrayals , believing their husbands could , in some pull of opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart ? She had put aside such a reserve , she saw , without really having had to know it , until now . Yet : so what ? <p> Prior to the Italian woman 's intrusion , which had forced her to tremble in her own doorway , she 'd had no idea of the degree to which she could still volunteer acceptance of all Nyal might have been . It was really in behalf of them both that she could manage this leap . At his death she had thought mistakenly that an end had come to the growth of their earthly loving , but instead she had stepped onto unexpected terrain , where what she held precious had become even more so . In these thoughts she was able to reach herself newly , and this both surprised and enlarged her sense of Nyal and of their life together . In her heart 's reception of all her husband might have experienced , in and out of her knowledge , she saw with an ungaugable , onrushing force how deeply she 'd loved him and loved him still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very kind , " the U.S. Deputy Marshal had said to her as he 'd gone down the porch steps . Her throat tightened now as she recalled his words . She had not been at all kind toward this man , and by now he would be realizing this . What was there in being kind when life itself and the actions of others were often monstrous ? Yet she continued to believe kindness was , when one could manage it , the ultimate checkmate , and beyond that , the one enviable gift . Yet could there be a hidden sleeve of malice inside too much kindness ? Whatever else , she 'd been true to her feeling . <p> Nyal 's silence seemed more vast than ever , and she felt included there-allowing all things to be absorbed , to coexist-fidelity and infidelity , residence and grave , coming and going . <p> By now the man had likely reached his destination . He would have come to stand before the wreath . For a moment he might have studied the name on the fluttering ribbon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and begun to walk back to his car . Perhaps he was ruefully thinking of her this very moment , of how artfully she 'd misled him . But maybe , if he had n't passed too far into disgruntlement , he might pause and look back toward the grave , realizing that , on either side of the town , they could both be faintly smiling . <p>
