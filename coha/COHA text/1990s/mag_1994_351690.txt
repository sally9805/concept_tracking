As the national symbol , the bald eagle is supposed to be the embodiment of American strength , grace and pride . But for much of this century , the majestic bird has been an emblem of the country 's careless and sometimes callous treatment of wildlife . Pinched by human population growth , poisoned by pollutants and slaughtered by hunters , the eagle went into such a decline that by 1940 Congress felt compelled to pass a law protecting the highflyer . It did n't work : in 1963 there were only 417 breeding pairs of bald eagles left in the lower 48 states , and by 1978 , when the eagle was officially listed as endangered , there were only a few more than that . It seemed that Americans would soon have to travel to Alaska , where the bird has always thrived , for a glimpse of their national symbol in the wild . <P> Now the bald eagle has come back in a big way . The number of breeding pairs hit 2,000 in 1988 , and after it surpassed 4,000 last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered-species list . Last week , in a ceremony timed to resonate with the 4th of July holiday , U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service director Mollie Beattie formally proposed that the eagle 's status be changed from " endangered " to " threatened " everywhere except in one region of the desert Southwest . At a marshy spot in Maryland 's Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge , Beattie marked the long-anticipated occasion by releasing a female bald eagle , fittingly named Hope , who had been nursed in captivity after suffering a broken wing . Following a 90-day public-comment period , the eagle can officially come off the endangered list . <P> Most environmentalists hailed the decision , though a few conservationists are concerned that the eagle 's changed status could eventually put it in danger once again . In fact , the practical impact will be minimal ; it will still be illegal to hunt or disturb eagles or their eggs . At most , it may be slightly easier to encroach upon the places where they live . Activities that threaten their habitats  --  logging , for example , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though the process will probably be less stringent and enforcement less aggressive . Says Carl Pope , executive director of the Sierra Club : " The signal is that there can be more flexibility now , not that it 's open season . " <P> Conservation groups trumpeted the eagle 's comeback as a triumph for the Endangered Species Act of 1973 , but the motives behind their enthusiastic press releases were partly political . Observes Jim Pissot , Washington State director of the National Audubon Society : " The Act itself is now endangered . " Indeed , the law is currently up for reauthorization in Congress , and property owners and developers are working hard to have it weakened . The law is unfair to their business interests , they say . Besides , they insist , the eagle 's comeback has much more to do with the 1972 banning of DDT , which weakened the shells of birds ' eggs , and with increased public awareness of the eagle 's plight than with the law itself . <P> Sympathetic legislators have introduced amendments that would give property owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House has trimmed an Administration request for increased funding that would have made it easier for the Interior Department to enforce the act . At the same time , some of its provisions have been successfully challenged in court .
