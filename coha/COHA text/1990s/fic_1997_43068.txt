THAT SEPTEMBER MY MOTHER took sick in Kansas City . I was twenty-nine and living in Utah in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains with Tom Dunbar , whom I 'd met skiing the winter before . Tom thought I should go back to see her , but I had a landscaping businessfour projects underway and bids out on three others . I had to order fertilizer and railroad ties , to oversee two or three workers at each site , to present ideas to new clients who might tide me through the winter . Besides , I did n't want to drive across Colorado and Kansas alone , and I was afraid to fly . My brother Larry and his wife lived in Shawnee , so it was n't as if my mother was n't looked after . <p> Her illness was undiagnosed-shortness of breath , dizziness , nausea , general weakness . She was in the hospital for tests and observation , and when I telephoned her , she sounded far away , but spirited . Larry checked on her every day , and she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked her-How was the weather in the mountains ? Was business going well ? How was Tom ? <p> In three days she was out of the hospital . After a week with a nurse at home , she resumed her normal routine-she shopped , went to lunch , played bridge with her friends . According to Larry , she was as fit as before . <p> But her illness lingered in me . Sometimes during workdays , stuck in traffic , I called her on my car phone . I interrupted her cooking , or her reading , or a conversation on the terrace . I was intrusive , but could n't help it . If I did n't call , I thought of her . Digging in the earth or sketching a project , I might feel a darkness surround me like clouds suddenly blocking the sun . Once in the middle of the night , Tom woke me . " You were dreaming , " he said . I was sweat-soaked , and my heart was pounding . I could n't remember the dream , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unknowable that it was about my mother . <p> The next morning I began to write things down . I was not a writer . The telephone , fast and reliable , had always been my medium . Sometimes I wrote postcards when Tom and I went rock-climbing in Colorado or to Canyonlands or Zion , and I wrote thank-you notes at Christmas , but I had never written to write anything . <p> That first time , this was what I wrote : <p> When she was a girl she had brown hair and wore it long and straight and parted in the middle . Her nose had a rise in it . Her ears were never visible . Her eyes were black . Her skin was smooth as pewter . Her body was round . Later her hair turned early gray . She still parted it right in the center of her forehead , as though her head were divided in that way-left and right . The ridge of her nose became more prominent . Her ears were invisible , always . Her eyes were black . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and strong , and in her old age she still stands up straight . Her skin is loose , splotched . Her hair is salt-and-pepper , cut at the beauty parlor in a way that covers her ears . Her eyes are pale , softer . <p> I knew there were mistakes in these lines-errors of grammar and punctuation , which I 've corrected . The writing was simple and selfconscious , though it took me a long time to write each sentence . Compared to writing , landscaping was easy . The terrain was there before I started-the slopes , the shade , the angles of light . The soils could be tested for what might grow . Drainage was a mathematical calculation . I made drawings , figured where shade was needed , where sunshine . I did n't have to lie . <p> The descriptions I had written of my mother made only passing reference to her posture and her voice . Her eyes were not black , really , but brown . She must have worn her hair in other ways . <p> One day we went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old Packard-a robin's-egg blue sedan-with my brother and me in the backseat . We picked apples , though I was too young and was n't allowed to climb the ladders into the trees . I had to cull good apples from the wormy ones on the ground . <p> On the way home , my mother sat erectly , her two large hands on the top of the steering wheel . There was a dark spot on one hand - the right one-and smudges of dirt on the nape of her neck where she had scratched a mosquito bite . She wore a blue kerchief over her black hair . The bushel basket of apples on the front seat exuded a sweet smell . While she was driving , I filched her wallet from her purse and took out all the bills . <p> Lies . It was true we went to pick apples , and I remember Mother drove the Packard , but it was n't particularly old at the time . And culled and nape and exuded were words I 'd learned much later . Filched . To write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , for instance , was a birthmark she usually covered by wearing gloves . And what shade of blue was her kerchief ? I was eight at the time . The apples could have been Romes or McIntoshes . Had my mother sat erect , or had she pulled herself forward on the steering wheel ? <p> And the omissions : How old was my brother ? He was twelve . What had he said ? I do n't remember . What were we wearing ? I do n't know . I left out the darkness . The orchard had been some distance from our house , and it was late when we were driving home . Larry had leaned over the seat to sing songs with my mother . I was on the far side of the backseat . It was darkness that let me steal the wallet . <p> Every morning at 7:00 A.M. , Tom ran eight miles . I used the hour he was gone to scratch out ideas on a pad of yellow paper . Most of what I wrote was mundane-memories from my childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years , how landscaping intrigued me for its obvious requirements . One morning , by accident , I wrote about my father . He had left us the winter I was seven , and his absence was a fact like the air . I thought nothing of it ; I barely remembered him . I had very little to say . <p> Tom came home from his run and found me weeping . " What 's the matter , Jane ? " he asked . " What happened ? " <p> I shook my head , unable to speak . <p> " What did I do ? " I turned over my pad and stopped crying , because his presence changed the room . I made coffee and waffles , and we talked about the winter 's skiing . <p> Till then I had n't thought much about my arrangement with Tom . I do n't mean I had n't thought about him : I thought about him all the time . He was a carpenter . He had a degree in history , but he liked seasonal work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I by two years , but he knew things I didn't-how to tie knots , directions to places , how to make others feel at ease . I owned the house , but we split utilities and food . Tom did repairs . He wired the garage , replaced tiles in the shower , hung new gutters . He was honest . He had a past that he was n't ashamed to reveal . He told me about a Mexican woman he 'd slept with in Oaxaca , about an episode with a woman climber dangling a thousand feet over nothing . <p> Usually I did n't think of the past , but that night , when he wanted to make love , I eased away from him . He rubbed my back instead . <p> " Are you all right ? " he asked . <p> " I was thinking about your making love with that woman in the hammock on the Spire . " <p> " That was a while ago . I 'm with you . " <p> " I know , but what you learned with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I had n't loved her , I would n't know how to love you . " <p> " Still , I wish . . " <p> " I love your hair , your eyes , your lips . " <p> He held me tightly . I knew he was with me . I felt it . But I did n't know whether I could endure the pain of knowing about the past . <p> One evening at supper Tom was telling me about a chimney route on Powder Mountain . The chimney had petered out into an overhang near the top , and he 'd spidered out in a free climb . He paused with his fork in his hand . " Are you listening to me ? " he asked . <p> " You had to free climb . " <p> " It was getting cold , and . . . " <p> I looked at him , imagined his clear , physical responses to the world , how his arms and legs reacted to problems on rock , how his body coiled and lifted in powder when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a sleep I could never reach , even after love . He took another bite of his pork chop . " You 're not here , " he said . <p> " I want you to build me a room , " I said . <p> " A room ? " <p> " A room to write in . " <p> " I was about to fall three hundred feet from this overhang . " <p> " You 're here , " I said . " So you did n't fall . " He sighed . " In case you 've forgotten , you have an office downtown . " <p> " I 'll pay for the materials . " <p> " What 's wrong with the breakfast nook ? " <p> " Too public . " Tom smiled . " No one lives here but us . " <p> " I know , " I said . <p> He built the room off the kitchen-a lean-to , really , with a desk in it and a window looking west toward the lake and the Bear River Wildlife Refuge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours I 'd spent looking for new work before I now spent in the lean-to . I wrote about the grasses turning yellow , the shadows moving toward the south , about the cloud patterns over the lake . I wrote about the bluebirds and hawks and the ancient people pushed elsewhere because the fields where they had hunted were under a sea of houses . <p> But always I came back to my family . I revised the reminiscence of the afternoon in the apple orchard and was surprised to remember Larry 's plaid shirt ( and how bright his red hair was ) , the darkness falling across a cemetery nearby , my mother 's laughter , which , after my father left , never came back to her . <p> The singing was closer to me- " Scarborough Fair " was one of the songs-but something was not right about it . <p> One day I wrote this : <p> Spring , already dark-my father took us owling . We all went except my mother . It was a school night , and she 'd argued with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sat by an open window and felt the humid air flow into the car . " The male owl stakes out a territory and calls , " my father said . He made a low , eerie whistle . " That 's a screech owl . This is a barred owl . Who-cooks-for-you ? " We all laughed . " The female decides which male is strongest , or maybe sweetest . " <p> We parked in a grove of trees at the river , and my father turned off the engine and the headlights . We got out and sat on the warm hood of the car . It was so dark we could n't see one another , and Larry flashed the light into the trees . " Turn off the light , " my father said , " and let 's hear what there is to hear . " <p> There were Whip-poor-wills and crickets and katydids . Once a heron splashed in the water nearby . Stars were everywhere through the black leaves of the trees around us . <p> We heard a screech owl across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It moved closer . " We 're in its territory , " he said . We were quiet again , listening . <p> Then my father thought he heard another owl off in the distance , and he took one of the flashlights to go look . Larry was scared and went with him . But I stayed with the other flashlight and waited for the screech owl to call again . <p> I heard it above me in the trees . " Listen ! " <p> In my lean-to room I stopped writing . I said the word aloud , " Listen . " And that 's what I had written on my yellow pad . Listen . The voice that spoke that word was not my voice , but my sister 's . Listen . Why had I not been able to remember until now , until , on my page , I was ready to shine the flashlight into the dark canopy of trees ? <p> Over the next few weeks I was quieter . I was not so eager with Tom in bed . When the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gloves , dug out the sweaters . Then it really snowed hard , and he was ready for Alta on the weekend . " Deep powder is what you need , " he said . " We 'll ski and sit in the hot tub . " <p> " I 'm not going , " I said . <p> He paused . " Jane , is there someone else ? " <p> " Yes , " I said . Tom was silent . <p> I was sad for his pained expression . It was a joke . " I love you , Tom . There 's no one else . " <p> " Then I want you back , " he said . <p> He went alone , and I spent the days in the lean-to . I watched the snowy mist fall across my window , deaden the distance to gray , blend the roofs of the houses with the air . I knew what lay in the darkness ahead of me was both beautiful and terrible , and I did n't want to know one for the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to . I willed myself to put down words . <p> We are born without choice to words and language , and language to me was like dreaming . <p> That night coming home from the apple orchard they were singing , " Are you going to Scarborough fair ? Parsley , sage , rosemary , and thyme . . . " We stopped for gas : that was how my mother discovered her wallet missing . It was my sister who had stolen it , though I was the one punished . <p> Where did my father go ? He went beyond the prairie and into the air . What have I done all these years except hold onto what is not in my grasp and wonder at what I can not know ? <p> On Monday my brother called . My mother was sick again with the same illness-shortness of breath , dizziness , nausea . She was at home with a nurse . <p> " What can I do ? " I asked . <p> " Nothing , Jane . Really . You can call her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , I was not all right . That night I dreamed of my mother , and in the morning , I left a note for Tom and I flew to Kansas City . <p> It was dusk when I arrived at her house-a red-brick with white shutters and two columns by the front door-the same one we had all grown up in . A stone wall bordered the lawn and the paved driveway , and with the leaves gone from the trees and the grass yellow , the place seemed stark and joyless . Larry 's BMW was in the driveway . The taxi let me out , and I got my overnight bag . I was surprised how cold it was for October . The wind came from a far distance across the plains . <p> I went in through the side door and stood in the kitchen , still holding my bag . I knew the sound of the clock , the configuration of the counters , the way light entered from the south and fell on the print of " Flaming June " on the wall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboard for a glass , one had to swing one 's body away from the stove . I dropped my bag and got down a glass just to hold it in my hand . <p> " Jane ? " Larry came in through the swinging door . He 'd put on weight , especially in the face , and he had done something to his hair-a new short style , or maybe he 'd touched it up . He gave me a brief hug . " You did n't have to come , " he said . <p> " I wanted to . " <p> " Mother 's asleep . Would you like a drink ? " He looked at the glass in my hand and got the Wild Turkey from the closet . " I 'll join you . " <p> " That 's where the liquor always was , " I said . Larry shrugged , got another glass and ice from the freezer , and held the bottle out to me . <p> " No , thank you , " I said . He poured his own pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . <p> " One of her bridge friends called me . She did n't show up for their luncheon , and when they phoned the house there was no answer . " <p> " And she was here ? " <p> Larry nodded . " She 'd decided she did n't want to play bridge , but had n't bothered to tell anyone else . She wanted them to miss her . " He went through the swinging door into the dining room , and I followed . The rosewood table had a bowl of flowers on it , and the crystal in the cabinet glimmered . The mullioned windows let in a pale light . <p> " Is the nurse here ? " I asked . <p> " No , I let her go until after dinner . She does n't really need nurse . " <p> We crossed to the living room , neatly arranged with flowered sofas , wing-backed chairs , a Kazak rug . Larry went to the window and opened the drapes . " Why did you come , really ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrets ? " <p> " I 've been thinking about the family . " <p> " I would n't have called you if I 'd thought you 'd come . " <p> " What a terrible thing to say . " <p> We heard my mother moving on the wooden floor upstairs , and she came down to the landing . She looked old-that was natural . Her hair was disheveled , grayer . She gripped the banister . " I thought I heard voices , " she said . <p> " Jane decided she could spare the time , " Larry said . " How long has it been ? " <p> " Four years , " I said . <p> " Yes , four years , and now she has time . " <p> My mother descended the stairs slowly . She was not a large woman . She was medium height and on the thin side , and despite her illness , she appeared to have maintained her weight . Her posture was slightly skewed , but no more so than when I had last seen her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyes were paler brown than I 'd remembered . She was the person I knew , but not the one I had written about . I embraced her gently . <p> " How are you feeling ? " I asked . <p> " I 'm tired , but all right . If Larry would n't hover , I might get better . " <p> Larry came over and helped her sit down on the sofa . " How did you sleep ? " he asked . <p> " I do n't sleep , " my mother said . " That 's the problem . " <p> " Why not ? " I asked . <p> She looked at me and said , " How is Tom ? " <p> " Tom 's fine . He 's skiing in Alta . " <p> " Does n't he work ? " Larry asked . <p> " Not in a bank . " <p> " You know Larry disapproves of your living with a man , " my mother said . <p> " I do n't want her taken advantage of , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ? " <p> " I want you to be happy . " <p> " What if I do n't want to be happy ? " <p> " Do n't you ? " my mother asked . She raised her eyes toward me . <p> " I 'd rather be honest . " <p> " Is that why you 've come to see me ? " my mother asked . <p> " Yes . I want to know about Shelley . " <p> " Who is Shelley ? " Larry asked . <p> " I heard her voice , " I said . " I remember her . " <p> " Her voice ? " My mother looked confused . <p> " She sang with you and Larry the time we picked apples . " <p> " What 's the use in remembering ? " Larry asked . " That happened twenty years ago . " <p> " I remember she said ' Listen ' when we looked for owls . " My mother sat straight on the sofa and gazed at me . " What did you do to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " It 's always been brown , " I said softly . " Shelley 's was red like Larry 's . " <p> That night I listened to the rhythms of the house . I felt the currents of air through the hallways , the way night came to every corner . I could n't sleep . <p> Finally I got up and went across the hall to my mother 's room . Her light was on , and she was sitting up in bed doing a puzzle . <p> " Did you take your sleeping pill ? " I asked . <p> " I never do , " she said . <p> " Do n't you want the pain to stop ? " <p> " Not any more than you want to be happy . " <p> I took the pillow from behind her head , shook it , and put it back again . " Why were you so hard on her ? " I asked . <p> My mother put her puzzle on the nightstand , closed her eyes , and leaned her head back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't here . I never pretended she did n't die . " She opened her eyes again . " Shelley was an unruly child . She could be cruel . " <p> " But not like Larry . " <p> " She shut everyone out . Even at school she would n't speak . " <p> " Perhaps you did n't listen to her . " <p> " What could anyone listen to ? She was in the Dark Ages . " <p> " Daddy loved her . " <p> " Your father was n't here . " <p> " She followed him , did n't she ? That 's what she wanted to do . " <p> " I do n't know , Jane . No one does . " <p> That night I woke in the middle of a dream that was true . I turned on the light and found my pad and pencil . All the way down the first page I wrote : <p> Listen . <p> Listen . <p> Listen . <p> Listen . <p> On the second page I wrote : <p> I woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off me , and I tried to find it . Then I realized the window was open and Shelley was standing on a chair in front of the moving curtains . Her white nightgown billowed around her . <p> " What are you doing ? " I asked . <p> " I 'm looking for him . " <p> I sat up in bed and pulled the quilt around me . The light of the streetlamp outside gave her red hair a halo of silver . <p> " Good-bye , sweetheart , " she said . <p> She climbed to the window sill and jumped . I heard her body fall through the trees and land heavily on the driveway . <p> I put down my pencil and wept . <p> In the morning I took an early flight to Salt Lake . I understood my mother 's illness , and she was relieved that I was leaving . I did n't say good-bye to Larry . <p> It was clear over the plains , but clouds banked in west of the Front Range of the Rockies , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gray above Salt Lake , and I knew it was snowing in Alta . Tom would be happy stuck there . When the storm passed , conditions would be perfect . <p> And I would be happy , too . I would have the house to myself , and from my lean-to I could watch the snow fall and fall through my window . I would write about my sister , gone to find our father . I would make them both alive . <p>
