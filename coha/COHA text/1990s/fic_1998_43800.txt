Rodney shifted the heavy wooden console a few inches each night , hoping the hotel manager would n't notice the newly revealed depression in the commercial-grade carpet . By the end of the week he could comfortably stand at the far left-hand side of the desk-actually a long laminated counter-and see the entire picture without distortion . He stood there now , watching the final minutes of a National Basketball Association playoff game . <p> Having decided to drop out of college at least until the fall , he had taken the night clerk job with the expectation that he would witness clandestine , even exotic behavior . At first he imagined every lone late-night arrival to be a criminal one step ahead of the law , every couple to be engaging in strenuous , costumed intercourse . Occasionally a couple checked in whom he was sure were having an affair-local address , no bags , more excited than weary-but the unresolved mysteries of the hotel 's guests soon gave way to the tedium of long , quiet hours . On a typical night he watched television until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the forested mountains beyond the opthamologist 's office across the street . <p> Rodney had briefly considered the circumstances of a woman who had been staying on the second floor for nearly two weeks . She gave a local address , and one of the maids said her room was empty except for toiletries , a few clothes , and some papers , but there was no sign of a man-or , for that matter , another woman . Rodney saw her blue sedan enter the parking lot every night between midnight and one , always from the west , not from the highway exit . She appeared to be in her sixties , and her body was heavily rounded in a way that made it difficult for Rodney to stay interested in her secret , whatever it was . From the way she walked , it seemed she meant to climb the stairs , unlock the door , and collapse onto the bed . <p> Elizabeth did not collapse but sat on the edge of her bed , ignoring two upholstered chairs flanking the small circular table centered under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become hers , the way this room had become hers ; while she had n't moved the furniture , or taken down the undistinguished landscape print of the surrounding mountains , she felt as intensely identified by this room as by any room she had ever lived in . Her feet ached , but she did not remove her shoes . Instead she took off her glasses , setting them on the bed beside her , and cupped her face in her hands . Even this room , lit by a single fixture just outside the bathroom door , was too bright , and too large ; only by pressing her hands over her forehead and eyes could she contain the world long enough to concentrate . <p> Though the effect was lessening , every night the opening of the hotel room door filled her with as much guilt as any illicit lover ever felt ; she thought of Terry 's affair , his childish , stereotypical midlife boyhood-though she was n't convinced he had felt any guilt before she confronted him . They had n't talked about when he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough . Only recently had she wondered if it would have been better to have talked it all through . In the years since , there had been a terrible vulnerability in their marriage , as if someone had let a poisonous snake loose in the house . For months you might forget about it , but one day , in the laundry room , you would catch a glimpse of mottled coils , or you would remember how , when you first moved here , there had been mice . <p> Given any opportunity , Terry would have discussed it . He believed in talking through every problem , every disagreement . Silence frustrated him . She knew how badly he wanted to explain it all , to tell her why he had gotten involved with his other woman , why he would never do it again-and , since telling her everything would relieve him , she would not let him talk . Take it with you to your grave , she remembered thinking . The memory made her shoulders knot , her forehead tighten . She had been embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refusing to believe that all the situational cliches of movies and television were coming true . <p> What she was doing now was no cliche . She had never heard of anyone doing it before . She imagined she knew how it felt to be a bad soldier : one who believed in the cause , but who nevertheless ran from battle . To add to her shame , her guilt and cowardice , Terry was quick to tell everyone that he had asked her to stay here . To lie was his idea . <p> They had known he was sick ; two years ago the doctors had n't been able to remove all of the cancer . Last month , when the dogwoods and tulips were blooming , they learned the inevitable had grown closer . " The situation , " Dr. Foote told her , was worse . They could try the chemotherapy again , but at best it would slow the disease 's progress . Rachel , who missed two classes to be there , had put one strong arm around her . Anticipating the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news came she felt strangely buoyant ; it was as if someone had just told her that the earth was inside out . As if she had stepped into a marsh and found herself peacefully suspended . Then discovered she was not quite able to walk , not able to swim . <p> Terry refused the chemotherapy . aI want to go out hairy , " he said , trying to cheer them up . " I want apple pie and cheesecakeI want a goddamned prime rib . " They talked of travel : Hawaii , Southern France , Australia , or back to Scotland , where they had spent the summer over a decade ago . " Antarctica , " he proposed . " Just to see a circle of those male emperor penguins holding eggs on their feet . " In a serious moment , he admitted he did n't want to be far from home . <p> " I could take incompletes , " Rachel told him . She was in her junior year at the state university in the city , majoring in education and theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Terry said . " But if you 'd like to come around for dinner more often , I think we could find an extra plate . " So that 's how he 's going to be , Elizabeth thought . Stoic . He had succumbed to weakness the first time ; the radiation and chemo had made him miserable . He was embarrassed about having been such a bad-scared , needy-patient . Bob Martin , one of her colleagues in the math department , had given her a quotation about " the kingdom of the sick . " It ended : " Sooner or later each of us is obliged , at least for a spell , to identify ourselves as citizens of that other place : ' <p> Those first nights after Dr. Foote quietly estimated two months , six at the outside , they stayed awake together to consider and reject traveling plans , meals he would enjoy while he was still hungry , movies he wanted to see , friends and family who should visit . Then Terry began to return to routine . He watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth-first flossing , then brushing , then massaging his gums with a special small-bristled brush the dentist had prescribed-then read around in a magazine or a book until it fell on his chest . She would prod him awake ; he would set the book on the floor , turn off his bedside light , and roll onto his side . He offered a single kiss , scented with the faint remains of aftershave or , more often now that the weather was warmer , sour perspiration . <p> Elizabeth could not sleep . After dinner she busied herself with the dishes and cleaning , then they would take a walk . She taught trigonometry and geometry at one of the county high schools , and there was grading to do . Her department was one of four statewide participating in a three-year study of the effective teaching of national standards , so two or three times a week she was obliged to log on to a computer bulletin board and correspond with other participants in the study . When she could n't concentrate on that , she went back down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others they watched television , or a movie . When the sports came on , she got ready for bed , and when Terry came to the bedroom , she pretended to read , or to sleep . <p> A woman at the hospital had given her information on counseling for family members of patients with terminal illnesses . This is what they would talk about , she thought : gathering important papers , evaluating your financial situation , learning how to take on new responsibilities . Elizabeth paid their bills and balanced the checkbook , and they made decisions about investments together . When Rachel was born , Terry insisted on buying what Elizabeth argued was far too much life insurance ; when the policy arrived , he pretended to read from the envelope : " You May Have Won a Million Dollars . " She was n't scared about money . She worried about being alone , and her worry surfaced in absurd details . He did things to the cars and lawn mower , things she had never bothered to ask about , and now it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be pruned , thinned what needed to be thinned , watered and fertilized with results such that friends were always asking him for advice . He knew how the Christmas decorations were most efficiently packed in the storage space under the stairwell , he knew what colors of stain they had used on the house and trim three years ago , he knew how to program the VCR . All things she could learn . Things she dreaded having to learn . <p> What haunted her most was his physical presence : his thin , graying hair , his crooked teeth , the mole on his neck . Even the faded paisley pajama bottoms seemed a part of his body . He breathed through his mouth , but when his allergies were bad or he slept on his back , he snored loudly . He had an office worker 's paunch , a flabby belly with an appendectomy scar . At one time or another she had had nearly every inch of his skin in her hands , on her tongue . The memory of those moments of intimacy most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as life . There was something the boys at school were saying this spring , one of those momentarily popular all-occasion expressions : Dead meat . It could be used as a threat ( You touch me again and you 're dead meat ) or an expression of resignation ( As soon as I saw the first problem , I was dead meat ) . Like a bee at a picnic , the phrase buzzed behind and beside and around every thought . She hated the way Terry looked when he slept . <p> In the middle of honors geometry one morning , she paused , exhaustion passed over her , and she suddenly had no idea what she had been saying . Angela , one of the eager front-row girls , offered politely , " You were reminding us about the theorems . " <p> What theorems ? Elizabeth thought . What class is this ? The moment , horrifying , stretched on . She thought she would have to leave the room . <p> " I 'm very sorry , " she said . " I seem to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exemplary student , suggested with great diplomacy that she had been referring to their work with triangles and cones in the fall to demonstrate the relationship of analytic geometry to demonstrative geometry . " Thank you , " she said , genuinely grateful , and went on . <p> The next day she sat in her room during her free period meaning to write comments for the awards ceremony , only to be awakened by her fourth-period class . <p> That weekend she told Terry , " I have something horrible to confess . " He had been describing his plan to kill all the grass on the slope down to the driveway and create a new flower bed . He looked up from his drawing . <p> " I do n't think , " she began , then realized what she had been about to say . I do n't think I can sleep beside you again . " I have n't been sleeping well , " she said . <p> " I know this is ungentlemanly , " he told her , " but you 've looked absolutely exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have known , but he would n't say it . She did n't want to cry . She was so tired . " Maybe it is , " she allowed . <p> Terry suggested , " Why do n't I sleep in Rachel 's room tonight ? " " No . " She spoke more loudly than she intended . She wanted to tell him , Stop being so generous . <p> She said , " You should have the big bed . I thought I 'd try Rachel 's , just until I catch up on my rest . I do n't think I told you , but Friday I actually dozed off at my desk . " She had n't meant to tell him now . <p> " Have I been snoring ? " <p> " No more than usual . I really think it 's me . " <p> Terry smiled at her across the dining room table . " I 'll miss you . But whatever , sure . Get a good night 's rest . " He picked up a catalogue . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're not going to have a chance in the clay we 've got here . With the retaining wall , we 'll essentially create a huge planter . The summer heat might be too much for them , but they should n't get any afternoon sun if this works out . . " <p> Rachel 's room offered no comfort . The past accumulated on Elizabeth 's chest the way she imagined it would if she were the one dying . Meeting Terry at school , that first awful date , the wonderful Indian dinner , seeing Casablanca in that horrible-smelling theater , his clumsy proposal , her mistake with the wedding invitations , first jobs , trying not to get pregnant , then trying to , losing the first two , finally getting all the way through with Rachel . . . why was she the one feeling this way , as if the door to the past was about to be shut tight , locked , sealed off ? Why was she the one who felt she was suffocating , being drawn toward an unavoidable horror ? Laying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child , the one who could n't understand , could n't accept the simple fact . Was Rachel thinking these things ? Rachel had forgiven Terry the affair ; did that somehow make it easier for her to accept this ? Elizabeth pictured the three of them as an isosceles triangle , then realized the sides should be uneven . Were Rachel and Terry closer to each other than she was to either of them , or was Terry the distant point ? She pictured triangles turning like images on her computer monitor , turning in space but also distorted by time . She imagined three triangles , one to represent the way each of them saw their family-or was it that she saw it three different ways ? She saw the triangles overlaid , imagined her parents , Terry 's , the other woman , Rachel 's roommate and boyfriend , the two children she had lost-all points on a star , then distinct stars , some bright , some faint . She tried to count them all . <p> She awoke without having slept . Her head ached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glaring over Rachel 's high school memorabilia . She smelled coffee , which Terry no longer drank , so must have brewed for her . Lying in her daughter 's bed , she thought , I want someone to take care of me . Repulsed by her selfishness , she rose to shower . <p> " I 've been feeling guilty , " Terry announced . Sitting on the edge of the jetted tub , he handed her a warm cup when she finished drying off . With the word guilty , the snake dropped into view . He continued , " I 'm guessing these new beds , hardscaping , plants , mulch , the whole nine yards , will run two thousand dollars . " <p> In this room , the trees in front of the house filtered the sunlight . Despite the coffee , Elizabeth felt a chill . " Beds plural ? " " Still that one area , but I 'm thinking it needs some steps . " Squinting , she saw he was cleaning her glasses for her . He held them out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my argument is that it 's still a lot cheaper than the chemo . Or a trip to the Loire Valley . However you want to think of it . " <p> Vision corrected , she glanced into the mirror expecting to see bags under her eyes . Craving sleep , she drank coffee . " You know , " she told Terry , " it 's fine with me . Whatever you want to do . " She headed toward the closet , leaving him on the side of the tub . <p> " If you 're serious , " he called after her , " I 'm going to call some people , get some estimates on the labor : ' <p> The walk-in closet allowed just one person to stand between the lines of clothes , shoes regimented below , sweaters stacked on the head-high shelf . She put her hand out , comforted by the cloth all around . She should put a pillow down in here . <p> When she came out he was sitting on the end of the bed . Their room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light angled across Terry so that his outline , particularly his head , seemed to glow . He was already gone . <p> " Sleep any better ? " <p> " It helped . " She pulled on a sweatshirt , fighting off the chill . <p> " You , " he said , " are a rotten liar . " <p> But you 've always been such a good one , she thought . <p> When that night was no different-she last checked Rachel 's clock , a wall-mounted Elvis Presley whose hips shifted with each tick and tock , at 3:45 , but doubted she drifted off before 4:30she nearly wept from exhaustion . Now the phrase that repeated itself was a throbbing I 'm so tired , so tired . It reminded her of a Beatles song , but she could n't recall the rest of the lyric . The thought of going to school the next morning was nearly unbearable . <p> " Maybe I should try a hotel , " she suggested at lunch , trying to sound facetious . She made chicken salad sandwiches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body did n't know what it wanted . Sleep . <p> " You do n't feel sick ? " Terry asked . " You are n't being a martyr ? " " I feel all " she said , carrying the sandwiches through the sliding glass door to the patio . " I 'm just- " <p> She could n't stop ; tears pooled in her eyes . " I 'm so tired ! " She sat heavily on one of the comfortless wrought-iron chairs , one of Terry 's choices . They looked like something in one of the fine homes magazines , but she had never liked them . Now she thought , I should n't have to sit in this hard chair . <p> That night , after the awkwardness of checking in , certain even the desk clerk knew what she was avoiding , she turned on the television for distraction , lay down , and woke with the alarm she almost had n't bothered to set . <p> Rachel moved back home . There was only a week left in the semester , followed by final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time near her father , but worried about her mother . Even when she was rested , Elizabeth carried a hint of desperation around the edges , a woman on the verge . She devoted herself to her work at school , staying late as extracurricular projects met their end , had the members of the math team over for their annual dinner . They finished third in the state this year . <p> Rachel had a lifeguarding job for the summer , her ongoing gig at the country club pool . The pay was good-lifeguards were in high demand these days , she had turned down a dozen jobs-but she wondered if she should n't be doing something more careeroriented by now . She thought about applying for a position as summer school tutor , but the idea of staying indoors all day was too dreary . Maybe next year . <p> She immediately understood her father 's plans for the hillside . " We can put the heathers in this fall , " he said , handing her the plant list , " but most of the perennials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peonies . But the butterfly weed and echinacea and liatris . I 'd rather let the beds settle over the winter . " He had bought a planning kit which included a large green cardboard grid , the surface treated so it could be written on with a wax pencil . The kit also included dozens of stickers , green branches on smaller and larger circles meant to represent plants . Terry , who had been a design engineer for a tool company , had carefully measured off the length and curve of the hillside and transcribed it here , to scale . <p> " What are these big ones ? " she asked , pointing to the largest circles , each penciled with a number 7 . " Dogwoods . I was thinking two white , one pink . " He had gone back and forth over the steps . In the current plan , they did n't appear . <p> " I 'll have to label all these , " he admitted . " I 've got names and numbers there on the list , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catalogues . Most of them you should be able to get around here . " <p> He was n't deceiving himself he knew he would n't see the work finished . That 's why Rachel decided she would spend the summer helping . It was impossible for her to think of preparing the ground without picturing his grave being dug , but she liked the idea that , instead of a tombstone , he would have this : not just the yard , with the footbridge he had built over the creek that rarely ran , and the hemlocks and sugar maples he had planted when he and her mother built the house , but this last creation , his attempt not at immortality-plants had their cycles , in a dozen or fifteen years the heathers would be spent-but at life transferred . <p> As Terry had feared , the best landscapers were booked at least until August . Rachel suggested that he hire strong arms and backs ; as long as he supervised , they did n't need experienced help . Reynolds , a biology major she had been seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer traveling , but those plans were stalled by lack of funds . Soon she found herself impatient sitting high in the lifeguard chair , oiling herself hourly to ward off skin cancer , watching the swimmers all around her : children hoping she would n't see them running on wet cement , some pretending to drown , some straining to dunk each other , one or two people floating , and a few calmly treading water , making slow progress against the length of the pool . At six o'clock she could put shorts on over her suit ; at home she would find Terry measuring , adjusting the strings tied to pegs across the slope , as Reynolds and Christian dug . <p> " The bottom course of timbers is the slowest , " he reassured them as the young men sat , shirtless , drinking beer from bottles . <p> " Once they go in level , we 'll get the rest up in two days , three at the most . " <p> " I need calluses , " Reynolds told Rachel , showing her his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does n't that hurt ? " <p> He held up the bottle . " I take one of these every hour . " <p> They were all inspired by Terry 's refusal to complain . Occasionally he would stop in the middle of leveling a spot , walk a few steps away , and slowly sit . Sometimes he looked down ; sometimes he rested his forehead on his knees , so that the brim of his baseball cap tilted high , revealing arches of hair . Reynolds and Christian responded by continuing their work ; when Rachel was there , if her father looked particularly drawn , she would walk over and sit behind him , put one leg on either side , and lean her chest against his back . Not today , she thought . Not yet . <p> On one of these occasions he must have read her mind . So softly she could barely hear , he said , " I 'm not going anywhere . " She could n't tell whether he was optimistic or resigned . <p> A moment later he raised his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soft creases of flesh , the mole on his left side . He said , I worry about your mother . " <p> She nodded . Then said , " She 's scared . " <p> He did n't respond . At times like this , she believed her father had secrets . Other times she knew there was nothing as simple as a mystery , no dramatic revelation . She wanted him to tell her about his parents ; his life , beginning with his earliest memory ; everything he had aspired to , every possibility he had decided against . But that was too much ; and there was no single thing she most wanted to know . She wanted what only he could tell her , the way he would tell it . She wanted him . <p> With his left hand , Terry covered her knee . Squeezed . <p> Elizabeth came home for dinner . From then until bedtime their schedule was the same as ever , except that she stayed dressed while he read , and when he finally dozed off , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it felt . <p> " You do n't have to wait , " he told her one night . " Unless , of course , you want to see the baseball highlights . " <p> Elizabeth said , " I want to be with you . " <p> Come watch the dying man , Terry thought . His anger rose closer to the surface each day . <p> He said , " Maybe we should do something . " True , his time felt precious . Even so , he liked baseball , had always liked baseball , the game without a clock , and reading the box scores did n't replace seeing the day 's home runs and final outs . <p> " Let 's sit outside , " Elizabeth suggested . " It 's beautiful out tonight . " <p> He watched the Orioles ' centerfielder disappoint Boston fans with a ninth-inning homer , then tapped the remote control . " Sure . " <p> On the patio , Rachel had been about to turn on the floodlights when Elizabeth said , " Let 's just look for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the first layers of timbers were finally straight and level . The boys were strong , but they did n't appreciate what dirt could do to a wall . If the rebar did n't extend deep into the ground , if the timbers were n't stepped slightly back , in a few years the pressure of the earth would push them forward . The boys had been impatient , but now the hardest work was finished . <p> Eyes adjusting to the dark , he looked at the curve of hemlocks around back , the rhododendron silhouette that concealed a mahogany bench . He had intended to sink a pond there , with lilies and cattails and fish . He looked up at the maples and oaks , the tulip poplar with its tall , crooked trunk . He had meant to cut that down . Poplars were fast-growing , weak , and this one was dose to the house . But there had been a poplar in their yard when he was young , and so this one lived , protected by sentiment . Was that foolish ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction ? How should he be spending this time ? He intended to make lists for Elizabeth , reminding her what to do , explaining things he had done . Was this an act of ego ? The world would go on without him . A bat flitted by . <p> Elizabeth said , " There 's the Big Dipper . " " Where ? " Rachel asked . <p> Elizabeth pointed out the arced handle , the angled bowl . " Is n't there a way , once you 've got the Dipper , to see the North Star ? " <p> That jogged a memory . " Follow the handle ? " he asked . <p> " Just two of them , " Elizabeth corrected . The longer they looked , the more stars appeared , as if their very looking created dots of light . " But which ones ? " <p> " Look north , " Rachel said logically . But now there were countless stars visible , with no telling which was the benchmark of their sky . <p> They all slouched in their chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun , or a dentist 's drill . Rachel asked , " How many constellations do you know ? " <p> The sparks above them revealed no design . Terry turned his head , wondered if that reddish one was Mars . <p> " Well , the Little Dipper , " Elizabeth said . " And Orion . " <p> How many nights had he done this ? How many times had he looked up without ever bothering to locate himself among the stars ? He remembered the childhood diversion of sitting on a sofa or bed , tilting his head backwards over the edge , and imagining the world where he would walk on ceilings , step up to pass through doors , duck under tall furniture . He remembered the sound of his mother 's old canister vacuum drawing closer , its yellow light shining as she threatened to suck up his hair . What could he have been ? Five ? <p> " Here 's what we 'll do ; he told his wife and daughter . " We 'll get a good book , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " <p> The next evening , after Reynolds and Christian had finished their beers and the coals had grayed in the grill , Rachel arrived . <p> " Hey , " she said from the bottom of the hill . " It 's a wall . " <p> The retaining wall , now two feet high and forty feet long , with angled ends anchoring it in the hill , was nearly finished . After laying the top row they would give all of the timbers a final coat of stain with the sprayer . He had bought locust , which would n't rot , but he wanted the extra protection . <p> " Do lifeguards eat tuna ? " he called as she brought two plastic bags from the car . <p> " We are n't picky , " she told him . " Around four o'clock I nearly ate a toddler . " <p> He watched the boys watch his daughter follow the brick walkway to the patio . In cutoff shorts over her close-fitting swimsuit , strong legs leading to worn sneakers , her long brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap , she looked like an advertisement for summer . <p> " I went hog wild .

" I found two computer programs on the solar system , a neat-looking old book by the guy who wrote Curious George-remember , about the monkey ? -a glowin-the-dark star chart , and another little book that tells you the names of everything . " <p> Terry looked and read the title , A Guide to the Night Sky . " Everything but a telescope . " <p> Reynolds said , " You know that camera shop in the mall ? They sell binoculars and lenses . I bet they 'd have them . " <p> Rachel put her purchases back into their bags . " More beers ? " she asked the boys . <p> Terry felt it coming , and when Rachel came back with three bottles , having already twisted off the caps , and sat casually , knees spread the way girls ' never spread their knees when he was young , the wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house , children , job , a life so long that this day , if she could remember it , would be a faint moment in the distant past . He would be memories to her ; to her children he would be photographs and occasional boring stories . Standing on the patio beside the stone wall he had built , surrounded by greenery he had planted , outside of the house he designed , he felt like a ghost . He would be forgotten the way fire forgets coal . <p> " I 'll be back , " he told them , both to remind them that he was there and to reassure himself . Sitting on the living room sofa , he gathered his strength , as he had to more and more often . He would not think this way . He would not yield to self-pity . As much as he wanted to talk about it all-the fatigue , the irrational hope , the betrayal of being eaten from the inside , the crush of regret-he would not . He would not ask Elizabeth for forgiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He would not pray , because his entire adult life he had been a nonbeliever . He would not ask why no one asked him what he was thinking . He had been genuinely relieved when Elizabeth suggested spending a night in Rachel 's room ; it was at night , after he worked to read himself to sleep , that his fate confronted him . Now he could curl on his side without worrying that Elizabeth would stop pretending to be asleep . She pretended during the day as well : she never mentioned that he stood less and less , moving from one seat to another , that he no longer reached for or held anything over his head , that his stride was shorter . He wanted to make love with her , but he refused to ask , because she could not refuse . And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me , seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered , and write them not . This was his gift to them . <p> Terry had been right : Mars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " we should eventually be able to see all of the planets except Neptune , Uranus , and Pluto .

Elizabeth had brought one of the captain 's chairs from the den . <p> " As for constellations ; ' Rachel continued , glancing at the dimly glowing star chart in her hand , " there 's the Big Dipper . The pointers , on the outside , go up to Polaris . The handle and top of the Dipper are half of the spine of Ursa Major-the end of the handle would be the tail . And Polaris is the end of the handle of the Little Dipper . " <p> " Slow down , " Elizabeth said . <p> " Little Richard , " Terry told her . " Right next to the Big Bopper . " <p> " You see Polaris ?

" <p> " Dipper , " Elizabeth corrected . " Going that way " She drew a line in the air with her finger . " As if someone is pouring something out of the Little Dipper into the big one . " <p> After installing the computer programs , Elizabeth had poked around in them . You could visit the planets , click so they slid into cutaway views , dick them into orbit , animate Saturn 's rings , learn the years Neptune was more distant from the sun than Pluto , and , disturbingly , see how the sun would eventually devour Venus , Mercury , and perhaps even Earth five billion or so years from now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view from their longitude and latitude on this very day at this very moment . In a box in the lower right-hand corner , seconds ticked into minutes , minutes into hours . Time could be sped up , reversed , or stopped altogether . The sky could be viewed from Athens or Sydney , the globe could shift to put , say , Saturn front and center . With one click , stars were labeled ; with another , the lines of the constellations were drawn ; with yet another , elaborate drawings of mythological figures appeared . Three more dicks left the stars , dots of light on a monitor , alone . <p> " And that ; ' Elizabeth said now , wishing the real sky were as bordered and orderly , " must be Cancer 's southern claw . " It was out before she thought . <p> " Where ? " Terry asked . <p> She pointed it out . <p> Terry stared at the specks of light . Then said , " Well . No hard feelings . " <p> The next night was overcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that coping with an obscured view was part of the challenge of learning the stars , but without the Big Dipper they were lost . Turning on one of the outside lights , Rachel read to them from A Guide to the Night Sky . " Listen to this : Many of the most recentlyrecognized constellations have no stories attached to them . These include Antila , the air pump ; Fornax , the furnace ; Horologium , the clock ; and Norma , the carpenter 's square : Did you guys know about these ? " She continued , " However , the vast majority of the constellations , particularly those most easily perceived by the unaided eye , carry with them tales which reveal little about the heavens , but much about those fascinated by wondrous objects afar . " ' <p> Listening to her daughter 's voice , Elizabeth found unexpected comfort . She was rested now . Each night the hotel bed welcomed her , its sheets pulled tight , the room vacuumed , a fresh bar of soap recently released from its wrapper resting by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only wanted to tell someone how angry she was . One night , searching for relevant discussions on the Internet , she came across a group of people talking about friends and relatives who had died horribly : drunken driving , Russian roulette , a brain hemorrhage . She had thought that on the computer , anonymous , she would be able to talk openly , but instead she simply lurked . It was the right word for how she felt . She recognized expressions of grief and loss familiar from bad books and television ; they struck her as unoriginal , insufficient , and true . As her daughter 's voice continued like a song she wanted to hear again , Elizabeth reached out in the direction of her husband . <p> Rachel remembered some of these stories . Reading this book 's condensed versions of myths was similar , she thought , to looking at the stars ; each chapter seemed unnaturally abrupt , but if you knew the context , there was sense to it all . Tomorrow she would buy a telescope , a strong one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before the pool opened , she and Reynolds had made love in the clubhouse . " He 's so brave , " she had told him , thinking of her father even then . Every day that summer , the title of her job mocked her . What could she do ? The wall was finished , the planting diagram complete . Terry explained that few people grew heathers this far south , but at their elevation , if the drainage was improved , and the bed had plenty of peat moss , they should thrive . The red and orange perennials would draw hummingbirds , and butterflies . She asked questions , wanting to be able to finish what he had planned . What she could n't ask him was , if her mother would n't sleep in the house now , what would she do once he was dead ? Were they patronizing him , pretending they would keep this house , that they could keep what was his , without him to possess it ? <p> Terry vaguely recognized a few of the stories of the constellations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rachel had read them an article from the paper about an astronomer who claimed to have found another sun , a sun one million times brighter than Earth 's , but so far away that it had never before been seen . How could that be ? A million times brighter than the sun , and impossible to see . <p> He had always meant to read more of the classics . For half his life he had been aware of all the pursuits that would , in all likelihood , remain unpursued . And now , when he should feel free to take risks-go hang gliding , what 's to lose ? - he had dedicated his strength to self-control . He had thought at least he could stop the damned flossing every night , even brushing ; but when he did , the next morning his teeth felt dirty . In some way he was grateful for the small irritation , the distraction . <p> Aaron , Elizabeth 's best honors geometry student , was a textbook overachiever , preparing for tests by creating his own . In three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in fifteen he would be a successful cardiovascular surgeon . Tonight he sat up in bed , eating orange slices , rereading Sir Thomas More 's Utopia , occasionally pausing to make notes . He had amused himself by removing the orange 's peel whole , then flattening it , which made him think map , and then Gerardus Mercator , the cartographer whose collection of maps was the first to be called Atlas . <p> Above their heads , beyond the trees , constant in a boundless night , the stars stood fixed by shapes they yearned to know . Cetus . Cepheus . Andromeda . <p>
