Confronted by growing violence among blacks and stalled political talks with the government , Nelson Mandela received another dispiriting blow last week . His wife Winnie is to be tried with seven other people for kidnapping and assaulting four young militants on Dec. 29 , 1988 . One of the victims , a 14- year-old antigovernment activist named James Seipei , who used the nom de guerre " Stompie Moeketsi , " was found stabbed to death eight days later . The four had fled the Mandela home after a dispute with members of the so-called Mandela United Football Club , who lived there . <P> Although the youths were abducted by members of that club , the government was leery about charging her . Officials said privately they would not do so until they had an ironclad case . The national antiapartheid coalition did not hesitate , though . In February 1989 , leaders of the United Democratic Front and the Congress of South African Trade Unions blamed Mandela for her gang 's " reign of terror " and called on activists to shun her . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife has been effectively rehabilitated by his prestige . In August she was appointed head of the A.N.C . ' s social-welfare department , a move that produced protests inside the organization . That same month Jerry Richardson , " coach " of the Mandela football club , was sentenced to death for Seipei 's murder . During his trial , the three surviving youths testified that Winnie beat them with her fists and a whip . She was trying to force them to claim that the white Methodist minister with whom they had taken refuge had sexually abused them , they said . Winnie denies the charges . " At least I will be able to stand a proper trial , " she said , " and clear my name properly . " <P> The government must now feel certain of winning its case . But if it does , and Winnie is sentenced to prison or  --  as is technically possible  --  to death , that would no longer be just a complication . It could trigger enough anger to destroy the negotiations .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
