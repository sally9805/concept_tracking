HAVING A BABY IS NO HARDER OR RISKIER THAN IT ever was . So why are caesarean sections now used in 23% of all U.S. births , up from only 5% in 1965 ? Most people have long suspected , and many doctors agree , that fear of malpractice suits haunts the delivery rooms . When complications arise , or the labor is unusually long and hard , many physicians apparently feel safer bringing out the scalpel than trying to let nature take its course . <P> But evidence linking caesareans to malpractice fears was scant  --  until a new report in the Journal of the American Medical Association . Scientists analyzed data on 60,490 births at New York hospitals and insurance premiums paid by doctors in various regions . Their finding : the odds of having a caesarean section were three times as great in areas where premiums  --  and the frequency of suits  --  were high as in regions where malpractice costs are lower . Critics charge that as many as half a million caesareans each year are medically unnecessary .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
