Without a show to call her own for the first time in seven years , television s favorite vixen , Heat her Lock lear , confronts her deepest fears about the future By Jim Calo // The cast and crew of Melrose Place gathered at the Century Club in Century City , California , in March to bid an emotional farewell to the show that had become a national guilty pleasure . After filling their plates from an overflowing buffet , the partygoers hit the dance floor and the blackjack and roulette tables that had been rolled in for the occasion . When the piles of chips had all been gambled away , Melrose executive producer Aaron Spelling climbed onstage . A veteran producer with a miles-long list of hit shows to his credit ( Beverly Hills , 90210 ; Dynasty ; Charlie 's Angels ) , he 'd hosted good-bye parties like this many times . But something was different that night-he just could n't address the cast and crew alone . So he brought up the woman he calls his " good luck charm " : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , Locklear thanked the assembled crowd and announced , laughing , " If anyone needs a special guest star , I 'm available . " The end of her reign as Melrose Place 's " special guest star " and the bitchiest landlord and advertising executive on television-has left Locklear , 37 , without a steady paycheck for the first time in recent memory . It 's certainly an unwelcome situation for a woman who once said she " could never get enough work . I always worry about work-that it will go away tomorrow or that I 'm not going to be good . " She 's been here before : With the end of Dynasty in 1989 , she found herself making do with cheesy movies of the week , an exercise video , and a forgettable role in a forgettable movie called The Return of Swamp Thing , until Spelling came calling with the sink-your-teeth-into-it role of Amanda Woodward . While Spelling may again come to her rescue , Locklear wo n't be waiting by the phone . Her latest role-that of devoted mother and wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - is clearly the one she loves most Her 21-month-old daughter , Ava Elizabeth , was a constant presence on the set during the waning days of Melrose . Whenever Locklear was doing a scene , Ava " never took her eyes off her mother , " reports Carol Mendelsohn , executive producer and writer for Melrose Place . " She even walks like Heather , " adds Melrose writer and director Charles Pratt Jr During takes , the baby would n't utter a peep . " It was almost as if she was born on that set . She must have been listening to that call , Rolling , ' in utero and knew that it meant you had to keep quiet . " Mendelsohn says Ava was born to perform : " She can dance . Melrose costar Jamie Luner incited her to do it . " Sambora would also put in the occasional on-set appearance . And though he politely turned down requests to play the guitar , his music was used over the show 's credits for three episodes .

" She deserves a lot of credit for our success , " said Courtney Thome-Smith , whose character , Allison Parker , was Amanda 's recurring victim . " She brought an element we really needed-a villain . And she brought her energy . " Yet from the start , Locklear refused any star treatment . " I 've never heard her complain about a script , " says Spelling . " I 've never heard her complain about dialogue . I 've never heard her complain to the wardrobe woman . And she 's never been late . " Instead of hiding out in her trailer between scenes , Locklear would tromp around the often heavily air-conditioned set , clad in her fur-lined boots to keep her warm . Her eating habits were another of her endearing on-set idiosyncrasies . " Heather eats the worst food in the world , " says Melrose costar James Darren , who played Tony Marlin and directed a few episodes . " I do n't know how she manages to look like that . My mother used to say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie to that . We were on the set early one morning , and they came around and asked what we wanted for breakfast . Heather ordered a cheeseburger . " " She was always eating , " agrees Mendelsohn . " During rehearsal she would sit on a little sofa near the door and eat hamburgers and fries while saying her lines between bites . " Mindful of her love of Taco Bell , the producers would order up lots of MexiMelts and soft tacos for everyone on late nights . " She was the glue that held the set together , " says Darren . " Everyone loved her ; they would do anything for her . " Darren Star , the creator of Melrose Place , could n't agree more : " She 's funny , self-deprecating , and warm . She has a natural charisma , and that 's what makes people stars . " " I think her beauty gets in the way of how people look at her , " adds Stephen Gyllenhaal , who directed her in the 1996 TV movie Shattered Mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times : " We found that the beginning of Shattered Mind just did n't work , " recalls Gyllenhaal , " but the network would n't give us any more money to reshoot it . " So Locklear invited the crew over to her house to film it again with her home video camera . " And the network never knew it . " At the start of the show 's final season , Locklear added another title to her credits : coproducer . " Knowing Heather , it 's hard to imagine her as a producer , " says Darren . " Producers are supposed to crack the whip , and that is so unlike her . But I think she did it to help the show along artistically . She wanted it to be good , unlike a lot of producers , who only care if it 's on time . " " She was like a den mother , " recalls Mendelsohn . " She wanted everyone to get along . " Locklear has come a long way since her days as Sammy Jo Dean in Dynasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the director of the registrar 's office at the University of California at Los Angeles , recommended that his daughter pose for the cover of a campus sportswear catalog . As it happensthis is Hollywood , after all-two alums of the school who were casting agents saw the cover . " They called me in and I could n't even speak , " she has said . " My voice was really high . And they said , Oh my God , what 'll we do ? " ' What they did was send Locklear out on calls for such products as Pepsi and Polaroid-commercials where she did n't have to say anything , just pose . She soon found herself auditioning for Aaron Spelling , who promptly plunked her into his hit show Dynasty then cast her in another series , TJ . Hooker , at the same time . " All the guys on the show were in love with her , " recalls costar William Shatner . " She flirted with all of us . The three male actors on TJ . Hooker were torn between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , protection won out . " Shatner wonders if Locklear paid a heavy price for achieving so much so soon . " It 's an unnatural state of affairs for anyone to get all that money and acclaim at a young age , " he says . " Heather was 20 when she came on the show . Perhaps she paid for it in the turbulence of her personal life . What you eventually learn is that it 's all meaningless-the money and the fameunless you have love in your life too . " Locklear has also acknowledged that it was a rough way to learn . " I hated making mistakes , " she has said . " When I was growing up , I wanted to be the perfect girl . That 's why I ca n't say no a lot . " Which might explain her attraction to " bad boys " like first husband Tommy Lee , the drummer for Motley Crue . " It was a way of living through someone , " she has said . " I rebelled through Tommy . could n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not forget that my dad was a colonel in the Marines . " Though Spelling admits he was shocked by her wild streak ( on meeting Lee , he has said , " I almost had a heart attack " ) , he believes it adds to her talent . " You 'd think Heather came from Iowa and was so sweet and innocent that she should star in Little Women , " he once joked . " But she has a streak that likes fast cars and tattoos and rock stars . It 's what makes her a good actress-she wants to experience life .

" Even so , she has admitted , " I think I 've learned from Amanda . She does things I would n't do . " Perhaps that 's why she was " wild about playing a bitch , " as Spelling once put it . " Amanda came along at a time in my life when I needed to confront myself and other people , both personally and in business , and say things that I would normally be afraid to say , " Locklear has said . " This character has helped me to be strong . " That strength sustained her while she went through rocky times . After a highly public split from Lee , a friend fixed her up with Sambora ; they married less than a year later . The divorce from Lee had n't made her gun-shy , Locklear said , only more determined to make a marriage work and have children . In the aftermath of the divorce , " I did n't know if I 'd ever fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At first I was a little pathetic . I thought , I 'll just take what comes along . That lasted about a minute . Then I was just testing myself to find out who I really was and what I really felt , rather than keeping everything inside . I was never good at communicating my feelings , confronting people . But divorce made me see what I wanted . " Early in her relationship with Sambora , she said , " I do n't even know if it is love , but I know compatibility and who I am and who he is . We 're the same , we 're not opposites . We mirror each other . So it 's not so much that I know I 'm in love now , it 's that the second time around I know what I want . And I know it 's not just lust .

He even serenaded the baby while she was still in the womb . " He was very sweet , " she recalled shortly after the birth . " During those 35 hours , he went out and bought a rose for me and a rose for the baby . " Locklear noted that Ava inherited her nose and her mouth . But as a newborn , " She had a round face , and that 's more like Richie . And she came out with really big feet . I said , Oh , Richie , that 's what she got from you , big feet . " Rumors abound about Locklear 's next move : another TV series , a feature film , more modeling for L'Oreal . In one version of the series finale of Melrose Place ( which had n't aired at press time ) , her character faked her own death and then snuck off with one of her ex-husbands . Was this one of those Dallaslike endings , which would allow the show 's creators to bring Amanda back someday in her own series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quick to say he 'd cast her again . " Hell , yes , although it would have to be a show worthy of her . " In the past , Locklear has entertained the idea of going back to school or moving into comedy . " It would be fun to be a kook , a nut , " she has said . " She 'd be great in a comedy , " Spelling says . " I 'd have thought every studio in town would have a holding deal with her now . But I do n't know how much she wants to work now , what with the baby and all . " " I think the hardest lesson I 've had to learn is not to put all your eggs in one basket , " Locklear said after she landed the Melrose gig . " Things change from one day to the next . I 'm very lucky . The good that I 've had so far outweighs the bad . I know that this go-round with my career , that it could go away tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind that if it all goes away tomorrow , I may have another chance . " We 'll be waiting .
