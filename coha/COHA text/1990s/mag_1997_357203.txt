Between 1992 and 1996 , 64 men and women in Norway quietly died . Their passing was noted by their families but otherwise was largely unremarked . All the deceased , after all , suffered from heart disease , and many had undergone bypass surgery . Deaths like these are not the stuff of headlines . <P> Last week , however , the dead Norwegians made the evening news . What all of them had in common , in addition to sickly hearts and premature deaths , was elevated levels of an amino acid called homocysteine . The patients were part of a study , published in the current issue of the New England Journal of Medicine , that shows an almost lockstep correlation between high homocysteine levels and coronary-disease mortality . And that paper follows more than 50 less publicized studies since 1992 suggesting similar connections . <P> What makes this research so compelling is that unlike cholesterol , which everyone knows is associated with coronary problems but can often be treated only by medication and a rigid diet , homocysteine appears to respond to nothing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamins . Homocysteine is certainly not the lone gunman of heart disease , but the studies strongly suggest that it 's at least a co-conspirator  --  and one that patients can do something about . " This is very convincing , " says Dr. Jacob Selhub of Tufts University in Boston . " Homocysteine appears to be a risk factor for heart disease . " <P> To a few doctors , homocysteine is nothing new . As long ago as 1969 , Harvard physician Kilmer McCully  --  now with the Veterans Administration Hospital in Providence , R.I.  --  was studying the unusual case of an eight-year-old boy who had died of a stroke . McCully found that the boy 's bloodstream was fairly awash in excess homocysteine and that his arteries had the sclerotic look of an elderly man 's . <P> Ordinarily pretty harmless stuff , homocysteine is used by the body to help manufacture proteins and carry out cellular metabolism . Too much of it , however , appears to cause blood platelets to clump together and vascular walls to begin to break down . In older patients , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thickened texture that provides circulating cholesterol with a place to stick and grow . In the young boy , accelerated homocysteine production caused by a genetic defect apparently led to accelerated damage . In both instances , however , McCully points to the same chemical culprit . " The underlying cause of heart disease , " he says , " is an imbalance in the system that controls homocysteine levels . " <P> Superficially , at least , the New England Journal paper appears to confirm this . The study , conducted at Haukeland University Hospital in Bergen , Norway , surveyed 587 people with a history of heart trouble . The 64 who died during the course of the research were among those with the highest levels of homocysteine in their blood . Overall , the research suggested , people with elevated homocysteine are 4 1/2 times as likely to die of heart disease as those with normal levels .
