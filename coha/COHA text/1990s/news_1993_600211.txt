<p> Tom and Elsa Angell loved the day they took a rental car in Italy and roamed through wine country . But six months later , that little side trip cost them an additional $ 56 . <p> A bill arrived at their Falls Church , Va. , home last spring with a messy note in Italian " proof " of an alleged moving violation committed in Italy . <p> " American Express enclosed a letter saying , ' The Italian police have found you guilty and to expedite this we have paid the bill for you . Please remit . ' I still do n't know what I did but I know I spent $ 56 for it , " says Tom Angell . <p> Ah , the hassles of renting a car abroad . Foreign driving laws . Gasoline at $ 4 to $ 5 a gallon . Mandatory theft insurance in places like Naples where your car might disappear while you sip espresso . <p> So why not just give up and take the train or bus tours ? <p> " If you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you might find a train that goes in the vicinity but how are you going to go the last five miles ? Sometimes you just want a car , " says Paul Grimes , consumer columnist for Conde Nast Traveler . <p> And renting cars in Europe is becoming less intimidating as 70% of U.S. travelers to Europe are repeat visitors and many are experienced renters . <p> For many people , the questions are n't whether to take a car but how to save money and avoid aggravation . Suggestions from the experts : <p> Price shopping <p> Ed Perkins , editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter , compared U.S.-based multinationals Hertz , Avis , National and Budget with the three major European wholesalers Kemwel , Auto Europe and Europe by Car ( all have toll-free numbers in the U.S. ) . <p> His conclusions : " No one company is consistently lower than any other . It varies from country to country , week to week , even from model to model . " <p> Whatever car you pick , get the rates guaranteed in dollars and ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . For example , under Hertz 's Affordable Europe program , you can save up to 40% if you pay at least two weeks in advance ( until March 31 ) for travel between April 1 , 1993 , and March 31 , 1994 . <p> Also , airlines and tour companies that package airfare and lodging can knock 10% or more off rental car costs . Unless you have a cut-rate airfare or use frequent flier miles , a package may be your best deal , says Perkins . <p> Taxes <p> Brace yourself . Value added taxes on rental cars in Europe can be double or more the U.S. rate . <p> A sampling : Germany , 14% ; England , 17.5% ; Italy 19% ; France 22% ; Belgium and Denmark , 25% . Switzerland and most eastern European nations do n't have VAT . <p> But unless you want to vacation in or near a no-tax country , detouring to rent in one may be a false economy , says Perkins . <p> The base rates on rental cars in no-tax countries may be as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the VAT . And you waste valuable time ( plus meals , gas and tolls ) going to and from your real vacation destination . <p> Insurance <p> You must have collision damage , liability and theft insurance . You 'll pay $ 9-$ 15 per day in Europe , depending on the car model you rent and where you rent it . <p> Your auto insurance policy at home wo n't cover you overseas , says Perkins . Certain credit cards provide overseas rental car coverage but you should double-check to be sure your card offers this benefit . <p> If not , buy the insurance and save yourself a battle later . Clerks at rental car outlets can put a hold of $ 10,000 or more ( the value of the car ) on your credit card if you refuse the insurance or ca n't prove you 're covered . <p> Buy the insurance in advance , says Perkins , and you might get a discount . Hertz , for example , cuts the cost 20%-40% if you pay for it at least two weeks ahead . <p> Unfamiliar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars are only about 20% of the fleet in Europe . An automatic will cost 50% more for the same car , and you may be forced to bump up to a bigger , more expensive car . <p> Anyone who 's crunched into a European compact can testify that cars are smaller there . Rental companies did n't dispute a wry rule of leg room given by travel columnist Peter Greenberg : " Their idea of an intermediate car is our idea of a compact . Assume that whatever size they tell you is one size smaller than you need . " <p> See Europe by rail and road If you want the freedom of a car , the ease of a train and maximum bang for your transportation bucks in Europe , consider combining driving with train travel . <p> " The ideal compromise , " says Ed Perkins of Consumer Reports Travel Letter . " Rail passes that include three or four days of renting a car to save hassles , time and money . " <p> The Eurail/drive program started in ' 91 and sales jumped 92% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the U.S. sales offices for Eurailpass . Rail Europe also sells national and multinational rail/drive packages for France , Britain-France , Germany , Greece , Spain , Portugal , Switzerland and Scandinavia and others . <p> Flexible features : You can book on short notice and you do n't have to use all your car or train days in a row . Prices for summer ' 93 are up slightly over last year and the package must be purchased before leaving the USA . <p> Solo travelers beware : Prices are markedly higher . The best deals are for two people traveling together . <p> Sample packages and prices for a subcompact , standard transmission car : <p> Eurail/drive Four days train/three days car rental within two months , good for travel in 17 countries ; $ 289 per person for two traveling together ( $ 375 for singles ) . <p> France only rail/drive Three days train/three days car ; $ 189 first-class rail for two persons traveling together ( $ 285 for singles ) ; $ 149 second class ( $ 235 singles ) . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much it costs to rent a car <p> Rental car prices in Europe this summmer range from bargain 's in Germany to rates in Finland at twice the general prices elsewhere in Europe . Here 's a sampling of the best deal for one week in August on a four-door intermediate car ( four adults , three suitcases ) with manual transmission and unlimited mileage . Prices include each country 's value added tax but not insurance , airport or anti-theft surcharges . All but Avis require partial or full prepayment for lowest rates . Budget Hertz(1) Avis Auto Europe ( midsize car ) France $ 466 $ 360 $ 401 $ 376 Germany $ 244 $ 213 $ 294 $ 296 England $ 362 $ 278 $ 310 $ 316 Italy $ 395 $ 369 $ 337 $ 427 Finland $ 745 $ 706 $ 831 $ 609 1 - Paid in full by March 31 for travel before April 1994
