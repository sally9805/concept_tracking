<p> Angel wants to be a police officer when he grows up . The 17-year-old junior works in an office at Mission High School , does his homework at night and awakes before sunrise to help his father deliver newspapers . <p> Angel also is a leader of a youth gang . Four hours a day , he wears brown Ben Davis slacks and a bandanna , uses a hand signal  --  raising the index and pinky fingers  --  and hangs out at a playground three blocks from the Mission Police Station . Sometimes he beats up other boys . <p> Most of the time , Angel , who did not want his real name used , thinks about dying . <p> On January 11 , a few days after he testified against two rival gang members in a robbery trial , he was walking with his gang at the corner of Valencia and 21st streets when a car abruptly stopped . <p> Someone with a pistol stepped out and Angel scrambled to safety . But Bayron Alvarado Martinez , 13 , tripped and fell . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " said Angel , whose gang had initiated Bayron just a few hours before he was gunned down . <p> The slaying  --  one act in a series of increasing gang-related incidents  --  forced political and community leaders to focus on a group of new Latino gangs that have sprung up in recent years . <p> The Mission 's six known gangs have an estimated 300 to 500 members  --  a small percentage of the city 's Latino youth population . According to social service workers and community leaders , these disenfranchised and frightened teenagers are clinging together for reasons far different from the gang alliances of the past four decades . <p> They are younger , poorer and generally more frustrated . Many have come to San Francisco with violent memories from war-torn Central American countries , of- ten entering the United States illegally . And their numbers are rising . <p> Once here , they remain isolated , untouched by the few social service programs available . Many join gangs reluctantly , responding to the false belief that they must belong to a gang to survive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done in the ' 50s , and it 's outdated , " said Guillermo Rodriguez , director of policy and research at Latino Issues Forum , a San Francisco public policy center . " Gang formation has shifted . There are a lot of other social factors causing these children to form these groups . " <p> Traditionally , young men in the Mission banded together for social fulfillment , typically concentrating activities on automobiles and girls . They were identified by the name of their gang , their own nicknames and the clothes they wore . Some carried knives and chains , fought one another and committed such serious offenses as robberies and car thefts . <p> In some respects , Mission gangs have not changed . But the six gangs that dominate the Mission now base alliances largely on nationality rather than neighborhoods . These new gangs are based mainly along Mexican , Nicaraguan and Salvadoran lines  --  a result , some say , of a decade-long influx of Central Americans who typically are splintered from the older , established Mexican community . <p> Not infrequently , the troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results are homicides and injuries caused by drive-by shootings . <p> A QUESTION OF SURVIVAL <p> " Twelve years ago , gangs were associated with car clubs , low-riders , cholos and home boys , " said Mario Paz , a criminal justice specialist in Mayor Frank Jordan 's office . " It 's not about fun anymore . It 's about survival . " <p> Survival is the reason Angel and 10 other youths huddled in a playground one day last June and decided to call themselves a gang . <p> " We were having problems with these other guys , " Angel said . " We were scared . " <p> As members of a pack , the boys felt less intimidated and stronger . <p> " If something happens , my friends are there , " Angel said . " They can fight . " <p> In a matter of weeks , an estimated 50 youths approached Angel and his friends for membership , agreeing to be punched for 11 seconds in an initiation rite conducted by two gang veterans . <p> " ( Latino ) gangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said police Sergeant David W. Horton , who has investigated Latino gang crimes for 11 years . " They 're not like Compton 's or Oakland 's gangs who fight over who 's going to control narcotics or extortion . Here it 's a macho , tough-guy thing . Who 's tougher ? They 're always fighting for that No. 1 spot . " <p> Roberto Campos , 18 , joined a gang two years ago and then quit Wilson High School after his friends pressured him into spending more time on the streets . Now , he is unemployed , lives with his parents and passes time guarding his gang 's territory around 26th and Mission streets . <p> " If they cross out our graffiti , we fight , " Campos said . " If they yell out their gang name while we 're walking , it 's a challenge to fight . It 's them thinking they 're better . " <p> NEW FACES IN THE MISSION <p> An estimated 300,000 immigrants from Central America have moved to the Bay Area during the past decade , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a third-generation Nicaraguan American who runs an immigration consulting service from his Potrero Street office . <p> " The poorest of the poor of these kids are in the Mission , " Lacayo said . " They 're coming in from ( being ) dirt poor in the Third World country to poor in the United States , and they want to be part of this society . But where are the Hispanic role models ? The doctors and teachers , the lawyers ? <p> " It 's just natural that these kids will flock together . The gang offers the kids comfort , security and identification that they 're not getting anywhere else . " <p> The new wave of immigrants diversified the once mostly Mexican face of the Mission , heightening a deep-rooted friction among different Latino nationalities . <p> The friction has erupted into gang rivalries , which police blame for Bayron 's death . A reputed member of a competing gang , Juan Carlos Sanchez , 19 , is scheduled to enter a plea in the slaying in San Francisco Municipal Court tomorrow . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said Paz of the mayor 's office , but perhaps is a result of differing political and religious ideologies . He said one thing has become clear , however : " It 's time for us to come together . It does n't matter what country you come from . " <p> ' A CERTAIN COHESIVENESS ' <p> Mitchel Salazar , director of RAP , the Real Alternatives Program , a city-sponsored youth center , said Bayron 's slaying has prompted a new drive to help troubled youths . <p> " I think it 's terrible and it 's tragic that this 13-year-old boy was killed , " said Salazar . " But the tragedy brought a certain amount of cohesiveness . " <p> Since the teenager 's death , Salazar said , his group and the city have been reviewing plans that include increased recreational activities , a reinstituted curfew , improved police cooperation with the community , mental health counseling and an attempt to get the business community to finance special activities for youth . <p> " People have to understand . . . these kids are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure they 're included , " Salazar said . <p> Leonardo Alvarado , for one , likes the idea . <p> Alvarado , 19 , has scars on his knee , thigh and face from gunshot wounds in two gang warfare incidents last year . <p> He was luckier in El Salvador , which he left at age 15 after guerrillas shot at him and missed . They continued to pursue him because his brother was a soldier . His mother is still there . <p> Nowadays , he said , his main goals are to pass a high school equivalency test , to learn better English and to stay alive . Then , maybe , he can get a better job and help his mother have a better life . <p> When asked whether increased services to youths would alleviate some of the violence , Alvarado smiled , a boyish smile , and said softly : " Si . Que bueno . "
