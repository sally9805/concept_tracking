<p> The following is taken from the Department of Energy 's recently updated Insulation Fact Sheet , which was prepared by Oak Ridge National Laboratory . The full article contains more specific guidance for determining recommended insulation levels for the area where you live , and your home in particular . If you have access to the World Wide Web , you can find this information at Oak Ridge 's site ( www.ornl.gov/roof+wall. ) or DOE 's Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Program 's site ( www.eren.doe.gov ) .

Much of the existing housing stock in the United States is not insulated to the best level . Older homes are likely to use more energy than newer homes , leading to very high heating and air conditioning bills . Even if you own a new home , adding insulation may save enough money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years , continue to save you money for as long as you own the home , and increase the resale value of your house . <p> It is possible to add insulation to almost any house . You may be able to do the job yourself if the structural framing is accessible  --  for instance , in unfinished attics or under the floor over an unheated space . Or you may prefer to hire an insulation contractor . In either case , it is important to choose and install the insulation correctly . <p> The amount of energy you conserve will depend on several factors : your local climate ; the size , shape , and construction of your house ; the living habits of your family ; the type and efficiency of the heating and cooling systems ; and the fuel you use . Once the energy savings have paid for the installation cost , energy conserved is money saved  --  and the annual savings will increase if utility rates go up . <p> How Does Insulation Work For You ? Insulation is rated in terms of thermal resistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow . The higher the R-value , the greater the insulating effectiveness . The R-value of thermal insulation depends on the type of material , its thickness , and density . In calculating the R-value of a multi-layered installation , the R-values of the individual layers are added . Installing more insulation in your home increases R-value and the resistance to heat flow . <p> The effectiveness of an insulated wall or ceiling also depends on how and where the insulation is installed . For example , insulation which is compressed will not give you its full rated R-value . Also , the overall R-value of a wall or ceiling will be somewhat different from the R-value of the insulation itself because some heat flows around the insulation through the studs and joists . That is , the overall R-value of a wall with insulation between wood studs is less than the R-value of the insulation itself because the wood provides a thermal short-circuit around the insulation . The short-circuiting through metal framing is much greater than that through wood-framed walls ; sometimes the metal wall 's overall R-value can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful design , this short-circuiting can be reduced . More information about whole-wall R-values can be found on the Home Energy Saver Web Project at **35;882;TOOLONG . <p> Does Your Home Need More Insulation ? To begin to answer this question , you must first find out how much insulation you already have and then determine how much more would be cost-effective . Many older homes have less insulation than homes built today . A qualified home energy auditor will include an insulation check as a routine part of an energy audit . For information about home energy audits , call your local utility company . State energy offices are another valuable resource for information . An energy audit of your house will identify the amount of insulation you have and need , and will likely recommend other improvements as well . <p> If you do n't have someone else inspect your home , you 'll need to look for insulation in several places . For instance , in a typical house , insulation should be installed in finished and unfinished attics , along all exterior walls , and over floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garages . These are the areas you should check . In each location , you 'll need to measure the thickness of the insulation and identify which type of insulation was used . <p> Your home may have one or more of several different insulation materials . Mineral fiber insulation , including fiber glass and rock wool , is produced from either molten glass , slag , or rock . Fiber glass insulation is usually very light-weight , and yellow , pink , or white in color . Fiber glass can be found in loose-fill and blanket , either batt or roll , forms . Rock wool loose-fill is usually more dense than fiber glass , and is most commonly gray with black specks . Some rock wool products , however , are near-white . Loose-fill cellulose insulation is commonly manufactured from recycled newsprint , cardboard , or other forms of waste paper . Most cellulose is in the form of small flat pieces rather than fibers . However , some cellulose products are so finely divided they look fibrous as well . Vermiculite- and perlite-loose-fill products are no longer commonly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an older home . They are produced by expanding naturally-occurring minerals in a furnace . The resulting granules are non-combustible and are commonly poured-in-place . <p> First , check the attic ; then check walls and floors adjacent to an unheated space like a garage or basement . In these places , the structural frame elements ( the ceiling joists or wall framing boards ) are often exposed , making it easy to examine the insulation ( if any ) and to measure the depth or thickness of the insulation . It is more difficult to inspect finished exterior walls . One method is to use an electrical outlet on the wall , but first be sure to turn off the power to the outlet . Then remove the cover plate and shine a flashlight into the crack around the outlet box . You should be able to see whether or not insulation is in the wall . You may need to pull a small amount out to determine which type of material was used . Also , you should check separate outlets on the first and second floors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because wall insulation in one wall does n't necessarily mean that it 's everywhere in the house . An alternative to checking through electrical outlets is to remove and then replace a small section of the exterior siding . <p> Next , inspect and measure the thickness of any insulation in unfinished basement ceilings and walls , or above crawl spaces . If the crawl space is not ventilated , it may have insulation on the perimeter wall . If your house is relatively new , it may have been built with insulation outside the basement or foundation wall . However , this insulation would not be visible because it would be covered by a protective layer of stucco , plastic , fiber glass , metal flashing , or a rigid protection board . The builder or the original homeowner may be able to tell you if such exterior insulation was used . <p> Compare your findings with recommended levels of insulation by following the steps described next . <p> R-Values For Existing Houses . The amount of insulation you need depends on the climate , type of heating ( gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the house that you plan to insulate . The attic is the first area to consider because it is accessible and therefore less expensive to insulate . <p> A computer program is available at the aforementioned Home Energy Saver Web Project to help you calculate the amount of insulation appropriate for your house . This program will run on a personal computer . It is called the ZlP-Code because it includes weather and cost information for local regions defined by the first three digits of each postal service zip code . The program also allows you to define your own local costs and certain facts about your house to improve the accuracy of the recommendations . <p> The amount of money you are willing to invest in insulation will of course depend on your personal finances . But remember that the initial investment will pay for itself in reduced energy consumption , particularly where the amount already installed is substantially less than recommended . If fuel and electrical power costs rise , it will make even more sense to invest in insulation . If you are financing a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to check to see if banks in your area allow larger loan amounts for energy-efficient housing . <p> Prevent Moisture Accumulation . Moisture control is a major concern associated with installing thermal insulation . The warm air inside your house contains water vapor . If this vapor passes into the insulation and condenses , it can cause significant loss of insulating value . If moisture becomes deposited in the building structure , it can cause mold growth , peeling paint , and eventual rotting of structural wood . To guard against moisture problems , use vapor retarders and provide adequate ventilation for the house . If you have a crawl space you should place a vapor retarder on the ground surface . <p> Vapor retarders should be used in most parts of the country . More detailed guidance on regional differences in moisture control recommendations can be found in the U.S. Department of Energy 's Moisture Control Handbook. * <p> Batts and blankets can be purchased with a vapor retarder attached . However , if new material is being added to insulation already in place , use batts or blankets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type is not available , be sure to remove the vapor retarder facing ( or slash it with a sharp knife ) between layers of insulation to allow any moisture which does get into the insulation to pass through . <p> For loose-fill insulation or for batts and blankets not having an attached vapor retarder , heavy-weight polyethylene plastic sheets are available in rolls of various widths for use as vapor retarders . In places where vapor retardant materials can not be placed , such as in finished wall cavities being filled with blown-in insulation , the interior surface of the wall can be made vapor-resistant with a low-permeability paint , or with wall paper that has a plastic layer . <p> What Kind of Insulation Should You Buy ? Once you have located the areas in your house requiring insulation , and have determined what R-value is needed , you will need to decide what type to buy . Some types of insulation require professional installation , and others you can install . You should consider the several forms of insulation available , their R-values , and the thickness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of insulation , the thicker it is , the higher its R-value . The basic forms of thermal insulation are listed in Table 1 opposite , on pg . 28 . <p> Make Your Selection . The type of insulation you use will be determined by the nature of the spaces in the house that you plan to insulate . For example , since you can not conveniently " pour " insulation into an overhead space , blankets , spray or board products , or reflective systems are used between the joists of an unfinished basement ceiling . The most economical way to fill closed cavities in finished walls is with blown-in insulation applied with pneumatic equipment or with foamed-in-place polyurethane foam . Table 1 provides a concise summary of the appropriate applications for the various types of thermal insulation . <p> It is important to know that the different forms of insulation can be used together . For example , you can add batt or roll insulation over loose-fill insulation , or vice-versa . Usually , material of higher density ( weight-per-unit volume ) should not be placed on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so will reduce the thickness of the material underneath and thereby lower its R-value . <p> In cold climates , some low-density loose-fill insulation allows air to circulate between the top of your ceiling and the attic . This air circulation can decrease the effective thermal resistance of the insulation and may be significant for regions with more than 5,000 heating degree days , or north of a line running from New York to Pittsburgh to St. Louis to Topeka to Santa Fe to Reno and up to Portland , Oregon . You can eliminate this air circulation by covering the loose-fill insulation with a blanket insulation product or with a higher density loose fill insulation . <p> Check the Label Before You Buy . No matter what kind of insulation you buy , check the information on the product label to make sure that the product is suitable for the intended application . A good insulation label should have a clearly stated R-value , and information about health and safety issues . An informative label should state : <p> The type of insulation material ; <p> The R-value ( measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces that can be insulated ; <p> Safety precautions in application and use , including any fire-hazard related restrictions ; <p> The quantity in the package ; <p> The name and address of the manufacturer or distributor . <p> Can You Do It Yourself ? Whether or not you install the insulation yourself depends on the structural design of your house and the type of materials used in its construction . <p> In existing buildings , installing insulation in the cavity of exterior walls is difficult . It usually requires the services of a contractor who has special equipment for blowing loose-fill insulation into the cavity through small holes cut through the sidewall , which later are closed . It is sometimes feasible to install rigid insulation on the outdoor side of masonry sidewalls such as concrete block or poured concrete . When new siding is to be installed , always consider adding thermal insulation under it . Generally the services of a qualified contractor are needed to make such installations . <p> The homeowner can often insulate basement or crawl space walls , or floors over unheated areas , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also available for these locations , but would require a qualified contractor . If you insulate a floor above a crawl space , all ducts and water lines running below the insulation should be insulated as well . Insulate crawl space walls only if the crawl space is dry all year , the floor above is not insulated , all ventilation to the crawl space is blocked . and a vapor retarder ( e.g. , heavy-weight polyethylene film ) is installed on the ground to reduce moisture migration into the crawl space . The Builders Foundation Handbook ( ORNL/SUB-295 , see footnote , pg . 26 ) is a complete guide to foundation insulation , including basement , crawl space , and slab insulation . <p> For a detailed description of installing various forms of insulation yourself , contact the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Clearinghouse at ( 800 ) 363-3732 or go to the Web site at www.eren.doe.gov . <p> If You Have It Done Professionally . Do not be surprised to find the quoted prices for a given R-value installation to vary by more than a factor of two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R-values . Do n't forget that R-values are determined by material type , thickness , and installed weight per square foot , not by thickness alone . <p> Each bag of insulating material used by the contractor should be marked with an R-value for the area to be covered . Although these figures may differ among manufacturers , the area figure will tell you the right number of bags to be used for loose-fill . Similarly , packages of other types of insulation should be identified by their R-value . It is important that you check that the proper amount is installed in your residence . Ask the contractor to attach vertical rulers to the joists prior to a loose-fill installation in your attic to help you see that the proper depth was installed . Also , the installer must provide a signed and dated statement describing the insulation installed , stating thickness , coverage area , R-value , and number of bags installed . In some areas , infrared thermography services are offered to help discover any gaps in the insulation . <p> Consumers may want to have their attic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for . You can evaluate batt insulation installation by measuring the batt thickness and by checking for gaps between batts . " Cookie cutting " is the **30;919;TOOLONG procedure of evaluating installed loose-fill insulation . Many independent ( third-party ) firms offer " cookie cutting " services to homeowners throughout the country . Contact the Insulation Contractors Association of America at ( 703 ) 739-0356 for a list of firms that offer these services ; they can also provide you with brochures and fact sheets about inspecting your insulation job . Insulation Priorities <p> It is most important to : <p> Insulate your attic to the recommended level , including the attic door , or hatch cover . <p> Provide the recommended level of insulation under floors above unheated spaces , around walls in a heated basement or unventilated crawl space , and on the edges of slabs-on-grade . <p> Use the recommended levels of insulation for exterior walls for new house construction . When remodeling or re-siding your house , consider using the levels recommended for new construction in your existing walls . <p> * Available from Oak Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
