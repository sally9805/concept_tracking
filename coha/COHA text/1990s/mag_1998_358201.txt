Back in 1982 , a brash newcomer called Compaq Computer sprang up to clone IBM personal computers . Last week Compaq became a virtual clone of IBM , the company . The computer maker will pay some $9 billion for Digital Equipment , a dented dynamo of a company based in Framingham , Mass. , in a deal that will complete the transformation of Compaq into a global provider of everything from handheld computers to the monster machines that power corporate networks and the Internet . The buyout creates a behemoth with $37 billion in revenues that trails only the $78 billion IBM . " In the early ' 80s , if we had thought of one day displacing IBM in PCs and rivaling it in size overall , we would have made good candidates for the loony bin , " says Compaq chairman Ben Rosen . <P> Compaq ( 1997 revenues : $24.6 billion ) survived a near collapse a few years back to become the world 's leading PC provider . Last year the company , based in Houston , brought home computing to the masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovator in the 1970s and ' 80s and a legendary disaster in the ' 90s ( it flat missed the PC revolution ) had few options . Now Compaq can couple its manufacturing and marketing savvy with Digital 's high-end technology and global sales and service reach . Compaq will rely less on hardware , an advantage in an industry whose prices continue to erode . " This gets Compaq out of being a box supplier and puts it in the position of delivering full-service solutions to huge corporations , " says Stuart Woodring , a vice president for Forrester Research in Cambridge , Mass . <P> The deal brings sweet redemption to Digital 's shareholders . Burdened by losses of more than $5 billion this decade , the company 's stock slumped from nearly $200 a share in 1987 to $45 when Compaq jumped in with its $57.40-a-share offer . Compaq 's stock , which more than doubled in the past year , closed at $30 last week . <P> It looks like a good bet that Compaq CEO Eckhard Pfeiffer will reach his audacious goal of $50 billion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German-born Pfeiffer replaced ousted co-founder Rod Canion in 1991 , a year in which price wars and a slumping economy cut Compaq 's sales 10% , to $3.2 billion . Pfeiffer applied American management techniques , slashing payrolls and streamlining manufacturing . He used the savings to launch lines of lower-priced PCs . In ' 96 he led the company into high-margin , big-iron computing , buying Tandem Computer for $3 billion . Tandem 's machines process everything from stock trades to credit-card transactions . <P> Digital completes a strategic triangle . It produces such high-margin items as the servers that link thousands of PCs on the Net , but its support staff serves such blue-chip customers as Citicorp and Lockheed Martin . Digital will smooth Compaq 's path into the corporate computing world coveted by Pfeiffer . " Services open the door for hardware , " says Digital chairman Robert Palmer . <P> Compaq wasted little time flexing its muscle . Shortly after announcing the Digital deal , Compaq elbowed IBM aside to become the exclusive PC supplier to Radio Shack 's chain of 6,800 electronics stores .
