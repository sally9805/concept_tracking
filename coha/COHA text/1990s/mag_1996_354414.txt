IF JESUS CHRIST CAME BACK TODAY , would he be an alternative rocker ? In his day he was something of a counterculturist , hanging out with lepers , driving Pharisees and Roman governors to distraction , suffering little children to come unto him no matter what the stuffy old adults thought . So , were he around today , would he be ministering to disaffected youth in a mosh pit ? Would his Sermon on the Mount be turned into a Street Corner Rap ? Would MTV put The Lord 's Prayer video in the Buzz Bin ? <P> As of this writing , Jesus is n't around  --  not in the flesh , anyway  --  so it has been left to others to do the hard work of updating his message and making it ' 90s friendly . For a growing number of Christian musicians , this means using rock and rap as vehicles to carry religious messages to young audiences . Of course , this is n't a new strategy , since musicians have been combining popular music and religious themes for decades . Gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered too earthy to perform in church ; the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar came out way back in 1970 ; and Christian diva Amy Grant has been racking up Grammys and gold records for years with her lite-FM pop . But younger Christian performers are now borrowing from a wider , more modern array of musical styles  --  such as alternative rock and gangsta rap  --  in an effort to create music that can appeal to a generation raised on Nirvana and Dr. Dre . <P> And it 's working . Fewer than 200 radio stations around the country played Christian pop 10 years ago ; now there are more than 500 . According to some estimates , the sale of Christian pop concert tickets and record sales generated between $750 million and $900 million in revenues last year . Fans are young and old ; many are religious , but some just like the music . " There 's more money and better distribution than there was two or three years ago , " says Billy Ray Hearn , chairman and CEO of EMI Christian Music Group . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and K Marts . " <P> The Christian pop industry is also starting to produce some genuine stars  --  performers who are making an impact not just in religious-music circles but in the secular world as well . In part this is due to the fact that last year Billboard magazine 's SoundScan system , which measures album sales nationwide , started to take into account purchases at Christian bookstores  --  where 85% of Christian pop albums are sold . As a result , pop crooners such as Steven Curtis Chapman and Michael W. Smith , both veteran performers in the world of Christian music , saw albums they released in ' 95 climb higher on the charts than any of their previous releases ( Chapman 's The Music of Christmas peaked at No. 61 , Smith 's I 'll Lead You Home hit No. 16 ) . Newer acts , such as religious rappers turned alternative rockers DC Talk and the hip-hop-influenced gospel group Kirk Franklin and the Family , have also performed strongly on the newly configured charts  --  and that success has sparked interest in the music industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gospel Music Association : " No matter how good you think the music is , when it can be validated by an objective system like SoundScan , it gets a lot of people 's attention .
