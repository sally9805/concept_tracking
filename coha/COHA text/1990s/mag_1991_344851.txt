Youngsters up to 12 balance on a rope walk or on a webbed " bean field , " a bouncy surface with punching bags that hang above it within a child 's grasp . A nearby concession offers turkey dogs , pizza , and carrot and celery sticks . <P> These new playgrounds are not meant to be day-care facilities ; parents are expected to stay and play with their kids rather than drop them off .

If there is a problem , Mom and Dad are paged by beeper . <P> The most fun of all , though , is getting to do what parents used to do in the days before two-career families and two-hour commutes : play with their kids . That , at least , is old-fashioned , even at per-hour rates .
