VARSITY TEAMS : 20 INTRAMURAL SPORTS : 29 FAMOUS ALUMNI : EARL CAMPBELL , ROGER CLEMENS , TOM KITE EXTRA CREDIT FOR : BEVO , THE TAKE-NO-BULL LONGHORNS MASCOT // The parking spaces outside the Texas Recreational Sports Center are virtually all filled , which is not unusual , except that it 's 11 o'clock on a Friday night , an hour when most students normally would have surrendered to the pleasures of Austin 's Sixth Street bars . But on this evening in late January , Texas is in the grips of its annual Spirit of Sport All-Nighter , a 12-hour-plus sportsfest  --  with a slightly exaggerated name  --  in which 5,000 students are taking part , some until after midnight . // Senior Logan Weems avoided the parking-spot drought : He arrived early in the afternoon to sign up for the slam-dunk contest and the indoor soccer tournament , just two of the fest 's 34 activities , which also include basketball , racquetball and volleyball tournaments . " There 's always so much going on around this campus , " says Weems after a lead-footed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find what 's good for you . " // Students at Texas do plenty of searching . In the days surrounding the sportsfest , they can be found taking in competitions involving nationally ranked Longhorns teams in six sports ( baseball , men 's tennis , men 's and women 's basketball , and men 's and women 's swimming ) , all within a half mile of one another . The downside of this activity is evident in the baggy eyes and grade point average of sophomore Jeff McDonald , a sportswriter for the school paper , The Daily Texan , and in the disappointed voice of avid swim fan Indira Allick , a senior . " I like waking up at 9 a.m. and working on stories until 2 a.m. , " McDonald says at the paper 's underground headquarters , from which have emerged a number of top sportswriters . Many made their mark as undergrads covering some of the Longhorns teams that have won 35 NCAA titles , including 15 in swimming and diving , four in baseball and three in football . " The 2.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the real-world sports journalism experience that counts . " // " There is always so much going on that it 's hard to grasp it all , " says Allick , who is in the swim center watching the Longhorns compete against Arizona and Florida . She lifts her eyes from the future Olympians in the pool and scans the sparse crowd . " It 's just hard to get people here on a nice day when there 's so much else happening , " she says . // Some four hundred yards away , junior Ray Dennes is sitting chin-in-hand on a bench at Clark Field , staring glumly at the games under way on the four outdoor basketball courts . He looks longingly at court 1 , but his chances of playing there are as slim as those of a blizzard 's breaking out on this clear , 82 afternoon . Court 1 is for the best players on campus and around Austin . Scouts from colleges across the country sometimes hang out by the green fence , looking for talent . The starting guards on this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clack , grew up playing at Clark . // " The first court is NBA-level , the second NCAA , and it goes down from there , " Vazquez says , with some overstatement . " I went out there once and native Austinite and former Michigan Fab Five player Ray Jackson was there , and he had brought former teammates Jalen Rose and Jimmy King . " So where do casual players like Dennes fit in ? " Most of the students get sent down to the other three courts , " Vazquez explains . " They 'll rarely get called to run the first court . " // The previous night at the rec center , Weems did n't mind waiting for his chance to play in the indoor soccer tournament . His team had a first-round bye , so he was content to watch two other five-man sides duel on one of the gym 's three basketball courts . " We might be here until 1 a.m. , but it does n't matter , " he said . " When else do you get to play indoor soccer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , gave a nearby teammate a wink and confessed , " It 's not like we 're not going to go out partying afterward.
