Conversion to 4wd , Quigley van own trails - pretty much anywhere . Photograph // Four-wheel drive comes , traditionally , in one of these flavors : 4x4 pickups , Jeeps and the legions of Jeep pretenders-the ohso-fashionable sport utility vehicles . And the SUV market in particular has gone to large , economysize vehicles within the last year or two . But not large enough for some . Oh sure , Suburbans and Expeditions are big , but sometimes you just need something big enough to take 10 or so friends , or a lot of camping gear , far from the nearest road . Ever drive a full-size 11-passenger 2wd van on a twotrack road into the woods ? Or even on a snowy uphill slope ? With most of the weight up front , there 's precious little traction . Pulling a bass boat clear of the water on an unpaved or algae-covered boat ramp can be downright impossible . Unfortunately , the Big Three manufacturers who make full-size vans just do n't offer the option of four-wheel drive . Which is why Quigley Motor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It converts 4x2 Chevy , GMC and Ford vans to 4x4 with full off-road capability . Sorry , no Dodges for now . The conversions are done using off-the-shelf transfer cases from Borg Warner and modified Dana 44 and 60 solid front axles . Fourwheel-drive van conversions are n't unique to Quigley . But not everyone does them right or well . The difference with the Quigley conversion is the company 's 10-plus years of experience and a considerable attention to detail . The first thing you notice about a Quigley fourdive conversion is the height . It 's a long way up into the driver 's seat . The ride height is raised 4 in. in front and 3 in. in the rear . This does n't really increase the measured ground clearance , which is measured from the bottom of the differential to the pavement , but it does give a lot more room over rough ground and really makes a difference clearing steep ramps and rocks with the front and rear overhang . Around town , or on the freeway , it is no different from driving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a really big first step up into the cab ( we suggest ordering the running boards ) , and unless you 're a bus or big rig driver , you 'll find it odd looking down into the cabs of normal vans and pickups . Surprisingly , there 's no sensation of tippiness or excess lean . The ride quality is indistinguishable from a normal van 's . Despite the added height of the van , the center of gravity is barely raised , since the added components are mounted so low . As for off-road , while the traction is superb , rock-crawling will never be any full-size van 's long suit . The turning circle is far too long to snake in between the trees and the lonz wheelbase will leave it high-centered over obstacies a jeep Wrangler 's shorter chassis would never touch . Oh , and the van 's just too tall to get under some overhanging branches . Nuts And Bolts Ford conversions use the original coil springs , and custom-made control arms and a Panhard rod to carry the front axle . GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a very robust - looking leaf-spring setup . Both conversions are remarkably supple and squeak- and rattlefree . The frame rails themdelves are reinforced , beam , mounted ahead of he axle , ties the front frame corns together for extra rigidity . One compromise is the necessity of shortening the fuel tank on some conversions to make room for the transfer case , reducing tank capacity from 22 gal . to 19 . Considerable computer simulation was done by Quigley to see if the tank would maintain its integrity in a worstcase crash scenario . This virtual crash testin was then followed bv an actual crash test b an NHTSA-approved engineering firm , validatputer simulation . If you order your van with antilock braking , Quigley will convert the new front axle to ABS capability by machining its own tone rings and modifying original equipment ABS sensors to fit . Everything then hooks up to the vanmaker 's ABS . Trust us , that 's no small feat . The original brake discs and calipers are retained . Photograph Quigley manufactures and modifies many of the conversion components in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4wd componendts are all mounted low , the center of gravity of the conversion is raised only an inch or so . All of Quigley 's engineering is under the floor pan . Besides adding necessary drivetrain pieces , the company modifies the suspension and frame . // The only exterior signs of the 4x4 system , aside from the extra ride height and badges , are the automatically locking front hubs . You can specify manual hubs if you prefer . In the interior , the only differences are the extra gearshift lever between the seats for the transfer case and a light on the dash panel to indicate when the system is actually in 4wd . Sign Here Okay , now that you know all about these 4wd vans , you want one . How do you go about acquiring a Quigley ? Go to your local Chevy , GMC or Ford dealer and spec out your van of choice , including almost any engine and interior . Then add the Quigley conversion to the order . Your van will be built and shipped directly to Quigley , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealer . You then collect your van from the dealer with a full factory warranty , and Quigley 's warranty on the modified components . The conversion adds $8500 to the price of the van you order . <p>
