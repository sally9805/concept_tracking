CAMP AND TELL <P> Most kids go to camp to learn how to make lanyards and swim . But Chase Culeman-Beckman claims he got an education with more far-reaching implications . Now 19 , Culeman-Beckman says in 1988 he went to day camp with Jacob Bernstein , son of former Washington Post reporter Carl Bernstein , and Jacob told him that W. MARK FELT , associate director of the FBI during Watergate , was the shadowy source known as Deep Throat . Culeman-Beckman researched the theory for a high school history class and this summer copyrighted an essay supporting it . But Carl Bernstein says he never told Jacob or his mother , screenwriter Nora Ephron , the identity of his source . Jacob was " repeating his mother 's guesswork , " Bernstein told the New York Post . Ephron concurs : " Carl never told me who Deep Throat was ... But I always suspected it was Mark Felt . " Felt , now 86 , dismisses the theory . " I would have been more effective , " he told the Hartford Courant last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the dirty secret Bride 's Magazine never tells you : Do n't forget to frisk the guests on the way out .

You can keep the velvet napkin rings . " <P> BY ANY NAME , SHE 'S STILL SCARY <P> The World Wrestling Federation stripped her of her moniker ; the clothes , she took off herself . Last week Rena Mero , the wrestler who can no longer be called SABLE , settled her $110 million lawsuit against the WWF .

Though neither party will divulge the financial details , Mero has agreed to relinquish rights to the name Sable and for the next three years stay out of the ring , where she seems to have few issues with exposure . This week Mero appears on the cover of Playboy , the only woman to do so twice in one year . She is also said to be embarking on a project with Gene Simmons of Kiss and may play female warrior Red Sonja in a television series . That hellcat reputation is hard to shake . <P> FEUD OF THE WEEK <P> NAME : Alan Keyes OCCUPATION : Would-be George W. Bush BEST PUNCH : After Leno joked about all G.O.P. presidential candidates being white , Keyes spokeswoman Becky Fenger asked for a correction . She says Leno grew angry , acting like a " nut cake " and a " rage-aholic .
