<p> During October , breast cancer awareness month , the Atlanta newspapers and local TV stations did an excellent job encouraging women to take proper steps to prevent the disease . <p> Then , two weeks later , the newspaper printed a front-page article , " Menopause , not age , called key factor for mammogram . " <p> Last January , I buried my sister after a 2 1/2-year battle with breast cancer . She was 40 years old . Three of my close friends are still battling breast cancer . All contacted this disease before age 45 . <p> I have recently become active with the Breast Cancer Coalition and can assure the newspaper these are not isolated cases . Many women must face this disease in their 30s or 40s . <p> We have been told by the American Cancer Society that mammograms can detect tumors two years before they are detected by self-exam . <p> The earlier the detection , the better the chance of survival . We are also fighting to get all mammography machines certified nationwide - two- thirds are not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurate , " as the article states , rather than the age of the women ? <p> The article told women in their 30s and 40s suffering from this dreadful disease that it is " a waste of time and scarce resources " to give mammograms to pre-menopausal women . <p> My sister wished she had her baseline mammogram at age 35 . She might be alive today . She and my friends had no history of breast cancer . <p> My letter can not begin to counteract the damage of this article printed on the front page . <p> Let 's hope that those trying to weigh the time and cost of a mammogram will not make the wrong decision . <p> What an exciting time we live in . Who would have thought we would see the day when the Arabs and Israelis would be sitting at the same table - no matter what the outcome . Events are changing the world so fast that even educated adults are hard-pressed to keep up with all the new countries . <p> High school and even college students have trouble identifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are we doing to educate our young people about the whole world ? <p> In Europe , children are exposed to at least two languages . Most are taught at least English , as well as their own language . We do n't know that much about our own next-door neighbors in Mexico , and people here think the Canadians are pretty much like ourselves . <p> The opportunity to do business internationally is definitely out there , but emerging nations will be able to choose from many suppliers , and we 'd better measure up . It will help the next generation of wheeler- dealers to know basic geography . <p> We could use the observance of National Geography Week to promote better understanding and knowledge of our friends and neighbors in this small , wonderful world . <p> The Nov. 11 editorial , " Why sell state recreation sites ? , " provides a balanced position in support of Georgia 's park system . <p> Approximately six years ago , the Clay County Economic Development Council launched a program to develop tourism utilizing the resource of Lake Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we were unsuccessful in obtaining the required investment from the private sector . <p> Fortunately we gained the support of the Georgia Legislature , resulting in the funding of a 30-room lodge , a marina and a restaurant . The resort includes conference rooms and tennis courts . The park was opened in the spring of 1989 . <p> The major objective of establishing a resort park on Lake Walter F. George beyond the obvious recreation benefits was economic growth , creation of new jobs and increased tax revenue for Georgia . We are off to a good start . <p> Dr. Jeff Humphreys , director of economic forecasting for the University of Georgia , reports figures for taxable sales for Clay County increased 19.5 percent in 1991 over 1990 . This occurred when the area experienced disastrous results in agriculture , our leading industry by far . <p> Based on our experience , it is apparent that continued development of this park to its full potential will increase the tax base and economic development for southwest Georgia . <p> So Tom Teepen believes Magic Johnson 's retirement from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? OK , from now on let 's call AIDS the Magic Johnson disease . <p> How dare Mr. Teepen equate the termination of a sports career due to promiscuous sexual activity with that of an authentic hero who contracted a fatal disease through no fault of his own . <p> This attempt to pre-empt adverse criticism by labeling objections to the canonization of Johnson as just more twitting from fuddy-duddies who just do n't want the boys and girls to enjoy a little fun and games wo n't wash . <p> What 's so courageous about Johnson 's calling a press conference and publicly announcing that he had " attained " HIV ? What were the alternatives ? He had no choice but to quit basketball . <p> There was no way he could have prevented the diagnosis of his illness from leaking . If he had n't explained it , the rumors would have begun and spread that he was a homosexual or at best bisexual . Other rumors would have been that he got the virus from the use of drugs . He took the only reasonable way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known he would be hailed as a hero . <p> . . . I appreciate The Atlanta Constitution 's decision not to stoop to the level of tabloid journalism by printing the politics of Garry Trudeau . <p> The same U.S. Constitution that guarantees us freedom of the press also guarantees us the pursuit of happiness . So , if stealing makes me happy , does that give me a constitutional right to steal ? No , nor does the U.S. Constitution guarantee that the press provide a forum for irresponsible journalism such as character-assassination attempts based on documented false information . <p> The newspaper 's editors did the right thing . If editors stop researching stories and testing accusations , we are indeed not far from the state dictating what is acceptable news material . <p> I expect responsible newspapers to print the unbiased facts and allow us to interpret them as we see fit . If they start to mix fact with slander , how long will it be before we ca n't separate fact from fantasy ? <p> The newspaper 's decision not to publish the Doonesbury strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship . <p> Freedom of the press means that publishers are free to publish or not publish as they see fit . If some agency sought to prevent publication of Doonesbury , that would be an attempt at censorship . How did so many readers get the false notion that the newspaper is required to publish something of which it does n't approve ? <p> The best reason for not publishing Doonesbury , ever , is that its creator is a blatantly left-wing propagandist for the Democratic Party and always has been . <p> After reviewing the mix of letters recently concerning the Doonesbury/Dan Quayle flap , I have come to the following conclusions about the readership : <p> 1 ) For many , The Constitution is undoubtedly their backup source of information after the grocery store tabloids. 2 ) They consider Geraldo a serious TV journalist . <p> Ya 'll did the right thing . There is a difference between censorship and printing a proven untruth even in the funnies.
