From the outside , it seemed like 26-year-old New Yorker Laurie Prince had the perfect life-a great husband , great friends , great future . But something terrible was growing inside her that threatened to destroy it all . Photograph Laurie post-procedure ( a nerve moved in surgery left her eye temporarily shut ) . // * Something was definitely wrong with me . I was constantly plagued by an overwhelming sense of fatigue . When I first started dating my husband , David ( a 28year-old stock broker ) , six years ago , he was then a nightclub owner and we used to go out until the small hours of the morning . Now , with our wedding approaching , I could n't even stay awake past 9:00 P.M. I went to my doctor to find out why l was always so exhausted , but he merely replied that he was tired all the time too . David and I were married in June of 1996 , and our honeymoon should have been the happiest time in my life . Instead it was a nightmare.We went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . David was so excited to show me the sights , but all I could think about was going back to the hotel so I could sleep . And that was n't all . After we returned home , I began gaining a lot of weight ( 20 ponds in six months alone ! ) . For 25 years , I had been able to eat anything and not gain a pound . Now , even though I worked out at the gym six days a week and ate nothing but steamed vegetables for breakfast , lunch , and dinner , I could n't stop gaining weight , and I was growing more and more depressed almost it . A lot of people thought I was bingeing on the sly . Even David thought I was ar closet earter . For the last five years actually , I had noticed some other strange , inexplicable symptoms , and when we got back from our honeymoon , they started getting even worse : I was becoming unbelievably clumsy . I 'd accidentally bump into walls , knock things off tables , drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drooled when I ate . And even though I was working out every day the right side of my body seemed to be weakening . When I stopped menstrating in April of 1996 , I assumed that a gynecological problem had been behind everything . I went to see three different OB/GYNs , but still , no one had any answers : One told me that it was normal for a young woman my age to have an irregular period ; another said it was the result of working out too much ; the third told me not to be so hysterical . Meanwhile , my symptoms dragged on and continued to worsen for the next year . David had been concerned about the changes in me , and when several friends asked hm why I was so depressed and tired all the time , he insisted that we go together to our family doctor , New York University internist Stuart Lewis , and give him my entire laundry list of symptoms . Dr. Lewis suggested an MRI ( magnetic resonance imaging ) to rule out a problem with my pituitary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy level ) . My mother joined me that March 5,1998 . It was a day that would change the rest of my life . It was the day I was diagnosed with a brain tumor . Preparing for the Worst When Dr. Lewis told me the MRI showed a brain tumor , my first reaction was that there had been some kind of l mistake . I felt totally and completely disassociated from my body , like I was watching an episode of some TV program and this nightmare was happening to someone else-not me . Then , reality slowly sank in-I had a tumor the size of aI tennis hall growing inside the base of my skull . Even as the doctor reassured my mother and me that this was n't necessarily a death sentence , I kept thinking , I 'm going to die . But as terrified as I was , part of me felt strangely relieved-at least now there was an explanation for everything that had been going on . Photograph " Our honeymoon should have been a dream , but a tumor made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the doctor 's office , I immediately called David and my father and told them to meet my mom and me at home . When we arrived David was already on the phone with our doctor , crying . He hung up , walked over to me without saying a word , and held me like he was never going to let me go . I 'm sure my dad was in shock , hut he was calm and strong for my mother and me . That evening , after giving the rest of my friends and family the news we started to search for a specialist who could save me . A family friend gave us the name of a neurosurgeon at New York City 's Mount Sinai Hospital , whom she described as a piece of heaven on earth " - Chandranath Sen. We Called him and he agreed to see us the following morning . Doctors Diagnosis I 'll never forget my first meeting with Dr. Sen After reviewing the MRI films of my brain , Dr. Sen estimated that my tumor had been growing for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chordoma  --  an extremely rare kind of tumor ( comprising fewer than one percent of all brain tumors ) which originates in cells at the base of the skull and spine . Chordomas , he said , are usually benign but invasive , meaning their growth interferes with the healthy functioning of all surrounding glands and nerves . No one knovs what triggers them ; they seem to occur at random But they did know that it would kill me if it was n't operated on and removed . Having taken out a plastic model of the human brain , Dr. Sen pointed to where my tumor was located-at the base of my skull-and explained that it was a very risky place on which to operate . In order to reach the tumor , my head would have to be cut open and the nerves that control my sense of smell would be damaged . I 'd never be able to smell again . I would need one , possibly two , lifethreatening operations , Dr. Sen said , and he was one of only five neurosurgeons in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next week , I visited with all the other doctors that I had been referred to , but Dr. Sen was the only one who thought he could remove the entire tumor . My family and I believed in his aggressive treatment , and he made me feel safe . Even though the idea of brain surgery scared me beyond belief , I wanted to have this ordeal over with as soon as possible . I 'd rather risk death than live like this any longer-I was that miserable . My surgery was scheduled for four and a half weeks later , on April 9 . Waiting ... and Worrying The anticipation was agonizing . But at least I did n't have to go through it alone . I was overwhelmed-tons of people gathered in my apartment day and night so that I would n't have to be by myself for even a minute . My home was overflowing with more flowers than the local florist . My shelves were filled with stuffed animals . And my mailbox was constantly crammed full of get-well cards and letters . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting without the support of all my friends and relatives . One afternoon , my mother , several dear friends , and I all sat around my apartment and came up with adjectives to vividly describe the smells that I love , including perfumes , powders , and creams . Later , one friend used those words to write poems about the scents in a beautifully illustrated journal so that I would be able to have them with me forever . It was a little strange knowing that I was prbably smelling some of these things for the last time , but I was n't really upset ; it seemed like a small price to pay to have my life back . On April 8 , the day before the surgery I checked into Moun Sinai . My parents shared a tiny cot in my room every night I was there . My older sister , Liz , came every moring and night to take care of me and keep me company so that I would not lose my mind staring at the hospital walls . And David took some time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . The night before the surgery I repeated the same mantra over and over again until I fell asleep : Please let Dr. Sen remove my entire tumor , please let there be no complications , please let me need only one surgery . And please , please do n't let me die . ' More than anything , I was scared I would n't have the chance to grow old and have a family with David . When morning arrived and a hospital attendant came to wheel me off to surgery , I tried my best to remain calm . But when we reached the doors leading to the operating room and the anesthesiologist began giving me the drugs to knock me out , I started to shake uncontrollably . I was so terrified that I would die and never see my husband , mother , father , and sister again . A moment later , the drugs took effect , and the next thing I knew , the surgery was over and I was waking up in the intensive care unit . Back to My Old Self The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous headache , but I felt better and stronger than I had in years . As impossible as it sounds , only two days after the surgery , I had already lost 20 pounds - most of it water weight-and the clumsiness , drooling , and slurring stopped . To me , this was the greatest news of all , because it proved to everyone who had dismissed my symptoms that this fat , sluggish , clumsy person was n't me . It was as though something inside me had been unclogged , as though there had been something holding me back from functioning properly and that blockage had flinally been cleared away . Three days later , as I was being wheeled down the hall for a test , Dr. Sen took my hand in his and told me gently that I needed to have a second surgery-that he had only been able to remove 80 percent of the tumor and that there was still a shell of it left on my skull that needed to be removed so it would n't grow back . I was devastated . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any physical agony I had ever endured . I did n't think I could handle going through it all again . Dr. Sen must have seen how scared I was , because his usually soft-spoken voice suddenly became very firm . He explained to me that the only way I could beat this would be to remain positive . Those words changed everything for me . Suddenly , I was n't scared anymore . Emergency I returned home from the hospital on April 16 , a week after the surgery . The next day , I got some good news from Dr. Sen : A biopsy had confirmed that the tumor was a chordoma and was benign . My next surgery was scheduled for three and a half weeks later , and again , the torturous waiting began . This time , though , the wait was even worse : Dr. Sen had warned me to watch for blood or spinal fluid leaking from my nose-it could signal that a tiny hole had been created in the base of my skull during surgery , which would put me at great risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweet scent-iment : Friends made Laurie a book describing her favorite smells . // Four days after I came home , my nose began to bleed . As soon as I felt the blood , I was panic-stricken . My mother rushed me to the emergency room at Mount Sinai , where the doctors proceded to put a drain in my spine to test for the infection . The pain from that procedure was beyond excruciating , and the headache that followed was even worse . The test result indicated that there was a hole , but luckily , I had not yet contracted meningitis . The doctors prescribed antibiotics to prevent an infection from starting , and my next surgery was scheduled for two days later . For better or worse , the wait was over . The second brain surgery took 14 hours , because removing the calcified shell of the tumor was such a delicate procedure . I woke up right after the surgery in the ICU , where Dr. Sen told me that this time , he believed he had removed the entire tumor . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , resulting in double vision in my right eye that he said would last up to six months . I would have to wear an eye patch until it corrected itself and returned to normal . But that did n't matter to me-the operation had been a success . And one week later , an MRI confirmed it . The tumor was totally gone . When Dr Sen gave me the good news , it almost did n't feel real . I just could n't believe that the tumor was really all out and that the horrible nightmare was finally all over . A Second Chance In a strange way , I feel very blessed for what I went through . I realize , in a way that most people will never begin to fully understand , how precious life is . I am also extremely fortunate to have had someone like Dr. Sen come into my life . Not only is he a skilled neurosurgeon , he 's also the most humble and kind man I 've ever met . I know that I would n't be alive today if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instilling me with such 511C11 El positive attitude . Now , six months after that final surgery , I 'm almost fully recovered . It 's been along and difficult ordeal , but for the first time in many years , I feel healthy again . My eyesight and weight are rapidly returning to normal , I no longer slur my words or tip over my own feet , and my energy level is better than ever . I barely notice my loss of smell-in fact , since I 'm paper training my brand new puppy , it 's probably a blessing in disguise ! Most of all , I just feel tremendously lucky to have been given a second chance at life . Photograph " It 's been a difficult ordeal , but for the first time in years , I feel healthy again .
