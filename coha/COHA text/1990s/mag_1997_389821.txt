Saturday morning , as soon as I woke up , I knew it was going to be a bad day . This was the day I had to take care of my little brother , Lester . There 's nothing wrong with Lester , if you like tornadoes , mad tigers , and stinging bumblebees . My mom said , " David , remember that Lester is your brother . You 're supposed to love him even if he is difficult . Besides , I need your help . " She 's right . She needs help with Lester . She needs my help , Dad 's help , the police department 's help , and all the help she can possibly get . Lester really puzzles Dad , especially when he uses the knobs off the TV for building blocks , or when he makes a gocart out of our vacuum cleaner . " I do n't know how Lester got this way , " Dad said , " but he 's only four , so maybe he 'll outgrow this stage . " Dad and Mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job of looking after Lester . I can handle him at home because our house is " Lesterproofed . " But Saturday , my scout leader , Mr. Fontenot , was taking four of us to the Oak Park Nursing Home to put on a play for the old people there . I was in a hurry , but I had to stop and clean up Lester 's spilled milk , wipe his toothpaste drawing off the bathroom mirror , and rescue his cat , Hannabel , from his avenger robot . Before we left , I told Lester , " Empty your pockets . " He pulled out a frog , a safety pin , and half an apple . " All of it , " I snapped , waiting for the rubber bands . Lester uses people for rubber band target practice . So out came the rubber bands , a click-clacker , some chewed bubble gum , and a slingshot . Just then Mr. Fontenot honked the horn . " Get your coat and come on , " I said , running out ahead of Lester . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and John . When they saw Lester , they all let out one big groan ! At the nursing home there were a lot of people sitting around , just staring . They looked sad . Finally a couple of people smiled , mostly at Lester . I set him down near a stern-looking man and said , " Take off your coat . " Lester shook his head , keeping his hands in his coat pockets . He looked suspicious . " What are you hiding in your coat ? " I whispered . Just then Mr. Fontenot called me , and I had to go to the dressing room without finding out . Our play was called Dog 's Holiday , and I played a Saint Bernard dog . Mom had made a costume for me , but the ears kept slipping over my eyes , so I could n't see well . As the play began , I crawled across the stage . Right away , the dog ears slipped down over my eyes and I smacked right into Robert ! He was singing , " Oh where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fell on top of Steven and John ! They all seemed to be rolling over something that was screeching , but I could n't see what . The audience went wild . They all laughed even though it was n't supposed to be funny ! They laughed so hard the whole room shook. ! Robert tried singing again . And then somebody stepped on my Saint Bernard tail . RIP ! TEAR ! The whole back end of my costume tore off ! And something alive landed on the back of my neck ! It screeched ! I screeched ! Steven and John and I and this creature were tumbling all over one another . Ripping off my dog mask , I stared right at Hannabel , Lester 's cat ! His fur was standing up . He was hissing . He recognized me and he ran off . We all ran . The play ended suddenly . But the clapping and laughing went on and on . I plotted Lester 's murder as I went into the dressing room to change . Then Mr. Fontenot walked in , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally he said , " You were all great ! They loved it ! They have n't had this much fun in years . And David , I 'm glad you brought Lester and his cat . Pets and little kids are good therapy for older people ! " When we walked back into the other room , the old people grabbed us and hugged us . They gave us lemonade and oatmeal cookies . Lester and one of the grandpas whizzed by in an electric wheelchair , but I ignored him . Next day , the front page of our newspaper carried a story about our scout troop 's project . And guess who was in the picture ? Lester , Hannabel , and me . I guess Dad 's right . Maybe Lester will eventually outgrow this stage . I hope so . But life sure wo n't be as exciting when he does . <p>
