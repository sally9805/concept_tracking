txt EVERY CREEPING THING He was an agreeable fellow , a member of the " Banana Leisure " jogging club . Coyne leaned down from her horse to give him his final instructions : " You see that fence there ? Go through it and go straight on . Get on now . " " O.K. , right-o , " the runner replied . He trotted off , leaving a sweaty T-shirt tied to a stake in the middle of the starting area , as the scent article for the hounds . " He 's got no smell , " Coyne muttered dismally , when he was out of earshot . The whipper-in had the pack of hounds gathered together at a safe distance , and now Coyne went up to greet them . " Oh , we 've got the girlie , whirlie , pearlies ! " she exulted . " The big fat ladies and the little thin ladies ! " The hounds danced around her worshipfully . " Bloodhounds hunt , " Coyne called down to me , " because they like you . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their fun , to play . They 'll tell you to bugger off if you use the whip on them . Whereas the foxhound is tough as old boots . " As we waited for the runner to make the most of his head start , the chairman and founder of the hunt , a florid , overweight fellow named Major William Stringer , recollected his first efforts with bloodhound hunting as a British Army officer stationed in West Germany in the 1960s . " We used soldiers as runners , " he said . " Volunteers . With a slight bit of pressure . " He recalled in particular a Private Smith who volunteered on a day when a general from the German army joined the field . The general , said Stringer , " thought it was great hunting a human , absolutely perfect . " The unfortunate Private Smith apparently felt otherwise . But he set off , and after a reasonable interval , the hounds went after him , with the field of hunters behind . As the thunderous bellowing of the pack drew closer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " Stringer said , " I suddenly noticed that the fences were getting higher , we were going over wires and all , and I thought , Where is this man Smith going ? ' And then I thought 60 Good Scents we were on to deer . Some of the horses were falling out , we were going so fast . I started looking for gaps and gates to go through . The general said , Come on , Bill , go on , give us a lead , ' and I was thinking , My God , when I catch this bloody man Smith I 'll give him hell . ' Finally , I came up and there he was , hiding behind a tree . I was just about to put him in the brig , when the general came up and said , Nobody in the world can hunt as well as we did today . ' So of course I said , Well done , Smith . ' " As Major Stringer finished his story , Ruth Coyne announced that time was up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the starting point , and they were off in an instant , with hardly an olfactory glance at the scent article , their baying inaudible above the roar of the motorway . " Going like the clappers , " Coyne declared with satisfaction , and then she galloped off , with her field of twenty riders in pursuit . Major Stringer , who no longer rides , and various other friends and family followed the hunt by car , sometimes circling ahead of the pack . The frantic hounds ran directly where the runner had gone , or on a parallel course a few feet away where the wind had caused his scent trail to drift . Delilah and the fat old ladies scrambled under blackthorn hedges , burst through loose stone walls , leaped over obstacles with their loose flesh dancing around them like schoolgirls ' skirts . As the scent got warmer , they raced faster and bellowed more wildly . Followers of the hunt describe this as " beautiful music . " But one of the runners told me it was an " eerie , a most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk among the hunt followers turned to the Labour Party 's plans to outlaw foxhunting . According to the newspapers , two hundred protesters had showed up a few nights before at a hunt ball in Manchester , chanting " Rich bastards ! " and spitting on women as they arrived in their evening gowns . Almost everyone in the Windsor Forest Hunt started out in foxhunting , and many still participate , so they tended , as a matter of form , to denounce animal rights protesters . // One of them worried that traditionalists might " think we 're cashing in as a soft alternative to foxhunting . " Still , everyone was aware that squeamishness and unrest about blood sports are increasing , and no one asked indiscreet questions about anyone else 's lily-livered sympathies . Queen Elizabeth herself decided years ago to abstain from the foxhunt . But hunting with bloodhounds has earned her approval . On one occasion , the Windsor Forest Hunt met by invitation in the royal park surrounding Windsor Castle and she joined several members of the royal family in the pursuit ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabloid press ) . Between the second and third run of the day , the hounds and riders were taking a rest in a field when we suddenly heard the snap-crackle-pop of machine gun fire . It developed that amateur war games were taking place in a woods nearby . Candy-canestriped plastic police tape defined the battle area , where men and women dressed in gas masks and camouflage darted about , enjoying the outdoors and shooting one another . A judge in a neon green jumpsuit presided . The members of the bloodhound hunt surveyed this extraordinary scene in wonder . Just then , a team of hunt saboteurs showed up at the end of the field to block the gate with their bodies in defense of animal rights . One of the more diplomatic members of the hunt gently explained that this pack consisted of bloodhounds ; it was n't actually hunting foxes , but . . . well ... human beings . The hunt saboteurs contemplated this news , and after a moment , as if to say , " Well , that 's alright , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hunt proceeded to chase its final victim of the day . The truth of course is that the bloodhounds did not kill anything that day or any other . The English people , while still known to dote on dogs , take a strong line against tearing the local citizenry to pieces . Indeed , the hunters would have a hard time getting their hounds to bite . Whatever fierceness bloodhounds may once have possessed has been bred out of them . Modern blood-62 Good Scents hounds are unimaginably gentle , affectionate with children , and tolerant even of inquisitive journalists measuring the twentyeight-to thirty-inch span of their ears . Bloodhound fanciers tend nowadays to deny that fierceness was ever a bloodhound trait . When the hounds of the Windsor Forest Hunt caught up with their quarry , they licked him . " When the runner is found , " writes one follower of the hunt , " he is not torn to pieces , but greeted by dozens of wet tongues ! A wonderful sight ! " The hunt ended not in blood but in slobber . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , many bloodhound owners blame Harriet Beecher Stowe . " Uncle Tom 's Cabin gave the bloodhound such a fearsome connotation , " Catherine Brey and Len Reed write in The Complete Bloodhound , " that to this day many people believe he is a savage and dangerous animal . " Another author complains that on hearing the word " bloodhound , " " nine people out of ten conjure up a tearful scene of poor Liza . . . frantically scrambling across the ice floes with a pack of vicious , red-eyed , froth-drooling beasts baying sadistically at her heels . " As it happens , these authors are wrong to malign Stowe . Bloodhounds did , of course , chase Liza in the 1927 movie of Uncle Tom 's Cabin and in innumerable nineteenth-century stage productions . They became such a standby that a humorist exiting one unfortunate staging remarked , " The dogs was good , but they lacked support . " But Stowe 's version of Liza 's crossing does not include any dogs at all , and her book never once mentions bloodhounds. the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its appearnce or its name or Harriet Beecher Stowe , but the whole troubling question of scent , which human beings are ill-equipped to understand . To find out more , I took a trip up to East Greenbush , // New York , to visit with David and Hilda Onderdonk . The Onderdonks were soon reciting how they often travel long distances to help in a search , only to have their hounds ' findings ignored or even ridiculed . In one case of an eighteen-year-old man reported missing , they drove to Bennington , Vermont , and put a hound on a trail that was then eight days old . According to the Onderdonks , the hound picked up the man 's scent on bushes in a residential area and followed the trail into a grocery store and a bank , sniffing high up on storefronts and other buildings . He stopped finally at a bench outside the bus terminal . But the man 's family sent the hound packing , disbelieving him not just because the trail was old and ran through impossibly busy streets , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal had sold the man a ticket . This turned out to be correct . The man later phoned home from California and said that he had never gone into the terminal , but bought his ticket on the bus , for which he waited on the bench outside . This sort of anecdote inevitably elicits the " Come , come " response from scientists . But Hilda Onderdonk put the case for believing the bloodhound this way : " You buy a coonhound to run coons . You buy a beagle to chase rabbits . You buy a bird hound to flush out birds . So why do you find it so hard to believe that bloodhounds can find people ? " Three likely reasons sprang to mind : People do n't want to think that they are smelly . They particularly do n't want to think that they smell different from everybody else . And if indeed they must smell , they do n't want to think that , even after vigorous bathing , they leave an odiferous wake lingering behind them for days at a time , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the garbage can . More to the point , humans can not smell whatever it is about them that the bloodhound smells . And because this scent , this aura , is imperceptible , it also seems implausible . In the human nose , all of the olfactory cells , which do the work of smelling , are located high up in the nostrils in an area less 64 Good Scents than one inch long . In a bloodhound , the drawn-out canine snout accommodates an olfactory membrane that is at least six times as long . But length only begins to suggest what is really an exponential increase in sensitivity . The olfactory membrane in all mammals is spread out across tiny , paper-thin bones rolled up in scrolls , called nasal conchae . " The more scrolls , the larger the surface area for the olfactory membrane , " says Rosemarie Williams , a veterinary neuropathologist at Tufts University , " and that 's factor number one . The second factor is that this membrane contains individual olfactory cells , and each cell has little cilia , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually extrusions of the cell , to increase its surface area . " In humans , the scrolls and cilia translate into about three square centimeters of olfactory membrane . But in a bloodhound 's heavy snout , with the dignified Roman bump accommodating more conchae and thus more smelling power , there may be as much as 150 square centimeters of membrane . Humans also have more highly developed mechanisms for shutting off the sense of smell . In humans and bloodhounds alike , the olfactory cells rapidly get used to a new smell ; they adapt their electrical polarity so that they stop sending out nerve impulses unless the concentration of scent increases . This is part of the reason a smell that is overpowering on entering a room seems almost unnoticeable a minute later . In addition , humans have evolved a powerful mechanism in the brain to suppress the conscious recognition of an odor . " We need to direct our attention toward other things , " says Williams . " This adaptation that we have evolved is one reason that we are a more intelligent animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An animal that needs its nose to locate prey might be fatally handicapped by these same mechanisms . A bloodhound thus does not have a strong suppression mechanism ; it needs to continue consciously following the scent until it finds its quarry . It also needs to avoid olfactory fatigue ? the adaptation in electrical polarity ? so as not // to miss minute particles of scent on the trail . Fortunately , it is possible to revive the olfactory cells with short , sharp bursts of air , alternated with momentary pauses during which the nose is emptied and the olfactory cells rest . Humans ( even wine tasters ) do this ineptly ; they need to use their diaphragms to sniff . Bloodhounds and most other mammals use just the muscles located in their nostrils and pharynx . Bloodhounds are biologically adapted for trailing their prey in one further regard . The process by which the nose recognizes an odor is not fully understood , but there are apparently specific receptor sites for specific odors . In one explanation , recognition occurs when a scent molecule fits into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , causing a mechanical or chemical change in the cell . Bloodhounds apparently have denser concentrations of receptor sites tuned to human scents . These traits no doubt occurred fortuitously in a few animals early on . By breeding these animals together , and then breeding their offspring back to them , people have engineered a breed in which this highly specialized talent has become dominant . This brings us , after much hemming and hawing , to the real point : When a bloodhound trails a human being , what does it actually smell ? " Pull out the front of your shirt , " Hilda Onderdonk ordered , as the Rensselaer County Search and Rescue truck lurched and bumped through the streets of East Greenbush . " Do you feel hot air rising ? " The Onderdonks regularly lecture schoolchildren about bloodhounds , and they have this lesson down pat . " Your skin is 98.6 degrees , " she said , " and the air next to your body is also being heated to 98.6 degrees . Now , your body is constantly shedding skin , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bacteria that feed on them . These little pieces of skin are called rafts . ' " They come out over your head , " Onderdonk continued . " Then they get cooled and they fall . It 's like an invisible dandruff , and it falls in an umbrella effect around your feet . If there 's any breeze , it 'll get blown away . But sooner or later it gets caught in 66 Good Scents the grass or the bushes . This is a scent pattern , the way it falls , and a bloodhound trails that scent . " The human body , which consists of about sixty trillion living cells , sheds exposed skin at a rate of fifty million cells a day . So even a trail that has been dispersed by breezes may still seem rich to a bloodhound . The body also produces about thirty-one to fifty ounces of sweat a day . Neither this fluid nor the shed skin cells have much odor by themselves , but the bacteria working on both substances are another matter . In his book Life on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clean square centimeter of skin on the human shoulder at " multiples of a million . " As they go about their daily business breaking down lipids , or fatty substances , on the skin , these bacteria release volatile substances that strike the bloodhound nose as a whole constellation of distinctive scents . Diet , bathing habits , toiletries , the home environment , and other factors can all influence the number and variety of bacteria on the skin and also an individual 's scent . People from the same family not only share the same basic genetic constitution , but also the same soap or food or laundry detergent and will thus naturally have a similar scent . This can sometimes be confusing for a bloodhound , according to David Onderdonk ? for instance , when a child is missing and the family has just crisscrossed the neighborhood in a futile search . Still , everyone 's scent , or constellation of scents , strikes the bloodhound nose as distinctly individual ; it is another sort of fingerprint . The bloodhound has been bred to discriminate even among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end this is what makes the breed most remarkable . To demonstrate , the Onderdonks had arranged for a local police officer and his twin daughters to meet the rescue truck at a nearby golf course . En route , the Onderdonks ' dogs were utterly blase about the challenge ahead of them . Indeed , they were sleeping in their cages , each of them a heap of dewlap and flews dreaming on its own double cushion of foam // rubber , with a personal fan nearby for added comfort . Meanwhile , the human rescue workers sat on uncushioned plywood in the back , with no fans , bouncing across the potholes and sweatily throwing off volatile substances . Hilda Onderdonk was unapologetic about the disparity . " Could you find the victim ? " she inquired . In truth , this disparity extended to the Onderdonks ' whole way of life . They refer to themselves as guests in their own home and to their home as a large doghouse . Their front door is boarded over and barred to human access , but the two bloodhounds can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fenced-in yard . In the bathroom , the roll of toilet paper , a favorite bloodhound plaything , is hidden in a closet . David Onderdonk started to hide his dentures at night after waking up to find a bloodhound named Mountain Dew staring gleefully down at him with a mouth full of human uppers . The Onderdonks have owned bloodhounds for fifteen years , having got the idea much earlier when one of their six children disappeared briefly . Now that the children are grown , the elder Onderdonks said the rescue work gives meaning to their lives . They see the dogs as extensions of themselves , or vice versa . On the trail , David Onderdonk , who weighs just 130 pounds , stumps along behind his dog as if the two of them are permanently attached : " I 've been pulled over a cliff . I 've had my head split open . I 've got scars all over from being banged into things . " A bloodhound on the trail , he said , is very single-minded . Bloodhound owners tend to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Onderdonk gave instructions to the two fourteen-year-old girls . These twins were so identical , according to their father , that as infants they had to go back to the hospital several times to have their names straightened out according to their footprints . One of them must now wear her hair short , the other long , so their parents can tell them apart and also to prevent them from swapping places in school . According to their mother ; they do everything else , down to perfume and deodorant , alike . The long-haired girl left behind a nightshirt as a scent article for the dog , and the two of them struck out across the golf course 68 Good Scents for a hundred yards . Then they split , with long-hair heading out of sight on the left . The hound named Moonshine now came out of his cage , looking semiconscious . Onderdonk put on his harness , offered the hound the scent article and gave him the command : " Find ' em . " In an instant he was being dragged across the fairways by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twosomes and foursomes that had been hacking their way across this landscape all day . Moonshine was unmistakably on the trail of the two twins , and at the split he headed left at a lope , without a moment 's hesitation . He quickly overtook the long-haired twin , and gave her a quick confirming sniff of recognition . Then , just as suddenly as he began , Moonshine lapsed hack into happy indolence . Scent obviously has a power humans can never fully understand . For us , no sense plays more evocatively across the mind or has as quick a hold on the emotions . Yet it is a language that we perceive only distantly and incompletely , and one we perhaps suppress because we vaguely intimate its force . The bloodhound meanwhile inhales every nuance . It reads us better than we read ourselves , better than a mother reads her own child . Is it any wonder some people think bloodhounds are spooky ? 69 Looking for Mr. Griz The previous night , a grizzly bear named 104 had killed an elk calf hereabouts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The signal from her radio collar indicated she was still in the area , but it was n't possible to pin down the location from the sporadic clicking on a tracking receiver . " Well , shucky darn , " a researcher named Steve French commented . She was probably bedded down for the day with her three cubs in the trees above the road . We headed below , picking our way across a rough slope , between them and their most recent ungulate appetizer . Someone muttered uneasily about how touchy a sow with cubs can be toward intruders . Marilynn French , Steve 's wife and research partner , had spent three hours the night before watching 104 graze with studied nonchalance along this slope until the bear pounced on the elk calf . All that remained now were four lower legs and a spotted hide dressed out as cleanly as if a tannery had done the job . A researcher from the Interagency Grizzly Bear Study Team made 70 Looking for Mr. Griz notes in a little yellow pad . " You call that seventy-five percent ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I call that a hundred percent , " said French . " They licked the plate . " The government researcher raised his eyebrows in rueful assent and seized the opportunity to scan the hillside for movement . " Calvarium , " French remarked , picking up a splinter of skull . " Elk brain must be a real delicacy . " He began to expound on the grizzly 's dining habits , in an odd mix of Texas country boy dialect and precise anatomical detail , with maybe just a tad too much of the latter for the average person 's taste , meanwhile scouting through the trees to locate the flattened grass where the sow had bedded the night before and the turned-up dirt where it had dug licorice root with its finger-length claws . " This is a magic place for these guys , " he whispered . " They had cover . They had drinking water . They was eatin ' elk . It was cool . " Back at the carcass , the government researcher was collecting scat samples in plastic bags , less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about , " he remarked . " Being scared and picking up shit . " ( ) n the subject of being scared , the grizzly research world is in unanimous agreement . On almost any other subject even remotely connected to grizzly bears , however , there is fierce dispute . This includes , above all , the question of what bear work is all about , which is why I had come west to spend time with the Frenches . As practiced by professional scientists , grizzly bear work nowadays is mainly about numbers : While the grizzly population in western Canada and Alaska remains healthy , fewer than a thous:end grizzly bears remain in the Lower 48 states . They are confined to just 1 percent of their old territory , which formerly stretched from Ohio to the California coast . Most now live along the Continental Divide in northern Montana , with a concentration around // Glacier National Park . A smaller population of about two hundred bears survives in apparent isolation in the Yellowstone area , several hundred miles to the south . The federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the scientific number work since then has had to do with whether these populations are recovering and when they can be safely " de-listed . " To find out , researchers trap , tranquilize , ear-tag , lip-tattoo , radio-collar , and radio-track bears . They also employ abstruse demographic tools like " congruence analysis , " a " cumulative effects model , " a " habitat quality index , " even " volumetric analysis of grizzly bear scat by month , " all to log numbers on a computer , electronically crunch them , and figure out whether the government is doing a good job managing bears . By contrast , the Frenches , who are amateur naturalists , merely watch bears , something modern scientists rarely have time to do . They also film them . They are throwbacks to the nineteenth century , when numbers mattered less to naturalists than what they could see , and the most interesting work often came from diligent but uncredentialed observers in the field . In the case of the Frenches , fifteen years of grizzly work have helped scientists appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become of elk calves , or how they like to disappear to the mountaintops in August and gorge themselves on rich pockets of estivating moths . This tradition of straightforward field observation has revived in recent decades , most notably in the person of the late Dian Fossey , and the Frenches view themselves as following in her footsteps ? with the small caveat that the grizzly , unlike the gorilla , really does eat people . Unlike Fossey , however , the Frenches generally watch their subjects from a distance , partly out of selfpreservation , but mainly to avoid displacing them from their limited habitat . They also avoid politics . In the disputatious world of the grizzly , where the egos tend to be as big and quarrelsome as the bears , this is n't as simple as it sounds . 72 Looking for Mr. Griz French is a short , athletic , neo ? mountain man , given to chewing tobacco and spitting it into an empty can of diet soda . He was wearing a battered stetson when we met , over scraggly brown hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bow fender on a tugboat . In their lectures , Marilynn , who has the lean build and the understated manner of a long-distance runner , narrates the basic facts about bear behavior ; Steve handles the color commentary . She describes their observation that earthworms tend to bunch up under tufted hairgrass in wet weather . He gets to talk about how the grizzlies " flip ' em over and , thp-thp-thp , it 's like spaghetti . " Until he takes off the stetson and puts his black reading glasses low down on the bridge of his nose , you would not guess by looking at him that he is a physician trained in surgery . Nor does he exactly want you to know that for six months of the year he is director of emergency medical services at Evanston Regional Hospital in Wyoming . " I 'm a Texas truck driver 's son who happens to have a doctor 's degree , " he said . Attitudes in and around his chosen profession make him edgy . " I was n't raised to be an asshole . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a surgical resident at the University of Utah in the 1970s , while patching together people bears had taken apart . " The first time we had a patient that had been chawed on by a griz , I thought , What the hell is this ? ' If the guy had been beaten up with a pool cue I wouldn'a thought anything of it . But what kind of animal does this ? " On vacations , he and Marilynn drove up to Yellowstone , and like other tourists familiar with the proverbial association between bears and woods , they wasted a lot of time looking in barren thickets of lodgepole pine without ever seeing a grizzly . Other interests intervened . French weighed 226 pounds in 1977 when he got disgusted with being a fat physician and started to run . He quickly became good enough to clock a 2:18:40 marathon and compete in the 1980 Olympic Trials . Marilynn had // gone back to school and was also running , on the University of Utah 's national championship cross-country team . Then she got pregnant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a canyon where her family had hiked for generations had been bulldozed , dammed , and turned into a reservoir . " I saw how quickly things like that can happen , " she said . Sending off checks to environmental groups with large offices in Washington , D.C. , no longer seemed adequate . " I wanted some place I could have memories with my daughter , " she said . The Yellowstone wilderness seemed permanent , and the study of grizzly bears sounded , in 1983 , like one good cause worth a lifetime of effort . At that point , a lot of people , including the Frenches , feared that the grizzlies for which Yellowstone was famous were mostly dead . In the summer of 1970 , Yellowstone had shut down its open-pit dumps , abruptly cutting the bears off from what had been their main source of food for more than a half-century . The motive was sound : to return fat , Twinkie-dependent bears to a more natural way of life , in accord with government policy that a national park should function as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bears then were " habituated " to human presence , and " conditioned " to human food . Park rangers hoped that breaking this connection would get the bears away from roads , where bearjams and maulings were a perennial problem . The decision touched off one of the bitterest disputes the environmental community has ever known , and it remains the seminal political question for the Frenches and every other student of the grizzly . From the start , the Park Service faced vocal opposition from Frank and John Craighead , independent researchers who had pioneered radio-tracking and other techniques in a study of the park 's dump bears . They predicted that closing the dumps would cause grizzlies to starve and become extinct from Yellowstone . As 74 grizzlies dispersed from the dump sites , the Park Service began to kill or remove bears that continued to seek human food , and other conservationists quickly joined the protest . By the Park Service 's own count , it eliminated 83 grizzlies in 1970-1971 , a huge percentage from a genetically isolated population later estimated at 234 bears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many people believed the unreported losses were much higher . Critics denounced it as " an extermination campaign " conceived to make even this last vestige of grizzly country safe for people . The idea that the Yellowstone grizzly had been permanently subjugated , if not destroyed , became a set piece of environmentalist lore . The Frenches , who had read Frank Craighead 's book Track of the Grizzly , an account of the debacle , generally accepted this grim view . But as they accumulated seasons in the field , and as // the bear population recovered during the 1980s , they began to think instead that the closing of the dumps may ultimately have set the grizzlies free . " The dump bears were like overfed pigs at the trough , " said Steve , and it affected both their appearance and their behavior . For example , in the dump days , when up to ninety grizzlies a night brawled around a single dump , researchers believed grizzlies to have minimal courtship behavior . It was common for bears to move unceremoniously from one partner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wild , said Marilynn , " We did n't find that . Bears spent weeks together going through this very complex , ritualized courting relationship . " Here Steve cut in with color commentary : " He comes up very aggressively looking to mount her , and she physically rejects him . She 'll cuff him and knock the shit out of him , and he 'll take it . He just watches her and follows her around . Over the course of days , she begins to tolerate him and allow him to get closer , maybe lay his head across her rump . If he gets too aggressive , she 'll turn around and whack him . But eventually they become very affectionate and cuddly . " " You see very big adults playing just like cubs , " said Marilynn . " They 'll be standing on their feet and pawing each other , or rolling around on the grass like when they were little . " The inference the Frenches drew from such observations was that Yellowstone 's grizzlies might be better off now , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known that the federal government never does anything right , not even accidentally . Despite their aversion to politics , this idea put the Frenches on a collision course with widespread common knowledge that the bears were still out there starving ? common knowledge vividly embodied in the person of Doug Peacock , an amateur grizzly watcher of far greater renown than the Frenches . Peacock has done more than anyone to keep alive the memory of the grizzly debacle of the 1970s . Even now , he likens what the government did to Yellow-76 Looking for Mr. Griz stone 's grizzlies to what it had done to the villages of the Blackfeet and the Vietnamese . To Peacock , suggesting that the bears might be better off now is like suggesting the Indians were better off for Wounded Knee . This is , moreover , a collision in which popular opinion appears stacked against the Frenches , who remain unknown outside the grizzly research world . Peacock , on the other hand , is a fixture of western folklore . He was the model for Hayduke , the beery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of Edward Ahbey 's cult novel The Monkey Wrench Gang and its sequel , Hay ( hike Lives . He has also chronicled his own experiences among grizzlies in a short film , Peacock 's War , and in an autobiography , Grizzly Years . The writer Peter Matthiessen has described him as having " more experience with wild grizzlies . . . than anyone alive . " As I thought about the Yellowstone grizzlies , it seemed to me that Peacock 's life among the bears provided a shadowy counterpoint to the Frenches ' . Peacock began to study grizzlies at Yellowstone and Glacier in the mid-1970s at about the same time Steve French was sewing up bear-mauled campers in Salt Lake City and on short stints in t he Yellowstone Park hospital . But where French readily admits that he came to Yellowstone expecting something like Six Flags over Texas , Peacock already knew wilderness and he knew how to find bears . He grew up " running loose in the North Woods " of Michigan , learning not just wilderness , but Indian lore . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a major find of fourthousand-year-old Indian corpses wrapped in beaver pelts . He also got drunk for the first time and killed fourteen pigs in a %hooting spree . He studied geology at the University of Michigan , but dropped out and headed west . In his book , he depicts himself in the late 1960s returning to the American wilderness and its fiercest incarnation , the grizzly , as a kind of catharsis , a way of forgetting what he had seen during a two-year tour patching up // soldiers and children as a Green Beret medic in Vietnam . The grizzly was also a way of reviving the war 's intensity of feeling , " the naked authenticity of living or dying . " With the idea of talking about that era in Yellowstone and about the Frenches , I looked up Peacock at his home on the outskirts of Tucson , where a Park Service sign in the front yard asserts , " Remain At Your Car All The Time , " and a bumper sticker in the window says , " Developers Go Build in Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Abbey , Peacock 's closest friend , characterized in The Monkey Wrench Gang as " a manicdepressive psychopath , " sullen , inarticulate , and sodden with beer . Apart from extraordinary native sense in the wild , and an interesting penchant for reducing heavy construction machinery to scrap , Hayduke seemed like a one-dimensional sort of folk hero . " Hayduke was a dolt , " said Peacock , who plainly was n't . He turned out , in truth , to be a complex , intelligent , and highly likable character . Physically , he looked like a bear himself , built low and thick , suggesting considerable power , and with a broad , dishlike face , a grizzled beard , and milky brown eyes . He grinned readily , talked loud , and was as critical of himself as of anyone else ? with the exception of the Park Service and , by extension , the Frenches , whom he plainly despised , describing them in his kinder moments as apologists for Yellowstone . For him , wilderness was the cardinal value , and Yellowstone was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoo but a little less than an ecosystem , or anything wild . " Wildness also mattered personally . He despised bureaucracies , describing himself as an outlaw . His preferred style was to slip through the shadows of society and disappear into the woods like a guerrilla . The Frenches , by contrast , work closely with government researchers and describe themselves unromantically as " GS-Zeros . " In his book , after fulminating about the events of the 1970s , which continue to outrage him , Peacock draws one original con-78 Looking for Mr. Griz elusion about the bear itself . Yellowstone is not exterminating its grizzlies , he writes . But by continuing to remove troublemaking hears , even at the present greatly reduced level , it is domesticating them : " The predatory segment of the population had probably been killed off selectively , and continues to be culled . . . because predatory bears are bolder and more visible . " The end result , he suggests , will be " an animal who looks like a grizzly , albeit a small one , but whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear . " For Peacock , the Frenches are collaborators in this process . His conclusion turns out , however , to be wrong . In the summer of 1983 , Steve and Marilynn French put in their first long stint of serious bear watching at Yellowstone , and what they began to document , at a time when hardly anybody else was looking , was the emergence of a grizzly fundamentally different from its predecessors at the dump . Number-crunching scientists knew the grizzly population was much younger , which was unsurprising after the " control actions " of the 1970s . The bears also weighed less , by a third to a half , and had a lower reproductive rate , which seemed to support the contention of critics that they were starving . In 1983 , Frank Craighead was still urging the park to kill elk and hand out the carcasses to save the bears . The Frenches steered clear of this spat and set out on what they conceived of as an educational mission , to " deliver the heart of the grizzly bear in grizzly country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Peacock 's approach to the grizzly was instinctive and characteristically haphazard , the Frenches ' was utterly methodical : They took a weeklong course at the Yellowstone Institute to find out what they 'd been doing wrong over the previous five years . Then they threw themselves into the grizzly world with the same intensity that gets a fat physician from heart-attack weight to a 2:18 marathon in under three years . Their work soon earned the // attention of Yellowstone 's research community , which generally resists independent researchers . The Frenches were witnessing the reeducation of the grizzly bear as a predator ? and this was news the Park Service was eager to hear . The closing of the dumps in 1970 still seemed to critics like disastrously bad timing for the bears : The elk population then was artificially low as a result of old-style park management , and the native cutthroat trout were just beginning a comeback . But as these other resources recovered , the Frenches documented how quickly the " new " grizzly was adapting . Their efforts to witness bear behavior and record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond what salaried researchers might have done . During the fires of 1988 , the Frenches stayed on so long listening to two radio-collared grizzlies on their receiver that Steve thought his truck was about to explode in the advancing flames . ( It did n't , and the two grizzlies were back the next day working the burned-over meadow . ) Another time , he spent three days in a tree , standing on a narrow , nailed-up crosspiece and sleeping in a " wall womb " hammock , to see how grizzlies fished in spawning season . Together , he and Marilynn watched a single bear for ten days and recorded that it killed an average of ninety-eight cutthroat trout a day . One bear killed twenty-four fish in twentyeight minutes . From late April into September , the Frenches now spend about ten hours a day , seven days a week , in the field , starting out at five in the morning and again around five in the afternoon . They average several grizzlies a day . In between they write up their field reports , run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the Frenches are not number-crunchers , their field work has nonetheless become highly scientific . Among other things , they now record air temperature , barometric pressure , time of day , behavior , and location by Universal Tranverse Mercator ticks on a topographic map . On the back of a typical field report , a hand-drawn map of one observation looks like a football play , all x 's and arrows . 80 Looking for Mr. Griz Each x represents a place where the bear dug up a pocket gopher cache , which can contain up to two quarts of roots and bulbs and also , with luck , a pocket gopher . " I 've seen ' em dig a trench twenty feet long just to get this one little gooey gopher , " said Steve . " I ca n't perceive that it 's worth the energy , but they get all excited when they hear that little guy squeak . It 's kind of like a Twinkie . " The Yellowstone grizzly , he said , is an intelligent , inquisitive , highly adaptive animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing fine on a remarkably diverse assortment of natural foods , and for grizzlies as for fat physicians , thinner may sometimes be better . One evening we hiked out into a broad grassy valley popular with grizzlies . Steve and Marilynn were backpacking about fifty pounds of spotting scopes and camera equipment each , which we set up on a knoll overlooking scores of grazing elk . " We pay attention to what the elk are doing , " said Steve . " There are more of them than there are of us , and they have a vested interest in looking for grizzlies . " This is especially so in June when the elk are just finished calving . The elk cow 's harrowing survival strategy is to bed down her nursling for the day in the sagebrush meadows , and walk away . The calves would be too easy to spot if they stayed with their mothers , and for their first month , they are too wobbly to flee a predator . The calf must lie still and rely on the camouflage of its speckled coat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird dog will not see it and snatch it up . A small point of clarification : We were of course rooting for the grizzlies . Elk calves are common as pennies in Yellowstone , and they now serve , said Steve , in roughly the capacity of " a Bobo platter in a Chinese restaurant . Easy pickins . Little bites . " He looked out over the blank landscape and remarked , with a hint of vicarious hunger , " I would predict that there are thirty elk calves bedded down in that sagebrush meadow . " // Alas , the grizzlies did not take the bait , and for our bloodyminded thoughts we were duly punished . In the middle of a meadow on the hike out , a huge bison rolled straight at us , snorting malevolently . There were no trees to climb or rocks behind which to cower , so we discreetly accelerated , and the bison eventually veered off . " I swear , I know we are more concerned with bison than with bears , any day , " said Steve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Yo ' mama be a ruminant ! He 's probably lowest on the bison totem pole , so he had to push us around and show he was dominant . Now he can walk back and say , I be bad . ' " Over the years , the Frenches have frequently been run up trees by moose or bison . They have also been caught on a mountaintop in a thunderstorm when the lightning was clapping down around them and they had to squinch among the rocks and plug their ears to avoid being deafened . They have never , however , been treed by a grizzly . Climbing a tree to escape a charging grizzly ranks with such other not-so-bright ideas as the anti-bear spray now available in what French calls " the piss ' em off " size ; a charging grizzly is just too fast . Better to fall on one 's face , cover the back of the neck , and lie still . In any case , close calls do n't figure largely in the Frenches ' reputation , and this turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their work . Though they also spend time in the backcountry , the Frenches do some of their best bear watching from one of the most heavily traveled roads in Yellowstone , overlooking Antelope Creek . They pulled in at five one morning during my visit , coasting downhill to their viewing point with the engine off . For the next two hours , they talked in whispers lest they disturb bears out on the ridges below them . When a tourist stopped and let a yapping dog out of the car , Steve quietly suggested that someone strangle it . Grizzly bears are sensitive to every new human intrusion , including lap dogs and scientific research . What they do not see , he added , they often smell . He was once keeping his distance and watching a 82 Looking for Mr. Griz bear muzzle-deep in carrion when the wind shifted and the bear lifted its nose and turned to stare straight at him . Grizzlies generally take such hints to flee before people get close : " The first thing you know is the flash of butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " French panted , miming terror . " It 's already over before it gets your attention . But it still gets your attention . " As the day lengthened , tourists in Winnebagoes whipped past and sometimes stopped to ask questions . " Elks and grizzlies ? " one man mused . " Are they compatible ? " Unperturbed , French peered intently through his spotting scope at a goosed-up elk on a distant ridge , followed its gaze to the treeline , and at 7:25 said , " I got a griz . " The distance turned out to be an un-macho three miles . This is not the stuff that made Dian Fossey a movie heroine . When I visited Doug Peacock , he derided the Antelope Creek watch as " a travesty " of the tamed Yellowstone : " Watching the hears copulate through telescopes and giving them names . " ( In fact , the Frenches refer to bears by number , not by name . ) His own methods smack more of True Adventure : " When he 's in bear country , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bear would , the way he moves through the bushes , like a bear foraging . We 'll be walking along and he 'll be taking the point , and all of a sudden he 'll stop , either point to his nose or point to his ears , and after a couple of minutes , there 's a bear . He can sense their presence . " But there was more than that , said the friend : " I do n't know what it is with Peacock . It 's like he 's got this innate trait with bears where they seem to be tolerant of him . " This ursine aura , and the sense of personal connection with individual grizzlies , is at the heart of Peacock 's underground celebrity in the West . It is also the central flaw in this method , as it was for Dian Fossey , too . Like the Frenches , Peacock argues that what the grizzly needs most is to be left alone . He has nothing good to say about eartagging , lip-tattooing , and other techniques @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mainly to habituate // the bears . He wages an informal and sporadic campaign to protect grizzlies from human encroachments . At Glacier National Park , he forced federal authorities to prosecute a helicopter pilot who buzzed the bears for the pleasure of tourists , and he admits to poaching livestock on public land , where they are a temptation to grizzlies and an excuse for grizzly control . But what Peacock can not seem to do is leave the bears alone himself . He is drawn among them , like Fossey sitting among her gorillas , and he reports that they generally treat him " much as they did other , more dominant bears . " Sometimes , with his head cocked to one side , he talks a bear out of charging . Sometimes he stares a bear down . His stories have to do less with how bears react to their changing environment than how they react to Doug Peacock . What the Frenches give us , by keeping a discreet distance from the bear , is a portrait of an American animal , in the wild . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the context of the Yellowstone grizzly 's future , which continues to lie not with the Frenches or Peacock , but with the number-crunchers and their cumulative-effects model . The model allows demographers to assign a quantitative value to every proposed new development in grizzly country , in terms of the effect it will have on the population of breeding females . This number is typically a fraction of a bear per year , allowing each developer to tout his project as relatively harmless . But fractions have a way of adding up . I sat down with John Varley , the park 's chief of research , to review the developments now being built or proposed in the greater Yellowstone ecosystem , including expanded tourist accommodations within the park itself . Varley saw little room for long-term optimism . The cumulative effects are adding up , he said , to the point where society must now choose whether it wants grizzly bears at Yellowstone or new hotels . Without some change in direction , he 84 Looking for Mr. Griz predicted that the bear population would begin to decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One of the new developments under consideration at the time of my visit , for example , was a gold mine expected to bring six hundred people to Cooke City just north of the park . " Everybody 's going to kick and scream , " Steve French said . But society loves a compromise . " In the end they 'll come up with some environmental mitigation and call it a win-win situation . " He paused . " You do n't have a winwin situation when you put six hundred people into grizzly habitat . Three years down the road , it 's going to be something else over here . Win-win . And then it 'll be win-win over here , and winwin here . And each one taken separately will be insignificant to the grizzly bear and its long-term survival . But we will win-win the hear to death . " In 1997 the U.S. government ultimately found just such a winwin solution to the Cooke City mine proposal , persuading a Canadian company to give up its claim to the land in exchange for $65 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to cost us $65 million every time we resolve a grizzly habitat conflict ? " French asked afterward . " If so , we ca n't afford it . " Here , however , one of Peacock 's criticisms of the Frenches sticks . Peacock regards it as an environmentalist 's obligation to resist such development , to oppose the removal of habituated bears , to blow the whistle on concessionaires who regard Yellowstone as a profit center and operate in flagrant disregard for park wildlife . ( Bears continue to become habituated in part because of negligent handling of food and waste by park restaurants and hotels . These are subjects on which the Frenches also have strong feelings , and yet they keep silent . They are disciplined enough about abstaining from politics that they will not even talk about Peacock on the record . The difference perhaps is that where Peacock is always drifting through , the Frenches intend to spend their lives at Yellowstone . They have formed a Yellowstone Grizzly // Foundation , and they talk in terms of a thirty-year study , which depends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are conscious that a previous independent research team , the Craigheads , had to go elsewhere after breaking publicly with the Park Service . Thus even the Cooke City gold mine had to be somebody else 's fight . " Our drive is for conservation through long-term public education , " said Steve French . " You read the government literature , and they 're talking about all the things they 're doing for bears . You read the conservation literature , and they 're telling people what they 're doing for bears . All we 're telling people about is bears . " Under the circumstances , it is natural to wonder whether education alone is enough . If the Frenches do n't speak out , it falls to people like Peacock to kick and scream , to act outrageously on the grizzly bear 's behalf . But for all his folkloric appeal , Peacock lacks the credibility to persuade society at large that at least in this one small place , our dominion over nature ought to be on hold ; moreover , the Yellowstone grizzly of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth the trouble of saving . If we want to know what Peacock is kicking about , if we want to savor each small discovery about how much more marvelous the untamed grizzly bear is than another air-conditioned hotel , then it is the Frenches that society needs to hear . For them , as for Fossey and just about every other conservation scientist in the world today , the politics of survival are inescapable . Two mornings after the bison episode , we hiked out into a sagebrush bottom in time to see a long line of elk and their calves ( the bait ) making an exodus from the area , a bad omen . The Frenches set up their cameras on a high point above a grassy landscape corrugated with deep draws . There was a stream ahead and , across it , a low meadow leading up to green , aspen-filled chutes among the bluffs . A group of bighorn sheep crossed a high slope oppo-86 Looking for Mr. Griz site , and a couple of sandhill cranes made their creaky , chittering sound like wood rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right , a small herd of elk grazed . " We got to watch our flanks , " said Steve , and he started to tell a story about a time when a bear inadvertently ran a herd of elk right at them from the side . Before he could finish , frightened elk bolted into view on our left flank . " Oh , heavens , " he said . " What 's going on ? Get ready , Marilynn , there could be a bear over there . " " There 's a bear , there 's a bear ! " she shouted back . " Right on ' em . " The grizzly came into view at a rocky gallop , three-quarter speed , with its loose flanks rippling in the sunlight . Then it disappeared after the elk into a draw , direction unknown . The bear was five hundred yards away , less than thirty seconds for a grizzly . While we waited for it to reappear , Steve digressed about a grizzly they once timed on a long run uphill in broken terrain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thirty-two miles an hour , " and he was n't even pissed at anybody , " he said . He began to reflect in the anatomical mode : " They 're plantigrade , like us ; they walk on their heels . Elk are digiform ; they walk on their toes . So why are bears so darn fast ? Do they have incredibly fast twitch fibers ? Sprinters have a high concentration of fast twitch fibers . Or does it have to do with the way the tendons cross the joints and the bones articulate ? " He spat tobacco ; it was a subject for future research . " If that bear comes up over the ridge , " he concluded , " why do n't we all bend over and kiss our asses good-bye . Because we 're gon na be a helluva lot easier to catch than that fuckin ' elk . " The bear reappeared on the other side of the river , shaking off water like a dog . A half-dozen elk stood nervously on a knoll . They walked straight toward the grizzly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least until the chase begins . The Frenches refer to the way a whole herd will suddenly point in the same direction , even when the landscape prevents individual elk // from actually seeing the bear , as networking . The grizzly ignored them and lay down in the low meadow to work on a recent kill . " Subadult , two hundred fifty pounds , dark brown , " Marilynn remarked to Steve , who was making field notes . The Frenches had watched a sow nail two calves in thirty seconds on this same spot ten days earlier , and they speculated about whether this bear was simply working over an old carcass . The bear held on with its claws and drew something up with his teeth . " I do n't know , " said Steve , " that 's awful ... " " ... chewy looking , " said Marilynn . " I wonder if he could 've gotten it last night ? " After a few minutes , a cow approached to within ten yards . " That 's real typical , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to have the urge to nurse , and there 's the separation . She 's had that calf with her for a few weeks . " Another cow moved in behind , popped up her calf from its daybed , and escorted it out on tiptoe . The grizzly continued to eat for another twenty minutes . " He 's walking , " Marilynn said finally . " 7:08 . " It developed that the bear already had two kills , but he continued to sniff through the sagebrush in search of other elk calves . " The cows are coming down to see him . " " There 's a calf right above him , " said Steve . " Look at ' em run ; look at ' em run ! He 's way off to the left . The next place you 're going to see him is at that cut in the river . " Calves tumbled into the river in a panic and swam across , struggling up the cut bank . On our side of the river , elk suddenly started to pour up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screaming of the calves , like seagulls , and the strangled barking of the cows . " There he is again , " said Marilynn . " Coming around this way . " If the grizzlies are learning to be predators , said Steve , the elk are learning to be prey . " For a while they were like domestic cows , they thought they could just get fat and happy . " But now they 're developing defensive strategies . In the Frenches ' film 88 Looking for Mr. Griz footage , three cows pull up beside a charging bear and attempt to shoulder it off the track of a fleeing calf ; another trio cuts directly across a bear 's path to break its visual lock on its prey . Sometimes the calf escapes . Sometimes it stumbles , or the bear butts it down with its muzzle . Even then , a cow may harass a bear enough to distract it and let the calf escape . Steve headed off to a vantage point a hundred yards away and then came sprinting back : " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard some elk screaming . Can you believe this little guy or what ? " The elk came racing into view , the calves struggling to remain among them . Their brown flanks glistened with sweat and they were panting , their pink mouths open , eyes wild . The herd circled up onto a knoll . In hot pursuit , the grizzly 's mouth was also open , with a look of pure joy . He flew up the slope and hurtled in among them , spinning one way and then the other , snapping wildly , scattering elk like a kid playing blindman 's bluff . The cows were all around him , confusing him , and the calves danced away just out of reach . Then the whole wild assembly disappeared down the far slope . " Goddam ! " Steve French yelled , from behind his movie camera . " Why could n't I have a full roll now ? " Later , on the hike out through head-high sagebrush , a perfect spot for stumbling into a grizzly , he remarked , " You think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellowstone , with Old Faithful , the boardwalks , the Winnebagoes , the two and a half million people . " And later still he added , " One of those dump bears woulda had a heart attack . " 89 What 's Nice ? Mice . If you had gone to the Orange County Fair in California a while ago , and picked your way past the zeppole booths and the sideshows ( " Giant Steer ? 10,000 Hamburgers on the Hoof ! " ) , you might by sheer good luck have met a comely music and mathematics teacher named Roxanne Fitzgerald . She was surrounded by small cages at a booth in the livestock shed , and she wore her heart on the brim of her sailor 's cap , which was embroidered with the words : " What 's Nice ? Rats and Mice ! " Yes , and you would have met plenty of people who agreed with her , or disagreed only about which was nicer . At this particular outing of the American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association , mousers were in the majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bantam reds , to show their prizes : hairless mice , frizzy mice , long-haired mice , Siamese satins , orange satin selfs , agouti standards ? and to discuss the fine points of the mousing life . You might , for instance , have heard Don Fredriksen , a boat carpenter , lamenting his wife 's distaste for agouti mice , which 90 What 's Nice ? Mice . have a rather mousey gray-brown color . She lets their nine-yearold son , Josiah , keep a Chinese water dragon in his bedroom , Fredriksen was saying , but agoutis " look like house mice to her and she does n't want ' em around . " You would have seen much sympathetic nodding . And you would have heard the mice themselves discussed with a discernment , even a delectation , that was utterly foreign to the everyday " eeek-it's-a-mouse " world . Indeed , at that moment , Debbie Prosser , the show judge , held a lilac long-haired satin in her open palm as if it were a jewel . She ruffled its coat gently with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stern , meticulous judge , she had already sent a hairless mouse away from the judging table for having unsightly tufts on the tops of its feet ; she had marked down a silver tan because its nose was too pointy and its whiskers had been chewed off . But Prosser had also been sensitive . At one point , she cupped a listless mouse in her hands and held it up to her ear , as if to hear its confession . " When they have respiratory problems , you can hear them wheeze , " she explained . And looking into the eyes of another contender , she said , " You 're a very nice mouse , you just do n't compete . I 'm sorry . " For the mice who do compete , the day culminates in the bestof-show judging , when Prosser holds up her choice and declares , " That 's the ideal mouse , right there . " The winner belongs to young Josiah Fredriksen , and it is an agouti . " That 's great , " Josiah 's dad says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them ) . " He 's been up on the table a couple of times before , but that 's the first grand championship he 's ever had . " He hesitates , then inquires , " Should we clap ? " A very good question . Should we clap for the mouse ? Should we clap , that is , for the house mouse , which is what we are talking about here , whether in plain or fancy versions , whether gutterhorn or grand champion ? You do not need to be a musophile . . . a // sminthophile . . . a lover of mice . . . to consider the question seriously . Whether we like them or not , mice are a hit , an improbable success story , if only in that they have distributed themselves more widely across the planet than any other mammal apart from Homo sapiens . They have done it with short legs and bad eyes , too , and with less help from us than we generally choose to think . The house mouse has n't merely traveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapting its modest physical endowment to an extraordinary range of habitats . House mice live at the bottom of English coal mines and at the summit of Mauna Kea in Hawaii . They live in the coastal deserts of Peru and fifteen thousand feet up in the Andes . They dwell in frozen meat lockers , snuggling in the carcasses that feed them . In Australia , where a few centuries ago they were unknown , house mice have made themselves the most common small mammal everywhere . And they have managed to colonize an island near Antarctica where even humans are too sensible to live . They reside in the walls of this writer 's house , and nest in my shredded tax records . The Bible says the meek shall inherit the earth . The house mouse is living proof that they already have . 92 What 's Nice ? Mice . So do we clap ? The question is complicated by a curious paradox . While humans have lived with mice for millennia and while we have studied them in endless detail as scientific models for ourselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aficionados of the American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association are more interested in mouse aesthetics than in mouse behavior . Nor do more than a handful of researchers care about where they came from or how they live . Mice , one researcher told me contemptuously , " are n't real animals . " This ignorance is even odder because mice are a subject on which humans harbor deep and contradictory feelings . A mouse , like no other animal , can evoke in an instant feelings of keen empathy and cold-blooded mayhem . We think of mice as cute little critters ? those anxious , hyperthyroid eyes , the fanlike ears , the nostrils sampling the air so frantically they seem to oscillate . But we also call them vermin and make a beaten path , as Ralph Waldo Emerson said , to the door of anyone who comes up with a better way to kill them . So if we are deciding whether or not to applaud the mouse 's spectacular success , we had better think about the tangled ways humans view mice , and also about mice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first tangles has to do with just what qualifies as a mouse . Any small , furry rodent will do , for some people , and hundreds of species fit that description . There are pocket mice , pygmy mice and fat mice , leaf-eared mice and striped-grass mice , American harvest mice and dormice . Australia naturally has kangaroo mice , but so does New Guinea , and neither species has much connection with the American jumping mouse . The Middle Fast has porcupine mice . Southeast Asia has marmoset mice ( also known , less winningly , as Asiatic climbing rats ) . And in South America , chinchilla mice are trapped for their warm fur , which is used to make garment trimmings and even whole robes . Grouping these animals together under the common rubric mice " is a bit like mixing beavers and guinea pigs . Scientists // classify them in different genera , different families , or even different suborders of Rodentia . Nor does it entirely simplify the question to talk only about house mice . In this country , for instance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all habitats . About fifty species are native to this hemisphere and predate the arrival of humans . But they will sometimes live indoors , too , and it will afford little comfort to householders who hear them scrabbling under the floor to know that they are not , scientifically speaking , house mice . No , it is necessary to simplify the discussion further to those small furry rodents that have climbed into humanity 's back pocket and made themselves our companions full-time and in all places , the members of the genus Mus whose name is thought to come from the Sanskrit verb " to steal . " Mus ( rhymes with cuss ) is the house mouse proper , and as such it has insinuated itself not just into every corner of the planet , but into our culture . The Greeks spoofed The Iliad in a satire about a one-day war between mice and frogs , with great orations before battle and with the gods butting in on both sides . They also built a temple to Apollo Smintheus ( Apollo " the Mouser " ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of white mice to augur the future . If they had augured right , they would have seen a future of mice everywhere , superhero mice , mice to whom millions of children would sing their allegiance . My generation was raised on Mickey Mouse and Mighty Mouse ( " Here he comes to save the day . . . " ) , and my eldest son doted on Danger Mouse , the James Bond of rodents ( " Powerhouse , " a breathy female vocalist intoned ) . My father grew up with Ignatz Mouse , a dyspeptic comic-strip underdog ( or ubermaus ) who was always hurling bricks at his counterpart , Krazy Kat . What all these representations say about mice is that we tend to mistake them for humans . We seem to like mice , and to empathize with them , at least in part because they are so thoroughly subject to capricious fate . One moment their lives are the picture of domestic tranquility , the very next a king snake 94 What 's Nice ? Mice . engorges Number 34 son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly affecting when capricious fate arrives in the form of ourselves , as on the infamous day in November 1785 when Robert Burns drove his plow through the nest of a " Wee , sleekit , cow'rin ' , tim'rous beastie . " Mice lead lives of chronic instability and routine disaster ; they tend to remind us , when they turn up cat-mauled on the front stoop , that we do , too . Burns wrote , " The best-laid schemes o ' mice and men gang aft a-gley . " Or as one mouse researcher has put it : " There is something terribly familiar about the awful situation of a mouse in the world . " But beyond that , mice have pluck . They have a way of carrying on , of getting by , even as the world crumbles daily about their ears . Forced to abandon one cozy home , they quickly set up another and another ? and they survive . An 1859 report mentions a barrel of biscuits that had been sealed in Aberdeen and opened in the Canadian Arctic more than fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( except the people who wanted to eat the biscuits ) could help but admire the mouse 's heroic persistence ? Until recently , most scientists who bothered to think about it believed that the house mouse originated in the Russian steppes , and then freeloaded its way westward , like the mouse in the biscuits , as a stowaway in the caravans of migrating humans . But it appears now not to have been that simple . Scientists say that what we call house mice are , in fact , several separate species , Mus domesticus and Mus musculus being the principal . These two species went their separate ways one million to three million years ago , and they developed their essential characteristics well before humans settled down to an agricultural way of life . They developed , in other words , as " real animals , " and we need to see them that way ? rather than as mere appendages to human civilization ? to understand how they have spread out and colonized the world . Mice apparently never came to a great turn in the evolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for all with human beings . Commensalism seems to have occurred repeatedly , // and not always permanently . Scientists use the term " fortuitous preadaption " : Mice were already accustomed to some feature of the environment , such as rock crevices , which later made it easier for them to live in barns and houses . It certainly required none of the sacrifices cats made , for instance , in submitting to domestication . The ease with which house mice can go feral even now suggests that they remain much the same animals as their distant forebears who were unacquainted with Homo sapiens . As to how early house mice dispersed themselves through the Old World , they may have walked . Richard Sage , who was a researcher with the University of Missouri ? Columbia in the 1980s , studied the two predominant species at a hybrid zone where their ranges meet along the old border between East and West Germany .

Mus domesticus inhabit the Mediterranean countries and western Europe , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their common point of origin is unknown ( though the latest mitochondrial DNA evidence suggests northern India as a likely possibility ) . But Sage theorizes that after the last glaciation , the two species may have repopulated the northern countries independently , M. domesticus coming up via Morocco and Spain and perhaps colonizing some areas on the heels of us humans . ( If each generation sent pioneers a thousand meters into territory where no mouse had ever gone , and if there were a new generation every month or so , even a shortsighted , bandy-legged creature like the mouse could find its way from Spain to Denmark , say , given several thousand years . ) It is even possible that in some places humans moved into the mouse 's cave , rather than vice versa . Mice simply had the sense to recognize a good thing when they saw it . If they had gotten far on their own , they were to get e'en farther in the new worlds opened up to them by agriculture avid human transportation . But fortuitous preadaption to human company does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin 96 What 's Nice ? Mice . got to be where they are today ( that is , in the walls of my house , and probably yours , too ) . To understand why house mice are so successful almost everywhere , we need to know more about how they live . Their system of social organization is , curiously , both deeply isolationist and at the same time conducive to colonizing brave new worlds . Much of our knowledge of this system comes from Peter Crowcroft , an English researcher who spent a sizable part of his career in a darkened , windowless room figuring out what the mice around him were up to . Though his ultimate business was extermination , Crowcroft liked mice . He was inclined to settle down among them on the floor , and he sometimes sat still for an extra twenty minutes while a mouse " had a nap between my trouser leg and me . " Crowcroft 's working method was to introduce various combinations of mice into the room , which was set up with a grid of nest boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one early instance , having allowed a mouse named Bill to become established , Crowcroft introduced another male named Charlie . " I was quite unprepared , " Crowcroft later wrote , " for the stark savagery with which Bill hurled himself upon Charlie in the first instant of their meeting . " Far from being the " cooperative little fellows " Crowcroft had expected , mice were acting like " savage individualists . " But for all their ferocity , mouse fights seldom resulted in death ; they tended to be played out according to set patterns of behavior , culminating in the dominance of one mouse over another . And just to make sure the subordinate mouse got the point , the dominant one chased him every time they met . As Crowcroft introduced additional mice , a social hierarchy developed . Charlie lit somewhere in the middle , subordinate to Bill but dominant over other mice . Unhappily for Charlie , other researchers have since found that the important privileges of rank accrue only to the top mouse . A // ominant mouse engages in urine marking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his urine is qualitatively different . ince mice communicate largely by scent and can distinguish individuals on that basis alone at a distance up to seven inches , this ort of thing means a lot . Male mice are generally unimpressed by he urine markings of a subordinate , but they steer clear of areas : larked by a dominant mouse . Females , on the other hand , hang round areas marked by a dominant male . Researchers now regard small , hierarchical groups with a despot like Bill at the top as the typical social organization for nice . Indeed , within Crowcroft 's room , several such groups occupied and defended small territories , separated by a no-man's-land . These little mouse autocracies do not have vast territorial ambiions ; mice are , if anything , contractionists rather than expansionists . If food is readily available , they may confine their novements , after an exploratory stage , to an area of a few square neters . Haystacks , even side by side , typically harbor separate and isolated groups . In western Canada , distinct populations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in England , a researcher found fifteen separate house mouse coinnunities on one farm . However small it may be , the territory puts its mark on the mice . They travel their home range continually and come to know their routes not just by sight or smell , but internally ( or kinestheti ? ally ) as a sequence of muscle movements ; they will , at first , jump over an obstacle even after it has been removed . The whole group defends its borders with a ferocity seldom seen in their internal squabbles . When a dominant male is absent , pregnant females will savagely defend the group 's territory . Yet juveniles and females can freely cross into another group 's territory ( they lack an aggression-eliciting factor found in the urine of adult males ) , while an adult male trying to join a neighboring group risks death . ( He is unwelcome for good reason . The usurper mates with females in the group , and ejaculation stimulates him to kill their 98 What 's Nice ? Mice . infants . This infanticidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the time the male 's own offspring are due to be born . Then he becomes as nurturing as a lactating female . ) At first glance , none of this would suggest that the mouse ? this bickering homebody ? is well suited to colonizing new worlds . What makes it even more improbable is that mice combine isolation with inbreeding , and somehow parlay this apparent recipe for feeblemindedness and debilitation into an evolutionary advantage . Because the dominant mouse in a group does most of the mating , and then mates even more frequently with his female offspring , his genetic traits spread through the population . This process quickly results in neighboring communities of mice that are as distinct genetically as two human tribes . With multiple tribes on a single farm ( or , though one does not like to think it , in ? single house ) , some are bound to display advantageous traits . They may be able to survive catastrophic cold , or elude a better mousetrap , or grow fat and sleek on a new and short-lived food source . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , appears to have a genetic basis , and in the relatively short time house mice have lived in North America , genetic variability has enabled them to adapt that behavior to suit different living conditions : When raised in an identical environment , the offspring of Maine mice consistently use more cotton in their nests than do the offspring of Floridians . Paul K. Anderson of the University of Calgary has referred to this adaptiveness as " evolutionary serendipity . " No matter what the tune , no matter if the orchestra strikes up a waltz or a jig , a minuet or a tango , there is probably a mouse somewhere who can dance to it . Mice also of course reproduce at allegro speed . Females normally give birth for the first time at six to eight weeks of age , and every four weeks thereafter . By one researcher 's estimate , a pair of mice producing six pups per litter , and with successive generations doing likewise , would yield 2,688 living animals at the end // of six months . ( Fortunately , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboratory . ) It appears that their fecundity confuses even the mice themselves . Females may nurse the young of other females ; even immature animals that have never given birth sometimes get stimulated into lactation and join the group effort . One can imagine the original couple overwhelmed with progeny , like octogenarian humans proud but also a little horrified to see all their grandchildren and greatgrandchildren assembled in one place . Sooner or later , somebody ? everybody ? had better move out . And this is in fact what happens . In a study of feral house mice living on Great Gull Island off the Connecticut coast , Anderson estimated that three-quarters of all offspring become colonizers . Sheer numbers ? combined with limited opportunity in the hierarchical social world of their home territory ? drive young and subordinate mice out into the world . Because neighboring groups are closed to males , they seek new territories of their own ? to which genetic variability may leave them uniquely predisposed ? and try to establish new communities . And thus do mice make the world their dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house mice , is also the point on which it ceases to be a cute little critter and slides inexorably into the realm of vermin . Mouse reproduction is a daunting phenomenon even for the members of the American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association . You get a sense of this from the perfunctory names they give their prize specimens : AJA , ASTA , ABBA . The imagination plainly balks at the task of naming even the pick of the litter . And as for the runts . . . Among those at the Orange County Fairgrounds who uphold the slogan " What 's Nice ? Rats and Mice ! " there seem to be a disproportionate number of herpetologists . There are even mouse entrepreneurs , who sell what are I00 What 's Nice ? Mice . termed " feeder " mice to zoos . Among the mere amateurs , sixteenyear-old Molly Nicander from Riverside keeps two snakes , both of which deeply enjoy the company of feeder mice . She looks for " two of the ugliest males around " ( females being more valuable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cage and runs away . Even Debbie Prosser , the sympathetic show judge , keeps a king snake and feeds it what she calls " pinkies . " If a breeder of champion golden retrievers were to admit hurling live pups over the fence to her pet tiger , she would doubtless be drummed out of the American Kennel Club . But for mousers , who have come to accept Blitzkrieg reproduction as the rule , a handy snake is simply a way of mimicking the balance of nature . For people who do n't fancy mice , snakes are probably not a very good solution to rampant reproduction , at least not in the house . Indeed , there does n't seem to be a really good solution , and this begins to suggest the problem people have with mice . Partly it is a matter of cultural or psychological trespass : Mice cross the lawns and fences we diligently maintain as barriers against the natural world . They infiltrate our homes furtively and without invitation . We come to know them only as phantoms ? a pattering of footsteps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand revolutions in a single night ) , a scattering of droppings under the kitchen sink ( a single mouse voids fifty or more droppings daily and can spread salmonellosis ) , a blur of movement just off to one side of the hearth ( that kinesthetic sense means mice know nooks and crannies of the house that we can hardly imagine , and it also means they can vanish before the hurled book has come to earth or the word " mouse " has been uttered ) . We begin to get an unsettling sense that mice have made us their dominion . And it 's never just one mouse . No , the reproductive possibilities are nightmarish . Consider the phenomenon of mouse plagues . For reasons no one understands , mice have at times descended on communities , or welled up from within communities , in truly // horrific numbers . Witnesses to a spectacular Australian plague in 1917 reported that 544 tons of house mice were caught in just one town . In Kern County , California , in 1926 , an estimated four billion mice ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles in diameter over four months , far too many mice for even a very playful cat . But since there seems to be precious little we can do about mice , perhaps we should try to think of them finally in a more benign context . The truth is that mouse plagues are rare . And considering their ubiquity and the potential for destruction , mice really do relatively little damage . They offend our sensibilities more than our pocketbooks . If one searches high and low , and in and out of years , it is even possible to find an instance on record of mice actually benefiting humans . Each autumn in eastern Europe , so-called spike , or mound , mice , which are a species closely related to house mice , prepare for winter by constructing mounds of earth in the fields . Each mound has a core of pure grain , up to fifteen pounds of corn , millet , or barley gleanings left behind by farmers . The mice are assiduous not only about gathering grain , but about protecting it . They steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three labyrinthine entry passages , until the first snowfall socks them in . It has occurred to farmers that these grain hoards might feed livestock as well as mice , and so they raid the mouse pantry . " Ukrainian farmers do not shy from driving their wagons into the fields in the fall to collect the contents of the hills , " wrote Austrian researcher Antal Festetics , in 1961 . The farmers have doubtless inured themselves to wreaking havoc on mice . They are not known to write poems of regret or to utter the Ukrainian equivalent of Burns 's lament that the evicted mice will have " to thole the winter 's sleety dribble , An ' cranreuch cauld ! " Still , it is possible to infer that they are not completely heartless toward their rodent benefactors . " It is said , " Festetics wrote , " that if the winter stor-102 What 's Nice ? Mice . ages of the mice are destroyed early enough , they will build new ones . " Alas , it remains unclear whether the purpose of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for next year 's gleaning , or merely to accomplish a double gleaning of this year 's crop , and to hell with the mice . If we can suppress the primordial urge to cry " eek ! " a moment longer , it is even arguable that the house mouse has done good ? or , anyway , not much harm ? in a larger ecological sense . First , it seems to have conquered the world without causing the extinction of any other species . Unlike the notorious rabbit , for instance , it does not bully its competitors out of their niches or wipe out their food supply with its voracious nibbling . It has merely been adept at filling vacancies ? most often vacancies that humans have created . Second , the house mouse has unintentionally provided food not just for Ukrainian livestock , but for innumerable other creatures , notably snakes , weasels , skunks , foxes , hawks , crows , barn owls , and house cats , all of whom doubtless agree that mice are nice . Let us return then to our original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individually , it is , as the naturalist GeorgesLouis Buffon wrote , " a beautiful creature ; its skin sleek and soft ; its eyes bright and lively ; all its limbs . . . formed with exquisite delicacy . " And it is also , as Burns wrote , " our poor , earth-born companion , " its life inextricably tied up with ours , equaling our success as a species , but not our destructiveness . So do we clap ? I say we give the house mouse a standing ovation ? and just for a moment suppress the endless , irresistible urge to stomp the little huggers out underfoot , once and for all . 103 Cormorant Heaven On a winter afternoon in the flat , wet landscape of the Mississippi Delta , it is a common sight these days to see an untidy string of ten or twenty cormorants thrashing across the gray horizon . As they head west , the cormorants link up with another string coming in from their feeding grounds , and then another , until , as they pass overhead , they form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds . At their roost , which may be thirty miles away , as many as five thousand cormorants will fly in for the night . In the bare branches of a tupelo-and-cypress swamp , they perch fifty to sixty in every tree for hundreds of yards around , and they keep coming until dark , as if a painter were spattering India ink over and over across the treetops . In the Delta , as in much of North America , cormorants were uncommon as little as ten years ago . But in the early 1970s , the bird began an extraordinary recovery from the effects of pesticides and human persecution , and it is now rapidly reclaiming its old range . This has caused little joy and lots of hostile muttering from San Diego to the Chesapeake Bay . 104 Cormorant Heaven Human antipathy toward cormorants dates back at least to Deuteronomy , which declared them unclean , and this ancient , almost pathological , ill will has revived among fishermen and fish farmers everywhere , but especially in the Mississippi Delta . Progressive farmers there began kissing cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckshot clay to create 110,000 acres of high-profit catfish ponds . On their annual migration from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast , cormorants spotted these rich new wetlands and promptly reappraised their vacation plans . A new destination was born : The Delta had become the catfishfarming capital of the world just in time to become the cormorant capital , too . On any winter evening , forty thousand cormorants now return to roosts around the Delta . Traveling with them , in cargo , are perhaps thirty thousand pounds of catfish , which might be worth $23,000 wholesale were they not already in advanced stages of digestion . It is a thought to stir feelings of profound theological turmoil in a catfish farmer 's belly . " It 's horrible , " says one . " There ai n't nothing good about ' em . I 'm sure God put ' em here for something , but I do n't know what it is . " Shoot . What any former cotton farmer knows in his heart is that God put cormorants here to take the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you who have n't had the pleasure , is a large black waterbird resembling a cross between a crow and an eel . Its name literally means " crow of the sea , " and it is a member of the pelican order . But while a pelican flies with a kind of gliding grace , neck folded back , the cormorant is all get-ahead motion . It hurtles along with neck out , head slightly up , and wings constantly flapping , clocking fifty miles an hour at times , but somehow looking as if it must struggle just to stay airborne . The cormorant moves more gracefully underwater than in the air , which is the main reason people in the Delta do n't much like A catfish farmer will be out tending one of his ponds when a ock of cormorants will splash down two ponds over and float r a few minutes . As the mood arises , the birds lift their wings to 105 shake the air out of their feathers . Then , one by one , they disappear underwater , apparently using the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of diver 's weight belt . The birds ' feathers are interwoven much more loosely than in other waterfowl , making the cormorant more " wettable " and less buoyant . It swims underwater with its wings folded along its slender body , its long , sinuous neck curving inquisitively from side to side , and its large eyes alert behind clear inner lids , like the nictitating membranes in certain reptiles . A swimming cormorant is a bit like Daffy Duck in goggles . Simultaneous thrusts of its webbed feet provide enough propulsion for a cormorant to tailgate a fish and catch it crosswise in its hooked bill . It can catch fish even at a depth of eighty feet , staying under for as long as a minute . By comparison , a short dip in a sixfoot-deep pond boiling with , say , 175,000 catfish is as easy as Chinese takeout . The cormorant generally brings a fish to the surface after ten to twenty seconds and flips it in the air to position it correctly and smooth down its spines . Sometimes a flock of cormorants will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they take wing again with full gullets and move two or three ponds far-106 Cormorant Heaven ther along just about the time the farmhands arrive at the first pond with their shotguns , pyrotechnic " bird bangers " and all the other futile instruments of anticormorant outrage . Even without this catfish cafeteria , the cormorant is wily enough to get by on about a half-hour of honest work per day , if one can properly apply that term to what is , after all , fishing . Otherwise , cormorants mostly loaf . You can see them hanging around on rivers , lakes , and harbors almost anywhere in the world . Their appearance always suggests something other than cormorants . Hence such common nicknames as " water turkey , " " crow duck , " and even " shark . " On the water , they ride low , with only their necks and heads visible , like submarines with their periscopes up or miniature Loch Ness monsters . On rocks or pilings , they like to perch upright with their scraggly wings spread out to dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more cormorant species sprout feathery crests . The most common of these in North America is known as the double-crested cormorant , though for much of the year its head is as smooth and slicked-back as a tango dancer 's . This combination of mutability with a netherworldly appearance has sometimes evoked images of the devil . In Paradise Lost , for example , John Milton wrote that Satan " sat like a cormorant " on the Tree of Life , preparing to work mischief in the Garden of Eden . It is almost enough to make the catfish farmers of Mississippi Attempt exorcism . They have tried everything else . A couple of seasons back , for example , a **25;863;TOOLONG enthusiast named Cooper Kimbrell spent several mornings waging a small-scale Battle of Britain over a catfish farm . Kimbrell is happy to re-create that moment in history for a visitor . He stands with the tail of his aircraft restrained between his ankles as the engine whines up to full speed . On the fuselage , a painted " storm lizard " extends a forked tongue and appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane , it climbs rapidly , and he puts it through // loops and snap rolls , and then sends it screaming down like a dive-bomber . " A bird hears that coming at him , " he says , " he turns and runs the other way . " To try out the technique for local fish farmers , Kimbrell and a couple of fellow hobbyists positioned themselves on the dirt levees dividing the catfish ponds and waited for a squadron of cormorants to approach from its night roost . When birds began to peel off for a descent , Kimbrell 's plane went up to meet them : " I pointed it straight up and held it there and went straight up through them and just hoped that I was the one that came out on top . " As the cormorants broke right and left , he pursued them , and here Kimbrell sounds like a Spitfire pilot recounting a dogfight : " You had to concentrate at things you were n't sure you could do , and you just did ' em . You found you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird 's tail close enough that the cormorant craned its head back in mid-flight to see what was chasing it , then folded its wings and plunged underwater from fifteen feet up . The catfish farmers thought it was the best show they had seen in years . In the cold light of dawn they also realized that aerial warfare would cost money , not just for wages , but for the planes , which one agricultural extension agent describes as " expensive little buggers . " In a Louisiana trial a plane hit a cormorant , more or less accidentally . The bird lived . The plane did n't . Most farms now rely on less entertaining methods . Butane cannons boom at intervals across the ponds ? and also provide perches for cormorants , which are smart enough to know they are firing blanks . On some farms a jack-in-the-box scarecrow , called " man-in-a-cannon , " leaps out of a fifty-five-gallon drum with an ineffectual bang . Other farms have experimented with a device called " air crow , " which deploys revolving strobe lights and inflatable plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people shouting , shotguns firing , and birds screaming at a reported volume of 130 decibels . But a cormorant can get used to almost anything . Killing them has of course occurred to one or two fish farm-108 Cormorant Heaven ers in bleak moments of aquacultural despair . But cormorants have been afforded federal protection under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act since 1972 . In some cases , the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service ( USFWS ) will issue a permit allowing a farmer to kill up to two hundred or so birds a year , with the idea of making the air crows and other instruments of harassment more credible to discerning cormorants . But the paperwork is onerous , and farmers protest ? perhaps too much ? that killing cormorants is n't easy . They fly away if people get close , and at a distance , especially on the water surface , they make meager targets . " They 're tough birds , " a farmer says . " Nothing to ' em but bones . There 's nothing to kill . " That is not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish farm with a fifty-bird permit of illegally killing fifteen thousand birds over five years , including herons as well as cormorants . Minimum-wage field hands , ill equipped to distinguish between a water turkey and a bald eagle , apparently blazed away at anything with wings , even hawks and ducks that do n't consume fish . The result is that battle lines are beginning to form . With aquaculture expanding and natural wetlands dwindling because of development , fish farms can become a magnet for an area 's entire population of some waterfowl species . Because of the risk to these birds , federal officials are reluctant to issue special cormorantkilling permits . Angry fish farmers , who are by and large wealthy business people , have turned to Congress for help . One result is that researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's controversial Animal Damage Control unit , best known for killing coyotes to benefit western ranchers , have recently moved into the Delta to contemplate the cormorant . Fish farmers do n't talk about what they hope will result , except that it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction . " Privately they are pushing for a standard depredation order , which would allow liberalized killing of cormorants even on open waters . To make this politically more palatable , they are I09 EVERY CREEPING THING trying to convince people that the country is being overrun by cormorants . This is , of course , merely God 's honest truth to a catfish farmer who did not even see his first cormorant until seven years ago but recently had sixteen thousand of them roosting in sight of his ponds , or to one Texas shrimp farmer whose cormorant losses were estimated at $25,000 a week " till he drained the dagblamed ponds . " They see themselves under siege . " Y'all give us a break , " an equipment supplier calls out when he spots a reporter doing interviews at a catfish restaurant in Belzoni , Mississippi . " We ai n't trying to destroy them . They 're trying to destroy us . " This is a venerable sentiment among fishermen , who have fumed for centuries over the cormorant 's ability to go underwater and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Idle minds have often leapt to the conclusion that the cormorants were taking all the fish . From there it was another small leap to the misguided idea of conserving game by killing cormorants . As in the case of bats , killing cormorants was particularly easy because of ingrained human prejudice against them . Not only does the cormorant resemble the devil , but its gullet is large and its purported greed is legendary . Though the typical adult stands just three feet tall , cormorants have been known to take fish of up to sixteen inches in length or to contain as many as eight smaller fish at a time , in various stages of digestion . Chaucer considered them synonymous with gluttony , and Shakespeare described Time , that devourer of life , as a cormorant . Usurers were once " money-cormorants , " and the bird itself has in places been nicknamed " lawyer , " presumably because of its alleged avarice . These unsavory cultural associations persisted into the 1970s , when a faction of Cambodia 's genocidal Khmer Rouge revolutionaries became known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response of fishermen to the apparent competition from cormorants was to domesticate them and work them like prized retrievers , using a hemp or leather collar to keep the birds from swallowing their catch . The usual West-110 Cormorant Heaven ern response , on the other hand , was mayhem . Queen Elizabeth I authorized a bounty on cormorants and other " ravening birds and vermin . " In the United States , fishermen placed leg-hold traps on perching sites and visited nesting colonies in the summer to drop large rocks on the eggs . On top of this persecution , widespread use of the pesticide DDT caused cormorant eggshells to become so thin that they crumbled under the brooding parent 's own feet . In Wisconsin , where huge flocks once nested , only sixty-six breeding pairs remained by 1972 . The most peculiar thing about the long persecution of cormorants is that there appears to have been hardly any reason for it . Over the past century , more than 125 scientific papers have examined the cormorant 's dietary predilections . They indicate that in normal circumstances , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest ? alewives , for example , in the Great Lakes . It also preys on suckers , sticklebacks , ling , sculpin , and other species that eat the spawn of commercially valuable fish . So in theory , the cormorant 's choice of food may actually benefit humans . But sportsmen tend to believe what they think they see with their own eyes . For example , near Watertown , New York , on Lake Ontario , more than eight thousand cormorant breeding pairs now nest on Little Galloo Island . Local fishing guides have accused the birds of eating trout , bass , and salmon fingerlings stocked by the state . A simple solution proposed by biologists was to stock fingerlings at night , when cormorants do n't fish , to give them a chance to disperse . But even this proved unnecessary on more careful consideration : The fish found liberally strewn around nests on Little Galloo almost always turned out to be alewives , not salmon or trout . The guides have nonetheless petitioned for an open season on cormorants , so far unsuccessfully . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore on Little Galloo with shotguns and slaughtered almost 1,000 cormorants , most of them fledglings still in the nest . Federal officials called it an act of " environmental EVERY CREEPING THING terrorism . " But local fishermen likened the incident to the Boston Tea Party , as a blow for their freedom . The one place where humans have a legitimate gripe against cormorants is where we have ourselves created an unnatural concentration of fish . Cormorants , always opportunists , are old hands at this sort of thing . In the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu , California , a painting by Vittore Carpaccio from 1495 depicts fishing enclosures on a Venetian lagoon . Cormorants are everywhere ? ducking underwater , floating with only their heads and necks visible , perching on the fishermen 's fences . Seven boats patrol the waters , and in the bow of each boat an archer fires pellets at the birds . What seems to be going on here is a fifteenthcentury version of predator control ? and for the same reason as in the Mississippi Delta : Cormorants can pose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have examined the stomach contents of 136 cormorants in the fish farms of the Mississippi Delta and found that 64 percent of their diet consisted of catfish . The fish farmers themselves estimated their direct losses at $3 million a year , plus $2.1 million for butane cannons and the like . Losses from other factors can be at least as bad . Indeed according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture 's own statistics , 70 percent of catfish losses nationally are due to disease and another 10 percent to oxygen depletion ; birds account for only 7 percent of the total . But none of these threats is so damnably visible as the cormorant , nor so well suited for an angry letter to one 's congressperson . Moreover , there is something inwardly rankling about the knowledge that the cormorant problem is getting worse at least in part because of the fish farmers themselves . A full winter of rich southern food is surely one reason why cormorants nesting in the Great Lakes are now showing population increases of 15 to 63 percent a year . " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catfish farmers concedes . " They head North with a half-inch of fat on them , and all four eggs hatch , and then ? here they come again . " 112 Cormorant Heaven On Little Gull Island at the mouth of Wisconsin 's vast Green Bay , seven hundred pairs of cormorants now nest each summer . The nests are whitened platforms of interwoven branches , clustered together everywhere on the rocks and in the trees . Having been reoccupied and continually improved over the years , some stand a hoot tall , or more . The males move in first each spring and sing seductively to every passing female . Researchers have unkindly likened the cormorant 's oak-oak-oak love song to the sound of human belching or to " the series of choking sounds sometimes made by a cat , but ... more rapid . " Cormorants nonetheless have twice the breeding rate of other waterfowl . Moreover , they form affectionate couples , with the male frequently bringing the female gifts of fresh nesting material , and with both parents sharing chicktearing duties . Human or other intrusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young vulnerable to heat , vandalm , or predation by the herring gulls that commonly share the esting site . Otherwise , they are devoted and attentive parents . When people try to describe cormorants , the words " primitive " or " reptilian " often come to mind , and a cormorant nesting site looks much as one would imagine a dinosaur breeding colony . ; nano has whitewashed the rocks , and the phosphoric acid in it as killed the vegetation and turned the trees where some birds perch into ruined hulks . Cormorants old enough to leave the nest stand together in large groups , each of them like an upright , elongated " S " written in heavy ink across a bleached-out wasteland . The short , underdeveloped-looking wings and the shape of the skull suggest Archaeopteryx , the putative link between dinosaurs and birds . To pull itself up out of a crevice , a cormorant uses its wings , its scaly reptilian feet , and finally , its hooked bill to find a purchase and clamber up onto the rock surface . It is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or as if the cormorant were a creature in metamorphosis. // Younger birds still confined to the nest rear up when a human approaches and squeal aaah-aaah-aaah , with their pinkish yellow mouths gaping in fear . Gular sacs , fleshy evaporative cooling devices at the top of the throat , flutter , and their heads waggle anxiously as if to say , " No-no-no , not me , not me . " Several nests contain featherless hatchlings only a few days old ; the bones move visibly beneath their leathery black skin . The human intruder today is a population ecologist named Jim Ludwig , who is president of the Michigan Audubon Society and also of his own firm , Ecological Research Services , in Ann Arbor . Ludwig is a burly fiftyish man with a jutting jaw and blue eyes behind thick , smoke-colored bifocals . He wears a T-shirt and stained blue jeans , and his forearms are so cut up from handling cormorants that when he recently tried to obtain hypodermic needles to take blood samples , the nurse mistook him for a junkie . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for the first ten years he did not see a single nesting cormorant . By the early 1990s he was visiting twenty-eight cormorant nesting colonies in the same territory each summer , logging seventy-five hundred miles in his battered research boat . On Little Gull , Ludwig approaches a group of five- and sixweek-old birds , and then suddenly bounds in among them , grabbing four by the neck and carrying them out , limp as dead turkeys . He sits down on the rocks and tucks the birds under his legs , talking to them gently . Then he wraps a towel around one bird 's head , stretches out its wings , and lays it on its back across his lap so an assistant can take a blood sample . Afterward , the bird shakes itself and stumbles off even more awkwardly than usual . While the cormorant 's reproductive prowess may be daunting for fish farmers , Ludwig believes it makes the species an ideal earlywarning system for environmental hazards , a kind of canary-inthe-mineshaft for the entire Great Lakes . What Ludwig and a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perverse answer to the Mississippi- catfish farmer 's question about " what God put ' em here for , " or to its 114 Cormorant Heaven inevitable secular corollary , " What use are they to humans , anyway ? " One tentative answer is that research on the booming cormorant population may prevent human suffering ? particularly among people who eat fish ? and spare us from human stupidity . Unfortunately , if the research findings turn out to be correct , they could also produce an economic impact that will make the catfish farmers ' woes dwindle into nothingness . Standing on Little Gull Island , Ludwig likens the Great Lakes , which contain 20 percent of the world 's fresh water , to a huge bathtub with no outlet . It takes Green Bay alone fifteen years to achieve a single change of water , he says . What goes into the water stays there , accumulating in the flesh of fish and ultimately in the people or cormorants that eat the fish . What went into the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lubricants , heat-transfer fluids , and about three hundred other products . Most government monitoring programs now show the total PCB burden in the Great Lakes to be declining as a result of a 1976 ban on such compounds , which were found to be carcinogenic . But Ludwig calls the reassurance false . " We believe U.S. state and federal regulatory agencies have measured generally the wrong things with the wrong techniques , and failed to look at the real world to ascertain if fewer biological effects have occurred in step with reduced contamination as measured by totals . " Waterbirds can concentrate toxic residues at twenty-five million times the levels present in the water , and Ludwig routinely finds PCBs in his cormorant blood samples . Moreover , he believes that the decline in the total PCB level in the lakes may disguise increased proportions of the PCBs that are most toxic for cormorants and humans . The booming cormorant population provides a means of quantifying the effects of this change , and what Ludwig is learning is that reproductive defects and deformities are increasing . Crouching by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs , Ludwig cracks them one by one and examines their contents . Most are infertile , but after three eggs he cradles an underdeveloped // embryo in his fingers : " Twenty-five days , " he says . " Severe head and neck edema . Let 's jar this one . This is one of the PCB- or dioxin-like symptoms we 're seeing . " In three of the dozen eggs , the embryos have these swollen , goiterous necks . Ludwig notes that detecting such a phenomenon in mammals would be difficult , since defective embryos tend to be absorbed into the lining of the uterus or aborted and lost . Because cormorants develop so rapidly after hatching , they also display growth abnormalities more noticeably than do mammals . On a single visit to Little Gull in 1990 , Ludwig found seven hatchlings with crossed bills , four with eye defects , and a couple with leg deformities . Other researchers from the United States and Canada have corroborated Ludwig 's findings of reproductive impairments in cormorants and other species , including bald eagles and trout . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mink and otters have stopped reproducing altogether along much of the Great Lakes shoreline . Other studies in humans show that women who have consumed PCB-laden fish from Lake Michigan give birth to children with smaller head size and poorer neuromuscular development . Public health departments advise against eating Great Lakes fish regularly , if at all . But no government agency has yet followed Ludwig in making the leap from cormorants to humans and concluding that reproductive problems are getting worse because of PCBs . " The implication of declaring that this is what 's going on , " says one scientist , would be to necessitate " a multibillion-dollar cleanup . " It would be a lovely , if bittersweet , turnabout were such a cleanup to become a moral necessity because of what researchers can see happening in cormorants . The bird might then be transformed in the convoluted human mind from agent of the devil to environmental archangel . But this is surely wishful thinking . A bird that enlightens society about a problem ? one for which the enormous costs of a solution are far easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always going to seem more like a headache than a hero . 116 Cormorant Heaven What we can extract from the cormorant 's strange tale , then , is merely a lesson in how complex nature can be , how difficult it is to characterize its changing manifestations as " good " or " bad , " and how cautious we should be about the urge to tamper with it . There are unforeseen consequences in everything we do . For the catfish farmers , who are in any case unlikely to win approval to kill large numbers of cormorants , it may still be possible to obtain a measure of peace . Rather than beseeching Uncle Sam for relief , it may prove less troublesome in the end for them to sit back and shrewdly consider their adversary , and then adapt their own methods accordingly . Cormorants are not great aerialists , for example . They need room to land and even more room to take off . With its wings flapping a cormorant may run along the surface of a catfish pond for thirty to forty yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes airborne . Putting a net across a pond to keep cormorants out costs too much ? $22,000 for a twenty-acre pond , in one estimate . So researchers at Texas A &; M University dug long , narrow ponds , and then strung black twine across them at thirty-foot intervals , perpendicular to the prevailing winds . For a total cost of $13 an acre , they found they could play havoc with cormorant flight patterns and save catfish for harvest . This elegant solution may not come as great news to a farmer who has just invested huge sums to dig five hundred acres worth of big blocky catfish ponds laid out like cormorant runways . But there is another alternative : He can work on improving his harassment methods and learn to swallow his cormorant losses as just another cost of doing business , like disease or oxygen depletion . Relief may not come immediately , but it will come . Eagles , owls , or some other predators will move in on the cormorants ? or the alewife population in the Great Lakes will nosedive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as did DDT . One way or another , the booming cormorant population will go bust . Unlike the devil , cormorants are not eternal . Or as a wildlife agent puts it , a tad ruefully , " Did n't there used to be something called the balance of nature ? " 117 Acting Like Animals It is 8:00 A.M. on a hot January day in Hollywood . On stage five at Raleigh Studios , a film crew is adjusting lights , checking cameras , rigging props . The star of the commercial to be filmed today stands in a darkened corner , naked except for the grip 's tape wrapped protectively around his feet . In person he is surprisingly short , like so many film stars ; counting the tape , he stands just fifty-eight inches tall . His main lady has stayed at home this morning with their firstborn , but he is accompanied by a soothing stand-in girlfriend . Merrill ( a star in Hollywood needs no last name ) is also surrounded by a small army of retainers . Four of them are now spraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n Tips . He will require 120 cans of the stuff over the course of the day . Merrill , whose natural coloring is white with auburn spots , endures the tedious business of makeup about as well as any veteran actor . He has been through it all before , playing the part for which he was born : longhorn bull . He helped win 118 Acting Like Animals a Clio ( the advertising Oscar ) with his performance as the bull in the china shop . Today he will play the role of the bull on the chessboard , masterminding the Sicilian defense . He is a pro . An executive from Merrill Lynch , the brokerage house that is paying for today 's shooting , studies the clouds of spray forming a brown halo around the firm 's namesake and corporate symbol . " In the all-American tradition , the star 's hair is dyed , " he says , to put the scene in context . He thinks about the rightness of that for a moment , and then adds , " At least he is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act , almost anything is possible : a pony that will pose as a green unicorn , a cockatoo that will imitate a windshield wiper , even a dog ( if not a fifteen-hundredpound longhorn bull ) in drag . Show business trainers say they will never take a job that pains or endangers an animal ( aesthetic pain is , of course , a separate issue ) . They also can not overcome anatomical limitations . Trainer Hubert Wells once got a script in which a seal was supposed to stand on its hind flippers and stroll down the sidewalk eating an ice-cream cone , a notion roughly like asking a ballerina to dance Swan Lake on her tongue . Otherwise , for every imaginable role , for any stunt , there is a suitable animal ? and probably also an understudy and several rivals ? all within an hour 's drive of Hollywood . The services of this diverse community are regularly in demand , for a reason both Hollywood and Madison Avenue understand in their souls : Animal actors , running the emotional gamut from A ( for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have always been top dog at the box office . " Is the bull ready ? " says a voice from behind the camera . Tom Mitchell , Merrill 's main handler , nods and leads the animal by a halter out onto the enormous chessboard that is the set // for today 's commercial . Merrill promptly takes up his first position , off-center on the black king 's side of the board . Mitchell eases the halter off . He and Danny , another wrangler , loop a piece of hundred-pound-test monofilament that looks like dental floss around each horn to steady the bull as they slowly back off the chessboard . The camera starts to whir , and Merrill picks up his head , instinctively working to it . " We 're rolling now , " says the voice . The wranglers nod and draw the monofilament off the bull and out of the picture . " Okay , " someone announces sternly , " the bull is loose . " The most basic skill for a Hollywood trainer is the ability to read an animal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before anybody gets maimed . The task is more difficult than it might seem , because the animals must routinely share the set with human actors who know little about them , and who may like them even less . " Never work with kids and animals , " W. C. Fields 120 Acting Like Animals is reputed to have said . " They 'll steal your best scene with their behinds to the camera . " The task is further complicated because animal actors , like human ones , sometimes learn to disconnect outward behavior from real gut feelings . Hubert Wells has trained wolves to snarl on command and , in the next instant , to nuzzle him for their food reward ? an extremely unnatural transition . Trainer Monty Cox teaches big jungle cats to mute their killer instincts even as they knock him to the ground with claws out and fangs bared . The trick is to recognize when feigned anger becomes genuine and when the tiger starts stalking for real . Cox , interviewed during a practice session with a sixteenmonth-old tiger , says it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discern anger or fatigue in its body position or the look in its eye . Then , having reassured his small audience , he launches into an extensive round of amputee jokes . On stage five at Raleigh Studios something is not quite right . Merrill drops his head and steps forward . " Watch it ! " someone shouts , but the film crew is already scattering . Merrill comes off the chessboard at a lope and is rolling by the time he passes between two wranglers , who try to lasso him unsuccessfully . The bull heads straight for the chair in which his owner , livestock trainer Joan Edwards , is sitting . She does not so much as miss a pull on her cigarette . Five feet in front of her , he turns , as she knows he will , and heads into the enclosure where his girlfriend is waiting . It is , say his handlers , just a case of the jitters . The pressure on the set is no less real for an animal actor than it is for a human one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give their working stars something to escape to . ( Odd instances of bonding abound , as between Marlon Brando and Wally Cox . Trainer Steve Martin of Working Wildlife has a leopard that is // never truly at peace except in the company of the malamute with which it was raised . ) In any case , Merrill regains his composure , and filming proceeds in earnest . Trainers go to extraordinary and imaginative lengths to get the performance they want from an animal . For Ring of Bright Water , Hubert Wells spent months training otters , which are about as sedentary as quicksilver , to go to a spot the size of a quarter and stand there for twenty seconds . Since close-ups in a movie rarely last longer than fifteen seconds , this was , he says , just long enough . The usual incentive for the animal is food . But David McKelvey , an animal consultant , sometimes employs his repertoire of about three hundred animal calls as a persuader . To train a rooster , he once imitated a hen in heat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , trainers sometimes devise a gimmick to trick the animal into doing what the script requires . Not long ago , a beer company wanted Joan Edwards to get a bull to jump through a seemingly solid brick wall ? a feat that goes against the animal 's instinct for selfpreservation . Edwards knew that bulls do n't like the dark ; they will move toward light . So she had the set designer build the wall with a dark , narrow eighteen-foot runway behind it . The only light came from holes between the artificial bricks . As a finishing touch , Edwards had a white strip painted across the bottom of the back side of the wall ; the appearance of a low obstacle would cause the bull to leap . In the resulting commercial , the bull ( an aggressive sort named Heckle ) practically flies through the wall . The trainers themselves sometimes become a kind of gimmick . Diane Brisby , of the Exotic Animal Training and Management Program at Moorpark College outside Los Angeles , raised a female cougar from the age of nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diane apparently went from mother figure to rival . Now , says Diane , if a scene calls for the cougar to have 122 Acting Like Animals fangs out and ears back , " All I have to do is say , Hi , Eve . ' " In the jargon of the trade , she has become Eve 's " hate person . " Like a court jester who has told the wrong joke , a hate person should not show up again on the set after provoking an animal to snarl . Diane , fingering her throat , says it is all very depressing . Like that other great slab of beefcake , Sly Stallone , Merrill is not at his finest in speaking parts . What he does best is simply look good , and today 's script plays to that talent . Merrill must rouse himself from his normal disposition , which is placid , bordering on torpid , only enough to project something like intelligence . The huge chess pieces around him ride on casters , with monofilament control wires being worked by stagehands off-camera ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn of his head , as if by telepathy . The trick is to get the right sequence of head turns and chess moves . At midafternoon , the crew is filming its umpteenth take of the fourth featured move ( all moves come from a classic match between the former Yugoslavia and the former USSR ) . " Tom , put his ass to the right , " says the voice from behind the camera . Mitchell nudges the bull over as the camera gets up to speed . " Now , Danny , get him to turn his head toward you . " Danny , off to the right , begins to slap the walls and shout , " Huh ! Huh ! Merrill ! Merrill ! " The bull is indifferent . Then Danny beats the floor , and Merrill executes a brilliant head turn . " Send the piece , " says the voice . White queen slides to queen 's knight one . Black rook moves in turn to king seven . " Now get him to look at you , Tommy . " Mitchell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the set , scuttles forward shaking a sheet of brown paper in one hand and rattling a galvanized bucket with a 7-Up can inside in the other . Merrill turns and looks at him . Depending on one 's reading of the bull , he is saying either , " Bobby Fischer // could n't have played it better " or " What in the Sam Hill are you doing down there , Tommy Mitchell ? " " Rock ' n ' roll ! " a stagehand whoops , not pausing to quibble about nuances . Says the voice behind the camera : " That 's a cut . " It is sometimes hard to tell if the world of animal actors is a parody or merely the epitome of the splendid follies of Tinseltown . Item : Until recently , the animals had their own Patsy Award instead of the Oscar . Frank Inn , a wealthy trainer who kept humble digs opposite D &; D Auto Parts and Salvage in Sun Valley , had a wall covered with forty Patsys . The plaques hung just across his dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won them . Item : The ranks of aspiring animal stars are sprinkled with shamelessly familiar names : snakes called Boa Derek and Julius Squeezer , a buffalo named Cicely Bison and a bird named Martha Rhea , even a ferret called Ferret FawcettMajors . Item : There is no Schwab 's drugstore for would-be Lana Turners of the quadruped variety , but Mac , an alley cat featured in Logan 's Run , was discovered in a garbage bin behind a McDonald 's franchise . The trainers of both Sandy ( last seen on Broadway in Annie ) and Morris the Cat ( sometimes known as " Mortz " but never , never , not even in Hollywood , as " Mo , baby " ) say they discovered their stars at death 's doorway in the pound . And the original Benji was a worn-out face card from the 1960s , a thirteen-year-old veteran of Petticoat Junction , when a producer spotted him and saw box-office gold . The rest is history . Item : In case the rest is not quite history , the leading animal actors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to the value of publicity . Benji 's slick promotional package quotes the New York Daily News : " Benji 's uncanny ability to project emotions definitely makes him the Laurence Olivier of the dog world . " Lassie , the real Olivier , is of course above this sort of thing . 124 Acting Like Animals On the set , the film crew is shooting a brief sequence without Merrill . Tom Mitchell sits in a corner with a device he has manufactured to make rude noises every time the voice behind the camera says " Action . " The bull is asleep . Outside , Joan Edwards is giving an interview to a television reporter . " What 's the hardest part for Merrill ? " the interviewer asks . Says Edwards , with a sympathetic nod for her flagging star : " I 'd have to say it 's the long days . " The world of animal actors is , finally , a business world . For the working stiffs , the money is not spectacular . An ND ( or nondescript ) horse is $35 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500 to $1,000 . But an animal who breaks through to stardom can write his own ticket , and that may be why the competition is so fierce . Benji , billed by his handlers as " the free world 's most huggable hero , " became an industry unto himself after his first film grossed $45 million . He has starred in three other films and four television specials . His name and image have been sold for T-shirts , sleeping bags , space suits , trash cans , and shoelaces . Updike and Mailer have publishers ; Benji has several " publishing licensees to promote his various books and book-related products . " He also recently licensed a Benji computer game . The corporation that controls his name calls this " a very exciting license with staggering exposure potential . " Finally , there are the personal appearances , or " exposure events , " around the nation . Benji keeps up a schedule that is busier than George Will 's and commands a speaker 's fee approaching that of Henry Kissinger . Mickey Rooney should be so cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top and still keep up standards . Lassie , who is by now a member of Hollywood 's Old Guard ( the current Lassie is the seventh in the line ) , manages to // combine fabulous wealth with a genial , dignified lifestyle . But lacking Lassie 's deeper hold on the public , most of the stars continue to hustle even at the top . Their trainers must constantly aim to do something different , to find some new twist to keep up box-office interest for another year ? even if this means that the animal must learn , in effect , to dance Swan Lake on its tongue . Thus a few years ago , Benji 's corporation decreed that he should become a scuba diver . A diving suit was manufactured at a cost of $10,000 , and Frank Inn began training the dog . They started out with the dog swimming on the surface , to get him used to the suit . Inn talked to him via hydrophone and " reinforced him " with pieces of steak fed through a cork in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then got the dog accustomed to working underwater . After several months the dog was ready , and filming began . It is tempting to imagine Benji standing on the bottom of the pool in his diving suit like Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate , contemplating the surreal expectations of all those mad people up there above the air bubbles . The problem with this analogy is that Benji was almost certainly glad to fulfill those expectations , because Benji will do anything for a piece of steak . Back home , where Benji has just been induced to climb a ladder backward and dive blindfolded into a pool from a high platform , Frank Inn says it all : " Is n't he amazing ? He 's never done that before . There 's nothing that dog wo n't do . " It is 11:00 P.M. on stage five at Raleigh Studios , and the crew is trying to get the final move of the game on film . " Can you get his head up , Tommy ? " says the voice from behind the camera . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head . The chess piece rolls . The head turns work . Someone says , " Back to position one , please . " But it is a cut , a take . They have it . Checkmate . The voice from behind the camera asks for a few close-ups ? head-on , right profile , left profile ? to be edited in as needed . 126 Acting Like Animals " O.K. , " the voice says finally at 11:21 . " Wrap the bull . " Nineteen days later , the finished commercial is broadcast nationwide during the Super Bowl . It runs thirty seconds , and is seen and admired by eighty-two million people . There is talk of another Clio . On his ranch north of Los Angeles , Merrill spends the day relaxing with friends but does not catch the game . 127 A Mouse Like a Spear One Sunday not long ago , at the height of the English autumn , I went out walking with a researcher named Carolyn King in Wytham Wood , on a hill overlooking the domes and spires of Oxford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singing Way , " once a pilgrim route to the convent of a Saxon holy woman . Ahead was Great Wood , where Oxford field researchers have been studying wildlife ecology for fifty years . Behind was Marley Wood , where King did her doctoral research on the secret lives of weasels . The scene felt like of one of those classic animal tales of the English countryside . King , a slim , forward-leaning woman in her fifties , with an amiable grin turning up the right corner of her mouth , pointed out the badger paths crossing our trail and the places where she tried to figure out , with the help of live traps , what the weasels were up to as they darted about " like small bolts of brown lightning . " She indicated the rusty bracken on either side of the trail , the rodent holes among the roots , and the gnarled and regal old oaks overhead . " I love the thought of the animals living their private 128 A Mouse Like a Spear lives under all this stuff , and occasionally we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The questions King asked , first at Oxford , and later as a researcher and instructor at Waikato University in New Zealand , had to do with what the weasels were eating , where they traveled , and how they managed to survive in a cold and hostile world despite having short fur , little fat , and the metabolism of a hiphop dancer on a caffeine bender . " It 's just too bad we have to trap them to answer the questions , " said King , who was back at Oxford on a yearlong sabbatical . " I used to fantasize about learning their language and sending a message around with the robins , and they would all gather together and say , Look , we 've got a few questions to answer . ' But then I do n't know how you would write a thesis on the basis of that methodology . " The late afternoon sun cast long shadows , and it occurred to me that there was only one problem with the animal-tale character of the day : In most traditional stories , King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " bloodthirsty villains " laying waste to " the poor faithful creatures " of Toad Hall in Kenneth Grahame 's The Wind in the Willows , for instance , or cutthroat soldiers in " the weasel army of Feragho the Assassin " in Salamandastron , a novel in the Redwall series by British writer Brian Jacques . " There is something enormously satisfactory about a weasel , " King writes , in her own book , The Natural History of Weasels and Stoats . But you would not have a clue what she means from our popular culture . Human references to weasels are commonplace and almost never flattering , not when Washington Irving wrote about a " meagre , weasel-faced Frenchman " nor when David Letterman imagined George Washington 's secret opinion that Ben Franklin was " a fat kite-flying weasel . " Weasels are too quick for most people ever to have seen one in the wild , and zoos rarely display them . Yet they have entered our language as emblems of conniving dishonesty ( all publishers are " thieving weasels , " according to radio personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most recent major league baseball strike were " self-deluding weasels taking advantage of another man 's suffering , " said an ESPN announcer ) , and cowardice ( " gutless weasels " has become a standard epithet , and Calvin , the cartoon hero , once told his friend Hobbes that the middle ground is for " sissy weasels " ) . The weasel and the stoat ( a variety of weasel common in the British Isles ) were once associated with the gentry . Their fur , which turns white in winter and is known as ermine , provided the luxurious trim for courtly robes . But even this only brought the weasel death , not glory ; King quotes a bit of " anonymous doggerel " suggesting that it was entirely appropriate for the ermine ( " rhymes with vermin " ) , " a bloodthirsty , vicious detestable crook , " to adorn " the judge , the dowager , the duke . " Nowadays , the ermine trade is much reduced in scale . But " weasel " lives on as a synonym for that subspecies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a whole host of smarmy tassel-shoe traits ( as when the Washington Post recently wrote about " gutless vacillating network weasels " ) . Carolyn King calls such slurs " character assassination . " When we link weasels with politicians , producers , and the like , she says , we do a terrible injustice to the weasels . " They are beautiful animals , and I get quietly annoyed when people malign them . But there 's no point in saying anything . It 's a cultural icon . Human traits get projected onto an animal for no reason , the same way people think of foxes as cunning or owls as wise . " And yet she can not help pointing out that , far from being gutless , weasels are " bold and confident out of all proportion to their size , and they do not seem to know the rules . " According to King , they are one of the few solitary predators capable of taking on prey larger than themselves . A small but zealous weasel once killed seventeen rats in twenty minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weasel in its talons , about as dire a circumstance as a small furry animal can face . And yet as the hawk 130 A Mouse Like a Spear tlapped skyward , its flight suddenly became erratic . A witness watched it tumble from the sky and found the hawk dead on the ground , with the weasel 's teeth sunk into its breast . The literature also includes a report of an eagle that managed to avoid being killed by a weasel it had plucked up , but lived thereafter with the weasel 's bleached skull permanently latched onto its neck . This is gutlessness only of the most literal , or skeletal , variety . Letterman should be such a sissy . Not , I admit , that anyone is ever going to make the weasel a hero of song and story . It has too many disconcerting habits ? eating bunnies , for instance , and performing the legendary " dance of death " ( about which more later ) . An Irish farmer once told me about being chased down a road late at night by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jugular that even after he ran into his house and bolted the door , the stoat scrabbled furiously at the window pane to get at him . ( " The Weasel never waits to wonder what it is he 's after , " the poet Ted Hughes has written , " It 's butchery he wants , and BLOOD , and merry belly laughter . " ) Never mind that weasels are physically incapable of sucking blood . Their mythology is beyond the reach of reason . The same farmer told me he once saw a stoat funeral cortege proceeding solemnly atop a stone wall . But let 's at least begin the process of rehabilitation with that scarcest commodity in the weasel-human dialectic , the facts : There are about ten weasel species worldwide , not including the closely related minks , ferrets , and polecats . Three of them are abundant in the Northern Hemisphere . Both the short-tailed weasel ( Mustela erminea , also known as the ermine or stoat ) , and the least weasel ( M. nivalis ) evolved in the Old World and spread to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Humans have also introduced both species to New Zealand , where King continued to study them after leaving Oxford in 1972 . ) The long-tailed weasel ( M. frenata ) evolved in North America and has extended its habitat into South America . // Weasels range in body length from five inches ( for the diminutive least weasel ) to twelve inches and seldom weigh more than twelve ounces . They 're blessed with lithe bodies and short legs , the better to enter rodent burrows ; broad flat skulls , to work their powerful jaw muscles on the rodents they find there ; and elongated necks , for toting prey without tripping on their own forelegs . Their shape and their darting movements are perfectly expressed in the genus name Mustela , from the Latin words mus and telos , meaning " a mouse like a spear . " Everything about the weasel is geared to the killing of rodents . Despite the weasel 's exaggerated reputation for raiding henhouses and bird nests , the weasels in one study directed 99 percent of their attacks against rodents ( among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the job for which they evolved in the first place , King theorizes , roughly four million years ago in Eurasia . By that time , grasslands had replaced forests during a period of global cooling , and early forms of voles , mice , and lemmings proliferated in the new habitat . Such rodents are the ultimate weasel convenience food , being abundant , nutritious , very nearly defenseless , and , as King puts it , " wrapped in a waterproof package . " Predators like owls and foxes are held back from these easy pickings by what she calls " the curtain of grass . " They can not pounce until a rodent surfaces from its burrow . The ancestor of the weasel , some larger forest mustelid like the modern marten , presumably shared this handicap . But natural selection soon favored a smaller , slinkier mustelid capable of following the rodents down into the underworld : the weasel . Here is what it 's like trying to study weasels in the field : I went out one morning with a graduate student working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A rainbow arched overhead , but as we set out , the clouds suddenly darkened and sent a cold , miserable rain pelting down . The graduate student carried a plastic bucket of rotting rabbit guts to smear in front of the traps as a 132 A Mouse Like a Spear lure . We came back after an hour soaked , stinking , and emptyhanded . I thought about King 's explanation of why weasel behavior is so little known : " Scientists are human beings , and they like to be sure of getting interesting and reliable results , preferably in the shortest possible time and without getting wet too often . " As a rule , weasels do n't oblige . Would-be predators also seem to find weasels somewhat frustrating . Apart from sheer ferocity , weasels possess a battery of defensive mechanisms . They have been known to play dead . If attacked , they can also unleash a stink bomb ( the skunk , another mustelid , is a relative ) . Like their own prey , weasels are generally hidden by the curtain of grass from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hunt in the open , they seem to be acutely aware of the underworld beneath their feet . King once released a weasel and watched it race ten yards straight to the nearest mole hole , as if this escape route were already mapped out in its head . Weasels also employ camouflage and diversionary tactics for hunting in the open . In northern areas , they turn white in winter to blend in with the snow . Oddly , though , the tails of stoats and longtailed weasels remain prominently black-tipped . But this , too , turns out to be a defensive mechanism , as demonstrated in an ingenious experiment by Roger Powell , now a zoologist at North Carolina State University . As a graduate student in Chicago , Powell trained hawks to chase model long-tailed weasels wrapped in white fur . Using a pulley , he raced the models across a white-painted roof . The hawks , on loose tethers , attacked the all-white weasels with ease . But when Powell used similar models with black-tipped tails , the hawks hesitated for a crucial moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail-tip rather than at the vital organs . Those " weasels " escaped , and the black tail-tip was thus established in science as a device to deflect any predator dumb enough to attack a weasel in the first place . Out in the English countryside the next morning , a hawk soared overhead as I set out with the graduate student in search of 133 a radio-collared stoat . " It 'd be interesting if the hawk came after your stoat , " I said , hopefully . The graduate student , who knew exactly how hard it is to get a radio-collar on a stoat , looked at me as if I were mad . " I 'd rugby-tackle it , " he replied . ( Sadly , the graduate student must go nameless here because live-trapping , radio-collaring , and rugby-tackling can all rouse the ire of England 's animal rights activists . ) For the next two hours , he swept his antenna across fields , meadows , and drainage ditches without success . Just as we were giving up , he cried out , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the steady signal of the stoat . She was resting out of sight in a scrubby patch of thistle .. We sat down to wait , and the graduate student allowed that he liked weasels at least partly because of their bad reputation . Other predators such as badgers and otters , once also regarded as vermin , are now sanctified in children 's literature . But " stoats and weasels are still the little skinheads , the little lager-lout thugs . " He 134 A Mouse Like a Spear paused . " They 're very charismatic creatures . Or maybe the word is enigmatic . When you look at a weasel , what strikes you is how intelligent they are , really looking at you carefully . They 're very curious , investigative creatures . " Suddenly , the stoat appeared , bounding zigzag across the grass to a drainage ditch . We held back a moment to keep out of sight , and then followed her 150 yards to a meadow , where she immediately began to hunt . Her black-tipped tail flicked from one spot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead one moment , as the stoat disappeared down a burrow , then blipped back again a moment later as she resurfaced . She stood on her hind legs , brown and sleek , showing her creamy white underbelly . Her long , snakelike head pivoted from side to side , frantically scanning the grass to see if she 'd stirred up any movement . She leaned forward , as if about to dart at something , then leaped right , and left , and disappeared again , popping up a moment later ten yards away . The grass was spangled with dew , and cows breathed ponderous clouds of steam around their grass-hung mouths . Meanwhile , the mad dog of tunnel warfare was crying " havoc " underfoot . " I bet she 's scaring the shit out of the voles , " the graduate student whispered . There was nothing remotely stealthy about her technique . She was both manic and systematic , demented and yet thorough , qualities that have also been ascribed to the reputed " dance of death , " in which the weasel spins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draw close . At the height of the dance , the weasel , suddenly sane , darts out and puts a death lock on the neck of the nearest member of the audience . Stoats are also believed to mesmerize rabbits into submission with their musky scent . The stoat may not have enough strength in its upper jaw to penetrate the rabbit 's skull and meet the lower canines coming up from the throat . But the rabbit , squealing pitifully , usually dies anyway , of fright . When we left , the stoat was still frantically hunting , and the hawk was wisely looking elsewhere . // Out at Wytham Wood , Carolyn King was telling me about a return visit to Oxford , after being away in New Zealand for twenty years . At the door to the zoology building , a graduate student asked her to identify herself , and on hearing King 's name , exclaimed , " Oh , I know you . " For a moment , King enjoyed the warm sensation of having arrived back among the cognoscenti , where her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and truest audience of informed admirers . Then the graduate student added , " You 're the one who persuaded the university to pay for a pony as your research vehicle . " King had , in fact , entered university legend as a young graduate student by offering to give up her share in the zoology department 's Land Rover in exchange for a pony to run her weasel trapline . " You could buy it for a hundred pounds , run it on grass , and sell it after three years for the same hundred pounds , " she argued , with irresistible logic . " Tell me a Land Rover you can do that with . " Thus Oxford University acquired an old riding school pony named Jenny , which carried King out every morning in Wytham Wood to check her two-and-a-half-mile-long line of live traps . " As well as having a companion I could talk to , which was very important , Jenny was helpful , " King recalled . " I had to anesthetize the weasels I caught , and vaporization of the ether was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ether in Jenny 's saddlebag , which had the advantage of keeping it warm . I remember one terribly raw day , my fingers were too cold to move , and I actually could n't write . I had to go warm my hands under Jenny 's mane . Now , O.K. , a Land Rover you might have heat in , but Jenny was companionable . She never minded if I warmed my hands under her mane . She was a very lovely animal . " The two of them out on " The Singing Way , " under a huge old chestnut in the morning sun , were surely one of the most lyrical sights in all of weasel research . 136 A Mouse Like a Spear King anesthetized any weasel she caught so she could identify it , take its weight , collect fleas and scats , and send it off again two minutes later , all without being bitten . Considering the weasel 's strategy of latching onto victims unto death and beyond , anesthesia seemed prudent . King told me about one dubious theory for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You hold up another finger and wave it in front of the animal 's face . Then , when it lets go of one finger to grab the other , you pull both fingers back . Quickly . I never tested it . I was very lucky never to be bitten by a weasel . But I was very careful . I had huge respect for them . " King was also lucky enough to conduct her study during a great boom in the local weasel population , and in the end she had thirty-seven weasels tagged , most with multiple recaptures . She baited her traps with white mice , which the weasels came to prize . She sometimes released a weasel from one of the first traps of the day only to have it turn up a half-hour later in a trap near the end of the line , perhaps four hundred yards away , " a long way for a tiny little clockwork animal with legs this long . " From her weighing and sampling , King came to see that weasels are not , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowardly or conniving . They are merely carnivores struggling to get by in a world that is at least as perilous for them as for their victims . For example , King suggests that the manic leaping of stoats and weasels might not be a cunning " dance of death , " after all . Dissections of weasels commonly reveal masses of bright red parasitic worms packed into tiny cavities within the bone behind the eyes , causing pressure on the brain . King wonders if the dance might not be merely a response to an intensely annoying parasite ? Other hazards abound . When a weasel 's victim is a rabbit , it may outweigh the weasel by two or three times . A rabbit that has not been " stoated , " meaning terrified or mesmerized into immobility , can kick a weasel to death . Indeed , even the hunting of mice and voles can be hazardous ; their bites can incapacitate a weasel for days . // The weasel 's evolutionary forebears made enormous trade-offs in downsizing to hunt rodents . " The smaller you are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All mammals large and small average roughly the same number of heartbeats and breaths in their lives ? and these processes are much faster in smaller animals . I once held an anesthetized weasel in my hand , and its heart was running like a little sewing machine . . . didididididid . " The pulse of a weasel at rest gallops at 400 to 500 beats a minute , King said , a stoat 's at just under 400 . To supply this hopped-up metabolism , the weasel must eat five or ten meals a day , totaling as much as 35 percent of its body weight . It can not afford to miss many meals , because its subterranean hunting grounds make it impractical for the weasel to carry stored energy in the form of body fat . But it also can not afford to spend a lot of time wandering around looking for something to eat : The small , svelte body shape that is perfect for entering rodent burrows is also the worst possible design for retaining body heat . Unlike most small mammals , the stretched-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it must keep its fur coat thin even in the dead of winter . Moreover , the weasel has no snug little home of its own in which to escape what King calls " the infinite heat sink of the clear night sky . " Finally , contrary to biological theory and plain common sense , weasels and stoats actually tend to get smaller , not larger , the farther north they live ? and thus even less energy-efficient . It sounds like a recipe for evolutionary suicide . But according to King , weasels and stoats thrive or fail on the perilous edge of right-sizing : A weasel can afford to be small only because the runways down which it is thus able to travel usually lead straight to something juicy . Likewise , it needs no permanent home because it can invite itself so easily into Mouse House and Vole Hole , and then snuggle up after dinner in the grassy bed of its suddenly departed host . Being even smaller in the North makes sense , so the animal can spend the winter traveling down tunnels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milder winters in the South allow a slightly larger weasel to step out occasionally 138 A Mouse Like a Spear for a bit of rabbit , or other large game . Everything depends on being just the right size . The weakness in the system is if there suddenly are n't any rodents at the end of the tunnel . When rodent populations go bust , which may be as often as every winter , weasel populations do , too . To adapt to this extremely unstable way of life , weasels have evolved unusual reproductive strategies . The least weasel 's strategy is more obvious than the stoat 's . In the wild , least weasels typically live no more than a year , but a female can give birth and rear her litter to maturity in as little as three months . Unlike any other carnivore , she may then go on , in a good year , to produce a second litter . She can also vary the size of a litter , from zero to eight offspring , depending on what there is to eat . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own in summer . Thus , under ideal conditions , one female weasel in spring can yield thirty weasels by early fall . Then comes the inevitable rodent crash of winter , which can cause the weasel population to die back as fast as it has blossomed . The strategy of stoats and long-tailed weasels , by contrast , sounds distinctly perverse . Stoats traditionally have been sex symbols of a sort in England . A lecherous man was sometimes described as " a bit of a stoat , " perhaps by association with the suggestive shape or the frantic , lunging style of a stoat on the hunt . But science now suggests that the association is far more apt than anyone ever suspected . Reproduction in stoats and long-tailed weasels is complicated by delayed implantation , a phenomenon best known in larger , longer-lived animals like seals and bears . The female gets pregnant in spring , the fertilized eggs then go into a state of suspended animation for perhaps ten months , and birth does not occur until the following spring . Since stoats and long-tailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , delayed implantation sounds like an enormous waste of time . King theorizes that the trait is a hand-me-down from the common ancestor of all weasels . Least weasels simply got rid of it as // they evolved to take rapid advantage of rodent outbreaks . But stoats and long-tailed weasels stuck with delayed implantation . To compensate for the slower reproductive time , they developed what King calls the " extraordinary precocity of the juvenile females . " While the adult female is still nursing her litter , the male stoat comes to visit , often bearing gifts of food . Early observers , full of warm animal-story notions about the countryside , thought this was his way to help out with parenting . But this male is unlikely to be the father of the litter , conceived a year earlier , and he plays no part in child rearing . The gifts are intended , apparently , to elicit sexual favors , and this is where things start to get rocky for the anthropomorphic frame of mind . Not only is the adult female ready to breed again while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compete with her for the attentions of the visiting male . Nor is it merely the food they want . On his visit , the male mates with the mother and all her infant daughters . It is n't " an animal version of rape , " said King . " They are positively keen , these little hussies . " In one case , the party included a seventeen-day-old who was still deaf , blind , and toothless . But eager . Clearly ( and if you have finished gasping , we can perhaps proceed ) , some lessons are best not learned from the natural world . Likewise , it is best not to apply human values to other species . The combination of delayed implantation and female precocity makes sense for stoats and long-tailed weasels , according to King , because it means that almost all females are " pregnant " ? that is , carrying fertilized eggs ? almost all the time . In one study of five hundred female stoats , she found only two that were not impregnated . So if the rodent food supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available the following spring , a lone female can still repopulate a habitat with her own offspring . In New Zealand , where stoats are considered a pest ( having been introduced originally in an unsuccessful attempt to control rabbits ) , lone females sometimes swim out to island nature reserves , where their offspring are soon laying waste the native birds .
