Modernism overtook 20th-century jewelry in gradual stages . By the end of World War I , expensive jewelry was shedding aspects of the old sumptuous tradition and showing up in some Parisian salons sleekly , and often superbly , designed . In the 40s , as influences from Scandinavia grew , jewelry , generally in silver , looked to simplified formal elements and fine craftsmanship . At the same time , ideas still strongly in the air from the Bauhaus and de Stijl movements were awakening adventurous metalsmiths to even greater possibilities of geometry and linearity . Jewelry design by some well-known artists and industrial designers also helped extend the borders . And so in the mid-60s , the shifting Zeitgeist , with its impetus to social change , set the stage for a revolution in ornament . It happened first , or at least most visibly , in Holland and England , where radical departures were taking place in jewelry materials and design concepts . And it was at this moment that Helen Williams Drutt came on the scene . Over almost 30 years , Drutt has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last three decades . Selected works from the collection , which has traveled internationally , are at the Bellerive Museum in Zurich , Switzerland ( February 10-May 1 ) . By 1964 Drutt was raising a family , trying out various jobs and becoming fascinated with contemporary craft . But she still saw jewelry as " something you wore to go with your outfit , " she recalled . Then she visited the metalsmith Stanley Lechtzin , who was perfecting his mastery of electroforming , a process enabling him to make massive jewelry in precious metals that felt as light as aluminum . Drutt bought a Lechtzin piece , and at almost the same moment discovered the Swedish-born jeweler Olaf Skoogfors who , like Lechtzin , was living and teaching in Philadelphia , and acquired one of his works . Whereas Lechtzin represented splendid and intricate ornament to Drutt , Skoogfors offered quiet strength , a look of largeness , reflectiveness and balance . Acquisitions from two of Lechtzin 's students soon followed : Albert Paley , who was already showing incipient architectural interests in his big , organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterned stones to create her geometric jewelry . Through Moty , Drutt met J. Fred Woell and acquired work in yet another vein  --  his merry political mix of objets trouves . So even early in her collecting , Drutt 's range was broad . By the early 70s , her horizons had expanded to include European jewelry as well . She had discovered what was going on overseas , particularly through the catalog of " Gold &; Silber , Schmuck &; Gerat , " a landmark jewelry and holloware exhibition held in Nuremberg , Germany , in 1971 . As executive director of the Philadelphia Council of Professional Craftsmen , Drutt organized , in 1973 , the first American show of the then-radical British jewelers Wendy Ramshaw and David Watkins . In the Philadelphia gallery bearing her name that she opened that same year , and where she continues to show a variety of crafts in addition to jewelry , she exhibited the late Emmy van Leersum and her husband , Gijs Bakker , both iconoclastic and influential Dutch goldsmiths . By this time she had met Claus Bury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Atlantic with his experimental combinations of metals and layered acrylics . Drutt acquired work from them all . If her collection is less than comprehensive , it does not miss much . She has work in alternative materials , from aluminum to steel to plastics , and geometric design , in its multitude of forms , is amply represented . She is charmed by the splash of image as well as the wit of assemblage , the reductive along with the baroque , the plebeian along with the precious . Once Drutt began to collect in earnest and also wear the work , she continued to do so not just for the love of the objects but because she saw herself as an educator , a proselytizer , a documenter , an archivist , and as a walking advertisement for a new art . In becoming an ambulatory " billboard , " as Drutt puts it , she made sure it was she who wore the jewelry and not the reverse . She dons pieces like an accomplished actress trying on roles . Almost from the beginning she sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece was and what it did when on the body . Jewelry has always been inherently functional , of course . Whatever else its purpose , like clothing , it is meant to be worn . But from the 60s onward , functionalism in jewelry took on a different meaning . Ornament , the new jewelers said , must be concerned with its interrelationship with the body . In this symbiotic state , the ornament and the body/person/persona elucidate and extend one another . They form a new whole . The British writer Peter Dormer has added another and critical element to this equation by triangulating it in his thoughtful and informative essay written for the catalog/brochure accompanying " Contemporary Jewellery 1964-1993 " : " Although the relationship between jewellery and the wearer is aesthetically important , " he writes , " jewellery 's extended subject matter is the relationship of the jewellery , the wearer  --  and other people . " * In the modernist movement there were and are other programs besides function as a proposition of the dynamic between human beings and design . But the fascinating concept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation between the wearer and what is worn is probably central to Drutt 's knowledgeable and eclectic collection . A tall , ample , well-curved woman almost always in black , and smartly hatted indoors and out , Helen Drutt puts on a piece of jewelry and instantly it is part of her . She pokes her head through a stiff , square , translucent white ruff , a work by Gijs Bakker , and it looks as casual as a scarf would on someone else . She thrusts her hand through Bakker 's wide spiral of white plastic , which in its lazy , loopy curving seems in perpetual motion , and it becomes simply the bracelet of the day . Then she adds another , a broad curving silver cuff by Breon O'Casey , the Anglo-Irish jeweler , and it flashes on her arm as she reaches for and holds up his elementally Celtic necklace of chunks of silver and granite . She takes off the two bracelets and puts on one by Peter Chang , who lives in Scotland . A gaily colored carved and inlaid acrylic bauble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese child 's toy , or the teething ring of a giant . For sheer hyperbole , on her other arm she puts an aggressive bangle bristling with a ring of bulls ' heads in papier-mache , the work of the Dutch jeweler Petra Hartman ; she jiggles her arm in the air and one thinks of matadors . She removes the ruff from her neck and pins one of her first Albert Paley brooches on the front of her black tunic : descending in a blocky triangular form , it settles comfortably over her chest . Then from a box she pulls out the least of the less , some utterly minimal pins by the German jeweler Georg Dobler that are a few mere black lines in painted steel that will disappear against a black background . This demonstration of both the catholicity of her taste and her understanding of how to wear ornament is spellbinding . More jewelry , much more , comes tumbling out of boxes . More is tried on . As a grand finale , she takes another work by Gijs Bakker , an improbably huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic ) with an opening in its center , and pulls it over her head . And she becomes the center of the rose . She the wearer , the ornament and the ideas that bind the collection have blended and now are one . * " Contemporary Jewellery 1964-1993 : Selected Works , Helen Williams Drutt Collection " was shown at the Arkansas Arts Center Decorative Arts Museum ( October 8-November 21 ) .
