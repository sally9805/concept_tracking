Chapter OnePrologue There were twenty-two days to go before Christmas , but Lenny was doing his Christmas shopping early this year . Secure in the knowledge that no one knew he was there , and standing so still and quiet that he hardly could hear himself breathe , he watched from the confessional as Monsignor Ferris went about the rounds of securing the church for the night . With a contemptuous smile , Lenny waited impatiently as the side doors were checked and the lights in the sanctuary extinguished . He shrank back when he saw the monsignor turn to walk down the side aisle , which meant that he would pass directly by the confessional . He cursed silently when a floorboard in the enclosure squeaked . Through a slit in the curtain he could see the clergyman stop and tilt his head , as if listening for another sound . But then , as if satisfied , Monsignor Ferris resumed his journey to the back of the church . A moment later , the light in the vestibule was extinguished , and a door opened and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone in St. Clement 's church on West 103rd Street in Manhattan . Sondra stood in the doorway of a townhouse across the street from the church . The building was under repair , and the temporary scaffolding around the street level shielded her from the view of passersby . She wanted to be sure that Monsignor had left the church and was in the rectory before she left the baby . She had been attending services at St. Clement 's for the last couple of days and had become familiar with his routine . She also knew that during Advent he would now be conducting a seven o'clock recitation of the rosary service . Weak from the strain and fatigue of the birth only hours earlier , her breasts swelling with the fluid that preceded her milk , she leaned against the door frame for support . A faint whimper from beneath her partially buttoned coat made her arms move in the rocking motion instinctive to mothers . On a plain sheet of paper that she would leave with the baby she had written everything she could safely reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loving family to raise . Her father is of Italian descent ; my grandparents were born in Ireland . Neither family has any hereditary diseases that I am aware of , so she should be healthy . I love her , but I can not take care of her . If she asks about me someday , show her this note , please . Tell her that the happiest hours of my life will always be the ones when I held her in my arms after she was born . For those moments it was just the two of us , alone in the world . " Sondra felt her throat close as she spotted the tall , slightly stooped figure of the monsignor emerge from the church and walk directly to the adjacent rectory . It was time . She had bought baby clothes and supplies , including a couple of shirts , a long nightgown , booties and a hooded jacket , bottles of formula and disposable diapers . She had wrapped the baby papoose-style , in two receiving blankets and a heavy woolen robe , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had brought along a brown paper shopping bag . She had read somewhere that paper was a good insulator against the cold . Not that the baby would be out in the frigid air for long , of course  --  just until Sondra could get to a phone and call the rectory . She unbuttoned her coat slowly , shifting the baby only as needed , remembering to be especially careful of her head . The faint glow from the streetlight made it possible for her to see her infant 's face clearly . " I love you , " Sondra whispered fiercely . " And I will always love you . " The baby stared up at her , her eyes fully open for the first time . Brown eyes stared into blue eyes , long dark-blond hair brushed against sprigs of the blond hair curling on the little forehead ; tiny lips puckered and turned , seeking Mother 's breast . Sondra pressed the baby 's head against her neck ; her lips lingered on the soft cheek ; her hand caressed the infant 's back and legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tiny figure into the shopping bag , reached for the secondhand stroller folded next to her and tucked the handle under one arm . She waited until several people had walked past her hiding place , then hurried to the curb and looked up and down the street . A block away traffic was stopped at the red light , but she saw no pedestrians coming in either direction . A solid wall of parked cars on both sides of the street helped to protect Sondra from any curious eyes as she darted across the street to the rectory . There she ran up the three steps to the narrow stoop and opened the stroller . After engaging the brake , she laid the baby snugly under the stroller 's hood and laid the bundle of clothes and bottles at her feet . She knelt for a moment and took one last look at her child . " Good-bye , " she whispered . Then she stood and quickly ran down the steps and headed toward Columbus Avenue . She would make the call to the rectory from a street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out of a church in less than three minutes . You never know about silent alarms , he thought , as he opened his backpack and pulled out a flashlight . Keeping the narrow beam pointed toward the floor , he quickly began to make his usual rounds . He went to the poor box first . Donations had been down lately , he 'd noticed , but this one yielded a better than usual take , somewhere between thirty and forty dollars . The offering boxes below the votive candles turned out to be the most satisfactory of any of the last ten churches he had hit . There were seven of them , placed at intervals in front of the statues of the saints . Quickly he smashed the locks and grabbed the cash . In the last month he 'd come to Mass here a couple of times to study the layout ; he had observed that the priest consecrated the bread and wine in plain goblets , so he did n't bother to break into the tabernacle , since there 'd be nothing special there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . The couple of years he 'd spent in parochial school had had an effect on him , he acknowledged , making him queasy about doing certain things . It definitely got in his way when it came to robbing churches . On the other hand , he had no qualms about leaving with the prize that had brought him here in the first place , the silver chalice with the star-shaped diamond at the base . It had belonged to Joseph Santori , the priest who founded St. Clement 's parish one hundred years ago , and it was the one treasure this historic church contained . A painting of Santori hung above a mahogany cabinet in a recess to the right of the sanctuary . The cabinet was ornate , its grillwork designed to both protect and display the chalice . After one of the masses he had attended , Lenny had drifted over to read the plaque beneath the cabinet . At his ordination in Rome , Father , later Bishop , Santori was given this cup by Countess Maria Tomicelli . It had been in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 , Joseph Santori was consecrated as a bishop and assigned to the See of Rochester . Upon his retirement at age 75 , he returned to St. Clement 's , where he spent his remaining years working among the poor and the elderly . Bishop Joseph Santori 's reputation for holiness was so widespread that after his death , a petition was signed to ask the Holy See to consider him for beatification , a cause that remains active today . The diamond definitely would bring a few bucks , Lenny thought as he swung his hatchet . With two hard blows he smashed the hinges of the cabinet . He yanked open the doors and grabbed the chalice . Afraid that he might have triggered a silent alarm , he quickly ran to the side door of the church , unlocked it and pushed it open , anxious now to get out . As he turned west toward Columbus Avenue , the cold air quickly dried the perspiration that had covered his face and back . Once on the avenue , he knew he could disappear into the crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall of an approaching police siren shattered the calm . He could see two couples down the block , headed in the same direction he was going , but he did n't dare to start running to catch up with them . That would be a sure giveaway . Then he spotted the stroller on the rectory steps . In an instant he was carrying it down to the sidewalk . There appeared to be nothing in it but a couple of shopping bags . Shoving his backpack in the foot of the stroller , he walked quickly to catch up with the couples ahead of him . Once he was near them , he strolled sedately just behind . The police car roared past the group and screeched to a halt in front of the church . At Columbus Avenue , Lenny quickened his steps , no longer worried about detection . On such a chilly night , all pedestrians were hurrying , anxious to reach their destinations . He would just blend in . There was no reason for anyone to pay attention to the average-sized , sharp-faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap and a plain , dark jacket and pushing a cheap , well-worn stroller . The street phone Sondra had planned to call from was in use . Wildly anxious with impatience and already heartsick about the baby she had abandoned , she tried to decide whether to interrupt the caller , a man wearing the uniform of a security guard . She could explain that it was an emergency . I ca n't do that , she thought despairingly . Tomorrow , if there 's a story in the newspapers about the baby , he might remember me and talk to the police . Dismayed , she shoved her hands in her pockets , groping for the coins she needed and the paper on which she 'd written the phone number of the rectory , unnecessary because she knew it by heart . It was December 3rd , and already Christmas lights and decorations glittered from the windows of the shops and restaurants along Columbus Avenue . A couple walking hand in hand passed Sondra , their faces radiant as they smiled at each other . The girl appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although she felt infinitely older  --  and infinitely removed from the air of careless joy this couple displayed . It was getting colder . Was the baby wrapped warmly enough ? she worried . For an instant she shut her eyes . O , God , please make this man get off the phone , she prayed , I need to make this call now . An instant later she heard the click of the receiver being replaced . Sondra waited until the caller was a few paces away before she grabbed the receiver , dropped in the coins and dialed . " St. Clement 's rectory . " The voice was that of an elderly man . It had to be the old priest she had seen at Mass . " Please , may I speak to Monsignor Ferris , right away . " " I 'm Father Dailey . Perhaps I can help you . Monsignor is outside with the police . We have an emergency . " Quietly , Sondra broke the connection . They had found the baby already . She was safe now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good home . An hour later Sondra was on the bus to Birmingham , Alabama , where she was a student in the music department of the university , a violin student whose astonishing talent had already marked her for future stardom on the concert stage . It was not until he was in the apartment of his elderly aunt that Lenny heard the faint mewling of the infant . Startled , he looked into the stroller . He saw the shopping bag begin to move and quickly tore it open ; he stared in shock at the tiny occupant . Unbelieving , he unpinned the note from the blanket , read it and mouthed an expletive . From the bedroom at the end of the narrow hallway , his aunt called : " Is that you , Lenny ? " There was no hint of a welcome in the greeting , spoken with a strong accent that betrayed her Italian roots . " Yes , Aunt Lilly . " There was no way he could simply hide the baby . He had to figure out what to do . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall to the living room . At seventy-four , she both looked and moved like someone ten years younger than her age . Her hair , pulled back in a tight bun , was still generously sprinkled with black strands ; her brown eyes were large and lively , and her short , ample body moved in quick , sure steps . Along with Lenny 's mother , her younger sister , she had emigrated to the United States from Italy shortly after World War II . A skilled seamstress , she had married a tailor from her native village in Tuscany and worked side by side with him in their tiny Upper West Side shop until his death five years ago . Now she worked out of her apartment , or went to the homes of her devoted clients , whom she charged far too little for dressmaking and alterations . But as her customers joked among themselves , in exchange for Lilly 's low prices , they were forced to lend considerable sympathetic attention to her endless stories about her troublesome nephew Lenny . On her knees , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measuring as she chalked hem lengths , Lilly would sigh , then launch into her litany of complaints . " My nephew . He 's always driving me crazy . Trouble from the day he was born . When he was in school : Do n't ask . Arrested . Went away to a prison for kids twice . Did that straighten him out ? No . Never can hold a job . Why not ? My sister , his mama , God rest her , always was too easy on him . I love him , of course  --  after all , he 's my flesh and blood  --  but he drives me crazy . How much can I put up with , him coming in at all hours ? What 's he living on , I ask you ? " But now , after earnest prayer to her beloved St. Francis of Assisi , Lilly Maldonado had made a decision . She had tried everything , and none of it had made a difference . Clearly nothing was going to change Lenny , and so she was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The light in the foyer was dim , and she was so intent on delivering her speech that she did not immediately notice the stroller behind him . Her arms folded , her voice firm , Lilly said , " Lenny , you asked if you could stay a few nights . Well , that was three weeks ago , and I do n't want you here anymore . Pack your bags and get out . " Lilly 's loud , strident tone startled the already stirring infant , and the faint mewling broke into a wall . " What ? " Lilly exclaimed . Then she saw the stroller . In a quick move , she shoved her nephew aside and looked down into it . Shocked , she snapped , " What have you done now ? Where did you get that baby ? " Lenny thought fast . He did n't want to leave this apartment . It was a perfect place to live , and staying with his aunt gave him the aura of respectability . He had read the note from the baby 's mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's mine , Aunt Lilly . A girl I was crazy about is the mother . But she 's moving to California and wants to put the baby up for adoption . I do n't want to . I want to keep her . " The wall was now a demanding screech . Tiny fists flailed the air . Lilly opened the bundle at the infant 's feet . " The baby 's hungry , " she announced . " At least your girlfriend sent some formula . " She plucked out one of the bottles and thrust it at Lenny . " Here , warm this up . " Her expression changed as she unwrapped the blankets from around the tiny infant , picked her up and cradled her in warm and comforting arms . " Beautiful , bella . How could your mama not want you ? " She looked at Lenny . " What do you call her ? " Lenny thought of the star-shaped diamond in the chalice . " Her name is Star , Aunt Lilly . " " Star , " Lilly Maldonado murmured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would call her Stellina . That means ' little star . ' " Through narrowed eyes , Lenny watched the bonding between the infant and the aging woman . No one would be looking for the baby , he thought . It was n't like he had kidnapped it , and anyhow , if anything ever did come up about the kid , he 'd have the note to prove she had been abandoned . He knew the word for grandmother in Italian was nonna . As he turned and hurried into the kitchen to warm the bottle , Lenny told himself with satisfaction , " Star , my little girl , I 've found me a home  --  and you 've got yourself a nonna. "
