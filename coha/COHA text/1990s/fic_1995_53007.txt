And I saw her fall from the sky . <p> The failed hang-glider had begun to spin like a sycamore seed . Then the sail snapped upward at the keel and became a plunging V. At this point she must have pulled the handle of the parachute . The chute failed to separate from her harness . Orange nylon blossomed but was trapped . <p> I saw Amberfall . That was my intimate name for Isabelle because of the tan of her skin and the beads of her nipples . I watched her plum met to earth . <p> Afterward I wept for her just as Phaeton 's sisters wept for their brother after he was hurled from the sky because he flew the sun-chariot crawly . But my tears were only salt water . They did n't harden into amber . Not as yet . . . <p> I must have been eleven when I first began to dream of flying . In my dreams I soared above the ripe cornfields of the English West Country underneath a wing . The wing was smooth , not feathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky of my dreams the sun was a golden ball , a rich warm aromatic sphere , the quintessence of harvest . I believed I had identified the true substance of that sun when my grandmother , Gran-Annie , showed me a large bead of amber . <p> The fields beneath me were imprinted with patterns suggestive of runes or astrological symbols . I honestly ca n't recall whether " crop circles , " so called , had already begun to appear in genuine fields . A memory is n't like a leaf perfectly preserved in amber for all time . We do n't remember a past even t in itself , but rather our memory of that event . Subsequently we remember the memory of a memory . Thus our mind forever updates itself . Essentially memories are fictions . Each time that we suppose we are remembering , these fictions are being rewritten within ourselves , with ourselves as heroes or victims . <p> When my dreams began , crop circles were probably already materializing overnight in corn fields . Maybe this had been happening on and off for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the phenomenon . Later , these circles became a temporary media sensation . <p> What wild stories there were in the newspapers ! The patterns must be enigmatic attempts at communication on the part of some alien intelligence ! Or possibly archetypal imagery was being stamped upon patches of plants by some kind of collective planetary mind . . . <p> Even to my immature mind I 'm sure that speculations of this sort would have seemed nutty . Surely those convolutions in the crops were none other than the wind itself made visible . Eddies and swirls and turbulence . Did not the wind forever comb the hair of the tom , gently or roughly ? All the air of the world was akin to the skin of a body , ceaselessly rippling and flexing sweating or shivering . Air is a vast living organ , though a mindless one . <p> Surely no one could fall from such a dreamy sky ? Surely no one could plunge to earth , and die ? <p> In due course , I took up hang-gliding passionately . Presently I was equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became profession . With Max Palmer as partner I rounded a fledgling company to design and build new high-performance hang-gliders : craft with wider spans and nose angles , with tighter sails and more battens to camber the roached trailing edges of the airfoil ( to be technical for a moment ) . <p> Maxburn Airfoils combined Max 's first name with my surname , suggesting flying feats at the leading edge of possibility . Max Palmer and Peter Burn : two aces . It was financial backing from Max 's family which allowed us to set up , thus his name preceded mine . The company fledged and soared . We even carried out some design consultancy work for NASA , honey upon the bread and butter of our regular manufacturing . Usually I wore Gran-Annie 's bead as a pendant around my neck instead of a tie . <p> Surely no one could fall . <p> Until I fell in love  --  or in lust  --  with Max 's Isabelle . Until Isabelle - until Amber  --  fell . <p> A hang-glider pilot aims to see the invisible . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , he throws dry grasses . He kicks dust . He eyes the flutter of a ribbon , the ripple of tree-tops , the progress of smoke and clouds . Eventually , for a few of us , an extra perception is born . <p> As a boy a premonition of this perception showed me the words of wind written upon the fields . In the ghastly wake of Isabelle 's death impassioned perception took me to Kaliningrad on the Baltic coast in search of the lost room of amber  --  the lost room of Amber herself . I 'd begun to dream of finding that room , and my lost love within it . <p> An entire room wrought of amber ! <p> Gran-Annie first told me the tale . The central luminary of my dreams was a sphere of smoldering amber , so naturally I was enthralled . I concocted various boyish adventure fantasies about finding the room . But it was only after Isabelle died that I began to dream repeatedly of doing so in an airborne context . The room had bizarrely replaced the crop circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ German grandmother had been dead for five years , but I soon reacquainted myself with all the details of the story . <p> The creation of the amber room began in the year 1702 in Denmark . Disagreements and delays occurred , but by 1713 the amber room was on display in Berlin , either gloriously or partially , when Peter the Great visited Frederick . The ebullient Tsar was so enchanted that Frederick could do no other than make a gift of the whole caboodle to Peter . <p> Off to the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg went sleigh-loads of crates containing wall panels , pediments , turned comers , embellishments , rosettes , et al . <p> In 1755 Empress Elizabeth had the room transferred to the Summer Palace at Tsarskoe Selo . Finishing touches were still occurring as late as 1763  --  culminating in one of the wonders of the world . Visitors expressed their sense of stepping inside of a dream or fantasy . <p> Although constructed by human hands , surely that room did indeed partake of otherness . Such golden luminosity ! Such mosaic contrasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a wealth of carvings : of Roman landscapes allegorizing the human senses , and of flowers and garlands and of tiny figures las if seen from high in the air ) and of trees . Such mirrors , such chandeliers dripping amber lustres . Amazing the parquet floor . Ravishing , the allegorical ceiling . <p> In 1941 , eight years after Gran-Annie 's parents fled with her from Germany , Nazi armies were about to lay siege to Leningrad . Art treasures were being evacuated to vaults in the Urals  --  but the Germans overran the Summer Palace . They dismantled the amber room and shipped it to Konigsberg Castle . There , it was reassembled under the eye of the director of the Prussian Fine Arts Museum , a certain Dr. Alfred Rohde . ( It was from seven hundred kilometers further west , from Hannover , that Gran-Annie 's parents had emigrated to England . ) <p> Within a couple of years loot filled Konigsberg Castle to bursting point . But British bombs ! were raining ; down . Dismantled once more , the room departed  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Konigsberg was overrun , soon to become Kaliningrad  --  politically a district of Russia but separated by the three Baltic republics . <p> Weirdly , Dr. Rohde returned to his post . He co-operated freely with the Soviet occupation forces . Yet he disclaimed any knowledge of the whereabouts of the wonder of the world . Soon after Dr. Rohde 's return , he and his wife both died suddenly . According to their death certificates the cause was dysentery . These documents were signed by a Dr. Paul Erdman  --  but when the KGB investigated they could find no trace of any such doctor . <p> Supposedly the dismantled amber room came to rest on the bottom of the Baltic Sea some twenty nautical miles off the German coast in a ship which a Soviet submarine had torpedoed . <p> There is such a thing as disinformation . . . <p> The Nazis had a fetish about mountains as last redoubts  --  about Eagle 's Nests , and high eyries . Would n't the perfect place to hide the amber room be a mountain range where aircraft could not easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imposed upon me the conviction that this was so , and that the hiding place could only be found from the air , bird-like , Godlike , in solitary flight . When I contemplated finding that missing room I was a boy again , enraptured . <p> Thus might Amber 's death be exorcised . <p> Naturally I did n't talk to Max about this method of coping with tragedy . He had his own means of handling grief . Max immersed himself in design work  --  especially as regards the ; catastrophic failure of the airfoil which had plunged Isabelle to her death . I ' was fairly sure that he would search in vain for the cause . His feel for gliders  --  at the edge of possibility  --  was less than mine . I 'd always been able to reach that little way beyond him . Now I would reach a long way , from England to former East Prussia . <p> I simply had to visit the last known location of the amber room . Surely I would meet some aficionado of amber who knew more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the seaside town of Yantarny - literally , Amberville . That 's the source of ninety percent of the world 's present-day supplies of amber . If you rub amber , it develops a static electric charge . Kaliningrad was drawing me like a magnet . <p> I told Max that I was going to Germany to revisit my grandmother 's roots and to investigate the possibility of exporting hang-gliders . I would n't try to fool Max that I was hoping to sell our products in those lake-strewn boggy Baltic flatlands where the economies are bumping awkwardly along ! Than ks to Gran-Annie I was fluent in German . If English was n't understood much in Kaliningrad , German should be a reasonable bet . After the Second World War it 's true that most of the German population of the Kaliningrad region was either dead or expelled or sent to Siberia , but since the demise of the Soviet Union , Kaliningrad had became a free port to attract prosperity , and the closest source of prosperity was . Germany . <p> With a sail secured on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland . In Warsaw I was obliged to garage my transport . Whatever its free port status , the Kaliningrad region was militarily sensitive due to being the most westerly redoubt of the rump of Russia . The Polish border was n't open to ordinary civilian road traffic  --  and I hardly intended to emulate Matthias Russ , or whatever his name was , by hang-gliding my way into the area . <p> Ach : those Baltic flatlands ! The nearest mountains were the Carpathians . A tidy way to the south , those sprawl across a thousand kilometers from Poland to Slovakia into Romania . The amber room had to be somewhere in the Carpathians . But without some clue even a person of special perception could spend ten years searching : that range from the air . <p> I allowed myself two weeks . Continued absence would amount to a betrayal of Max , and of Maxburn Airfoils too . <p> * * * <p> I had seen Amber fall from the sky . <p> I flew to Kaliningrad on a newly inaugurated direct flight from Warsaw , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove crucial . <p> Manning the desk were a fresh-faced young officer and a sallow older colleague whose high cheekbones and absence of folds to the eyelids proclaimed Mongol blood in his ancestry . . . <p> Now , I 'd opted for a tourist visa , which meant that I 'd been obliged to arrange accommodation expensively in advance . Intourist in London had tried to book me into a so-called " ' floating palace " on the river in the center of the city . A couple of cruise ships were permanently moored in lieu of modem luxury hotels . The month of May was an excellent time to stay in one of those , supposedly . <p> I did n't wish to be cooped up where my comings and goings could be monitored . And what was this business about the month of May ? Further questioning of the Intourist lady , who had actually visited Kaliningrad , disclosed that in May the weather would n't be scorching , consequently I could keep the porthole of my cabin shut . The river , it seemed , stank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firma several kilometers from the city center . The Baltika was very popular with tour companies , I was assured . <p> The younger immigration officer wished to see how much money I had with me . This seem ed an American sort of question in this city where all hard currencies were legal tender nowadays . Despite having prepaid for my hotel , Did I have enough to support myself during my stay ? I did have enough , and more . Much more . <p> He eyed my amber pendant . " Are you here to buy jewelry ? " he demanded . " Your passport says you are an engineer . " <p> We were speaking German . The older man interrupted to point out that I seemed very fluent in German , whereas my passport was a British one . <p> " My Grossmutter came from Germany , " I told him . <p> " From so-called Northern East Prussia , Herr Burn ? " Did I detect a note of nationalist displeasure ? " Nordliche Ostpreussen " was how Germans still referred to the Kaliningrad Oblast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She fled from the Nazis in ' 34 . She hated Nazis . " <p> The man smiled , then . <p> " Is an engineer here to buy jewelry ? " persisted the junior officer . Why the quiz ? Amber is hardly gold or rubies . Who would wish to smuggle it ? As I understood , the bottom had virtually fallen out of the Western market for amber . With the disintegration of the superpower , any wannabe Russian rock group would bring out a haversack full of the stuff to pay their way . Maybe my fellow passengers  --  principally Poles  --  were n't as interesting as myself to interrogate . Or maybe obstructiveness lingered . <p> " I 'm fascinated by the history of the amber room , " I said  --  a harmless enough admission , not to mention being the truth . <p> The young man looked blank . " The amber room ? " I suppose you might meet a native of London who has n't the foggiest idea where the Crown Jewels are housed . The other officer spoke rapidly in Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the young officer enquired what sort of engineer I was , and when I specified hang-gliders the older man reached for my passport and my hotel confirmation with such an impetuous hand that he actually knocked the documents off the desk . I would have picked these up myself but he stepped swiftly ' out to do so . As he rose , his lapel bulged and I noticed a badge pinned on the inside where it would n't normally be seen . A disc , the size of a small coin , bore a double-headed eagle . The old imperial eagle , emblem of the TSars . . . He must be a nationalist  --  of a far-out eccentric royalist stripe . All sorts of strange creatures had crawled out of the woodwork when the Soviet Union fell apart . <p> I was irritated by the delay . But also I felt suddenly possessed , in that moment , by my dream perception  --  galvanized and beguiled . The words jerked out of me almost inadvertently : <p> " Maybe , " I burbled , " a hang-gilder pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Then I laughed dismissively . <p> In fact , the young officer had had my best interests at heart . If I was going to be carrying a lot of money round , it might be sensible to hire a driver , an interpreter , an escort , if I followed his drift . A reliable and discreet man from a private security company . Kaliningrad was n't awash with crime to the extent , alas , of Moscow or St. Petersburg . Yet even so ! A word to the wise . He produced a little printed card with address and phone number and printed a name on the back . <p> " My name . Tell them that I recommended you  --  " <p> No doubt for a percentage of the fee which I would be paying . . The older man did n't want me to take the card . He became quite vociferous , in Russian . Maybe he viewed this as an insult to his nation . I think he would have confiscated the card if this had been within his power . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and guide for my stay in Kaliningrad . <p> The fellow bore quite a resemblance to me  --  though this is purely coincidental . Both of us were only of medium height , though big-boned . We were both endowed with freckles and curly gingery hair and light blue eyes . Somewhere in Pavel 's ancestry them must have been a Viking or two . He could have served as a double if he had exchanged his cheap leather jacket for my more fashionable anorak , and had donned the amber pendant . He carried a registered firearm , and was discretion itself as regards my business . Maybe his employers supplied a pamphlet on " How to be a Minder . " Rule one : maintain a bland facade . Of course , to begin with it would have seemed that he was merely minding a tourist with a particular interest in amber . <p> Next day , he collected me from the Baltika in a dark green Mercedes with lots of kilometers cm the dock . Its bodywork might be green but its exhaust emissions no longer were . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets of this dreary city which had risen upon the rains of grand old Konigsberg were full of fumes . The river was indeed as black and murky as old engine oil . Bleak wastelands punctuated some remarkably ugly Soviet architecture . The old Cathedral was a shell , though some scaffolding hinted at possible restoration . The castle , where Dr. Rohde had stored the room , had been a shell  --  till it was demolished by dynamite to make way for a House of Soviets which , Pard remarked , was too ugly for anyone ever to have the gall to complete . <p> Pavel pointed out a certain pink building beside the North Station , which had been KGB headquarters . That 's where he had worked until he had privatized himself . I suppose this admission exonerated him of being any son of informer nowadays . <p> We visited the Amber Museum , which was located in a burly red brick tower . That tower was one of the survivors of war , as were a number of city gates and bastions . Personally I found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pavel I quizzed the dumpy lady director , who spoke no German , about the amber room . <p> She believed the submarine story . <p> I asked her about Rohde 's death . On this topic she had no opinions . <p> I told her that I was researching a thriller which I had long yearned to write on account of my German grandmother . This cover story had occurred to me in view of my experience at the airport . I would announce my ambition blatantly  --  but in the guise of fiction . I aimed to write a story about a hang-glider pilot who hunts for , and finds , the lost amber room in a mountainous Nazi hiding place . I assured the lady director that I was interested in any hypothesis , however fantastic . <p> However , fantasy was n't her forte . " Herr Burn , " she lectured me ( via Pavel ) , " have you not noticed the blinds at all the windows ? Have you not seen how thick the glass display cases are ? Sunlight degrades amber over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Air oxidizes it till it is so brittle that it can distintegrate into a pile of dust . You speak of the amber room being kept in the open somewhere , fully assembled , exposed to wind and sunlight ? What stupidity . " <p> Absolutely the room must be out in the open , three-dimensionally , beneath the sky , not packed flat in cases in some cavern ! The parquet floor , the great wall panels , the allegorical ceiling dangling its chandeliers : all must be erected and connected , and suffusing and refracting golden light . How else could it conform to my dream ? How else could Amber herself be waiting in the room ? <p> " Sheer stupidity . " <p> My interview was at an end . <p> I went with Pavel to a shop specializing in amber jewelry on Leninsky prospekt , and then to another on prospekt Mira . Despite our proximity to Yantarny  --  to Amberville-by-the-sea  --  there was a dearth of decent merchandise on display . The proprietor of the first shop became brusque when he grasped that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with fanciful questions . The manager of the second was eager that I should include the exact address of his premises in my prospective best-seller  --  which in his opinion ought to be about an attempt to refloat the torpedoed ship , in the style of Raise the Titanic , and featuring neo-Nazi conspirators . He urged me to visit the Bunker Museum near the university . That bunker was the command post of Hitler 's Reich till the Red Army overran the devastated city . Part of it had been left completely untouched since the day the surrender was signed in it . Such ghosts , Herr Burn , such echoes of the past . Perfect atmosphere for a best-seller . <p> I would n't visit the damned bunker . But Yantarny , yes  --  I would go there on the very next day . At the source of amber I might find some better pointer . Back in the ear again , in our cocoon. amidst the pollution , Pavel explained that visits to Yantarny were a slightly sensitive matter . <p> " You see , foreigners can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special document . . . " <p> My heart sank . " Is it a military zone ? " <p> No , it was n't . Just along the coast at Baltiysk , was a huge naval base . Baltiysk was a restricted area  --  though nowadays sightseeing visits could even be arranged . For commercial reasons Yantarny was somewhat out of bounds to independent travelers . <p> " Somewhat out of bounds , " stressed Pavel . " I could drive you there , but it might be wiser to join a group tour . " <p> He would arrange this . He would accompany me . Even so , at Yantarny I would n't be able to visit the workings or the beach . Those were fully out of bounds . I would only be able to gawp at pipelines through which the quarried earth and amber were pumped across the town to be separated , and the amber cleaned . <p> Damnation . Still , did I really need to inspect those workings , like some commercial spy ? <p> I never did get to Yantarny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message was waiting for me  --  to telephone a certain number . <p> Did the proprietor of the amber shop have some new suggestion for my best-seller about sunken treasure ? Or , after a change of heart , was it the lady director of the museum who wanted to speak to me ? <p> Not in the least . It proved to be the older immigration officer , who had noted where I was staying . Would I meet him and some friends for a meal and drinks at a restaurant on Leninsky to discuss a matter of mutual interest ? But of course . And by the way , had I taken his young colleague 's advice regarding a chaperon ? Why yes , I had . In that case my minder must remain in the car . This matter was confidential . <p> The restaurant was very noisy due to the constant loud dance music . This entertainment rendered eavesdropping virtually impossible . It was n't merely face to face but almost nose to nose that I met Rylov the immigration officer , and Antonov , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Antonov was of the hefty breed . Fifty-eight inch chest and fifty inch waist , with a puce suit to match , crumpled though of decent tailoring . Mongol genes  --  and tissue courtesy of carbohydrate . He had to be a member of the Kaliningrad mafia . At first I thought that he was here as muscle , a bodyguard for the man with no name . In fact Antonov spoke English well , and was as much a part of this as Rylov or the Enigma . Mr. Mystery was in his seventies : dapper , with close-cropped silvery hair , and of refined features . The heavy tinted thick-lensed glasses he wore might have been due to weak eyes but they gave him the appearance of an aristocratic interrogator- though he left the interrogating to Antonov . He gave the appearance of understanding German and English but only spoke , from time to time , in Russian . During our encounter he smoked a dozen of those fragrant cigarettes consisting principally of a cardboard tube . <p> " So you believe that the pilot of a hang-glider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . <p> " Somewhere in the Carpathians , " I replied . Mr. Mystery sucked his cigarette then rapped out something in Russian . <p> The story which I 'd adopted bubbled forth . I was researching a thriller . <p> Antonov eyed me . " And the room shall appear nakedly out in the open ? Without any framework or corset to support it ? " <p> My dream inundated me . " It must . It has to . How else can the flier find it ? " <p> " Ah , " said Antonov . " And you are the flier . " <p> " I do fly , that 's true . " <p> His next remark amazed me . " Maybe it needs a special perception to find the room . " <p> I must have gaped at him . <p> Rylov said in halting English , " You not truly write novel . To write novel is a lie . You want to find the room . " The dance music bawled around me , isolating us in a mad oasis . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treasure value ? " <p> " No ! " <p> Because Amber fell from the sky . Because she beckoned me from within the golden room . I fingered my talisman . <p> " It 's a personal matter , " I said . " An emotional matter . " I hesitated before confessing : " I dream . I dream of finding it . " <p> " By magic , " said Antonov . I thought he was mocking me . Yet the next minute he began to discourse about the Third Reich and about psychics . For a while I imagined that he might be proposing a new plot for my phantom novel . Now that communism and state atheism had collapsed , was not occultism all the vogue in Russia ? <p> Accompanied by nods from Mr. Mystery , Antonov explained , " The Nazis persecuted most occultists , Mr. Burn , yet some they pampered . . . . " <p> Seemingly the German navy had financed a major scientific expedition to the Baltic in the hope of determining by radar the concave curvature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not deter the Naval Research Institute in Berlin from lavishing the finest wines and cigars upon psychics while those visionaries swung pendulums over charts of the Atlantic  --  this , in response to mounting losses of U-boats . And who knew what had been the upshot of the Nazi-sponsored psychic expedition to Tibet ? <p> The point of all this was that Antonov and his associates had evidence of a rite being performed within the amber room in Konigsberg Castle under the eye of Dr. Alfred Rohde and a high-ranking Nazi  --  with the aim of concealing the future whereabouts of the room . The otherworldly treasure would be hidden amidst mountains , of course  --  I was right on that account  --  but also in some veiled domain adjacent to the mundane world ... till someone of vision could rediscover it with suitable aid . <p> " The name of the doctor who poisoned Rohde and his wife was Erdmann , Mr. Bum . The name means Earthman , by contrast with the occult world of spirit . " Antonov leered at me , sweating . " And also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I asked , " did the Germans take such pains to hide the room ? " <p> " Why ? " Antonov 's tone proclaimed that the answer should be self-evident . Mr. Mystery was fingering the lapel of his own suit . I caught a flash of , yes , a double-headed eagle on a pin . This served as a signal to Antonov to initiate me . <p> " Because , " said the bulky fellow , " the amber room was once the glory of the Tsar 's Summer Palace , a symbol of Holy Russia , usurped by the Bolshevists . Nazis felt hatred for all Russians . The imperial Russian government fought the fathers of those Nazis in the First World War . . . " He did n't need to lower his voice due to the din of the music . " Mr. Burn , the rediscovery of the amber room heralds. . . the restoration of the Tsars . It will serve as a sure sign . " <p> Rylov nodded . Mr. Mystery exhaled blue smoke . In the logic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help us , Mr. Burn . We will help you fulfill your own private dream ! We know where to look , and we have the means to help you see . What we ask is that you buy the means from us , simply to help our funds . " He named a figure in Deutschmarks which corresponded with what Rylov already knew I had in my possession . <p> A seam . This had to be a seam . A confidence trick . <p> If I tried to walk out on them , would I be detained by a gun held covertly under the table ? Would I be robbed while Pavel sat patiently in the car outside ? Worse , might the music mask an actual pistol shot ? <p> Ah but this trio could n't be sure that the money was on me at the moment . . . <p> " Show me this means of yours , " I demanded . <p> Antonov frowned .

He is a criminal . " <p> I suppose his curiosity was justifiable in view of my mysteriously meeting with strangers within a day of my arrival in Kaliningrad . Did Pavel imagine that I was a criminal too ? Or that I was involved in the espionage game ? That my interest in amber was merely a front ? <p> " It 's all right , " I assured him . " Antonov offered to sell me some information about the amber room I 've been asking about . " <p> " Antonov is his real name , or at least it 's the name he uses . " <p> Ah . Wise Pavel . <p> " Did you recognize the old man with the glasses ? " <p> My minder shook his head . <p> " Pavel , tomorrow afternoon Antonov is coming to the hotel to bring me the information . I 'm suspicious this might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how picturesque the German word for confidence trick . " I want you to be with me when he ; visits . There 'll be some extra drink-money for you . " <p> We had crossed the ring-road by now , and in the darkness the ten floors of the Baltika loomed on our left . <p> My room was on the sixth floor . We 'd been waiting most of the afternoon . I was eyeing some wasteland through the smog-haze when a white Mercedes came into view , steering erratically at speed . The car barely missed a taxi and a bus before skidding to a halt , narrowly avoiding some German tourists . <p> A stout figure , unmistakably Antonov , lurched from the car . Clutching his side , he lumbered toward the entrance . Was he injured ? <p> Pavel and I were waiting by the elevator when Antonov spilled out . Luckily the corridor was deserted but for us . We had to heave Antonov along to my room , and into a dingy over-stuffed armchair . He 'd been shot . It seemed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't bleeding much at all . Not externally , at least . He 'd be bleeding inwardly . <p> I 'd seen Amber bleed inwardly to death , her outward form still fairly unblemished . . . <p> Antonov 's breath was ragged . " Seeing double , " he mumbled in English as he eyed me and Pavel . Pavel said something in Russian , and recognition dawned . " Bodyguard . . . Rylov said . . . " <p> " This is Pavel . Do n't worry . He does n't understand English . " <p> " You met your twin , Mr. Bum . . . There are affinities . . . Pavel is Paul , and you are Peter . Both saints attend me . " Mysticism was welling up in him along with his lifeblood . <p> What kind of confidence trick was this , if someone had shot Antonov to try to prevent him from coming to me ? <p> " What happened ? " I begged . <p> Blood bubbled on his lips , consecrating his words . <p> " Arguing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Hating foreigners ... Even if a foreigner does have the vision . . . " He coughed . " Wasting time . . . Look in the heart of the High Tatras , Mr. Burn . " <p> The High Tatras of Slovakia . . . <p> He whispered the name of a town , which I hastened to scribble on a pad . Antonov struggled to reach an inside pocket of his suit , and slid out a spectacle case made of steel . " Look with these . . . " <p> I opened the case . The spectacles were so old . The frames , sides , and ear-rests were of thin tarnished metal . Surely the lenses were of amber , though the amber was so clear and transparent . Apart from their evident age the spectacles looked remarkably like John Lennon glasses . <p> These were the means to find the amber room ? <p> " Man of the Konigsberg Guild made these , Mr. Burn . . . Christian Porschin . . . Sixteen-nineties . . . By heating amber gently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he resorted to German . " In Leinol . Blue flower , " he mumbled by way of explanation , though I was well aware what Leinol meant , namely linseed . Heat amber in linseed to clarify it  --  then grind lenses . <p> " Later on , Mr. Burn , the Nazi magic ceremony , remember . . . " <p> A ceremony to enchant the spectacles ? To attune them to the amber room ! When someone of vision wore these , he would be able to locate the lost room . . . <p> Maybe there had been something magical about these glasses even back in the late Seventeenth Century . Science and magic were still uneasy bedfellows back then . These spectacles had been safeguarded somewhere m the Kaliningrad region throughout the Soviet annexation , in this hard steel case  --  but not on behalf of covert Nazis . There could n't have been any Nazis lurking in the vicinity . Nearly all Germans had been killed or deported or sent to Siberia , right ? Covert Russian royalists had become the custodians . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rylov was a recruit to this crazy nationalist minority cause and that my quest seemed a godsend to the dotty Tsarists . <p> Though not to all of them ! Many of the newly liberated political animals must be deeply xenophobic . Holy Russia , sacred motherland : safeguard and restore her strength . Let not the West pollute the national soul . There 'd been a violent quarrel in the royalist faction . Certain members would have preferred a Rasputin to receive the specs , not a mere visitor from abroad . <p> Absolutely , this was no yokel-trap , not when it led to murder . Nor could I disbelieve in the spectacles . Too much faith , and death , had been invested in them . <p> " Blue flowers , " repeated Antonov , as if I might find the room in some high meadow full of blooms the hue of the sky itself . This was such an inconsequential detail , communicated with such urgency as thought began to dissipate from the brain . Almost like babbling of green fields . <p> Finally he slurred something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . Unsurprising that Antonov should revert to his mother tongue in the final moments  --  as any of us grown-ups might cry out , terminally , to the mother who bore us . Had those last words been a prayer ? <p> He was dead . Those high fatty cheeks slumped a little . Those eyes without any folds to the lids were blank . <p> I 'd imagined that the fall from the sky would kill Isabelle outright , mercifully and abruptly . She should have remained unconscious throughout her dying minutes . Surely she did not once open her eyes and focus upon me ! <p> Pavel was regarding the spectacles in perplexity . The only word of the conversation between myself and Antonov which he could have understood would have been Leinol . Linseed , and a pair of antique glasses . Why should I be willing to spend so much upon old specs ? How could those be the motive for a killing ? <p> " Help me get him out of here ! " I took out my wallet , and removed a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wo n't be needing money now . Here 's an installment on a tip for you . " Ein weniges Trinkgeld . Oh quite a lot . " There 'll be more to come , at the airport . " <p> After a quick recce , we heaved the body along to a tiny service room . Vacuum cleaner , linen , bars of soap . While I lurked , Pavel summoned the nearby elevator . The corridor remained deserted . The elevator arrived empty . While Pavel delayed the elevator , I dragged the body inside , then I hopped out  --  as did he , after pressing for the top floor . <p> " Wir haben Gluck , Herr Burn . . . " <p> Yes , we 'd been lucky , though we still needed to erase scuff marks from the carpet then wash some spots in my room and rub dirt in to restore their former appearance . Oh , and we reversed the cushions of the armchair . Antonov had n't bled much at all . Not externally . <p> The corpse would soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in these progressive days no KGB security men routinely haunted the lobby . And Antonov had known my room number in advance . <p> " By the way , " I asked casually , " what did he say in Russian at the very last ? " <p> Pavel grimaced . " It was stupid . Long live the Tsar , he said . " <p> I was hard put to conceal my elation at this final confirmation of Anton 's integrity , nevertheless I agreed that Antonov 's last words were completely Dummkopf . If Pavel still decided that I was a courier between royalists in Russia and in the West , why , be had more drink-money to look forward to , in return for his discretion ! <p> Oh , I 'd seen my love fall from the sky . And now I could find her again . <p> Where hang-gliders are concerned , there 's always a thin line between stability and instability ; and so it was with Amber too . <p> A cutting-edge craft which verges on being unstable is going to react @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a craft which is too stable is an exhausting drag to fly . A bit of instability has its merits . Amber had many merits . She was gorgeous , passionate , adventure-some . <p> Yet danger excited her rather too much . She courted the frisson . Not that she was a dangerous flier . She was too skilled to be dangerous . Skill vetoes silliness . Steering toward a thundercloud was n't her idea of a good time , but in her regular life she did risk thunder and lightning . <p> A cuckolded husband is often the last to know that he 's being cheated and betrayed and I was the last of a handful of accomplices in betrayal  --  the awkward thumb , as it were , since I was the closest to home . The awkward eager thumb . <p> Isabelle knew how to conduct a liaison , so she protested to me during the early weeks of our own affair . Did Max suspect anything at all about Simon Lee , her previous conquest ? Or about Jim Parrish , Lee 's predecessor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Parrish . Lee was a locally-based rally driver and dealer in sports cars . Parrish , it transpired , was a mushroom farmer and membership secretary of some federation of potholers . <p> Did knowledge of my own predecessors tarnish the craving I felt for her ? I suppose I was jealous and at the same time thrillingly flattered to be preferred to other men . <p> Cuckoldry is such an old-fashioned word for what I was doing to Max , but in view of our close relationship I found the term appropriate . Hitherto Isabelle had cheated  --  but her lovers were n't as close to Max as I was . Max , whose family 's money was our foundation . <p> Admittedly I had desired Isabelle previously . Yet I would n't have dreamed of doing anything . You might describe me as inhibited  --  notwithstanding my soaring ; dreams ! I had n't become intimate with a woman either at university or subsequently . At a. party I might tipsily and jokingly embrace some fellow I knew well  --  or an older woman acquaintance for whom I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whom I actually lusted . Displacement , that 's the name for it . <p> When my self-control finally slipped  --  was stripped away  --  by Isabelle , I did indeed succumb to erotic frenzy with her to an extent which surprised her , and delighted her . This delight risked being our undoing and the rain of Maxburn Airfoils . She began to muse about leaving humdrum Max for me . The frisson of flying had hitched her and Max together in the first place ( and I assume his future inheritance played a part ) , but he was n't fully able to satisfy her , so it seemed . Nor was motherhood an imminent goal . Bloated with child , how might she fly at the edge of possibility ? Pretense in public , frenzy in private ! <p> I remember us relaxing after love-making in the privacy of my cottage which I 'd renamed The Wings . The place was secluded . Woodland , on most sides . A shady lane gave quiet access . The Wings consisted of a south wing and a west wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Amber 's golden sun-lamp tan left no pale loin-stripe . Blonde bloom upon her skin , as on a firm sweet fruit . Those amber areolas and the succulent beads of her nipples . Freckles on her upper arms and shoulders . Her slim nose , her restless blue eyes framed with challenging violet shadow . She wore her flaxen hair in a long braided rope , bating her brow , offering me a kind of tail to hold . <p> I was , in our pillow talk , The Thumb . The Thumb would jut stiffly , throbbing to hitch a ride . <p> " Thumb 's up , " she would say . " Thumb 's up . " This was to be her joke  --  risque and risky  --  whenever we were setting out to fly , me and her and Max each with our separate sails . <p> On this occasion I remember her speculating whether two people could possibly make love aloft , high in the sky , veiled by a cloud , whilst flying tandem side by side together . Would the hang-straps make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How wildly would bodily movements pitch the craft ? She laughed , she laughed . <p> " I 's like to go on holiday to Zanzibar , " she said . " Nobody else seems to go there . Max is n't interested . " <p> " Well , the two of us can hardly slip away to Zanzibar together . " <p> " I suppose not . I just want to go somewhere where I 'm invisible . " " I think you 'd be very visible in Zanzibar . " <p> " Somewhere which is my own secret place . And yours . " <p> " We 're in it at this moment , are n't we ? " <p> " Jim made love to me in a cave . " <p> I did n't wish to hear about my predecessors . <p> Isabelle was nominally a silversmith . She had trained thus , indulged by her parents . Courtesy of Max she had a little workshop kitted out with drills and cutters and melting pot , blast burner and drawbench , hammers , burnishers and buffers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect little hang-gliders to dangle down from one 's lobes , sails brushing the wearer 's neck like silver insects . She had made life-size slim silver ears to hang underneath one 's flesh-and-blood ears . Was this wit or sheer caprice ? Expensive toys gave her a pretext to hang out at swanky craft fairs and be admired , and meet such as Simon and Jim . <p> She began to nag at going away with me . <p> Going away ? Away from my life ? <p> * * * <p> Another time , at The Wings , I told her about the amber room  --  and immediately there was a place in which we ought to make love . To surprise her , on the next sunny afternoon I pinned golden cellophane over the bedroom window . Was my light-fitting an adequate substitute for a chandelier ? Could the carpet become a parquet floor of red . and gold and caramel ? The only amber was round my neck . And beside me , in bed ! Amber 's skin hardly needed any tinting by cellophane , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Yes , we trod such a thin line between stability and instability , If Max discovered , what a wreckage of my once-stable life there would be . Did this possibility stimulate Isabelle ? Whilst in The Wings , my own self-control evaporated , If the collapse of control were to spread further , involving Maxburn Airfoils in disorder , what then ? <p> Amber said to me , " Of course , if Max had a flying accident I 'd feel so wretched and so sad . Worse , you and I could hardly continue loving . If we did , the finger of suspicion would point . Yet how could we stop loving ? That 's why I 'm sure we should go away . Why not to America  --  where they surf the sky ? " <p> Financially this seemed deeply impractical . Was I to set up shop all over again ? Was I to work with designers who might have a veto over me ? Isabelle would be deserting her check book in the process of deserting Max . Was I to provide her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Perils of cuckoldry . Terror tiptoed along my spine , Thumbs down . <p> I had no particular trouble leaving Kaliningrad . The murder had obviously been due to a gangland feud . In spite of the manifest lack of pursuit , the victim must have been trying to hide himself in the hotel  --  rather than having any special business at the Baltika . The Baltika was certainly not paying any protection money to racketeers . Nyet , nein , absolutely not , <p> Nor did any xenophobic tsarists try to hinder me on the way from boarding the Warsaw-bound plane . <p> Nor was my hang-glider stolen by Polish spivs on the road south by way of Krakow . <p> Guards on the Slovak side of the border with Poland were mainly on the lookout for cheap Polish cigarettes and for migrant Romanians  --  particularly for gypsy Romanians trying to reach the Shangri-La of Germany . Myself and Range Rover and hang-glider passed muster ; thus I entered the heart of the High Tatra mountains . I was soon at a certain pleasant resort town crowded with tourists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thawing on all southerly slopes the skiing season was over  --  yet the swelter and thunderstorms of high summer were still a couple of months away . Apart from a lingering chill , this was a fine time to admire towering white peaks and ramble and climb a bit and sup strong Tatra beer . Many Germans were doing so . <p> Up aloft , the air would be bitter . Even in summer the higher slopes only warmed to a few degrees above zero . Visibility should n't be a bother . During full summer the sky would cloud over almost every morning , prelude to thunder and lightning by midday , with clear sky only from late afternoon onwards . But not as yet . <p> I had to visit the nearest flying ground of the Slovak Aeroclub to present my credentials . The amber room might be invisible , but I would n't be . I had to demonstrate my sail and my : skills , finesse a permit , sign a waiver , take out an expensive insurance bond in case the Mountain Rescue Service needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the backs of mountains , to flee at the sight of any thundercloud forming to conduct myself sensibly . <p> In the hotel where I stayed , vegetables seemed almost entirely absent from meals . Duck with bread dumplings ; pork with bacon dumplings . Had these people never heard of a pea or a carrot ? Ah , explained a waiter , former Communist mismanagement of agriculture was to blame . I imagined innumerable fields devoted to a monoculture of dumpling bushes . <p> Isabelle would have liked it here . My Amber was a flesh-eater . <p> She certainly did n't bite or scratch when we quarrelled about the idea of her leaving Max , Rather , she hugged and caressed herself , not like some wounded animal. , but more as though she was making love to herself before my estranged eyes  --  becoming almost oblivious to me , inhabiting some domain dominated by her own senses , exhibiting a radical selfishness which chilled and shocked me more than rage would have done . I should feel compelled to reach out and promise anything whatever if only she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could she , who was usually so out-going , suddenly go inward thus ? I felt that there was a madness in her  --  not the mad of anger , of a whim denied , of desire denied , but the mad of unreason . <p> This was n't the Amber whom I had known hitherto . Maybe here was proof that she did truly love me with a consuming passion , a passion which , nonetheless , she had chosen to experience for the frisson of it  --  a passion by which I must in turn fatally be captivated . ( And I was , I was ; so why was I denying her ? ) <p> That afternoon she departed more like a sleepwalker than a woman incensed . <p> I know that that same night I dreamed forebodingly of driving the several miles to the airfoil shed and doing such-and-such to one of the cutting-edge craft by torchlight , by dreamlight . In a dream details are elusive . Spurred by trauma , my subconscious mind must have intuited a structural flaw in the newest design . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isabelle was all smiles . Water under the bridge . <p> On the low hilltop from which we liked to launch , Max and I both observed her closely as she warmed up and stretched to loosen her body . Kneeling she strapped in and hooked up . Hang-check , harness check . From the nose-wire a thread of red yarn fluttered , reading the breeze . Hands on the uprights of the control bar , she stood up under sail . She stared well ahead then ran at top speed . She was airborne into the wind rising up the hillside . Perfect . <p> I was rising over ascending spruce trees . Look : a family of deer down below ! <p> Above , a few patches of cirrocumulus spread wispy fans like lacy bleached corals , tinted faintly by my amber spectacles . I still felt overheated in my thermal underclothes and woolens and gloves and anorak . Well and good ! I 'd be shivering soon . <p> Soon enough , spruce was yielding to dwarf pines . As I gained more altitude the pines thinned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never flies the ground , one flies the air . Soon the air was chili , but chill air must still lift over hills , over soaring heights , because of catabatic convection flow . Earlier , occasional poles had marked tracks . No longer , up above the bushline . Earlier , I 'd seen dozens of hikers . Now it was as if the whole world had emptied , or as if an alternative world had replaced the previous one . An azure mountain lake on my left . Was some ice still afloat there ? I left the lake behind . <p> A pulse thudded in the pendant tucked above my heart . I found myself looking in vain for blue flowers amidst the snow and cliffs . <p> In a ravine , through my antique specs , at last I perceived the room  --  aglow and entire and golden amidst bald boulders with snowy beards and snowy ruffs . Lifting a hand from the control bar , I thrust up my glasses briefly . Of course the room hid itself , chameleon that it was , phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw it again so clearly . By a shift of perception , through its ceiling I spied the chandeliers hanging downward almost like reflections . No corset sustained the room nor did any betraying litter of discarded crates lie around  --  of course not . The room was radiance as much as reality . <p> Almost , I hesitated . Almost , I fled from the mountains back to the world of a Range Rover and The Wings ; , the empty Wings , and Max , coping bravely with grief . But my dreams were welling in me , replacing actuality with a more exquisite mode of being . <p> I began a figure-eight descent , to and fro within the ravine . I intended to alight with a final decisive flare alongside the room . Whether down-gusts buffeted me or the magnetism of so much amber pulled me like a leaf , I found myself swooping down upon the ceiling  --  surely to shatter it . <p> Not so , not so . I sprawled upon the amber parquet floor . Above me the allegorical ceiling was intact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window I saw my sail being borne up and away out of the ravine by wind like a great bird set free . <p> Scrambling to my feet , I tore off gloves and harness and anorak . It was warm within the room . Within , within ! I was inside the treasure room where tsars had stood . <p> Unable to focus upon any single particular , I scanned the wall mosaics and all the intricate carvings of trees and garlands and shells . So many scenes of nature , so many Gods and Goddesses and other personae . How the faceted amber drops of the chandeliers twinkled . How brightly the clear red plaques shone amidst surrounding yellows and browns . In the giant gilt-framed mirrors at either end of the room I saw myself receding toward infinity . Three windows reached to the floor , their frames richly carved . . . <p> Already the ravine had vanished . Dense mist stroked those windows . Condensation trickled . A cloud had nestled down so quickly . Nothing was visible outside . <p> There were three doors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one but it would n't budge . Nor would the next . Nor the third . <p> Amber . Where was she ? <p> Why , there she was in one of the mirrors  --  standing alongside one of my more distant reflections ! Isabelle was dressed in the same jeans and black polo-neck sweater as on the day she had died . Her flaxen rope of hair hung forward over one shoulder and down her breast , suggestive of a noose not yet knotted . Her expression was weird . She took a step forward . <p> She did not give rise in the mirror to multiples of herself . She was the one and only . When I glanced back , she was n't present in the other mirror at all . <p> She had advanced again . Now she was only four reflections away from me . Could she see me here in the gleaming room ? <p> " Why did you kill me ? " she called out , stepping closer . " Why , Peter , why ? " <p> " I dreamed that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have done so ? How could I ? " <p> I had strayed closer to the mirror . She was so near to me now . She shook her head at my answer . The flaxen rope swung . <p> " Look around me , " I begged . " It 's the amber room . " All the decorations to admire ! All the allegories to decode ! <p> I was still wearing my antique spectacles , bewitched by some psychic whilst Hitler 's empire of death distintegrated . If I snatched the specs off , would she evaporate  --  and the treasure room too ? Would there only be ravine , and a cold hill 's side ? <p> Could I embrace her in here , one last forgiving and delirious time ? I opened my arms in tentative invitation . She stepped toward me , smiling eerily , the rope of hair slack in her hands . She was intending to loop it around my neck to exact the perfect revenge inside this locked room ! The means of death would completely elude any deduction . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her accusing eyes upon me . <p> What I experienced was the perfusion of myself by another being , by the total essence of another , in a way that surely no other lovers had ever encountered before . I was Isabelle herself , full of memories other than Peter 's . <p> Yet already this essence was being peeled away , emptying me of her so that only half of myself seemed to remain . I fought in vain to remember a tiny fraction of this ephemeral stupendous event . It had been as though a God , or a Goddess , had entered me briefly , granting me a whole extra life filled with incidents and passions . I had not encountered death but its opposite : a doubling of all my days ! <p> Gone from me already , in a robbery absolute , a devastating theft ! <p> Amber was n't in the room . She was in the other mirror . Her back was to me now . She was pacing away along the line of my reflections . <p> " Isabelle , come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became . Impossible to see her any longer . Only me , and me , and me . <p> She had never even been in the room with me in physical form . Only her essence had passed through the room , and through me , astonishing me with the fullness of a life I had quenched , then abandoning me utterly . Oh this should be the room where murderers were locked , in so elegant a hell ! How I wept for myself , and my reflections wept with me . <p> When I took off the glasses , the room remained . Those doors would n't open . Those windows were blanketed by cloud  --  nor would they break . <p> I saw her fall from the sky . The failed hang-glider had begun to spin like a sycamore leaf . . . <p> I must have been eleven when I first began to dream of flying . . On the way through Immigration an encounter occurred . . . <p> Thus it was that I acquired Pavel as my minder . . . <p> Neither hunger nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , but after each reliving one of my reflections disappeared from one of the two great mirrors . Initially the queues still looked much the same , but as time repeated itself those queues began visibly shortening . <p> Now only three reflections remain in one mirror , and two in the other . After five more relivings I shall be on my own . <p> I live entirely for the brief moment of her passing at the very end of each repetition , of which I always fail to embrace a thousandth part . She wells within me ; then the well runs dry . <p> When my last reflection vanishes , I shall lie down upon the lustrous parquet floor . I shall close my eyes and blindly await , at last , the tangible brush of her rope of hair across my throat . Then I shall truly be joined with her in death . <p> It ca n't be that she wo n't come ! It ca n't be that I shall simply stay here in the room of my , dreams with no image of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin . <p> All has gone . Only the more . remains . I shall lay me down . First I shall strip myself , commencing with the pendant . <p> But wait ! <p> In Gran-Annie 's bead I spy myself . I gesture , and the minuscule Peter gestures . <p> I 'm lying on the parquet floor , motionless , tiny , surrounded by amber . <p> Please pick me up , Isabelle . Please wear me . Wear me in whatever realm you inhabit now . <p> <p> <p> By Ian Watson <p> Ian Watson 's " The Amber Room " provided the inspiration for Stephen Gervais 's cover .
