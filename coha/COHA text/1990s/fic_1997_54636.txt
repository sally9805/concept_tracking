But as this story reminds us , the biggest pests do n't usually go away just by swatting at them ... What struck me first about Benny Clay were the dead mosquitoes . The rest of us would sit in the dugout slapping and scratching while Benny would sit on the bench , hands on his knees , as relaxed as if he.were home watching Leave It to Beaver . We 'd end up with bites ; Benny would end up with dead mosquitoes hanging all over him . Limp legs . Limp wings . Limp whatever . It was really something to see . <p> " I think it 's my blood , " he explained . " They start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happened with a bee , too . Right here , " he said , poking himself in a stain of freckles . " I did n't even know I had a bee in me till Miss Caprice told me to go wash my face . " Miss Caprice had been his grade five teacher in wherever he lived before he moved to Howell . He had mentioned the town a couple of times , but it was n't interesting enough for me to bother remembering . In fact , I did n't give much thought to any of the towns Benny mentioned . He had lived in a lot of dull places , some even duller than Howell . <p> Benny wanted to be a second baseman . Trouble was , he could n't field or hit worth a darn . Coach Ragemeyer said he was afraid of the ball . He shut his eyes every time a grounder shot his way and bailed out at the plate , even if the pitch was a mile outside . " You 're worse than a girl , Clay ! Maybe we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly what a lot of the kids did . Strange thing was , it did n't seem to bother him any worse than the mosquitoes did . I 'd never met anyone quite like him . <p> " How come nothing seems to bug you , Benny ? " I asked him one day , a couple of innings after Coach Ragemeyer tore into him for letting another grounder scoot between his legs . <p> " Stuff bothers me all right , but there 's nothing I can do about it , so I keep my feelings inside . " <p> " Wish I could do that , " I said . ' I usually say something dumb  --  and then get jumped on . " <p> " I know , " Benny said . " I could n't believe it when you stood up to Gilpin . He really belted you , did n't he ? " Gilpin was a big jerk catcher for the Briarwood Braves . He was about the only kid in the league who wore spikes . He stressed the fact by leaving his mark every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warned him that if he tried it with me , I 'd make him eat his glove . Well , he did , and I did n't . <p> I was small for my age , and , I guess , my brain must have matched . If only my mouth had , too . Next to baseball , getting beaten up seemed to be my favorite pastime . <p> I rolled up my right pant leg . " If you look real close , you can still see where the bugger bit me after he spiked me . And under here , " I raised my shirt , " is where he clawed me . You 'd think a kid that big would n't have to fight dirty , but he does . " <p> " Did he do that , too ? " Benny asked , pointing to the yellow bruise on my shoulder , just where my neck gets started . <p> " Nah ! That 's from the Skyler game and Evans . " <p> " Figures . Evans has used his elbow on me a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play like that . " <p> I spun around and showed Benny my back . " Here 's where he kicked me after he knocked me down . " <p> " You ever win a fight , Brian ? " <p> " Not yet . But I will , " I said . " I 'll get back at them some day . I hate bullies . Hate their guts . " <p> " I hate them , too , " Benny said . " But I 'm not going to mix it up and get hurt even worse . If Evans wants to elbow me , I do n't care , as long as he does n't do anything else . When guys like him and Gilpin start up with me , I try to make myself invisible . " <p> " Does it work ? " <p> " Sometimes , I think . " <p> " How can you tell ? " <p> " When they do n't hit me a second time . " <p> " Maybe I should try that , " I said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I joined him . " Yeah ! It would n't hurt . " <p> " Still , you 're lucky , Brian . " <p> " Lucky ? Me ? " <p> " At least , you can play ball . I stink . Coach says you could go right to the top if you put your mind to it . Says you 're the best shortstop he 's seen in years . " <p> " Ragemeyer 's an asshole . Only reason he coaches is so he can sell life insurance to our parents . Anyhow , that 's what Billy says . " Billy was the coach 's son . <p> It was then we struck the deal . I 'd teach Benny how to play ball and he 'd teach me how to be invisible . <p> First thing I taught him was to stop wearing shirts with red and white stripes running across . " Fat kids should n't wear them , Benny . Makes you look like that tub in the Dubble Bubble comics . " <p> No wonder Benny wore Huskies . His father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down the coast . The first time Benny showed me his cellar , I felt like Hansel and Gretel must have when they stumbled into the witch 's house . The floor was cluttered with teetering cases of 12s , 24s , 36s and 48s , plastered with names like Hershey 's and Topps and Mars and Tootsie , while huge jars of goodies strutted across the walls and tabletops . Jelly beans . Jujubes . Blackballs . Wax lips . Honeymoons . Marshmallow bunnies . Licorice pipes . Candy cigarettes . <p> Benny would check in with his parents a few times a day and I 'd tag along . It paid off . When his father was in town , he 'd stuff our pockets with jawbreakers , sunflower seeds , peanuts  --  you name it . All for free , too . <p> His mother would pour us fresh lemonade , pink for Benny , white for me . It was something I never understood . At my house , if I was having pink lemonade , my friends would get it , too . Usually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hires . <p> Anyhow , most of the time , the kitchen visits went like this : <p> " Being Benny 's friend pays dividends , does n't it ? " His mother would smile , lips tight , as if she were holding in her front teeth . <p> I would nod . I was n't sure what dividends were , but I sensed she knew what she was talking about . <p> " But you must not be Benny 's friend just for the treats , you know ? That would make you a false friend . The Bible says that false friends go straight to Hell . And you would not want that to happen , would you ? You are going to watch out for Benny , are n't you ? " <p> Watch out for him ? Jesus ! He was twice my size . What did she expect me to do ? I would shake my head . It was plain to me that more than a few of Benny 's ex-friends were on their way to Hell at that very moment . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and I promise he will watch out for you . Now , would you like another nice glass of lemonade , Brian ? " <p> " Could I please have the pink this time , like Benny , Mrs. Clay ? " <p> " No , you can not , " she would say . <p> Once , I asked Benny why his mother would never let me have the pink lemonade . " Some day , she might , " he answered . <p> I preferred Benny 's father . He did n't talk so much . And he did n't hold back on any candies . <p> Although-the fringe benefits of Benny 's friendship were nice , the in-betweens were no piece of cake  --  or , for that matter , handful of jujubes . Teaching Benny was only slightly easier than , maybe , calling up a girl . Or convincing Miss Cooke that Snapper really did pee on my homework . <p> Ragemeyer was right . Benny was afraid of the ball . Pain terrified him . <p> " Believe me , Benny , the fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd heard the line in a movie . <p> " That 's what the guys who dish out the pain always say , " Benny replied . <p> " We 'll start with a punch for a punch , " I said . <p> " Huh ? " <p> " I 'll punch you in the arm and then you 'll punch me . We keep going until one of us shouts ' uncle . ' " <p> " Uncle , " Benny shouted . <p> " We have n't started yet , " I said . " You first . You hit me first . " <p> Something brushed my arm . <p> " Was that it ? " I asked . <p> " Uh-huh . " <p> " Jesus , Benny , you got to punch harder than that . I barely felt it . " <p> " I do n't like to punch . It hurts my hand . " <p> " Have it your way . But now it 's my turn . " <p> He shut his eyes and scrunched up his mouth till his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick jab on the shoulder . It was hard , but no way near my best shot . <p> " Uncle ! " Benny shouted . " Uncle , uncle , uncle , uncle , uncle , uncle , " he yelped , hopping about like a toad on a heated trash can cover . ( I know , because we 'd heated up a trash can cover and tossed a toad on just the summer before . I never forgot what it looked like . ) <p> As for Benny 's part , he probably did n't find teaching me all that easy either . <p> His philosophy was simple . " Sticks and stones will break my bones , but keeping my mouth shut will never hurt me . " <p> " I 've never heard that version before , " I said . <p> " It 's the right version , " he assured . " Keeping your mouth shut works two ways . First , the bullies are n't likely to notice you . And second , if they do start roughing you up , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go away . Usually , before they do too much damage . " <p> " So if I start getting punched out , I should n't say a word ? Just let them do it to me ? " <p> " Uh-huh . They 'll finish with you a lot quicker . " <p> " Gee , I do n't know if I could do that . If somebody 's hitting me , I 've got to hit back . " <p> " The trick is not to get hit in the first place . That 's why keeping your mouth shut right from the start is so important . It makes you invisible . " <p> In the next game against Briarwood , Gilpin hit a double off the tip of Benny 's glove . It was the closest Benny had come to stopping a ball all season . Nonetheless , I could hear Ragemeyer cursing , raging like a circus geek on the top step of the dugout . <p> Rounding first , Gilpin spied Benny lumbering over to cover second . " Out of my way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benny 's gut as he pulled up at the base . <p> Both benches roared hilarious approval . Both benches ! ( I guess that should n't have surprised me . Fostering team spirit had never been one of Ragemeyer 's strengths . ) " Laaaaaa-rrrrrrd boy , " they laughed . " Laaaaaa-rrrrrrd boy . " Encouraged , Gilpin body-checked Benny out toward center field . Benny tripped over his own heels and landed flat on his butt . He did n't say a word . But he sure was n't invisible . Not to me , anyhow . <p> Gilpin shrugged . Then turned to me at short . <p> " Well , if it is n't the wise ass  --  the short short ! Seems to me I got some unfinished business with you , " he said , pounding right fist into left palm . <p> I began to swallow my lower lip and a good part of my chin . <p> " Better stay out of my way , you little shrimp , or I 'm going to bury you under third . " <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kick in . I knew Benny was watching . <p> " What 's the matter , loser , too chicken to face me man to man ? " <p> My glove missed him by a good two yards . His first punch caught me in the gut , so hard I think his fist bounced off the front of my backbone . I do n't remember where his second landed . <p> " And you were doing so well , " said Benny . <p> By the first week of June , Benny no longer closed his eyes when the ball came his way . By the third week , he was able to stop most grounders , usually with his body if not with his glove . Suddenly , Benny understood that a braise could be a badge of honor . By the end of the month , he was handling almost everything except line drives and real high infield pops . He did n't have much speed or range , could n't turn the double play for beans , but he was still playing an acceptable second base . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , Jennies were few and far between . <p> As for me , I 'd managed to stay out of fights for over a month . We faced the Braves and Gilpin two times in that period , and the Skyler Sox , with Evans , three times , but I did n't let them bait me . I kept working on making myself invisible , keeping my mouth shut . Of course , Coach Ragemeyer benched me for a lot of those innings . " I hate to waste my best shortstop , but you 're too damn scrappy , Brian , " he said . " I ca n't take a chance on one of those boys maiming you . At least , " he grinned , " until your folks take a policy out on you . " <p> When it came to July , however , Ragemeyer could n't afford to leave me out of the lineup . Two more games , and we needed them both to claim a playoff spot . And would n't you know it , the two were against Briarwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Surprise . Five days before the Briarwood game , Mrs. Clay poured me a glass of pink lemonade . <p> I could n't believe it . <p> " You have earned this , " she said . " You have been a true friend to Benny . " <p> " Yeah , I have , " I said , just to make sure she would n't forget the fact . <p> " Drink up . There is a lot more where this came from , " she promised . <p> It looked like pink lemonade . It smelled like pink lemonade . It tasted like pink lemonade . But it did n't go down like pink lemonade . It washed over my tongue , seemed to hesitate , then drifted past my tonsils , dallying , taking its time , slow and easy , coating as it crept , not a bit eager to reach my belly . It was cold , and quenching , and delicious ( the best I 'd ever tasted ) , but , strangely , it left my insides warm and fuzzy  --  all of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . <p> " It feels funny , " I said . <p> Benny shrugged . <p> " Like it goes down extra slow or something , " I said , tipping my glass for the final drops , letting the ice cubes tap against my teeth . <p> " My mother sweetens it with something like honey . " <p> " Oh ? " I nodded . <p> Mrs. Clay refilled my glass . <p> I can not say how many glasses of Mrs. Clay 's pink lemonade I drank that week , but it was a lot . I guess I was making up for lost time . <p> We had an early two run lead , but Briarwood tied it up in the third on three hits , followed by an error by Benny . Gilpin led the ragging for the Braves . Every insult any fat kid ever endured must have been fired Benny 's way in that inning alone . Still , he stood his ground , invisible like always . I had to hand it to him . He might have been the biggest chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , too . <p> I 'm sure Ragemeyer would have taken Benny out then and there , but the League rules would n't allow it . Every kid had to play a minimum number of innings . Prior to game time , the Briarwood coach had informed the league commissioner that the Clay boy  --  " that load of blubber who plays second "  --  was way under the minimum . Benny would have to play every remaining inning for Howell , including any playoff games , just to break even . When he heard the ruling , Coach Ragemeyer bit the button off his cap and almost choked to death . Billy whacked him on the back with his first base glove and the button shot clear across the infield . <p> We got the go-ahead run in the fifth , but the Braves came right back with two more in their half . Benny made another error that inning , but the run had already scored . Even though the error did n't matter , the abuse flew something terrible . Fathead . Lardass . Fatso . Pansy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fat-ass . Ass-man . Blubber boy . Craphead . And , yet again , Jenny Jenny Jenny Jenny . Our bench and the other guys in the field joined right in . " Shut up , " I shouted . " He 's doing his best . " But nobody heard me , except Benny . <p> What bothered me most was that Benny was actually playing a pretty decent game . He had made quite a few nice stops and came close on a couple of double plays . Even caught a pop-up , the kind he usually ran the wrong way from . So when he hit the first double of his life in the top of the ninth to put the tying run in scoring position , I could n't have been happier . So what if it would 've been a triple for most runners ? This was pretty darn special . Nobody was calling Benny names then . In fact , it was the first time I 'd ever heard Benny being cheered . It felt so good , I thought I was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head quickly enough . Being Benny 's friend had hurt my reputation enough . Crying would 've finished me for good . <p> There were two out when Billy Ragemeyer came to the plate . He swung on the first pitch and lofted a leaky fly ball to medium right . That should have been the game , but the Braves messed up . They must have thought it was going to drop foul ; no one made an effort to reel it in . It landed a good foot fair . Everybody seemed to freeze from the shock , and then Coach Ragemeyer started hollering " Run , Clay , run . " <p> Benny was plodding round third by the time the right fielder got to the ball . Even way over in the first base dugout we could hear his breathing . It reminded me of a wounded wart hog I 'd seen in one of those boring nature movies from Disney  --  Wart Hog Wonders of Wallawallaland or something . <p> He was halfway home before the ball was airborne . That 's when Gilpin snapped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saucer right into Benny 's face . But Benny rumbled on with barely a misstep . He kept on coming , blood streaming out of what had been his nose . <p> " Attaboy , Clay ! " Coach Ragemeyer cried . <p> " Go , Benny , " I shouted . <p> Then Gilpin caught Benny with a spike on the shin and an elbow to the throat , and my friend went down like a sack of mashed potatoes . Gilpin straddled him , his face knotted up meaner than I 'd ever seen it , as the pitcher ran the ball the final few feet . <p> Coach Ragemeyer argued interference , but the umpire would hear none of it . Not surprising , considering we were the visiting team and the ump probably wanted to keep his job at the Briarwood tire plant , the outfit that just happened to sponsor the Braves . <p> Gilpin held the ball in his hand till Benny came to , and with a big , poison grin , he leaned down , put the ball to Benny 's chin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It was this moment that Benny chose not to be invisible . He exploded into Gilpin , a sputtering , flailing mass of fists and phlegm . But nothing seemed to land as hard as it should or in any place it could do much damage . For a spell , it looked like Benny was trying to shove his nose into Gilpin 's mouth , but Gilpin would have none of it . A blow . A feint . A jab . A twist . And Gilpin was behind him , Benny 's head deflating in the crook of Gilpin 's arm . " I want to hear you cry ' uncle , ' Fatso . Or I 'm going to twist your fat little skull right off your fat little neck . " <p> I must have leaped out of the dugout , over the field and onto Gilpin 's back in a single stride . I wrapped my arms around his neck and wrenched with every bit of my weight . Benny hit the ground and rolled to safety , and there I was , riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for broke . No matter which way he turned , I turned with him . He tried wracking me off against the backstop . He tried flipping me over his head . He tried shaking me loose by roiling across the on-deck circle . He tried prying my fingers apart one by one . But nothing worked . Nothing was going to work . And then , at home plate , he sank his teeth into my arm . <p> A fleshy , bloody and hungry bite . <p> A bite that dug for bone . <p> All right , I admit my eyes got teary ; I could n't help it . It hurt so bad . Finally , I had nothing left . I slid down his back , feet first , onto the plate , and waited for the worst that was sure to come . <p> It was one of those moments you read about , the kind that seem to last forever . <p> I wobbled on my heels , staring up at him , my arm in his mouth , my blood dripping from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swaying just a little , his teeth in my arm , his lips and chin oozing with my blood . I wanted to back away , but could n't . He did n't look like he was planning on moving anywhere . The only sound was his nostrils , humming hoarsely , sputtering feebly , until there was no sound at all . <p> I realized then that Gilpin was hanging from my outstretched arm . <p> Limp legs . <p> Limp arms . <p> Limp mouth . <p> I shuddered , shook , shook again . My arm fell free , and the Briarwood Braves ' catcher crumpled onto home plate . <p> I vaguely remember somebody saying , ' @'I think he 's dead . " And Coach Ragemeyer helping me to the bench with : " You 're going to need stitches , and probably some shots or something . It 's a shame your parents did n't listen and buy the accident coverage I told them to . " <p> Benny sent a basket to the hospital for me . It was packed with all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avenue , six licorice pipes , a couple of strawberry whips , a wad of suckers , some loose jellybeans , and , poking up through the center , a big , red thermos of pink lemonade . <p> Dear Brian , <p> My mother always says that sooner or later bullies bite off more than they can chew . <p> Thanks for being the best friend I ever had . <p> Your friend always , <p> Benny Clay <p> P.S. Do n't drink it all at once . It keeps almost forever and a little goes a long way . <p> I never did see Benny again . The story was that his father had been transferred to another town with a name I ca n't recall . <p> The police got involved and some medical guy came down from the state capital . My parents were pretty worried . I heard from more than a few people that I might have to go to reform school or something , even though I had n't done anything . But all that ended when word came out that Gilpin had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I bought the line along with everyone else . In fact , I believed it until the following spring when I began to notice the mosquitoes on my arm . Dead . Just hanging there . <p> Of course , it upset me for a bit . Then I pulled the thermos closer and checked the schedule to see when the Skyler team and Evans were coming to town . <p> <p> By Michael Libling <p> Michael Libling is new to the science fiction field , but he 's not new to the writing world .
