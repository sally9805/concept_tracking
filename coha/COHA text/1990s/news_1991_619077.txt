<p> With almost nowhere to park in their neighborhood , a San Francisco couple recently sold one of their two cars . Now , the maddening experience of parking is driving the husband and wife to move . <p> " It takes me a half-hour to get home from my job in Corte Madera , " said Bayandor Farivar , who lives with his wife in the Mission District . " Then I have to spend another half-hour every day trying to find a place to park . We 've had it . " <p> He and his wife are now hunting for an apartment for three  --  the two of them and a guaranteed garage space for their Mazda RX-7 . <p> Thousands of frustrated drivers have devised other solutions that are drastic , costly or illegal in order to park in car-crammed San Francisco . Autos block sidewalks , occupy bus zones , fill driveways and crosswalks as never before . The wealthy hollow out new garages in the undersides of old homes , and others live by their wits and dodge a growing number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $ 27 million-a-year Department of Parking and Traffic in 1988 to coordinate the city 's empire of garages , meter minders and traffic plans . But with nearly a half-million vehicles squeezed into the city 's 49 square miles , there is no way to handle the parking problem comfortably . <p> " It 's an unmitigated disaster , " said Ray King , former head of San Francisco 's Parking Authority , which ran public garages before the new department was created . The city is swamped with cars , trucks and motorcycles , he said . " We just do n't have enough room to put them all . " <p> Under tough-minded Rina Cutler , the director of the new superagency to handle parking and traffic ills , the city has edged toward an unspoken policy of strict enforcement of parking laws to hem in frustrated drivers who will park almost anywhere . <p> The city has also announced modest plans to ease the pain with more public garages in neighborhood shopping areas , diagonal parking in place of nose-to-tail curb slots , and shorter stalls to match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But city parking experts still believe that the key to better parking may be the ticket under the wiper  --  or worse . There are 280 parking control officers , up by more than a hundred from several years ago . City Hall has ordered more bright yellow Denver boot devices , which immobilize the cars of scofflaw drivers who have run up 10 or more parking tickets without paying . <p> The drastic steps are based on numbers . During the past 15 years , the number of vehicles registered in the city has jumped 29 percent to more than 464,000 , and the number continues to grow daily . <p> Add the vehicles that are not yet registered in San Francisco and others registered out of town where insurance rates are lower , and the resulting density is now well over 10,000 cars , trucks , campers and motorcycles per square mile , the worst in the United States with the exception of Boston , according to experts . <p> And these figures do not include the estimated 200,000 or more autos flooding into San Francisco each weekday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The situation has become so intolerable that at least one citizen has evoked San Francisco 's 1800s vigilante tradition to deal with it . <p> At a recent meeting of the Parking and Traffic Commission , a soft-spoken real estate agent named Rick Thurber threatened to start citing cars himself , with the help of an ad hoc community group . He said he and others in the group plan to print and distribute parking tickets that duplicate the city 's , complete with authentic- looking envelopes so the fines will go directly to the city 's treasury . <p> " That 's a felony , " objected commissioner Arnold Chin . <p> " It 's a felony what 's happening here , " shot back Thurber , arguing that the city has neglected the neighborhoods and concentrated enforcement in the downtown and tourist areas . <p> Thurber said his group plans to have the tickets printed early next year . " People have no qualms about where they park anymore , " he said brandishing photos of autos parked on sidewalks , in parks and across bus zones and crosswalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life here , and we 'll just have to take matters into our own hands . " <p> Yet for every irate citizen like Thurber there are at least as many angry drivers circling city blocks looking for a legal parking spot and fed up with the tickets they get when they can not find one . <p> Parking and Traffic Commission member Richard Grosboll said the agency has received " tons of complaints " about the parking crisis , not all of them demands for greater enforcement . " Half the people say we ticket too much and half say not enough , " he explained . <p> 1982 CITY HALL PROTEST <p> Getting tough with errant parking habits could touch off a rebellion . In 1982 , drivers flooded City Hall with protests over increased parking fines , pressuring the Board of Supervisors to cut fines by 50 percent . <p> Another example was the prolonged foot-dragging by worried city officials considering use of the Denver boot . It took years of debate before the city finally adopted the punitive wheel lock last February , making San Francisco one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . " It 's not very San Francisco , " argued one driver during the debate . <p> But other groups believe that tougher measures will yield a more habitable town . This year , senior citizen groups also pressured the Board of Supervisors to raise the fine for parking in a bus zone from $ 25 to $ 100 . The elderly argued that buses should be able to pull over to the curb safely to pick up older passengers . <p> Despite the bitter division over enforcement , San Franciscans united in November 1988 to pass a charter amendment that created a single new department to consolidate parking and traffic functions , which were then juggled among 13 agencies , including the police , public works and the parking authority . <p> Last year , Cutler , the deputy chief of Boston 's transportation agency , was hired as the $ 95,000-a- year director of the new bureau . After 18 months on the job , she has won high praise for effectively welding together the new , 510- member department from units and employees scattered throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A blunt , imposing woman with an easy laugh and informal manner , Cutler has concentrated on enforcement while studying other ways to lessen the parking crunch . She immediately moved to create 52 new parking control officer positions . The staff is now budgeted for 280 officers . <p> " She 's a very aggressive manager , " said commissioner Chin . Others have described the 38-year- old Cutler as " abrasive " in her relations with staff , but her hardball management style is paying off for the city 's treasury . Ticket revenue is up , totaling $ 38.5 million last year , nearly double the take in 1985 . And officers are now writing nearly a quarter-million tickets a month , 30,000 more than last year . <p> Many experts point out that San Francisco , currently facing a projected $ 91 million budget shortage , could benefit by hiring even more officers , who typically bring in more than four times their salaries and overhead costs . <p> But Cutler insists that she is under no pressure to hire more people . " Revenue is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow and " quality of life " top the list , she explained . If those improved , and fewer tickets were written , she said , " I 'd be happy . " <p> On the parking-supply side of the crisis , however , Cutler and the city officials have come up short . <p> Since the mid-1980s , the city has made some changes . For example , metered spaces are gradually being shortened from 22 to 20 feet . The city has also reduced the red zones around most fire hydrants . Diagonal and perpendicular parking has been added to many streets , often doubling the number of parking spaces . <p> 2,500 NEW PARKING SPACES <p> Cutler said she has moved to expedite construction of new city garages that will add 2,500 parking spaces in neighborhood commercial areas in the near future , a program that was approved by voters in 1987 . Plans for expansion of existing downtown garages are also under way . She also pointed to a vigorous campaign during the past year to tow abandoned cars , thus freeing more space . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concede , especially to relieve the critical shortage of parking in the neighborhoods . <p> A look at auto usage shows that the most severe parking shortage is in the neighborhoods at night and not in the downtown area . On a typical weekday , not counting the holiday shopping season , there is usually a surplus of downtown parking for drivers willing to pay up to $ 6 an hour in private garages . <p> San Francisco 's decades-old " transit first " policy has been successful in getting commuters out of their cars and onto public transit , say experts . As a result , auto traffic into downtown actually dropped nearly 4 percent between 1965 and 1983 , according to the latest figures gathered by city planners . <p> At night in the neighborhoods , it is a different story . That is where the huge numbers of vehicles come home to roost , according to officials . The problem is compounded by the lack of garages , the result of a housing stock built before the automobile became a standard feature of American life . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry notes plastered on windshields and complaints that the city is too slow to cite offenders . <p> PARKING IN BUS ZONES <p> To alleviate such problems in residential areas , a few ideas are being floated . These proposals include allowing drivers to park in bus zones at night , more diagonal parking even in neighborhoods that oppose it , and painting parking slots on side streets where inconsiderate drivers often take up more than enough for one space . <p> The advent of mechanical street sweeping in 1974 has also made the situation worse , parking experts contend . <p> In some areas where sweep times begin at 6 a.m. and 7 a.m. , car owners will park on the sidewalks the night before rather than get out of bed early to move their vehicles . <p> Making the sweep times an hour later in the morning would free miles of nighttime parking space in many neighborhoods , experts said . <p> Cutler said her department has not systematically analyzed many of the ideas or the additional problem of outdated or illegally painted curb zones , which give apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It certainly is time to re-examine colored zones , " she said . " That 's a critical priority for me . " <p> On the positive side , San Franciscans are driving motorcycles and scooters in record numbers , with registrations doubling since 1975 . City officials have responded by setting aside metered motorcycle zones throughout the city and have encouraged such ridership by charging only 50 cents for 10 hours of use . Six motorcycles can park in the same amount of space as one auto . <p> And finally , the rate of increase in vehicle registrations has begun to slow in the past few years , as San Francisco may have reached its vehicle saturation point .
