<p> It 's a quarter past 2 - in the blessed morning - and there are more stray dogs wandering the store than customers , one employee 's nail apron is jingling with caffeine pills , and there 's absolutely , positively no waiting on Aisle Three . <p> Welcome to Tool Time in the wee hours , when overnight workers jokingly compare themselves to the undead , when a trickle of bleary-eyed browsers gives a whole new meaning to the tired phrase ' shop till you drop . ' <p> For nearly two months , a pair of local Home Depot stores - one on Santa Fe Drive in Denver , one on Wadsworth Boulevard in Arvada - have been open 24 hours a day . Which probably makes you wonder : Who in the name of Bob Vila is buying screw guns and spackle at 3:27 a.m. ? <p> Insomniac do-it-yourselfers ? <p> Vampire plumbers ? <p> Intoxicated college kids trying to scrounge up the fixings to build a beer bong ? <p> Most consumers clearly buy the idea of all-night gas stations , 24-hour grocery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Home Depot 's marketing experts say their customers like the freedom of shopping without worrying about closing time , without having to wait for the doors to open on a Sunday morning . Of the chain 's 832 outlets across the country , about 60 are slated to be open 24 hours . <p> To find out if the tool business is as dead as a doornail in the dead of the night , The Denver Post recently filled some thermoses with coffee and spent the wee hours at the Home Depot in Arvada . <p> If we can read our groggy notes correctly , from midnight to almost dawn there were 13 actual customers , one dozing clerk and two teenage girls trying to hunt down a boyfriend who was working in the paint aisle . Here 's a drowsy diary from the depths of that Saturday morning on the graveyard shift : <p> 12:20 a.m . <p> Fresh from calling the Thompson Valley-Longmont High School football game for a Loveland cable-TV channel , Andrew Dalzell is now pushing a flatbed metal cart loaded with flexible , 31/2-inch perforated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got drainage problems at home . <p> Dalzell also is one of Home Depot 's prototypical overnight customers : someone whose work day ends way too late to hit a hardware store . The overnight shift also attracts some contractors , a few mountain commuters and , staffers say , people with broken pipes or other domicile disasters . <p> A few aisles over , Stefanie and Matt Pascal are spending their midnight hour pawing through cans of tile grout . The next morning - or , more accurately , later in the same morning - they 'll put their renovated home on the market . They are under the gun . <p> ' We 've been working on the house all day , ' Matt Pascal says , holding a plastic basket filled with cabinet knobs and a return air grill . ' We just planned on coming this late because there 's nobody here . It 's the best time to shop . ' <p> 1:25 a.m . <p> To most people , this would qualify as the middle of the night . To Eric Bennett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rear break room , Bennett is munching tacos with fellow employee Will Carrill and assistant manager Cody Pierce . From a television bolted high on the wall , they 're all watching a woman belt out a blues song on ' It 's Showtime at the Apollo . ' Of course , they do n't have a lot of viewing choices at this hour ; it 's either a dozen channels of infomercials or ' Laverne &; Shirley ' reruns . <p> Bennett has been working the overnight shift at Home Depot for almost a year now . Before the store was opened to the public , he and other employees spent the first hours of each day driving forklifts through the building and stocking shelves . <p> Now , over their fast-order Mexican food , they 're talking about what it 's like to always be up when the rest of the city is down for the night . <p> ' It took me about three weeks to get used to it , ' Bennett says . <p> ' Yeah , about then you lose contact with all your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Bennett agrees . ' I ca n't sleep at night anymore . I 've gotten to that point . We do n't need beds . We need coffins . We 're like vampires . ' <p> Some of the 12 employees in the store are still trying to work out the wrinkles - not to mention the punchiness - of life on the graveyard shift . <p> Many sleep as soon as they get home , trying to grab a few winks before their neighborhoods spring alive with the sound of humming lawn mowers or shouting kids on bicycles . They often opt for quick naps before returning to work the next evening . <p> On their nights off , some workers say they come back to the Home Depot because they have nowhere else to go , no one to talk to , and have to stay awake anyway . <p> ' It 's like a psychological game you play with yourself , ' says Dana Klein , the only checker on duty . This is just her third overnight in the store . ' It 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be tired . You have to remember that . ' <p> After work a couple of days ago , Klein tried to do some shopping at a Target outlet during normal business hours . She quickly realized the two worlds do n't mix . <p> ' I wandered around that place aimlessly for like an hour and a half , ' she recalls . ' I was like , ' I have to go back to bed . " <p> ' I call it The Vampire syndrome , ' says Laurie Keleel , who works on the special orders desk and has been pulling the graveyard shift for eight weeks . ' We all go running for our cars when the sun comes up . I mean it - I hate bright . ' <p> 2:10 a.m . <p> Talk about bad timing . <p> Rob Speckman and Bonnie Jolly have come to Home Depot at an hour when even the bars are closed , yet they have to stand in line at the only checkout that 's open , Klein 's cash register in Aisle Three . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple and Summit County homeowner Mark Astmann , who is loading up on tile grout , tub fixtures and mirrors for a weekend bathroom-fixup job . <p> ' This is our mad rush for the night ! ' Klein tells the customers . <p> Speckman and Jolly are buying shims and door jams for a new optical shop they 're remodeling and readying in Arvada . Called Perfect Vision Eye Care , they expect to open it very soon . <p> ' We went out to eat and on the way home , we thought we 'd just stop and get this stuff now , ' Speckman says . <p> ' We 're night people , ' Jolly adds before walking out with her supplies . <p> Then , suddenly , for the first time since midnight and probably the morning before , there are no customers in the place . Unless you count Bucho , a rottweiler who has just ambled in through the front door with his tail wagging . The dog , which belongs to Astmann , feverishly sniffs around some electrical materials before darting back out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to wait on , to check out or to assist , some of the workers stare into the parking lot and admit that boredom , not fatigue , might be the hardest part of the night . Some say privately they do n't fully see the wisdom in staying open around the clock . <p> ' This is n't a 24-hour town , ' one employee says . ' In this town , I think people are pretty laid back . At 11:30 ( p.m. ) they 're home watching David Letterman or sleeping . ' <p> Still , most of the employees on the overnight shift volunteered to be here . <p> Klein , for example , is coming up on her one-year review and figures she might get high marks for working until dawn . ' I 'm being a little kiss-ass right now , ' she says . <p> And co-worker Doris Ojeda says she 's saving $ 268 a week in daycare expenses by working all night while her husband and two kids slumber at home . During the day , her husband works at another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catnaps . <p> ' This is what you do if you 're poor - or I should say , it 's what you do if you just bought a nice little house in Northglenn and you do n't want to live in an apartment , ' Ojeda says . ' I have responsibilities . I have to do what I have to do . <p> ' I pay the other way by not sleeping too well . If my husband opens at his store , I wo n't sleep till he comes home ( in midafternoon ) . If he 's closing , I 'll be able to sleep in the morning . It changes all the time , ' Ojeda says . <p> To keep from getting groggy during her own work hours , she carries little yellow caffeine pills in the pouch of her nail apron . <p> ' They 're right in there , ' she says , ' along with the screws and stuff . ' <p> 3:15 a.m . <p> With the store empty and utterly quiet except for the Muzak playing on the speakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> He 's been found snoozing in his pickup truck out front . Quickly , assistant manager Pierce and a forklift driver rush out and start rocking the cab until the man wakes up . Pierce is smiling as he walks back in . The sleepy worker is rubbing his red eyes . <p> ' We 're loose , but we do n't let anybody run out with free stuff , ' Pierce says . ' We 've got to make it fun because if we do n't , nobody would want to work here . ' <p> For the stockers , the new hours mean the public has invaded their private space . No more naps . They have to show up in collared shirts . They 're forced to listen to the soft rock classics of Elton John and Gloria Estefan that are piped throughout the store . <p> ' They ca n't play their weird punk music anymore , ' says Keleel , smiling and standing at the special-orders desk . ' They ca n't whip around on their forklifts anymore . ' <p> 3:30 a.m . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erik and Kim Kosnar stroll into the store . <p> They are literally encircled by clerks who are itching to help the young couple . Maybe boredom makes the best customer service of all . <p> ' See , that 's the good thing about coming now , ' Erik says . ' There are plenty of employees and they 've got nothing to do . ' <p> The Kosnars call themselves ' the punk rock kids . ' Erik has long black hair and Kim 's locks are aqua blue . Erik is part of an industrial rock band called Emergence , and Kim is the group 's ' roadie , manager and groupie . ' <p> Some of the band members have just moved into a rental house together , and the punk rock kids have come looking for window coverings . <p> ' We were just saying what a weird idea this is that this store is open all night , ' says Kim , who is wearing a Marilyn Manson T-shirt . ' And yet 's it 's terribly convenient and so fun . ' <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kosnars pick up a halogen lamp , a bag of nails and some galvanized steel wire to hang pictures . <p> As they walk to the cash register , forklift driver Dan Bortot shouts to Kim , ' Hey ! I like your shirt . I have one at home just like it . ' <p> ' See , ' Kim says , ' that 's the other thing . You come out late at night and the people working are just like you ! ' <p> 4:05 a.m . <p> The sound of a ringing phone shatters the soothing Muzak buzz in the building . <p> It 's a call from a worried man in Gypsum , a mountain town about 21/2 hours west of Denver . He tells Pierce that one of his employees left for the Arvada Home Depot store almost 12 hours earlier with a blank check and a list of hardware to buy . The guy never came home . <p> Pierce asks if they 've checked the hospitals . But after he hangs up he thinks he 's got it all figured out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking midlife crisis here . I bet the guy 's in Texas now . ' <p> 4:15 a.m . <p> The Home Depot workers can see the light at the end of the tunnel . <p> This is about the time when contractors usually start arriving to fill up on materials for the day , when the morning shift is waking up somewhere , getting ready to come in and spell them . They call it ' the changing of the guard . ' <p> And the sound of an 18-wheel rig pulling up outside is a tangible signal that the workers have nearly beaten another night . <p> ' I hear the drywall truck ! ' Keleel shouts . ' Do n't you love this ? A drywall truck ! ' <p> Lalo Caldera is at the wheel , and he 's just driven up from Denver to deliver the goods . Keleel cranks open the roll-up lumber door by yanking on a chain . Instantly , the sound of beeping forklifts fills the air as workers scramble to unload the thick , gray sheets . <p> It 's now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again will run to their cars and try to escape the bright . @p#
