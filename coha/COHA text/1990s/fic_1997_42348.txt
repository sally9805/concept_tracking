One spring evening in 1979 , in the city of Los Angeles , Mrs. O. Watanabe was walking her Pekingese down a street of well-appointed homes . The air smelled of fresh-cut grass , and sprinklers jetted out water in accordance with rationing over the beautifully manicured lawns . Mrs. Watanabe felt happy to be away from the house , out in the soft night air . <p> Suddenly , as her old dog lingered over a bed of petunias , she heard rustling in the bushes behind her . When she turned she saw a man standing there in a purple raincoat . Seconds later he pulled his raincoat open and exposed his naked body to her . He did a lewd little dance , then turned and ran away . <p> Chue started to bark furiously . " Go get him ! " she screamed . Without considering the consequences , Mrs. Watanabe let go of Chue 's leash and let him chase the man down the street . When the man rounded the corner , so did Chue . Only then did Mrs. Watanabe worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran down the street in her comfortable pumps . She had not run for years . Her bladder shook and her breasts felt like they would tear . Once she reached the corner there was no sight of Chue nor of the man . Mrs. Watanabe sat on the curb and began to cry . <p> A few minutes later she heard another rustling sound coming up behind her . Here came old Chue , wheezing and trembling , dragging between his teeth the purple raincoat ! And then something else struck her . Though she hated to touch the garment that had been on the naked man , she searched the front of the coat for a tiny burn mark . It was there . It was the same coat she had given to a charity several months before ! One evening , late in the summer of 1968 , a young girl in the Brentwood Glen area of Los Angeles was sitting on her front lawn playing with a doll . It was neither a Barbie nor a Liddle Kiddie , and she did n't particularly like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick neck . Her mother always ignored her when she described the things she really wanted . Like those white knee-high boots that all the cute girls at school had . Her mother 's only response was " They 're unhealthy . Your feet ca n't breathe . " Why did feet need to breathe ? <p> The little dog across the street barked and barked . Suddenly the girl smelled the smoke of her mother 's cigarette . Mrs. O. Watanabe appeared on the porch . " No homework , no play , " she said . The girl was just about to whine her usual protests , like Do I have to ? when something stopped her . She said , " O.K. , Mommy . I 'll be right in . I was just about to rake the leaves off the dichondra first . " Her mother beamed and took a deep draw on her cigarette . " All right . Homework can wait for that . " <p> Susan threw the generic doll into the scratchy juniper bushes and started to rake the lawn , driven by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raked the lawn a few times in her entire life . Her father pretended that after a long week at the bank he enjoyed a little yard work , but he preferred to go to Las Vegas for the weekend to gamble and to see big shows . Sometimes if Susan 's mother complained enough , she went along too . Then the babysitter would show up , a prissy , pastyfaced , four-square Christian from across the street who tried to make Susan pray all weekend . <p> Anyway , that summer day in 1968 , as Susan raked the lawn , she was suddenly startled by the sight of several police cars pulling up at her babysitter 's house and kicking in the front door . As they entered the house , out ran Chewy , the babysitter 's tiny new Pekingese . Chewy ran straight across the street and dropped something at Susan 's feet . The object was covered with blood , but Susan recognized it immediately as an authentic Barbie . Exactly what she had been dreaming of ! Not only that , but the doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> One cold December night in 1978 , Mrs. O. Watanabe was walking her old dog Chue down a windy leaf-strewn street in West L.A. She enjoyed this weather as it was unusual in Los Angeles . It gave her a chance to wear her handsome new purple raincoat , which she had found at Loehmann 's for a third its regular price . It was still a splurge , but coats lasted a long time . She and her daughter had fought about another coat at Loehmann 's , but seeing as her daughter would graduate in a year and go to college in San Diego , where it was n't cold at all , Mrs. Watanabe had decided not to buy it . For some reason , this disagreement brought her daughter to tears , and Mrs. Watanabe had been so angry about Susan causing a scene in Loehmann 's that she had grounded her daughter that weekend . But now , wearing her purple raincoat , Mrs. Watanabe began to see another life , a life in which she and an amiable daughter strolled together with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been that kind of daughter to her own mother , but she had envied other mothers and daughters of that kind . Remorse began to grip at her and she chewed her lips . She lit a cigarette , even though she had just finished one , and began to smoke it nervously . She had to admit it , she had not done all she could for Susan . A piece of the cigarette crumbled away and landed on her lapel . She knocked it off , but it was too late . The beautiful purple raincoat had a burn mark on it . <p> Mrs. Watanabe began to cry . This was a sign from God that she was to pay heed to her thoughts . She was being punished . Which had she been worse at , as a mother or a daughter ? It was too late with her own mother , but not with Susan . She jerked harshly at Chue 's leash , tugging him through his routine walk in order to get home and talk to her daughter . <p> To her great surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home forever , and would never be back-right after Mrs. Watanabe had made this decision to be kinder to her ! It happened nearly thirty years ago in the city of Los Angeles . An entire God-fearing family was murdered in their home on a quiet suburban street on the West Side . The police could identify no one as a suspect , and no clues were ever found , nor did it appear there were any motives . But it had been a bad year for homicides in the city . Some blamed it on the whipping Santa Ana winds , some blamed it on racial tensions , and some on the ever-widening pool of newcomers to the town that seemed to promise so much easy wealth . Whatever the case , the family on the 14400 block of Belmar Avenue had neither been part of the fast life nor were they targets of any racial hate crimes . What agony for the neighbors on all sides of this family on Belmar ! No one wanted the quaint old stucco house , as charming as it could be , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its contents still inside , for years after the crime . <p> A young family by the name of Watanabe lived directly across the street from this house and had to watch over the accumulating emptiness of the residence from then on . More than once did the husband and wife argue over selling their own place and moving , the wife wanting to start over somewhere else , the husband not wanting to bother . Easy for him to say , Mrs. Watanabe would cry . He was away in Century City all day . He did n't even like to spend weekends at home . It was she and their daughter Susan who had to suffer with the specter . Ozaki would break down and hire a real-estate agent , and the house would go on the market until they received an offer , and then Ozaki would say the offer was n't enough and yank the " For Sale " sign right out of the ground . <p> Meanwhile , Susan 's menstrual cycle began early , when she was only nine and a half , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her mother , and thus began taking sanitary napkins out of the bathroom cupboards at her friends ' houses , then throwing them over the fence into the neighbor 's yard when through with them . One day the neighbor came over and complained to Mrs. Watanabe . Mrs. Watanabe , not knowing her daughter 's cycle had begun , shouted at the neighbor that it was physically impossible and furthermore , her daughter would never do such a thing . Now , all around the Watanabe house , things were getting unpleasant . But no matter what , Ozaki Watanabe would not accept any bids . <p> The neighbors were an old , guilt-ridden German couple , who had previously been friendly to the Watanabes on holidays , bringing them trays of Christmas kuchen . Susan felt trapped . She had nowhere to turn . And so began her ritual of visiting the abandoned house across the street on Belmar , and burying her sanitary napkins in a pit in the backyard . Until one afternoon , when Susan walked into the backyard with her paper sack and trowel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy base of an enormous palm tree that was known to contain rats . " I knew it ! " she cried , snapping Susan 's picture . That evening the Eichhomes presented the Watanabes with the evidence of their daughter 's disturbance , suggesting that the families end their feud and that the Watanabes seek psychological support for their daughter . Ozaki was very polite , but Mrs. Watanabe fumed . When the Eichhomes left , she cried , " I will not be tried and hung by my neighbors ! I will not ! " She grabbed her car keys , and in a dramatic gesture not normally taken by her , left the house driving too fast , tires squealing . <p> Ozaki was stumped . If his daughter was doing this , they should speak to her and help her , should n't they ? He had no sisters , and his mother had died of radiation burns when he was only three . He did n't have any idea what to say to Susan . Her mother should speak to her . What would he say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sat there holding the incriminating Polaroid of his daughter , he thought of the prostitute he had spent the weekend with in Las Vegas recently . She was a voluptuous , beautiful woman . He had been sorry to see her go . He had taken a Polaroid picture of her , not lewd , only of her face , smiling gently at him after she had dressed . Her warm expression was nothing like the frightened , surprised look on his daughter 's face , seen in the backyard of the house across the street , clutching her secret bag full of sanitary napkins . But something connected them . What was it ? He had kept the photo of his Las Vegas woman in his briefcase , and now he scrambled through the house to find it . Opening his briefcase , he reached into the top flap pocket and found the hard square picture with his fingertips , and pulled it out . He looked at the woman 's face , and felt a warm flush go through him . He would have to have her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife did n't insist on tagging along next weekend , it would be that soon . Now , what was it he was looking for ? He held up the picture of his daughter . And then he realized-it was the name Susan . Why had n't he thought of it before ? The woman and his daughter were both named Susan ! Never a cold winter there by world standards , but for Southern California it was a chilly one . School children ran out of their classrooms more than once to watch large hailstones pelt the asphalt , woolen clothes were selling fast at the department stores , and several nights in a row it broke the freezing point and people actually reported slipping on ice on the way to their cars in the mornings . <p> One woman experienced a Los Angeles winter the hard way . <p> Mrs. O. Watanabe had left her home with nothing one night , only the clothes on her back and her purse . She was tired of her husband 's lack of consideration of her , tired of trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she planned to put herself up in the nicest place she could find and charge it to him , and see if that woke him up some . She drove straight to Beverly Hills and found a grand old hotel where she had eaten lunch a few times with one of her women 's clubs , and checked herself in . <p> The room was beautiful . Now she needed to go out and have some fun . She would walk to a nice bar down the street and order a drink . But it was so cold ! On her way , she passed a few elegant clothing shops , still open for business . A new coat was in order ; it had been years since she had bought herself a new coat . <p> A man stood in the shop browsing , pulling out coats from the rack and examining them . He looked familiar . She was feeling adventurous and vengeful , so she said , " Excuse me , do I know you ? " <p> " I hope so , " the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Alan Jones . And you're- " <p> " Eileen Watanabe , " she replied . She still was n't sure why he looked so familiar . <p> " Looking for a coat ? " he said . <p> " I am . " <p> " What about this one ? " <p> He held up an expensive raincoat with a wool lining . Beige was n't exactly her color but she said , " Yes , you have very good taste . I 'll try it on . <p> Going along with this adventure , Mrs. Watanabe tried on the coat . It made her look pale-purple suited her better-but it was the kind of raincoat someone else would wear , maybe a reporter or an executive , and that was the kind of change she needed . <p> " It looks wonderful on you , " he commented . " An expensive raincoat makes a woman look confident , ready for anything . You should have it . " <p> " What are you looking for ? " she asked . <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she 's not as elegant as you are . She could n't wear this kind of coat . I 'll have to think of something else . " <p> Mrs. Watanabe promptly bought the coat . She decided to wear it right then and there because it was cold outside , so she had the salesgirl clip off the tags . The man followed her out of the store . <p> " I 'm not usually so bold , " he said , " but I ca n't let this chance slip away from me . Would you like to go have a drink ? " <p> Mrs. Watanabe was thrilled . She would show Ozaki after all ! " I 'd love to . I 'm staying at the hotel across the street . Would you like to go over there ? " <p> The man said yes . <p> Needless to say Mrs. O. Watanabe and the man ended up going up to her room together , wherein Mrs. Watanabe began to disrobe as the man kissed her throat and breasts . It had been years since she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was extremely excited to be with Alan Jones and had completely disrobed when he began to remove his own clothes . Only then , as he did a lewd little wiggle , did the strange feeling of familiarity change to recognition , and suddenly Mrs. O. Watanabe emitted a terrible scream . She screamed so loudly that the hotel sent up their security and beat down the door . She was clutching a sheet around her body as the door splintered . Alan Jones was the man who had exhibited his naked body to her years back , leading to the myocardial infarct that killed her favorite dog ! Everyone knows that jumbo jets regularly fly back and forth between the mainland and the Hawaiian Islands . But how many people know about the strange visions experienced on that well-traveled route by one woman from Los Angeles ? <p> Mrs. O. Watanabe was traveling to Honolulu to take up residence with her younger sister . She was estranged from her husband and daughter and wanted to leave all the bad memories behind . The flight attendant brought her a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she settled back in her seat and closed her eyes . It was nice to have the seat empty next to her . She let out a long sigh . <p> Suddenly , the thin , warm fur of her dog Chue pressed against her arm , the way he always used to curl up next to her . Mrs. Watanabe smiled . But the strange thing was , Chue had been dead for nearly sixteen years ! Mrs. Watanabe 's eyes flew open . There , sitting on the seat next to her , was Chue . She reached for him and he trotted into her lap . His whiskers tickled her nose , and she could feel his tiny body . He reached up and licked her face . How could this be ? <p> " Thank God you finally decided to get out of that miserable hole , " Chue said . " Your sister 's a little cold , but she 'll watch after you . And her kids are nice . I think this is going to be a good move for us , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watanabe stared at her dog , who had never spoken to her before even when he was alive , then across the aisle to see if anyone had noticed . But the man on the other side of the aisle had his nose in a political thriller . Shortly the flight attendant came to collect her tomato-juice glass and she smiled at Mrs. Watanabe as if there was absolutely nothing wrong with having a dog on board . Mrs. Watanabe was incredulous . This must be the spirit of Chue , come back to her , visible to no one else ! <p> " It is going to be a good move , " she said happily , ruffling her dog 's coat . " I 'm so glad you 're here . We 'll take walks on the beach at Waikiki . You can go swimming in the ocean . And you know what ? I 'm going to stop smoking , " she said . <p> " Excellent plan , " Chue said . " Oh , one other thing . Even though we just took off , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency return to the mainland before a bomb that 's loaded in the cargo hold explodes . Just tell them you have a sixth sense about these things . Then you 'll be hailed a hero and we 'll have a grand old time being celebrated wherever we go . " <p> Mrs. Watanabe was horrified , but took his advice . She pushed the button for the flight attendant and told the woman about her dreadful premonition . The flight crew took her seriously and returned to Los Angeles promptly , whereupon a bomb squad indeed found an enormous pipe bomb wired to go off shortly before their scheduled arrival time in Honolulu . Mrs. Watanabe was completely cleared of any suspicious wrongdoing , and became known as a psychic extraordinaire . She moved to Honolulu and lived very happily with her rather cool sister and the ghost of her old Pekingese . No person ever compared to his company ! <p>
