<p> SEISIA , Australia - It begins with a single seabird , a flash of wings plunging straight down through the growing ball of an orange sun . <p> Now another bird appears , diving , rising . Then another and another until the sky becomes a spatterpaint of black frigates and white terns . Almost in unison , three small boats veer toward the birds , propellers straining against the ocean swells . In each boat , hearts beat with quickening anticipation that soon will grow to a rush . <p> Suddenly it happens , an eruption on the surface close , very close , as a fish seems simply to appear in <p> the air , then come crashing down in an explosion of spray . Just as quickly , fish are everywhere , great hunting packs scything up through rafts of luckless baitfish driven hard against the surface . <p> " Tuna , " two anglers shout as one , leaning forward as if they somehow can make the boat go faster . <p> Like some madcap dance , the scene builds to a crescendo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as the eye can grasp . <p> " My God , the whole ocean looks like one giant Jacuzzi , " Lou Swift exclaims , then seems incapable of closing his mouth . <p> Swift , a Fort Collins resident who has pursued fish of every stripe around the globe , is among five Coloradans who have come to a remote area off Cape York , the northernmost point of Australia , on a fishing adventure that would take them down a wild coast inhabited only by crocodiles and an almost unbelievable array of fish . During a 10-day odyssey during which they see no other humans , they catch 39 different kinds of fish . <p> For the moment , their attention is riveted squarely on the melee caused by just one of those species , the northern longtail tuna . <p> I aim the nose of the boat into the middle of the maelstrom , cut the engine and grab for my fly rod . Swift has his fly in the water first and immediately is into a fish that , in its first wild lunge , spins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Targeting an onrushing pod of fish , I am forced to throw the opposite way to avoid my companion 's line . Even as I do , I realize that direction matters not at all ; the leaping , roiling mass is everywhere . <p> Each boat has become an island marooned in a froth of fish , and shouts of unbridled glee can be heard above the splashing . Battles are won and lost as fish go streaking away , mindless of the resistance from stout saltwater fly tackle . <p> " If I lock up on this one , I think it could pull me overboard , " Swift , a tall , powerful man , says of a fish that weighed less than 15 pounds . <p> In time , a bookend set of tuna are brought on board and dispatched . <p> " Sashimi for hors d'oeuvres tonight , " I shout above the din , then cast again with weary arms into a melee of fish that has diminished not at all since I first threw to it . <p> The place where this occurred is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoreline along the western edge of Australia 's Cape York . Just 10 degrees from the equator , the cape is the northernmost point in Australia , separated from Papua New Guinea by the 80-mile reach of Torreys Strait . It was in this historic passage that Capt . James Cook made his westernmost forays in the exploration of the continent more than 200 years earlier , naming the outlying islands for the days of the week on which he found them . <p> Reef-strewn waters <p> Thursday Island , a green hummock beneath the flight path of adventurers going to Cape York , once was the world 's most prominent site for pearl diving . Today it is headquarters of the equally famed Torreys Strait pilots , who guide large vessels through these reef-strewn waters , as well as the Great Barrier Reef on the east side of the cape . <p> Descendants of the islanders Captain Cook first discovered here now populate a scattering of aboriginal communities , including our launch point at Seisia , the only habitations in a wild place that time almost forgot . <p> Cape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visceral way . The no-frills airstrip at Bamaga now served by twin-prop commercial flights first was carved by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from the forest during World War II to launch air strikes against Japanese bases in New Guinea and in the pivotal Battle of the Coral Sea . The surrounding foliage conceals the remains of luckless aircraft that failed to make the runway after wartime raids . <p> Now planes disgorge a few adventurers and fishermen , the latter to join with Greg and Jennie Bethune on the Capricorn Mist , a 40-foot Grand Banks-style boat that will be the home for five Colorado anglers during the next 10 days . The Bethune operation , called Carpentaria Seafaris for the giant scallop of a gulf that dominates the topography of northern Australia , provides fishing access to approximately 100 miles of desolate shoreline interspersed with large tidal rivers . <p> This is home to an almost limitless variety of fish species , to a thriving population of estuarine crocodiles , large numbers of sea and shorebirds and absolutely nothing else . Most remarkably , we might have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost anywhere in the thousands of miles of ocean across the great expanse of northern Australia . Anyone who has n't been here will have difficulty comprehending the vast emptiness of a land where tropical oceanfront property is of seemingly no more consequence than dry desert . <p> True story : A couple on walkabout - that quaint Australian custom of leaving without telling anybody , least of all one 's employer - told of building an unauthorized cabin on a public beach in northwestern Australia , then occupying it variously for 20 years before officials finally discovered and dismantled it . <p> " Quite frankly , we were shocked they ever found it , " the man said . " I guess we 'll have to build another someplace else . " <p> Ready air access <p> The Bethunes chose Cape York for their operation for its ready air access and because they can pilot the Capricorn Mist back around the east side of the cape to their home in Cairns during the rainy season of February , March and April , when storms blow down from the northwest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year , southeast trades blow offshore , keeping the beaches and near sea in relative calm . <p> This makes it safe for anglers to venture a mile or two from shore in small aluminum craft - " tinnies , " the locals call them - from which they can conduct intimate pursuit of fish in unimaginable variety . Among the great litany of species our group captured were four kinds of mackerel , five of trevally , four sharks , three cods and many others no one ever dreamed of . <p> High on this or any list is Australia 's signature gamefish , the barramundi , a creature with a large mouth , bulging eyes and a voracious appetite for baitfish or a reasonable imitation . Barramundi , which resemble the Western Hemisphere snook in habit and appearance , favor the muddy currents of tidal rivers and lagoons , waiting in ambush among snags and seeps . While they sometimes grow to 40 pounds or larger , any specimen half that is a prize . A recitation of the more impressive specimens must include a 63-pound barracuda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the creature that joined our dreams at night and our thoughts upon waking was the queenfish , a slender , silvery wraith with a penchant for prowling the beaches and slamming every fly or lure that could be retrieved rapidly enough to attract its attention . When hooked , a queenfish rushes off toward deeper water with great greyhound leaps , leaving a string of punctuation marks across the water and a flyfisher foolish enough to grab the line with an acute case of finger burn . <p> The rivers , with their lattice of channels and bars narrowing back beneath a canopy of mangrove and palms , have yet another flavor . Here , with green parrots shrilling overhead , miniature tarpon surge from ambush amid a thatch of logs to grab a fly or lure , then turn splashing cartwheels through the tropical stillness . A confusion of smaller , but no less enthusiastic , fish lurk beneath mangrove roots , ready to pounce : jacks , bream , golden trevally , archers and , of course , the barramundi . <p> If this creates the impression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial lure , are easily deceived , then it is the truth . Just how much so is illustrated by this exchange between our guide and one of the anglers , a skilled flytier who had spent eager months preparing intricate patterns specifically for this trip . " Those are the finest flies we 've ever had on this boat , " Bethune said with admiration . " Which pattern do you like best ? " the angler inquired expectantly . <p> " It does n't really matter , " the guide replied . <p> " Would you choose the larger or the smaller ? " <p> " It does n't really matter . " <p> " Pink or blue ? " the angler had begun to sound deflated . <p> " It does n't really matter . " <p> Nor does it seem to count much where in this vast expanse an angler goes to throw these flies . Dean Butler , a noted guide headquartered in Cairns , directs similar excursions into the aboriginal enclaves of Arnhem Land and Kakadu , then on to the west past Darwin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers of Papua New Guinea . <p> " There are so many places here no fisherman ever has been , places that are wilder and more wonderful than you can imagine , " Butler enthused . <p> Peter Haynes , another Cairns guide who once spent 3 1/2 years driving around the country with a fly rod , speaks with equal glow about a region farther west , the Kimberley . <p> " There are places here that never have seen a boat , let alone a fisherman , " he said . <p> So precisely where does an angling peripatetic go to sample the riches of tropical Australia ? <p> Perhaps , after all , it does n't really matter . <p> Charlie Meyers writes about outdoor sports for The Denver Post . <p> IF YOU GO FISHING IN QUEENSLAND <p> Getting there : Qantas Airways has daily flights from Los Angeles to Sydney with frequent daily connections to Cairns .
