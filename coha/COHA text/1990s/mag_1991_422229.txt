Section : SPECIAL REPORT Our exclusive photo revelations prove you 're never too old to look young <p> Is it possible to look can't-believe-it's-true , knock-'em-dead-great at 50 years old and older ? Take a look at the following photos : Seeing is believing . The big question is , though , how is this possible ? <p> " Study after study shows that the signs we traditionally link with aging  --  increased body fat , weak muscles , a shrinking skeleton  --  all are primarily a result of being less active as we grow older , " says William Evans , Ph.D. , chief of the physiology laboratory at Tufts University and co-author of Biomarkers ( Simon and Schuster , 1991 ) . Plus , exercise has been demonstrated to improve stamina and energy . <p> So when we went looking for people 50 and older who are youthful in body and mind , we found living examples of what the research has been telling us . We combed the countryside for folks who , upon revealing their age , inspired us with an astonished " wow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of youthfulness . Many mentioned a positive attitude . Most described a low-fat , well-balanced diet . Good genes surely played a role . But one common denominator shone like a beacon : regular activity . Just like the studies say . <p> Not one of our subjects takes life sitting down . And the key to staying committed , all agree , is finding activities they love  --  exercise that makes them feel good inside and out . Perhaps the most exciting discovery of all is that it 's never too late to start . " The oldest exerciser in our lab is 102 , " says Dr. Evans . So hop on your exercise bike , turn the page and let these models of youth become your inspiration . <p> Yoshisada Yonezuka , 54 U.S. Olympic judo coach , 1988 , 1992 ; owner of the Judo and Karate Center , Cranford , New Jersey <p> " At my age , most instructors are doing just that  --  instructing , " says 5 ' 11 " , 180-pound judo coach Yone . " But I stay in good shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , four or five days a week . " <p> Yone 's been doing judo for 40 years , ever since his high-school days in northern Japan . After winning many titles , he moved to the United States and opened his own school . " Judo is very physically demanding . It has an effect on the muscles similar to lifting weights , " he says . " Because it also requires speed and endurance , it 's a great aerobic workout , too . " <p> Do n't let the physical demands discourage you from starting late , he says . While most of his students are youngsters , Yone affirms that it 's never too late for anyone to start , no matter what his or her level . " Within individual limits , everyone should be working out . " <p> Ruth H. Grobstein , M.D. , Ph.D. , 67 Founding director , Ida M. and Cecil H. Green Cancer Center , Scripps Clinic and Research Foundation , La Jolla , California <p> Being a physician and the founding director of a busy cancer clinic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program during the week . But she gets some real workouts anyway . The nature of her work keeps her hopping . <p> " I 'm so heavily booked that I rarely have a chance to sit at my desk , " she says . " If I 'm not running from one patient to another , I 'm dashing to committee meetings or sometimes standing in surgery . In fact , my colleagues kid me , calling my work shoes my ' running shoes . ' " On weekends , however , she always finds time for tennis , which she plays " for as long as I can possibly stand up . " <p> Sunny Griffin , 50 Co-owner , SunRich Development , Playa del Rey , California <p> Nothing stops Sunny Griffin from pursuing her passions . At 30 , she took up downhill skiing ; at 40 , she began classical ballet . <p> " The challenge is finding something you love , something you 're drawn to , " she says . " Ballet and skiing appeal to me because the level of intense concentration they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Another love , mountain climbing , has taken her to the summits of Kilimanjaro in Africa and Aconcagua in Argentina . " I come home from those trips totally refreshed , not to mention 10 pounds lighter , " she says . " Everyone thinks I 've been to a spa ! " The treadmill in her bedroom allows her to climb several times a week without ever having to come downhill  --  the part that 's hard on her knees . <p> " It sometimes startles me when I remember that I 'm over 50 , " says Sunny . " The concept of old just does n't relate to my life . People say , ' Gee you look good for 50 , ' and I always think , ' This is what 50 is supposed to look like ! ' " <p> Robert Delmonteque , 71 Health-club consultant <p> Forty years ago , young Bob 's career included preparing movie stars and then astronauts like Alan Shepard for the physical rigors of their jobs . Today , he remains as active as he was then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you were at 30 . <p> Twice a year he competes in Master 's bodybuilding competitions , for which he lifts weights and barbells , does numerous midsection exercises ( including a 50-year-old habit of 100 situps before bed each night ) and plenty of aerobic activity . " I prefer being outdoors and try to do something like cycling , jogging , swimming , hiking or powerwalking every single day , " he says . <p> Joan Rowland , 64 Pianist , singer and world-record-holding racewalker <p> " P " for peculiar . That 's where Joan filed the racewalking brochure that someone in Central Park handed her one day . But after she had a bout with angina at age 60 and her cardiologist prescribed walking , Joan dug out that brochure . <p> " I went to the clinic on Saturday , " she says , " And on Sunday , I entered my first race . " Within a year , Joan was going to national races . Now , five years later , she holds a world record and nearly 15 national ones . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " Many racers plan a strategy , but not me . I just empty my head , put a smile on my face and start moving . It 's exhilarating . " <p> Ann Martinet , 63 Past president , Association of Salk Institute ; president , Caridad Int'l . <p> " My philosophy is to exercise hard , then reward myself , " says Ann . " That way I always push , because I have something to look forward to . " So while every day begins with a workout , a leisurely and healthy breakfast of fresh fruit and a muffin or cereal is sure to follow . It should be no surprise then that the golden years have n't slowed Ann one bit . Quite the opposite . She and her husband have recently built an addition onto their San Diego home  --  an exercise room with stationary bike , rowing , stair-climbing and weight machines . <p> Kaylan Pickford , 61 Model , author of Always Beautiful ( Putnam , 1985 ) and Always a Woman ( Bantam , 1983 ) <p> Having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its benefits . Whenever Kaylan gets tired from sitting at the typewriter working on her new book , she heads outside for a few dozen laps or a two-to-three-mile walk . <p> " Exercise clears my head and gets my blood moving , " she says . " Reenergized , I 'm ready to go back to work . " <p> Such " organic " breaks have formed Kaylan 's approach to exercise throughout her life . " I 've never been able to tolerate the same old exercise routine every day , " she says . <p> " I 'm a person who needs flexibility . " The years she lived in Manhattan , for example , Kaylan counted on miles of daily walking around the city to and from jobs to keep her in shape . <p> Thom Weisel , 50 Chairman , U.S. Skiing/U.S.Ski Team ; chairman , CEO and founder , Montgomery Securities ; owner , Subaru Montgomery Cycling Team <p> In addition to competing as a Master 's cyclist , which requires up to two hours of lifting weights and cycling every day , Thom cultivates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why he 's currently serving as chairman of the U.S. Ski Team and running his own cycle-racing team . <p> " Being surrounded by the top-caliber youth in this country helps keep me young , " he says . " In order to keep up with them , I 've got to stay youthful myself . " <p> Judith Paige , 53 Nutritionist , model , author of Choice Years Health , Happiness , and Beauty Through Menopause and Beyond ( Villard Press , 1991 ) <p> A nutritionist by trade , Judy 's naturally committed to a well-balanced diet for long-term disease prevention . But for looking and feeling her best , she swears by exercise  --  a combination of yoga and aerobics . " I 've been doing yoga for 25 years and love it , " she says . " The strength-building benefit of even 10 to 20 minutes a day is amazing . Plus , it helps release tension from crimped-up muscles . " <p> Consistency , not intensity , is her aim with aerobic exercise . So at the beginning of each week , Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing beats the surge of well-being that comes from a good aerobic workout , " she says . " After a run , I feel like I 've just had a beauty treatment . My skin looks great and any vague worries are gone . " <p> Emese Green , 51 Theatrical producer <p> Walking through the hillsides of Tuscany , white-water rafting in Idaho , surfing at Sydney , hot-air ballooning through Europe , trekking in Nepal  --  Emese 's vacation choices reveal her philosophy that no line need exist between exercise and fun . <p> " I 'm a great believer in pleasure , " she says . " If you do n't enjoy what you 're doing , you wo n't stick with it . " Naturally , then , her three-day-a-week **27;145;TOOLONG regimen includes activities she loves : yoga , walking , weight lifting , dance . " These give me plenty of flexibility and energy , the two factors I find most important these days . " <p> Sheila Cluff , 55 Owner , The Oaks at Ojai and The Palms at Palm Springs health spas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 miles a week . <p> " Exercise is the thread that runs throughout my life , " she says . " I make it a rule to opt for being active over being sedentary , even in little cases like taking stairs instead of an elevator . " <p> Sheila 's commitment started years ago , after she gained a whopping 40 pounds in college  --  all because she quit her childhood sport , figure skating . <p> In despair , she took up running . Exercise made her feel and look so good that she became a physical-education major . The " cardiovascular dance " ( now called aerobics ) classes she taught after graduation eventually blossomed into her own business and two health spas . <p> Stein Eriksen , 64 1952 Olympic gold medalist ; director of skiing , Deer Valley Ski Resort , Park City , Utah <p> As boys growing up in Norway will do , Stein learned to ski soon after he learned to walk . Some later training in gymnastics cultivated an agility , flexibility and discipline that gave Stein a competitive edge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won the 1952 winter Olympic 's gold medal for the giant slalom . <p> Still called the " Sultan of Style " for his beauty and grace on the slopes , Stein continues to ski daily at Deer Valley in the winter . During the off- season , he can be found archery hunting , playing tennis and fly-fishing . <p> By Sharon Stocker <p>
