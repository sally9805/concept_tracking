BOB DOLE AND BILL CLINTON <P> What an incredible piece " Two Men , Two Visions " was ! I thought the election was just a contest between two political animals and that there was n't really a helluva lot of difference between them . With your brilliantly conceived and beautifully written article ELECTION ' 96 , Nov. 4 , I learned about everything that was at stake in the contest . At an important moment in American history , I found your report informative , uplifting and inspiring . NORMAN L. MARTIN Los Angeles Via E-mail <P> As a truly undecided voter , I was disappointed by " Two Men , Two Visions . " It should have appeared as a Time editorial . You showed pictures of the young faces of Bill Clinton 's supporters vs. the older ones of Bob Dole 's . You pictured the smiling , hopeful face of Clinton vs. the stern , bitter face of Dole . Then you drew several biased conclusions , such as Clinton 's wanting to be more like us and Dole 's wanting us to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you for the concise yet detailed picture of the choice between Bob and Bill . In the frenzy of the 30-second sound bites and campaign ads we were subjected to on TV , it was rather difficult to attain a meaningful electoral perspective that reached beyond the next round of the assaults on our intelligence . Your piece did justice to the presidential race . STEVE LEVINSKY San Diego <P> Your cover was just another example of how the media dismissed the candidacy of Ross Perot , who was the preferred presidential choice of millions of Americans . Perot was the only one who could have led our country to real reform . MIKE OWEN Dallas <P> We Americans have got through the democratic process of the election and effected change in our country . We occasionally have a hard time finding balance in the political arena . The pendulum swings too far to the right or too far to the left . Yes , our government can get too big , too bloated , too arrogant . However , I would hate to throw the baby out with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would prefer to keep our system and fight Big Government . With knowledge and citizen participation in elections , we can reshape government to benefit all Americans , not just the elite . WENDY TASSIN Poway , California <P> Two men , two visions , but no choice . Both candidates were helplessly chained to the politics of Big Money . We need leaders who can make the tough choices for our common good without worrying about what the National Rifle Association , the American Association of Retired Persons or other special-interest groups might do . We need a $1,000 limit on campaign contributions for individuals , corporations and political-action committees . The millions in " soft money " that flow to candidates must be stopped with laws and manpower that will deal out swift and sure punishment . DOUG WITTMER Topeka , Kansas <P> The words THE CHOICE implied that readers would be treated to a fair-minded and balanced assessment of the two candidates . Instead , I saw Dole 's 15% tax-cut labeled as " a turkey , " and his candidacy declared DOA a week before the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a single image of Clinton with the headline OUR CHOICE .
