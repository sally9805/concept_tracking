<p> SNOWFLAKE , Ariz . For Travis Walton , none of this is fun to talk about . <p> Who 's going to believe ? <p> On Nov. 5 , 1975 , Walton , then a reckless 22-year-old , says he was abducted by aliens , taken aboard their spaceship for five days and six hours , then mysteriously deposited on a highway near where he had been taken . <p> This is true , he says . It really happened . <p> A movie , Fire in the Sky , detailing it all , opens today . <p> In UFO circles , the case of Travis Walton is considered a credible alien abduction because it was also witnessed by six woodcutters returning home with him from a job thinning trees in a forest . Making it more compelling : All passed lie detector tests . Walton passed one just three weeks ago . <p> But no amount of apparent evidence has made it easy on the self-described abductee , now 40 and still living in Snowflake , a small community four hours northeast of Phoenix . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most popular girls in town , someone with ties to the founding family . But people still do n't believe . Not fully . <p> " There 's always the little undercurrents , " says Walton 's wife , Dana . Like in the grocery store . " Every time people look at us , I 'm sure they remember . " <p> Walton 's jaw becomes rigid when he talks about the way some react . " People can be awfully unkind . My wife has had some bad times . Certain people have been real nice to her in private , but when they encounter her where other people can see , they act aloof and distant . " <p> Some try to accept . Marlin Gillespie , then sheriff of Navajo County and now on the board of supervisors , says " there is no doubt they believe that what they saw really happened . " <p> " There were so damn many witnesses , " says Cy Gilson , a Phoenix polygraph expert who administered the original lie detector tests as well as the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't put up with a husband toying with their lives if it did n't happen , " adds D.B. Sweeney , who plays Walton in the movie . <p> For almost 18 years , Walton 's strategy for dealing with the whole thing has been denial : " Box it up , push it up into the past . . . You 'd drive yourself nuts trying to delve into it , trying to make sense of it . " <p> When producers came to him about a film , he said no . He had written a book , The Walton Experience , but " I was tired of the controversy . I did n't like the feeling of being a spectacle . " <p> Screenwriter/producer Tracy Torme , who had written Intruders , a TV miniseries that depicted UFO abduction cases , changed his mind . " If he could create something that would allow people to vicariously live what I 'd lived and experience what we 'd gone through , then maybe it would put them in a more objective frame of mind . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90% on the money . It was an ordeal to sit through , he says . " We saw the movie together , " says actor Sweeney . " It seemed like he had gone through it again and it was not a good place to go . " <p> This is what happened on that night in 1975 , according to Walton and the six guys driving down a road in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forests about 6 : 15 p.m . <p> Walton 's best friend , Mike Rogers , the crew chief , was driving the pickup truck when the seven spotted an object glowing a yellowish color and hovering about 15 feet above a clearing . <p> Rogers described it as like two pie pans joined together , maybe 15 feet in diameter . The guys were transfixed by fear . But Walton jumped from the cab to get a closer look . <p> " The guys were all calling to me , saying , ' Get away from there ! Get back in the truck ! ' I guess that egged me on in a way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing off a little bit . " <p> He remembers turning to go , but says he was hit by what felt like a physical blow " like a numbing shock and I blacked out . " What the guys say they saw was a beam of bluish light that picked Walton up off the ground and tossed him back down . " He fell like a limp rag doll , " Rogers remembers . <p> Thinking Walton was dead , Rogers gunned the truck and drove off . Fifteen minutes later , realizing he could n't leave his friend behind , he drove back . The craft and Walton were gone . <p> In the next five days , the six became suspected of killing their co-worker and concocting a wild story as a cover . <p> Glen Flake , then Navajo County deputy sheriff , did n't buy into murder . " I kind of wondered if they had some kind of accident and panicked. . . . but people are n't good kids all their life and suddenly turn out rotten . " <p> Townspeople were divided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call made from a service station in nearby Heber . It was Walton calling a brother-in-law for help . <p> Days later , Walton told what little he remembered that he had awakened for maybe 20 minutes and been in the company of humanoid beings who seemed to be experimenting on him . They put a mask over his face ; the next thing he recalled was being on a highway seeing the spaceship soar away . <p> The work of getting people to believe began then . The guys passed polygraph tests , but , says Walton , " the next thing it was a drug hallucination . How do seven men have an identical drug hallucination ? " The six passed drug and alcohol tests . <p> The aftermath took a heavy toll on Rogers , too . Disbelievers think it all was a hoax to get him out of a U.S. Forest service contract ; he says he lost the job because " I did n't perform . The UFO incident upset me terribly . " <p> He also guilty for abandoning Walton . But Walton says he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ? Get out and throw rocks at it ? " The incident contributed to the end of Rogers ' marriage and abandonment of his Mormon religion . <p> Rogers is played in the movie by Robert Patrick , Arnold Schwarzenegger 's adversary in Terminator 2 . " I knew I had to do the part because my birthday is Nov. 5 , " he says , and he discovered that he is a distant relative of Rogers by marriage . <p> Others in the truck that night are long gone from the area , but the movie is reawakening interest in Walton and Rogers . Both wonder if that will turn out to be good or bad . Rogers says a son has been taunted in high school ; Walton , the father of four , is ready to pick up and leave Snowflake if he has to . " Maybe it will have a cathartic effect process out a lot of old baggage , " says Walton , who works in the local wood mill . <p> There 's something he 'd like to say to the disbelievers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the facts and weigh the evidence , they do n't have the right to an opinion .
