When Michael Swell came South , he got in the habit of telling people he was from the midwest . It was a natural enough mistake . It seemed important to those he worked for that he come from someplace relatively harmless . The East was out of the question , and the West . . . well , the West , admit it , is nowhere . <p> Saying he was from the midwest , with a small " m , " was not really a lie . He knew enough about it to call it home , whatever that means , he thought . He had a quiet , flat , unaccented voice and a way of showing deference to nearly everyone . He was just unSouthern enough in speech and manner to be halfway intriguing without being too visible . He wondered who they thought he was . <p> His family was not large and was spread out in several states , which coincidentally all had towns called Springfield . Every couple of years or so they would find themselves together , miserably trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by ages and different mothers and several homes to wonder how they were all related . Yet they all had the same father , and whenever they were together their father pretended as though he had lived his life according to some personal code of conduct handed down to him by the forefathers . Their father was the one who pointed out that they had all ended up living in states with Springfields , and so he began calling them " the Springfield clan . " Actually , Michael , his youngest , was the only one who lived in a Springfield proper , but that did n't seem to matter . Their father started going around slapping his children on the back , not at all like him , and calling their pathetic get-togethers family reunions . If he was n't mocking them , as they wanted to believe he was , then he was really getting embarrassing to be around . It was clear to all of them that their father was beginning to regret his life-his idealism , as he called it . Michael was n't sure he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believing that he was sensible enough not to make his life a mess because of him . Unlike one half-sister who insisted she was born again and a much older brother who converted to pills and alcohol too long ago to remember , Michael was completely conscious of all the fatal turns his life could make . He was very careful , even about his lies . The midwest was as much home as anywhere else he had lived , he thought . <p> When he had been in Springfield a few months , he began to suspect that people had an idea of what he thought or thought he thought . Maybe not ; maybe because he was n't from the South , it did n't really matter where he came from . Maybe anyone from the outside was an easy target . <p> He had met some Southerners who , if they were n't determined to remain blind about the rest of the country , were happily oblivious to it . The rest of the world did n't seem nearly as important to them as a few personal concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't begin to understand them . He appreciated their reserve ; at the same time he was slightly annoyed at the distances they kept . He felt they saw him as a generality , and he wondered if he was supposed to see them that way , too . <p> Occasionally , no matter how innocuous he thought he was being , a mother of one of the girls he tutored would remind him of how different he was . " You 're not from down here , are you ? " she would say sweetly . They were always so polite . He would wonder what he had said or done to earn their amusement . It was as if he had crossed into another country , a parallel world , he thought . He had n't pretended something he was n't . The mothers were all aware of his foreign status , he thought , although no one ever came out and admitted such a ridiculous term to him . The midwest was n't Latvia , was it ? It was n't even New Jersey . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a tutor because of his differences . He brought another kind of perspective to the education of their daughters , he imagined . Not anything radical-English papers were English papers , were n't they ? - but perhaps because he was an outsider the mothers needed constant reassurance . In any other place in the midwest , for example-he might have taken that gentle reminder as a sort of mockery of him . <p> But down here the women he met were so blithe and charming and schooled in employee relations that he took the remark at face value . No , he was n't from down here , not at all , he confirmed . They enjoyed his bluntness , he thought . <p> Not being from down here seemed at first like a decided advantage to him . He did not have to pretend he belonged here , as he sometimes had done in other places . It did n't seem to matter as much in other places . He would never belong down here though , he understood . He could go about his business with the intrepid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being from somewhere else : his views were just his own down here , whereas the girls he tutored , for example , could not speak or act without impinging upon their family connections . They were all too Southern . But of course to Michael Swell , who located his tenuous roots in the amorphous midwest , there was no such thing , he understood , as being too Southern . If they were from the South , any kind of exaggeration made sense , the more extreme and violent the better . <p> One of his students happened to be a distant relation . Well , not actually a relation , properly speaking . Southerners have their own definitions of relations . Michael only admitted to that vague possibility in an attempt to overcome a kind of playful resistance in the girl . At times it was n't so playful , it seemed ( ask her mother ) , but it would take a psychiatrist , he thought , to justify the girl 's arbitrary nature . Yet he realized he began to enjoy their little tutoring sessions more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why exactly , although part of it certainly was the determined way the girl had of taking everything he said personally . If the truth were known , he thought , it was the girl who had unsettled Mr. Mike-her name for him-into thinking about a distant relationship between them , as implausible as it was . An uncle on her father 's side-she was very certain about this , she said-had raised a family in the midwest . There was probably still kin up around there , she said . She made the midwest sound like a specific locality . Her innocence amused him . She battered at him with questions about his past and then remembered every unspecific thing he said . Her memory of him , even as a general myth he created about himself , seemed more accurate than his own , which is not at all unusual if you think about it . Most of us anymore do n't really see ourselves all that clearly until someone else remembers us to ourselves . Then it 's like facing a familiar stranger we are a little uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was one of Michael Swell 's frequent responses to the girl . He found himself listening to her with a wry , amused look-midwestern bemusement , he told himself . It was n't midwestern exactly . That was what he thought she was thinking . Actually , it was the Swell look , that maddening way his family had of listening to one another as though they were measuring each other for the coffin . He hated to think he had carried away from his family the one protection they all used to insure their rigid privacy from each other . The girl did n't seem to mind , though . In fact she seemed to thrive on his amusement with her , first looking shy and embarrassed under it and then suddenly dropping down into a conspiratorial smirk that was almost too wise for her years . <p> Not long after they began meeting regularly at her house , she had asked him if he would help her with a journal she had to keep for her English class . Since he had never kept a journal himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he had , he came prepared with a number of anecdotal stories he had collected , all illustrating in various ways familiar , unambiguous virtues like honesty and perseverance and selflessness , traits that high schoolers anywhere could opinionate upon without much thought , he believed . After all , the girl was n't being asked to write anything too personal , was she ? She just needed to fill up a notebook for a grade . But it seemed she had already filled one notebook-two , to be exact-a fact she had carefully forgotten to mention to him earlier . Her teacher had refused to give her a grade for them and had sent her home to write 20 fresh pages of simple observation , one of the most difficult assignments in the world for her , he suddenly realized , especially the way she was told to do it . She was n't to include a single line expressing how she thought she felt . <p> " I do n't get it , " she fumed . " Simple observation . What is this crap supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So he had to read them . He read them at the dining room table while she waited , watching him with feigned disinterest and trying to gauge which parts he had reached by the way his face registered an emotion . He must have shown some expression other than amusement , he thought , because suddenly she grabbed them up from in front of him and began marking the pages with big Xs . <p> " Now do n't do that , please , " he grinned . <p> " Listen , " she said coldly , " I do n't know who y'all are or where mommy dearest found you , but let me give you some advice right off . My Daddy did n't raise no fool . " <p> He was shocked at her personal vehemence towards him . He thought they had been getting along . Suddenly he found his grin freezing into a constipated glare of embarrassment . He began stuttering idiotically . It had nothing to do with just having read page after page of scrawled denunciations , culminating in a sex romp between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , that was all amusing as far as it went . She had a talent for exaggeration which could turn any reader into a mild voyeur , he believed . No , what caused him to react so foolishly now , to lose his careful equilibrium with her , was her ability to involve him personally in a quarrel with herself which he really had no interest in , he thought . <p> " Just do n't try to make me into something I 'm not , " she warned him now . <p> He had no intention of doing that . He wondered how she could even think that . Tutoring was n't personal . He had done nothing , he told himself , nothing at all . After he had struggled for an hour with her over what he imagined her teacher meant by simple observation , finally convincing himself it was nearly impossible for anyone to do , she suddenly and shyly apologized to him for her outburst . <p> " You do n't hate me now , do you , Mr. Mike ? " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate her , he tried to say while blushing . She unburdened him as easily as she had unsettled him in the first place . He almost felt he owed her an apology . <p> At times like that she seemed far too old to be just 17 . At other times her own peevish amusement with him nearly distracted him to the point of amnesia . Then he could n't think what came next . <p> She was Evelyn , a wistful sort of name he enjoyed addressing her by but which she thought was silly and fatuous , " like someone 's dead aunt in crenoline petticoats , " she said . She preferred being called Eyn , pronounced like a boy 's name . Everyone called her that , except her parents , she insisted . They had paid for her name and therefore had to get their money 's worth out of it , she said , whether they liked calling her that or not . It was cute how she mocked them , he thought , while appearing to be totally serious . He had smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm lightly . " Stop that , " she said , trying to conceal her own vague smile . She knew how foolish she wanted to sound , he had thought . <p> She permitted him to call her Evelyn though , because he made it sound different , she said , " the way it must have sounded when it was new . " It was for that reason that he suddenly stopped calling her Evelyn and started addressing her as Eyn . She did n't seem to mind all that much , he thought . He realized what might be happening with the girl without her understanding it entirely . She might be falling for him , he thought . He had to be careful . He did n't want that kind of complication . He did n't want any kind of complication . He liked the smooth way things were going down here . He felt he was just getting started with his own life again . <p> Then one day after he had worked with the girl about a month , her mother , Mrs. Mabus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big family dining table , side by side , yet perfectly proper , reviewing for a test . " Now Eyn , " he said , " pay attention . " He must have said her name four or five times in the span of a few minutes , while her mother was going through the sideboard , or pretending to . He was aware he was overly demonstrating the role he had been hired to perform . Mrs. Mabus did n't say a word at the time , but when the hour was up and he was about to leave , she asked Michael if she could have a word with him in the kitchen . " Goodbye , Eyn , " he said . " See you next week . " He honestly had n't suspected a thing . <p> " Bye , Mr. Mike , " she grinned . <p> It was silly to be so formal about names , he thought , although he still preferred the formality of being called Michael by his students . After all , it was his real name . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a safe , impersonal quality , he thought , no matter who said it . Being called Mr. Swell was not out of the question , but Dr. Swell which some of the mothers used automatically , Mrs. Mabus included , seemed always a way of forcing a false respectability on him which he felt he did not deserve . They tried to raise him up-a small-time tutor , for Christ 's sake-into a fraudulent symbol of their status . They insisted he was something he was n't ; but it did n't matter as long as he remembered who he was , he thought . Down here he was just a cheap domestic cologne with a French label , he joked to himself . He did n't argue with them , though . If they wanted to keep up this illusion , if that 's what they were really paying for , he saw no reason to insist on accuracy . He would still do his job no matter what he was called . The whole issue of how he was to be addressed in Springfield was outside of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed . The illusion of him was far more public and substantial than his own private reservations about himself and what he wanted to be called . Dr. Swell-he could get used to the ring of it . <p> In the kitchen Mrs. Mabus was busy instructing her black maid . Michael did n't know the maid 's name . She always seemed to hover invisibly in other rooms at the edge of his attention . He forgot she was even around most of the time . <p> " I 'll be with you in a moment , Dr. Swell , " Mrs. Mabus said pointedly . <p> He watched her count out on her fingers the specific duties she wanted the maid to perform . The maid was wearing her white uniform with a little crum hat , and Michael assured himself he would probably mistake her for a nurse if he saw her on a street up north . That 's what he would assume naturally , a registered nurse on the way to the emergency room of a big hospital . Or the nurse in the pediatric ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would call them . <p> He realized he was being slightly perverse , but it seemed the proper thing to be down here . The maid was anything but the beetle-browed domestic having to repeat her duties back to Mrs. Mabus before she could be released from her . He had ceased feeling uncomfortable , he thought , by the sight of old black men working in the lawns of houses where he tutored . It was n't a surprise to him any longer . It was more like a dull , familiar vision which had taken on a kind of impersonal anonymity , like watching reruns of reruns of Mary Tyler Moore and wondering how it was you could n't remember the lines although you had heard them a dozen times ; you wondered how it could have ever been as funny as you thought it had been when you were living at home . How could people have been so amused once by such ridiculous characters ? <p> It probably had something to do with making adjustments down here . He no longer struggled to make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so normal . Struggle was the wrong word anyway ; it was too excessive to describe his curiosity now . What he saw seemed to be part of the scenery , jokes that were no longer really jokes , although they still occasionally called up a sort of automatic grimace , like a vestigial and gratuitous response . He was beginning to feel at home here , he thought . <p> After the maid left , Mrs. Mabus , who seemed deflated with exhaustion , flexing her counting fingers in the air over the chopping block and smiling tiredly , let out an exasperated and rueful sigh . She did n't have to explain herself to him , he understood , any more than the maid did . The maid had ignored his presence in the kitchen as though he were a harmless apparition , a familiar ghost from the past . <p> Michael felt Mrs. Mabus was being sincere , as far as it went . Instructing the help was a tiring duty which few understood or appreciated . He had seen nothing between Mrs. Mabus and the maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was in the kitchen witnessing their exchange was a sign to him that he had become a sort of communal fixture in Springfield , a member of a local family , so to speak , albeit an idiot relation to some degree , he imagined , a stepchild who took guidance now and then just to show he was polite . <p> " Well now , how are you two getting along , Dr. Swell ? " she asked him . There was nothing but measured kindness in her voice , a warm politeness without any unnecessary posturing . <p> " Just fine , " he said . " Eyn 's an interesting girl , Mrs. Mabus . Very alert and natural . A little independent , too . " He smiled . It was the kind of thing mothers liked to hear . It was the sort of generality that indicated breeding rather than improvement . <p> They had had a couple of assessment talks like this before . Evelyn had a study problem , as her mother phrased it when he was hired . Mrs. Mabus was careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and put up a set of fences no tutor could look over without going blind . She preferred him to be blind and deaf to start with , he suspected , then he would come to his own incriminating conclusions independently . <p> Her conclusions about her daughter , he already understood from listening to Evelyn-Eyn-carry on about her parents , were either wistful delusions or brutal truths . There was no in-between . Mrs. Mabus and her daughter were at war with one another , and while he did n't know-did n't want to know-the conditions of their quarrel , he knew he had to be extra careful . He was in a very awkward position , halfway in the middle . He could show neither favoritism nor too much understanding . He had to appear as an impersonal foil to each of them , always balancing one off against the other , making innocuous judgments about the both of them . To Eyn he tried to cast her mother in the favorable light of parental concern ( she had hired him , had n't she ? ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a younger confused version of herself . He was sure both saw through him and appreciated his tact . He did n't want to share their secrets from each other . He would remain perfectly open and above board with them . <p> After he had explained again his obvious procedures for dealing with Eyn 's study problem-he suspected her mother thought she had a faulty attention span-Mrs . Mabus , who was less interested than she let on , he felt , asked him how he was liking Springfield . <p> " It 's not for everyone , " she said . " I can imagine how different we seem to you down here . It takes some getting used to , but once you 're comfortable you can begin to enjoy the differences , I would think . We 're not all ogres down here , as I expect you 've discovered by now . We 're just ordinary people with our own problems which none of us asked for necessarily . " <p> Michael resisted making a comment which would have confirmed his differences . Mrs. Mabus already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was thinking that or not . He could n't say anything to unnerve her . He was n't supposed to be honest , just careful . <p> " It 's not as different , Mrs. Mabus , as you might think it is . I mean it is different , is n't it ? " he smiled knowingly . " I would be lying if I said it was n't . But there 's not a huge difference as far as I can see . " <p> " Yes , " she said vaguely , staring at him for a moment . " The South is not even the South any more . " <p> " It 's still pretty close , though , is n't it ? " he managed to say . He felt he had made a small inside joke , worthy of the time he had spent in Springfield . There was so much he was n't meant to understand , he thought , that it felt good to pretend he had a general understanding . Even Mrs. Mabus was smiling a little now as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sink . <p> He thought she was about to use that familiar old saw on him , that sweet condescension he had heard before to show him his place , " You 're not from down here , are you ? " He had earned it this time , he hoped . <p> He had n't intended to make his living doing this sort of hired work anyway . It only looked that way from the outside , he thought . He had made himself available for this role as a way of temporarily making ends meet . Suddenly , it seemed , there was a steady demand for his service from a certain kind of privileged family , which could afford having maids and ancient gardeners and , yes , even tutors who were total strangers . Mothers he had never met came up to him in the grocery store , as though he had just founded a new school of thought about children . It was the strangest thing to him . Amusing . He was a total stranger , and yet they acknowledged his presence as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt he knew these women , too , in some fundamental way-the way you might know a relative without knowing them , like seeing an old family snapshot taken before you were born . <p> It was n't so much his expertise they wanted , he realized , yet he could n't say what it was . At first he had tried to convince these women that he was qualified to handle their children , but in the end it was n't necessary . It only confused the obvious . He did n't lie about himself exactly . He had thought about finishing college one day , and he still might if nothing else worked out . He was n't like a redneck , he thought , who did n't value a useless education . Most of the mothers were n't as interested in his meager credentials as they were in him , Dr. Swell , as if he belonged to a bigger enterprise , something far less expendable than he was himself . Perhaps they knew something about him that he did n't know himself , he mused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him going , kept him grateful for whatever he got . <p> Mrs. Mabus was just keeping a check on him , he understood , the way Eyn sometimes did . They had to confirm where he stood at all times . They wanted to make sure he was n't hiding any secrets from them . A lot of what went on around him , he thought-the unspoken mystery of closing ranks , for example-still did n't make complete sense to him , but as an outsider the great shadow of a familiar past he could never share began to seem like a comforting illusion of certainty . <p> At times Michael Swell believed that if he had come from down here , no matter what his personal past was , he would not have to be so concerned with being agreeable . He would not look at the life around him with such wry detachment . That was the disadvantage of not belonging down here , he thought . Everything appeared as a kind of shallow joke . Did Southerners see themselves as jokes ? Yes , that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met were as amused with their manners as he was . But they were exclusive manners , they told themselves , and well-heeled Southerners were expected to laugh at the way they lived while still being loyal to it . It fit into his own notion of them : they were ashamed but got more mileage out of admitting their inferiority than any other people he had been around . Now when he smiled , he thought , he did so with a certain required guilt , as though he had nothing to back him up but his own smirking invisibility . <p> Just when it looked as if Mrs. Mabus was satisfied that he was still harmless and could be dismissed , the maid reappeared in the doorway . Once again she ignored Michael Swell as if he were n't there . Once again Mrs. Mabus came to life , excusing herself to Dr. Swell and openly involving Michael in their discussion . Not that they were talking about him or inviting his attention , but he felt their conversation was partially intended for his ears . It could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , perhaps it was private or meant to be and he just happened to be overhearing them . He self-consciously looked out the window over the sink so as not to make the maid feel uncomfortable while Mrs. Mabus hammered out more specific instructions for her to follow . It was only a courtesy , he understood . He felt the maid was incapable of being made uncomfortable by his presence . He was the one who was uncomfortable . He was looking away and pretending he was elsewhere . <p> Outside on the lawn an old black man was gathering up twigs in a long overcoat , although it was a pleasantly warm day . How strange these people were . The old man was moving in a mime of slow motion , and Michael once again found himself misrepresenting the gardener , just as he had misrepresented the maid earlier . He imagined him as a self-possessed professional of some sort , a journalist perhaps , harboring his secrets from everyone , hiding a wise eloquence behind a mask of servile geniality and passing Michael on the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference down here , of seeing how it was meant to be elsewhere , at some other time . The old man could have been attending to his own affairs , if Michael had not known where they were , if they both were not so grateful to Mrs. Mabus . <p> When he turned back , the maid had disappeared and Mrs. Mabus was saying , " Now where were we , Dr. Swell ? We were discussing my independent daughter , were n't we ? " <p> He felt a curious pressure , as though the old man on the lawn had looked up now and was watching him through the window when he could n't look back . " I did n't mean independent in a disrespectful way , " he heard himself say . He felt disconnected suddenly as if he were caught between two competing worlds simultaneously . He could only answer to one now . <p> " Oh , I understand you perfectly , Dr. Swell , " Mrs. Mabus said . " I understand Evelyn a little better than you do , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still slipping a little , he felt , while he regained his balance . <p> " I apologize for her , Dr. Swell . You really ca n't be expected to understand how Evelyn 's mind works . I think she genuinely believes she likes you to a degree , although liking you should n't have anything to do with the job you were hired to do . " " I have n't given her any reason for- " <p> " No , of course not , Dr. Swell . I never thought differently . You could n't possibly foresee her intentions . I 'm not even sure she does . " <p> " Intentions , Mrs. Mabus ? " he asked vaguely . <p> " It 's not important for you to know , Dr. Swell . Believe me . It can only complicate matters . " <p> " Know what , Mrs. Mabus ? I 'm a little confused . " He tried to smile to counteract Mrs. Mabus ' tired smile . <p> " Of course you are , of course you are , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park and have a nice picnic , but it 's impossible now . We used to do that , you know . On the spur of the moment , without giving it a second thought . Call up our friends and neighbors , people who were loyal to us . Mr. Mabus would bring a pony over from the stable for the children . You know what ? I do n't even think that stable is there anymore .... Well , enough of that , " she said , waving her hand in the air . " You see what I have to do now . It 's constant . Maids , the hired help . It 's constant , all the time . It 's as though they 've been given a set of keys without knowing how to drive . And who 's going to teach them ? Who has the time anymore ? " <p> " Was . . . was there something I did , Mrs. Mabus ? Something that Eyn . . . something she might have said I did ? " He was tittering as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yet . <p> " You , Dr. Swell ? " Mrs. Mabus asked , looking at him with amusing puzzlement . " What could you do ? Please do n't flatter yourself unduly on my account . It 's not like you , really it is n't . " <p> " Yes , all right , " he said slowly . He had seen Eyn 's personal journal , but she had given it to him to read . He never took it seriously . When was something not a secret ? <p> " You 're a nice boy , Dr. Swell . You work hard , as far as I can see . You seem to know what you 're doing , as far as it goes . You do n't spread rumors that are n't your concern or talk out of house . " <p> " Thank you , " he heard himself mumble . <p> " You 've been raised properly , I can tell . All your families down here say the same thing . You know when not to say things out of turn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all easy targets anymore . " <p> " It 's not difficult , Mrs. Mabus . " <p> " Oh well , my mistake then , Dr. Swell . I assumed you were still feeling a little out of sorts down here . It 's not your fault entirely , of course . " <p> " Pardon me , Mrs. Mabus , but I seem to be missing something here , " he laughed . <p> Mrs. Mabus looked at him , not severely but questioningly , as though she were being entirely open with him and he was just pretending to be arbitrarily slow-witted . <p> " Really , Dr. Swell , " she finally said , " you surprise me . " <p> He shrugged his shoulders and shook his head . He wondered if he could trust himself to say what he meant . He did ask why she was surprised with him , but it sounded foolish even to him . <p> " Maybe we 've overestimated you , " Mrs. Mabus said . For a moment Michael Swell thought he had walked onto an elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those claustrophic family tragedies , he imagined , in which what was being worked out had already happened years before any of the characters were born , and he happened to be playing some walk-on part . What walk-on part ? The stupid house guest from Denmark , of course , the one the real characters were wising up for no other reason than he happened to be present among them . He had a dreadful accent , but it did n't seem to matter that he was a fake . Some place ahead , in the last act , he would spill out his own secret-one that he had n't known was a secret-and the whole kit and caboodle would fall in on itself . The image of himself exiting the ruins of Magnolia House , or whatever name they gave this place , was so false and clear at the same time that he suddenly had an extreme reaction to his own overworked imagination . He started hiccupping idiotically right in the Mabus 's kitchen . <p> Even Mrs. Mabus was startled at its frequency . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and touching his hand . She instructed him to hold up his arms and went to the sink for a glass of water . When she came back , she told him to bend over at the waist , touch his foot with one hand while holding his breath , and drink the water from the other . He dutifully followed her directions . He never felt more stupid in his life . There he was , bent double in the middle of the kitchen with Mrs. Mabus patting his back , when Eyn walked in on them . <p> " Mother , " she gasped , " what are you doing with my tutor ? " As soon as he heard her voice , Michael sprang up flushed and dizzy . Eyn had changed outfits and was eyeing him with a triumphant look as though she had finally succeeded in dislodging a stubborn toad from a gutter pipe . She was stunning to look at . She was n't exactly prettier than when he had seen her a few minutes before with her hair up , sprawled out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , but against the backdrop of her mother and all that he had n't been meant to understand in their conversation , she reminded him of an uncirculated penny . She was in a sleeveless sundress and heeled sandals , and her tanned arms and legs looked as if they had been newly varnished . He felt a pang of sudden , futile longing , knowing that he was always going to be someone to her for whom there was no reprieve , no hope of change . Then it passed , as it would have anyway , he told himself , and he went back to seeing her as her mother always insisted she be seen , as the girl with the study problem . <p> " I have the hiccups , " he apologized , staunching his breath and blushing . <p> They all waited a moment in bemused silence . The hiccups seemed to have disappeared as suddenly as they began . <p> " My husband 's brother used to get them incessantly , " Mrs. Mabus said . " They took him to one specialist after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recall . They each had a different useless theory for why it happened . Some of the cures were quite painful for him , as I remember . " <p> " Tell him the truth , mother , " Eyn said . " He was the pain . He was so embarrassing to the family they would lock him in his closet . " <p> " That 's absolutely not true , Evelyn , " Mrs. Mabus said , smiling over at Michael . " They seemed to think it was related to stuttering in the old days . " <p> " Oh brother , " Evelyn said , rolling her eyes at Michael . " I did n't say it , young lady , " Mrs. Mabus said . " The outside specialists did . " <p> " But you went along with them , did n't you , Mother ? You wanted to believe it . " <p> " I had nothing whatsoever to do with it . It was a problem in your father 's family . I just happened to be aware of it . His condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Then why did they try to hide him ? Out of sight , out of mind-is that it , mother ? " <p> " What in the world are you talking about , Evelyn Elizabeth ? " Mrs. Mabus looked at Michael . " I apologize . It 's quite beside the point , is n't it ? " <p> " Did he recover ? " Michael asked quickly . It was an innocent question , yet he found himself asking it out of irritation with Mrs. Mabus . He wondered what the point was . <p> " Well , Mother , did he ? " Eyn asked . <p> " Well , of course he did , " she said . " He 's perfectly normal today . " <p> " Yeah , he hates his whole family down here , " Eyn grinned . " I wrote him a letter , you know . He lives up where you 're from , " she said to Michael . <p> " You did what , young lady ? " Mrs. Mabus said quietly . <p> " I wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for school . We had to write somebody we did n't get along with . Or somebody who did n't get along with us . " <p> " What in the world for ? " her mother said . <p> " It 's Christianity , mother . " <p> Michael began to smile . Mrs. Mabus looked over at him . " I know about Christianity , young lady , " she said . " It has nothing whatsoever to do with sending letters to your Uncle Sidney . Why did n't you come to me ? " <p> " See , I used to get along with everybody , " Eyn said , ignoring her mother and talking to Michael . " So I could n't think of anyone to write a letter to . I mean there were kids who were n't really my friends , but it was n't because I hated them or anything . Or they hated me . I mean that 's what a lot of kids ended up doing anyway . They sent letters to each other . It was stupid . Some even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get along . But it was n't that we did n't get along . Do you see what I mean ? We got along fine . We just were n't friends . So I did n't have anybody to write to . Then I talked to Daddy and he sort of started going on about Uncle Sidney 's old problem . I think he thought of writing him a letter once . " <p> " Why did n't your father say something to me ? " Mrs. Mabus asked . <p> " Because , Mother , you would n't have let me write a letter . You would have got Daddy on your side . " <p> " I would n't have stopped you if you wanted to write to one of your little friends , " Mrs. Mabus said . <p> " See what I mean , Mr. Mike ? " Eyn said . " It 's hopeless . " <p> " But just to write to a total stranger . . , " Mrs. Mabus said . She rubbed her thumb against her index finger and studied her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother . He 's still family , whether you like it or not . " <p> " But you 've never seen him , my dear . He 's been gone from before you were born . " <p> " That does n't matter , Mother , does it ? He hates me too . " <p> " He does n't hate you at all . The very idea your father would suggest that . " <p> " He did n't suggest it , Mother , " Eyn said . " He suggested I should write a letter to you . " <p> There was a pause , and Michael cringed inwardly . He wondered if he should excuse himself . Mrs. Mabus would be grateful to him for that , he thought . But he also felt that Evelyn-Eyn-relied on him now . She was directing her remarks to her mother through him , and he felt a warm suffusion of necessary belonging , as though he were a representation of Uncle Sidney 's invisible presence , that hiccuping boy who was rumored to be kept in a closet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perversely justified , then , in being here . He did n't feel he should leave , yet . It was all slightly curious to him , as if some veil were being lifted . He almost felt he deserved to know who these people were . They had kept him in the dark all this time . <p> " You were going to write me the letter ? " Mrs. Mabus finally said . " Your own mother ? " Her voice was reasonable , as though she had practiced her aggrieved response a thousand times over the years . <p> " Do n't have a cow , Mother , " Eyn said . " I did n't write you the letter , did IP Your secrets are still safe with me . " <p> " We 'll talk about this when your father gets home , " her mother said . <p> Eyn was grinning then and she turned to Michael . " First , I wrote Uncle Sidney the letter and showed Daddy , but he would n't let me send it . " <p> " Good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he was afraid Uncle Sidney would write back and say bad things about him , " Eyn continued , " like how Daddy had treated him , his own brother , and never apologized . Daddy would hate for me to know who he really is , would n't he , Mother ? " <p> " Evelyn , " Mrs. Mabus announced calmly , " you 're going to cry wolf once too often one of these days , young lady . " She looked at Michael . " Some people do n't know when to believe you . " <p> " Oh right , Mother , " Eyn said . " Anyway , then I got this great idea , Mr. Mike . I wrote Daddy the letter and pretended I was Uncle Sidney . Is n't that great ? I went on and on about this neat family I had and how happy we all were . I waited until the end , and then I said , Oh by the way , I forgive you for locking me up in the closet . ' When Daddy realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Eyn grinned . <p> " How clever of you , Evelyn , " Mrs. Mabus said . " Is n't she clever , Dr. Swell ? And it 's just like her . She can write a letter from anyone but herself . Why do you suppose that is , dear ? " Evelyn was grinning openly . " Perhaps our Dr. Swell has an opinion . Eyn , is n't that what she has you call her ? " <p> " Oh , Mother , " Evelyn groaned , " why do you have to stick your nose in everything . Really . " She flounced over to the refrigerator and opened it . She bent over and stuck her head inside . <p> " You do understand of course , do n't you , Dr. Swell , that she made up that ridiculous name for your benefit just so she can say you call her that , " Mrs. Mabus said . <p> " Mother " - Evelyn 's voice was muffled- " give Mr. Mike some credit at least . After all , he works for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does . You 're perfectly right . " Mrs. Mabus was smiling now . She had n't really not been smiling , Michael realized . " She 's Evelyn or Miss Evelyn to everyone . I know you will remember that in the future , Dr. Swell . You 're a nice boy . We 're happy you chose to live in Springfield , are n't we , Evelyn ? " <p> " There 's not an ounce of ice tea anywhere , Mother , " Evelyn whined . <p> Mrs. Mabus had the courtesy to turn away from him now . She went to the doorway . " Vessie , " she said . It was nearly a whisper . " Miss Vessie , stop everything you 're doing right now and come here . " <p> Michael Swell stood in the middle of the kitchen , not able to stop grinning . Mr. Mike and Dr. Swell , he thought . He wanted to enjoy all the idiotic versions of himself . He had been tripping over himself so often he had stopped paying attention . He was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a story . Dr. Swell , I presume . So this is really home , is n't it ? he mused . He felt he was standing there on the edge of a daze . He was surprised at himself . He was n't feeling as uncomfortable as he expected . Home : the spot in the world from which you never escape . It was laughable . He had been so careful , only to end up here , in a place he could n't avoid if he had wanted to . There was a certain cleverness to his thoughts now which he was n't smart enough yet to figure out . Now he could say he understood the people down here . They were like him in some peculiar way . They got in each other 's way . Yet , unlike him , they preferred that to the alternative . Had n't everything seemed more clear to him before he arrived in Springfield ? Clarity , he realized now , was n't necessarily the best thing , was it ? Clarity had n't made him happy . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now there was n't any reason to clear things up . How many Springfields were there ? How many could you call home ? <p> Miss Vessie stood in the doorway now . Her eyes met his . She smiled . <p>
