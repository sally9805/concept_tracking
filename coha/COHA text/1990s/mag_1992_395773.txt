CHARLIE 'S EYES GLITTERED against the mesquite flames . He walked like a dark bear from the chilly night and held in his right hand the treasure of the South Texas brush . " Check it out , " he said softly . It was a massive whitetail deer antler . We stared , transfixed . The weathered shed was white and broken but the gnarly remnants were awesome . The base measured 6 inches in circumference . The curving beam was as thick as a pistol grip to the break , and the spear of the remaining tine was 14 inches long . An ancient and raw hunger danced in the fire . You could feel a surge of excitement as clouds of breath pressed close . We never bagged or saw that buck , but the heroic proof of its existence remains one of the strongest images in my two decades of hunting the brush . For nimrods who skipped zoology 101 , buck deer shed their antlers each year . The bone-like headgear sprouts in velvet during the spring , grows with amazing rapidity during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or early fall . The prideful buck rubs free the dried velvet , then carries his gleaming new headgear into the rutting season of fall . In late winter , following the mating season , the antler bases undergo a chemical breakdown . This process may be accelerated several weeks during a harsh year of poor range conditions , or delayed several weeks by lush range and mild weather . When the breakdown occurs , the antlers are shed as the brittle beams detach from the skull . The attuned hunter can benefit from these discards , and early spring is an excellent time to search for them . ( Be aware , however , that the collection of any property , including shed antlers , is illegal on public lands such as National Parks , National Wildlife Refuges , and some State Parks , so check with the land management agency of the area you are scouting before you remove any antlers . ) Sheds are easier to locate before the onset of heavy carpets of underbrush . Also , they are less apt to be damaged . Animals such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bone-like substance ; a determined effort can bob or even remove a primary tine , " kicker " tine , or beam tip . And , as no small consideration , the early prospector can beat the prowling eyes of next season 's competition . The most obvious return from examining a fresh shed is a fix on a specific buck . A recovered antler can either substantiate an earlier sighting or , thrillingly , announce the existence of previously unsuspected game . The gnarly calling card is undeniable proof that at least one buck lives in that area . Frankly , as wily and secretive as mature whitetail bucks have become , I am surprised that they have not figured out a way to bury or burn their sheds . Until that evolvement occurs , the pre-season hunter who finds a fresh shed has a starting point for the fall . As a big advantage , the site of the shed often marks a dominant buck 's home turf . The discard can be a more reliable indicator than sighting the animal itself . " The actual sighting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you much about where to hunt that deer during the next season , " said wildlife biologist Steve Warner of Camp Verde , Texas . Warner specializes in trophy deer management and , with hunter/rancher Bobby Parker , developed the popular Bushlan South Texas camouflage . He knows the habits of whitetail deer . " Some dominant bucks may travel a lot , as much as 4 or 5 miles during the rut . The point is , sighting a moving buck in November or December does n't mean that 's where he 'll be next season . " But , if you find a big shed , that is a good clue to the deer 's home ground . After the rut , a mature buck returns to his chosen ground  --  the area he 's staked out that 's got good cover , forage , and water . He pretty much stays in that area , resting and recovering from the stresses of the rut , and that 's where he usually drops his antlers . Find one of those antlers , study the terrain , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deer during his regular movements to food or water . " This optimism is based on the assumption that the previous owner of the weighty headgear did not deteriorate and die during late-winter cold or summer drought , or that harsh or unnatural conditions did not force the animal to relocate . Nothing is guaranteed in the realm of bucks and brush , but Warner 's homeground thesis is solid . Warner 's crews recover approximately 100 sheds per year , and these findings are documented against annual census counts . Veteran South Texas rancher Bill Carter confirms the home-ground thesis , adding that the shedding is a random process . " A whitetail drops his antlers when he is moving , doing something to loosen the bases . It 's not a premeditated act . You generally find one shed at a time , near where the tines snagged some sort of obstruction and he paws or shakes it free . Good areas to look are heavily traveled game trails through thick brush , especially a trail near a reliable food plot or water source , a place the deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fenceline used as a regular crossing . An unhassled buck , even a big one , usually ducks under the strands rather than leaps over . It 's easy for him to hang a tine in a strand . " It 's pretty rare to find both sheds side by side , " Carter added . " I 've found complete sets together only three times in maybe 100 recoveries on the Sombrerito Ranch . But , if you do find both sides within a few yards back in heavy cover , you may have located the old boy 's bedding area . A bedded deer is quiet , less likely to knock an antler off , but it can happen . That 's worth knowing about . " Seasoned ranchers and hunters become instinctive monitors when driving fences , crossing pastures , and opening gates . Last year , Carter made a great discovery near a gate on his ranch 's main road . " I saw the tip of a tine in the grass by the fence . I walked over , not expecting much because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen a really big deer in that area . Well , let me tell you , it was a 170-class ( Boone and Crockett scoring points ) buck  --  assuming the other side is symmetrical . No one had seen that buck before . He was right under our feet and must have gone completely nocturnal . There 's a brushy draw near that gate , and I know where I 'll be opening morning . " Carter 's find illustrates the ability to obtain accurate measurements from a shed . The pre-season hunter who finds a fresh shed can define to a fraction the trophy potential of a buck . Of course , the animal could be coming up or going down , depending on age and range conditions , but even this dated " hard " information is more valuable than the big racks conjured around campfire smoke . The trophy hunter who finds one beam can take precise Boone and Crockett measurements and speculate . Now , it becomes an exercise in philosophy  --  is the water glass half full or half empty ? Is the other antler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointments in the brush tend to downplay the missing potential , but either way , a single beam held and measured provides a thrilling documentation difficult to gather in most other hunts . A shed from a previously sighted animal not only reveals a buck 's potential , it tells the astute hunter something about himself  --  about his powers of observation amid the frantic seconds of lost opportunity over a fumbling safety , for instance . Exactly how good was that muy grande you glimpsed bounding through the brush ? Whitetail antlers have a remarkable propensity to grow in reflection . If you got a brief or distant sighting of a distinctive buck , the subsequent recovery of his shed can provide the cold facts on your ability to field judge in the clutch for trophy potential . Several years ago , while overseeing a rocky ridge in the Texas Hill Country , I saw a ten-point buck with forked brow tines . The bold " Ys " were matching exclamation marks on an altogether impressive rack . Naturally , such bucks seldom are spotted broadside and stationary in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of cedar behind my left shoulder . In attempting to turn to cover the departing animal , I telegraphed trouble and spooked the deer . At camp , I was aglow over the big buck . " Easy 20 inches on the inside , maybe 21 , with 22-inch beams and 11-inch tines , " I gushed . The mysto-buck was not sighted again that season , despite enthusiastic vigils along the ridge . That spring , a ranch hand recovered the right beam in a thick draw below the ridge . The shed , with its bold , forked brow tine , was without question from the same animal . Between you , me , and that coyote laughing over there , the shed revealed that my deer was not the buck of legend . It remained a decent buck , but it was nowhere near the animal that benefitted from my hungry stare . The point is , a shed , more so than the average hunter , will tell the tale of the tape . The tape does not lie , but if the antler appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A single shed can be a little deceptive , " said Warner . " Keep in mind you are looking at just one antler , not the whole head . And you do n't get the impact of the beam spread , which is what excites a lot of hunters . Almost always , a single antler that looks pretty good belongs to a really impressive animal . " Regardless of exact measurements , a good shed is a special prize . For centuries , hunters have been enthralled by the sweeping beams and heavy bases and soaring tines . The sight of an old antler amid the new grass excites a wildness and inspires a vision . This is the confirmation of the past and the hope for the future , the tangible proof that greatness exists . The author often depends on shed antlers to provide information on potential hotspots . <p>
