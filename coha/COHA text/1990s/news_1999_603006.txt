<p> Just as major corporations from banks to power companies thought it was safe to turn on their computers , they face a new Year 2000 bug : the guy who says he invented the main technique to fix the glitch . <p> Bruce Dickens , 49 , a computer programmer at Boeing who patented the method , recently sent letters to 700 giant corporations seeking a licensing fee and annual royalties . <p> Dickens has even leavened the New Year 's Eve drama  --  will computers go haywire ?  --  with his own legal countdown . If the firms pay up by Dec. 31 , he 'll offer an " incredible " special that would cut their upfront fees to an average $ 125,000 , vs. $ 12.5 million afterward , says his lawyer , William Cray of Laguna Beach , Calif . <p> Experts scoff at the claim , saying programmers have used the shortcut , called " windowing , " for decades and the patent can easily be challenged . " The notion that he invented it is ludicrous , " says high-tech consultant Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove it . <p> Some legal experts are not so dismissive , and Dickens , a retiring , bespectacled resident of Irvine , Calif. , has quietly become a major nuisance for the nation 's biggest corporations just as they brace for New Year 's Day . " He 's caused a lot of angst , " says analyst Kazim Isfahani of Giga Information Group . Instead of focusing solely on final computer preparations , many Year 2000 managers are combing through software at the behest of company lawyers to see whether windowing was used . <p> " It 's techno-extortion " and " unethical " to divert their attention so close to Jan. 1 , says consultant Howard Rubin of the Meta Group . Cray retorts that Dickens just got the patent last spring and his initial overtures went nowhere . Several firms say they have been Y2K-ready for months and the patent claim is not a distraction . " It would have no impact , " Dave Johnson of AT &T; says . <p> Still , to skirt further hassle during a crucial period , some companies will likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000-a-year programmer , whose idea of an exotic vacation is a family trip to the Iowa farm where he grew up , stands to become an instant multimillionaire if just a handful of the behemoths pony up a fraction of his asking price . <p> At the very least , Dickens has hit on a shrewd legal strategy , parlaying the quirks of patent law and the Y2K crisis to target deep-pocketed titans and pressure them to " sign up quickly for a small amount of money , " says Washington lawyer Jonathan Band . " You 're a big company , and you 've already spent $ 50 million ( to repair the millennium bug ) . If you can make him go away for $ 100,000 , that 's a tempting thing to do . " <p> Even Isfahani allows , " He 's being a capitalist . You ca n't fault him . " <p> Dickens seems unfazed by the furor . In a phone interview with him and his lawyers , the soft-spoken Midwesterner says , " This is my invention . I got a patent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he concocted windowing in 1995 after McDonnell Douglas , since acquired by Boeing , asked him to resolve the Y2K bugs in company inventory records . The glitch could cause computers that use two-digit dates to malfunction by interpreting " 00 " as 1900 instead of 2000 . <p> Rather than changing every two-digit date to four digits  --  which is expensive and time-consuming  --  windowing picks a starting date . If that were 1930 , the program would assume that " 00 " to " 29 " is in the 21st century , and " 30 " to " 99 " is in the 1900s . <p> Dickens says he came up with the idea while driving his white Ford Ranger to work on the Orange Freeway . McDonnell Douglas won the patent in September 1998 and sold it to Dickens for $ 10,000 last April . " That would have to be the best thing I 've done in my life , " Dickens says of the idea . <p> Analysts say nearly 90% of businesses have used windowing , sometimes in tandem with other Y2K fixes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies last summer , Dickens decided to play hardball and hired Cray 's firm , Levin &; Hawes , which recently won a record $ 143 million trademark infringement judgment against drug giant Pfizer . <p> Cray deployed a dartboard strategy , targeting every Fortune 500 company , as well as big high-tech firms . To figure damages , he did research showing businesses using windowing instead of pricier Y2K techniques saved 2.5% of annual revenue . <p> Dickens , he says , is seeking a " very , very reduced " license fee  --  .0025% of a company 's revenue , or $ 125,000 for a $ 5 billion firm , plus annual royalties of .001% of revenue . The rates jump 100-fold after Dec. 31 . Cray , however , says he 'll dicker . Dickens might even waive the annual payments for the right price . <p> Cray says he 's gotten responses from about 25 companies and is in settlement talks with a handful . Several Fortune 500 companies  --  including Chase Manhattan Bank , Bell Atlantic , IBM , AT &T; and First Data  --  refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isfahani of Giga says Y2K managers " are infuriated by this , " and most will likely refuse to pay on principle . Experts say companies have used windowing since the 1960s . Insurance companies that keep birth dates or property records from the late 1800s used the method to tell a computer whether dates fell in the 19th or 20th century . And bankers used it to solve Y2K-like glitches posed by 30-year bonds and mortgages . <p> Proof , de Jager says , is widespread , including a 1986 article in IBM Systems Journal that says an " excellent " way to solve date problems " is to specify a year as the desired starting point of a 100-year range . " <p> Although the U.S. Office of Patents and Trademarks must ensure no evidence of earlier uses exists before issuing a patent , " they can only do so much , " Washington lawyer Scott Alter says . A patent can be invalidated in court by proving the invention is " obvious . " <p> Dickens says he was unaware of any prior uses , and no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Information Technology Association of America likened Dickens ' campaign to " putting plywood on my window in a storm and then claiming a patent on it . " <p> Lawyers say simply showing prior uses of windowing would not be enough . Dickens ' patent includes 13 other ancillary elements , including a feature that notes the correct century , Cray says . " Patent litigation is very expensive and very uncertain , " Band says . " Who knows how a jury is going to " view a standoff between a corporate Goliath and a mild-mannered programmer ? Plus , litigation costs might exceed any settlement fee . <p> Not the first <p> If Dickens is stretching the bounds of patent laws , he 's not the first . For years , some small inventors have filed broad patent applications , keeping them secret until companies use the ideas , then suing . A patent reform bill passed by Congress last month would limit such lawsuits . <p> Dickens , meanwhile , faces risks , too . If he ultimately sues , he would have to prove companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he probably wo n't know until he gathers evidence before a trial . As a result , some lawyers predict Dickens will simply wring what he can from the companies now , then drop the matter . Several " will quietly cut a deal to get rid of it , " Isfahani says . <p> If just 10% of the 700 companies fork over $ 50,000 , Dickens would bag $ 3.5 million . " The money is really an afterthought , " he says . " As an inventor , I have rights . " <p> He says he is n't sure how he would spend any financial windfall except : " My lifestyle would be better . " He plans to donate 20% of any royalties to start a foundation to fund software research . And he says , " I would like to do bigger inventions . I have a lot of ideas about things , " including a lawnmower that " mows by itself " and new ways to cover the backyard holes dug by his Airedale terrier , Pagi . <p> Dickens says he cultivated his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he drove the tractor , fed the hogs and chickens , milked the cows . " Every day was like every other , " he says . In high school , he built telescopes . <p> After graduating from Iowa State University in 1972 with a degree in chemical engineering , Dickens took jobs as project engineer at Fluor and as a controller at Northrop before joining McDonnell Douglas in 1986 . <p> He lives in a modest stucco tract home and enjoys playing with his two young daughters , biking , fishing and puttering around the house . " He 's quiet , introverted , " his wife , Karen , says . " He would be a great gentleman farmer . " Dickens also reads books on Christianity and watches little TV , though he enjoyed the movie Y2K . " Everybody needs to have a wake-up call , " he says . <p> TEXT OF BIO BOX BEGINS HERE <p> About Dickens <p> Name : Bruce Dickens <p> Age : 49 <p> Profession : Computer programmer , Boeing <p> Residence : Irvine , Calif . <p> Married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 5 , Colleen , 3 <p> Hobbies : Biking , fishing , inventing , playing with his daughters <p> Education : Peakin Community High School , Farson , Iowa ; ran cross-country , played guard on basketball team , president of math and science clubs ; degree in chemical engineering at Iowa State University <p> Favorite books : The Carpetbaggers ; the Left Behind series of Christian books <p> Favorite recent film : NBC 's Y2K <p> Inventions : Y2K bug repair method ; working on a self-mowing lawnmower .
