Section : THE CULTURE WARS <p> Class criticized poem for its lack of a woman 's perspective . Note the unconscious gender privileging  --  his terror , his glory , his phallic monuments . <p>  --  A student 's notes of a class on Yeats 's " Meru , " from Philip Roth 's Sabbath 's Theater . <p> Multiculturalism " is not an ideal on the North American campus today but an entrenched reality . Those who do not love it bear it , and those who accuse it are few . It defines the core of the moral mission of the contemporary university . The very question of culture as it presents itself in the university today is identical with that of multiculturalism . This is not without implications for the university 's role within the broader society . <p> At the same time , there is more to the university than its moral mission , and imperatives other than moral ones to which it must respond . In what follows , I will consider not only multiculturalism but other factors that collaborate with it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the benefit of those who have been paying scant attention , a crash course in multiculturalism . It is only multiculturalism in the university that I will discuss ; it may be that in more reasonable milieux , multiculturalism , too , manifests itself more reasonably . What is multiculturalism ? <p> The notion of multiculturalism depends on that of culture . More precisely , it depends on the relativistic understanding of " culture " which has dominated the intellectual life of postwar North America . <p> The history of the notion of culture is complex . For our purposes , it may suffice to refer to the distinction between culture as employed in the still intelligible expression " a cultured person " and culture as it figures in multiculturalism or such other current expressions as " biker culture . " For culture as in " biker culture " no more suggests a cultured person than a biker could be described as cultured . <p> Until not long ago , the transmission of culture in the older sense was taken to define the noblest task of the university . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnold ( 1822-1888 ) , the British man of letters who became naturalized in post-World War II America . In Culture and Anarchy , composed in 1867-1868 at a moment of grave political crisis in Britain , Arnold had defended the cause of culture against the strictures of each of the three great parties of the day , the aristocrats ( Arnold 's " Barbarians " ) , the middle class ( his " Philistines " ) , and the as yet unenfranchised workers ( the " Populace " ) . <p> For Arnold , " culture " retained its Latin sense of cultivation ; it was want of education and a consequent vulgarity with which he taxed all three of his opponents . His project was the education of both sentiment and reason , and his models were Hellenic and Hebraic , the two great fountainheads of the Western tradition . Culture was the ( somewhat uneasy ) synthesis of these two strands , the Hellenic , which was preeminent in intellect and taste , and the Hebraic , which was preeminent in earnestness . Arnold 's claim was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective antidote . It alone could lift us above our petty passions as individuals and those of our party and our time . Culture thus was good not only for the individual but for the polity : It defined the education suitable for free men . <p> Arnold was the grandfather of the vision so pervasive in American universities of the fifties and early sixties : the education of all citizens , regardless of race , religion , or class , in " the best that has been done and thought " ( Arnold 's phrase ) - and the residual faith that this best was to be found in the masterworks of the Western tradition originating in the Bible and classical antiquity . Everyone of my generation knew teachers still inspired by this faith . <p> This vision of higher education had not reigned unchallenged even prior to the tumult of the sixties . On the one hand , the university of the fifties was already actuated ( as those in a democracy will be ) by more utilitarian concerns , as well as by an ethos of social justice which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . On the other , the patronage of distinguished refugees from National Socialism had spurred the dissemination of a newer notion of " culture " incompatible with Arnold 's . <p> This innovation was the work of German philosophy but first entered the American academy early in this century in the garb of anthropology ; here the great name was Franz Boas . " Cultural relativism " taught that every people had a " culture " ( the totality of its social practices ) and that all cultures were equal in the specific sense that there were no neutral principles for the evaluation of cultures , no such principles that were not themselves relative to a particular culture . The ultimate implications of this allegation were murky ; Nietzsche , who thought hard about them , concluded that the irreconcilability of cultures implied implacable warfare among them . Be this as it may , in America cultural relativism aroused from the outset enthusiasm in progressive circles for its perceived support of egalitarianism and tolerance of diversity . By 1950 , it had become the reigning doctrine of North American liberalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as often as not embraced neo-Arnoldian notions of liberal education as well ; the tension between the two was not yet evident . Today , the dogma of cultural relativism supplies the common denominator of the bewildering variety of usages of " culture " typical of current discourse . <p> Multiculturalism is a more recent development . It presupposes not only the doctrine of cultural relativism but the civil-rights and other liberation movements , the mass influx into North American universities of students of non-Western background , the influence of the " postmodernist " celebration of " difference , " and the anti-Americanism of the 1960s ( repackaged as anti-Westernism ) . The politics of multiculturalism <p> In approaching the current situation in the universities , it is useful to follow my Toronto colleague H.D. Forbes in distinguishing between multiculturalism as a fact and multiculturalism as a policy . Multiculturalism as a fact  --  a great variety of " cultures " or ( more precisely ) of racial and ethnic backgrounds among the inhabitants of any one polity  --  is increasingly as much a feature of life on campus as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering students at my formerly rather homogeneous university arrive from households in which English was not the first language . To many of these , the classics of political philosophy which I teach represent not the " high culture " of the milieu whence they come but at most that of the one which they aspire to enter . <p> Multiculturalism as a policy is , among other things , a response to multiculturalism as a fact . Universities face the task of integrating large numbers of students of non-Western or Third World background , just as these students face that of adjusting to the university . Much as bilingualism in elementary education is touted by its proponents as easing the integration of Hispanic students into American society , so the promotion of " cultural difference " on campus is said to further the successful integration of " culturally diverse " students . We give the newcomers their own societies , their own residences , their own pride days , their own courses , and even their own academic programs , as well as " representation " in the mainstream curriculum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens of the broader academic community . <p> One may describe the preceding as the liberal defense of multiculturalism , and its attractiveness is obvious . So conceived , multiculturalism may easily appear the natural extension of the tolerance and openness on which liberals have always prided themselves , adapted to the wider diversity of ethnicity , and so of " culture , " which now characterizes North American society . Unfortunately , this appearance has proved misleading . <p> For multiculturalism as a policy is not only , or even primarily , a response to multiculturalism as a fact . It is also and primarily an ideology , one as uniquely Western as the cultural relativism on which it draws . If all cultures must be presumed equal because all standards for the assessment of cultures are themselves culture-bound , then there seems no reason why a university should transmit one culture ( i.e. , Western culture ) to the exclusion of others  --  and every reason why it should n't . For so to " privilege " Western culture  --  a favorite term of accusation among multiculturalists  --  is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inasmuch as liberal thought today both subscribes to cultural relativism and understands itself and liberal democracy as ( merely ) Western , the paradoxical conclusion looms that to " privilege " liberalism is itself illiberal . This paradox has plagued liberals off campus as well as on it . <p> No matter that to subscribe to cultural relativism is itself to " privilege " Western culture , since the former is a distinctly Western conclusion that follows only from distinctly Western arguments . The appeal of multiculturalism has never depended upon its theoretical consistency . This appeal is political . Once one frames the situation on campus in terms of neglect and recognition , it is inevitable that student , community , and faculty champions of the different " cultures " on hand will insist on increased representation in the curriculum as a token of the acknowledgment of a worth fully equal to that of other " cultures . " Like all human constituencies that have not retired to a hermitage , multicultural ones tend to press their clout to the utmost . Clamoring for recognition <p> What multiculturalism demands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition " of all cultures . Ultimately , it is not at all clear what this could mean . Pious professions aside , no one really believes that all cultures are equal , that all deserve unconditional recognition , and that there is no rational basis for discrimination among them . ( The multiculturalists believe this least of all , as witness their lengthy indictment of the sins of Western culture , with the clear implication  --  and often the explicit assertion  --  that not only is Western culture not better than other cultures but is actually much worse than they . ) Nor can there be any intellectual vitality to a university in which one is forbidden to raise the question of the right way of life . This last point is implicitly granted by multiculturalists themselves , who promote " diversity " as furthering this very quest  --  by expanding the horizons of those engaged in it . <p> Once one grasps that the equality of all " cultures " or ways of life is an empty nostrum , cultural recognition on demand becomes condescending and meaningless . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering the natural history museum , it signifies not that all are giants ( let alone that they are equally so ) but only that all are present . This problem of how to extend equal recognition to all cultures without by that very token trivializing it is one with which no less a thinker than Charles Taylor has struggled without success . <p> Practically , however , the implications of " recognition " are clear enough . They include increased " representation " of each culture in the general curriculum and a free hand to its champions to construct a playground of their own at university expense : a course , a program , even a residence . Given the proliferation , and therefore fragmentation , of " cultures " clamoring for recognition on campus today , the politics of multicultural recognition tends toward the formation of ever more recondite groups ( e.g. , " Gays and Lesbians of Color " ) . It also promotes a general inclination to treat students ascriptively rather than as individuals . <p> Even without the adoption of multiculturalism as the official doctrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the academic block would press for some representation of their respective legacies in the university curriculum . It is only natural that they would wish for their offspring the opportunity to devote part of their higher education to the study of their own past ; and their pride would suggest to them that their legacy was worthy of the consideration of other students also . Such has been the pattern with the Jews , Italians , Slavs , and Baits , all of whom have as both individuals and communities initiated programs and endowed chairs . So too one must applaud the farsightedness of those universities that have taken it upon themselves to establish new departments of this kind even in the absence of an immigrant constituency  --  one thinks of the first departments of Russian and of East Asian studies in North America , founded around the turn of the century . Such initiatives are in every way to be welcomed , and have enriched the university curriculum to the benefit of all . <p> If this were the model for multiculturalism , if the chief concern of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study pre-Western or non-Western ways of life under the guidance of competent and unprejudiced scholars , no sane person could object . Unfortunately , while multiculturalism sometimes fosters expansion of opportunities of this sort , this is not really what it is about . <p> These earlier expansions of the university curriculum were just that , expansions . They were not offered as a repudiation of existing practice . There was no attempt to compel the attention of the indifferent , whether by transforming the core curriculum or otherwise revolutionizing the manner in which other subjects were taught on campus . Doubtless it was deemed good for the Jews that Jewish Studies be taught at Harvard . But it would not have been deemed good for them that Gentiles should have their noses rubbed in it by a revision of the Harvard curriculum to feature Gentile oppression of the Jews , as if that oppression were the central fact of Western culture , for which Dante , Shakespeare , and Goethe must eternally be called to account . Yet just this would define the program of a hypothetical Jewish " multiculturalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested , multiculturalism is an ideology , an expression of our current Western , North American culture . The fuel of highest octane to be found in its tank is " post-Modernism , " with its theoretical celebration of " difference . " Postmodernism is itself the progeny of the Western philosophy of the past century . Whatever else may be said for or against it , there is not a non-Western trick in its bag . African-American postmodernists  --  as well as " people of color " ( including that inevitable subset " women of color " ) from the Third World who cultivate a " postcolonialist " and/or " feminist " critique of Western " cultural hegemonism "  --  inhabit a single world of intellectual discourse with their white Western counterparts . That world of discourse is Western . I have n't surveyed the whole vast postmodernist literature , and would expect to find occasional exceptions to the rule that I am stating . Still , one will rarely encounter a more efficient engine of intellectual sameness than this ideology which celebrates difference . <p> From which it follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students to the serious study of other cultures than with persuading them of a certain interpretation of our own . It differs from the New Left of the sixties not so much in the sins of which it accuses North America ( although it accords a new emphasis to those of " sexism " and " heterosexism " ) as in its ascription of those sins not to big business or the military but to North American or , better still , Western culture . <p> Accordingly , the multiculturalists ' presentation of non-Western cultures tends to be in the service of their critique of the West . The very multiculturalist understanding of " culture " proves to be political rather than anthropological . Women , African Americans , homosexuals are all counted as " cultures , " and to many multiculturalists these are the ones that matter most . Since " cultures " are exalted in opposition to the dominant " culture , " the badge of a culture is the degree of neglect or oppression that it has suffered . As for serious examination of actual non-Western ways of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as ancient India or Confucian China or medieval Islam  --  multiculturalists tend to show little interest in it . For these rich civilizations possess neither the charm of marginality nor that of primitivism  --  the characteristics best adapted to flaying Western oppressiveness and rationalism , respectively . <p> To be sure , multiculturalists must cope with the problem that no non-Western culture has ever been " multicultural " in the desired sense . Other civilizations have much to teach us ; but not that . One way of evading this difficulty is by casting non-Western societies as players in current Western melodrama . An ancient European matriarchy shimmers , one which allegedly worshipped " the Goddess . " Great civilizations rise in Africa , along with Hellenic larcenies from them . The American Indian replaces Smokey the Bear as protector of the environment . It is these half-truths , cardboard cutouts , and figments of ideological imagination that cast the gravest shadow on the alleged scholarly benefits of multiculturalism . <p> If it is bad for students to contract misguided notions of other ways of life , it is worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greatest harm that multiculturalism does is to the teaching of Western " culture " itself . There is first the tendency to exaggerate the relative sinfulness of the West , as if all-too-human vices ( racism , imperialism , etc. ) were distinctively Western vices . It is , of course , appropriate to a university setting that we study our own society as much as possible in a critical spirit rather than a celebratory one . Indeed , one of the strongest arguments for a liberal education has always been that it provides one with that distance from one 's own time which is necessary for grasping its shortcomings . It serves , in other words , as an antidote to unreflecting partisanship . <p> Multiculturalism , on the other hand , endorses partisanship ( in the form of intransigent group self-assertion )  --  so long as it is directed against " the West . " In order to do so , it must dismiss all productions of Western culture , including ( and especially ) those previously most admired , as themselves mere expressions of partisanship  --  racist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " the canon " <p> We can now grasp the significance of those attacks on " the canon " which comprise the cutting edge of multiculturalism . The denizens of Arnold 's lofty precinct are deemed to comprise not an aristocracy but an oligarchy , which has oppressed the rest of us for far too long . Accordingly , the " expansion " of " the canon " is not for the sake of rectifying unwarranted omissions in the membership of Arnold 's circle of " the best that has been thought and done " ( by admitting Al-Farabi or the Buddha or George Eliot or Proust , for instance ) . ( Indeed , today 's multicultural warriors speak not of the expansion of the canon but of " canon-busting . " ) At issue is rather the achievement of that distribution of group representation currently deemed equitable . No one really claims enduring greatness for Frantz Fanon or Toni Morrison or Rigoberta Menchu  --  their presence in the core curriculum attests to the dethronement of that standard . ( That they belong somewhere else in the curriculum I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what few books are most worth reading has always occurred and is both necessary and revivifying . ( I bracket " canon " because , as Christopher Kelly has noted in the Gallatin Review , it is misleading and prejudicial when applied to works other than the sacred texts of religion : " The term ' canon ' is used much more by people who attack its supposed existence than by those who defend Great Books programs . " ) The question is the standard to invoke in this debate : the merits of the candidate , regardless of the group to which he or she belongs , or of that proportional representation by " cultures " which dictates that only three Greeks be admitted ( one of whom must be Sappho ) . <p> In practice , the preferred solution appears to be a compromise between " the canon " anti multiculturalism . However benign in intention , this yields an incoherent mishmash of older works of recognized greatness and newer ones representative of preferred " constituencies . " Precisely in the case of these latter , however , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ( and the self-esteem of the constituencies in question ) . So while one is permitted ( or even required ) to denounce Yeats , one must n't criticize Maya Angelou . Even where the rubric under which an older writing is presented is not clearly invidious , it tends to be so anachronistic and trendy , so completely removed from the concerns of the author , as to foreclose serious engagement with the work . <p> While it is typical of multiculturalists to denounce " the canon " as homogeneous , the homogeneity that they ascribe to it is spurious . Upon examination , " Western culture " proves to owe its millennial vigor precisely to the persistence within it of outlooks in permanent tension with one another . What has saved the West from ossification is a chronic state of spiritual warfare . Hellenic versus Hebraic , Christian versus Jewish versus Muslim ( for Islam too has contributed largely to " the West " ) , premodern versus modern , nature versus history , the contemplative life versus the active one  --  these and countless other tensions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West disappear from the purview of the multiculturalists . What remains is the " white , " the " male , " the " Eurocentric , " the " Western "  --  a lowest common denominator or , more precisely , an ideological construct . <p> The defining feature of " the canon " reduced to straw man is its alleged function as the public-relations arm of the bourgeois capitalist status quo . However improbable this is as a reading of Sophocles or Augustine or Dante ( to say nothing of such more recent additions to the list as Marx and Nietzsche ) , anything is possible through the magic of " cultural studies . " If one begins with the axiom that all works of the mind are nothing but ( unwitting ) representations of the flaws of the surrounding society , it is but a short step to proving it . In fact , as the late Peter Shaw notes in a recent Sewanee Review , " not only do the canonical works not advance the interests of ruling classes at all , but they also do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . They are much more likely to be oppositional than to embody conservative values , " The fact is that the " canon " has always comprised a highly diverse body of works each of which has evoked the most diverse interpretations . It defies reduction to anyone 's caricature of the " Western . " Repressive tolerance <p> Lastly , the axiom of cultural relativism that forbids us to pronounce one culture superior to another also forbids us to pronounce one " subculture " superior to another . Again , any such assertion is construed as an oligarchic power play . The result is that so-called popular culture gains in panache , whether interpreted as a conspiracy by which the people is oppressed , and which must therefore be debunked  --  popular culture as the new opiate of the masses  --  or as the means by which the people expresses its resistance to oppression . And indeed , if the main aim of criticism is sociological ( as is the case with " cultural studies " ) , yes , the Mickey Mouse Club was more typical of fifties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabloids parodied by Joyce were more typical of twenties Dublin than he was . Sociology ( including critical sociology ) has its place in the curriculum . The question is whether it ought to shape the core thereof . <p> In the absence of standards of high culture ( and in the presence of so powerful an animus against them ) , the curriculum risks degenerating into pandering to students in the guise of " raising their consciousness . " They may be encouraged to lift their sights as high as making a documentary of a Grateful Dead concert or to spend an entire semester contemplating the significance of black hair in America . Or they may be asked to confront an Aristotelian doctrine with an animistic one ( no matter how arbitrary the comparison ) , so as to be admonished that the former was " logocentric " ( a vice from which the latter was thankfully free ) . These are not hypothetical examples . I owe them to David Sacks and Peter Thiel , whose The Diversity Myth chronicles the decline of Stanford University . Others have amply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspires to a specific transformation of the curriculum and a corresponding one in the minds of the students subjected to it . At its heart is the advocacy not of cultural diversity but of a specific critique of Western culture . Its advocates view the liberation of students from their presumed bondage to Western culture as the highest purpose of higher education . In the decisive respect , then , the program of multiculturalism is not ecumenical but adversarial . Eurocentrism ranks with sexism , racism , and heterosexism as the cardinal sins on campus today , and the latter three are frequently presented as aspects of the former . <p> It is not surprising , then , that multiculturalism has spawned many encroachments on academic freedom . The valuable task of chronicling these has been ably performed by others , notably Dinesh D'Souza from a conservative perspective ( Illiberal Education ) and Richard Bernstein from a liberal one ( Dictatorship of Virtue ) . These abuses warrant grave concern , More often than not , however , multiculturalism can afford to be dismissive of the older learning rather than intolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , and how many divisions have they got ? Lockean multiculturalism ? <p> Among the defining decisions of the new Stanford CIV curriculum ( " Cultures , Ideas , and Values " ) was the displacement of John Locke from it . True , he was the classic exponent of the elements that came to define Western liberalism  --  representative and limited government , political , economic , and religious freedom , and an orientation toward economic growth  --  and the only such personage who had figured in the old core curriculum . Once one recognizes , however , that the whole canon consists of surreptitious legitimators of these odious practices , the presence of an explicit one is apparently de trop . <p> The Stanford decision was typical of the multiculturalist disparagement of the titans of Western thought . Yet Locke can still boast a constituency on campus today , even an ever growing one . As Tocqueville remarked that the Americans of his day were Cartesians without ever having studied Descartes , so today 's typical student is a Lockean without having studied Locke . This I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly " conservative . " It has little to do with what they think , and nothing to do with any attachment of theirs to the old . The so-called conservatism of today 's students is their immersion in their own narrow concerns . Their orientation ( at least within the university ) is toward the useful rather than the exciting , and their notion of the useful is an acquisitive one . They concur in Locke 's endorsement of homo economicus , but they do so almost apologetically  --  you have to look out for Number One  --  and without the slightest curiosity as to what he , or any other thinker , may have said in its justification . <p> It would be gratifying ( to me , at least ) to be able to tout this development as the revenge of the Lockean nerds . And in fact , those whose primary aim in attending university is the acquisition of employment skills are unlikely to be ardent multiculturalists . Ideology does n't interest them , and neither does culture . For these same reasons , however , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , it 's no skin off their backs . They view any course in the liberal arts as something to be endured and passed , preferably with as little trouble as possible . Multiculturalism possesses the charm of the progressive and often that of the easy too . ( This is especially so given the multiculturalist preoccupation with popular culture . ) Many such courses are taught by teachers whose affirmation of " difference " importantly includes the purveying of sameness  --  in the form of high grades for everybody . ( " I do n't think that I have ever given any one a C , if that helps with your course selection , " warbles a priestess of popular culture at Stanford . And why should she , given the multiculturalist critique of academic standards ? ) As for the student , he or she will now have more time to devote to courses that matter . In economics and chemistry , at least , Stanford is still Stanford . <p> There are , moreover , positive ( which is to say careerist ) inducements to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlook of ambitious students today is likely to be vaguely internationalist , that being where the economic opportunities are thought to lie . As " plastics " was the talisman urged upon the hero of The Graduate , so " the globalization of the economy " and " the information highway " are the mantras of today . And for the first of these lucrative pursuits , at least , a smattering of the " non-Western " is deemed to offer a useful foundation . <p> Even on the domestic front , both corporations and public bureaucracies ( including , of course , universities ) are persuaded of the necessity of " diversity training " not only for moral reasons but as a management and marketing imperative . And diversity training is what multiculturalism is all about . So accounting or computer science as the main course , with a little multiculturalism on the side , would seem to be a far more useful preparation for the " culture " that really matters to many students today  --  namely corporate-bureaucratic culture  --  than the study of Homer or the Bible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critique of commercial society , and their single-minded preoccupation with their careers , contributes to their acquiescence in a menu of multiculturalist course electives . Equally indifferent to the older type of liberal education , they will not object to multiculturalism 's domination of what has replaced it . It 's not as if they know any better . Multiculturalism and the decline of reading <p> Another factor , which collaborates with multiculturalism , is perhaps in the long run even more consequential for the fate of the North American university . It is the aversion of today 's students to reading . This last is an activity for which high schools no longer prepare them . Few have acquired a taste for reading complex texts , and fewer still the skills for it . Only in the last five years has it come to pass that most of the students in my large introductory course in political philosophy duck the readings ( all of which are in primary sources ) as simply too difficult for them . This majority is silent but sullen ; I ca n't help but suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not just my problem , as many colleagues in many places have corroborated it . <p> The current vogue in high schools is not for books . For many of today 's students , a book is just a data base waiting to be digitalized . While literature is of course still taught , it tends to feature contemporary short stories . As a result , the English of past centuries is a foreign language to today 's students . ( They would sooner read works in other languages , for these are at least available in translations into current English . ) <p> Even in the absence of ideological considerations , the older education was bound to suffer because of its dependence on books and the habits of rumination appropriate to them . While it would be foolish to predict the demise of the book , there is no overlooking its diminishing centrality to education and to the lives of the educated . The trivialization of university courses under the aegis of multiculturalism thus caters to the illiteracy of the students . <p> Yet ideological considerations are not absent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the high-school curriculum , it has favored the near total eclipse of Europe . It promotes the replacement of those older authors who are the glory of literature in English  --  the Swifts and the Dickenses and the Hawthornes  --  with easier ones deemed " relevant " ( and representative of the different strands of multiculturalism ) . Whether in high school or in university , multiculturalism makes the case not for the serious reading of old books but against it . <p> If there is one point that all schools of " cultural studies " hold in common , it is the denial that old books ( or any books ) can serve as permanent beacons for thoughtful human beings . It treats all writers and thinkers as Poe 's Montresor treated Fortunato : It immures them and leaves them to suffocate . The walls are the confines of their societies , and above all of its prejudices and iniquities , which God forbid that any one should ever be thought to have transcended . The greatest protagonists of the life of the mind become but relics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that culture is . Hence the fix is in for their displacement by representatives of today 's hot cultures , which is to say of multiculturalism . <p> As Allan Bloom has argued , this approach deprives the student of the requisite incentive to master the skills of reading old books . True , in studying these today , we are encouraged to note their complicity in the great historic offenses of the West ( sexism , heterosexism , etc . ) . Occasionally , we are even encouraged to see them as implying protests against these sins . But in neither of these cases do the books have anything essential to teach us ; when it comes to the issues of our own lives , we learn nothing that we did not know already , nothing but what the monotonous celebration of difference permits us to know . Reading old books leads to class discussions of the sort captured by Philip Roth in the lines that I chose as my epigraph  --  and such discussions reinforce , in their turn , students ' indifference to the books . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are simply artifacts of contemporary Western culture and therefore far more accessible to today 's students than the great works of past Western centuries . So multiculturalism does not involve the replacement of the familiar by the strange , but the replacement of the strange by the familiar . At the end of the day ( and even at the beginning of it ) , Edmund Spenser is a far stranger and more forbidding figure to today 's graduate of Scarsdale High than is Toni Morrison or Rigoberta Menchu  --  which is to say that he is ( as Arthur Melzer has remarked in the New Republic ) a far more " diverse " one . <p> If I am right that it is far easier , as well as apparently more useful and obviously more " relevant , " to study Morrison or Menchu than Spenser or Shakespeare , then one should not hope to find among students and parents a determined constituency for the defense of the older liberal education . It is always the case in democracy that the basic tastes in education are for the easy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only be students in rebellion from these tastes who will feel the charm of the older education . Some such students there will always be , but they too will feel the pull of multiculturalism . For the novelty , the radical egalitarianism , the Third World chic , and the rebellion against " Western values " preached by multiculturalism are bound to appeal to the young and the restless . <p> To teach the classics of Western thought has become ever more difficult in the past two decades . I would not , however , ascribe this primarily to the ethnic diversity of today 's students . Judging from my experience , most Chinese- or Korean-or Indian-Canadian students do not find the study of Plato or Hobbes or Nietzsche obviously more difficult than do their Anglo-Saxon counterparts . Even apart from the fact that recently many of my best , and most serious , students have been Asian Canadians , we should not exaggerate the handicap under which these labor . Innocent as many of them may be not only of the classics of Western civilization but of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hardly less so . This common ignorance is then the result not of having been born in Hong Kong but of having been educated in North America . It has less to do with multiculturalism as fact than with multiculturalism as policy , and less to do with either than with the decline of reading ( to which , however , multiculturalism contributes ) . Whatever the ethnic diversity among current students , their common uneasiness in the company of books is an element of uniformity among them , and must be explained as such . Two views of culture , two universities <p> The two views of culture yield two different relationships between the university and society . The newer notion , with its insistence on a variety of cultures coexisting within society , each of which has a quasi-political right to " representation " in the university , implies a university that is political ( and politicized ) at its core and to its peak . A university so conceived is responsive to society not only inasmuch as it provides it with the advanced vocational training and scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such " responsiveness " defines its highest intellectual mission . As Jimmy Carter preached a government that was " as good as the American people , " multiculturalism seeks a university that is as " diverse " as that people . <p> In principle , a university so understood leads society by following it . It sees itself as " progressive " to the extent that it is " culturally correct , " an accurate reflection of all of the diverse tendencies and constituencies in society which it is willing to legitimate as " cultures . " In practice , as I have argued , such a university aspires to lead society by discrediting what it takes to be the dominant " culture , " while empowering those previously " marginalized . " It is to this end that it forbids critical scrutiny of the claims of the latter , and it is to this end that it casts the giants of Western thought and art as running dogs of some prohibitedism . <p> The older notion of culture implies a university that offers a place for reflection upon society precisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . This was Arnold 's hope , difficult of attainment in his ( as in any ) society , and still more so in ours . Such a university seeks to lead society by shouldering the Arnoldian task of making the students whatever their background somewhat more cultured ( less conventional , less partisan , less the creatures of that background ) than they were when they entered . It requires in those who would undertake this task not only an education hard to come by these days but unremitting modesty and self-criticism . ( For it is true that only with the greatest difficulty does liberal education avoid complacency and unwitting complicity in ideology . ) At the summit , such a university aspires to foster at least a large handful of students capable of surveying society not through slits in the walls of their class , ethnic , or gender warrens but from a vantage point achieved through the study of figures who rise above such divisions . <p> This task will always be suspect in the eyes of society . If American universities enjoyed ( with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was only because these represented the peak of public acceptance of the notion that liberal education in the broader sense responded to the needs of liberal democracy . The pursuit of a human excellence that transcended democracy , so long as it was open to all , was not deemed incompatible with democracy and was even thought to crown it . ( Though Homer and Dante and Jane Austen were not democrats , they were presumed to speak to democrats . The current vogue for Austen , loving and ironic chronicler of a squirearchical way of life , suggests that this broader view of " relevance " remains accessible to us . ) The particular challenge facing the advocates of such an education today is to sustain this pursuit in the face of students who are ever more " diverse , " on the one hand , and ever more similar in their initial indifference and unpreparedness , on the other . <p> Such a neo-Arnoldian view might embrace not only a vast expansion of those to whom culture would now be available ( of which Arnold himself would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list of works most worthy of study . ( Arnold himself was a revisionist in matters of " the Canon . " ) All such controversy would grant , however , that the applicable standard was Arnold 's : that of enduring pre-eminence in addressing the human situation . It would imply permission to teach that certain thinkers and artists have walked this earth as representatives not of their nation , class , gender , and sexual orientation but of humanity as such . <p> By CLIFFORD ORWIN <p>
