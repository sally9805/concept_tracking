And if you wind up with indigestion , try these cures . // FOR MOST OF US , holiday time means a whole lot more than attending religious services , decorating the Christmas tree or lighting the menorah . The secular side of the season involves baking cookies and rich desserts , whipping up batches of eggnog and partying the month away . Sure , it sounds festive , but from our stomach 's point of view , it 's a disaster waiting to happen .
