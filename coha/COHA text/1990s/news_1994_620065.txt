<p> First in a series . An examination of incumbent Dianne Feinstein 's record will appear in tomorrow 's Chronicle . <p> Early in his campaign for the House of Representatives , Michael Huffington received a call from then-Vice President Dan Quayle , who urged him not to challenge the incumbent Republican . <p> " But Mr. Vice President , " Huffington recalled telling him , " I thought you were for term limits , I heard you say you were . And ( my opponent ) has been in office for 16 years . " <p> " Well , " Quayle explained , " he is my friend . " <p> Huffington , himself a Republican , ignored the vice president 's plea and went on to unseat House member and party stalwart Robert Lagomarsino in 1992 . Huffington said he had no tolerance for politics as usual , and vowed to change the ways of Washington . <p> " I did n't come here to be part of the old-boy , long-term network that sat around becoming chummy and passing legislation and voting up pork barrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview last spring . " ' I came here to break the mold . " <p> As the 103rd Congress nears its conclusion , Huffington has avoided falling victim to special interest or party politics , while maintaining an independent voting record that is often at odds with his party 's leadership . He donates his $ 133,644 annual salary to charity and refuses to give special treatment to businesses within his district . <p> But at the same time , Huffington 's independent voice has gone mostly unnoticed by his colleagues , and he has offered no initiatives to reform the system . <p> Of the 6,000 legislative measures presented in the House during the current session , Huffington has introduced just three . None has been scheduled for a hearing . <p> He rarely delivers speeches on the House floor , and is often quiet during committee meetings . And in a body where collegiality and deal-making are often the foundation for national policy , Huffington has made few friends . <p> LIMITED IMPACT <p> Whether it is because he is a Republican in a legislative body controlled by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governed by seniority , the freshman congressman from Santa Barbara is almost completely unknown even by those who keep a careful eye on the Capitol . <p> In spite of his lack of influence , and perhaps in part because of it , Huffington now has his eyes set on the U.S. Senate , where even a freshman member from the minority party has a chance to be heard . <p> Huffington turned down repeated requests to be interviewed about his legislative record  --  an unusual step for a candidate for statewide office . Even his staff declined to discuss his two years in office . <p> " I am sorry we are not able to accommodate your request at this time . We are very busy , " said Fleming Saunders , a Washington aide , when he was asked in August if Huffington or any member of his staff might be available to discuss his legislative record anytime over the next four weeks . <p> " His legislative record ? " exclaimed one staff member on the House Banking Committee on which Huffington serves , pausing at length to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not much . But being a Republican , and freshman in the House does n't offer one much opportunities . " <p> A diligent and sharp member , by most accounts , the former businessman is quick to grasp complex legislation . He faithfully attends constituent meetings , party caucuses and committee assignments and refrains from the partisan showmanship that often muddles the process . <p> Ideologically , he is conservative on fiscal matters and moderate on social issues , placing him somewhere in the center of California politics . <p> He has consistently voted against government spending , earning high marks from groups like Citizens Against Government Waste . He voted in favor of the North American Free Trade Agreement and has supported numerous measures to crack down on illegal immigration . <p> While such positions are typical of Republican lawmakers , Huffington is frequently among a small minority of party members to support social measures . He supported the Family Leave Act , which ensures maternity leaves for working mothers , and the right of gays to serve in the military . <p> SUPPORT FOR SOCIAL MEASURES <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assault weapon ban , and one of only five California Republicans to vote in favor of the Brady law , which imposed a waiting period on handgun purchases . <p> His penchant for independence has impressed some colleagues , while also raising questions about his ability to work harmoniously with members of his own party . <p> It was not surprising , for example , that he voted against the Democratic budget . But he did not vote for any of the three Republican alternatives either , saying that none of them went far enough in cutting spending  --  this despite the fact that even the most conservative deficit hawks supported an alternative by Gerald Solomon , R-New York , that would have eliminated the federal deficit by 1999 . <p> Huffington was also alone among the state 's 54 members of Congress in refusing to sign a February 1993 letter asking President Clinton for $ 1.4 billion in assistance for immigrants and refugees . He later said the request was not large enough , and sent a letter of his own . <p> Although Huffington 's voting record places him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to attack from both sides . <p> For example , he supports some environmental legislation , such as a ban on drilling off the California coast . But he opposes the Desert Protection Act , which would set aside millions of acres of the Mojave Desert as national parkland . <p> He supports abortion rights , and supported the lifting of the gag rule that prohibited doctors in federal clinics from discussing abortion with their patients . At the same time , he supported the Hyde Amendment , which eliminated federal financing for abortions , and earned just a 20 percent rating on his voting record from the National Abortion Rights Action League . <p> On the recently debated crime legislation , he originally voted in favor of the bill and the assault weapon ban . Then , after billions of dollars in crime prevention programs were added and the issue exploded into a partisan controversy , he voted to prevent the bill from reaching the House floor . After nearly $ 3 billion was trimmed from the final bill , Huffington voted for it . <p> The few measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One would amend the tax code to disallow the deduction for advertising and promotion of tobacco products . Huffington has long been a crusader against the tobacco industry , instituting a smoking ban in his Houston office in the mid-1980s . <p> Another measure would make contributions to charitable organizations tax deductible , even for people who do not itemize their tax returns . Huffington , who is worth an estimated $ 70 million , has long been an advocate for volunteer donations . <p> The only other bill written by Huffington was a local measure to include Morro Bay , which is within his district , in the National Estuary Program . <p> DEFENSE OF RECORD <p> In speeches and statements throughout the year , he has defended his failure to introduce more bills . Rather than showing a lack of productivity , he said , it is evidence of his desire to cut government 's role in private lives . <p> " Most of this legislative activity amounts to little more than reshuffling the deck chairs on the Titanic , " he said . <p> Huffington has been largely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says health care reform is needed but has refused to support any of the current bills . <p> The congressman is strongly opposed to the employer mandates and taxes that would finance most Democratic health care plans , but has not indicated how he would finance an alternative . <p> When his banking committee conducted hearings on Whitewater , Huffington asked questions but remained largely in the background . <p> Even if it is not apparent in Washington , Huffington sees himself as a rebel , " taking on the business-as-usual , good-old-boy network . " <p> Recalling the bad taste that was left from his conversation with Quayle , Huffington said , " I got a feel for how the process worked . I think it 's fine to have friends , but I do n't think you should put friendship over democracy . " <p> " I had almost every congressman and senator from California , and the president and the vice president against me  --  in my own party , " he recalled in the spring interview . " That makes you very independent . You have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> HUFFINGTON 'S RECORD <p> . <p> Where Representative Michael Huffington stands on the issues : <p> . <p> * HEALTH CARE : Huffington says reform is needed but has refused to support any of the current bills . He is strongly opposed to the employer mandates and taxes that would finance most Democratic health care plans , but has not indicated how he would finance an alternative . <p> * ENVIRONMENT : He supports a ban on drilling off the California coast . But he opposes the Desert Protection Act , which would set aside millions of acres of the Mojave Desert as national parkland . <p> * ABORTION : He supports abortion rights , and he supported the lifting of the gag rule that prohibited doctors in federal clinics from discussing abortion with their patients . At the same time , he supported the Hyde Amendment , which eliminated federal financing for abortions , and earned just a 20 percent rating on his voting record from the National Abortion Rights Action League . <p> * CRIME BILL : Huffington originally voted in favor of the just- passed crime bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars of crime prevention programs were added , and the issue exploded into a partisan controversy , he voted to prevent the bill from reaching the House floor . He then voted in favor of the final bill after nearly $ 3 billion was trimmed .
