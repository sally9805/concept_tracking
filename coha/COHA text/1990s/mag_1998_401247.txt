The good , the bad and the ugly on natural cover-ups. // Growing up in a chemical-free home , I vowed never to dye my hair . I 'd wear my gray proudly , I said , like a testament to natural living and pride in my age , experience and accomplishments . Then came the morning , about five years ago , when I actually found a few of those unsightly strands . They seemed to pop up overnight , striping my dark brown mane and mocking my resolve . I kissed my pride goodbye and made a beeline for the hairdresser . In a nation obsessed with youth and beauty , changing hair color is nearly as commonplace as changing clothes . Three out of every five American women aged 18 to 55 now tint their locks , according to the Cosmetic Toiletry and Fragrance Association ( CTFA ) . But recent studies linking hair color with an increase in certain cancers are making women rethink this rite of passage . A study done by the University of Washington and published in the American Journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dye their hair have a 50 percent greater risk of developing nonHodgkin 's lymphoma . A 1994 study conducted by the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the American Cancer Society suggested an association between prolonged use ( 20 years or more ) of darker dyes and cancer . But that study is being updated , says Sheila Zahn , deputy director at the division of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the National Cancer Institute , because the number of participants was too small for a definitive conclusion . What makes hair dyes harmful ? In a word : chemicals . To achieve luscious shades of chestnut brown or mahogany , permanent hair dyes must contain both color and a developer . The developer actively lifts the outside covering ( or " cuticle " ) of the hair , allowing easier access for the color to penetrate . Sounds simpleexcept that the developer contains a not-so-simple ( or healthy ) combination of peroxide and ammonia , which not only alters the molecular structure of hair and damage it , but may cause allergic reactions . While these chemicals are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with chemical sensitivities . Permanent dyes also contain tiny but potentially harmful petrochemicals ( like coal tar ) , which , like developer , penetrate the hair shaft to deposit color . Women may have been willing to take-or overlook-this risk in the past , but today there are several options to conventional hair dyes . Marketed as less damaging to hair and less toxic to the body , natural hair color products are proving to be a big hit with consumers , who are snatching dye-it-yourself kits off the shelves and requesting " natural " coloring at their hair salons . According to Susan Babinsky , vice president of consumer products for Kline &; Company , a New Jersey market research firm , retail and professional salon sales of natural hair dyes account for 10 percent of the annual $1.25 billion hair dye market . These natural colors are certainly a giant step in the right direction , but at the heart of the issue lies an inherent dilemma . The more " natural " a product is ( i.e. , the fewer chemicals it has ) , the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the more chemicals it contains . And because no dyes ( neither synthetic nor natural ) are regulated by the FDA , brands that call themselves natural and claim to be safe and effective may actually contain as many-and as harmful-toxins as the synthetics . WHAT 'S RIGHT FOR YOU Like their synthetic counterparts , natural colors come in three different categories : permanent , semi-permanent and temporary . Valerie Banda , master colorist and artistic director of David 's Beautiful People Salon in Rockville Pike , Md. , explains : " The treatment you choose depends on what you want to achieve . A natural permanent is ideal for someone with 50 percent gray hair , as it offers the most extensive coverage . Because permanents contain around 3 percent peroxide , you can lighten or darken your hair . Basically , the lighter you 're going , the higher the level of toxins . So it 's best to stick with a color close to your own shade . And since permanent color does n't wash out , it will last around four to six weeks , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need to " retouch " the new growth . " Natural semi-permanents and temporary colors usually contain less peroxide or ammonia ( 1 to 3 percent ) but do n't penetrate the hair shaft . Because they just deposit the color into your hair , they wo n't totally cover gray and will slowly fade out after 12 to 16 shampoos . " This is a good choice for women who just want to blend in a few gray hairs , " says Banda . Temporary rinses contain nothing but straight color pigment , but must be reapplied after each shampoo . THE SAFETY DEBATE Photograph // Natural hair dyes do provide rich , longlasting color with fewer chemicals . " But to get long-lasting color , you need chemicals , and some products have more than others , " says Jim Douglass , national sales manager for Antica , maker of Herbatint and Vegetal brands of natural color . " Today , " natural " means whatever the consumer perceives it to be , " warns John Bailey , Ph.D. , director of the FDA 's color and cosmetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figuring out what 's in these products , but it 's by no means perfect . " When pressed , experts ranging from the FDA to the manufacturers themselves admit that few " natural " hair dyes , if any , are 100 percent natural . In fact , a quick label scan of some popular health store brands reveals that most contain two FDA-reviewed carcinogens : **27;83;TOOLONG ( 4-MMPD ) and **27;112;TOOLONG sulphate ( 4-MMPD sulphate ) , as well as other chemicals generally believed to be harmful , including : Resorcinol , O-Aminophenol , Ethan-olamine , Propylene Glycol , Nonoxynol . John Corbett , Ph.D. , vice president of the CTFA 's scientific and technical affairs committee , says , " If a natural product contains words like amino , nitro or phenyl or names of colors starting with the letters HC , the product is not natural . " But not everybody is convinced of the dangers . New York-based Christopher Mackin , one of the country 's top three tricologists ( hair and scalp specialist ) , argues that the risks of natural hair color are minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwartzkopf , Europe 's premier hair and skin manufacturer , and with the Phillip Kingsley Tricology Clinic in New York , says , " I put my reputation on the line by saying that products calling themselves natural are pretty safe . If you lead a healthy lifestyle , have a good diet and a good genetic profile , 3 percent peroxideabout the max a natural permanent hair dye contains-wo n't hurt . In my opinion , the only way dye will get into your body is if your scalp has an allergic reaction and dyes penetrate your bloodstream . Plus , think about it : Cigarettes come with warning labels from the Surgeon General . Hair dye ? No warning label required . " My advice is to check the label carefully , " Macklin continues . " You want less than 10 percent peroxide because more than that will go into the cuticle . Also , look for phrases like not damaging to hair ' and ingredients you recognize as naturally based , such as rosemary and birchwood . And go with a well-known brand . " On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cancer Institute 's Sheila Zahn : " Based on what we now know , natural hair dyes are a safer choice . But avoid products with coal tar , which has been found to contain human carcinogens . " LESS IS MORE Natural dyes that mix plant pigments with some chemical fixatives are a good compromise for women who want lasting color , without the chemical overload of synthetic dyes . On a toxicity scale of one to 10 , with 10 representing the highest level of chemical content , these products rate between six and nine . They contain the same kinds of ingredients used in synthetic hair color-just less of them . They offer a wide selection of reliable colors that typically last four to six weeks . " The closer you come to your natural color , the longer you can go , " says Banda . " In general , you should touch your roots up every month , and re-dye the whole head every second or third time , depending on how faded the color is . " Because these dyes contain developer , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since chemical content varies from product to product . A different-and even more cautious-approach to covering gray is to use natural dye only for highlights . Annie Berthold-Bond , author of Better Basics : Solutions for a Simple and Less Toxic Way of Life ( due out next spring from Random House ) , says , " I like the look so much , I 'll never go back to regular hair color . " Furthermore , since there are different shades of color in the hair , new growth blends in , requiring less frequent touch-ups . The best methods for applying highlights , according to Valerie Banda , are with a professional frosting cap or foil . " That technique involves painting the color on very fine pieces with a brush and wrapping them in foil , " she explains . " But it 's difficult to do on your own because the color can come out uneven . " Permanent colors are best for highlights , " she continues . " While they usually contain higher chemical levels , they also include vitamin or conditioning buffers to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ammonia , so they ca n't lighten , but they can add darker highlights ( or " lowlights ' ' ) . It does n't pay to use temporary highlights since they 'll wash out by the next day . " Highlights are best for women with less than 50 percent gray , she adds , since they do n't provide full coverage . Perhaps the most natural highlighting product is in your fridge , says Mackin . " Put some lemon juice into a spray bottle , spritz into your hair , sit in the sun for an hour or two , and let nature take its course . " PURELY PLANTS Along those same lines is the world of plantbased dyes , made from leaves , roots and barks . To ensure that a product is plant-based , look for the words cellophane ( a vegetable protein ) or vegetable protein-based on the label . These dyes work by coating the hair shaft rather than penetrating it and do n't require harsh chemicals to make the color stick . The best known plant dye is henna , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lawsonia inermis , native to North Africa , Asia and Australia . Henna has been used for centuries throughout the Middle East and India to color hair , nails and decorate the body . Considered the safest natural hair coloring commercially available , henna may also be the simplest : there are no variations of permanent , semi or temporary colors . It will eventually fade out after four to six weeks , but because there are no harsh chemicals , recoloring is n't so worrisome . Women like it because in addition to adding color , it gives body , strength and thickness . Plus , it 's the only colorant to have been safety-approved by the FDA . " Henna is best for women with allergies to other dyes or who have coarse hair because it smoothes it down , " says Banda . Since there 's no guarantee that henna wo n't produce an allergic response , before using it for the first time , Banda recommends " doing a patch test on the inside of your arm or behind your ear . You 'll know if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the cheerleading , some women say henna has unique problems of its own . They claim that it does n't cover gray and washes out fast and that it can make hair dry and brassy and turn white hair blue . But proper use should overcome these obstacles . To minimize dryness , says Mindy Green , director of educational services for Boulder , Colo. - based Herb Research Foundation , mix henna so it 's the consistency of wet cake batter , then add either an egg or a teaspoon of olive oil to seal in moisture . Applying henna to wet hair and rinsing it out within two hours also helps eliminate dryness . Better yet , apply henna in two applications , says Rose Huling , a buyer for the Whole Foods flagship store in Austin , Texas . Mix up one bag , apply to hair and let it sit for 30 to 45 minutes . Then wash it out , mix up another bag and reapply . The first batch lays down the base , the next lays color over it so it holds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost the color of brown henna and indigo paste to enhance black henna . As for covering gray , Harriet Farish , vice president of Rainbow Research Corp. , a henna manufacturer in Bohemia , N.Y. , mixes medium brown and dark brown henna with coffee ( not boiling water ) to create richer color , then adds apple cider vinegar as a fixative . The color should last about five to six weeks . " I 'm 52 , have gray hair and you 'd never know it , " she says .
