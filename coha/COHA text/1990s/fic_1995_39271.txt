Socorro was a ratty little town that dangled off the highway the way a broken leg hangs off a dog that 's been hit by a car . It was mostly dirt , sand , red grass , and squat cactus , peppered with little brown houses that might as well have been ovens . Jen and I had planned a driving trip to see some places where there 'd been UFO sightings in New Mexico , but we 'd picked up her father , Mike , and a college friend named Penny along the way , so it was n't quite the trip we 'd planned . Mike was short and bristly and Penny was lanky , long-haired , and angry about men . Fortunately , both Mike and I were near fifty , him on the top side , me on the other , so we were n't quite men in Penny 's sense of the word . <p> We 'd been through Roswell and Corona , and the next place to see was Socorro , because of the alien craft that landed there in 1964 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer , a tiny Compaq she used to link up to e-mail services when we stopped overnight , and she had been writing notes to herself about Socorro all afternoon . <p> " First we find the site , " she said , " then we go after Lonnie Zamora and Sergeant Chavez . Everybody O.K. with that ? " <p> " They sound like a couple of real dweebers , " Penny said . " What 's their deal , anyway ? " <p> " Zamora saw the spaceship and Chavez came in later and saw the traces  --  burning bushes and all that , " Jen said . " It 's a big deal because the Air Force did n't write it off . " <p> " Typical , " Penny said . <p> We found the spot out of town where the deputy had seen he UFO . That was pretty easy . The UFO had supposedly landed there in this gully , and these little men were standing around it , and then when Zamora got out of his car or something the men got back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot marked with a big sign . But when we tried to find the Zamora himself , that was n't so easy . Everybody we talked to had a different idea of where he lived . In fact , some people had different ideas of who he was , which made tracking him difficult . What we did was cruise up and down the dusty , chuck-hole filled roads , sliding in and out of stringy subdivisions . We knocked on a few doors and finally ran into some people having a chicken picnic in the dirty sand that was their front yard . They invited us to join them , but we declined , though it looked to me like Penny was interested . <p> " We 're trying to find the guy who saw the UFO , " Jen said to an older , skinny man with a rubber-like complexion and a bum leg that seemed to point toward the other leg whenever he tried to walk . The Charlton Heston thing . <p> " Everybody 's seen them , " the guy said . " They 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you see one . " <p> " Have you seen any ? " Jen said . <p> " Well , I have n't , " he said . " Not me , personally . But everybody else I know has . " <p> " I hear that , " Penny said . " Lot of young bright men seeing UFOs every day . " <p> " We 're looking for Lonnie Zamora , " Jen said . " Or Chavez , the state cop . You know them ? " <p> " There 's a cop lives around the corner there , " the guy said waving off to one side . " But he 's new , just got here in town last year . He 's from Anchorage , I think . May be an Eskimo , or have some Eskimo blood . That 's what I heard , anyway . " <p> The guy was standing knock-kneed in his front yard holding a quarter chicken by the end of the drumstick . One bite of chicken about halfway down the leg was already gone . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of invitation . His wife and their kids , all of whom seemed extraordinarily tiny , much tinier than they ought to have been , almost like circus tiny  --  the wife was maybe four and a half feet tall , the kids were smaller  --  were back by the folding table on top of which was a fat pitcher of blue Hawaiian Punch . I figured it had to be Hawaiian Punch or Kool-Aid because it was blue , but these folks look like the Hawaiian Punch crowd . The kids were slurping this stuff out of giant lock-top plastic glasses that had elaborate roller-coaster straws coming out of them . <p> On the card table there was a boom box that plugged into an orange extension cord that slid back across the dirt , up over the porch rail , and into the front door that was cocked open a little . They had old-fashioned ballroom music swinging out of the boom box , dance music , and both the elders  --  him tall and skinny and her small as a medium-size dog up on its hind legs  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening to dance in the driveway . We waved as Mike dropped the car back into gear and let us roll away . <p> " That poor woman got stuck and stuck hard , " Penny said , shaking her head . <p> Apparently the town council had tried to set up a tourist deal in Socorro like the one in Roswell , but it had n't worked out . They had a Spaceship Cleaners , a Fourth Dimension Cafe , and , on the way out of town , a homemade fast-food place called Out of This World , but that was about it for UFO-marketing . O-O-T-W , as its neon said , looked like a Dairy Queen that 'd been caught between a couple of giant pieplates and then rolled in car aerials and whip antennas covered with SuperStik . The parking lot was spray painted a remarkable golf-grass green . We stopped in the drive-through and Penny got their specialty , a Littlegreenmanburger , She told Jen she did n't know whether to eat it or smack it so hard it blistered . <p> It was turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ready to pack it in , find a local motel , but Jen wanted to visit the UFO Museum , so we drove two blocks and parked nose-in at the storefront museum . <p> Inside , a retired postal worker from Cleveland did his best to explain the Philadelphia Experiment  --  those cables wrapped around that ship , the space in the water where the ship had been , anti-matter machines , all of that . He had wiry hair and wore his jeans nipple-high , and he was eager to please  --  a volunteer , he explained , at the museum . He was reluctant to let us browse without instruction . The place was the size of a shoe shop , three rooms , the largest arranged around a long folding display board with photos , texts , crummy sketches of flying saucers pinned to it . In a side chamber there was a four-foot-high wooden alien with teardrop eyes and several coats of Testor 's Alien Lumina Silver . We listened to the retiree tell us about the rash of sightings in 1947 and about how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was quick to put the kibosh on the Air Force 's new bonehead spy balloon explanation of the original coverup , too . There were snapshots of the Brazel ranch where the Corona UFO crashed , but the property looked like nothing special , just dirt , like the rest of New Mexico . <p> " You see , " the guy said . " In 1947 there were sightings all over this country  --  way up in Washington and Oregon , all the way down here , over to Alabama , up toward Minnesota , in New York State  --  they were everywhere . Strange lights , abductions , interactions , exchanges of fluids  --  I mean priests , nurses , even military officers reported stuff . For several weeks in the summer of 1947 this went on and then it suddenly stopped . " <p> At that , the retiree did a deliberate pause , a long pause , nodding , watching us with a shrewd smile . <p> " It stopped , " he repeated . " What does that tell you ? What does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reason . It says they got what they wanted and they left . " He slapped his hands together for emphasis . " Bam " he said . " You have to keep up with these deals , or you miss everything . You have to think back to what happened in 1947 . Who was born that year ? What world historical events were precipitated by incidents that occurred then ? What was invented in the year 1947 ? These kinds of things are the kinds of things you have to think about when you 're trying to keep an eye on the big picture . Where there 's smoke , there 's fire  --  that 's all we are saying . " <p> " Amen , " Jen said . " But what about that magic aluminum foil , you know ? And where are the tiny purple I-beams ? " <p> " Oh , a TV watcher , huh ? " he said , shaking his head . " Well , they were n't purple , they were magenta , and where do you think ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Area 51  --  you know Area 51 ? " <p> " Where some aliens were held captive , right ? " she said . " But somebody discovered there really was n't any Area 51 , it was all <p> hoax . " <p> He smiled and took a look at his black shoes . " Oh , there 's an Area 51 , all right . And a Hangar 9 . There was n't any Hangar 54 , maybe that 's what you 're thinking about , that 's more TV stuff , but there were Rainbow , Phoenix , and Montauk projects . And there 's S4 , MJ-12 , Zeta-Reticula , and there are underground hangars at Kelly  --  there ' s a lot out here . If you 're interested , check into Groom Lake , check out the Vegas airport sometime , the white jets without markings that go into the desert at night . " He thumped his temple . " Do n't let ' em confuse you . " <p> Penny 's eyebrows were doing Groucho moves . She pointed out toward the lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike slipped off with her , leaving me and Jen to listen to the Socorro story , how the deputy had been driving along , minding his own business , kind of a pleasant evening , enjoying himself after work when he 'd seen this craft in a ravine just outside of town  --  the full story . While he was talking I read the actual front page of the Roswell newspaper the day the Army put out the story that it had recovered a saucer . I knew the story , but seeing the paper , yellowed and brittle and hiding under glass , gave me a new sense of that time , made it seem as if the world was a toy world back then . The way the story sounded , the people it talked about and quoted , what they said , how they said it , even the people you could imagine reading the paper  --  they must 've been like kids in adult bodies running things . That was a little eerie . <p> The museum was strange in the same way . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there was something edgy and nagging about the pencil drawings and the snapshots with their rippled edges and the Xeroxes of typewritten accounts , something that made you uneasy  --  why was this enterprise still so ragtag after all these years ? I stared at sketches supposedly done by the medical examiner during the autopsies of the Corona aliens , at <p> photo of the supposed Socorro deputy pointing at the place where he 'd seen the aliens  --  there was a dotted marker line showing the path of the departing spacecraft  --  and I began to think that in spite of , or maybe because of , the farfetched and unconvincing displays , the UFO Museum was entirely disturbing . <p> About then the retiree rubbed his hands together and looked around , as if scanning for something else to tell us . " I guess that gives you a start on it , huh ? " he said . " Why not kind of meander around and get your own sense of the place now that I 've introduced you ? That be O.K. ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When he was gone I said , " I envy him  --  living here , volunteering here , explaining everything to the tourists . " <p> " Yeah , " she said . " Cool job . " <p> " Like the details of Corona , or the Philadelphia Experiment , or Groom Lake . Would n't it be great to go home every night and read new stories , watch bad video copies , go through new evidence compiled and distributed by the Society for Recognition of the Adaptations of Alien Life Forms ? " <p> " S-R-A-A-L-F , " she said . <p> " Yeah , " I said . " Or just sit out on a dusty porch in the middle of nowhere and stare at the saucer-filled sky . " <p> " You 're a wonderful person , Del , " Jen said . <p> " Well , he 's like those guys who spend twenty years building railroads in their basements , who really do n't do anything but play with their trains . They live perfect lives , devoted to love . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fifties deal . " Come to me , baby . " She gave me a playful and sexy hug . <p> I watched as the little guy stood at the front window for a minute talking to another volunteer , then he cornered three new tourists  --  husband and wife with child . The retiree took them on , brought them into the main room and then to one of the side spaces where he 'd originally taken us . I heard him start his speech about the anti-matter machine , how even he did n't quite understand it , but he would try to explain it to them if they could picture this massive World War II battleship wrapped in miles of thick steel cable  --  cable as thick as your arm  --  the ship tossing in the stormy ocean waves on a bleak , wintry night , rain coming in visible sheets , and then , suddenly , without warning , in a wash of lightning the ship vanishes , leaving an indentation in the water , a footprint in the shape of its great hull . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd finished the museum and were climbing back into the car . It was beginning to get dark . <p> " If we stay here we can try to find Zamora tomorrow , " Mike said . " I mean , get the story first hand . " <p> " He 's another guy who ai n't ready for us , " Penny said . <p> " You figure he ought to be standing out here on the highway ? " Mike said . <p> " That 'd be a start , " Penny said . <p> " Dad , " Jen said . " We 're hitting the road . " <p> So Penny took the driver 's seat and we headed back down Highway 25 to the place where we could catch a state road to Arizona . In the dusk we could still see the mountains on either side of us , tall solid hulks criss-crossing the road up ahead . There was a big stream running down one side of the highway , silver , reflecting lights from the little cabins alongside it . Pretty soon we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smaller and the stream was gone and there were n't any houses , just a big , black hump squeezing the highway . We had n't done much night driving and I was thinking that was too bad , because things seemed more comfortable in the car at night . The inside seemed a lot bigger . There was territory there between the riders , and the car was cooler and quieter . The road was n't making so much noise , and the-noise it did make was more soothing in darkness than daytime . Looking out the front window at the white lines edging the road and the yellow lines in its center , I had a vivid sense of riding on a seam , an edge between two voids , a track pointed somewhere , coming from somewhere , lit only by headlights . The big Lincoln seemed to shoot itself forward into that night . The few lights in the hills were glittering on the windshield . Headlights jiggled as they came toward us , and the reflectors embedded in the highway threw our brights back in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then by brand-new sections of divided highway . These sections did n't make any sense , there was n't a pattern to their appearance or disappearance . We 'd drive a while and then suddenly there 'd be a mile of divided highway , then back to blacktop . We passed a hut on the side of the road renting trailers , and our lights caught the taillights of all the trailers at once , making them look like a herd of small animals cowering there in the ditch alongside the highway . <p> Jen pulled out the Compaq and said , " I 'm going to read your tarot . I got this program off the Net . " <p> " I 'd rather watch TV , " I said . We 'd been carrying Jen 's handheld TV , a Casio the size of a Walkman with a two-and-a-half-inch color LCD , but I had n't seen it for a while . " Where is that TV , anyway ? I want to check what 's on . " <p> " Maybe you could tune in some aliens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaceships always gray out the screen ? " She and Mike , in the front seat , giggled about that . <p> " It 's in the trunk , probably , " Jen said , cranking up the computer . " But wait 'll you see this  --  Celtic cross , a couple other spreads , and it explains everything , so when you get the Death card , I can explain the hell out of it . " <p> " Death is just another word for nothing left to lose , " Penny said . " Death is never having to say you 're sorry . " <p> " Oh , Penny , " Jen said . " You 're always so negative . " She ran the program and asked me to shuffle the cards by punching a couple of keys . " You can stop whenever you want to , " she said . <p> " How do I know the cards are shuffling under there ? " I said . <p> " You trust me , " she said . <p> So I stopped and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your cards . " The notebook had a trackball , which made picking out the cards difficult , but I got it done . <p> " Are you ready ? " She moved the cursor to a button that said " Reveal " and clicked . The first card in the center of the cross rolled over . Death . I shook my head . <p> " That 's great , " Jen said . " Death 's a really great card to get in that position . It 's all about starting a new part of your life , putting the things of your past behind you and going forward , reaching out to conquer new challenges , stepping out of old , bad habits , leaving your worn clothes behind . It 's a wonderful sign , really . It 's about the best card you could possibly ever get in that position . " <p> " Short of a letter bomb , " Penny said . <p> " O.K. , " Jen said . " I wo n't kid you . There is a downside . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . If it were up in the fourth house that would be a problem . I 'd tell you that , too , I 'd just come right out and tell you , but here , at the center of everything , it 's a very , very good sign . " She clicked on a button to bring up the explanation of the Death card . " See here , " she said , pointing at the screen . " It says right here that ' the Death card represents the clearing of the old to usher in the new and , therefore , should be welcomed as a positive , cleansing , transformative force in our lives . ' " <p> " Let 's do it again , " I said . <p> " What do you mean , do it again ? You ca n't just do it again , " she said . <p> " Give him another chance , " Penny said . <p> " Let 's shuffle and do it again , " I said . <p> " Are you sure ? " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " That 's the ticket , " Penny said . She was watching us in the rearview , bobbing her- head around to see me , then to see Jen . <p> So Jen clicked on the " Shuffle " button , and we went through the whole process again , dealing another set of ten cards . This time when she clicked on " Reveal " the first card that came up was the Devil . <p> " What is it ? " Penny said . <p> " Progress , " I said . " Satan . " <p> Jen clicked the " Interpret " button and read parts of it out loud . " ' The Devil represents hidden forces of negativity that constrain us and deceive us into thinking we 're imprisoned by external forces , ' " she said . " There 's a devil in each of us . He 's like an inner force . He 's an embodiment of our fears , addictions , and harmful impulses . ' " She pointed to the screen picture of the card . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ' entranced with the paralyzing fear of his illusory power and therefore stand there and look numb . ' " <p> " Dumb ? " Penny said . <p> " Hush , " Jen said . " But see , the chains hang loosely so they can break free of their hypnotic attachment if they really want to , if they have the will . That means you can , too . " <p> " This is worse than last time , " I said . <p> " Well , maybe , " she said . " But there 's a way it 's better  --  a cleaner beginning , a solid ground against which to work . " <p> " Why do n't you go ahead and turn over the next card ? " Penny said . " Take it one card at a time . " <p> Jen clicked on the button to turn over the second card and the second card was Death . <p> " One of the most fruitful and positive cards in the deck , " I said . <p> " Death ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . " Sorry , Del . I was rooting for you . Honest . " <p> " Watch the road , will you ? " I said . <p> " This is not good , " Jen said . " I think maybe we want to move away from this spread . " <p> The third card was the Hierophant . Jen said , " Let 's just take <p> peek at what 's here , not really taking this one seriously any more , but just to see  --  " She clicked through the rest of the cards . I had the Emperor in the recent past , the Moon and the Crown , the Wheel of Fortune in the future , and the other four cards were the Chariot , the Hanged Man , Judgment , and the Magician . " Now , this is n't really so bad , " Jen said . " It looked a little iffy there at the beginning , but as it plays out , it 's not so bad . I 've seen worse than this . " <p> " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Penny said . <p> " I ' 11 save it and we can look again later , O.K. ? " Jen said . " You do n't believe in this stuff anyway . " <p> " I believe in everything , " I said . " A little bit in everything . " <p> Jen shut the computer down and slipped it back into the bag she had in the footwell on her side of the car . <p> " Penny , " she said . " Where are we ? " <p> " Thirty-one miles from Pie Town , " Penny said . <p> " Is that all ? " Jen said . " What are you doing ? Eighty ? " <p> " Something like that , " Penny said . <p> Mike stirred and I realized he 'd been asleep with his head pressed against the window glass . Penny waved a hand to hush us and Jen turned sideways in the seat , resting against the door on her side and running her feet across my lap into the door on my side . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Penny waved again . <p> Jen said , " I want to wake up in Pie Town . Just the idea is great . Maybe the idea is greater than actually doing it even . But I want to do it . I 'm beginning to like this traveling stuff , this touring around and seeing stuff . " She gave me a little kick . " Do n't you like it ? " <p> " Yes , I like it . I told you I liked it , " I said . <p> " Could you guys whisper ? " Penny said from the front . " The oldster is napping . " <p> " I think it 's worthy , " Jen whispered . <p> Up in the front Penny sneezed a couple times and then looked up into the rearview to see if we were watching her . <p> Mike sighed , his head still against the window . " Why is everybody making so much noise ? " he said . <p> " Maybe we should call ahead to Pie Town and see if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder . <p> " Why do n't you ? " Mike said . He slipped the cellular phone over the back of the seat . <p> " I guess we ca n't , " Jen said . " We 'd have to call information and get somebody and ask about motels  --  they 're not having a Holiday Inn in Pie Town . " <p> " So why are you asking me ? " he said . He was still bent against the car door . <p> " Wake you up , " Jen said . <p> " We 'll just get something when we get there , " Penny said . " It 's not going to hurt if we do n't call . " <p> " Let me have the phone , " I said . " I 'm calling somebody . " <p> " Here we go , " Jen said . <p> " I do n't have to if you do n't want me to , " I said . <p> " No , go ahead , " she said . <p> " Go ahead , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should call that guy back at the museum , " Penny said . " Maybe he 's seen some spacecraft . " <p> " Is that the nicest thing you could possibly think of to say ? " Jen said . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Penny said . <p> Jen patted my arm . " Go ahead . Call anybody you want . It 's a free country . I 'll join our fellows up front , give you some privacy . " Jen leaned forward over the back of the seat and put an arm around Penny and an arm around Mike . " So , what 's up guys ? " she said . <p> I dialed our number at home thinking I 'd check for messages as a first step , but the radio waves got crossed up or something and I ended up connected to a guy on a Continental Airways flight from L.A. to New York who was trying to call his mother in Akron . I told him I 'd never talked to anybody on an airplane telephone before . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 'd been to Roswell and to the UFO Museum in Socorro , and that we were headed into a place called Pie Town . He told me he thought he 'd seen a UFO once , down in Costa Rica , but he was n't sure . He told me his mom had a sixth sense about the paranormal , out of body travel , the Rapture , mind locks , all that stuff , and that she was always sending him those covers off the National Enquirer or the Star where they make babies the size of houses , or put beautiful models ' heads on giant snake bodies . " She thinks it 's all true , " the guy said . " I tell her ' Mom , it ' s trick photography , ' but she wo n't buy that . She says that things are happening we ca n't even imagine , that the world is a constantly developing eruption . She says we 'll be lucky if we last until the turn of the century . " <p> Outside the car window the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the phone and the connection ratcheted in and out . I listened to static for a couple minutes , sat there waiting for things to come clear . After a while it was just a dead line and I was there with the cell phone stuck to my ear , listening . I was thinking maybe this guy 's mother was n't that far wrong . <p>
