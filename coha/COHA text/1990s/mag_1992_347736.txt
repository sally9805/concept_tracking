MORE THAN 80% OF U.S. DRY CLEANERS RELY ON THE solvent PCE ( perchloroethylene ) , a chemical that is listed under the Clean Air Act as a hazardous air pollutant . Perc , as it is commonly known , can cause dizziness and headaches in workers , and some controversial studies link it to miscarriage and cancer . Perc is also fingered for contaminating underground water systems as well as apartments and restaurants adjacent to dry-cleaning establishments . <P> About 40% to 45% of the estimated 500 million pounds of perc produced annually is used by cleaners . In an effort to reduce exposure to perc , the Environmental Protection Agency , in collaboration with trade groups , has launched a four-week test of a new cleaning method that eschews all chemical solvent and depends instead on biodegradable soaps along with heat , steam and pressing . The experiment uses clothing volunteered by government employees in Washington and New York City . First up was EPA chief William Reilly , who turned over his regulation blue suit .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
