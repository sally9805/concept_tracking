Last year , unfortunately , we missed our unofficial baseball issue . This year , it looks as if we might again . But we have a few baseball stories in our inventory and one of them is a spring training story . So we are publishing " Where Garagiola Waits " before the baseball season begins , because that 's when the story takes place . <p> Rick Wilber , who has published dozens of short stories and poems in a wide range of sf and mainstream magazines , is the son of a professional baseball player . His father played for the Cardinals , Red Sox and Phillies in the late forties and mid-fifties . Then he coached , scouted , and managed in the minors . Rick drew on his father 's reminiscences , and his father-in-law 's wartime experience in the Second World War , to create this fine addition to fantastic sports fiction . <p> The thin rain against the windshield is so cold that Harry can see some of it freezing as it slides down the glass on this raw February morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Midwest winter in St. Louis . He wishes it were spring . <p> Harry is thinking about the war years . That 's where Edna 's head has been for the last several weeks , back in the 1940s , so it is natural that he reminisce about those days . Driving the new Buick to the nursing home , driving to see Edna , he thinks back to 1945 , which was , for Harry , routine terror , wave-top bombing runs , and then a rising cloud and the end of the war . <p> He was flight engineer on a Mitchell , a B-25 . They called her Stinky , for reasons he ca n't remember now , and she had the image of a local native chief painted on the side . It was okay to do stuff like that back then . They flew out of Okinawa , dropping bombs on the Japanese Home Islands . The 48th bomb squadron , 41st bomb group . Good bunch of guys . <p> On August 6 , ' 45 , they took off at 05:30 for a routine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles away from Hiroshima . They blamed that rule on the Navy , which always seemed to get the choice targets . <p> When they got into the combat zone , Harry left his seat in the back of the cockpit and climbed up into the top turret . He swiveled once , all the way around , to make sure it was running smooth on those tracks , and then fired one burst of the twin 50-calibers to clear them . <p> He was up in the turret , looking toward Japan , when the cloud started rising . Other guys , later , said they 'd seen a blinding white flash , but Stinky was too low , down under one thousand feet , for her crew to see any bright light over the horizon line . But that cloud , rising and rising and rising . What the hell was that ? Must have hit a hell of an ammunition dump , they figured . <p> Harry turns the corner onto Essex Avenue , and heads toward Kirkwood Haven , where they are doing their best for poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A little forgetfulness , some confusion . More . And then the steady slide into the gray haze . That bright , wonderful woman  --  gone . <p> He 's all cried out about it . Eventually , you adjust , you have to adjust and deal with it , get on with things , with your own life . Anal now , at least , she seems to be pretty stable , living in the past for the most part , a better past , really , than the one that really was . And , hell , Harry figures , she can live anytime she wants . He owes her that much , more , after all the stuff that went on back then , after the way he treated her . <p> Back then , she was home in San Antonio waiting for her war hero , hoping he 'd stay alive . They wanted to get married before he left , but her father had talked them out of it . Dad started regretting it the day Harry left town . Dad had fought , himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about it , knew what it could mean to have that love , that wife , waiting . All he could do was wait , and hope that Harry came through it all right , came back as the same guy who left . <p> Harry heard the story a hundred times . Edna was sitting on her favorite rocker , out under the pecan tree out in the back yard , when her father heard the news over the radio . <p> " Eddie ! Eddie ! " he said , yelling out the open kitchen window to her . " Come on in here , sweetie , and listen to this . We 've dropped some kind of new bomb on Japan ! " <p> And Eddie got up from the rocker so fast that she got dizzy , ran three steps , banged her head into that long bottom branch of the tree , and wound up flat on her back . <p> Her war wound , the family lore went , was worse than anything Harry got in thirty-seven missions . <p> Which was right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see the bomb . Or the pictures , later . Or have to think about it . On a city . Civilians . Children . Little children . <p> After every mission the guys went through debriefing and then got an inch of whisky in the bottom of their canteen cups . The ones smart enough to drink it went right to sleep , usually . Some guys were n't drinkers . Some guys thought about it all too much . The trick , Harry learned right away , was to not think about it , not think about those bombs and the people down there . <p> Harry shakes his head . That was such a long time ago . <p> He pulls into the parking lot of Kirkwood Haven , turns off the wipers , the lights , and opens the door to the cold , wet wind . Damn winter weather , he 's so tired of it . <p> Inside , in the front room , Edna is waiting for him , rocking , smiling . She remembers him today . <p> " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're finally here . Let 's get going . " <p> Get going ? Oh , Christ , what now , he wonders . <p> " I hope you brought your suntan lotion , Harry , you know how easily you burn , " she says , rising from the rocker and offering her hand , the motion a girlish reflection , coquettish . It 's been , god , fifty years , since he 's seen that little flick of the wrist , the offered hand , and it all comes back to him in a second . <p> He takes the hand . He will not , absolutely will not , cry , he thinks to himself . Damn . <p> " Suntan lotion , Eddie ? It 's February , dear , and gray , and cold . Let 's just sit here and talk , sweetie . " <p> " Oh , Harry , you have n't forgotten , have you ? " She smiles at him . " We said we 'd leave today , so we 'd have plenty of time to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can even celebrate Valentine 's Day there if we leave today . " <p> Pitchers and catchers and Valentine 's Day ? Suntan lotion ? <p> Oh , god . Harry thinks he knows what 's going on in her mind . Spring training , 1947 . St. Pete . The career that never was . <p> In 1939 , Harry Mack had the lowest ERA in the International League  --  2.12 . He won twenty-four games for the Redwings , seventeen more in Havana during winter ball . <p> Harry , at twenty years old , was on his way . <p> In the summer of 1946 , coming home , Harry , at twenty-seven , did n't have it . Oh , his arm strength was fine . He spent a few months pitching in a gym , and the ball felt good , moved a lot . But he did n't know if baseball made any sense to him anymore . <p> Still , he drove down to St. Petersburg with Edna in February of 1947 . Drove down in the brand new Buick her Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Got there in time for Valentine 's Day with his new bride . <p> Sam Breaden , the Cardinals owner , had offered him a try-out , just to do the right thing by a veteran , a guy who was promising before the war . But Harry realized , when he was there , that he did n't have it , knew he 'd have to find something else for life , and so , despite having made the drive , he never went onto the field for the tryout . He stood outside the field down there by the waterfront in St. Pete and watched the fellows loosen up while the pelicans dive-bombed the fish out in the harbor . <p> Bad enough , that bomb . But the next day , sitting in his tent , hung over from the celebrations the night before , Harry saw Death . <p> A Jap sapper , a guy who 'd been hiding in the jungle for six months , came in with a sword a mile long , slashing and stabbing . Jimmy Hedick got it in the gut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his head lopped off . He lived , gurgling , for the longest minute of Harry 's life , looking up at his flight engineer , eyes wide with terror and then nothing , that stare . <p> The Jap came up to Harry next . Looked at Harry . Sat down , cross-legged , took out another , shorter blade , and disemboweled himself . Harry was untouched , in most ways . <p> Two years later , standing there watching the guys get loose , even hearing the crack of the bat and the satisfying smack of the ball into leather , he just could n't see himself doing that anymore . That was his past , somehow , and now he was grown up . Others did okay , Musial was out there , and Slaughter , and Moore . Garagiola waved at Harry , told him to get his spikes on and get on out there . <p> But Harry could only shake his head . It just was n't there . He drove back to the hotel , handed Edna her Valentine 's Day card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pack , they were going home , back to Texas in the new Buick . Her Dad had a job lined up for him . A good job , at the dealership . <p> There were a lot of dreams ended by that damn war . A lot of them , millions . Harry 's was no big deal , he 'd gotten over it a long , long time ago . <p> And now this , with Edna . She 's all the way back there , remembering , living . Ready to go . <p> Still , no reason not to humor her a bit , poor Eddie . She 'd probably forget all about it in a few minutes anyway . <p> He walks over to the coat rack , grabs her favorite old wool overcoat . <p> " Sure , Eddie , I remembered , " he says . " Let 's go , honey . It 's a long drive . " <p> " Oh , well . I wondered , Harry . You know how you are , dear . So forgetful sometimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily , all that lost weight . She takes his hand and pulls him toward the front door of the place . " Oh , Harry , I 've been looking forward to this day for weeks . Come on , we can at least make it to Paducah by tonight , do n't you think ? " <p> " Sure , Edna , " he says . " Sure . Paducah . " <p> A quarter hour later , Edna is quiet as they drive through the residential streets toward Interstate 44 . Harry begins to think she 's forgotten the spring training thing already . Maybe , he figures , he 'll just take her to the Art Museum in Forest Park . She 'll like that . <p> He looks at her as they drive down Berry Road . So innocent , so sweet . This terrible thing that has happened to her has returned her to her childhood . <p> She notices his glance . <p> " You keep your eyes on the road , Harry Mack , and not on your bride , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you staring over at me instead of paying attention . " <p> She straightens herself up in the seat , looks out the front window . " I love this car , " she says . " I know you do n't like that Dad bought it for us , Harry . But it 's his dealership , so it did n't cost him anything , really , and he wanted so much to do something nice for us . " <p> Harry takes a breath . So it 's not over yet . He looks straight ahead down the road , says , " Well , you know I wanted us to get one on our own , Eddie , but god knows it would have been tough . And it is a great car . " <p> Playing along with her little fantasy , he adds , " The Post said it 's in the eighties today in St. Pete . " <p> " Does n't that sound wonderful , Harry ? The sun . After all this gray winter . Those beautiful beaches . And maybe we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Sure . Silver Springs . And Weeki-Watchee , and the Sunken Gardens . All of them , Eddie , all of them . " <p> " We can use the sunshine , Harry . I 'm tired of all this gray , " she says , and then falls silent . <p> He nods . He , too , is tired of all the gray . <p> Harry is n't sure why , but he decides not to get on the interstate , and instead drives on down Berry to Gravois , old Route 66 . He goes east on that , and figures by the time they cross the Mississippi and get into Illinois she 'll be over this thing and maybe they can get a bite to eat over there somewhere and then head home . <p> But Edna does n't get over it . Instead , they take the old Eads bridge across the river , ignore 1-64 , and get on Illinois Route 142 , the two-lane road over to Mt . Vernon . Somewhere on that road , maybe around Freeburg , Harry realizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as Edna is going to be like this he is going to play along . <p> It is , by any accounts , the happiest he 's seen her in years , decades maybe . All the pain , the bad times , moving from city to city with different jobs , losing little Tommy in that Asian war , the stupid things Harry 's done , the ways he 's hurt her , the cheating , the hard drinking , all of that , to her , has never happened , might never happen , is all up ahead in the future somewhere . <p> God , he wishes there were some way to reach her just long enough to get some forgiveness for it all . That 's what hurts the most , how she slipped away on him before he could really talk it out with her , admit what a monster he 'd been in so many ways over the years , tell her how sorry he was . If he had it to do over , things would be different , a lot better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the Shawneetown ferry across the river into Kentucky , where they pick up U.S. 41 . That road will take them all the way to St. Pete , and the sunshine . <p> Harry feels good in the Buick , likes the smell of it , the feel , the big steering wheel with " Buick Eight " written across it and the fancy Sonamatic radio and the jump seats in the back . Gauges everywhere , oil pressure and battery , the works . <p> It 's a hell of a car , painted sky blue , like they were flying , he and Edna , flying south out of the cold and rain and gray and finding Florida , some better past down there . <p> They decide to spend the night in Clarksville , at the old Clarksville Hotel . Harry knows the place was torn down in the late 1950s , but chooses not to worry about it as they check in . <p> Registering at the front desk , chatting with the bellboy and the elevator operator as they take their bags up the elevator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he just does n't even want to think about how it all has come to pass . <p> Truth is , he thinks , he even feels better physically . Stronger , younger . He takes a look in the bathroom mirror as they are getting settled in the room , and ca n't see much difference , but , god , he feels good . <p> Maybe it is Edna , rubbing off on him . She is as alive , as bright as he 's seen her in years . That , alone , makes this whole madcap thing worthwhile . Just seeing her like this is what makes him feel so much better . <p> They eat dinner in the hotel restaurant . Prime rib . The whole meal is under five dollars , including the glass of wine for Edna . Harry does n't drink anymore , of course , not since the big blowup twenty years ago - damn , he almost lost everything then , his job , Edna , the house . And all for the booze . But , like everything else , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't touched the stuff since . No reason she ca n't , though , especially under the circumstances . <p> After dinner they go for a walk to buy a few things . Harry also sees this as a chance to find out just how weird things are , to check his own sanity , in a way . <p> For the first few blocks he could swear they were back in the forties . They stop in one place and buy a nice little suitcase . It costs seven dollars . Another place sells them some underwear and socks , a few shirts , two dresses . It adds up to about twenty dollars all told . <p> There are ads everywhere for DeSotos and Frigidaire refrigerators and Maytag washing machines . The boys are home and business is booming . <p> Then , as they 're walking , Edna grips Harry 's hand , hard , and stumbles . <p> " Oh , Harry , " she says , and as he looks at her he sees in her eyes that Edna , his Edna , has fought through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Where are we ? " she says . And he 's about to tell her when she opens her purse and starts rummaging around in there . <p> A few feet away there 's a homeless guy sitting there , with a hand-lettered sign propped in front of him that reads " Homeless Vietnam vet . Please help me buy a meal . " <p> Harry ignores the guy . There are so many these days , and most of them are probably not vets at all , just in it for the easy money . Edna , though , fishes in her purse for some coins , and tosses the guy a handful of quarters . <p> He nods at the loud clink , says , " Thank you , ma'am . I forgive you . " <p> Harry almost has to pull Edna away before she gives him even more money , and when he finally gets her moving in the right direction the moment of clarity , that brief return to Now , is gone . <p> " With your contract money we can buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the signs . The war is over and the appliances are back , Harry thinks . And he can only shake his head . It 's 1947 . <p> They wind their way back to the hotel , and Edna greets the bellboy warmly , says hello to the desk clerk , strides happily toward the elevator . <p> An hour later , as they lie in the big bed together , on their backs , holding hands , Harry tries to figure out what 's going on , but there are n't any answers except that somehow she 's forcing herself back to a better past and him along with her . <p> As long as he stays with her , Harry decides , everything will be all right . He 'll take care of her , no matter how crazy it gets , until things get back to normal . Then he wonders if things will get back to normal . How long will this last ? It could end anytime . It could last forever . Or maybe , he thinks , in the morning it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna , in a voice he has n't heard in years , says , " Harry . Are n't you going to , you know ... ? " <p> He looks at her , smiles . <p> " Harry . I 'm so glad we 're together , " she says . " There were times I thought you 'd never make it home , and that scared me so . And now here you are , and we 're together . And the future looks so bright ! " She reaches over and hugs him , hard . <p> And they make love . Like the old , old days , they make love . After , Harry , exhausted , fails asleep with Edna in his arms . <p> In the morning , things are n't changed , it 's still the forties . And Harry has to admit to feeling comfortable with it all as he picks up the suitcase with their new clothes and places it into the deep trunk of the Buick . <p> They are on the road by seven , Harry driving through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , over the high pass at Monteagle , downshifting twice to get up the narrow , cliff-hugging road , and then waiting patiently behind a big semitrailer on the way down the other side . Edna is reading the Burma Shave signs out loud , and laughing at the best of them . <p> " Listen to this , Harry , " she says about one of them : " ' The chick/He wed/Let out a whoop/Felt his chin and/Flew the coop . ' Is n't that delightful ? " <p> And then , later , she recites another : " Spring has sprung/The grass has riz/Where last year's/Careless driver is . Burma Shave . " <p> She says that , then sits back in her seat with a smile . Spring , indeed , thinks Harry . A whole new season . <p> They stop for gas at a little gas station in South Pittsburg , waiting patiently for the attendant to clean the windshield and check the oil , and then , as they pull back on 41 , there is a hitchhiker there , a young guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tampa " on it . <p> Harry has n't picked up a hitchhiker in fifteen or twenty years , it has all gotten too dangerous for that . But Edna insists . <p> " He looks like a nice , clean-cut young man , Harry . And he 's cold there , standing out in the weather , " she says . <p> Harry , fully committed now to whatever folly she chooses , silently pulls the Buick over and waits for the guy to jog up to them , open the right-side door , and scramble in behind Edna . <p> " Wow , man . This is a great fucking car , " he says , settling in , and Harry cringes at the language , but Edna seems not to notice . " Where 'd you get it ? " the guy asks . " Jesus , it 's in great shape . " <p> " It ought to be , it 's brand new , " Edna says firmly . <p> " Yeah , " the guy says , smiling " Sure . Brand new . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says again , and then , leaning forward , he adds . " Thanks for the lift . I 'm heading down to Tampa to see my sister . " <p> " Well , you 're in luck , young man , " Edna says , turning to smile at him . " We 're on our way to St. Petersburg for spring training . My husband is a ballplayer , you know , and we 're driving right through Tampa on our way , are n't we Harry ? " <p> Poor Edna . Harry can only nod his head . <p> " You 're a ballplayer , huh ? " asks the kid , looking at Harry . Harry , watching the rear view mirror , can see the guy assessing him . <p> " Yeah , " the guy says . " You look like a ballplayer . Got the right build for it . Anyway , thanks for picking me up . ' Preciate it . " And he sits back , quiet for the moment . <p> Harry looks at his face in the mirror and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still the same old , overweight Harry Mack that he 's been for a long time now . The lines on his face , the gray hair ( but still a full head of hair , damn it ! , the too-large nose , swollen now from those past years of drinking  --  they are all the same , no matter how good he feels , no matter what the hitchhiker says , or Edna thinks . <p> Then , as he is about to look away , he thinks he sees , maybe there , in the background , hazy and indistinct , the faint image of another Harry , a younger one , smiling happy , the future ahead of him . <p> They stop for lunch in Calhoun , Georgia . The hitchhiker , to his credit , insists on paying for his own meal , and seems unfazed that his hamburger , fries , and Coke cost him a little under a dollar . <p> Later , as they work their way through Atlanta and then dive down into southern Georgia , Edna , who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and starts talking to the guy they 've picked up . <p> " Harry fought in the Pacific , " she says . " Flew those big bombers . We met in San Antonio where he was for training . " <p> " That 's nice , " the guy says , Harry listening to this with interest . What will the guy do when he figures out how crazy all this is ? <p> " I fought in the Pacific , too . A few years ago . In ' Nam . " <p> " ' Nam ? " <p> " Yeah . You know , Vietnam . Jesus , you know , the whole ' Nam thing . First Air Car . Nasty shit . " <p> Edna ignores the language . Later , she 'll tell Harry she knows that men pick up bad habits with their language when they 're in the Army . " You a pilot ? " he asks Harry . <p> " Flight engineer , " Harry says . " Flew out of Guam most of the time . Later , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some times we were glad to see you guys , " the guy says . " One time , in Quang Trai , you guys saved my butt completely , man . No shit . Completely . We were going to be overrun in another hour , but then you guys came over and that , man , was that . Jesus , what a show that was , some kind of fireworks , craters twenty yards across . " <p> Harry nods . " I hear it was tough over there , son , real tough . " He thinks about whether or not to mention the next thing then does . " We lost a boy over there , during Tet . A fine young man . " <p> Edna looks at Harry , puzzled . Then , for a few moments , it all clicks for her , she 's in the here and not in the past , just for those few moments , and she says , dreamily , " Yes . Our boy Tommy . Flew a helicopter . Our wonderful boy , Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go do his duty , like Harry had done his . The boy had actually been talking about Canada , imagine that . But Harry had convinced him otherwise . <p> Like old glass the whole world bleeds and shifts . The Buick , the scenery outside , it all starts to run , gets vague and unclear , like he 's in the new Olds and the old Buick at once , like they 're on 1-75 not old 41 , like it 's the Now and not the Then . <p> Then Edna brightens , forgets the sadness , adds , " Harry was flying over Japan the day they dropped the Bomb , is n't that so , Harry ? " <p> And the Buick is firm , the Then solidifies . Harry nods . <p> " Yeah . Saw it in the distance . Hell of a sight . " <p> " Oh , Harry . Please , " says Edna . <p> " Well , Eddie , it was a hell of a sight . " <p> " Yeah , " says the guy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sits back , quiet . <p> Harry and Edna call it a day in Valdosta , and the guy decides to keep hitching , in the darkness . There are best wishes all around and then , in the old Valdosta Inn , Harry and Edna eat a nice supper , go for a stroll through the Spanish moss-draped old oak trees that line Main Street , and then , back in their room , make love again . <p> The next morning , they 're in Florida by seven , and approaching St. Petersburg by early afternoon . They have n't said much for most of the day . Driving past Silver Springs , Edna mentions that she 'd like to come back up this way while they 're here , and Harry agrees . They do the same with Weeki-Watchee , and Tarpon Springs . <p> And then , after a light lunch at a roadside diner in Clearwater , they angle over to Gulf Boulevard and drive down the coast . <p> On their right , the Gulf sparkles in the warm breeze . There are little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rocks they see a " For Rent " sign in front of a little group of four or five places like that . <p> They pull into the sandy parking lot , and the rate is forty dollars a week . <p> The place is a tidy little one-bedroom home , with a nice kitchen , a little living room , a screened-in front porch with the damnedest view in the world of the Gulf and the pelicans . The sunsets are going to be great . <p> It 's only three o'clock by then , but Harry 's tired and says he wants to rest . <p> " I wo n't hear of it , Harry Mack , " Edna says . " You 've been talking about this for months . Let 's get right over there and see what Mr. Breaden has in mind for you . " <p> And so they climb back into the Buick and drive over to Al Lang . <p> Harry is terrified . Where will this end ? <p> But there they are , in the old parking lot on First Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't out there , loosening up . There 's Stan , and Enos , and Joe . Garagiola waves at him , yells at him to get those spikes on and get warmed up . <p> And there , leaning on the wooden fence , is Sam Breaden . Edna gets out of the Buick , waves and shouts at him , " Mr. Breaden ! Mr. Breaden ! " <p> And damned if Breaden does n't wave back , shout out her name , and come over to chat with them . <p> Harry climbs out , too . <p> " Hello , Mr. Breaden , " he says . <p> " Harry . Glad to have you here , boy . And a couple of days early , too . Well , no problem . Let 's get you in and get you some equipment . Feel like loosening up a bit today , just to get a feel for things ? Then , tonight , let me take you and your beautiful wife out to dinner . That sound all right ? " <p> Harry laughs . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've heard good things about you , son . Ted Williams said he hit against you in a game over on Guam or somewhere , and you struck the son-of-a-gun out . We can use someone who can get hitters as good as that Williams kid out , I 'll tell you that . <p> " C'm on , son . As long as you 're here , let 's get you started , " Breaden says , and steers him by the elbow . <p> Harry smiles and waves at Edna as he and Breaden walk over to the clubhouse door . Edna takes a seat in the rickety old bleachers that sit behind the batting screen . <p> She 's relaxing maybe fifteen minutes later when Harry walks out . He 's got the flannels on , and some new spikes , a good Wilson glove , that Cardinal cap . It 's her Harry , her major leaguer . <p> He walks over to her . <p> " I 'm really here , Edna . It 's me . I 'm really here . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Inside the clubhouse he stood in front of the mirror and saw himself at twenty-seven . Lithe . Strong . Behind that image , faint and ghostly , was the real Harry , old , tired , worn down by bad decisions , a few wrong turns . <p> But now , here , god he feels good . <p> " Of course you 're here , Harry , " Edna says . " We 're both here . " And then , as he starts to turn to jog toward the bullpen where he 'll loosen up , she adds , " I forgive you , Harry . " <p> And he turns back to look at her , his beautiful young bride sitting there , and shakes his head . Forgiveness . Maybe that 's what this is all about . And second chances . For Harry , for Edna . <p> Will it last past today ? Tomorrow is Valentine 's Day , will they still be here , in this better past , starting over ? He does n't know , but then he thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's here . He 's here . Now . <p> He starts to cry , he loves her so . It will be better this time . " Oh , Edna , " he says , " Oh , Eddie , thank you , thank you so much . " <p> " Go now , you big lug , " she says , wiping his eyes with her handkerchief . <p> And he does , out to the bullpen , where Garagiola waits to warm him up . <p> <p> By Rick Wilber <p>
