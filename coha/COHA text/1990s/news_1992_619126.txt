<p> While most American industries are gripped by recession , the $ 1 billion a year politics business is booming , and professional consultants increasingly dominate candidates and campaigns . <p> Aided by the decline of political parties , the advent of computer-age technology and the explosion of spending in modern campaigns , consultants have revolutionized American politics in a single generation . Contributors and the media now often judge candidates ' viability as much by their team of strategists as by the quality of their ideas . <p> Unseen by the public and largely unencumbered by government regulation , top consultants command large fees and huge commissions , working long hours under incredible pressure to put politicians in office  --  and then managing them once they are in office . <p> " Consultants have transformed political campaigning from mom-and-pop , storefront operations to high-tech endeavors , " said Larry Sabato , a University of Virginia political scientist . " Not only is the business not shrinking , it 's expanding each passing year , as candidates engage in a never-ending struggle to one-up their opponents . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lawyers , the several thousand political insiders who hang out shingles as political consultants practice an array of specialities . They also have their own professional group , the American Association of Political Consultants , which opens its winter meeting in San Francisco today . <p> Nowhere has the politics business flourished more than in California , the state that spawned the industry and is 1992 's most lucrative market . On the state 's ballot this year will be two U.S. Senate races , seven new House seats , and dozens of congressional and legislative districts made competitive by reapportionment . <p> " In California , we have this culture of consultants , " said Clint Reilly , a San Francisco-based operative whose multimillion dollar earnings symbolize the profession 's fast-track success . " My passion has been to develop a profession called political consulting , not to elect candidates . " A SHORT HISTORY <p> Consulting as a profession is a relatively new phenomenon , but the business dates to the mid-1930s , when the late public relations man Clem Whitaker Sr. and his wife , Leone Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that included passage of the Central Valley water project . <p> In the 1960s , Southern California consultants Stu Spencer and Bill Roberts vaulted into national prominence when they shaped Ronald Reagan 's candidacy for governor and pioneered use of computers to classify voters . <p> But Spencer and Roberts were an exception for their time . <p> " There were n't really political consultants in the late 60s and early 70s , " said Richie Ross , a Sacramento consultant who most recently ran former Mayor Art Agnos ' unsuccessful campaign . " The campaign manager was a staff guy or the candidate 's friend . " <p> But as computer technology grew , so did the ability of consultants to divide the electorate into increasingly precise subgroups that could be targeted for specialized messages . Beginning with the 1960 presidential campaign , television became an increasingly important tool for candidates and allowed them to run as personalities , rather than vessels of ideology . <p> In the early 1980s , when San Francisco entrepreneur Reilly began demanding  --  and receiving  --  six-figure fees , consulting took off as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else drove the bigger fees , " said Sacramento consultant David Townsend . " The money expanded , making it possible for people to go into the business . " <p> As special interests began pouring unprecedented amounts of money into campaigns , candidates increasingly used it to pay for squads of political specialists . <p> " The way we sell cereal was brought to politics , and there 's no question that it has become a lucrative business , " said Steve Merksamer , a Sacramento attorney specializing in political law . " This kind of talent is expensive . " <p> WHAT CONSULTANTS DO <p> Despite their high-priced reputation , consultants say portrayals of them as rip-off artists miss the mark . <p> " I 'm not overcharging , and I 'm not gouging , " said Gale Kaufman , a Sacramento consultant who specializes in legislative races . <p> " It 's a 24-hour a day job , " she added . " You have to be a psychologist , a social worker , understand real people 's problems , have press skills , be a coach who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , know how to read a poll , develop TV and radio ads and avoid getting hustled by vendors . " <p> For general consultants , the economics of running a campaign , according to Kaufman and others , involve fees and commissions . <p> To cover time and overhead , consultants typically charge a fee , which may vary from $ 25,000 or less to more than $ 100,000 , or a retainer of $ 3,000 or $ 5,000 a month for longtime clients . Candidates also pay consultants ' travel and other expenses and for items such as polls , at a cost of $ 15,000 or more . <p> Consultants make profits by 15 percent commissions on materials they produce for the campaign  --  the design and production of mail , for example , or the costs of making TV ads and buying air time . <p> More specialized consultants work on a fee-for-service basis . <p> The list of political sub-contractors that come under the heading of " consultant " is long : attorneys specializing in political law , computer list vendors , direct mail designers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers , media strategists , petition circulators , telephone bank operators , pollsters , sign makers and voter registration organizers , among others . <p> One recently expanding market niche has been carved out by consultants who do " opposition research , " finding and analyzing political counter-intelligence . <p> The most successful opposition researchers do their investigating not by digging through trash , but through computer searches of electronic data banks . <p> " I know I 've done my job when I know more about the candidate than they ( the opponents ) do , " said Joe Rodota , a Sacramento consultant who played a crucial behind- the-scenes role in Governor Wilson 's 1990 win over Dianne Feinstein . The mild-mannered Rodota was jokingly known as " Doctor Death " among Wilson insiders . <p> ETHICAL DILEMMA <p> At a time when public participation in the political process is declining , some experts argue that the slick nature of the candidates ' packaging by consultants has undermined public confidence . <p> " In California , we 've seen a substitution of this scientific expertise for grass-roots politics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of California at Berkeley . " The decline in grass- roots politics may be related to people 's feelings of cynicism and alienation . In a sense , people feel manipulated by consultants . " <p> Although campaigns are often governed by contribution and reporting requirements , there is virtually no regulation of consultants ' activities . Attempts to regulate them have prompted complaints that such rules would violate constitutional protections . <p> According to the Code of Professional Ethics for the American Association of Political Consultants , members should " refrain from false and misleading attacks on an opponent or member of his family " and avoid seven other practices , including any " appeal to voters which is based on racism or discrimination . " <p> There is little the association can do , however , if members of the organization violate the code , acknowledged association president Bill Hamilton . <p> " We do not have police power or penalty power , " Hamilton said . " Right now , the only penalty is the marketplace . "
