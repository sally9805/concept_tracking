Martin Short first tumbles onstage dressed in a white Little Lord Fauntleroy suit and looking like the sort of kid Spanky used to make fun of in the old Our Gang comedies . He 's playing Noble Eggleston , a pampered rich boy so accomplished he goes to both Harvard and Yale . Short moves on to impersonate an assortment of characters , from a wheezing old millionaire to a dictatorial German film director . He sings ; he dances ; he makes costume changes so fast even David Copperfield would be envious . Is this the hardest-working man in show business ? Little Me was created in 1962 as a vehicle for Sid Caesar , who played seven different roles . For the new Broadway revival , Short plays eight . <P> It 's a daft , inspired , yet miraculously unhammy star turn . Short does n't merely show off his versatility ( how about that German accent , folks ! ) ; he creates a string of finely crafted caricatures . Truth be told , the Neil Simon-Cy Coleman-Carolyn Leigh musical has n't aged all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a fictional grande dame of the stage and screen , it 's too sketchy and weightless , with a rather severe dramatic flaw : the central character ( played by the full-voiced , full-figured Faith Prince ) is constantly upstaged by her multi-role-playing co-star . <P> But the show has some funny , scattershot gag writing reminiscent of Caesar 's Your Show of Shows , on which Simon once worked ( " But , Mother ... " " Do n't ' But , Mother ' me . " " But , Father ... " ) . Director-choreographer Rob Marshall moves the pieces briskly in everything from the perky Rich Kids Rag number to a chain-gang soft shoe . Most of all , there 's Short , who gives the kind of knockout Broadway performance that delights us even more because it 's delivered by an interloper from Hollywood . <P> Lots of his sort have been interloping lately . Jennifer Jason Leigh is playing Sally Bowles in the acclaimed Broadway revival of Cabaret . Nicole Kidman is about to take the town by storm in David Hare 's The Blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are among the other film and recording stars currently giving Broadway a whirl . <P> Why do they come ? On the stage they make less money , have to work harder and risk getting creamed by the critics in a rare sector of show biz where critics can still matter . A Short answer : " The theater , " he says , " is the ultimate reconfirmation of why you even started out to be an actor . " The Canadian-born comic began his career on the Toronto stage , appearing in shows like Godspell ( with Gilda Radner ) and You 're a Good Man , Charlie Brown before moving to the U.S. , where he became a chameleonlike star on SCTV and Saturday Night Live . He 's had a respectable movie career as well , but his occasional stage work  --  notably in the underrated 1993 musical The Goodbye Girl  --  showed off the kind of effortless song-and-dance talent that in another era would have made him a huge Broadway star . " I know very few actors who started off saying ' I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be a television star , ' " says Short . " There 's something about going back to the actual reason that you want to be an actor that is awfully good for the soul . "
