There are triple-digit monsters lurking out there-and new ways to fight them , if you dare // They 're beady-eyed , potgutted and huge-mouthed , with lips like Goodyear 's multi-ply best . Their scaleless bodies and groping sensory barbels lend a straggly Ming the Merciless look to a countenance that by most standards is already plug-ugly . Their spined pectoral and dorsal fins can pierce a boot-and the foot inside . And to top it off , they come in Jabba the Hutt dimensions . Catfish are indeed monstrous . That is undoubtedly part of their appeal . ( Government surveys rank catfish as the nation 's third most popular gamefish . Fifteen million anglers pursue them every year . It 's catfish compulsion . And it starts early in life . Along with panfish , cats are a good bet to have formed most kids ' earliest fishing experiences . They 're accessible almost anywhere . They can be caught with anything from.unadorned live bait to scentbaits concocted according to carefully guarded recipes and with enough ingredients to give a forensic chemist a fivealarm migraine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be found on trips that do n't require a second mortgage . The cat is Everyman 's fish ... and it does n't hurt that a catfish can be the backbone of a tolerably fine meal . What turns casual catfishing into compulsion , though , is the urge to do battle with tackle-busting behemoths , a desire fed bv rich-and occasionally real-tales of epic confrontations . Take the story of " McGill , " a short , slightly built Mexican who landed a job at a hatchery owned by Great Lakes , Inc. , a private lake management firm in Nest Columbia , Tex . ( Catfish " farming " is very big business , with many food processors and fast-food chains anxious for fresh product . ) McGill 's unenviable task was to fetch the eggs from submerged prefab " rests " made from cutout 55gallon drums , guarded by 80- to 150-pound male blue cats . The big blues lay with their tails and bodies in the drums , heads hanging out like moray eels on anabolic steroids . On his first day , McGill held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brutes for eggs . Twice the big cats grabbed his probing arm and shook him like a dog trying to crack a possum 's spine . That was bad enough , but on the second day a 100-pound-plus blue actually charged from its lair , grabbed McGill at the waist , shot to the surface like a Polaris missile and pushed him , flailing all the way , across the lake . Terrified , McGill screamed the only appropriate English he could remember : " Godzilla , Godzilla , Godzilla ! " Finally free of the jaws , he staggered ashore , found manager Mike Wood and said , " I am sorry . That 's the third time they have grabbed me . I have quit . " Whomping great cats-blues , flatheads , channels-swim in U.S. waters . Even bigger ones live elsewhere . Take the wels ( wallower ) catfish , initially from Russia but now found in most of Europe . Reliable reports of recent catches range from 200 to 400 pounds - and a Russian fish of 16 feet and 660 pounds has been claimed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have drowned at least one young angler who foolishly tied his fishing line to his wrist . As you might predict , the wels has a band of fanatic angling devotees . In the Amazon River system there is the lau-lau or piraiba , a cat that grows larger than anyone really knows . Reports from jungle river travelers tell of six-foot-long fillets drying in the sun . These cats are incredibly powerful . Ten-foot piraibas weighing more than 250 pounds have been caught ; the " large " ones have always escaped . Catfish compulsion can strike almost anyone . No less a legend than John J. Audubon was a catman , favoring blues and flatheads . Audubon was a trotliner , to boot . Another catman 's obsession took a bizarre twist that I ca n't confirm but heard from a reliable source : Suffering from a chronic heart problem , the angler underwent valve-replacement surgery , convincing his doctor to save the faulty diskshaped valve once it had been removed . Upon recovery , the angler was quickly back on his favorite river , where he baited his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a catfish . Let 's just say a catman 's dedication is complete . If you choose to enter this realm of the gigantic and grotesque , come prepared . Rods : Boat rods for big fish should be seven to eight feet . Many saltwater rods are ideal . For river fishing , the hottest new setup is a verT long rod such as Cabela 's I1-foot European Predator . Long rods let you steer baits and floats , prevent drifting rigs from moving too fast and mend and keep line from dragging in the current . The shortest rod you should even consider is a seven-foot bass flipping rod . Reels : Revolving spool reels with click controls are the first choice . If you 're hung up on fixed spool ( spinning ) reels , get over it . But if you ca n't , look into one of Shimano 's Baitrunners , which allow you to fish with the bail closed . ( Fish take out line against little resistance ; a flip of a lever puts the preset drag into action . ) Lines : Pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15-pound-test . The new fused lines should be high on your list . Hooks : Depending on bait size and the size of the cat you hope will take it , hooks should range from 1/0 to 6/0 . For small cats , Nos. 4 and 6 are good . Basic beak hooks without frills are fine , but many experts have been switching to turning-type hooks like the Tru-Turn . Some anglers swear by Kahle models . In snag-free areas consider 7B or QuickStrike hooks . Baits : A whole mystique has grown up around catfish stinkbaits . An old-time catman may share his favorite fishing hole with you , but do n't expect him to share his bait secrets . However , live baitfish-or fresh , oily forage fish in chunks or strips-are overall more effective than the man-made potions . This is especially true when fishing for flatheads , which are even more partial to fresh dead baits or live baits than blue or channel cats . Still-water Technique : Catfish do not always feed smack on the bottom . Baits suspended slightly above bottom are frequently superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface , feasting on forage fish , just like bass or stripers . Late summer and fall are the best times , and spoons and crankbaits are supremely effective then . When threadfin shad die in cold water and flutter to the bottom , or when they are healthy and simply hanging in schools , cats often suspend right below them . Ihey 'll catch and eat dying shad or make forays into schooled forage . Use a vertical jigging spoon or hang a live bait after scoping the situation on your sonar . // Bottom rig : A surf fisherman 's " fish finder " on the main line allows baits to be taken without the cat feeling any weight . // River Technique : While still-water fishing remains popular , current fishing for cats is exploding . River fishermen need to become skilled at predicting where fish will hold based on time of year , time of day and water conditions . For example , in low-light periods , feeding cats often move to riffles ahead of deeper holes ( see illustration ) . The heads of holes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the deep centers of the holes are where the largest fish hold . In low water and bright conditions , also look for cover in the form of trees , rock or man-made debris protruding into the hole . The dominant fish-usually the largest as well-command the best spots at the heart of the snags . To determine exactly where the fish are holding when absent , search with a drifting float rig with your bait fairly near the bottom . Do n't get sloppy by allowing the float to move down ahead of the bait ; this will pull the bait higher in the water column and also bow your line and cause hook sets to fail . Instead , " feel " the rig downstream , checking the float 's progress often to keep the bait ahead of the float . Bottom Rigs : Catmen have discovered the " fish-finder rig , " which was orginally used by saltwater surfcasters . The key is a plastic sleeve , threaded on the main line , that has a snap to hold the sinker . The reel is kept in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line slides freely through the sleeve , so the fish can swim off but will feel virtually no weight tugging on the bait . As a bonus , in heavy current , this rig also allows the bait to be floated a varying distance from the bottom . Alternatively , use a running leger rig . This is a European variation of a classic split shot/dropper steelhead rig . The key is in the split shot pinched on a doubled length of heavy monofilament , called the link . A loop is left in this monofilament link at the point where it is doubled over . Your leader slides through this loop . If the split shot are arranged tight against each other , the rig tends to move along through the drift-which is what you want . In heavier flow , spread the shot apart . This causes the rig to catch and hold bottom better , slowing the drift ( or hold the rig stationary in slow current ) . If the shot snag they will usually pull right off their mono loop . Use soft , round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisting and encourage snags . Noodling : Noodling is traditional among certain fishermen-generally those who consider themselves immortal . The noodler sloshes or swims along the bank , ducking under and groping into holes until he feels a catfish and grabs it . However , if the fish is big and it grabs the noodler instead , he 's going to stay right there . That 's why noodlers with any sense use helpers to hold the tag end of a rope tied around the noodler 's waist . Many noodlers are missing some fingers because large snapping turtles utilize the under-bank holes , too . I 'm not sure why anyone would want to be a noodler . Catfish compulsion with rod-and-reel is plenty for me. // Active catfish will hold behind riffles or at the head of holes . But the biggest fish favor the deepest holes , especially if cover-such as a blowdown-offers shade and protection . // <p>
