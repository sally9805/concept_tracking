For a moment all merged in brilliant colors as the landing party filed shoreward along the jetty , the goose-stepping joker in blue-black and salmon , topped by cockscomb and bells , at the head of the line . He was trailed by minstrels , the witless king of discord in his chamber-pot crown , blessing his subjects with pale awkward gestures , and beauties in costume waving to the crowd while a tribe of jugglers tossed wooden pins into the air . Hunt and his father watched them prance up the line . Then the dwarf in his dogcart was suddenly there , bringing up the rear and staring at Hunt with kohl-rimmed eyes that commanded , held him fixed on the spot , unable to avert his gaze-the little man in his cart so different from Hunt 's father , who was tall , relaxed , and casually dressed with an open-collared shirt beneath his gabardine jacket . <p> The revelers had no sooner passed through the gates of the amusement park than Hunt heard a distant wailing come down from the high end of Schatzel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral march being played by a brass band . He looked to his father for an explanation as the sound drew nearer , growing louder , but F. J. Crofford shook his head and said , " Wait , give it a chance . " <p> So they waited near the seawall until a troupe of mock bishops and weird acolytes appeared at the head of a cortege coming slowly down from the upper limits of the city . It crossed Water Street and seemed to hang there at the intersection for a moment without moving . Traffic was backed up on Shoreline to let the pallbearers pass . Almost as one they took a halting step forward before coming to rest again in the middle of the pavement , and Hunt saw that the pallbearers carried a huge board-and-timber sardine instead of a coffin . Someone with patience and skill had worked to make a large replica of the small fish . Behind the sardine came hundreds of widows in mourning and black veils , weeping and wailing , their garments fluttering in the breeze that came off the bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the glare of lights Hunt was sure , almost sure , that he saw blue-shadowed jaws , heavy makeup , and masculine cheeks uncovered as a veil lifted in the breeze and fell back into place . The procession moved one step at a time until it was abreast of the boy and his father , moving so slowly Hunt could see the widows were not women at all , but men cloaked in black dresses . Hundreds of them weeping and sweating , their makeup streaked and roughened by the growth of a day 's stubble . <p> Father and son joined the rear of the column when it came up , tagging along as the cortege went forward to the bay with the band playing off-key . Hunt heard the bell toll in the cathedral tower up on the bluff-seven o'clock . The hour surprised him . He had not noticed the time slipping by . At the foot of Resaca the bishop began the funeral , chanting prayers , bowing , and blessing the sardine with raised extended fingers . He conducted the service solemnly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd . What happened next made Hunt stare in wonder at the mock bishop and the sardine . In a single gesture the man in robes ignited the fish . Flames leaped from the wooden figure , and the bishop launched it on the water , where a backwash carried it away from shore , spewing and flaming like green pine , sending up sparks . It burned furiously out on the water , a funeral pyre bobbing in a circle of light , watched by the crowd of widows and mourners . They had fallen silent by then and were staring at the burning spectacle before them as if in a trance . <p> When the end came it did so with a crack and a sudden collapse , the sardine falling in on itself like coals in a fireplace . For a moment there was a rush of sparks flying up that filled the air . After that the last of the flames began to die away , every minute growing dimmer and smaller until gone , leaving only the charred remains of the fish on its wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripple passed through the crowd from end to end . It ran through the people along the seawall , and all was still again . Hunt would remember that later the brief stillness that lay upon the water and the boats floating nearby , the waiting faces in the crowd , the unexpected silence . <p> At that instant a flare shot up and the horns broke into a jazzy rendition of " When the Saints Go Marching In . " It soared over the bay in a great arc , reached its highest point , and broke with a boom into cascades of molten gold that filled the black sky with light . Falling , it showered dying embers on the harbor and disappeared as bursts exploded overhead , spherical patterns , clusters of fuchsia , concentric bands and crystalline forms of pulsing pale green arching over the horizon beyond a lavender veil . And above it all , a corona of gold . Hunt lifted his eyes to the sky and gazed in awe at the light show bursting above . <p> All of this in honor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For longer than the boy could remember the city had celebrated the event each year with floats on parade , a symbolic barge landing , and fireworks . Crofford had told his son about Alonso Alvarez de Pineda 's meeting with Carancahua warriors under the salt cedars that grew down to the surf . There had been a feast of smoked shellfish on that first day , provisioned by the Indians , who were taller than the Spaniards , naked , smeared with skunk oil and mud to ward off mosquitoes , which tormented Pineda 's men until a breeze came up from the sea and drove the pests inland to the cover of reed beds and brackish pools along the Nueces . That was in 1519 , centuries before the city came into existence . <p> Year after year , for as long as Hunt could remember , his father brought home accounts of spectacular floats , stiltwalkers in silk top hats , jugglers , and clowns . Crofford promised that one day when he was old enough the boy would see it all for himself-the barge making its landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came they would follow the others into the amusement park , where his father operated the merry-go-round with Sam Graggs . His mother had resisted his going . Soon enough , she said . But the promise remained-a covenant between them , his father and him . Each spring , as talk of the festival grew , the boy would wait for the time when his father would deem him grown up enough to go out among the people celebrating the arrival of Pineda and the Spanish . In Hunt 's eyes it was the season to steel himself against disappointment , but at last the time had finally come . Father and son went with the crowd through the arched gateway and down the length of the midway . <p> II <p> A spotlight picked out a barker standing on a patch of sunbleached shell in front of a tent and touting the marvels within , a two-headed calf , the creature from the dark lagoon , a monster seen only in nightmares . Lavender hues , bursts of yellow , neon blues lit up arcades and booths on each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the blare of calliope music and garish colors coming together in his head . Later he would remember the young woman , Cosima Lara , stopping to speak to his father , asking if Hunt was enjoying himself-something like that - and laying a finger on Crofford 's wrist . She had played a pastry maker 's widow out on the barge , a witness in the trial of her persecutor , a small part in the skit . It was a night of people acting like widows , the boy supposed , men dressed in women 's clothing and such . <p> " You saw the mourners ? " Miss Lara asked . <p> " Some needed a shave . " <p> " The boy has an eye for details , " Crofford put in . <p> " Really ? " There was an air of gaiety in her question . " Gets that from his father , does he ? " <p> But Crofford hardly noticed , it seemed , because he was already telling her that Hunt was exhausted , too much in one day . The boy missed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . A man with a camera handed his father a card . <p> " I 'd like a print of that , " Miss Lara said . <p> " Is n't it time for the bathing-suit review , Cosima ? " Hunt was aware something was going on . He could n't name what it was , but there was a tone to the words . When the boy came out of that reverie F. J. was glancing at his watch and saying , " You do n't want to be late . " <p> " You 're coming ? " she asked . " The two of you ? " <p> His father looked at him . " What do you say , sport ? Got enough left for one last show ? " And as Hunt nodded F. J. sent her along with a promise . " We 'll be there . " <p> Hunt watched her hurry toward the bathhouse at the edge of the amusement park , just above the beach and the salt cedars . He remembered the first time his father let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , remembered later rinsing off in the bathhouse . There had been other children at the beach , younger than he was and in the water , splashing , riding their floats . He had stood on the beach , wanting to go in , but his mother was protective . She would n't allow it until finally his father insisted . He remembered afterward the shower beating against his upturned face , washing the salt and sand from him . A day to remember . <p> The crowd swept them toward the boardwalk . All around , people were saying it was time , time for the bathing beauties to pass in review . Hunt could smell the cypress boards , damp with sea spray and the night air , as he and his father were pressed from behind right up to the walk , heads turned , waiting for the beauty contestants to come from the bathhouse in their swimsuits . But it was the slackjawed king of discord who came out , grinning and pushing up the wash basin , which kept slipping down over his eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leroy Simkin , bring out the girls . " <p> This brought him to a halt on the boards , where he stared at the crowd , confused , turned his head toward the bathhouse , then scurried back inside while some of the people hooted and called for the girls . <p> Palm fronds and tamarisks quivered in the light that just reached the shore . You could see lines of white rollers advancing , hear them splash as they broke on the beach because a breeze off the bay carried the sound toward the crowd , which cheered when the first young woman appeared in the doorway and strode down the boardwalk , looking athletic in a silver one-piece . It was Cosima Lara , her bare arms swinging in stride . Behind her came a young woman who had played the role of a religious sister in the barge production out on the bay . The other five followed the first two in single file , arms swinging in unison . They had a bounce to their walk as they came along in their slingbacks , evenly spaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned , and came back like professional models , paused , struck poses , faced front and rear , smiling at those nearest them . But Simkin was back again and now loping down the line , grinning , staring at the faces in the crowd . <p> " Here comes Leroy , " a man yelled . " Watch him , ladies , or he 'll step on your toes . " <p> It was an awkward moment . Hunt could see what the man was talking about when he glanced at the open-toed slingbacks they were wearing . Miss Lara had reached the boy and his father and was moving forward for Leroy to pass behind her on his way to the end of the line . Hunt dropped his eyes , not wanting to meet Leroy 's demented gaze . At the same time he was aware of Cosima almost upon him , but the crush from behind held him fast . It left him staring at the arch of her instep and the leather strap looped round her heel . <p> " Are you asleep ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " F. J. answered for him . " Too much for one day . " <p> " Then take him home , " she said . " Do n't you see he ca n't keep his eyes open ? " <p> Hunt glanced up and saw she was smiling , her eyes friendly , and the line started moving again back toward the bathhouse , their bare arms swinging to the clack of their heels on the boards . And then it was over . <p> Hunt and F. J. crossed to the water 's edge and moved up the beach . From the west came the sound of a switch engine shunting cars to a siding , a train being assembled for the long night haul to the border . The noise made him glance that way , and he noticed the silent sight of a slow freight train going by , a single yard light strobing on each boxcar as it passed . They walked past Gussett 's Wharf and the Puerto Pesquero , approached Lloyd 's Pavilion , alive with dance music drifting shoreward , like mist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a straight line above the struts of the Pavilion Pier and went all the way out to the end , where a full moon had broken through the clouds , backlighting their billowy fringe . Below on the water , a ragged smear of moonlight came toward the shore right up to the beach . Then they were past the reflected lights of Lloyd 's Pavilion , past the Breakers Hotel , and the boy listened for the long , lonesome whistle of the train going across the viaduct . It would be in a distant city by daybreak . <p> III <p> Everything looked different in the light of day . The water was green close to shore-cool , shallow , the rollers breaking in a white froth-blue farther out . It was low tide and the edge of the sea scraped at the beach . Waves washed against Gussett 's Wharf . Epworth 's Camp was alive with children . Boys his age and older ran shouting , splashing , grappling under the watchful eyes of adults . Girls in bathing caps remained apart from the rough play . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buoys . A shout warned them back . There were camp rules . Hunt passed the Puerto Pesquero . He would return when the boats came in to watch them unload . The long stretch of firm wet sand ran all the way to the salt cedars , where he would enter the water , but first he was obliged to let his father know . There were rules for him too . <p> F. J. had a panel off the merry-go-round and was under the floor boards , his arms up in the sprockets and ball joints , bolting a rod into place . Hunt could see shafts radiating from the center and the flywheel that regulated everything . If you looked at the workings and forgot the painted horses you could see the carousel was actually a great wheel with moveable spokes . <p> Sam Graggs came up with two smoking coffees in paper cups . " You 're out early , hotshot . " <p> Crofford dropped his arms , shoved his wrench to the side , and looked out . " When did you two get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , handing one of the paper cups to F. J. , who pulled himself out and braced his back against the skirt of the carousel . " Find the problem ? " <p> " Housing on the ball joint cracked , with bits of metal gumming the works . Each time it tried to lift , the cam hung up until the pressure reached a certain point . Then it jerked forward , causing Sea Biscuit to buck . I replaced everything and packed the casing with grease . Ought to ride smooth now . " <p> " Let 's hope so . " Graggs sipped his coffee . " Careful , that 's hot . " <p> F. J. looked at Hunt . " Out for a swim ? " <p> The boy nodded . <p> Sam gazed toward the horizon . " Great day for bathing . " <p> The boy 's father blew on his coffee . " Go ahead , sport . " <p> " Just a minute . " Sam Graggs took a nickel from his pocket and gave it to Hunt . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Thank you . " He glanced at his father to make sure it was all right . <p> Crofford nodded . " Off with you now . " <p> The boy changed in the bathhouse and passed through the grove of salt cedars , where he dropped his towel and looked at the sun-dappled water . A platform floated well out in the bay , and bathers were sunning on it or using it to dive to the sandy bottom . A second line of waves broke on the shoals halfway between the pontoon and the shore . He saw porpoises playing in the ship channel beyond the diving raft and hurried past the concession booth to the water , plunging headfirst into the waves . The breakers tumbled him in the wild wash of foam . The next wave lifted and rolled beneath him , letting him slip down the backside into the trough , where the water was deep enough to tread . <p> On the beach two young women left the clump of tamarisks and stopped at the booth for inflated rafts , which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one of the swimsuit contestants . They came laughing and splashing through the surf . Sea spume swirled round their legs , frothing and falling back . It broke over their hips , washing round them , but they came on , putting their floats ahead of them into the water , mounting , paddling forward . Cosima had pulled her hair back and tied it . And then he saw that she recognized him as they drew near . <p> " Look who 's here . You 're up early for someone who was so exhausted last night . Where 's your father ? " <p> Hunt lifted his chin toward the merry-go-round . " Working on Sea Biscuit . " <p> Miss Lara was grinning , glancing sideways at her friend . " Some mechanic , that father of yours . Did he show you the works last night ? " <p> He thought about that , vaguely aware she was telling her friend to go on . She would catch up . He did n't think he had ever wanted anything as much as he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much he did n't understand , much that was unpleasant , confusing . He wanted to trust what he saw , but things were n't always what they seemed . He knew that now because he had seen what he thought were women in mourning . In his mind that smacked somehow of betrayal and treachery . He had seen other things too , all in a frenzy . It was a frenzy he would try to sort out , for there had been kindness , as well . <p> " Why were they dressed that way ? " <p> " So it 's answers you want ? " She paddled against the current that was pushing her float toward shore . Hunt saw again her quick , happy smile . " It 's just an annual tradition , dressing like widows and mourning a big wooden symbol . Nothing else . " <p> " A tradition from when the city was founded ? " <p> " Earlier than that . This one came out of Spain in the Middle Ages-or before . " <p> The Middle Ages meant nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he was born , which he could never do . You had to trust what grown people told you because they knew things you might never understand . He paid attention , but he could n't always make sense of adult behavior . " People acted that way ? How do you know ? How can anyone know ? " <p> She bobbed on her raft and stared at him . The mirth had gone out of her face . " Think about it . You see a painting dated a hundred years ago . We know the painter actually lived because someone wrote him a letter that survived or we have a letter he wrote to a friend . In that painting he 's depicted the same images you saw last night . That tells you something , does n't it ? " <p> Wanting to ask if there really was such a picture he said , " Yes . " And left it at that . <p> She turned on her float , gazing over her shoulder . Hunt could see his father take hold of a crank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply when his arm went around-once , twice , a third time before he stopped , took off his hat , and wiped his brow with the back of his arm . <p> " Stay afloat , " Cosima said and paddled seaward on a line for the platform farther out . <p> Hunt drifted , keeping his head up , letting the current carry him in until he touched bottom . His legs were weak . He got his footing and staggered up the incline . Tracks in the sand stepped down the sea . He followed these footprints into the trees , found Sam 's nickel in the pocket of his pants , and hurried down to the concession stand . <p> " Please , " he said , pushing the coin across the counter to the attendant , " a cherry cone . " <p> " One cherry on its way . " <p> With the chink chink chink of the grinder in his ears he gazed at the sea . Dolphins still played in the channel . Divers launched themselves and splashed headlong into the swells . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the grinding stopped , ice pellets dropped through the chute-a scoop of colorless shot transformed instantly into sweet melting cherry . It was then he decided to take his ice and go up the shore , past nets drying in the sun , past boats getting repairs . <p> Heat hung above the hot sand , making waves in the air . He had n't smelled the nets or the rotting seaweed until a gust blew up from the racks and he recognized the city there in the smell . It had never been anything else for him but a place he created with each breath . It was the air he breathed , and he knew then he would go on creating it until the day he stopped breathing . <p> At Gussett 's Wharf , fishing crews had lashed their trawlers scupper to scupper , three abreast , so that crews from outer vessels could cross to land . They stepped nimbly from one boat to the other , balancing shallow crates of shrimp , squid , and octopus . Deck hands carried red snapper arranged in rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jutting up through a sprinkle of ice . Inside the shed , Hunt watched for a while as they arranged the crates in lots and shook more ice over the catch . They shoveled shrimp into heaps and waited for the auction to begin . Hunt understood that the boatmen were selling and others were buying . That much was clear , but when the auctioneer started his chant he went faster than the boy could follow . <p> The buyers marked cigarette papers and examined the lot being offered . Once he noticed a man nod . Another time he saw a slight lift of a finger , no more . Then abruptly the auctioneer broke off and a man the boy had n't noticed stepped forward , picked a slip of paper from a crate , showed it to the auctioneer , and removed the tray of red mullet as the auctioneer began his ritual again . By then Hunt 's crushed ice had melted . He was ready to leave . <p> Back on the beach he lay beneath a salt cedar and let himself drift . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakers churned the shallow sea . Clouds rode the tops of thermals high overhead . When the warm air got high enough , it condensed , billowed out , and tumbled upward , seeming to stand in place , tethered to the coastline . It made him drowsy . He closed his eyes , only a moment , and felt himself floating . He was drifting , as if afloat on the sea . <p> IV <p> When he looked up again he saw the dwarf standing above him , the little man 's face heavily rouged , his kohl-rimmed eyes set far apart and staring down at him . The sun glared in the sky behind the intruder , who was small but broad-shouldered for his size . Or so it seemed . Maybe his duffel jacket was padded up there . <p> " You-what day is this ? " <p> He knew it was Saturday , but confronted like that , he was n't so sure anymore . " Saturday ? " <p> " Not the weekday-the day of the year ? " <p> " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you will , you will . I 'll see to that . " <p> The boy held himself rigid , not breathing , unable to figure what this person could want . There was something menacing in the voice , something vicious in his expression barely concealed . The sun 's glare blinded Hunt , so he lifted his hand to shade his face . " You 'll see to what ? " <p> " Put your hand down and look at me when I talk to you . I saw you last night , " he said accusingly . " Do n't think I did n't . " <p> Hunt squinted at his accuser , afraid to avert his gaze . No doubt about it . The little man had seen him the night before , had picked him out of the crowd and stared at him openly , the attention uninvited and unwanted . But why , in a crowd of so many , had he singled out the boy ? For what purpose ? At that moment the little man pushed back his jacket sleeve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced at his watch . The boy let his gaze drop . The dwarf 's shoes were worn so thin they no longer had heels . <p> " You-pay attention . The sun 's over the equator at this very instant . What does that mean ? " <p> Hunt shook his head . He had no idea . Was he the only one who did n't know ? He wondered about that and felt guilty , thinking it must be important if the dwarf was quizzing him . <p> " Winter 's through . Time you learned a few things . " <p> Hunt scrabbled to his feet , brushing off . " I have to go . " <p> " Yes , go ahead but remember-it 's the equinox and I 've got plans for you . " <p> The boy stepped out of the shade onto hot sand and went away from the dwarf . Music came from the carousel , its lacquered horses in motion again . He did n't see his father , but Sam Graggs was there . He cast a glance over his shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn-out shoes , watching him . The one o'clock sun beat down from above the equator . Cold weather had been gone for a month at least . <p> When the boy came up , Sam asked , " Through already ? " <p> Hunt nodded . " Where 's my father ? " <p> " He should be back soon . Why not rinse off and change ? He 'll be here by the time you get back . " <p> Looking toward the bathhouse Hunt felt the pressure of melted ice and cherry syrup on his bladder . Relief was just a few steps away . " Okay , will you tell him please ? " <p> " Consider it done . " <p> Hunt started for the bathhouse . The dwarf had come up from the salt cedars and was standing in front of the Tent of Marvels , a cigarette stuck in the corner of his mouth . Coils of smoke drifted round his head as he eyed the boy . " What did I tell you ? " <p> " That winter was over ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You said you had- " <p> " I said it was time you learned a few things . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> The little man took the cigarette from his lips and flipped it onto the midway , then flung his hand up and gestured behind him . " You know what this is ? " <p> " No , not exactly . " <p> " This is the house of knowledge , full of marvels and mysteries . " He seized the boy and drew him toward the closed tent . The grip was surprisingly strong , guiding the boy into the tent . The stench of formaldehyde took his breath from him as the darkness closed round . Moving in the dark was not easy . His legs seemed about to give out . Hunt walked with his hands outstretched , trying to feel his way . <p> " Wait , " the dwarf said and halted . As Hunt 's eyes began to adapt to the dark a luminous figure suddenly appeared , translucent , suspended in fluid . " Trichydra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarf whispered . " Keep moving . " <p> Hunt was pushed forward , then pulled up . He felt the dwarf doing something beside him , bending , his head thrust forward close to a stand . Only then he realized what was happening . His guide was blowing on something that looked like a larva of some kind . It was about two inches long . Suddenly the small object began to emit a red light from a spot at one end as the man 's breath passed over it . Hunt could see the man 's face half-lit in the red glow and twisted In that moment he knew he was lost . " Bioluminescence of a South American beetle . Nature 's magical lantern . Move to the back . Show time . " <p> They went past tanks with creatures floating in them . At what Hunt thought was the center of the tent he saw a nest of translucent tube worms rising from the bottom of an aquarium , waving like seaweed in a current . He realized he had lost all sense of direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear of the tent . He felt the pressure of his bladder as the dwarf mounted a step stool , where he reached out and turned something . A thin beam of light penetrated the dark , pulsing as if repeatedly interrupted . The man 's head cut off the beam when he put his eye to the aperture . He pulled back and turned the mechanism , throwing the area into darkness again . Hunt heard his own breathing , followed by the man 's whisper . <p> " Come up-you . Take hold of this knob and put your eye to it . " He stepped up and felt his hand guided to a nozzle . " Take it and look into it . " <p> The boy did as he was told . Nothing . It was black . " What ? " <p> " Turn it . Do as I say . " <p> Hunt rotated the ring . A circle opened and a blazing light blinded him , causing him to pull his eye away from the ring . Slowly he brought his eye back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning , producing the pulsing sensation . As his eye adjusted to the light he saw a transparent disk and recognized the turning blades of a fan . It was a swamp cooler in a window , drawing air over a shallow pan of water . And through the transparent blur he saw the vague outline of Cosima Lara and , from the side , his own father 's face . In the glare they resembled images on film overexposed . He tried to cry out , but his voice made no sound . Jerking back he lost his footing and tumbled , dazed , blind , suddenly warm and soggy below the waist , the pressure on his bladder no longer an issue . <p> He was running now , stumbling in the dark , bumping into props , knocking things over . Something fell and broke . But he did n't stop . His heart pounded . He could hear himself gasping for air , understanding nothing at all , except that something was wrong . Terribly wrong . And then he was out , not knowing how . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam Graggs , but he kept going , running , stumbling , sprawling , with hot sand in his eyes , in his mouth , and he could n't breathe . And then Sam had his arms around him , trying to calm him , repeating , " Steady . Steady , boy . Steady . " <p> V <p> It was a long time before he stopped shaking . Sam had carried him to the bathhouse and put him under a hot shower , then toweled him down and dressed him in street clothes . That was all he remembered until much later when Sam walked him up the beach away from the amusement park as far as Epworth 's Camp . There was a gap Hunt still could n't fill in . It was hot on the beach as they walked along the water , but Hunt was shivering . When Sam asked what had happened the boy kept silent , averting his eyes . He was n't sure he could repeat it . The dwarf had somehow contrived to do this to him . He did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to encourage it . He thought maybe it had something to do with the equinox and the dwarf 's anger when he did n't know what day it was , but that did n't make any sense . <p> And then Sam must have guessed what had happened because he was saying , " You can not trust everything you see . You know that , do n't you , son ? " And when he did n't answer , Sam continued , " I know what happened . I know . He showed me things in that tent too . Things I should never believe . And you should n't either . Go on home-and forget today . It 's not worth remembering . " <p>
