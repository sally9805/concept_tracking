Cosmopolitan contributing editor Julie Brown offers play-by-play strategies for dealing with your sports  --  addicted man , so you get to score . Photograph Fan plan : Learn to deal with his addiction . // Some of you probably look forward to fall-the chance to break out your boiled  --  wool sweater and bundle up with a cute scarf and snappy beret . But some of us dread it-read it like the possibility of Jenny McCarthy getting another sitcom . Because now it 's football season , and if you have a boyfriend or husband who 's a sports addict , you may as well be single . Okay , so not every guy is into football . Some love basketball , baseball , or even luge , if you consider high-speed chaise  --  longue-ing a sport . But I defy you to get all the way to your first wedding without ever having dated a sports addict . The real problem is that you ca n't spot them at first . They look so normal . And on your first few dates-even if a game is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your eyes ( or at your breasts ) . And as soon as you 've been lulled into thinking you 've met that special guy , without warning , suddenly there will be a screaming , pretzel-eating psycho glued to your couch with a death grip on the remote control . Only then , to your horror , do you realize your man is a sports addict . When I was in my 20s and very young and stupid , I dated an ex-pro football player I 'll just call Mongo . At first we had a lot of fun . He was great in bed , and when I 'd tell him to " go long " or " go deep , " he happily would . Afterward , there would even be " holding . " But then football season started , and he lost interest in everything except watching every single second of every single game of the team he used to play for . Nothing could tear his attention away from the tube . I got so desperate once that I vacuumed naked in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Stop vacuuming , I ca n't see the game . " Within a few months , I traded him for a player to be named later . Addictions are very hard to break , and sports addiction is no different . But as with any addiction , the first step is to admit that you 're powerless over another 's addiction . You can not break it because there are no rehab centers for recovering sports addicts . Some women try to rehab their guy by dragging him to the mall and ensconcing him on the couch outside the ladies ' changing room , but this cold-turkey approach wo n't work , as he 'll inevitably wander off to the electronics department , where you 'll find him semicoherent , surrounded by 50 TV sets all tuned to ESPN . So since you ca n't break the addiction , try to live with it . Hence , these strategies : SPORTS-WINDOW STRATEGY 1 The Cheerleader Approach Make his wacthing a sports event a real event . I remember I used to make my old boyfriend , Mark , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spelling out the name of his favorite team . Making a honey-glazed ham spell Chicago White Sox is hard work-ham does not want to go into a W shape . Sadly , Mark did n't appreciate all I did for him and would shovel in salami with his hand and say , " Hey babe , wan na make a beer run ? ' I did make a run , but it was n't for beer . SPORTS-WINDOW STRATEGY 2 Take Time-Out It 's crucial that you also understand sports time . It 's not the same as real time . It 's closer , though , to our getting-dressed time . When there are two minutes left in a game , after all the time-outs , commercial breaks , and televised privates scratchings-it ends up being more like 15 minutes . ( The irony is that he believes his 15 minutes in sports is really 2 minutes and his 2 minutes in bed is really 15 . ) So do n't be annoyed by the time delay-use it for your own good . For instance , place an order with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in handy , since you could be looking for a new boyfriend anyway . SPORTS-WINDOWSTRATEGY 3 Learn the Lingo If both being supportive and trying to beat his sports addiction do n't work , then why not join him-to an extent . I was unable to watch any more Bears games with the next guy I dated , Ted . But because it 's nearly impossible to communicate with these creatures , I learned their language-their lingo . That way , if there was any chance of coping with his addiction , Ted would be able to understand me . After careful study , I learned that if Ted did n't do something I asked , I could tell him he " fumbled . " If he messed up again , he 'd have " two strikes against him . " Sometimes , though , that would lead to a verbal " face-off , " and when I 'd try to " bring home " what bothered me , Ted tried to " slam dunk " the argument , saying he 'd " walk " if I continued throwing " curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out each others " errors , " and then make up . And after two " rounds " of sex , Ted would want a " hat trick , " sometimes even pleading for " extra innings . " I liked Ted for a while , but after I found out he cheated on me , I " threw him out . " SPORTS  --  WINDOW STRATEGY 4 Take Action During His Distracion During his distracted state , ask for all those things , which , if your guy concentrated on them for even one minute , he 'd refuse . I did . Not long after I was married , I asked my hubby if we could buy a new livingroom set . He said , " Let 's discuss it later . " I took " later " to mean three weeks later  --  in the middle of a Chicago Bulls game . Both Michael Jordan and I scored big that day . He was so entranced with the tube that I could 've had the movers bring in a new sofa that day , lift him up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have noticed anything . Instead , though , I drove to a furniture store , picked out some great new stuff , and was home before the final buzzer . SPORTS  --  WINDOW STRATEGY 5 Betting and Bedding Another step for surviving is to turn your guy 's addiction to your advantage , like my girlfriend Terry did . Her boyfriend is a baseball freak . She deals with it by making bets with him . She says , " If your team loses , you have to take me out to a restaurant . " But if his team wins , she promises 20 minutes of oral sex . He always says yes to the bet because men are so competitive . But it 's a brilliant scheme , because she would probably have indulged him anyway , and since even a good baseball team loses about 60 times a year , Terry 's had many expensive candlelit dinners . SPORTS-WIDOW STRATEGY 6 When the Going Gets Tough  --  Go Shopping Finally , a fun way to deal with your addict is to believe there is a power greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mall . While he 's engrossed in the game , grab his credit card-he wo n't even notice while you take it out of his wallet  --  and bang it out of the ballpark Need a new faux chinchilla coat ? Of course you do , and you deserve a lot more-you 've spent all afternoon making Velveeta spell Go Bulls ! I hope you now see there are other women like you , and that there is life after the ninth inning . Just think positively , be your own team mascot , and go for the gold  --  the 14-karat gold earrings at Neiman Marcus . They 'll look great when you 're modeling that Victoria 's Secret teddy for Carl-your new computer-nerd boyfriend who thinks " sliding into home " means only one thing and would do anything , including turning off his monitor , to do it . <p>
