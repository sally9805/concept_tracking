The first noises had all been dings , mostly , or thuds , but these new noises were all real rumbles and in the walls . Other rumbles had come and gone , but they had been lower down , deeper , beneath her  --  some midnight demon under the bed that had gone away with warm milk or with tea , a runaway train in an underground tunnel , an earthquake once , the devil himself ( who knows ? ) , dogs . There had been a fire once in the maze beneath the street that had flickered all her lights and had made her kitchen smell singey and had made men go down into the ground beneath the brownstones to splice her line , to air the maze , to hunt rumbles . <p> But the under-rumbles before were not like the rumbles now . The under-rumbles seemed to her safer , more distant . For a start , there were all these layers of insulation : mattress , plank , concrete , rock rubble , asphalt , earth , men  --  and the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the cops or you made a pact with God , and the sounds , like as not , would go away ( why worry. ? ) or sink deeper and deeper into the under-hum of the night . But now the rumbles were in the walls . <p> It annoyed her that the new neighbors took no notice . It annoyed her especially because it seemed to her that the rumbles had begun about the same time they had moved themselves in above her  --  mover thuds and men shouting high hog and low hog ; then channel changes and footfalls and unexpected flushes , dish dings at a time when other kitchens would be scraping carrots , laughter in the middle of the day , and even other sounds . Not that she considered the new neighbors responsible , exactly  --  the rumbles , after all , were within her own walls  --  but getting used to the gurgle and breath of new lives encroaching so closely upon her own did make for a certain ear strain , a certain sensitivity . <p> There were two of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish eyed through the peephole in her own front door that opened into the common rowhouse hall and stairwell . They looked nice enough to her , though strangely wavy and elongated . Once , following the woman up the stairs , the man had reached out his hand to grab the woman 's rear and his arm had extended like rubber or pulled taffy , a huge hand at the end of an endless arm , stretching out , following the woman 's undulating rear up endless , whorly , undulating stair . When they dropped their mail or their keys or their gloves , they were all head . <p> At night , she could hear everything about them but their words . <p> Rumbles be damned , she thought . I am a woman of some talent . I am a woman of independent means . I am a woman who has never screamed at a mouse , a woman who has never hollered for a man . I have a glue gun , other tools . I have lovely brushes for latex and for oil ; putty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an electric drill , auto-reverse ; a UL-approved stepladder . There is no end to my options . <p> The anti-rumble work began in the bedroom . It was not scientific work , but it was work that she enjoyed : a project based on the belief that any effort effects a change , and that almost any change can be curative . She would paint . She would transform with color , with texture , and with light . She would change the way the sun , perhaps even sounds , took their hold on the room . She would reassert her presence into the space , perhaps with a post-modern theme or a literary allusion . She was nothing if not well-read . <p> All of the furniture went into the hall : the bed , hammered apart with a linen-wrapped mallet ; drawers full of underwear and sweaters , one by one ; lamps ; mirrors ; great puffy masses of down ; magazines ; letters ; books ; a folding fire screen and a basket of wood ; chairs ; tables ; curtains ; blinds ; loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cookies . Slant board . She realized a complete evacuation was not strictly necessary for painting , but it did seem to her to be appropriate and to the point . Telephone and carpet she covered with canvas . Through the peephole , the decamped artifacts of her life looked curiously unfamiliar to her , the table legs unstable . <p> She was long past the days of masking tape . After speckling and sanding and priming and deciding , she beaded all the edges freehand along her borders . Strong borders , she thought , make a happy room . She concocted her own clean white color for the ceiling  --  more brilliant than Antique Chinese Eggshell but less glaring and demanding than Silver Screen or New Beginnings . It was a somewhat powdery , just-off-porcelain shade she accomplished with extra talc and two drops of carmine concentrate , a shade she liked to think of to herself as Bandage . <p> She never rolled walls . She used a splayed-edge brush . She did window sash and mullions with slant-tip sable . She sponged the chair rail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper dipped in warm shellac . She mitered the corners of all the border papers . She razored the windows . She dimmered the bulbs . It was an exhausting but thoroughly satisfying endeavor : a reclaiming of space , a restoring of order . If for any reason this should not work , she thought , I am prepared to go down to the studs . <p> That night , in the doughy smell of wet paint and plaster , the room rumbled and growled like an empty gut . Hungry . Cold . Powder fell from the ceiling  --  a light surprise snow  --  blanketing the bed , dusting hair and head . She stared white-faced and hollow-eyed into a frosted mirror . <p> Now I am a ghost , she said . <p> I am haunting my own rooms . <p> pre Dear Neighbors , Just a silly thought . Are you doing anything especially rumbly upstairs ? I do n't know , maybe the house is settling , something . Maybe you hear it , too . I do n't know . Just a silly thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you smell gas coming from my apartment , do n't worry , it 's past me . I painted . She had demolished walls before : partitions , really , nothing loadbearing . In a country house once she had found a snakeskin in the insulation , and she wondered what to hope for in the city . It was all a matter of stresses , she had decided  --  a shifting of weight , a change in air pressure , maybe , or the humidity of too many showers or too much breathing . Stress like that , she thought , could make any old house protest , rumble , wheeze . She would find the problem , she felt sure , in the walls . She would unmark it steamer and wallpaper stripper . She would undo it with the thrust and probe of crowbar . She would fell it with Skil saw and English . She felt so lumberjacky , so suddenly unafraid . She took down her French botanical prints and took her Swedish axe to the wall : paper , plaster , lath , stud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fall of her ground-clearing blade . My groves , she said , my copses , my hedgerows , hardly hedgerows , little lines of sportive wallpaper wood gone wild ! Old walls be gone ! She thrilled to their demise , their fronding-down in great green curls , their timber-fall to rubble , their plaster crashes , their heaving-to . She spread her wings in the rising flock of calcimine dust , in the woody air laden with once-living splinter aloft . This is my forest , she said mid-ecstatically . I am hacking away at the flesh of my own trees . I am clearing the plain . I am claiming this land . Out , spirits ! There is nowhere left to hide . <p> But in this huge new room where once there had been three , she found no peace , she could not sleep . <p> Rumbles . <p> pre Dear Neighbors , Good news ! I 'm throwing a party ! Not right away , but probably very soon . And as my closest neighbors , you are certainly invited ! In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs ? Please visit me . Let 's be friends . I have all this space ! Your neighbor . P.S. I bet it sounds like I have been knocking out walls down here ! The mail they got ! The visitors ! The things they had delivered ! And neither one of them home now during the day to receive the arrivals  --  to thank her , even , for taking charge . Slim lineny letters with black engraving . Invitations from probably famous people , museums . Quality catalogues . Scholarly magazines . Significant deliveries that required signatures . Boxes of shirts or out-of-season fruit . A couple in jaunty hats , once . A telegram . Suits . A Bergdorf 's bag from a bicycle messenger . A brown paper package from Minneapolis , Minnesota . <p> She became great pals with the delivery boy from Balducci 's and with the young Korean from the dry cleaner down the block . She was first names with Fed Ex , DHL , and UPS . No one bothered anymore with any buzzer but hers . There were moments when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple upstairs , absente reo . She became somewhat demanding and reduced her usual tip . She took to dressing better to answer the door . <p> The rumbles retreated during the day , but returned full voice in the buzzerless night . <p> Luckily , with the walls down , it was easy to get to the pipes . How she laughed to think she had not thought of plumbing problems before : this most significant , most sensitive of systems , the very arteries and veins of the house , so vulnerable , so frangible , so dependent on capillary action . Why , anything wrong in the body of the house would certainly make itself known here first : any clogging of the vessels , any clotting , any leak , any evidence of hypo- or hypertension , a murmur , perhaps . . . a rumble . Most people , she thought , never even stop and think how it is the plumbing in our lives that makes life itself possible . Why , it probably never even occurred to her neighbors that the same great boiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat into hers . <p> She began by bleeding the radiators . <p> What a pity , she thought , that she could not bleed theirs . <p> But they did not seem to be receiving her notes ; they could not , above their music , hear her knocks on their door . Since the gutting , her own telephone , somewhat mysteriously , had gone dead . No one knows , she thought , the burdens I bear . <p> pre Dear Neighbors , I have your mail . I have your clothes . I have your food . I am shutting off your water right after the late news . I think it may be best if you just give me a key . Your neighbor . P.S. I see you went to Princeton , too ! She had been sweating pipe all her life . She had her own torch , lovely coils of copper solder . God knows she knew her way around the plumbing supply : phalanges and escutcheons and cock-hole covers , fittings and couplings , all the venous valves , speedies and mixers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S as opposed to a P. She still had brass nipples from the country . <p> She was prepared to work through the night . <p> She would begin with diagnostic lappings . <p> With her hands on the supply lines that connected her tub to theirs , she could feel , she felt sure , the very hum of them  --  all the whooshes of life going on above and without her , sudden trembles and warm rushes , slow drips and opening skirls . The heat of her hand warmed the chilly city water that splashed their faces , that swished through their teeth . With an ear to iron pipe , she could almost hear them moan . It would require more wrenching than even I am capable of to save myself , she thought , from all these rumbles . <p> The next morning , when the buzzer buzzed , the buzzer was for her : the building owner 's agent , a man whose shirt , she saw , said Jose , had come by for a little chat . <p> Trouble , Jose said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thuds and rumbles in the night , radiator sizzle , voices in the pipes , decrepitations , crazing paint , and crashing walls , not to mention a decompensating ceiling . <p> Trouble ? Jose said . <p> Big trouble , she answered . Big trouble , Jose . Big trouble upstairs . <p> Upstairs ? Jose said . <p> She opened the door up there with Jose 's key . <p> Better check the roof , Jose , she said . I will check in here . <p> The roof ? Jose said . Cable TV ? <p> When Jose was gone , she locked the door behind him . She leaned back against the door to steady , to detremble . She tested the floor with a tender foot . She entered the light as it fell to the parquet from windows that , here , rose high above familiar trees . <p> Oh the lovelinesses , the lovelinesses , oh my God , my God , she whispered . The air itself , in the blessed light , was filled with fairy dust , with sparkly creatures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no , it was too lovely , too lovely , too lovely . <p> On a table were their books , their change , their notes to one another . There were two dirty coffee mugs , side by side . Two pairs of gloves . A list of errands . <p> He has handwriting , she thought , like my father . <p> She sat in all the chairs . She opened all the drawers . She pressed her face into their towels . She put her hands inside their shoes . <p> In the bedroom , stacks of faded laundry covered the top of their bed : T-shirts , sheets , long johns , nighties , brassieres , sweatshirts , shorts . She wiped her tears with a sock and lay across their bed , mixing in with the softnesses , the snugnesses , the smells . <p> She felt a sensation like having her skull slowly filled with warm milk . <p> She heard a knocking , but it was far away . <p> She heard a rumble but it was deeper now  --  far below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . <p> <p> By Melinda Davis <p>
