The military payloads always come through at night . <p> Janie walks towards the hollow clanking with her arms crossed and the wind whipping her hair wavy and seaweedlike over her face and shoulders . It 's cold for October , maybe only the high forties , and the wind on her cheeks makes the world go blurry . Birds , hundreds of them , fly straight up out of the oaks and magnolias , then get beaten back or sideways . It 's as though they 're launched , then tail away , lacking the power , the velocity to get anywhere near where they want to be . They should just stay in the trees , but then it 's her startling them that makes them burst from the trees with that sonorous beating of wings . <p> At first , watching their strange flights , their sudden cutaways and swoops , Janie thought they were bats . Do bats congregate in Memphis ? Later she finds out they 're a kind of thrasher or catbird . Or grosbeak . Whatever somebody tells her she forgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she thinks , but just as quickly They 're only birds . And under the magnolias and fir trees they make such a terrible mess . See ? The wrought-iron fences are chipping , and the sidewalks are gouached white and black and purple . <p> Still , at least they were n't bats . <p> Janie hugs herself as she nears the railroad tracks . You ca n't go very far in any one direction in Memphis and not run into them . They 're everywhere . The yards seem to expand in girth every time you turn your head . All that growth , like rings on a fat man 's stomach . Somebody tells her no , nobody 's added lines in years and years , but she simply wo n't believe them . <p> The backs of her hands feel good underneath her armpits . She 's pleased at the way her workouts make her feel less rubbery . Janie is a rangy woman . Some might call her petite but she gave up that way of thinking years ago . <p> She takes a deep breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tremendous . It is the kind of wind that whips birds out of trees and the moisture from your eyes . Her feet on the cement sidewalk do n't even sound like her feet . They sound like they 're coming to her from some distance away ; they are somebody else 's feet and they 're coming up behind her , or obliquely from across the street . She turns quickly , expecting to see someone or something approaching , but there 's just the scattering of yellow gingko leaves that have already fallen and the tumble of dirt and grit they always get mixed up with . <p> Rufus is snapping at a whorl of leaves and grit . He barks twice at the foot-high dust devil , then yips as it blows right past him . <p> Rufus is the reason she can walk at night . He 's a black collie mix , five years old , the result of one of Stephen 's prized bitches getting out at night with the neighbor 's black Lab . Stephen was going to throw the whole lot into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire litter of yelping pups , cinch them inside a burlap sack , and heave the whole thing into the Mississippi . " What you ca n't help you correct with dispatch , " he says . Janie hugs herself tighter and hardens herself again and again against him . What does he say about Stevie then , or Peter ? Dispatch . She bets it 's something they say with pride down at the office . <p> Stephen comes every day for the trial , but leaves early . They neither speak nor sit together . Stephen is not a man who likes inaction , and sitting with his hands folded in his lap or his head inclined in his upright palm , his feet jiggling , he is the picture of something wild and untamed forcibly restrained , his obedience temporary , reluctant . Janie ca n't help sneaking sidelong glances at the woman next to him , a blond in a blood-red suit whose gold-and-diamond brooch is nesting where the lapels on her jacket cross . Her skirt and jacket match her lipstick and her hair is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cheerleaders . She is the type of woman for whom sitting next to Stephen is a kind of apotheosis , something she has trained and studied and denied and maneuvered herself for , and Stephen is the result of that denial , the indulgence she gets in exchange for her self-mortification . <p> Which makes what Janie has done a kind of apostasy . <p> As often as not Stephen leaves at the first lull . He gets up , the blond gets up , and then Stephen crosses the aisle and presses his card into Janie 's hand . " Call me if something develops , " he says . He 's given her the card twice now . The blond , who 's very tall , waits with her overcoat draped over her forearms . Janie wonders if this woman thinks she 's stupid or a basket case or just forlornly unlucky or what . It bothers her that she even wonders what this woman thinks . She  --  the blond  --  is probably a woman to whom Stephen gave his business card only once , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he wrote it on a napkin or envelope , went immediately into the Rolodex by her phone . Janie , however , who married him , is given his number weekly . This is Stephen 's way of saying he remembers the startling rapidity with which pieces of paper get buried under or fly out of Janie 's life . No doubt the tall , lemon-haired woman has been told this . No doubt Janie must appear to her to be a very dreary woman . It 's evident in the way she stands , one wool-and-silk-sheathed thigh canted slightly in front of the other . " Oh , yes , the wife . " She 's behind Stephen ; her unspoken " Oh , do let 's get on with this , Stevie " is communicated by her posture . <p> Only a tall drink of water  --  Stephen has always referred to his women as comestibles  --  in a blood-red suit could get away with calling Stephen " Stevie . " It 's probably a liberty with which she experiments . <p> " Call me if something develops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card into her palm . He 's making sure she acknowledges he 's leaving . She knows Stephen . He has no interest in process . Results , verdicts , decisions  --  now there 's something to concern yourself with . He wants to make sure he 's there when the decision is reached . Since he can not make the decision himself , he at least wants to be there when they reach it . The difference between reach and make is the difference between approximation and creation . All a jury can hope to achieve is approximation , a confirmation of what he 's already decided . And his appearance , his being there ( he believed this about their marriage , too ) , will be the cause , the instrument by which judgment is reached and justice rendered . Reasonable doubt and due process are obfuscating intrigues . If he knew this judge he 'd have called him already . <p> Pity there has to be a jury . <p> This is one time Janie agrees with him . She would like to skip completely this business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this whole courtroom business where the simplest facts get worried into meaninglessness or badgered into nonexistence , where every possible permutation the sequence of events could take is given weight and credence , where the trivial " might could 's concerning her son 's death are examined discussed analyzed re-analyzed and cross-indexed for reference . And yet the facts of this case are simple : a drunken boy in a Plymouth convertible struck her son and killed him . What else is there to know ? She wants to stand up and scream at the jury , That boy killed my son What else is there to know ? <p> The card from her husband is made of one of those new materials they use in papermaking now . It 's translucent as rice paper and feels flimsy enough you might poke your finger through it . Or it might dissolve in water . But you ca n't rip it , tear it , or make it go ragged in any way . It is indestructible . <p> She leaves it on the bench when they break for lunch , folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nightline in Memphis . Instead you get reruns of Perry Mason . Until recently Janie always pitied Della Street . Admired her , too , for her beauty and perseverance until one day she simply shouted at the screen , Wake up , would you ? He 's not ever going to love you . He 's just your boss ? and she realized with shame that she had been pulling for the impossible , for something the writers had n't even conceived of , so intent were they on making sure Perry had no life outside his cases . Della Street is an employee , and Perry 's relationship with her is totally , inexhaustibly professional . <p> Is n't that a laugh ? <p> It 's usually after Perry Mason that Janie takes her walks . With Rufus nosing the bushes she 's given up being scared of what most women at night are scared of . She even walks on bad streets  --  anything south of Central is questionable  --  and delights in the tiny thrill that no one else she knows would be doing this in daylight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night when the most trains come through . The military payloads are the richest . Camouflaged jeeps , half-tracks , tanks , personnel carriers , whole boxcars in dull green with black stenciling : TOP SECRET and PROPERTY : U.S. GOVERNMENT . They are long , lumbering affairs , these trains ; the wheels click and clack with a sleeplike rhythm that 's broken only occasionally by the shriek of a crossing whistle . Two short toots , then a long , deep hooooonnng Then a final , brief toot . As a teenager , Janie had been a ham-radio operator . The very idea of speaking to someone in Peekskill , New York , or Kingston , Ontario , or even someplace in South America excited her . Each time she got her chance at the key she was giddy , though her brother Spencer usually hogged it . From eight to thirteen she studied Morse code religiously . By age eighteen she had abandoned it completely . A whole piece of her life simply gone . It was the same way with her belief in God . Walking towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossings with the International Morse Code for " Q. " It 's as though the train itself were a question . <p> At the corner of Melrose and Central she pauses . The lawn at St. Paul 's Episcopal Church is uncut and littered with leaves and dancing candy wrappers . The stop signs shiver , and the amber and cherry stoplights flashing over the intersection are uncertain discs swaying in the wind . They do n't look capable of slowing down or stopping anybody . <p> And then the train goes past and its irregularly regular clacking sounds like drunkards in tap shoes struggling to form a kick line . <p> Janie is filled with a sadness she can not fathom . <p> Thirteen months ago she was just another divorced mother of three . She was having trouble with the rent and the school payments ( St. Catherine 's for Nikki , Memphis University School for Peter , special ed for Stevie ) ; utility bills , bank statements and magazine subscription notices  --  Interview , Newsweek , Southern Living , Architectural Home Digest  --  all tended to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigeon-hole writing desk there , a big one with a high back , and at one time she took great delight in keeping everything separate and prepaid . She filled the empty holes with shells from trips to Biloxi and Miami Beach and the Gulf coast of Alabama and the Florida Panhandle . That was back when she was married and even after , before Stephen realized , or decided , that he could wrench control of her life from her simply by delaying or skipping or scrimping on the child-support payments . Stevie 's medical bills were questioned constantly . He ca n't breathe ? Janie shouted at Stephen once when he asked about the latest round of tests . They say he 's got weak lungs and the air is too moist for him . Do n't you remember when he as a baby He ca n't breathe He 's never been able to breathe <p> I remember , Stephen said . I 'll have a check for you next week , Wednesday or Thursday at the latest . Some things need to clear this week yet . Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his father and then gone into real-estate development . He made his money building in Whitehaven and Collierville and Germantown  --  places where people paid good money to stay away from Memphis proper ( though that had failed in Whitehaven ; it was mostly black there now and the name seemed a cruel joke ) . At any given time Stephen had six or eight projects all going on at once and all of them , he claimed , required his capital . <p> I need it now , Stephen . The children can't- <p> Can wait . People are used to waiting . Or at least they should be . Patience , after all , is a virtue , and whatever happens quickly  --  Stephen went off on one of his important-sounding drones . Janie tuned him out . This was the man who spent ten thousand dollars getting hair to grow on his head , then complained he did n't have any money to send Nikki to a good college preparatory school in New England . <p> She could n't believe she had married him , but things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip with two other women , and two men from a fraternity who had traveled down with them . She was rather taken with George but she ended up marrying Stephen . Stephen , unlike George , was serious . He was tall and thin and wore his hair short about the ears and neck , but long on top and slicked tight to his skull . On the beach , though , his carefully plastered hair whipped about his face and long strands of paleness littered his shoulders as they broke off , bits of scalp still attached to the root ends . He was going to bald early and it touched her seeing it fall off like that . She believed she could fall in love with him in time , especially since he set himself up as Janie 's protector , warding off bullies and generally acting chivalrous . When he first kissed her and she had to pry open his anuslike pucker with the slippery worm of her tongue , she knew she would have to show him everything . But then he wiped his clamlike lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission . He blundered into her with eagerness and love and came out again with grateful torpor . Eight months later they were married . The delay , Janie was sure , was caused by his mother 's hounding him to drop her . But despite the quiet , diffident manner he assumed when in his mother 's presence , Stephen stuck by her . I love her , Mama , he told her one night after dinner while they sipped tea on the porch swing . I love her and I will always cherish her . <p> Sex , Janie gleefully decided at the time , is stronger than blood . <p> A lot of things Janie used to believe have proved erroneous , but that is one idea she has not had to amend . So many things she treasured have been undermined , but that casual , defiant assertion made when she was n't quite twenty still nags her . It 's like with mosquitoes . You slap them and slap them and yet they 're still buzzing , peppering you with bites that swell the longer you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janie knows that , the secretary knows that , every trophy who ends up a wife worried about the next trophy knows that . Even Stephen 's mother , who was cordially distant to her from the very first , knew it . She would never do anything so impolite as tell Janie what an awful thing Janie had done , but it was clear that the horrible thing was not something for which she would ever be forgiven . On the morning of the wedding , though , Stephen 's mother took her aside and issued what Janie at the time took to be a warning , but years later decided was a brief upwelling of compassion . <p> " Remember , dear , " Stephen 's mother had said , " the diamond is never big enough . " <p> Stevie was a blue baby . He kept passing out as an infant and had to be revived with respirators two or three times a day . Stevie would cease breathing and his color would change the way figures in cartoons get hot or angry : the rapid progression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown , to a midnight blue that looked like it came from a fountain pen . She went with even less sleep than she had anticipated ; she was endlessly checking on him , putting her hand on his back to feel the tiny bones rise and fall , or failing that , shoving a compact under his nostrils . Once she brought iced tea out to the yardman and passed the time with him a little , talking of nothing in particular , when she was suddenly seized with dread . Back in the nursery Stevie was a blue ball , curled tight as a shrimp . <p> There might be some damage , the emergency-room doctor said . Janie looked at him blankly . The brain . When he passes out like that he 's not getting enough oxygen to his brain . We 'll have to wait and see . <p> Oh , Janie said , and found herself biting her lips until they were lumpy and sore and her mouth was filled with blood . <p> When she found out later Janie wondered which was worse  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant he 'd always be slow , or that Stephen used Stevie 's slowness as a reason to sleep with his secretary ? She did n't find out until the twins were three . She 'd had inklings of it early in the pregnancy , but had said nothing . She was afraid to believe it was true . When she finally confronted him about it he said , Yes . And Janie in a blind rage told him to move out . To which he said , Thank you . For years , he said , he 'd been piling guilt upon guilt until he was freighted with a moral heaviness so great that he was grateful Janie had given him the green light to shed it . Now , he said , he could live with himself . He could live with his secretary . <p> And Janie was left biting her lips again , wondering how he 'd managed it , a getaway as clean as Gods . <p> The switching yards are so close to Central Gardens that some mornings when Janie 's working she can hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal coupling with metal . It 's as though the trains are lovers slapping each other , provoking desires where none exist . <p> Janie thinks things like this while she 's doing these people 's houses . <p> She has overheard enough arguments to know that more slapping goes on in the world than you 'd think possible . Knows , too , that every bit of violence that ends in lovemaking is a kind of rape the wives wo n't admit but acquiesce to . Sometimes there 's a crack , a sharp little cry , and then the warm noises of two bodies struggling to overcome their own separateness . The warm humming noises of people desiring to meld flesh with flesh into a single flesh . As though such a thing were possible . As though their shouts and cries and exasperated gasps Janie hears from two floors away do n't give testimony to the fact that this can not be so . Janie , listening to them , can look out the windows and see clouds above the treetops , gray cottony clouds stretched until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clouds that look like the pale skeletal bones of long , broad fish . It 's on mornings like this that she keeps the windows open and listens to the trains coupling . They make a more distinct noise than people . But to get the windows open she has to argue . Most people for whom she works like to keep them closed . They have radiator heat and central air and big square rooms with high ceilings . The noise of their house 's machinery will drown out , they believe , the noise of their lovemaking . And besides , why let the outside air in anyway ? For ventilation , Janie will say . I need to breathe . And sometimes they relent . <p> Actually , there is precious little lovemaking in Central Gardens . Mostly she hears it in the newer suburbs where the nouveau riche believe they 're being racy . In Central Gardens she 's only heard it twice , and both times it was after she started the air compressor , then shut it off to bleed the hoses . <p> Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern conveniences they keep to the old way of doing things . The houses are brick or pink granite or white stucco . Built at the turn of the century , they are now occupied by the descendants of the families who built them . There are a few Philadelphia attorneys and chiropractors sprinkled about , but most of the new money lives out east , in Germantown or Collierville . Janie used to live in Bartlett , and worked for those people , but she wanted to be closer to the river , closer to downtown , in a neighborhood where there were sidewalks and where people walked , at least occasionally , for groceries . She also wanted to get away from a neighborhood that was constantly reminding her of the accident . That 's what she calls it , though it hardly seems accidental when you drink on purpose , as that boy had . But " accident " is as good a word as any for encapsulating grief , for letting her speak of what happened without feeling what is raging inside her . <p> Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A.M. it 's only Janie and the live-in maids . The day maids are dropped off at six-thirty or seven by men in boatlike Chryslers and Cadillacs seven years out of fashion . The cars sputter away from the curb spitting oil like an outboard , and with their ruined shocks and the suspension 's swing and sway they really do look like boats riding low in the water . They remind her of her friend Clarice 's car . She 's not seen Clarice in years ; Clarice moved to Savannah and is a morning-news anchor there . It seems odd now to Janie to be at work at six , probably about the same time as Clarice , only Clarice is on TV and Janie 's arriving at a house with live-in maids . They 'll have a biscuit and coffee waiting for Janie , then retrieve the morning paper while Janie unloads her eight-year-old Datsun crammed with ladders , paint cans , shellacs , glues and varnishes . She has wood crates filled with brushes and sponges , drop and oil and tack cloths , varnish removers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rags . Also a box or two of medical examining gloves . Often the owners want the woodwork redone to go with their newly textured walls . They decide this once Janie 's already painting . Then they say they 'd like everything finished by Friday , Saturday the latest . They 're having a dinner party that evening and need the day to air everything out . Could you come in early ? they 'd like to know . We 'd be ever so grateful . <p> Janie , letting her voice go good-old-girlish , says she might could , then quotes a figure that would put a strain on most people 's gratefulness if she were n't so sure they 'd smile knowingly to themselves if she asked for less . <p> Janie used to worry whether she was charging the right amount , too high or too low , and then found out that she was charging what a black painting crew grateful to get the work would charge . She discovered that she could get more work , or the right kind of it , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain pride for her clients in agreeing to swallow too high a fee . But it took her years to figure this out . <p> She comes home most evenings eager only for a light beer and something nonthreatening on TV . For Janie , comfort is a major issue . It disappeared completely when Stephen left and she has been years scraping herself and her family back into the middle class . At one point , right after Peter , she thought God was punishing her for trying to be comfortable . For merely wanting it . But then she thought , given what her clients make , her prices are fair and life is n't . So they 're not connected . Bad things just seem to happen to her . It 's a little the way she is  --  scatterbrained  --  and a little the way the world is . She locks herself out of her apartment , out of her car , leaves her car 's lights on till the battery 's dead , leaves money at the automatic-teller machine . The machine she uses is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that as she 's walking away she leaves her keys , her money , right on the tiny aluminum shelf they provide for just such stupidities . Later she 'll find her keys are being held by a security guard inside the bank , but her withdrawal has vanished . <p> Some people are just singled out , it seems . Major griefs and minor inconveniences : it 's only by size that you can distinguish them . In the year after Peter was killed Stevie had his truck wrecked by a couple of drunk teenagers in a car that turned out to be stolen , Nikki had her car stereo stolen , and Janie herself had backed into a light pole and sideswiped a neighbor 's car while parallel parking . There 'd also been a break-in at her studio and her cat had been run over right in front of the house . Renting in a block where everyone else owns she already feels singled out . Now she 's becoming known as " the catastrophe lady . " The people in the apartment upstairs , a history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was backing her car out of the curved driveway  --  she had snapped the mudflap off previously , and was now smashing in he wheel-well  --  when a deadfall from the pin oak in the front yard landed smack on the hood of her car . The professor 's words to his wife and guests ( they were having drinks on the front porch before the Memphis State-Ole Miss game ) floated out to her . " Some people , " the professor said , " just are n't born to luck . " <p> It was while she was still married to Stephen that she got interested in painting . Stephen thought this was something wives went through , a phase coincidental with pregnancy and childbirth and post-partum depression ( he 'd been reading up on this ) , so he made the arrangements for a nanny , and three mornings a week Janie drove the Volvo to Memphis and took classes at Memphis State . But Janie got good at it  --  watercolors especially ; they were nontoxic , and with kids that mattered  --  and once Stephen moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her degrees . In graduate school she was drawn to oil and clay . That something could be tactile , thick under her fingers ; that she could touch the painting after it was dry and feel the bright dark whorls of color : that was something . A small gallery in Miami took one of her pieces ( " Evening , Lake McKellar " ) for an exhibit of Art by Southern Women : Reforging the Chains , and a Chattanooga collector bought one of hers entitled " Lost at Sea . " This pleased her but she was still dependent on Stephen 's irregular alimony and child-support checks , which were likely to arrive five , eight , fifteen days late , if at all . Stephen would make a big show out of making it up to her  --  buying her dinner in East Memphis , springing Mall of Memphis shopping sprees on the kids  --  but the ripples from this largesse were also meant to sustain them long after the wake of his passing had died against some far distant and unseen bank . His attentions were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by him than they did . <p> She and Peter and Nikki and Stevie were living in Bartlett then . One of Stephen 's townhouses . The children were in a Catholic elementary school . Even Stevie . This was a sign of her rebellion against Stephen , who once commented that a Catholic woman had worked as a receptionist in his office for a time , and she seemed very nice . The lay teacher who had Stevie in her class , however , said Stevie might be best served by placing him in a special class . He 's slow , the teacher explained , he needs special attention and care that in a class of forty-five I ca n't give him . Janie called Stephen . <p> Stephen , she said , biting her lips , Stephen , we need more money for Stevie . He 's been tested , Stephen . He needs special schooling . <p> Special , huh ? His tone was more impatient than malicious . He believed discipline and hard work could make even the slow adequate . <p> Stephen , please . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs special attention . <p> Hand-holding , Stephen said . Then , more softly , What 's this special attention going to run me ? <p> She quoted a figure that he would not have blinked at if she were redoing his living room . A great silence and then a resigned , All right , I 'll look into it . <p> So Stevie went to live with his father and his father 's new girlfriend , and Janie , in the worst way , was happy . She could n't admit this even to herself without acknowledging that a terrible fault resided inside her . Stevie was now enrolled in a school for the retarded outside Oxford . And Janie felt terrible because her life was made easier , because the very first emotion that washed through her was relief . It was not a feeling she trusted . Relief was a spitefully mixed blessing . Those nights she could n't sleep she went down the hall to Nikki 's room . Nikki smelled of just-washed hair . Janie resisted the temptation to slide in beside her daughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to sniff the wet strands of hair still scented with shampoo . It was enough to remind her that her daughter was still there , still alive , still whole . <p> Sometimes the clouds look like they 're big gray swatches of fabric that have been sliced with a pinking sheers . Other times like they 've been ripped right across a straight edge . A tall slate mass of clouds edged perfectly , blue sky trailing . Or that high pale blue with the perfect wall cloud behind . Bad storms  --  sheet lightning , torrential downpours , tornadoes , landfall hurricanes  --  always , always , always with the wall trailing . The professor from the apartment above says it 's because they live at the end of a trough where cold fronts from the north meet the leading edge of stationary fronts that bubble over the Gulf . The systems meet smack over the Mississippi . Hence the dramatic , changeable weather . <p> He repeats the usual joke : " If you do n't like the weather in Memphis , wait fifteen minutes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has to know the reason for everything . <p> 10 <p> The last week of the trial there are no clouds . High ceilings , unlimited visibility day after day . Not even humidity . The weatherman is glowing . It 's February and it is n't raining and the daytime highs are nearing seventy . To unwind each day everyone goes back to the house . It 's a big brick house on Russelford and Janie keeps painting supplies  --  a ladder , dropcloths , wood crates filled with stains and turpentine and paint brushes soaking inside coffee cans  --  behind the porch 's long brick wall . She has n't touched this particular cache in months and spiders have spun webs over everything . Her mother takes a broom to clean places for people to sit . Janie , really  --  her mother says , then stops . Nikki and her boyfriend Louis sit on the porch smoking cigarettes , Janie and her mother on white-cushioned wire-backs . Louis has the soft handsome features of the genetically wealthy  --  soft sculptured cheeks , very dark eyebrows , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing cuffed chinos and no socks , boat moccasins taped with silver duct tape , and a loose-fitting tweed coat over an equally loose-fitting turtleneck . Nikki met Louis at Rolling Meadows , the Episcopal boarding school for the recalcitrant but recovering well-to-do Stephen had picked out for her . <p> Stephen has come to the house . It 's the start of the last week and he feels obligated to be there . First days and last days  --  there 's a gravity to these occasions that needs upholding and he is there to uphold it . Solidarity , he says , making it sound like he 's sympathetic with Poland . He 's the same way about everything . When the children started school he 'd insist on driving them there on day one , and on the last day he 'd collect them as well . He liked graduations , too . First days and last days rolled into one . Gravity . In art he always wanted the first or last in a series of prints or etchings . Anything in-between , no thank you . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the items of real worth . <p> He stays in his car now . The secretary girlfriend ( the first secretary is three ? five ? girlfriends ago by now ) pouts in the front seat . She has lips specially made for pouting . They form a bright red cherry when she sucks in her cheeks . The car is a white Caddy with Mississippi plates . He has a Sunbird registered in Arkansas and a 4 x 4 registered in Tennessee . Janie has no idea what his Alabama car is , and for all she knows he might have a western Kentucky car , too . He likes to keep cars in each state he does business . None is over two years old . After Peter , she told Stephen she did n't want him buying cars for the children , but he bought Stevie a maroon-and-blue pickup , which Stevie promptly totaled , and a Nissan 300 ZX for Nikki , on the grounds she 'd repeat her senior year at Rolling Meadows , thereby qualifying her for Vandy , or at least Alabama or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memphis State or the community college , like her mother . All they know how to do there , he says , is play basketball . <p> Stephen 's window vanishes into the doorframe . From where they sit on the porch they can hear the cool exhaust of the air conditioner . <p> 11 <p> " Janie , " he calls , perfunctorily waving , " we 'll see you tomorrow . " Nobody says anything . Nikki blows at a fly that 's inspecting her knuckle . Janie is thirty-eight but she used to be forty-one . She started subtracting three months ago , one month equaling one year . Now she 's holding . She goes every evening at five-thirty to an aerobics class , and her body is hard and lean . Sometimes Nikki joins her . Nikki is a little soft , the way teenagers get when they drink beer and diet soda and do n't exercise , but Janie has biceps that jump when she paints . Her forearms look like knotted rope , and the slight bulge of muscle on her upper arms shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she has the hard thighs and tapered legs of a swimmer . If her mornings were freer she 'd take up cycling ; stationary bikes lack vista . Small women usually go soft , their behinds widening like plush pillows . Janie is taut as a bowstring . <p> It 's her skin that worries her . She made a point after leaving Stephen of acquiring , and keeping always , a deep mahogany tan  --  he hated that  --  and the effects are showing up now . Fine , tightly woven wrinkles pucker her arms and Legs and face . She looks wiry but unstrung , a little haphazard . Her origins betray her . Working-class . The ladies of the homes she works on say that to themselves , to each other . " Pretty once but ... working-class . You see how that turns out ? They do n't last . They 're like those pretty Negro girls . Or Indians . " <p> These women are friendly to her . They are pleased they have somebody handy with whom they compare favorably . And since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior designer would , they speak to her with a candor they usually reserve for their hairdressers . Rolling salmon-colored paint on to somebody 's living-room walls , or marbling those walls pink or rose or white or magenta , or sponging trompe l'oeil with a wrinkled Baggie , she hears about divorces , infidelities , addictions and neurotic obsessions . They make it sound like staying is obviously preferable to leaving , but they sound so sad in relating this that Janie wonders . All that forced brightness , all that levity . It 's obviously a great strain for them . They have voices that go higher up the register with each fabrication , they crane their necks forward with the earnestness of those who want you to believe , until Janie has to shut her eyes to drive out the picture of these shrill , contorted ladies protesting their happiness . <p> You do n't know , Janie wants to say , having never left . And yet they want Janie , the one who has , to comfort them about staying . They have vested interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janie see ? And does n't she feel awful about leaving ? They are wearing navy wool dresses with pearls . Diamonds as big as pearls adorn their fingers . Clusters of pearls are set about their ears . Janie wears no rings ; she takes off her turquoise when she 's painting , and her brown fingers are stained and dried and stink of paint thinner and Elmer 's Glue-All . A trade secret : Elmer 's , when painted , makes new woodwork look antique . <p> What Janie wants to say to these ladies is , The diamond 's never big enough . <p> But they 've already decided it is . <p> What they want , it seems to Janie , are the spiritual benefits of leaving  --  freedom , release , privacy , space  --  with all the material comforts of staying . She understands completely their desires . She 'd like for them to be true , too . But she wants to shout at each and every one of them , It ca n't be done Do you hear me ? It ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's their neurotic obsessions , though , from which she derives her business . These women ca n't leave well enough alone . The furniture 's all in place , the paintings , the candlesticks from the aunts in Carolina , the antique picture frames , the Oriental carpeting , it 's all in place , but rose , not salmon , is the color sweeping through the formal dining rooms and living rooms of Germantown and Central Gardens and Collierville this spring . No , wait . It 's teal . Teal for the dining room , rose for the parlor . They are conservatives of radical conformity . Which is fine with Janie , since during the slow months her business is mostly furniture work : faux antiquing , marbling , coordinating window treatments with caned radiator covers . Labor intensive and low margin . She 'd rather be doing walls , big spaces she can feel her muscles stretching to accommodate . Territory , walls she can gallop across . Antiquing or marbling a mirror frame is like doing miniatures . Her business really depends on people changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We want to give the place a face lift , " her clients tell her , believing that a certain attention to cosmetics can make everything new , everything better , everything wonderfully , inexplicably alive . <p> It ca n't , she wants to tell them Look at me . Her face is a web of fine brown wrinkles , her arms shriveling berries . And Peter Peter looked so preposterously perfect in his makeup . You could really believe he 'd only fallen asleep in this oddly formal , static pose . A child mumming death . And everyone with the veils and black capes and condolences because this was a mummer 's ball , a celebration people took too seriously . They had assumed too completely their roles . Really , it was starting to get on her nerves ; it was really in very bad taste to continue dissembling like this . <p> At the private showing she lost it . Something gave way completely and she lost it . Nikki keeps telling her this later , getting her to drink water and holding tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You really lost it . Janie had shaken Peter , slapped his face , tried pulling him free of the coffin by his lapels . All the while screaming , Peter , wake up Wake up , Peter Wake up You 'll be late for school Pe-ter Pe-ter And then she collapsed , sobbing Oh , my baby Oh , my baby Oh , my baby until they pulled her away from him . <p> She spent three days driving nails into a piece of clay . She made misshapen hands with stubby arms and drove nails into the palmy lumps . She fashioned a head , a torso . Nails went into the skull , the cheeks , into the chest , the back of the neck where the spine rose humplike into the shoulders . She took bits of plaster of Paris and jammed them into the eye sockets , and wounded the clay further with twigs and bits of stick , with gravel , with green glass . When she was finished it looked like something from a fifteenth-century Polish church . Medieval , full of nudity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in oil for three weeks , drunk on bourbon , Coke , wine , codeine , coffee , iced tea and tranquilizers . She painted almost exclusively in dark yellow , forest green , blood red and black . Each square canvas featured a line of rectangular boxlike bodies with wide shoulders and sticklike limbs . Small rectangles for the heads . The teeth a row of tiny yellow boxes . <p> Recovering now , she wonders how many of these women lose it every day and never tell a soul , never say a word to anyone . Or if they do , make it seem all right even as they relate it to their friends over coffee in the sunroom : Oh , I had myself a good cry yesterday , you know . And the other women nod , and that 's all that 's said about it . A good cry , it 's over now , it 's just sometimes it gets to be too much , you know ? <p> If a housewife screams in a suburb and there 's no one there to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked out of some of the finest Catholic and Episcopal boarding schools in the South . St. Catherine 's , St. Lucia 's , Pennywhistle , Argus , and now Rolling Meadows . Stephen should never have given her that car . There she is , tooling about the Mississippi Delta with a carload of kids doing whippets . That 's what nailed them at the check-in gate . The clink of metal from spent whippets . Nikki claims she was n't doing any . She was only driving home people who 'd partied too much . What am I supposed to do , Mama ? Let them kill themselves ? That always gets to Janie . That plea . She believes everything Nikki tells her . She has to . Nikki is the last real child . <p> The last time this happened , the previous spring , Janie told Nikki , " I just do n't know what to do with you . Why are you doing this ? You 're a fine student when you apply yourself . Why are you pulling these stunts ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , find out , dammit . The trouble with you , young lady , is you listen to every fool who comes along with an idea that might be fun but is n't . " <p> That was what Janie had decided about Nikki originally . When her grades plummeted and she started getting in trouble and St. Kate 's asked her to leave and later St. Lucia 's : it was n't that she was n't smart or was n't good , it was just she listened to the wrong people . She allowed herself to be persuaded into doing foolish things by bad people , and all the time she thought she was doing them some good . Saving them in a way she could n't save Peter . That drinking episode at St. Kate 's , for example . Nikki knew that boy was going to get his liquor one way or another , and he 'd most likely drive himself home later and kill himself . So she bought the liquor for him  --  she looked older , it was only when she opened her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she was the one arrested at St. Kate 's gate for being underage in a car with open liquor . Nikki swore she had n't been drinking herself . And only one boy , the boy Nikki was trying to protect , had tested intoxicated . The other two boys and the girl Nikki was with had tested only " impaired . " <p> It was so silly it was stupid . The girl just did n't think . <p> Stephen blamed the Catholics . " It 's the school itself . It 's lax . I do n't care what they say about discipline . The fact is Catholics are soft . That 's why there 're so many of them . Lord knows , I 've had two Catholic women in the office , and they seem very nice and all , but  --  " <p> " But what , Stephen ? " They had been through all this before . Janie had been a Catholic before she married Stephen . She converted before the engagement . They never breathed a word to Stephen 's mother , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just meant you were biding your time . And given what transpired , perhaps it did . <p> " Let me handle this , Janie . Some things simply need to be taken care of . " Stephen called his friend Hollister , whose own daughter went to Rolling Meadows , and the arrangements were made . Nikki would start late the spring semester , take summer term , stay the next fall and spring , and the following fall be at Vanderbilt or Ole Miss , her grades finally high enough to justify placing her there . The extra year of school would n't hurt and being a nineteen-year-old freshman might even give her a leg up on things . <p> " Stephen , let 's just get her through the first spring , all right ? " <p> Janie wished she could send Nikki further away to school  --  something in Connecticut or New Hampshire or Vermont , where Janie had gone several times on vacation . But Stephen bought a hair transplant and started poor-mouthing himself . Besides , he wanted to know , what was so terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only Nikki might do better someplace else . <p> She 's going to do fine , Stephen said . <p> In celebration of her anticipated graduation the following spring Stephen sprang for the ZX . It was fire-engine red with a red leather interior and a CD player with Bose speakers . Stephen was very proud of the speakers . <p> " Stephen , how could you ? A car ? ? She has n't even graduated yet ? " <p> She will , Stephen said . You know she will . She just has to be among the right sort of people . <p> In July Janie went to collect her . The car was being impounded . Janie would have to collect that later . Janie 's only satisfaction in the whole business was that this time it happened at Stephen 's school . With Catholics it 's drink , Janie told Stephen over the phone . With Protestants it 's whippets . I 'm not sure I see the difference . <p> Now Nikki runs around town with her girlfriends and whatever boys are in that pack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's Stacy and Jules and Amanda and Tricia and Beth and Winnie and Joleen and Dierdre and Dixie and Sue Ann and God knows who else . Janie ca n't remember ever having that many female friends . Nikki buys beer for those younger and gets beer bought her by those older . Her face has settled into that Oh , yeah ? sullenness common among teenagers but never present before in Nikki . They hang out at the Antenna Club and the doughnut shop across the street they call Heavy Metal Doughnuts . The Antenna patrons head over there after closing for a sugar fix . Janie herself prefers Huey 's . The burgers are held together with cocktail toothpicks and the acoustical tile ceiling is studded with red and green cellophane-tailed toothpicks driven ceilingward through drinking straws . It 's sort of a tradition , she explains to Nikki , though she 's been here before with Nikki and did n't feel the need to explain anything . At the home of the best burger in Memphis , Janie says , feeling like a TV commercial , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get it to stick . Mo-ther ? Nikki says , rolling her eyes . You 're ruining my life . Huey 's used to be cute , but it 's bourgeois now , bogus . Do n't you see ? It 's filled with old people . <p> Janie wonders when exactly she became old people . <p> Louis , although he seems like a nice young man , is evidently at least partly responsible for Nikki 's new attitudes . Louis has come to dinner with Nikki , and it 's obviously from Louis that Nikki learned her eyerolling . He also says Bogus ? quite often while studying his fingernails . Janie has an image of Louis in ten years saying Objection with the same studied perfection . <p> But that does n't matter right now . What matters is that Nikki is sleeping at various friends ' apartments , Dierdre 's and Julie 's especially , but maybe also at Louis 's and she 's just eighteen . And Janie ca n't say anything against her , ca n't raise her hand though she 's raised her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows that whatever Janie says now she 'll relent on later . <p> Do n't you come back in my house if you do this Do n't you dare set foot in my house And a week later Nikki 's back , raiding the refrigerator with her friends , taking Janie 's books and cassettes , even Janie 's sweaters . Janie 's missing two silver picture frames and thinks maybe one of Nikki 's friends stole them . That 's it Janie screams . Never again do your friends set foot in my house But her alarm system is broken and though she threatens to change the locks she does n't . <p> If Nikki were really to stay away Janie would n't be able to bear it . Over Christmas Nikki goes to Biloxi with Jules and Dierdre , and comes back talking about Eddie . Eddie 's serious , Mom , Nikki says . He wants to call me Nicole . <p> Eddie is a lifeguard . Nikki met him on the beach ( Where else ? Janie would like to ask , but she bites her lip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , like it 's 1963 . Is n't dreamy bogus ? Janie wants to ask , but she does n't say that , either . And she ca n't simply say , That 's nice , because " that 's nice " does n't cover any territory at all . Neither does , What about Louis ? All she 'd get in reply to that is Aw , mom as though the question were beyond belief . So instead Janie risks the one question that matters . Are you using anything ? she whispers , as conspiratorially as Jules or Dierdre might ask her , only without the giggles , and all she gets for her trouble is Oh , mother as though she 's asked her daughter to wear a sweater on a chilly morning when it might be nice later . <p> Janie 's working on a house at Carr and Willett now , a big brick four-square with a two-story clapboard addition in back . They call the addition a hang-on , after the way these homes were built-four huge rooms to a floor , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the addition once eight gigantic rooms simply were n't enough for the way these families lived . Some people have even blown the roof off the attic , built in dormers , and use the extra space for the maids or as a family entertainment center . Before air conditioning , attics were of no use except as a place where the heat could escape to , and even now some people leave their attic windows open so the heat does n't pent itself into an explosion . In other attics , though , window air-conditioning units have blossomed like mushrooms . Janie 's seen some of these attics because she 's been asked to decorate them . Often they 're a room for the eldest son , soon off to or just back from college . To paint these walls , Janie pries off the thumbtacked posters of models in thong bikinis and crotch-hugging jean shorts and thinks , My daughter 's sleeping with a lifeguard in Biloxi , Mississippi , brought up on posters like these . She wishes she could tell Nikki she understands , because she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear it . Oh , mother  --  Janie can already hear that , can hear Peter 's never-voiced Aw , mom as she orders him to take down the thong ladies , posters he never put up , would never put up , and she comes to with a start when she realizes that the wall she 's speckling has nearly dried . The tacky tsch-tsch-tsch of her baggie on the paint finally wakes her . <p> So how does she wake up Nikki ? She can barely wake herself . For years now she has gone off with men she did n't trust . With Kenneth to the Outer Banks , and to Cape Cod with Stan . She went a couple of times with Stan to Wellfleet and Provincetown , and once even to Martha 's Vineyard . They rented bikes and went looking for Kennedys . Stan was a tall man , thin and athletic . The word ropy comes to mind recalling him , and the hair on his head-black , oddly kinked curls going gray  --  was vaguely pubic . She liked to rub his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair grew like lawn seedlings doomed to frost . She met him on vacation . It is n't hard meeting men on the beach . You simply lie there and wait for them to talk to you . And they always , always would . Stan was a photographer . He wanted her to relocate , talked of marriage , said he could get her started in her own gallery , or if she wanted to keep doing walls she could do that , too . He knew a lot of people , artists and craftspeople all up and down the coast . He assured her she would n't be hurting for work . <p> His friends could n't hold their liquor . Janie suspected they waited till they got drunk to say the things they wanted to . Or at least things they ought n't . Janie could n't tell if it was maliciousness or just bad manners . Every time she opened her mouth to speak  --  she usually waited until the evening was well along before she said anything  --  they stared at her as though she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with great quilty breathing , a reg-u-lahr Southern Belle <p> That 's a phone company , Janie said , but she was already outside the circle . The moment she opened her mouth , she had become Stanley 's Memphis belle . Stanley protested but Janie knew it was the same as if he were seeing a colored woman or a Jew . They were the open-minded sort who closed ranks on anyone not from the tribe . You could be different , but only in a limited way . Say as a liberal Republican . One had to stay with one 's own sort , after all , at least in marriage . Until then it did n't matter who you slept with . <p> Janie found this out after she said she 'd stay with Stanley another three weeks in August . She had misgivings but pooh-poohed them . She could postpone her jobs in Memphis , and the two of them would go to Wellfleet , where Stanley knew some gallery people he 'd like her to meet . Ditto people in Boston . She really should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston apartment one day she came upon a cache of ladies ' underwear behind the bureau and hotel receipts mixed in with his correspondence for days she was in Wellfleet and he 'd gone back to Boston on business . " But I was captivated by you , " Stanley said . " It 's your own fault , really . You should n't look if you do n't want to find . " <p> So she was merely an oddity , a Memphis belle he could make promises to and cheat on . Among themselves they would put it cutely : So Stanley 's been fucking the maid again . How perfectly ( choose one ) awful/charming . <p> So how can Janie blame her daughter for a fault they share ? She wants to call Nikki and tell her , Do n't trust anyone possessing both a smile and a penis , but instead she calls Nikki and reminds her that succumbing is not hope , that submission is not salvation , and that it 's not easy , but you can maintain distance and skepticism even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what in tarnation are you talking about ? <p> 13 <p> The boy who killed Peter was a quarterback for Presbyterian Country Day . That 's how she thinks of the blond boy in the blue suit and the blue-and-maroon foulard . When they pulled him from the car he had long strings of blond hair hanging in his eyes and a chin beard of black and blond and rust-colored wires . He reeked of alcohol . She knows this because Peter was struck by a car going sixty-three in a thirty-five zone . And he was not alone . William , a friend , was with Peter when it happened . They were trying to cross Poplar Pike . They were on the curb chatting and there seemed to be a gap in traffic and Peter stepped off the curb . William started , then stopped , then made a grab for Peter 's shoulder . The car  --  a ' 59 candy-apple-red Plymouth convertible , boatsized , with a white interior and fins  --  spun Peter over the front grillwork and up the windshield and spat him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning off a table . Only this penny  --  these were the words her attorney used in court  --  only this penny ended up dead . <p> William said he could n't remember anything . Pieces only . He remembered the car , its looming grillwork , its shriek of brakes , the thud , like the sound of cars colliding , you know ? Only it was n't cars colliding . It was Peter . Peter and the boat . Peter with his cheek bruised and scratched , his legs bent up under him in a way that did n't seem natural unless you were a little kid playing Army and pretending you were dead . Kids die in poses like that . When Janie paints in her sunroom she sees across the street the children with their sticks and toy guns . The elaborateness of their death throes is appalling . They clutch their chests , stagger , throw wrist to forehead as though in a faint , then collapse to the ground , knees first , then shoulders , then their bellies slump , they twitch once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , they jerk , they roll over , they fake electric shock , they throw out the other arm , and then finally , finally they lie still , crucified on their parents ' front lawn , their heads tipped to one side . <p> Peter just had a little dirt on him . His T-shirt and pants were stained and smudged , his cheek was scraped and there was some grit in his hair . He 'd sometimes come in looking worse after working on the car . Surely  --  Janie does n't want to talk about it but she ca n't not . Every day she goes to the trial and watches a parade of human beings she does n't know or only vaguely recognizes all claiming to know her son or the boy who killed him . There are photographs , diagrams , calculations that remind her of high-school trigonometry problems . If Fig . A is traveling from East Memphis at fifty-nine miles per hour , and Fig . B is a stationary object on a curb near Sound Warehouse , what will the velocity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given dry road conditions , a clear day , and six empties clinking about the floorboards behind the front seat ? <p> Each day she goes home with her mother and Nikki and sometimes Louis and they sit on the porch swing or the metal deck chairs in the mild February air and talk about bulbs maybe breaking free of the ground soon and the first flair of forsythia  --  how soon ? how soon ?  --  until she ca n't take it anymore and runs inside crying . <p> Some nights on her walks with Rufus she rolls in the oak leaves and shows up later at Huey 's or the P &H; Cafe with bits of oak leaf and other detritus in her hair . She has three or four or five Lite beers , then goes home and showers obsessively . <p> Her attorney tries explaining due process to her . He is a serious young man with tortoise-shell granny glasses and a neatly trimmed mustache and only the hint of second chin forming underneath an otherwise handsome face . He is married with two children and lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange Nerf ball at his three-year-old son , who tries batting it with a monstrously huge banana yellow Nerf bat with an outsized blue handle . The swings are clumsy , the father relentlessly encouraging . The ball travels maybe three feet . In his offices he tries explaining reasonable doubt and jury of your peers and she 's screaming , Jury of your peers ? Jury of your peers ? How about Peter 's peers ? How about a jury of people hit by automobiles ? How about a row of bloody corpses , huh ? Huh ? Huh ? And her attorney , the mild young man with the round face and the tortoise-shell spectacles calmly lets his blue-suited chest and shoulders absorb her beating . <p> 14 <p> There is a problem with the boy who struck and killed her son . ( She ca n't think of him any other way . ) He 's the son of an appellate-court judge and is a star quarterback . The policeman at the scene recognized this . Eight hours elapsed before they gave him a Breathalyzer test . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , jury , spectators , courtroom personnel  --  that this was a terrible accident but not , repeat not , a criminal offense . The defense attorney , a florid man with iron-gray wavy hair and a propensity for double-breasted suits , fosters this view , repeating over and over that the freshly barbered boy in front of them should not pay a lifetime 's worth of guilt and sorrow  --  he is already sorry  --  and certainly should not be criminally liable for a single moment 's lapse of concentration , especially since that stretch of Poplar Pike-a commercial street of strip malls and dry cleaners and florists and restaurants with funny names like the Halfway House and Ben 's Lobster Supreme and the Normal Barbecue  --  has neither a consistent sidewalk nor a crosswalk . <p> It could , the defense attorney concludes , have happened to anybody . <p> Janie can not believe what she 's hearing . Why has n't her attorney leapt to his feet ? Why is n't he riddling that flimsy argument full of the holes it 's SO easy to poke ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this clean , clinical discussion of what this one boy has so carelessly , remorselessly done to her son ? And to talk of that barbered boy 's suffering Twisted , grievous mess  --  that 's what her attorney said in his opening arguments , and after that Janie could barely bear listening , but she did , she did , and now it 's come down to this calm reasoning , this weighing and sorting of testimonials and pitches for leniency . It could not have happened to anybody . Even the way he says the word is a lie . He says anybody , not anybody . Body body body body Do n't they see Do n't they feel it ? The cold rush of metal into one 's abdomen , the whoof of air dispersing , disappearing ? The internal blossoming of organs loosed in blood ? <p> It 's a conspiracy of concern for the living body over the lifeless one . <p> The boy in question is a prettified drunken quarterback who had the good fortune of being born into an appellate-court judge 's household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dispose of the evidence and not muck up the future for the guilty when what 's done is done for the innocent . <p> That night Janie feels something biting her under the covers . Her legs , her feet , her thighs , it 's even chewing into her pubes . Something is biting her legs or crawling on them while she sleeps . She gets a flashlight and shines it down the length of her torso  --  nothing . Examines every inch of the bed covers  --  still nothing . <p> And yet that morning she has a rash . Red pustules as though an army of something were eating her alive while she slept . Ointment , a hot shower , more ointments help . She still has the rash but it feels less like fire . <p> She makes a notation on the phone pad , " Call dermatologist . Call exterminating company , " then rushes off to court , tearing another mud flap free of her car as she backs down the driveway . There 's a clunk and a scrape and after she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mud flap in the driveway . It looks like a roofing shingle . She tosses it into the back seat on top of some magazines and McDonald 's wrappers . The car is filled with the fumes of thinners and paint . <p> Something is going to happen to me , she says once she 's moving . The window is down and the sun is streaming across her face and the yellow dust motes flutter like leaves . There is a tickling inside her stomach and about her waist . The car smells now of warm dash and upholstery , and the air of wet mold . <p> Something is going to happen to me . She can feel it in the way her knuckles curl over the steering wheel . <p> The rash is spreading . <p> 15 <p> After the trial is like the first day of the trial . Her husband Stephen is there , but he stays out on the street in his white coupe with his black toupee and his red-wool-and-silk miniskirted girlfriend . All he can say when Janie comes up to say good-bye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then he drives off , the engines roaring . <p> Janie 's eyes sting and she thinks it might be from the way the dying sunlight lands on her hands , her cheeks , her eyelids . She looks up through the bare trees and there are high cirrus clouds , brightly white against the palest blue imaginable . They are as thin as fish vertebrae . Is this the something ? she asks herself . Is this the something ? <p> 16 <p> In the morning she stands in her nightgown in front of her dry sink . The dry sink has been in her family for ages . It is high-backed and mirrored . She keeps a speckled enamel bowl and a pitcher on the table , but she showers like anyone else . The bowl is for letters , the pitcher contains dried flowers . She wonders when it was that her arms started to wrinkle , and has her face always seemed this weblike ? Her hair is the color and texture of spun cocoa . <p> Every night for the next week she is visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neither can the exterminator . He checked the mattress , box spring , mattress pad , bolsters , bed frame , sheets , blankets , pillowcases , wardrobe , everything . She has to leave the house for an entire morning while he sprays and pokes at holes . When he 's done he says she ca n't go back in the house for another couple of hours , then she should air the house thoroughly . And what was it ? she asks . The exterminator man shakes his head . Negative , ma'am . It all came up negative . Dr. Polanchard tells her the same thing . Whom should she believe , these experts or her own skin ? <p> She tells the history professor upstairs about it . The poured cement and brick porch is the only covered place outside and they have an arrangement that allows them both to use it . Janie is out there now refinishing somebody 's furniture  --  a bedroom set for a five-year-old with a painted border of leaves and fairies on the bureau 's sides and headboard . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remember . Blue and white , pink and green . It 's so pastel Janie ca n't stand it . But she 's trying to get herself back into some kind of normalcy . Dr. Polanchard says her painting will help . He says throwing herself into her work will help . But that 's a guy thing . She 's too distracted to concentrate . <p> She 's drawing the stencils while waiting for the apartment to air . The history professor listens sympathetically when she tells him about these things that keep biting her but nobody can find anything . She gets going and going about it until she 's telling him that it 's spread to her buttocks and the small of her back . At aerobics the raised hives show through her tights ; her legs have the look and feel of a pebbled basketball . Even the undersides of her breasts are affected . I thought it was prickly heat but it 's not , she says , and lifts up her arm . She 's wearing a tank top , and the hives run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The history professor says maybe it 's stress . He 's preparing a paper on the divorce rates of Nebraskan homesteaders in the 1840s and 1880s . Women were more likely to bring these suits than men were , and that establishes his assertion that emancipation on the Plains began a lot sooner than anybody seems to give it credit . It coincides , he says , with the rise of mental hospitals for the female insane . Surely , he says , this is not without significance . Janie wipes her hands with a rag and nods . She knows he 's in the middle of an affair with one of his soon-to-be-divorced graduate students . It 's just like a man , she thinks , to be writing lectures , papers , even whole books about the emancipation of women while doing that . Dead women , she thinks . Safely emancipated . Dead , free . She throws the rag down , suddenly enraged . Then she discards the notion of telling his wife as soon as it occurs to her . What business is it of hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Can I make you some tea ? the history professor asks . He 's going inside and he 'd be happy to bring her a glass . Janie says thank you and then ' feels his eyes lingering on the sway of her breasts and the jump of her biceps as she rubs stencils onto the bureau top . She allows herself a brief crinkling of smile . After his graduate assistant , she 's next . It will be a silly business , her telling him she 's not even remotely interested while he 's saving face by saying he thought it was her idea , something she wanted . After all , she lifted up her arm to show him her hives . <p> And something is still eating at her . In the mirror she sees bite marks . It 's not just scratching ; there are pinpoints of blood from the teeth . <p> She wonders , Is this the something that 's going to happen to me ? Is this the something ? <p> She paints walls now with a special fury . The marbleized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to them . The customers never notice , except for one woman who asks if maybe she is n't working too hard ? <p> Janie promises she 'll slow down . This is not a business where you can afford word of mouth containing qualifying " buts  --  " . So she practices at being calm , wiping her fingers as though she might be dusting , moving her crates of material about with an intensity of professional purpose . Her own work takes on the frenzy instead . A surviving victim of Francis Bacon meets feminization . That 's what she wants to title her latest . An inverted V of boxlike figures with stick hands and red , bloblike heads flank the familiar prolate hexagon , the painting 's monolithic center . The brushwork is frenzied , the figures hideous , as though , like the clay figure in the living room , they were made of cardboard , plaster , pieces of earth , and branches . Everything beckons to her , the turkeylike flesh and the sticklike arms , the blood-black-and-red bodies , the sickly green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nipples are itching . Her flecking breasts are on fire , and she wants to feed them , she wants to feed them . She throws down her brushes and screams . <p> 17 <p> Months pass . Janie still goes every night to see the military payloads rattle through the switching yard , listing like somnolent bulls . Half-tracks and troop carriers and tanks and jeeps on flatbeds , each machine in camouflage colors or Army green with the white bars and stars and lettering . And the chemical tanks and boxcars , each stenciled DANGER RADIOACTIVE . <p> She just folds her arms across her chest and watches them clank and rattle through . Her attorney says if not the criminal case , then the civil . They can at least get something . Janie pinches her muscular biceps with her thumb and four fingers and watches the veins jump in her forearms . Corded mahogany . There 's a wrinkled sadness to every bit of flesh she touches these days . It 's even true of her new boyfriend , with whom she already knows she wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moisture has been wicked clean away from her life , leaving her nothing but wrinkled sacking . <p> Four jets from the Naval Air Station at Millington make matching razor slices across the sky that unfurl themselves into bleached asparagus tips . <p> Janie ? her attorney asks . <p> Janie comes to with a start . I do n't think so , she says . Then , more definitively , No , absolutely not . <p> But we can win this one , he says . We have a real chance . <p> No , Janie repeats . Absolutely not . Please , do n't ask me again . <p> Nikki has moved in with Louis , though she still writes Eddie . Maybe she 'll marry them both . Or neither . The world is so full of possibilities , and who 's to say polygamy might not come back into fashion ? <p> Janie 's beginning to believe that what she 's received from life are only some of its possibilities . <p> Nikki 's friend Julie has become Janie 's confidante . It is from Jules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gone to see Eddie , who lives in Nashville , and it 's Jules who tells Janie that Nikki 's moved in with her . Janie sees that as a good sign . <p> Nikki is worse off in some ways than Janie . Janie at least knows something 's happening . Nikki has n't a clue . She 's spent the last year being social , or whatever it is they say now when they mean a girl is sleeping around to keep from being alone with herself . <p> By October Nikki 's moved at least partway back home , leaving off books and laundry , though officially she 's still staying with Julie . She wo n't , when she and Julie come back from their dates or wherever they 've been , go inside the house . She and Jules sit on the poured cement railing instead , their backs against two square brick columns , and toss cigarette butts and Lifesaver wrappers and Diet Coke cans and Corona bottles over the railing and into the box hedging . A little trash heap gathers beneath the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She just drops her wrappers out the window . God or the city sweeping crew will eventually whisk everything clean away . <p> Some nights Janie finds Julie and Nikki there after she 's back from a walk and Janie thinks of joining them , of saying , Make room , y'all , but she does n't for the same reason she did n't climb into bed with Nikki years ago . Rufus nosing their hands is intrusion enough , though Nikki leaves her hand where Rufus can lick it and wag his tail happily . <p> When they want her , they 'll ask her . <p> 18 <p> Nearly eight months after the trial and Janie is wondering if she should mark the second anniversary of Peter 's death . Not if , rather , but how . How do you celebrate an event like that ? A party ? Call up Peter 's friends  --  Julie would know , she used to date Peter once upon a time  --  and invite them for a cookout ? Ask everyone to come in dark suits , black velveteen dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those purple funeral flags with the white cross and the magnetic bases and drive Central Gardens into a panic ? ( The dead of Central Gardens are discreetly buried elsewhere . ) Janie does n't know where to begin . She 's driving past the Maryland Arms on Mansfield and Central , however , when it hits her . The Maryland Arms is an exclusive condominium . It 's red brick with green- and pumpkin-colored awnings . Each unit has its own brick-and-stone balcony and underground parking . There 's a wrought-iron fence out front with brick pilasters and a circular drive . Out on the lawn they 've having a party . They 're still setting things out . There 's a large yellow-and-white-striped tent . Yellow napkins , tridents of candles , white lawn chairs and tables . Wine goblets , water glasses , silver place settings , aluminum canisters of soda and great troughs of ice . What Janie can do is get everyone to come over just after this party has broken up . They 'll sit among the rumpled napkins , spilled wine , half-filled water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit slices , and crumbs . The breeze will ruffle their hair and they will all think of long ago , when Peter was alive and the bright yellow leaves of the gingko trees did not seem to mock them . <p> Janie feels the nape of her neck then signals for a right turn into the drive . A curious thing has happened : since late summer the rash has subsided . It is only a rash now , and is centered just beneath her neck , an inverted triangle of raised dots that spreads across her thorax and funnels like water between her breasts . Sometimes she feels it beneath the bra she wears while working out , but that 's just sweat . <p> Janie does a slow turn around the drive . Her car labors in third gear , bucks even , but she 's watching the white-jacketed waiters too closely to pay attention to her driving . Even her rash gets brief attention ; she scratches absently , downshifts absently . The waiters set out butter dishes and mint trays and linen-wrapped bread baskets and bowls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coils lit . They are below the gnat line . Even in October no-see-ums and mosquitoes can pepper your limbs with bites . <p> Bites . Janie is scratching her neck harder as she completes her circuit . She 's still looking over her shoulder as she pulls from the drive into traffic . Three black men are pushing a bright black 300 2X into the drive from behind the building . It 's wrapped like a Christmas present . Footwide red ribbons run the entire length and width of the car . On the Z 's hood sits a huge red bow . She 's watching this vehicle creep up in her rear and sideview mirrors-objects are closer than they appear  --  and so does n't see the larger vehicle from her left that she 's idling into as she rolls out the drive . She does n't even see it 's a truck until it 's two-thirds of the way past her . There 's the single eeeeeehhhh ? of the horn and then her car 's shuddering several feet to the right . Her bumper flies off beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a dropped head of cabbage . <p> It 's a dry-ice truck . Janie sits with her hands at ten and two o'clock , the crushed front of her car pointing at Archer Hall across the street . A Victorian stone mansion with crenelated towers and high arched gables and coppery green gutters and flashings , Archer Hall has been empty since the last owners tried and failed at making it into a restaurant . The Rotary Club has its House of Horrors there each Halloween . Janie is sure the Archers , when they built this monstrosity , never intended for their front lawn to be an asphalt parking lot with fading yellow parking lines , the lot roped off by a cankered chain looped like cartoon ocean waves between short yellow fence posts . Nor did they intend for their house itself to be a joke ghost house , a fund-raising gimmick for a men 's drinking club . But it has , and suddenly for Janie everything is very clear . She sees things in a way she does n't believe she ever has before . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She starts to laugh and cry all at the same time , the tears running down her cheeks and dropping like snowflakes into her mouth and onto her chin and fingers . <p> Are you O.K. , lady ? the driver 's asking . He 's not from around here , his voice is too nasal . Janie keeps staring straight ahead , her hands at two and ten o'clock . The driver is offering her his license . She should reply , do the same . But she simply can not take her hands off the wheel . She holds on tight ; it feels like Play-Doh when you ca n't squeeze it any tighter and it 's a cool snake inside your fingers . Janie ca n't feel anything but that cool inanimate snaking just beneath and outside her grasp . <p> Amazing , simply amazing . She leans her head forward until her forehead touches the top of the steering wheel . <p> Lady , are you all right ? Lady ? LADY ? <p> She lifts her head , smiles weakly , then bites the steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stick between her teeth . She tongues the warm plastic and she is amazed at its rigidity and texture inside her mouth . <p> LADY ? Lady ? <p> She lets the steering wheel go . It 's all right , she says . I 'm fine . I 'm going to be fine , really . <p> Jesus , lady , you gave me a fright . He starts going on about her going into the street like that , just rolling like a trike as he was lumbering towards the interstate . Janie again shakes her head and smiles weakly . <p> Yes , she says . I guess I gave us all a fright . <p>
