Marcia 's parents , who still lived in New Jersey , were truly happy when she came to live in the East again . Her father said , " Hey ! That 's more like it , " when she first told them she was moving to New York . " About time ! " her mother said . Nobody mentioned the years when they had been so bitterly against her . Her parents were old now , and the fights were over long since . And what had they fought about ? Sex , Marcia would say . Sex in various forms . And who had asked them to be so nosy ? Marcia had lived with some men who were not great people , she had danced in a topless club , she had been in one dirty movie that very few people saw . But it had never been her idea to share this news or to try to make it intelligible to them . Her poor parents , how raging and mean they had been . And the whole thing had been one spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most regrettable . For years now she 'd been a regular person who worked at a job , and her parents said , " Sweetheart , you are so gorgeous , " when they saw her , and , " Do n't be a stranger , " when she left . <p> Now that Marcia was living nearby , she could see that her parents had changed quite a lot . They had once been sociable people , bridge players and party givers , but now they hardly went out . Her father was convinced that the teenage boy next door was casing the house when he walked around in his own backyard , and her mother believed that someone was stealing gravel from their driveway . They gave their dire reports with foxy satisfaction ; oh , they knew what was going on , they were well-aware . " It 's a different world , " they said , correctly , although its difference made them read it wrong , Marcia thought . <p> They were still in the same house where Marcia had grown up , a roomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remarkably the same , Marcia decided , when she came for a weekend and was sent out to shop . Mitchell 's Hardware was still there , only with a new sign , and Garfield 's Fine Footwear was in the same spot on Franklin Avenue . Even the shoes in the window looked eternal  --  patent Mary Janes for little girls , brown oxfords for men , pointy pumps for women . <p> On the other hand , where the Sweet Shoppe had been was a store that sold exercise equipment , and next door was a Caffe delle Quattro Stagioni , which smelled deliciously of espresso . The Caffe was all chrome and tile , sleekly authentic , but the woman coming out of the door , as Marcia went by , could have been one of the mothers from her youth . She had a look of breezy competence that Marcia had almost forgotten about , a modest but sturdy expression ; she wore a blouse and Bermuda shorts , and she had her hair in a short , tidy cut ( like a little cap , Marcia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hello , " the woman said . " What are you doing here ? " She was definitely speaking to Marcia . <p> " Visiting the old homestead , " Marcia said . " How are you ? " She had no idea , not a clue . <p> The woman chuckled , a little spitefully , and said , " You do n't know me , do you ? " but from that dark chuckle Marcia did know . It was Kaye Brightley , older sister of Ivy , who had been Marcia 's best friend in junior high . <p> And what was Kaye doing here ? She lived here , had always lived here ; she had a job at the pharmaceutical company on the highway , and she had her own house out by where Heiling 's Ice Cream used to be . " How 's Ivy ? " Marcia said . <p> " In London still . She likes it . You know she 's divorced ? Her kids are fine , they 're old now . She 's good , she 's living with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was just now on her way to buy tomato plants for her mother . <p> " I would n't get them at Mitchell 's , if I were you , " Kaye said . " The really good place is the nursery in East Brook . That 's where Jimmy gets his , and he has an amazing garden . " <p> " Jimmy McPhaill ? " Marcia said . <p> Was nothing changed here at all ? Jimmy had been Kaye 's constant companion all through high school . For a while they 'd had a romance ( of some kind , Ivy and Marcia had done a lot of wild guessing about what kind ) , but this had fallen apart soon , and after a brief cooling-off period they 'd gone back to being buddies . Marcia thought later that Jimmy was probably gay . An opera lover , a sports hater , an impassioned fan of Emily Dickinson . Although now when she thought of him , he seemed corny and avuncular and hearty , someone whose jokes would be all wrong in most gay circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hung around Jimmy as much as he would let them , pale and unhandsome though he was . He had been quite nice to them . He lent them books and made them listen to Gilbert and Sullivan . He took them out for sundaes , with Kaye , and acted tickled by their greed for chocolate , their crushes on the counter guy . Marcia and Ivy were goofy , feverish creatures then ; by the time they were more composed , he was gone . Kaye was always shooing them away  --  " Hey , kidlets , go take a short walk off a long pier "  --  but she put up with them better than most older sisters would have . <p> " He 's a stupendous gardener , " Kaye said . " Every square inch of his yard , back and front , has something sprouting out of it . Every year there 's more . " <p> " Say what you will , " Marcia groaned , " New York does not have real vegetation . They chain down the saplings . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scraggly ginko trees that before she knew it , she was agreeing to go see Jimmy 's place . " He can tell you everything you need to know about tomatoes , " Kaye said . " He 's the one who knows . And then you can get a quick view of the garden , which you really have to see . " <p> Marcia followed Kaye 's car out of the town 's old center , onto a road with a little mall of newer stores , into the hillier , wealthier , more countrified expanses where Jimmy 's parents had always lived . The parents were both dead by now , Marcia had just been told , and he was in their house alone . <p> Even from a distance you could see that these grounds were like nothing else around them . Marcia 's first impression was of an illustration from a Victorian children 's book , with roses on trellises and sweet peas clinging by their tendrils to a fence . Everything seemed lush and innocent . And that was only the side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out into something more formal and rhythmic  --  beds of red and pink and blue , trailing arches of lavender and white , and even a sculpted bramble in the shape of a spire . Marcia , who did not know the names of many flowers , was dazzled by the cunning , intricate shapes , the bell-shaped cups , and the open , flat blooms , big as cymbals , and the cascades of frothy white bushes . Sitting on a bench was a large person in a striped shirt and khakis who was Jimmy . <p> " I did n't know you were coming ! " he said to Kaye . He got up to greet her . He was better-looking as a grownup , more evenly proportioned . He 'd become a broad-faced man with a beard , quite substantial . Still a little soft around the edges , maybe . When Marcia was explained to him , he said , " Well , well , well . " <p> He thought she did n't like him . He thought she still found him clumsy and unimpressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had taken her out for ice cream , and she had acted quite superior with him . Marcia had forgotten all about this part of it . <p> Kaye made Jimmy give a tour of every petal and leaf in the garden , which Marcia was genuinely thrilled by . " What do you think ? " Kaye said . " Unbelievable , right ? " <p> " You 're amazing , " Marcia told Jimmy . " I 'm amazed . This is too much , this place . " <p> " Right , " he said . <p> " This is a whole kingdom here . You must work your fingers to the bone , just to get the tea roses like that . " <p> Marcia was gushing , but he was hard to talk to , and it was often her instinct to flatter men . She supposed she wanted to stop this ; maybe not . <p> " I 've never seen a private garden as incredible as this . " <p> " Shucks , " he said . <p> " No , really . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " That 's what makes it easier , that I had that built here . The hideaway . " <p> " She does n't want to see that ratty piece of architecture , " Kaye said . " Let her sit down . " <p> Uh-oh . Marcia sat down , just in case Kaye thought she was after Jimmy . <p> " Do you like root beer ? " Kaye said . Jimmy was sent inside to bring them some . <p> " This place is incredible , " Marcia said , one more time . <p> " Every night when I come over , he 's playing in the dirt , " Kaye said . " He would n't do vegetables for a long time , but I talked him into it . " <p> Jimmy was back with the root beer in glass mugs . " The Kaye does not believe in ice cubes for this beverage . " <p> If they were n't a couple , they managed to sound like one . And they matched : the primly casual clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were both thinking that Marcia looked foolishly juvenile with her bleached ponytail and her short sundress . They wanted to hear about whatever she 'd been up to . A long story ; Marcia stuck to the here and now . She had a little , little apartment in New York  --  the size of a gym locker  --  and she was a program counselor at Planned Parenthood . <p> " I see a lot of teenage girls , " she said . " You would not believe some of the outfits . They 're a cute group . And quite hip . We did n't know about getting our own birth control at that age . " <p> " Speak for yourself , " Kaye said . <p> " Why , Kaye , " Marcia said . <p> " I mean boys knew to buy condoms . Another idea that 's come around again . " <p> " Car fins are next , " Jimmy said . <p> " We did n't have the risks , " Kaye said , " that they have now . " <p> Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagined her doing any such thing  --  Kaye with her boxy body , her flat voice . When things got wild in America , Kaye was already out of school . Marcia , who was only five years younger , thought of herself as from another generation , on the boat Kaye had just missed . But who knew what Kaye had been up to ? Perhaps she and Jimmy had ventured into those waters , and then turned back . <p> " Condoms are n't the only things we send people out with , " Marcia said . " It depends . " <p> " Better than having them on welfare , right , Jimmy ? " Kaye said . <p> " I 'm not against freedom for anybody , " Jimmy said . " I just wish they had husbands so the taxpayers would n't have to marry them . " <p> " Those stubborn girls , " Marcia said , " turning away those eager husbands . " <p> They probably thought she sounded bitter , which she was not , or not about those things ; heartless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , she still cooed and trilled around them , and when would this end ? She hoped before it became ridiculous . <p> Jimmy said , " Okay , blame the boys . Go ahead . " On that last trip out for a sundae with Jimmy , she remembered now , he had turned caustic when she 'd said she was going to be very , very busy the next few days . " Thank you for your time this afternoon , " he had said . And she had not told Kaye , although she had tried earlier to brag about things like that to Kaye . <p> " Jimmy gets stuck on one idea , " Kaye said . " Who could believe that husbands are the answer ? " <p> " I could n't , personally , " Marcia said . " I 've had three . One of them is n't quite done yet . You ever have one ? " <p> " Not me , " Kaye said . <p> " Me , neither , " Jimmy said . <p> " I got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Marcia said . " I lived in Mexico , and before that I was in Senegal for a while . " <p> " I 've only been to England , " Kaye said . " To see Ivy . " <p> " Where I 'd like to go someday is Japan , " Jimmy said . " I 'd be interested to see the gardens . " <p> " Me , too , " Kaye said . Jimmy had money . What was stopping them ? <p> " Asia , " Jimmy said , " is great for games . " He went and got his mah-jongg set to show Marcia ; the tiles were antique ivory . Marcia said the set was beautiful , but she begged off on joining their tournament , which had been running for years , according to the score sheets . Actually in Mexico , where she 'd had a lot of leisure , Marcia had been quite a passable mah-jongg player . <p> By the time Marcia got advice about the tomato plants , she decided it was too late to drive over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to explain where she was , her mother did n't seem to mind . " I 've been hanging out with Kaye Brightley and her boyfriend , " Marcia said . " Remember Ivy ? Kaye 's the sister . " <p> " I know who she is , she 's been around here for years . Boyfriend who ? " Marcia 's mother said . " I thought she liked girls . " <p> It was Marcia 's first summer in the East in many years , and she had underestimated how hot New York could get . The wiring in her building was too old for air conditioners . She took dips in the municipal pool on Carmine Street , remnant of a nobler civic vision and safe even now , but so crowded it was like swimming on the subway . As a child , she had swum in Russell Pond in Russell Park , a few blocks from her house . The pond 's bottom was as muddy as ever , she found out one weekend ; the water was warm and smelled like tadpoles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost never went in , and most of the morning you had to be a kid taking a class to use it . Several times Marcia swam there in the late afternoon , when the light was bright and dappled . <p> Neither Kaye nor Jimmy would go with her . Too public , and Kaye had once seen a leech in the water . ( So had Marcia , but not lately . ) But whenever she could , Marcia stopped in at Jimmy 's garden before she went home , and had gin and tonics with the two them ; the root beer , it turned out , was only for before three . " Greetings , thirsty voyager , " Jimmy would say . Marcia was still stumped on the question of whether they were a couple or not . They seemed to spend together every minute that Kaye was n't working . ( Jimmy lived off what he referred to as family holdings and seemed to have quite an open schedule . ) They went out for movies and dinners and drives to the country , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bickering as any couple 's . Marcia had never seen them embrace , but they were Episcopalians , as Marcia 's mother liked to point out , and not young . But then why did they live separately , why would n't they marry each other ? Kaye 's house  --  small and ugly , in a new development  --  was bare and provisional inside , as if she were waiting to see about it , although she had lived there for years . <p> On weekends Kaye did go off without Jimmy for a few hours , to play basketball with a group of women , and it was this  --  and her square-torsoed , no-nonsense sturdiness  --  that had given Marcia 's mother her ideas about Kaye 's sexual preference . " And her manner , " Marcia 's mother said . She found Kaye gruff and unaccommodating . " A person who is not trying to be pleasant . " <p> " Mother , " Marcia said . " Nobody goes through the day being girly and sugary anymore . Kaye has a responsible job . She wears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard . She makes a nice living , " Marcia mother said . <p> " They all have to now , " Marcia 's father said . " Am I right ? " <p> Marcia could not imagine Kaye having sex with another woman ( something she had watched in person , in fact , more than once ) , but she knew that watching was unnatural , and so anyone was almost impossible to picture swept away in the mechanics . Marcia herself had never much liked mirrors ; she liked to close her eyes . So perhaps Kaye had known unspeakable splendors . And Jimmy was a whole other set of secrets . <p> Neither of them seemed at all miserable . Kaye liked her job , as far as Marcia could see . She talked about it with a possessive irritation , a pride in its vexations , always , Marcia thought , a sign of love . She complained about how she always had to check every little thing her " people " did without making them feel like nincompoops ; she was probably good at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home for advice about what to wear to a company awards banquet . " A swank affair , " she said . She must have been to this kind of thing before , but she probably knew that her type  --  the dowdy woman of great integrity  --  was n't what was wanted for corporate display ; she was a respected throwback . " Dark red silk would be good with your coloring , " Marcia said . " Spend money . " But they both knew Kaye would look like Kaye , anyway . <p> Otherwise they never spoke to each other outside Marcia 's visits ; neither Kaye nor Jimmy showed the slightest interest in setting foot on the island of Manhattan . Marcia could go for a few weeks without thinking about either of them ; her job was busy and packed with other people 's crises , and at night she had long , ill-advised phone conversations with Alejandro , the man she had left her husband , Mike , for , and also with Mike , who was now living with a twenty-five-year-old but was balking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude , with its peace and freedom , but she was sorry she was never going to sleep with either Mike or Alejandro again . And perhaps with no one else , either ; she knew lots of people  --  men and women both , her age and other ages  --  who did without . She could see the advantages , but she had lived a good part of her life trying to be faithful to the currents of desire , sworn to that , if to nothing else . At nineteen , in the topless bar , prancing around on that little catwalk stage , she 'd thought she was dancing out the most urgent truth , repeating what everyone knew , only more prettily , with her smudged eyes and her rouged breasts ; what a vain girl she had been and how caught up in one single idea . And even later , when she could n't stand to be anywhere near the Carnival Club , nothing had seemed clearer to her than the primacy of sexual feeling . But maybe her own fate was that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could imagine it , or almost . But she would have to move to another line of work , where she was n't all the time explaining to teenagers where their cervixes were . <p> In a general way , she was fine now , with her tiny apartment , her ambling routines , her touristy pleasure in the noise and sociability of the New York streets . She had a few old friends here from other places , and a few cronies at work whom she liked . In autumn the weather was clear and pleasant ; Manhattan ( she told Alejandro ) was a handsome city , garbage and all . <p> In the brightest part of October , Kaye called to ask if Marcia wanted to come spend a weekend with them in the country , in a house Jimmy 's father had owned , near the Delaware Water Gap . Another relative used it in the summer , but Jimmy would n't leave his garden then , and Kaye said they liked it in the fall . " Come be a leaf peeper , " Kaye said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I promise . " <p> " You always missed the autumns in the East , " Mike said , when she told him she was going . <p> On Saturday morning she took the train to New Jersey , where Kaye and Jimmy met her at the station , and they rode over highways whose bordering trees were suddenly blazing with color . All that miraculous color , the backlit leaves glowing against the sky , made Marcia fiercely homesick for Alejandro and for Mike , for things over and done with . <p> The house , which had been quite isolated when he was a kid , Jimmy said , was now on a road dotted with new chalets and A-frames . In the afternoon , joggers of all ages went past and waved to the three of them on the porch ; they sat sipping bourbon and sodas , Kaye 's drink of choice for the season . The hillside behind them was dazzling . <p> At dusk they went inside , and Kaye brought out a Scrabble set . " Do n't let Jimmy try his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were clever players , both of them , good at placing their letters on the high-scoring squares and reusing q 's and x 's ; Marcia was beaten badly . " The Kaye is unstoppable tonight , " Jimmy said . <p> In the kitchen , Kaye stood at the stove , with a bib apron over her wool slacks , and made them what she called a lazy dinner , chicken baked in some sort of salad dressing , not bad . " Children , " she said , " you may pick up your drumsticks . We 're in the country . " <p> Would Kaye have made a good mother ? You could say she had the life of a suburban matron , without the family to go with it . Had she been cheated of her best fate , or would she have been one of those sour , hotly resigned mothers of Marcia 's childhood ? If Kaye mourned the road not taken , it did n't show . And she did have Jimmy , who at the moment was gnawing away intently at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird than this , " he said . " Not if you shot it yourself . " They were three middle-aged adults without children , although Marcia had at least done things you would n't want kids along for . Not that anyone was handing out medals for that . <p> " In Senegal the chicken , when you got any , was as tough as shoe leather , " Marcia said . " At dinners , conversations would hit these long pauses while people were chewing . " She noticed she wanted to brag about herself , where she had been and with whom . <p> " I 'd like to go to Africa , " Jimmy said . <p> " He does n't even have a passport , " Kaye said . <p> " Actually , mine is expired , too , " Marcia said . <p> " Really ? " Kaye said . " This shocks me , about you . " <p> " Oh , boy , " Marcia said . " My current life would really shock you , then . I do n't do a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jimmy said . <p> " Do n't ask , " Marcia said . He looked sly and laughed his old laugh , a hawing guffaw . Marcia felt very racy , not happily . It might be harder than she 'd thought , spending a whole weekend with the two of them . <p> But then Kaye brought out the dessert  --  do-it-yourself sundaes , with fudge sauce and Reddi-wip and shredded coconut and a jar of walnuts in syrup . " You do n't do this all the time , do you ? " Marcia said . <p> " Sure we do , " Kaye said . <p> " Sundae comes once a week , " Jimmy said . " Is n't that the idea ? " <p> " I 'm in heaven , " Marcia said . <p> Where were Jimmy and Kaye each planning to sleep ? That was the question . Marcia 's own suitcase had been taken to a dark corner room with sloped eaves , charming in a gloomy way , across the hall from the master bedroom , whose open door showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stuff on the floor . When they all went upstairs to bed , Jimmy went into this room , and Kaye stood in the hall saying , " Sweet dreams , " and then she went into another bedroom , next door to Marcia 's . That 's it , then , Marcia thought , I should have known . <p> Marcia was probably glad , more or less . Lying in the single bed , under a weighty mound of wool blankets , she liked to think of all three of them tucked up in their separate realms , cozy enough . Like children , or like commendable old people in a British novel . To each his own , she thought . <p> But in the middle of the night Marcia was awakened by a single , soft cry . From Jimmy 's room she could hear gasping and short , quick breaths . Ah , well , she thought , let them , but she felt like a man in the audience at the Carnival Club , trapped in his own rapt attention , dumb and hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the owner had said . What else is interesting ? ) Then Marcia heard Kaye calling , " Jimmy , Jimmy , " but the voice came from next door , from Kaye 's own room . The door opened , and Kaye ran out into the hall . <p> It was not sex  --  what was wrong with Marcia , that that was all she knew about ?  --  it was a medical crisis or a bad dream . Marcia was probably not wanted in the second case , and she lay still for a minute  --  Jimmy 's voice , a low monotone , seemed to be reassuring Kaye  --  and then she got up , anyway . How could she pretend not to have heard ? Was n't she here in the house with them ? Kaye turned on the light just as Marcia stood in the doorway , and there was Jimmy sitting up in bed , red-faced and sweating ; he looked as if he 'd been boiled . His hair and his beard were as wet as a swimmer 's . <p> " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I woke you up , " Jimmy said . " We should 've put you downstairs . " <p> " He has medicine he takes , " Kaye said . " Do n't worry about it . Go back to bed . " <p> " Sorry , " Marcia said , and got out of there . <p> Oh , Jimmy , she thought back in her room , you could have just told me . How long had he had night sweats ? Kaye 's face had been heavy with a tight , mournful anger . But they might 've kept her away from the house overnight , if they really had wanted to keep all of this private and hidden . <p> Perhaps Marcia was not supposed to say anything about it to them . As if she did n't hand out pamphlets every day urging people to be get tested in four languages . She wondered if Jimmy had a wild and separate nocturnal life with other men , or a longtime lover he just did n't tell people like her about . Jimmy acted as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet he must know . <p> At breakfast Kaye was still angry , or plenty miffed , at any rate . " I tell him to just do the basics to take care of himself , " she said . " It 's the least he could do , do n't you think ? Does he get monitored by the doctor when he 's supposed to ? No . Does he exercise at all ever ? No . Not him . " <p> " He has to be careful . It can make a big difference , " Marcia said . <p> Jimmy , who was sitting right across from them spooning up his cereal , said , " He has to put up with everybody 's free advice . " <p> " What are they giving him ? " Marcia said to Kaye . <p> " That 's another thing , " Kaye said . " Nitroglycerine pills dissolved on the tongue  --  that ca n't be the best they can do for angina . Really . Does that sound like a nineteenth-century treatment or what ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a nineteenth-century organ . I have a quaint , outdated malady . " <p> Marcia saw Jimmy 's heart , a sequestered valentine , pulsing in its wine-velvet casing . Apparently she was never going to guess right about it . <p> " Your father took those little nitro pills , " Kaye said . " How state-of-the-art can they be ? " <p> Jimmy carried his bowl to the sink and walked out of the kitchen . <p> " None of my beeswax , " Kaye said . " That 's his little way of letting me know . " <p> " Is he all right ? " Marcia said . <p> " He 's not all right , " Kaye said . " He knows he 's not . " <p> " You ca n't make him take care of himself if he wo n't . " <p> " Who , then ? " Kaye said . " Who else ? " <p> Marcia was about to say , He has to do it himself , but that was just some California jive ; perhaps it was her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his merry , pigheaded way , " Kaye said . " He leaves it to me to worry . I 'm the one . It 's my job . " Kaye was washing the breakfast dishes as she spoke . Steam was rising from the sink like a staging of her ire . <p> She went at the counter with a sponge , scouring hard . " He just goes off . And you see how he leaves the kitchen . Look at this crud . " <p> " You could ignore the crud , " Marcia said . " That 's kind of my philosophy . " <p> " Yes , " Kaye said . She went on rub-a-dub-dubbing . <p> " Do you do this whenever you come out here ? " Marcia said . " Clean the house ? " <p> " Well , I have to , " Kaye said . <p> " Mike , my husband , was a great housekeeper , " Marcia said . " I think I got neater because of him . " <p> " Jimmy has n't gotten neater , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closet . Marcia followed her into the hallway , where she began sweeping . <p> " I 'll do something , " Marcia said . " Do you want me to do something ? " <p> " You 're the guest , " Kaye said . <p> Kaye was raising a lot of dust , attacking the floor with great lunges of the broom . She seemed invigorated by her proprietary housework and her wifely griping . Marcia sat down to watch her and felt left out . <p> Music came suddenly from the living room . A jolly tenor was telling them that he was the captain of the Pinafore and a right good captain , too . " Ah , " Kaye said . " He 's put that on for me . He 's sick of it , but I still like it . " <p> Jimmy came out of the living room then , doing a little two-step to the chorus that was giving three cheers and one cheer more . If it was his way of ending their quarrel , it worked . Kaye knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dustpan for her , and they bobbed around in time . " What movie are we in ? " Marcia said . <p> After this Jimmy went out to get the Sunday paper , and when he came back they all sat in the now dustless parlor and read through every part of the paper . Jimmy and Kaye muttered at the articles and read bits of news aloud every so often , and they did the crossword puzzle together , seated next to each other with rival pencils . What if sex were just taken out of the world ? Marcia thought . Kaye and Jimmy were like an illustration from a book explaining how this could be done . <p> What would you do if you were blind ? What if you could n't walk ? People always imagined how their senses got sharpened , their appreciations grew within a smaller focus ; less stood in the way of their attentions ; they became keen and sharp . Marcia was remembering all this . <p> " This puzzle was designed by a sadist rogue computer , " Jimmy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Marcia said . " A little pre-lunch constitutional ? " <p> " Jimmy sort of has to take it easy today , " Kaye said . " Normally I encourage him to move his butt , but now , no . " <p> This meant that Kaye was not going , either , and when Marcia took off for a quick stroll , the two of them waved to her from the porch . It was not Jimmy 's fault he had to rest , but they were both so generally quiet in their habits , not to say pokey . Marcia always felt young and coltish next to them , but she was n't so young , was she ? <p> The weather was not as bright today  --  a white sky , a dampness in the air  --  and the foliage looked less fiery , but still panoramically terrific . Marcia went around gathering up the best leaves , the deepest reds and flashiest combos ; she did this for something to do , but also with the idea of sending a few in the mail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When she got back to the house , Jimmy was napping on the porch , and Kaye was inside reading a mystery and looking drowsy ; neither of them could have slept much the night before . Marcia showed Kaye her leaf assortment  --  " to send to a friend in California . " <p> " Press them first , " Kaye said . <p> Kaye did n't ask anything about the friend , which disappointed Marcia ; she seemed to want to speak about him . " My friend Alejandro , " she said . " Who 's never been north of Marin County . " <p> A little flush of affection for Alejandro had crept over her on the leaf hunt . " My pen pal , " she said , although really they were phone pals . <p> " I see , " Kaye said . She did her knowing chuckle . <p> " He 's a total Californian , " Marcia said . " He 's never been to New York . " <p> " I 've never been to the West Coast . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming probably in the winter , " Marcia said . " I like the idea of showing him the snow . " Why was she saying this ? She was making it up . <p> " Better tell him to bring a lot of layers to wear , " Kaye said . <p> " I told him to wait till spring , but he wants to come after Christmas . " Marcia knew it was childish to lie like this , but she could n't stop . She did n't even want Alejandro to come , she was fairly sure . She watched Kaye 's expression , which was mildly amused and a little put out that Marcia had been keeping secrets . <p> " It 's so small in that apartment , " Marcia said , " but we 'll manage . " She could n't help it , she felt better . " The man snores , " she said , " and hogs all the room in the bed . " <p> Over lunch , which was BLT sandwiches , Marcia said , " I used to cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce in California , " Jimmy said . <p> " Alejandro likes to cook . It spoiled me . On camping trips , even , we ate well , " Marcia said . " You would n't believe I would go camping , would you ? " <p> " There are trails around here , " Kaye said . " Somewhere . " <p> " We had good equipment . One of those dome tents , one of those amazing lightweight sleeping bags . It was Alejandro 's stuff , actually . " Kaye looked amused again . <p> By late afternoon , it was time to drive back ; Kaye and Jimmy did n't like to drive at night . On the highway Marcia was afraid they were going to want to play one of those family car games  --  count all the signs with S in them , that sort of thing  --  but instead they listened to a tape of The Mikado . If you want to know who we are , we are gentlemen of Japan . Kaye insisted on driving , although Jimmy looked much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drives like a nut , " Marcia said . " He 's good , but he 's too fast . It 's hold-on-to-your-hat time when he 's behind the wheel . " <p> " That 's California , is n't it ? " Kaye said . <p> " Are you freezing ? " Jimmy said to Kaye . " You look like you 're freezing . " He took off his cardigan and put it around her shoulders . It was one of those old man 's sweaters , droopy and gray , and even from the back seat it made Kaye look like Margaret Rutherford . " Better ? Okay ? " Jimmy said . What scared Marcia was that she was starting to envy them . <p> " It 's the way Alejandro takes the turns , " Marcia said . " Too much . " <p> She was making Alejandro sound pretty dashing . He was actually a fairly quiet person , aside from his driving habits . She did n't think it was Alejandro she wanted to see , but he was the phantom object of desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even now , Marcia thought she did n't really understand what life was without this , and she hoped she never knew , but in time it was likely she would . How little she had imagined before now , how slender her horizons had been . <p> " Campers , " Kaye said , " I see a Dairy Queen ahead . What do you think ? " <p> " Let our lovely guest decide , " Jimmy said . <p> " Stop we must , " Marcia said . <p> Listen to this , will you ? she thought . Incredible . They had her talking like them . <p> The girl behind the counter at the Dairy Queen wore puce lipstick heavily outlined in brown , and she made Jimmy repeat his order three times . Marcia talked to girls like her all day ( you could win them over by just admiring their earrings ) and had once been that girl , but Jimmy was rattled . Marcia put her arms around Jimmy and Kaye while they waited . " Hello , three musketeers , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> They took the ice cream  --  two double chocolates and one vanilla-chocolate swirl  --  and they each tucked into their cones with a happy concentration that Marcia decided ( with some effort , and it was n't easy ) not to see as any sort of erotic pantomime . It seemed to be her job to take on innocence now , a trait she had never admired or had any use for before . And she was doing fine at it . Oh , who would have thought ? <p> " The intrepid travelers find refreshment , " Jimmy said . <p> <p> By Joan Silber <p>
