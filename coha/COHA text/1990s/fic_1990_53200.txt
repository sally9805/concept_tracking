On his first day at the new job , Joe Frisch was assigned a Haitian woman . Frisch , a refugee himself from grad school , sat at one of a dozen identical metal desks in the Boston office of the Department of Public Welfare , while his new boss hovered over him with one buttock on the desktop : Gillooley , an ax-Marine , a big man with hairy forearms and a small wet mouth . He caressed a file folder on his thigh . <p> " You 've been studying where ? BU ? " Gillooley asked . <p> " Harvard , " Frisch said flatly , as he 'd planned . <p> " Oh  --  O.K. Across the river . Econ ? Poli Sci ? " <p> " No , actually , anthropology . " <p> Gillooley laughed . " The study of Man , right ? What makes him tick , how we 're not so far from the apes as we like to think ? " <p> " That was about it . " <p> " We must look like apes to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would n't say that . " <p> " Were you doing any particular , you know , tribe ? " <p> Gillooley 's head was earnestly cocked . Frisch tried to judge the degree of his interest ; he felt clumsy at interpreting signs and was afraid of seeming a fool his first day . <p> " It 's really not all that interesting . " <p> " Depends on who 's asking , right ? And since I am . . . " <p> " No , of course . It was the Lugbara from Uganda . I was looking at the social organization in their land tenure system . " <p> " O.K. " <p> " Especially the significance of plowing . How it relates to social function . " Frisch caught himself and looked up into Gillooley 's fat-narrowed eyes , where he thought he saw a glint of mockery . " That was about it , " he said again , and then quickly retreated . " I wanted to get out into the real world for a change . " <p> " And here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal desk , as if the real world was directly under his buttock . A faint smile was spreading over his face . " Now let me tell you a little about this tribe we 've got here in Boston . We do n't want to know why they do what they do or how we 're connected to them . I 'm not going to say an ape could do your job , but I will tell you not to make it more difficult than you have to . You 'll never need to leave the office . You 'll spend a lot of time on the phone . No one expects you to bust ass working for DPW , and I for one do n't want you to go looking for the complications in the simple things the way they taught you across the river . You 'll have eighty cases at a time , and the way to think of each of them is like this . " <p> Gillooley opened his folder and flipped the files over his thumb . <p> " You mean as similar cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I mean every case is the quotient of eighty divided by eighty . That may not sound nice , but once you start treating them like essay questions instead of true-false it 's all over . Involvement-burnout , I call it . It does n't do the clients any good . Am I right ? " <p> Frisch nodded , feeling he ought to salute and charge off into dangerous enemy territory . But the ex-Marine was saying no dangers at all . <p> " So it 's mostly paperwork . " <p> " More of the same thing . If you wanted to get your hands dirty , " Gillooley said , " you should have been an archaeologist . Parlez-vous francais ? You learned some French across the river ? " <p> " A little . " <p> " Then you can start putting all that tuition money to use . I 've got your first case for you here . " <p> Frisch caught himself looking around the office for a human being , an ape , a quotient , when he realized Gillooley was pulling the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : <p> " Nadine Guerrier . Age , thirty-nine . Three children , eleven , six , and three months . Occupation , maid . Status , non-immigrant visa . That means she 's illegal . She 's from down in Haiti and most of them are illegal . " <p> " Is Guerrier really her name  --  warrior ' ? That 's great . But French would n't do any good , " Frisch suggested . " Most Haitians speak only Creole . " <p> " Not this Haitian . She used to be one of the haves , just like you are . She was a bank officer down there before she left her husband and everything else and brought the kids here . I do n't know why she came and I do n't care , though she must have been a damn fool to do it , and pregnant , too . That 's not my business . She 's here , and she 's living in the homeless shelter near Central Square , which means trouble for you . " <p> " Why trouble ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the rental market going crazy while you were off studying Man . If you were a landlord , would you rent to someone who had no address ? " <p> Frisch considered . It was a question that , across the river , had never remotely occurred to him . <p> " Obviously you would n't . Like I said , do n't complicate what 's already simple . You 'll do just fine . What was your name again ? " <p> " Joe Frisch . " <p> " It sounds like a longshoreman name , " Gillooley said , walking off . " Maybe you did n't belong over there anyway . " <p> Mrs. Guerrier looked nothing like her name . After lunch , instead of the Amazon Frisch had begun to imagine ( daubed in war paint , plastered with cock feathers , the one breast cut off for archery purposes , and a look of murder in her eye ) , a thin-boned woman made her way unobtrusively toward his desk . She walked slew-footed , holding her purse in both hands like a supplicant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip-on canvas shoes , and a scarf modestly over her hair . The hair , or maybe the high cheekbones , pulled the skin back and narrowed her eyes Orientally . <p> Each waited , awkward with the ceremonies of welfare . Finally Frisch asked if there was a particular reason why she 'd come . <p> " Oui , Monsieur Freesh , simply the particular reason that I and my children are exiled from all places except the shelter . And as you are my caseworker I hope ardently you will resolve our little housing problem soon enough . " <p> Her French was soft and correct and rapid , sprinkled with the technical English of the welfare bureaucracy  --  shelter , caseworker , housing , heavily accented  --  the way a foreign tourist picks up Quincy Market and Beacon Hill after a few days . <p> " You 're learning the language fast , " he told her . But Mrs. Guerrier , who was n't here on a tourist visa , merely clucked . Frisch promised to let her know as soon as something came up . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six divided by six . <p> That night , across the river , Frisch lay on his couch in the dark with a plate of tortilla chips and melted cheese warm on his chest . Through his living-room window , the model on the billboard above the gas station was still tasting the freshness of Salem , in her eternal moment of fulfillment . Between them , thirty feet from his apartment , the building 's dumpster was smelling less fresh with every week of summer . Lately it had begun to breed flies . The window screen was torn but Frisch had lacked the initiative to fix it  --  to do much of anything , for that matter , since leaving grad school . <p> He had decided to drop out while book-hunting in the labyrinthine anthropology library one night . Frisch had thought to himself : What if a plow was just a plow ; then what would the world look like ? The day before , he had lied to his advisor about the progress of his dissertation , and now , in the library , Frisch immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacks , he heard a laugh , a cackling shriek which echoed through unknown depths of absurdity , and he knew he did n't want to read another word about Man . Plowing , signifying , kin-killing , simian Man was a creature that had nothing to do with him . Frisch had made it his business to find that things were not as they seemed , and it finally left him with the sense that the least real thing of all was himself . So , surprisingly , he acted : he got out . <p> But after that , Frisch did n't know how to act . Never having thought of himself as anything but a student , he discovered he was living on a street of sub shops and funeral parlors and aluminum siding that were . . . not exactly threatening , but foreign . Unreadable . Shed of anthropology , he had no place among them . He took out a subscription to The New York Times , and it arrived every morning in its blue wrapper with news of ethnic violence and stock prices : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch he tried to acquaint himself . He read every word , including reviews of plays he would never get within two hundred miles of , sports he had no interest in , hockey and horse racing . He read the paper while the TV was on , while urinating , while reading something else . He 'd stopped trying to wash the ink off his fingers . <p> Stacked issues rose under the window like an inner wall , now close to four feet high  --  layer upon layer of newsprint , millions of words . The papers had begun to crowd the small room and block his view out the window , but he could n't bear to haul them to the dumpster . During one stretch he spent seventy-five consecutive hours in his apartment . Bells from the game shows his widowed neighbors watched all morning rang through his walls like the tolling of a whimsical doom . <p> In the end , financial need forced him to move . An article about a social worker in the Bronx planted the idea that the Department of Public Welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of abstraction . <p> But throughout the first day , he had hardly lifted himself out of his swivel chair , the file folder open before him , words , words , words . He might as well have brought the Times . <p> The plate on his chest was empty and grease-spotted and cold . Frisch , thinking of bed , had begun to doze . <p> The phone rang : shrill , then twice more insistently . <p> What the hell time was it  --  after eleven ! He got out from under the plate and lumbered to the phone in his bedroom . <p> " Jo-seph ? C'est vous ? " <p> " Who 's this ? " <p> " Mais c'est mod , Nadine Guerrier . " <p> " Oh , Mrs. Guerrier . " For a second he thought of hanging up . " Yes ? Oui ? " <p> " Have you found it yet ? " <p> " Found . Found what ? " <p> " But the apartment ! " <p> " The apartment . No , not yet . But I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't even had time to look ! " <p> " Ca va . Forgive me if I woke you . " <p> " No , no . I was just  --  no . " <p> " Merci , Jo-seph . Merci d'avance . " <p> For several days Frisch sat chair-bound at the metal desk . The job turned out to be not so easy after all . Things were clear enough on the typed page , the names and social security numbers ; but the nearer he got to the clients themselves the more elusive they became . When he phoned , children were crying in the background , music pounded , and his case spoke in low reluctant tones , or in an unintelligible Spanish accent , or too fast . And in the flesh there was no connecting at all . An endless stream of clients paraded through  --  some vague and evasive , others pathetic , a few hostile . He could hardly distinguish them and remembered nothing about them . He felt himself to be nothing but their paranoid or listless fantasy of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man limped in , sixty and deteriorating . Longish hair stuck out under a Red Sox cap , his nose was squashed into the rashed skin of his face , and he smelled of fish and strong medicine . In the harshly lit interview cubicle the man 's story came out in a manic burst from which Frisch tried to pick the useful shards : a slurred tale of divorce , furnished rooms , lithium , lost custody battles , lost checks , lost years : told breathlessly as the old man leaned into his face and breathed sourness . But all Frisch could piece together was a relief check that had failed to arrive because the man had been evicted and was staying at a halfway house . <p> " We 'll track it down and make sure it gets to you . " <p> But still the man did n't leave . He had a listener , and the check was buried under the detritus of words . Frisch had to stand him up and walk him out to the glass doors . And even then the man would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's elbow kept him for five more hopeless minutes on the sidewalk . <p> Frisch rode the subway home . Underground , on the platform with its strings of bulbs , he found it hard to breathe . Commuters appeared in the grimy light , and suddenly the old man 's vacant face was coming at him . Frisch hurried away and wedged himself onto the train . The doors heaved shut . The train flew through its passage . He tried not to look where the man stood . A seated woman , obese and pale , burdened with shopping bags , fixed her eyes on him , and as the light in the car flashed , she seemed to laugh , her throat quivering with private hilarity . The closeness of bodies , of cotton , leather , sweat , breath , bellies , thighs , surged and nauseated him . He closed his eyes , and all the week 's faces from the cubicle pressed in , mouthing their tales , carrying their underground smells  --  bad fish , strong medicine . Here was Man : garrulous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened his eyes And these passengers , too  --  all of them . What secrets would seep from them in the cubicle ! He squeezed through the clot of bodies upstairs . On his way out he realized that it had n't been the old man at all , but a guy in a business suit . He smiled and wondered at his panic . Yet even outside in the warm dusk he had trouble drawing air . <p> As he let himself into his apartment the answering machine beeped . He ran for it and hit the replay button . Someone from school ! Joe , where have you been hiding ? It rewound quickly . <p> " It 's me . And the apartment ? Nothing new ? I and the children wait . Or perhaps , Jo-seph , you have some room in your own , since homelessness is not among your afflictions . " <p> Bitch ! Goddamn her . The impudent bitch ! So was she the only one of his cases he was supposed to be thinking about ? Did n't she know she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got calls from no one but her . As if he was alive for her . And his own apartment  --  Jesus ! The woman stopped at nothing . He immediately erased the message . <p> The next morning the office smelled of smoked-down cigarettes . When Gillooley was occupied Frisch slipped out a copy of the Times and managed to read the entire front section . He started in on sports , then quickly forded it away and made a phone call . <p> " Is that going to be for yourself , sir ? " the secretary of the realty company asked . <p> " No , not for me . It 's for a client of mine and her children . It 's  --  sort of an emergency . " <p> " A fire ? " <p> " No . Not really an emergency . They 're living in a shelter . " <p> " Oh , I see . Let me look . No , I 'm afraid we have nothing at the moment , but if you want to try back in a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frisch asked , " Where else can I try ? " <p> " This is for a low-income family , sir ? " <p> He acknowledged it as though she 'd caught him in a lie . <p> " You might try O'Malley Realty . " <p> He picked up the sports section again . But he could n't get through a paragraph . For a minute he glanced from paper to phone like an animal too dumb to move . Then he dialed information . <p> " O'Malley Realty , please . " <p> But as soon as the man at O'Malley heard the word Haitian , Frisch could feel him politely shut down for business . And Frisch turned to other cases , for they had begun to pile up . <p> But she appeared at the office the next afternoon  --  or rather , her ghost , in the form of a note Gillooley taped to Frisch 's desk . <p> A case of yours has made trouble for you , Nadine Guerrier . She went over your head to the Housing Authority with a negligence complaint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's new here . <p> Frisch thought that Gillooley for all his tough wisdom was dead wrong . She would n't ease off : he felt her trailing him as tenaciously as a shadow . He got the number for her shelter and dialed . A harried elderly woman answered . <p> " No , Nadine is not here . No one can stay in the shelter between eight and six . It 's the rule . " <p> " Does she work somewhere during the daytime ? " <p> " As her caseworker should n't you know that ? She 's a maid at the Travelodge . " <p> The Travelodge receptionist did n't know of any Nadine Guerrier ; maids were in and out all the time . But she transferred him to the laundry room , and there a Hispanic woman recognized the name . <p> " But I 'm sorry , she gone for the day . She have fourteen rooms to clean and after she can go . " <p> Frisch started to ask where she could be reached and then realized it was futile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city somewhere , at a McDonald 's or riding underground , no address or number . He would have to wait . <p> On opening his apartment door he listened intently : silence . But Frisch to his own amazement was not relieved . It was the urgency of her beep his ear had cocked for . <p> In his bedroom he phoned the shelter . This time a pleasant young woman spoke . <p> " No , I do n't believe she 's  --  wait a minute , she just walked in with her kids , I 'll get her . " <p> A pause , the phone was knocked about , then a tired voice came on . <p> " Allo . " <p> " Mrs. Guerrier ? It 's Jo-seph , your caseworker . " <p> " Mm-hmm . " <p> " How are you ? " <p> " You 've found it ? " <p> " Mrs. Guerrier , I 've been trying to reach you all afternoon . No , I have n't found it . You 've simply got to be more patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Housing Authority is a last resort . Let me try and explain about the housing situation here in Boston . " <p> But she would n't let him . " Monsieur Freesh "  --  for now he was back on formal terms  --  " I quit Port-au-Prince because my husband had become insupportable , a Duvalier of the household . I left with my belly swollen , ardent with hope . Do you know what hope means ? In Haiti we say Amerique and we think of freedom . I have come to Amerique , but no freedom . I can not leave the shelter at night , even to buy some milk for little Yves , who has lived his brief life in this concentration camp . Freedom ' After work I ride your buses , for I have nowhere to go until six and my feet hurt . I open your papers and I see apartments , apartments for rent . I look out of your bus and I see buildings , buildings everywhere . Monsieur Freesh , are you saying that among all these apartments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amerique there is not one for Nadine Guerrier and her children ? Not one ? " <p> She waited for an answer . But Frisch had no voice . Not so much her words but her furious conviction had paralyzed his throat ; under its influence he saw again the Amazon , this time in a sundress and scarf , and riding one of the Transport Authority buses ; but with a wild blood spot in her eye . <p> " For example , " she went on scornfully , " I read Camb . beaut. 2 BR heat a/c ' - what does this mean , a/c ? " <p> " Air conditioning . But that place goes for eight or nine hundred a month . " Her ignorance and the hard numbers revived him . " Everyone wants to live in Cambridge  --  me , too . Yves ' AFDC only comes to $430 a month and you ca n't get a subsidy because you 're not a legal resident . And you do n't have any proof of income because you work off the books . There are thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands maybe . You 're not the only one . It 's a question of money . " <p> " Of money ? Jo-seph , you have perhaps a dime in your pocket ? " <p> What lunacy now ? <p> " Or a nickel , or even a penny ? Read what is written there on the back . You see ? E pluribus unum . ' What does it mean , Jo-seph ? I had Latin at the lycee and I can tell you . One out of many . A question of money ? You put a dime in the telephone  --  e pluribus unum . You go out to buy cigarettes , a newspaper  --  e pluribus unum . Get on the subway  --  e pluribus unum . Yes , there are many looking , but I am one looking , and out of these many it is for you to find an apartment for this one : moi ! " <p> She hung up . <p> Frisch went into the living room and turned on the light . Flies were everywhere . Flies buzzed inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they already circled toward the light of the overhead bulb . Thirty , forty , fifty of them had entered in the heat of the day . Frisch spent the rest of the evening on the couch , trying to read the limes . But flies crisscrossed his head and he had no peace . He began to kill them , and found it easy to do : in the summer heat , fat from feeding off the dumpster , these were sluggish flies and one after another he destroyed them with the rolled-up Book Review . Eventually Frisch turned wholly away from reading to killing . He hunted down individual flies with a personal vengeance , cajoled them and then abused them with obscene names , gloated over their smashed bodies . He threw them away by the handful . Finally word must have reached the dumpster that a maniac was loose in the room , and the flies stopped coming . But by then the Book Review was stained with the blood and meat of the fly dead , and he had to throw it out . <p> Frisch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for minutes on end , maybe hours , that the phone was about to ring . Then it was the buzzing of flies he heard . Ringing became buzzing , buzzing ringing . He was swatting at the answering machine , erasing the flies . Once or twice his face twitched and he started . At last he drifted off ; the phone held its tongue . <p> The next day was symmetrical . It began and ended with a lie . <p> " Has Mr. Gillooley come in yet ? " he asked the receptionist on the phone . <p> " He usually does n't come till 9:30 . " <p> " Tell him Joe Frisch has a fever today . " <p> He 'd woken up knowing he was n't going to get anything done from the office . After all , Nadine Guerrier on paper was a bad bet . But in person , concealing nothing , he felt he could persuade some individual of the urgency of the case and the harmlessness of giving this woman a room . He 'd woken up , no phone ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling its urgency himself . Least of all because of the Housing Authority . Let the bastards do their worst ! Only , Mrs. Guerrier had become a heavy , elusive weight on him , like a troubling dream whose details escaped him . But she was not a dream ; and now Frisch had a thing to do . He did n't understand how she 'd found her way to him and become this compulsion , but he knew that he could turn off the answering machine , unplug the phone , and still he would have no peace ; she would come and beat on the doors of his head with her thrilling Amazon war cry : " I am ! I am ! " <p> The code of the classifieds played through his mind : 2 BR htd. a/c w/w e-i kit . The mystery of hieroglyphics . But the symbols stood for real rooms , somewhere out in the city . The only thing to do was what Gillooley had told him not to , go out , hunt down the one apartment  --  he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To hell with Gillooley , then ! And to hell with her ! He would go . <p> His method was simple : buy a Boston paper , scour the want ads , then make a few phone calls for appointments . He shied away from the big realtors . They had fees , and neutral-sounding secretaries who threw up insuperable barriers . He was after the small landlord , the gravelly or anxious voice that suggested a flaw and thus a human being who could be reached . But they were so few  --  Boston seemed owned by an alphabet soup of companies , ERA , AAA , AL-MAR , and Boston had shrunk to its high-income neighborhoods . He cooked up just six appointments , spread out over the day and far and wide in the city 's districts . <p> To none of them had he mentioned Haitian or shelter . That would come face-to-face . He was just a man looking for a couple of affordable rooms . <p> It was a sultry July day . The first landlord was a guy named Fred Furbush . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Mission Hill overlooking the hospital and the old mission church . Furbush , eating a frozen fudge-nut stick , was a big , slow-moving man of about forty ; the flesh had started to droop off the long mottled face ; everything about him spoke of the unseen hand of gravity . But when he opened his mouth a surprising voice came out , husky , clipped , a fast-talker 's . <p> " You Joe Fritz ? Fred Furbush . Shake . Hey , that 's tough to say ! Good thing we 're not brothers . Guess if we were you would n't be Fritz and me Furbush . Place 's around the corner . Six-fifty , right ? First come first serve  --  last place went like that ! " He snapped his fingers and caught a dribble of chocolate off his chin with the back of his hand , which he licked . Frisch was troubled by the figure . He thought the ad had said seven hundred . <p> They sweated uphill and turned a corner , down a flight of concrete steps and along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of backyard were strangled with weeds and tires . Furbush produced a set of keys and opened the back door , which admitted them into a dark hallway . A light bulb overhead revealed cracked plaster , linoleum flooring . Below street level , surrounded by triple-deckers , the place had no natural lighting to speak of . So each room was only the sweetish smell of rot until the landlord flicked on a light , and even this did n't dissipate the gloom . It seemed the windows had been sealed shut . <p> " It 's a quiet place , " Furbush said . " Nobody bothers you here . " <p> " Did you say six-fifty ? " Frisch thought it was a place where you could die without anybody bothering you for weeks . Maybe someone had died here . Still , he could n't be selective , he just wanted a room . <p> " No , six hundred . I could ask eight easy . That 's the magic of real estate . For years Mission Hill is a slum . Then , boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did the hill get taller ? The view get better ? No ! It all happens on paper and in people 's brains . " The landlord put the fudge-nut stick to his own oblong head . " Now you got permit parking only and rents going crazy . It 's a whadayacallit , a self-impacting phenomena . One guy does nothing on his own . " <p> " There is n't much of a view from here . " <p> " Do you want people looking in all the time ? Anyway , you got that nice yard you saw on our way in . People kill for that . You and your wife ? Girlfriend ? " <p> " No , actually it 's  --  " <p> " Oh , a friend maybe . Well , look  --  can I call you John ?  --  to be frank I 'm kind of anxious to rent these rooms . An apartment is like a pack horse , it gets unhappy when it 's not doing its work . So I 'm willing to make you an offer . In exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much , just straighten up the yard , put out the barrels once a week  --  I 'll let you have it for five-fifty . A steal . A steal . " <p> Frisch had brought this moment on himself . As he spoke the truth Furbush 's mouth drooped open , showing chocolate stains on the lower teeth . A nervous smile appeared and the landlord 's eyes flitted between obscure points in the half-light . <p> " O. K. , I see . That changes things a little . Why did n't you just say so ? Now listen , John , I got a family lives a couple blocks from here , they 're blacks and they keep the place fine and pay the rent . I got nothing against this Haitian of yours . But I 'm a landlord , and a landlord has to get the rent every month like a fish needs water . If it was like a wife or relative , I could understand , but you say this lady 's in a shelter ? Like a homeless shelter ? How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Frisch , remembering Gillooley 's warning of trouble , found his mouth had gone dry . <p> " What I need is something like a signed piece of paper from some individual with an address and a bank account . Somebody who 's there on paper . In real estate if it 's not on paper it does n't exist . This lady , this Haitian  --  it 's like she does n't exist until I get it on paper that so-and-so hereby certifies he will guarantee and so forth financial support at his own liability , get his name on the lease , for the rental until such-and-such a time . Then like magic your Haitian exists , and I 'd be glad to rent to her at seven hundred like I said . " <p> Furbush folded his thick pale arms across his shirt , into which he was perspiring heavily . He was still holding the fudge-nut stick , licked clean , upright from his elbow , as if this were the pen to sign with . And Frisch had actually begun to visualize this document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal sentences in small type and a line at the bottom where the signature would go . They both knew whose . Mentally he crumpled it up . <p> He came out onto the street and blinked as his eyes adjusted to the yellow haze . He began walking downhill toward Huntington Avenue . A honking knot of traffic was snarled at the light ; the sun bounced harshly off chrome bumpers and mirrors . He started in the direction of his next appointment , toward Lower Roxbury , but he was still thinking of Furbush . The whole time they 'd been deceiving each other . This burrow had obviously lain empty for months and Furbush could n't unload it . The magic of the market had priced him out . But in Frisch 's desperation he 'd seen an opening and lunged at it with his phony sheet of paper . Guarantee ! Who would sign such a thing ? What liability  --  everything he owned , the shirt off his back ? For a woman he 'd never heard of until last week ? Better if he never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist , on paper , on his answering machine , or anywhere ! She , who had sent him out on this mission to accomplish a task that was perhaps not humanly possible . <p> But she did exist . And he had the task . And Frisch discovered that his calves sprang him forward on the pavement and his eyes were dry and alert in the humid air . He had time , the scenery was new  --  he would walk it . Surprised by this energy after the weeks of confinement , surprised that the tingling in his palms was not irritation , he felt some secret hand must be flat against the small of his back , pushing . He would n't have put it past her  --  an Amazon with wings , gliding over the city , intoning on her flight : " I am ! I am ! " <p> By the time he reached the address off Mass . Avenue , a two-mile walk , the dirty sky had gone gray and his face was oily with sweat . He was on a lonely industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and almost as far as the railroad tracks , among building materials warehouses and packing plants . The side streets , with condemned houses and occasionally a playground , were mostly black . Frisch felt this to be in his favor . But the man who answered the door was white : Powers , a retired fireman , looking like a smaller Alfred Hitchcock done up in wax . On this hot day he wore a polyester jacket and his shirt buttoned all the way to the double chin . <p> Powers showed him into his own first-floor apartment , where he lived alone . The third floor was for rent . Through the kitchen window , out on the street , a black man was working under the raised hood of his car . Powers offered Frisch a drink of water . They sat at the kitchen table ; on the counter were packets of powdered macaroni sauce and paper plates . <p> " You must have walked from across the river . " <p> " Feels like it . " <p> " It 'll be a summer storm by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to the news on the radio . I do n't get out much so I hear what it 's doing outside from the weatherman . Well , I 'm glad you showed up when we agreed . You ca n't trust people to be where they say they will anymore . Everything 's going bad . " <p> The man spoke warmly and seemed to want to talk on , but this time Frisch came right to the point . " Mr. Powers , this apartment is n't for me . I 'm looking for a woman I know . She 's Haitian . " <p> " Haitian ? " Powers suddenly comprehended . " You mean colored ? You 're here for a colored ? What is this , some kind of trick ? " <p> " Why would I tell you straight out if I was tricking you ? " <p> " There 's no way , mister . I do n't like the sound of this at all . " Powers ' tone had altered so completely that Frisch thought he might actually take the glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state or something . Undercover . " <p> " I 'm not working for anyone but myself . This woman is a friend . " <p> But Powers ' waxen face had filled with blood and as his eyes watered he exclaimed , " I 've got to keep the neighborhood safe . Five blocks this way you 've got Cambodians , the other way Spanish , right behind me it 's deep African Roxbury . It 's like a war here . " His pent-up screed burst out in facts and curses and fantasy and universal truths , accumulating wildly colored shreds into one great ball of indignation that was bouncing Frisch 's way , so that all he could do was move aside to avoid being flattened . <p> When the man had spent himself , Frisch said , " Listen , Mr. Powers , I 'm not talking about all those other people . You have n't even seen this woman . How can you know you do n't want to rent to her if you have n't seen her ? " <p> " I 've seen enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living here . " <p> They were both standing at the table . Frisch knew the game was up , but he did n't allow himself to leave yet . He wanted to persuade Powers that he was what he represented himself to be . He wanted to overcome the man 's wild suspicions with the simple truth of her case . He wanted to point out the truth of Powers ' own situation , too , that the blacks were right outside his kitchen window , that Powers was warring against shadows the way he , Frisch , had battled flies . He wanted to sit Powers down and put an arm around him and share a drink  --  for he was sorry for the man . <p> Instead of doing any of this , he asked , " Have you got a bathroom I could use ? " For suddenly he needed to urinate . <p> " Toilet 's broken . " Powers waited for Frisch to leave ; and , there being no reason to stay longer , Frisch left . <p> His next three appointments , farther @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one answered ; at the third a woman told him that the apartment had lead paint and so children under five could n't stay there . She smiled sweetly but held her ground behind the screen door and would n't let him in . <p> By the time he came out onto the street it was after seven . At the corner was a subway stop on the Red Line , one that would take him directly to his stop . He could go back now , feeling he 'd given it his best shot , to his own apartment  --  for homelessness was n't among his afflictions  --  and put some tortilla chips and cheese into the oven , then maybe have a look at the Times . But he knew he was going to do no such thing . Mr. Powers ' summer storm was moving in off the bay , the sky groaned and heat lightning flashed across the brick factories and the expressway . Frisch had one appointment left , all the way back in the South End . <p> He retraced his steps along Mass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he walked quickly , the salt wind at his back : past the industrial buildings and the rows of decaying triple-deckers and the newer projects that were already graffiti-defiled ; under the elevated tracks of the old Orange Line which now stood rusting and useless , and then past the sparkling new line ; into the South End , the streets being repaved , the liquor stores and fish markets giving way to warmly lit bars and theme-restaurants , the brick townhouses with rounded bays looking more attractive in each block he passed , many with building permits in the windows . On one wall he saw a sign posted , then taped to successive lampposts : " $500 Reward for Information Leading to Rental of a One-Bedroom Apartment . " Someone else was hunting , too . Streams of people were moving in , and they would cough up half a grand for a hot tip . The whole area was being remade . But what had changed except ideas about the place ? Furbush had been right , it all happened on paper and in people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach even Powers , in his isolated garrison , and rescue him from the siege of shadows . Then what ' Other shadows would move in , and they would yield to others still , and so on , and rents would rise and fall , and buildings , too , and nothing real would abide . A Haitian woman without papers or proof of income would still be waiting to exist . And he would have come up empty in this small assignment that had been given him . <p> A groan , like train doors closing , rose with force from his belly . It shook him entirely . He groaned for Mrs. Guerrier and her kids , now shut in the shelter , for the distorted faces in the cubicle , Furbush and Powers , and his own long sleep  --  for the one impossible room behind all the facades on all the streets he had passed that was actual . Somewhere ! Somewhere ! There , that one , that one ! <p> The sky had turned purple . The blacktop smelled of coming rain . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an island dividing the street . He approached Number 17 and rang . A light came on in the hall . For almost a minute latches and locks were undone . Then the door cracked open and a woman peered out . She was black ! An old woman , thin-faced and wrinkled , her gray hair combed frizzily upward . <p> " Who is it ? " <p> " Mrs. Nash ? I have an appointment to see an apartment . " <p> " It 's rented . " <p> The blood drained out of his face . " I 've walked all the way from Dorchester Avenue  --  " <p> " I ca n't help that , " she said . " Maybe if you took the bus you 'd been here on time to get it . " <p> A ragged sprinkle had begun to wet the front steps . The old woman stepped back into the half-light of the hallway . <p> " You 'd best go on before the rain catch you . " <p> But , without any purpose in mind , he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an apartment all day . " <p> " I ca n't help that neither . Things is tight everywhere . " <p> " Is it so much to try to find just a room where you can put a person ? " he went on , smiling to control the feeling in his voice . " There 's thousands of rooms . All of these buildings have rooms . I 'm just looking for one . But instead I 'll have to go home now . " <p> " If you got one home what you looking for another so hard ? " <p> He told her . She frowned at the improbability of it , but as he unraveled his coils of details the old woman 's face softened . Finally she seemed to believe him . " So you ai n't here for yourself . Well , I wisht I could help you but I ca n't . " <p> Still he lingered . Suddenly free of the need to explain himself , he was reluctant to leave Mrs. Nash . Her face called to mind Mrs. Guerrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd just heard it for the first time . " Do n't you know of any rooms that are opening up around here ? " <p> " Uh-uh . All been sold . They trying to get me out , too . Well , sometimes there a few over on Columbus and Warren . Transient types . " <p> " Where are those ? " <p> She gave confused directions . He did n't ask her to repeat them , but thanked her and walked back down to the street . He was sorry to be alone again . By now a rain was falling in the dark . Not the wild downpour the wind and thunder had seemed to promise , but a warm steady shower . He wandered in it for a few blocks , his hair and shirt soaked and matted , until the dampness of his skin and clothes reminded him of the pressure at his abdomen . <p> He crossed Columbus Avenue . At the corner stood a Baptist church , and behind the church an alley sloped downward . The street sign said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprisingly overgrown lot , almost forest , the opposing backyards of two blocks of townhouses . On one green fence the words " Do Not Put Your Rubbish Here " had been painted , and directly under lay a heap of garbage . Against an oak tree Frisch began to urinate . Lights were on in some of the buildings , and he tried to conceal himself behind the trunk . Somehow it seemed better that it was raining , for he could hardly hear his own stream in the mingled rain , and the foamy puddle was quickly washed away . With the release he gave a sigh and looked up . He blinked . <p> In the darkness thirty feet away a sign in a window said " Rooms . " <p> In his haste to zip up he slightly wetted himself . He jogged to the gate and opened it and reached a low back door . There was no light . He knocked , then began to pound with the heel of his fist . He heard footsteps inside but no one came . He pounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the footsteps grew louder , and then the door was jerked open and a face appeared , white , a young man 's , his age-but acne-scarred and unshaven , bleary-eyed , distorted with anger . <p> " What do you want ? " <p> " Rooms for rent . " <p> " In the middle of the night ? In the goddamn rain ? " <p> " Do you have rooms in there ? " <p> Frisch peered behind the man  --  only darkness . <p> " Look , pal , come back tomorrow . Yeah , we got rooms , tomorrow , not tonight . You woke up the house . " <p> " No . Tonight . Now . " <p> " Who the hell are you , the mayor ? Read my lips . Somebody just moved out , it 's not cleaned up yet . " <p> " Tomorrow it 'll be gone . You accept women here ? " <p> The man sighed ostentatiously , then belched . " There 's a few . " <p> " Children ? " <p> " What , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for the woman . But I 'll sign for her . " <p> " Oh , you will , huh ? " Suddenly the man 's face curled into a sneer . " What are you , her pimp ? Hey , this ai n't the Ritz but it 's a respectable place . You ca n't just barge in here and say you want it for someone else . She some kind of whore ? " <p> Frisch smiled . He said , firmly , " The apartment is for me , too . She 's my wife . " <p> " Oh , for Christ 's sake . Why did n't you say so ? " The man closed his eyes and winced and opened them . He tried to hold Frisch in focus . " Are you her husband or are n't you ? " <p> " I am , " Frisch said . " Dammit , I am ! " <p> But when the rooms had been shown and the paper was given him to sign , Frisch hesitated , clutching the pen . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just get nervous with paperwork . " <p> He signed . The door closed behind him amid muttered curses , and Frisch found himself back out in the rain . He thought he should call Mrs. Guerrier . A pay phone stood under a streetlight and he reached in his pocket for a dime . Remembering " epluribus unum , " he smiled . In fact he had n't stopped smiling , even though he was soaked and exhausted in his bones , and the place after all was not the Ritz , end tomorrow was another day of work , end he 'd been made to seem what he was not . For a swell of feeling had taken Frisch far beyond himself , into this bond he no more expected than the task he 'd been given . But he also knew it to be temporary and ludicrous as signing , as lying . He would walk across the river home and tell her later , because he did n't want to be free just yet . <p> <p> By George Packer <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
