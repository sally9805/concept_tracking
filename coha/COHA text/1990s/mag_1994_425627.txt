<p> Among South American nations , Colombia has some of the earliest evidence of human settlement  --  stone flakes from the El Abra rock shelter and a mastodon-butchering site at Tibito , near Bogota , dating back 12,500 and 11,750 years respectively  --  as well as the continent 's most complete colonial population records . It seems only fitting , then , that the country should also be home to Profamilia , the hemisphere 's leading private organization concerned with population issues . In Colombia , where demographic matters are debated in the most open and practical terms , credit for this , as well as for the rapid decline in population growth , the great concern for women 's health , and the key role in national development played by family planning services , are due to the efforts of this nonprofit group , the Association for the Well-being of the Colombian Family ( Asociacion Pro-Bienestar de la Familia Colombiana ) , known by its Spanish acronym , Profamilia . <p> The Colombian population growth rate has been on a roller-coaster ride since before the Spanish conquest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across which came South America 's first human settlers , Colombia was the site of the first significant population centers . But after European arrival , and owing to disease , slavery , and warfare , the area 's roughly one hundred native chiefdoms declined rapidly from their total population size at contact , estimated by eminent Colombian historian German Colmenares at as high as 3 million . One of the higher estimates for South America 's population in 1492 is 49 million , and double that figure for the Western Hemisphere . <p> The technical problem of colonial population estimates has been solved in Colombia because of its nearly complete records of tributaries , or native male heads of household obliged to pay tribute to the Crown . By multiplying the number of tributaries by an average household size , the native population can be estimated . Where these records exist in periodic intervals , the drop-off in numbers is staggering . <p> For example , Tunja Province , some sixty miles northeast of Bogota , is unique in having complete censuses , not just tributary counts , which allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The population in 1564 stood at 168,440 , by 1636 fell to 44,691 , and in 1755 reached a low of 24,950 . Working backwards and assuming a smooth rate of decrease , the population in 1537 , the year of Tunja 's conquest , would have been near 283,000 , meaning the population had dropped by more than 90 percent in just two hundred years . <p> Evidence of population drop-off is also found in Colombian architecture . Francis-can churchs in the early colonial period had open air chapels to accommodate overflow Indian congregations , but by the end of the sixteenth century they were built smaller and fully enclosed , not because Indians stopped going to church , but rather because their numbers had been so greatly decimated . <p> The cause of population decline was not only a high death rate but also a reduced birthrate . The average number of children born to native mothers shrank abruptly during the colonial period . One census from the early seventeenth century showed about half the Indian couples surveyed had no children , while the average number was only two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are not necessarily valid across regions , the best guess for highland Peru was around six children per mother . Bartolome de Las Casas reported women in Hispan-iola having five children each . <p> By the early eighteenth century , as epidemics ebbed and social stability increased , Colombia 's population started making a slow rebound . In 1770 , the year of the nation 's first official census , the total figure stood at 806,209 , including significant mestizo and Spanish segments in addition to the indigenous population . The total number did not regain the 3 million mark  --  the estimated population at contact  --  until 1869 . Later censuses show the population building momentum  --  8.7 million in 1938 , 11.5 million in 1951 , and about 35 million today . <p> Gynecologist Fernando Tamayo founded Profamilia in 1965 , when the Colombian population stood at 18 million , and its 3.4 percent annual growth rate was fast enough to double that number roughly every twenty years . These were just numbers to Tamayo , however , who saw the problem more acutely in the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could afford to care for multiple pregnancies and babies , their own health requirements , and their family planning needs . Poorer women could not , and he found them and their children suffering terribly for it . <p> The price children paid was most clearly seen in their country 's high infant mortality rate  --  in 1968 , one hundred infant deaths per one thousand live births  --  a health indicator linked to the frequency of pregnancies and the early age of first-time mothers . The price paid by women , measured by the maternal mortality rate  --  three hundred childbirth-related deaths per one hundred thousand births in the same year  --  was also dramatic . <p> These death rates could be reduced , Tamayo argued , by offering family planning services to all women throughout the country . Since Profamilia 's founding in Tamayo 's modest private office , the organization has grown to operate forty-eight clinics , eleven thousand contraceptive supply posts , six women 's legal aid offices , eight men 's centers , fifteen teen centers , and AIDS education programs in key cities . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has fallen by three-quarters and the maternal mortality rate by nearly half . <p> Profamilia quickly grew to be a beacon for family planning services regionally and internationally . Joining the International Planned Parenthood Federation ( IPPF ) in 1967 , Profamilia won the United Nations Popula-tion Award in 1988 and the IPPF Outstand-ing Service Delivery Award in 1992 . <p> Says Dr. Hernan Sanhueza , regional director of IPPF/Western Hemisphere Region , " Profamilia is one of the world 's family planning leaders , initiating activities which others said could never be done in Latin America while seeking to provide the best quality care in the most effective way . The fact that so many family planners have adapted ideas and techniques pioneered by Profamilia is apt tribute . " <p> Profamilia-sponsored clinical and management research is published in leading medical journals , and its Bogota training center instructs students from Africa , Asia , and the rest of Latin America . Profamilia has recorded many " firsts " that have become the staples of family planning worldwide  --  for example , community-based contraceptives distribution ; using neighborhood volunteers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing ; and mass media radio advertising . <p> Profamilia naturally counts its greatest success in terms of family planning , and now serves about 60 percent of the country 's couples using contraceptives . This has led to a dramatic fall in the average number of children born to each woman  --  from 7.0 to 2.7 in just thirty years . Likewise , the overall birthrate has undergone one of the world 's fastest declines , to the point that Colombia 's population in the year 2000 will be well under 40 million , whereas before Profamilia started its work the millennial projection was for 56 million . <p> The figure for contraceptive prevalence makes Profamilia 's success even clearer . In the last thirty years , the percentage of married women practicing family planning has grown from 10 percent to 66 percent . Even with this achievement , Profamilia considers its job far from finished  --  an opinion they base on the hard evidence of a 1990 survey . <p> Eighty percent of married women said they either wanted to have no more children or to wait . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent said they had not wished to have gotten pregnant when they did , amounting to some 300,000 unwanted or mistimed pregnancies each of those years . <p> While family planning is often misidentified with birth control , Profamilia 's philosophy is to serve the full scope of women 's and family health . Dr. German Mora , an expert on maternal and child health with the Pan-American Health Organization , agrees with Profamilia 's focus on total health care . " Since few poor women can afford the time or money to seek care , " he says , " a clinic visit for whatever reason is literally a unique opportunity to attend to all her needs . " <p> Statistics from Profamilia 's clinical practice stand up admirably for this belief . In 1993 it recorded 362,531 clinic visits for contraceptive services and 608,590 clinic visits for general medicine , gynocological , or prenatal care , including 18,000 visits to treat infertility . <p> Under the guidance of the deputy executive director , Maria Isabel Plata , Profamilia has widened its arena from the clinic to the courtroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs of malnutrition and domestic violence , " explains Plata . " We see family planning as just one aspect of human life and character  --  and we hope to help the entire person . " Staff lawyers now help women in court to ask for alimony , separation orders , and inheritance decrees . Colombia 's laws are quite progressive in this regard , notes Plata , but access to legal assistance is still difficult for poor women . <p> Profamilia 's initial success depended upon gaining the quick attention and respect of the elite , so the first board of directors  --  composed of leading doctors , demographers , and opinion leaders  --  was chosen with this in mind . According to Profamilia 's executive director , Dr. Miguel Trias , the government offered its unofficial vote of confidence by simply allowing Profamilia to launch its family-planning initiatives . <p> " Few politicians specifically advocate family planning rights , " Trias says . " Instead , they speak of womens rights , which is code language for reproductive freedom . This means that substantial progress can be made through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make up their minds . " In recent years officials have gone beyond neutrality , by signing contracts with Profamilia to provide statesubsidized care in areas without adequate government services . <p> Successive Colombian governments have not shied from addressing population issues head-on . In 1968 , President Carlos Lleras Restrepo became the only Latin American head of state to be an original signatory to the United Nations Declaration on Population . In 1969 , family planning services became available in government clinics , and in 1970 President Misael Pastrana Borrero composed a National Population Council of private , public , and church representatives to advise on policy questions . <p> In recent years Profamilia has assumed a higher profile role as government adviser . At the request of outgoing Colombian president Cesar Gaviria ( and new OAS secretary general ) , the organization wrote last year 's official compliance report required under the international Convention to Eliminate All Forms of Discrimination Against Women , and in 1991 helped draft the new constitution 's clause guaranteeing family planning as a human right . <p> Profamilia 's relations with the Catholic church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Profamilia 's founding principles , but more influenced perhaps by the liberalism of the Second Vatican Council , in 1969 the Plenary Assembly of the Colombian Episcopate softened its stance on family planning from outright opposition to sympathetic openness . <p> Surprisingly , this followed on the heels of the papal encyclical Humanae Vitae , implicitly condemning artificial contraception , which had been issued only days before Pope Paul VI 's visit to Colombia . This was remembered as a difficult time for family planning worldwide , but nothing however to compare with the crisis of 1984 , during which Cardinal Alfonso Lopez Trujillo attacked Profamilia for its internationally financed surgical contraception services . <p> While the debate centered as much on issues of national sovereignty as on Catholic teaching , former president Restrepo , the National Academy of Medicine , and leading mass media commentators supported Profamilia , guaranteeing a healthy airing of the issues  --  specifically the link between individual rights , socioeconomic equity , and family planning . <p> The critique of family planning in Latin America comes not only from the Catholic church but also from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs focused narrowly on contraception  --  what some call the " population-centered approach "  --  are seen as unfair to women and the poor in general , asking them alone to reduce their fertility as a means of absolving men and the upper classes of their common responsibility to alleviate poverty , ensure health for all , and control pollution . <p> This feminist philosophy is emerging as the United Nations International Conference of Population and Develop-ment is taking place this September in Cairo . Colombian journalist Patricia Ardila has bluntly criticized developed countries ' " single issue mentality " when it comes to advocating family planning for the rest of the world . " By failing to tackle severe disadvantages affecting women , " she has written , " the populationcentered approach has led to using women as mere instruments for attaining fertility decline . " <p> As the population summit convenes , it remains to be seen what the locus of attention will be : Will demographers question the official goal of stabilizing world population at 7.2 billion people by the year 2050 ? Will feminists insist on guaranteeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family-planning model ? Or will religious groups make a claim for the more ethereal concepts of family unity and social justice ? <p> As Executive Director Trias says , Profamilia prefers offering practical solutions over debating contrary philosophies . But by its own mandate , which includes legal aid to women , AIDS education , and national advocacy for reproductive rights , Profamilia has proven family planning to be a broad , multifaceted approach to modern life . Just as Colombian society is changing , so Profamilia will continue to evolve in order to address the ever-shifting needs of Colombian women and their families . <p> PHOTO : A scene of a crowded street in Colombia <p> PHOTO : This clinic in Neiva , 150 miles southwest of Bogota , is among the forty-eight family-planning clinics that Profamilia has founded throughout the country . <p> PHOTO : Dt .
