MOVIES <P> BLACK ROBE . Sometimes you dance with the wolf ; sometimes the wolf eats you . Bruce Beresford 's dark drama , about a white priest among some truly savage savages , tops Kevin Costner 's Oscar-winning 1990 romance by being anthropologically , if not politically , correct . It embraces ambiguity and is all the more powerful for it . <P> FOR THE BOYS . The definitive Bette Midler movie  --  all music , sass and high emoting  --  is also a jazzy panorama of pop culture for half an American century . And even if you skip the movie , get the sound track , which features Bette 's great and knowing pipes on excavated swing tunes like Billy-a-Dick and Stuff Like That There . <P> MEETING VENUS . A Hungarian guest conductor ( Niels Arestrup ) meets a Swedish diva ( Glenn Close ) while rehearsing Wagner 's Tannhauser with a motley and disputatious band of emigre musicians in Paris . Result : a funny , satirical , romantic and  --  above all  --  intelligent film about backstage intrigues and onstage triumphs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Casey went on to write better plays and the new Irish troupe that bears his name may go on to better stagings , but both show to advantage in this tragicomedy about the Troubles in Dublin of 1920 . The touring show , directed by the playwright 's daughter Shivaun , is at Washington 's Kennedy Center until Jan. 19 . <P> NICK &; NORA . Remember that lovable Asta ? Well , the only new American musical of the 1991-92 Broadway season , based on the Thin Man movies , is quite a dog itself . <P> MARVIN 'S ROOM . The first generation of AIDS plays dealt with the disease head on and focused on a specifically gay male world . The new wave , like Prelude to a Kiss and this off-Broadway knockout by Scott McPherson , respond metaphorically , never mentioning gays or even the disease but instead looking at the universal experiences of illness and dying , family rage and reconciliation . Director David Petrarca has polished the work through stagings in Chicago and Hartford , and it shines  --  especially in Laura Esterman 's portrayal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her turbulent teenage nephew . <P> TELEVISION <P> CIRQUE DU SOLEIL II ( HBO , Dec. 17 , 21 ) . Montreal 's fantastical theatrical circus troupe presents an all-new show , spotlighting a bewitching company of aerialists , acrobats , contortionists and clowns . <P> AMAZING GRACE ( PBS , Dec. 20 , 9 p.m. on most stations ) . A welcome rerun of Bill Moyers ' glorious documentary on the meaning and legacy of one of the most popular hymns in the English language . Jessye Norman , Judy Collins and the Boys Choir of Harlem are among the singers . <P> TWO ROOMS : TRIBUTE TO ELTON JOHN &; BERNIE TAUPIN ( ABC , Dec. 21 , 9 p.m . EST ) . Rocket Man , Bennie and the Jets , Crocodile Rock and lots more John-Taupin hits are performed by Tina Turner , Sting , the Who , Elton himself and a galaxy of other rock stars in this salute to the two-decade career of the hugely successful songwriting team . <P> MUSIC <P> MARC COHN : MARC COHN ( Atlantic ) . Nimble songwriting and heartfelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the halcyon days of James Taylor and Jackson Browne . Taylor , in fact , joins in on one tune , but on tracks like the streamlined Silver Thunderbird and Walking in Memphis , Cohn shows off a style that 's clearly all his own .
