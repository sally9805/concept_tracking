Somewhere between the heavenly promise of America and the hellish reality of Haiti lies a way station on the Cuban coast called Guantanamo Bay . There , at a U.S. naval base , more than 200 Haitians have languished in tin-roofed barracks for up to 17 months , surrounded by wire fences and plagued by banana rats . Last year the Bush Administration ruled that they had plausible claims for political asylum . But because most of them tested positive for the AIDS virus , they are barred from the U.S. Suspicious of their captors and even their doctors , many have staged a hunger strike , and their situation has now become critical . " The next few days will determine whether or not the Haitians live or die , " says attorney Michael Ratner . <P> The Haitian refugees are the most visible symbol of what may be the next unnecessary controversy to distract the Clinton Administration from its attempt to focus on economic issues . Last week the President announced plans to lift the ban that prevents foreigners with the AIDS virus from immigrating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the change on the grounds that the virus is not easily transmitted . " This should n't be a hot-button issue , especially when you consider the lack of a public health threat , " says Dr. June Osborn , chairman of the National Commission on AIDS . But opponents believe the plan could be both dangerous and costly .

The National Commission on AIDS estimates that as a result between 300 and 600 people with AIDS or infected with HIV might immigrate into the country every year . <P> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control a disease within your borders , " insists Republican Representative Tom DeLay of Texas . He is worried that the tab for infected Haitian refugees and other immigrants could land in the taxpayers ' lap . According to the government 's own estimate , the cost of treating the average AIDS patient from diagnosis to death is $100,000 . " Our medical care , social-services net and free public education are a magnet for immigrants , " argues Dan Stein , executive director of the Federation for American Immigration Reform , a conservative lobbying group in Washington . " We ca n't bring people here en masse for medical treatment . " <P> Refugees and immigrants are n't the only groups that would be affected . In 1990 many non-American members of the World Federation of Hemophilia could not attend their annual convention , which was held in Washington , because they carry the AIDS virus . Ironically , most of them had been infected by American blood products exported to their countries . Under current rules , even a child dying of AIDS could be barred from crossing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disneyland in France , " DeLay says . " You 've got to be hard in situations like this .
