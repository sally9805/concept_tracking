<p> In his column ( Oct. 19 ) concerning the Illinois State Police drone car program on the tollway system , Dan Rozek somehow manages to characterize a successful , cost-effective program as unsuccessful  --  despite ample evidence to the contrary . In the crash-prone areas where drone cars are utilized : <p> Injury-causing crashes are down 7.5 percent . <p> Average speeds , which vary on a daily basis , are down an average of 8 percent . <p> This is at an annual cost of between $ 25,000 and $ 30,000 . <p> Despite these statistics and his own observation that 15 percent of drivers slow down when they pass a drone car , Rozek argues that the seasonal suspension of the program should consider a " permanent retirement . " It 's unlikely that the drivers and passengers who would have been involved in the 42 injury-causing crashes that did n't occur in drone program areas in 1996 would agree . <p> The drone concept was initiated two years ego to impact unsafe driving on the tollways on a cost-effective basis . The program has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure satisfactory performance . If performance in 1997 is acceptable , the program will be renewed in 1998 , with changes to add elements of surprise , which will make it less predictable . <p> The drone car program operates as a supplement to the Illinois State Police tollway patrol force , which provides assistance to 40,000 motorists and issues 30,000 speeding citations each year . We believe that continuing changes and enhancements will enable the drone program to continue as a cost-effective component of safety assurance . <p> Gregory F. Fritz , <p> commander , District 15 , <p> Illinois State Police , <p> Downers Grove <p> New-look TIFs <p> The Civic Federation commends Mayor Daley for enacting significant Tax Increment Financing disclosure and financial reporting reforms by executive order ( news story , Oct. 28 ) , reforms advocated by the Civic Federation , the Metropolitan Planning Council and others . TIF is perhaps Chicago 's most important economic development tool , using millions of dollars in property tax revenues to fund needed improvements . <p> However , until the mayor 's order was issued , detailed planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to the general public . There simply was no easy way for taxpayers to effectively scrutinize or analyze the use of public funds on various TIF projects . <p> The mayor 's executive order makes it possible for taxpayers to have access to timely and accurate TIF information . In our estimation , these reforms go a long way toward substantially improving public confidence in the city 's TIF program . The executive order also demonstrates the mayor 's strong commitment to working with civic groups like the Civic Federation to address the city 's problems . <p> Lance Pressl , president , <p> Roland Calia , <p> director of research , <p> Civic Federation , Loop <p> Make CTA shine <p> I wish to add to your list of ways to attract new customers to mass transit ( editorial , Oct. 16 ) , particularly to the CTA . <p> CTA rapid transit stations must be kept clean . With each station assigned a full-time janitor , it is appalling to find stations filled with grime , litter , gum wads , graffiti that lingers for days and urine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsafe . High-pressure cleaning and sweeping should be a daily routine , the way it is at Daley Plaza and other public spaces . <p> On-train personnel need to be trained to make announcements in a clear , uniform and professional manner . While some are excellent , too many make announcements that are either unintelligible , archaic ( " This is a northbound Douglas B-train " instead of " the Blue Line to O'Hare " ) or unprofessional ( angrily scolding , " let ' em off ! " to passengers standing on the platform , in an attempt to clear a path for passengers exiting the train ) . Worse are those who offer no explanation while a train stands still between stations . <p> Ticket agents ( now re-designated " customer service assistants " ) , motormen and bus operators need to be more friendly and welcoming , not indifferent . The CTA can learn from retail and fast-food chains that compete by displaying an attitude that appreciates the customer . <p> City officials must stop assuming that declines in CTA services and ridership are inevitable . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reversed . It is n't that long ago that the prevailing mentality was that all middle-class Chicagoans aspired to flee to the suburbs . Yet , by shoring up the city 's infrastructure , Mayor Daley managed to dispel that notion , and Chicago is now basking in an unprecedented new residential construction and loft conversion boom . <p> Daley and new CTA President Frank Kruesi need to focus on the mass transit crisis as the city 's next impossible dream . To suggest that mass transit has " lost its constituency " or has become " irrelevant " sends a message that Chicago is willing to settle for transportation gridlock . <p> With record numbers of people moving back into the city , the already difficult levels of local roadway congestion and wear will only escalate . A more efficient mass transit alternative  --  i.e. , a CTA that shines  --  can significantly ease that congestion and wear , putting yet another feather in Chicago 's expanding cap of city life perks . <p> Benjamin E.

" <p> This excerpt from Yeager by Chuck Yeager and Leo Janos epitomizes the life of the retired U.S. Air Force general , who on Oct. 14 , 1947 , became the first person to successfully fly an aircraft faster than the speed of sound . The event is considered by many to be the greatest aviation achievement since the Wright brothers ' first flight . <p> Fifty years to the date later , the self-effacing Yeager re-created his history-making flight by flying once again at the speed of sound over the southern California desert . He then announced he was giving up military flying . <p> Yeager , 74 , will live forever in the history books as the first man to break the sound barrier in an airplane . But he also should be remembered as a courageous test pilot and World War II flying ace who dedicated his life in service to his country .

When malnourished people do not follow their prescribed diets , do we blame their nutritionists ? When students do n't do their assignments , do we blame the teachers ? <p> Why not ? We ca n't have the students or their parents take responsibility for themselves , can we ? They demand that the schools fix the malnourished students .
