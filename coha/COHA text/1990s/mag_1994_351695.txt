In the year 1414 Zheng He , Grand Eunuch of the Three Treasures , loaded some exotic creatures onto his junk and headed back to China from the coast of East Africa . One , the long-necked K'i-lin , astounded Emperor Yu and his court . It was unlike anything they had ever seen , with its " luminous spots like a red cloud or purple mist . " The K'i-lin was poked , prodded , observed from every angle , much commented upon but little understood . <P> The World Cup is not unlike the K'i-lin . It 's been the greatest thing to hit America since the invasion of the Beatles . It 's the worst thing to come to America since the onslaught of the killer bees . It is subtle , riveting drama . It is a repetitive , soporific bore . One scribe based in Washington has even described it as a metaphor for the Clinton health-care plan : all process , no results . Makes you wonder what he 'd write the first time he saw a giraffe . <P> When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be full of enthusiasts even if , as expected , fewer than 3% of the nation 's TV sets are tuned in . When the victors and losers jet home next week to their respective adulation and opprobrium , America will be left with baseball , football training camps , a little tennis , a smattering of golf  --  and a void . For those who gave it a chance , the World Cup turned out to be a refreshing breather from the standard summer fare . Nothing against harness racing or the fellows who drive steroid-injected cars in circles , mind you . But out on the football pitch , as the newly initiated call the soccer field , there has been high drama : Italy 's improbable comeback against underdog Nigeria left supporters of both teams drained . Off the field there has been tragedy : the execution of Colombian Andres Escobar shamed the nation whose colors he had proudly worn . There have been oddities : referees were sent home ignominiously for merely blowing a call . Huh ? Officials make mistakes every day . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the game was difficult for Americans to capture . We 're used to players carrying a ball toward pay dirt or jamming one down through the basket . All results , minimal process . <P> The essence of soccer is more elusive , although the objective of scoring one more goal than the other guys is easy to understand . Occasionally the best strategy to score may require players to move the ball away from the opponents ' goal , as the Germans often would do . Other times the strategy is not to score at all . A tie can be like kissing Julia Roberts , as the Americans discovered in their 1-1 match with Switzerland in the opening round , which helped them advance to the second . Sometimes strategy defies rational analysis . " God was a Bulgarian today , " said Hristo Stoichkov of his country 's unlikely victory over Mexico . " It does n't matter how we won . " <P> Come next Super Bowl , most Americans will not remember the name of the Brazilian player who elbowed American star Tab Ramos in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concussion . ( For future bar bets , it 's Leonardo . ) But they will remember that Bebeto 's and Romario 's skills with a soccer ball rival the gifts Michael Jordan brought to basketball . The ball did everything they told it to do .
