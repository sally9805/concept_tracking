The Great American Budget Battle , Washington 's answer to professional wrestling , has officially begun , all roars and growls and theatrical blows to the head . This week Congress will send the President a $792 billion tax-cut bill ; he has promised to stomp on it . Clinton has pushed a $300 billion spending program , including a new prescription-drug program for Medicare ; congressional fists are already clenched . There is talk of grand ideological warfare , of reckless spendthrift Democrats and reckless plutocrat-loving Republicans fighting over how to divvy up the glorious $3 trillion surplus . In this season 's budget politics , much of the fight is phony . But that does n't mean no one 's going to get hurt . <P> The nastiest battles , where real blood may spill , are occurring in the committees of Congress that have to pass 13 spending bills by the end of the month to keep the government running . So far , only two have been sent to Clinton to sign ; he has threatened to veto others if they gouge spending too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected over the next 10 years , why would lawmakers be forced to gut programs like air-traffic control and food inspection and counterterrorism ? Because two years ago , they promised they would . The problem is the famous 1997 Balanced Budget Act , which balanced the budget only because Congress and the President agreed to cut the total amount of discretionary spending in future years , without having to say exactly what would be cut . Congress , like Wimpy , will gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today . <P> Well , the future is now , and the caps are giving everyone a blinding headache . If military spending merely keeps up with inflation , then every other government program will have to be cut 20% in the next two years . This would require , for instance , slicing $16 billion this year from the huge , $315 billion bill that covers health and education . Increasing Pentagon outlays , as both sides have promised to do , could require 50% cuts elsewhere . That 's not going to happen . But the minute the lawmakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's because when the bean counters counted the beans and predicted there would be an extra $1 trillion in 10 years , not counting Social Security revenues , it was assumed that lawmakers would obey the laws they had written and slash future spending by billions of dollars . If lawmakers bail , then there 's less extra money to pay down the debt . Republican proposals so far , rather than cutting spending , would increase it next year about $25 billion , which more than wipes out next year 's projected $14 billion surplus . The only place to find that money is to raise taxes ( the White House still loves a tobacco tax ) or raid Social Security , as lawmakers have routinely done for years . <P> But this time around , both sides have promised not to touch the Social Security surplus , which will run about $147 billion next year . Republican leaders do n't want to take the blame for scooping out an extra $14 billion just to keep the government running  --  especially after conservatives got so angry with them when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if spending means so much to him , the President will have to justify dipping into the Social Security trust fund , " says John Czwartacki , spokesman for Senate majority leader Trent Lott .
