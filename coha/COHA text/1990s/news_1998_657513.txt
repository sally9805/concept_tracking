<p> Minneapolis architect Sarah Susanka had just finished speaking at a local home and garden show , emphasizing that bigger is not always better in housing design . A couple in the audience came up to her , and the wife , her eyes brimming with tears , told a sad story . " We just built a $ 500,000 house , but we ca n't bear to live there , " she said . " All we 've got is square footage with no soul . It 's too big . " " Too big " is a lament Ms. Susanka hears more often these days as new homes increase in size . Owners , saddled with impersonal , cavernous spaces , sometimes wonder what went wrong - why they feel so profoundly disaffected from the very place that is supposed to nurture and satisfy : home . " People are deeply , deeply unhappy with what society is offering up in housing , " Susanka explains . " Our lifestyles have metamorphosed , but houses have n't changed . I ca n't tell you the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . ' " These showplaces , sometimes dubbed trophy houses or McMansions , illustrate what Susanka calls a " Versailles complex - the notion that houses should be designed to impress rather than nurture . " Many feature vaulted ceilings , Palladian windows , walls of glass , and separate rooms for single activities - media rooms , exercise rooms , hobby rooms , art studios , yoga rooms . Susanka emphasizes that she is not advocating a small house , but rather , as she puts it , a not-so-big house . " People are almost desperate for a sense of home , " she explains . " We 're using quantity to find home , but home is n't anything to do with bigness . Spaciousness just is n't conducive to comfort . In these humongous houses , people are living in the smallest space where they can find a little shelter . They 're living in the kitchen , and other spaces are atrophying . " Susanka suggests eliminating rarely used spaces such as formal living rooms ( " almost a memorial to the way we used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaurs " ) . She replaces them with adaptable spaces , designed to be used every day . These include multipurpose eating areas , alcoves for reading or working at home , and window seats . Ceilings of varying heights help to define space , as do lighting systems that enable family members to " set the scene " for different occasions . Much of the quest for more space , Susanka finds , stems from a desire to get away from the noise of television . One solution involves creating an acoustically private " away room . " By favoring quality of design over quantity of space , homeowners can spend more on beautifying a home rather than simply making it bigger . What really defines the character of a house , Susanka points out , are the details : a beautiful stair railing , well-crafted moldings around windows and doors , and useful , finely tailored built-ins . Another important element in any home is privacy . " Adults want spaces to be alone , " Susanka says . " It 's an unacknowledged need , but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the life we live as a couple . Even if it 's just a tiny space , each of us needs a place . People are looking for cozy . " During an interview in Cambridge , Mass. , where she was lecturing to architects at the Harvard Graduate School of Design , Susanka , a principal with Mulfinger , Susanka , Mahady and Partners in Minneapolis , describes the " fictions " many homes are built around . " We do n't live as formally as we think we will , " she says . " Even those times we think we need formal dining , we do n't . " Her own house , which she and her architect husband , Jim Larson , designed , illustrates the point . Although they have no formal dining room , they can seat 27 for Thanksgiving dinner in an open eating area adjacent to the kitchen . Another myth centers around homeowners ' desire for many bathrooms . " In a high-end house , someone will say , ' We really need two powder rooms , one for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests . ' " Yet this " bathroom proliferation , " she warns , often wastes space and money . Beyond obvious benefits of comfort , not-so-big houses offer important environmental advantages by consuming less energy . " We 're using so much of our resources in these humongous houses , " Susanka observes . " Is n't there a better way to use our resources ? Make every tree that goes into the building of a house really enhance the life that it 's enclosing . " Sharing that philosophy are Greg Britz and Elizabeth Brown of Hillsborough , N.C. Last month the couple and their three young children moved from a 2,600-square-foot , five-bedroom house to a smaller home . They plan to build a 1-1/2-story house with 2,000 square feet . After beginning with passive solar power , they will eventually convert to active solar . " We want something that 's much more energy-efficient , " Ms. Brown says . Describing the house they sold , she adds , " It 's beautiful , but it 's just too much . We had two bedrooms we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wonderful as a playroom . And we had a huge living room that was beautiful , but we never used it . " Still , Brown finds the bigger-is-better mentality deeply entrenched . " I have friends in the neighborhood who are just scraping by to pay their mortgage , but they would n't consider scaling down , " she says . Homeowners seeking more practical floor plans also find themselves thwarted by a housing industry that insists on preserving outmoded spaces . Real estate brokers , appraisers , and bankers , Susanka says , perpetuate the notion that a house needs a formal living room and dining room for resale . She speaks boldly about the need for big changes and " a revolution " in the industry . " When about 80 percent of your clients come in the door and say , ' We live informally , but we need a living room and dining room for resale , ' you realize the tail is wagging the dog . " To encourage change and offer ideas , Susanka has written " The Not So Big House : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be published in October by Taunton Press . Her firm has also been selected to design the next Life magazine Dream House . " It 's incumbent on architects to explain how to think about home , " Susanka insists . Georgia Bizios , a professor of architecture at North Carolina State University in Chapel Hill , and a practicing architect , finds that some architects in her area are seeing an increase in residential clients . " Many consumers look around , and what they see are large , badly built houses that do n't fit the site , " she explains . " They are coming to architects saying , ' I do n't want one of those . I want a better house . ' " For a while , Professor Bizios says , people welcomed very large houses . " Space was seen as a luxury . Now they realize that just having additional square footage is not all there is to it . " Beth and Michael Hoffman of Minnetonka , Minn. , both real estate brokers , know the rewards of carefully planned space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , creates an informal environment where their blended family can gather . " The house is not big , but it does n't feel confined , " Mr. Hoffman says of the 2,500-square-foot structure . " The whole back of the home is the kitchen and dining area , and then you step down to the family room , which is the main living area . " Stepping down creates a visual separation . It also gives the illusion of a high ceiling . In working with real estate clients , Hoffman says , " I see people who think big is better , but it is n't . My home has to be a sanctuary for me . " Susanka echoes that sentiment as she talks about the importance of " achieving a sanctuary that nurtures and simplifies our lives . " Her happiest clients , she finds , are those who spend money on quality , emphasizing comfort , usefulness , beauty , and craftsmanship . " If people start putting dollars into personalizing the house , they 'll move less , and they 'll have a fabulous house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contentment brings obvious rewards . " We 've got so much change happening around us , and our life is so frenetic , " Susanka says . " Our house is the still part , the place where you have serenity and calm . Its importance has actually increased . " <p> HOW TO STRETCH THE SPACE YOU HAVE Sarah Susanka suggests these architectural features to help make the best use of space and provide maximum comfort in a house : * The public kitchen . Because the kitchen has become the heart of a house , make it accessible and open to all the living areas . Once it is connected - physically and visually - to these spaces , the need for a separate family room , sunroom , and living room is gone . * Also consider adding a hearth and a small cozy area where a few people can gather out of the traffic pattern of food preparation . * Double-duty dining . Instead of a formal dining room and an informal eating area in the kitchen , create one place that can serve for everyday use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formally . * Window seats . Raise the floor , lower the ceiling , and bring in the walls to define a cozy place for one or two people . * Circulation space . Do n't sacrifice square feet at the entry and in passageways . Generous circulation areas make a smaller house feel bigger . * Creative storage . Use nooks and crannies to maximize storage space . Make storage correspond to the place where the object is used . If you have a wonderful collection of something , use it as an exhibit - displaying plates on a plate rail , for example .
