It was dawn when she woke , the sky just beginning to brighten in the east , night 's shadows still draping the trunks and limbs of the big shade trees in inky layers . She lay quietly for a time , looking through her curtained window as the day advanced , aware of a gradual change in the light that warmed the cool darkness of her bedroom . From beneath the covers she listened to the sounds of the morning . She could hear birdsong in counterpoint to the fading hum of tires as a car sped down Woodlawn 's blacktop toward the highway . She could hear small creaks and mutterings from the old house , some of them so familiar that she remembered them from her childhood . She could hear the sound of voices , of Gran and Old Bob , whispering to each other in the kitchen as they drank their morning coffee and waited for her to come out for breakfast . But the voices were only in her mind , of course . Old Bob and Gran were gone . Nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long legs to her chest , rested her forehead against her knees , and closed her eyes . Gone . Both of them . Gran for five years and Old Bob since May . It was hard to believe , even now . She wished every day that she could have them back again . Even for five minutes . Even for five seconds . The sounds of the house wrapped her , small and comforting , all part of her nineteen years of life . She had always lived in this house , right up to the day she had left for college in September of last year , a freshman on a full ride at one of the most prestigious schools in the country . Northwestern University . Her grandfather had been so proud , telling her she should remember she had earned the right to attend this school , but the school , in turn , had merited her interest , so both of them should get something out of the bargain . He had laughed , his voice low and deep , his strong hands coming about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively that he was holding her for Gran , as well . Now he was gone , dead of a heart attack three days before the end of her first year , gone in a moment , the doctor said afterward -- no pain , no suffering , the way it should be . She had come to accept the doctor 's reassurance , but it did n't make her miss her grandfather any the less . With both Gran and Old Bob gone , and her parents gone longer still , she had only herself to rely upon . But , then , she supposed in a way that had always been so . She lifted her head and smiled . It was how she had grown up , was n't it ? Learning to be alone , to be independent , to accept that she would never be like any other child ? She ticked off the ways in which she was different , running through them in a familiar litany that helped define and settle the borders of her life . She could do magic -- had been able to do magic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , confused and troubled her , but she had learned to adapt to the magic 's demands , taught first by Gran , who had once had use of the magic herself , and later by Pick . She had learned to control and nurture it , to find a place for it in her life without letting it consume her . She had discovered how to maintain the balance within herself in the same way that Pick was always working to maintain the balance in the park . Pick , her best friend , was a six-inch-high sylvan , a forest creature who looked for the most part like something a child had made of the discards of a bird 's nest , with body and limbs of twigs and hair and beard of moss . Pick was the guardian of Sinnissippi Park , sent to keep in balance the magic that permeated all things and to hold in check the feeders that worked to upset that balance . It was a big job for a lone sylvan , as he was fond of saying , and over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nest was the latest . Perhaps she would be the last . There was her family , of course . Gran had possessed the magic , as had others of the Freemark women before her . Not Old Bob , who had struggled all his life to accept that the magic even existed . Maybe not her mother , who had died three months after Nest was born and whose life remained an enigma . But her father ... She shook her head at the walls . Her father . She did n't like to think of him , but he was a fact of her life , and there was enough time and distance between them now that she could accept what he had been . A demon . A monster . A seducer . The killer of both her mother and her grandmother . Dead now , destroyed by his own ambition and hate , by Gran 's magic and his own , by Nest 's determination , and by Wraith . Wraith . She looked out the window in the diminishing shadows and shivered . The ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ended with Wraith . She sighed and shook her head mockingly . Enough of that sort of rumination . She rose and walked into the bathroom , turned on the shower , let it run hot , and stepped in . She stood with her eyes closed and the water streaming over her , lost in the heat and the damp . She was nineteen and stood just under five feet ten inches . Her honey-colored hair was still short and curly , but most of her freckles were gone . Her green eyes dominated her smooth , round face . Her body was lean and fit . She was the best middle-distance runner ever to come out of the state of Illinois and one of the best in history . She did n't think about her talent much , but it was always there , in much the same way as her magic . She wondered often if her running ability was tied in some way to her use of the magic . There was no obvious connection and even Pick tended to brush the suggestion aside , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a full track-and-field scholarship . Her grades were good , but it was her athletic skills that got her in . She had won several middle-distance events at last spring 's NCAA track-and-field championships . She had already broken several college records and one world . In two years the summer Olympics would be held in Melbourne , Australia . Nest Freemark was expected to contend for a medal in multiple running events . She was expected to win at least one gold . She turned off the shower , stepped out onto the mat , grabbed a towel , and dried herself off . She tried not to think about the Olympics too often . It was too distant in time and too mind-boggling to consider . She had learned a hard lesson when she was fourteen and her father had revealed himself for what he was . Never take anything in your life for granted ; always be prepared for radical change . Besides , there were more pressing problems just now . There was school ; she had to earn grades high enough to allow her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was persistent and unending in his demand that she give more of her time and effort to helping him with the park -- which seemed silly until she listened to his reasoning . And , right at the moment , there was the matter of the house . She dressed slowly , thinking of the house , which was the reason she was home this weekend when her time would have been better spent at school , studying . With her grandfather 's death , the house and all of its possessions had passed to her . She had spent the summer going through it , room by room , closet by closet , cataloguing , boxing , packing , and sorting what would stay and go . It was her home , but she was barely there enough to look after it properly and , Pick 's entreaties notwithstanding , she had no real expectation of coming back after graduation to live . The realtors , sensing this , had already begun to descend . The house and lot were in a prime location . She could get a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be put to good use helping defray her training and competition expenses . The real estate market was strong just now , a seller 's market . Was n't this the right time to act ? She had received several offers over the summer , and this past week Allen Kruppert had called from ERA Realty to tender one so ridiculously high that she had agreed to consider it . She had come after classes on Friday , skipping track-and-field practice , so that she could meet with Allen on Saturday morning and look over the papers . Allen was a rotund , jovial young man , whom she had met on several occasions at church picnics , and he impressed her because he never tried to pressure her into anything where the house was concerned but seemed content just to present his offers and step back . The house was not listed , but if she was to make the decision to sell , she knew , she would almost certainly list it with him . The papers he had provided on this latest offer sat on the kitchen table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyer had already signed . The financing was in place . All that was needed was her signature and the deal was done . She put the papers aside and sat down to eat a bowl of cereal with her orange juice and coffee , her curly hair still damp against her face as golden light spread through the curtained windows and the sun rose over the trees . If she signed , her financial concerns for the immediate future would be over . Pick , of course , would have a heart attack . Which was not a good thing if you were already a hundred and fifty years old . She was just finishing the cereal when she heard a knock at the back door . She frowned ; it was only eight o'clock in the morning , not the time people usually came calling . Besides , no one ever used the back door , except ... She walked from the kitchen down the hall to the porch . A shadowy figure stood leaning into the screen , trying to peer inside . Could n't be , could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen door , she could already see it was . " Hey , Nest , " Robert Heppler said . He stood with his hands shoved deep into the pockets of his jeans and one tennis shoe bumping nervously against the worn threshold . " You going to invite me in or what ? " He gave her one of his patented cocky grins and tossed back the shoulder-length blond hair from his angular face . She shook her head . " I do n't know . What are you doing here , anyway ? " " You mean like , ' here at eight o'clock in the morning , ' or like , ' here in Hopewell as opposed to Palo Alto ' ? You 're wondering if I was tossed out of school , right ? " " Were you ? " " Naw . Stanford needs me to keep its grade point average high enough to attract similarly brilliant students . I was just in the neighborhood and decided to stop by , share a few laughs , maybe see if you 're in the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep up his confidence . He glanced past her toward the kitchen . " Do I smell coffee ? You 're alone , are n't you ? I mean , I 'm not interrupting anything , am I ? " " Jeez , Robert , you are such a load . " She sighed and stepped back . " Come on in . " She beckoned him to follow and led him down the hall . The screen door banged shut behind them and she winced , remembering how Gran had hated it when she did that . " So what are you really doing here ? " she pressed him , gesturing vaguely in the direction of the kitchen table as she reached for the coffeepot and a cup . The coffee steamed in the morning air as she poured it . He shrugged , giving her a furtive look . " I saw your car , knew you were home , thought I should say hello . I know it 's early , but I was afraid I might miss you . " She handed him the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained standing . " I 've been waiting to hear from you , " she said pointedly . " You know me , I do n't like to rush things . " He looked away quickly , unable to meet her steady gaze . He sipped gingerly from his cup , then made a face . " What is this stuff ? " Nest lost her patience . " Look , did you come here to insult me , or do you need something , or are you just lonely again ? " He gave her his hurt puppy look . " None of the above . " He glanced down at the real estate papers , which were sitting on the counter next to him , then looked up at her again . " I just wanted to see you . I did n't see you all summer , what with you off running over hill and dale and cinder track . " " Robert , do n't start ... " " Okay , I know , I know . But it 's true . I have n't seen you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault is that , do you think ? " He pushed his glasses further up on his nose and screwed up his mouth . " Okay , all right . It 's my fault . I have n't seen you because I knew how badly I messed up . " " You were a jerk , Robert . " He flinched as if struck . " I did n't mean anything . " " You did n't ? " A slow flush worked its way up her neck and into her cheeks . " My grandfather 's funeral service was barely finished and there you were , making a serious effort to grope me . I do n't know what that was all about , but I did n't appreciate it one bit . " He shook his head rapidly . " I was n't trying to grope you exactly . " " Yes , you were . Exactly . You might have done yourself some good , you know , if you 'd stuck around to apologize afterward instead of running off . " His laugh was forced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my head off . " She stared at him , waiting . She knew how he felt about her , how he had always felt about her . She knew this was difficult for him and she was n't making it any easier . But his misguided attempt at an intimate relationship was strictly one-sided and she had to put a stop to it now or whatever was left of their friendship would go right out the window . He took a deep breath . " I made a big mistake , and I 'm sorry . I guess I just thought you needed ... that you wanted someone to ... Well , I just was n't thinking , that 's all . " He pushed back his long hair nervously . " I 'm not so good at stuff like that , and you , well , you know how I feel ... " He stopped and looked down at his feet . " It was stupid . I 'm really sorry . " She did n't say anything , letting him dangle in the wind a little longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a minute , meeting her gaze squarely for the first time . " I do n't know what else to say , Nest . I 'm sorry . Are we still friends ? " Even though he had grown taller and gotten broader through the shoulders , she still saw him as being fourteen . There was a little-boy look and sound to him that she thought he might never entirely escape . " Are we ? " he pressed . She gave him a considering look . " Yes , Robert , we are . We always will be , I hope . But we 're just friends , okay ? Do n't try to make it into anything else . If you do , you 're just going to make me mad all over again . " He looked doubtful , but nodded anyway . " Okay . " He glanced down again at the real estate papers . " Are you going to sell the house ? " " Robert ! " " Well , that 's what it looks like . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business ! " Irritated at herself for being so abrupt , she added , " Look , I have n't decided anything yet . " He put his coffee cup in the exact center of the papers , making a ring . " I do n't think you should sell . " She snatched the cup away . " Robert ... " " Well , I do n't . I think you should let some time pass before you do anything . " He held up his hands in a placating gesture . " Wait , let me finish . My dad says you should never make any big changes right after someone you love dies . You should wait at least a year . You should give yourself time to grieve , to let everything settle so you know what you really want . I do n't think he 's right about much , but I think he might be right about this . " She pictured Robert 's father in her mind , a spectacled , gentle man who was employed as a chemical engineer but spent all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert used to call him Mr. Green Jeans and swore that his father would have been happier if his son had been born a plant . " Robert , " she said gently , " that 's very good advice . " He stared at her in surprise . " I mean it . I 'll give it some thought . " She put the coffee cups aside . Robert was annoying , but she liked him anyway . He was funny and smart and fearless . Maybe more to the point , she could depend on him . He had stood up for her five years earlier when her father had come back into her life . If not for Robert , her grandfather would never have found her trussed up in the caves below the Sinnissippi Park cliffs . It was Robert who had come after her on the night she had confronted her father , when it seemed she was all alone . She had knocked the pins out from under him for his trouble , leaving him senseless on the ground while she went on alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a momentary pang at the memory . Robert was the only real friend she had left from those days . " I have to go back to school tonight , " she said . " How long do you have ? " He shrugged . " Day after tomorrow . " " You came all the way home from California for the weekend ? " He looked uncomfortable . " Well ... " " To visit your parents ? " " Nest ... " " You ca n't say it , can you ? " He shook his head and blushed . " No . " She nodded . " Just so you do n't think I ca n't see through you like glass . You just watch yourself , buster . " He looked down at his feet , embarrassed . She liked him like this -- sweet and vulnerable . " You want to walk over to Gran and Grandpa 's graves with me , put some flowers in their urns ? " He brightened at once . " Sure . " She was already heading for the hall closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Jeez , " he said .
