Section : Business &; technology Create cool software . Give it away on the Internet <p> Bill Gates 's nightmare goes like this : Someday , some way , some new competitor or new technology will leap out of the bushes and steal Microsoft 's business away . <p> Well . . . boo ! Something has jumped from the bushes  --  sooner , perhaps , than Gates ever imagined . <p> That something is called open-source software . And get this : It 's free . Developed by dozens , hundreds , even thousands of devoted volunteers linked up on the Internet , open-source software is poised to unsettle software industry economics . <p> How so ? These collaborative software projects are semipublic ; their internal " source code " is open for anyone to look at , even modify . Companies that make a living selling software , by contrast , keep their source code secret . It 's the core of any computer program , the well from which the software industry 's outsized profit margins flow . <p> But no law says that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source code must be kept under wraps . The open-source volunteers believe that their programming is n't just competitive with commercial software  --  they think it 's better . <p> Their pride and joy is Linux ( pronounced LINN-ucks ) , an operating-system alternative to Windows and the Unix systems used by businesses , universities , and other organizations . Considered by many information-systems managers to be more efficient , stable , reliable , and bug free than other operating systems  --  including Windows  --  Linux has begun nipping at Microsoft 's business while threatening to become something much larger . " Personally , " says David Sims , information-technology manager for Schlumberger , the giant oil field services company , " I think Linux is the future . " <p> Linux is still a pipsqueak in Microsoft 's world , but it 's steadily gaining strength . More than 2 million commercial Linux packages will be sold this year , according to International Data Corp. , and millions of additional copies have been downloaded from the Internet . Still , to put that in perspective , Microsoft has sold 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows NT . <p> So why are people writing software for free ? The volunteers are n't a bunch of hobbyists . They 're serious hackers , in the original sense of the word  --  highly skilled programmers with a creative bent . <p> Most of them have day jobs where they earn their pay developing software in the traditional way ; many are university students . In their spare time , they hack open-source programs for enjoyment , for intellectual stimulation , for ego gratification , or to solve a particular software problem that commercial software ca n't handle . " They do it for love , and people who work for love make better things , " says Kevin Kelly , author of New Rules for the New Economy and a longtime student of hacker culture . Of course , a rabid strain of anti-Microsoft sentiment motivates many of the hackers , too . <p> Profit motive . Users can download all the Linux software they want free off the Internet . But outfits like Red Hat , Caldera , Slackware , SuSE , and others have sprung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs and an instruction manual , package it in shrink wrap , and sell the whole thing for about $50 . These companies plan to earn their profits from support , training , enhanced software , and special services . Last month , Intel , Netscape , and two big venture-capital firms took minority stakes in Research Triangle Park , N.C.-based Red Hat ( so named because cofounder Marc Ewing is still mad at whoever stole his grandfather 's red lacrosse cap ) . <p> Another boost came earlier this year when database makers Informix , Oracle , Sybase , and IBM announced that their latest products will run on Linux . That convinced Jay Jacobs , the Seattle fashion retailer , to choose a Linux system linking headquarters with 105 stores over a system based on Microsoft 's Windows NT . Jacobs 's computer systems vendor , Apropos Retail Management Systems , offers NT . But , says Apropos President Kent McNall , " NT is not a reliable solution right now , and Linux is . " <p> Meantime , major businesses such as Boeing , Mercedes-Benz , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most have been pilot projects , but big companies like Cisco Systems are beginning to move Linux into core operations . One big reason : Microsoft is woefully late with its industrial-strength Windows NT 5.0 operating system , recently renamed Windows 2000 . No ship date has been announced by Microsoft . <p> Microsoft is worried . In a pair of leaked documents posted on the Internet , a Microsoft engineer warns top company executives of a " direct " threat posed by Linux in particular and the open-source movement in general . <p> And , in language that wo n't help Microsoft 's image , he suggests fighting the open-source movement by using Microsoft-only coding against Linux to " deny open-source projects entry into the market . " The suggestion has put Internet standards-setting groups on alert and has caught the attention of Department of Justice lawyers and the state attorneys general now prosecuting Microsoft on antitrust charges . Ed Muth , enterprise group marketing manager for Microsoft , says the memos are one engineer 's analysis meant to provoke discussion and " not a position or a road map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost eight years ago in a most unlikely place : Helsinki , Finland . There , the now legendary Linus Torvalds was a university student , ticked off because he could n't afford the high prices demanded by makers of Unix , the preferred operating system of the technical elite . So he began to write his own version , posting his work in progress on the Internet . He quickly attracted an international community of codevelopers that has steadily grown in size , fame , and prestige . <p> Many hard-core computer enthusiasts were hungry for a new operating system . Many of them sneered at Microsoft 's products , including Torvalds , who believes that " Microsoft has been really bad at making operating systems . Windows NT is only the latest in a long line of technical failures . " The alternative to Windows was Unix , highly regarded but problematic . Not only were Unix systems expensive but the operating system itself had splintered into several not-quite-compatible versions , made by the likes of Sun Microsystems , IBM , and Hewlett-Packard . <p> Thing of beauty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workstations ; by contrast , Torvalds and his Internet buddies set out to create a new Unix for Intel-based PCs and named it Linux after the project leader . Because it cost nothing and ran on cheaper hardware , Linux would be affordable . But to work well on a PC , Linux had to be tight and efficient  --  or , as a skilled hacker might put it , aesthetically appealing , even beautiful . <p> That 's where the power of open-source collaboration comes in . Unencumbered by commercial concerns , the Linux community focuses on writing the best code possible . Unrestricted by the limitations of in-house programmers , Linux draws from the highest IQs on the Internet , who compete in a friendly way to have their ideas incorporated into the product . The requirements for operating systems are almost purely objective . So the best alternative usually is obvious and is incorporated by consensus  --  although Torvalds has final say , which helps preserve a single Linux standard . <p> As a result , Linux is widely admired for its technical proficiency . It is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashes . Some users say they 've gone two years or more without an operating-system crash , a record Microsoft ca n't touch . Gary Nichols , network administrator for data broadcaster WaveTop , says since turning to Linux , " I no longer dream in blue screens , " referring to Microsoft 's post-crash error warning known to systems managers as " the blue screen of death . " Linux fans also say it 's speedier than the competition and so efficient that it runs fast on old hardware , even pre-Pentium 486 machines . <p> For many buyers , the open-source nature of Linux means it 's easier to fix bugs and get help with other problems . And , while big companies argue that customers want the comfort of their support personnel , Linux support is available immediately over the Internet . This year InfoWorld magazine gave its award for best technical support to Linux . <p> Not for novices . Despite all the kudos , Linux is not entirely without problems . Customers are acquiring it mainly to run on servers , computers that manage network traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Linux is unlikely to cut into Microsoft 's Windows desktop market anytime soon . It wo n't run popular Microsoft software , like Word , Excel , and PowerPoint ; its interface is a poor substitute for Windows ; and Linux currently is too difficult for computer novices to use , which rules out most of the general office and home desktop market . <p> And then there 's the weirdness factor . Even if their tech people love it , many top executives ca n't quite grasp the idea of tying their corporate data systems to something developed free on the Internet . If something goes wrong , whom do they sue ? Companies like Red Hat are hoping to change that image , offering customers the stability of a real company to deal with  --  if not to sue . <p> Meantime , Torvalds has moved to Silicon Valley and is working at supersecret Transmeta Corp. , which is financed by billionaire Paul Allen , cofounder of Microsoft . Torvalds says he 's spending about half his time on Linux , overseeing not only further development of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linux for smaller devices like hand-held computers . <p> But do n't talk to him about whether top executives will embrace Linux or not . He 's interested in pure technology , and he really does n't care : " If some company decides they wo n't use Linux because of some distrust , I say that 's your loss . It 's not my problem , right ? " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The artist . Linus Torvalds invented his operating system in Helsinki , Finland <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : They see red . The folks at Red Hat make their money from free software <p> By Russ Mitchell <p> Halloween documents A PEEK BEHIND MICROSOFT 'S MASK <p> The fact that Microsoft executives ordered up internal reports on the open-source software phenomenon should n't surprise anybody . Companies research competitive products and companies all the time . They 'd be dumb not to . <p> Devising strategies to beat the competition is part of the game , too . But what 's intriguing about the reports , which were recently leaked , is the tactics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lock open-source products out of the market . <p> The reports were dubbed the Halloween documents because of the date they were posted on the Internet by hacker activist Eric Raymond . In one of them , Microsoft engineer Vinod Valloppillil recommends that the company " deny open-source projects entry into the market . " He proposes to do this by extending existing " protocols " and adding new ones that would favor Microsoft products over open-source alternatives like the Linux operating system . <p> Simply put , protocols are the rules by which different kinds of software communicate over a network . The Internet is based on " standard " protocols that allow software from different companies to use the network without favoring one over the other . The Internet could n't operate without them . <p> No bite . The Halloween documents make standard-setting organizations wary . Chris Newman , a member of the Internet Engineering Task Force , which governs Internet protocols , says : " The IETF will have to be a little more strict so it is harder to abuse the standards . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , according to IETF veteran Einar Stefferud . " The IETF has no enforcement rules , " he says . <p> Microsoft , in its defense , says that companies write nonstandard protocols all the time to make their products work better . " There are whole classes of problems that ca n't be met by commoditized protocols , " says Ed Muth , the company 's enterprise marketing manager . That 's true . But what about writing those protocols to " deny " a competitor market access ? " I do n't want to defend the individual choice of words of one engineer , " Muth says . <p> Still , the documents were sent to some of Microsoft 's top executives . And the comments seem to fit the pattern that the Department of Justice is trying to prove in its ongoing antitrust case against the company . The trial has been loaded with testimony alleging that Microsoft has tried to bully competitors out of certain markets . An executive from Intel last week recounted what he called a " fairly terrifying " threat that Microsoft would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't withdraw from the market a piece of multimedia software that competed with a Microsoft product . Microsoft accused the executive of personal bias . <p> Whether the Halloween documents are relevant to the trial or not , they represent another blow to the company 's image . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Hacker Eric Raymond put the memos on the Internet <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Russ Mitchell <p>
