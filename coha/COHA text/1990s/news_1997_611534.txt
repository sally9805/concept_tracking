<p> Just months after helping Bill Clinton pay for his first campaign for the White House , Miami super-lawyer Marvin Rosen decided to hang a shingle in Washington . Florida 's premier legal rainmaker announced he could offer clients access and credibility with the new administration . <p> In the four years since , the Connecticut Avenue offices of Greenberg Traurig Hoffman Lipoff Rosen &; Quentel are bustling with a dozen lawyers handling a roster of some three dozen corporate lobbying clients . Rosen has moved from one fund-raising post to another , culminating in his service as finance chairman of the Democratic National Committee for the 1996 campaign . <p> Rosen 's name has barely surfaced in the unfolding story of illegal foreign campaign contributions . But as the DNC 's chief fund-raiser , he not only had a role in hiring and overseeing such key figures as John Huang , but in setting an ethical climate in which some party activists cut corners and tried to parlay their political positions into personal financial gain , according to party officials and outside fund-raisers . <p> To some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to exploit his party role to advance his occupational interests  --  and Greenberg Traurig flourished in the process , building business in new offices in New York as well as Washington . <p> Rosen has said he was interested only in financing Clinton 's reelection  --  a goal he achieved in record-setting fashion . He flatly denies misusing his party post to solicit legal business and points out there was no prohibition against him continuing to practice law while serving as finance chairman . Citing client confidentiality , Rosen declined to say whether he had found new clients among the DNC 's big donors . <p> Fund-raisers always mine for cash among the nation 's wealthiest , and the political bonds they forge turn into business relationships from time to time . Rosen , however , was unusually open in exploiting those ties , according to Democratic Party officials and fund-raisers who worked with him . <p> When Rosen considered taking the finance job in 1995 , he told at least one party leader he intended to take a leave from his firm . In fact , though , Rosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Miami-based firm  --  one of the biggest in Florida  --  helping Greenberg Traurig grow from a regional law firm to an East Coast powerhouse . " I think it 's fair to say that Marvin has for a long time been regarded as a rainmaker at the firm , " his attorney , William Taylor , said . <p> Rosen said in an interview that he was " absolutely scrupulous " about keeping his law practice and his party work separate , explaining that he brought in clients but did no lobbying of Congress or the administration himself . <p> At the DNC , Rosen oversaw a staff of 110 , set broad strategy for raising funds , deciding where to hold Clinton fund-raisers and soliciting money from donors . Rosen has sought to distance himself from the DNC fund-raising controversy , stressing that his position was voluntary and that others had day-to-day management responsibilities . <p> But Rosen 's , approaches to some donors prompted complaints , some party officials said . <p> As the DNC 's principal money man , Rosen steadily moved in the company of Wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich source of potential legal work . Some big-money donors grumbled to party activists that when they called for a favor , he often sent them to a lawyer at his firm with expertise in the area of concern to the donor . Thomas Hale Boggs , one of Washington 's most influential lobbyists , protested to DNC National Chairman Don Fowler that Rosen had tried to steal a client . " I 'm not surprised  --  it 's not the first time , " said Fowler , according to a witness to the exchange . Rosen met the businessman to thank him for giving the DNC $ 50,000 , a contribution solicited by Boggs . Rosen said he never personally solicited the man as a client or knew of any solicitation by one of his partners . <p> Boggs 's complaint was just one of several about Rosen . Last June , Rosen was circulating among donors at a presidential fund-raising gala in Houston when he began pitching a hot stock to wealthy Texas businessmen , according to participants . <p> Two longtime donors were so offended by what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief executive that they protested to Texas presidential campaign chief Garry Mauro , a politician known for bluntness . " Keep Rosen out of Texas , " he later told White House and party officials in Washington , who passed on the complaint to Rosen . <p> Rosen said he does not recall touting the stock or being chastised by party officials for soliciting legal business . White House political director Douglas Sosnik said he heard complaints about Rosen soliciting work and relayed them to Rosen . Rosen said he has " absolutely no recollection " of Sosnik or anyone else raising the issue with him . <p> " He basically looked at everyone as a prospective client , " said a Washington lobbyist active in Democratic fund-raising . <p> Several contributors , fund-raisers and party officials have told The Washington Post that they often heard Rosen introducing himself to donors as finance chairman , then adding : " How do you feel you 're represented in Washington ? If you do n't feel you 're represented well , give my office a call . " Rosen denies ever doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rosen in 1995 about taking the DNC finance chairmanship , said he has not heard complaints about Rosen mixing personal and party business . But he recalled the counsel he gave Rosen early on : " You do n't confuse clients with the work of the party . You keep the two separate . It 's very tricky  --  it 's an art , not a science . . . . You really have to have your moral or ethical compass on at all times . " <p> Manatt said Rosen informed him he would be taking a 14-month leave from his firm , and he assumed the Miami lawyer had done so . Rosen said he never had any intention of taking a leave and that Manatt must have misunderstood . <p> Rosen 's Washington office has steadily grown along with his fund-raising responsibilities , first as fund-raiser for the Clinton administration 's 34-nation Summit of the Americas conference in Miami , then as head of the DNC Business Council and finally as finance chair . The firm signed some new lobbying clients from among generous DNC givers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was not primarily responsible and that he did not bring those companies into the firm . <p> Rosen also had nonpolitical dealings with a pair of Asian American business people who have figured prominently in the campaign contributions controversy . According to informed sources , he was asked to serve as general counsel to an American Asian trade center headed by Charlie Yah-lin Trie , an Arkansas friend of Clinton who raised funds for the president 's legal defense fund from questionable sources . Taylor , Rosen 's attorney , said his client declined the offer . <p> The sources said Rosen also was contacted by an aide to Pauline Kanchanalak , a Thai businesswoman whose $ 253,000 in contributions were returned by the DNC after she admitted they came from her mother-in-law . Kanchanalak 's assistant was seeking Rosen 's help to arrange a meeting for her and the chairman of GTE to discuss a telephone project in Thailand . Rosen said he never served or intended to serve as a broker for Kanchanalak . <p> Rosen had long experience at the nexus of politics and money before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raising campaign money for mayors , commissioners and governors who could send business his way . <p> The finance chairmanship was a natural stop after years of fund-raising , most notably for Sen. Edward M. Kennedy ( D-Mass . ) . Rosen has worked politically for Kennedy since his 1980 presidential primary run and developed a close friendship with the senator . Rosen 's ties to Kennedy were cemented further when his firm hired Kennedy 's wife , Victoria , to help handle an expanding roster of clients in Washington that include health care , construction , transportation , mining and urban interests . <p> With Kennedy promoting him , Rosen easily landed the chairmanship , despite his involvement in a Florida savings and loan controversy several years earlier . Rosen and his Miami firm paid $ 8.1 million to settle a government lawsuit in connection with a failed thrift in which Rosen and two other lawyers owned stock and acted as its attorneys . According to the suit , they allowed the thrift to make a series of imprudent loans that falsely inflated the value of its stock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the peak of its value in 1985 , before the loans went bad and the thrift collapsed . Rosen admitted no wrongdoing in the settlement .
