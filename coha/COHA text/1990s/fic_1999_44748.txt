IN THE HALLWAYS THEY whispered : fight after school , norms against mods , revenge for the destroyed solar cells in the Preston ; : ' car . <p> No way , I thought , but at lunch my friends and I decided to hang around the playground after school just in case . As the day wore on , the classroom dulled , the odds on the fight being the only equation to catch my attention . Mr. Dalton , as always , caught me daydreaming . <p> " Eric ? " Mr. Dalton said , " Have you ever considered using that brain your parents bought for you ? " <p> Mr. Dalton taught the modified gene type advanced class . I have never met anyone who smiled as much as Mr. Dalton , the expression seemingly etched into his thin face , permanent wrinkles bunched around his cheeks from the effort . He prowled behind us , smiling , hands clasped behind his back , his head bobbing on his long neck like some bird of prey . <p> " The logarithm , Eric ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor , shrugged my shoulders and said , " How about two four time ? " <p> He stared at me for a moment , finally got the joke . His smile stretched tighter across his teeth . Along the circle of terminals my mod classmates stared at me as if I was a somewhat amusing monkey . <p> The bell sounded , dismissing the advanced classes . I waited for an hour in the parking lot until the norms were dismissed . The late May sun sent heat ripples dancing on the asphalt and the air smelled of sap and newly mowed grass ; three weeks until the end of eighth grade and the beginning of summer vacation , freedom in the air as thick as the smell of the grass . <p> Soon my norm friends came running and we raced to the best seats on the semi-circle of berms separating the softball diamonds from the neighboring subdivision . There was Lew , who at fifteen was two years older than us , but still in the eighth grade because he had been held back twice , and Screwy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who they called Sleeves because I always wore long-sleeve shirts . Norms and mods never hung out together , but my friends and I were different despite the fact that I worked on trigonometry and the orbit of a gas giant circling Vega while they struggled with x + 20 - 35 . They did n't seem to much care if I had been engineered to a 190+ IQ ; I did n't care if Lew had been held back , or if Screwy had a row of five studs implanted along the side of his nose . Sometimes you can only care about another person if you do n't care . <p> Screwy said , " You think the mods really messed up that car ? " <p> Lew shrugged his shoulders and tipped back the brim of his Stetson . " One day there 's a car and the next day something blows away every solar cell in the whole damn thing . Who else would be smart enough to do that ? Right , Sleeves ? " He glanced over Screwy 's shoulder at me and grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a lightning bolt . <p> I said , " Whoever did it should get a medal . " Screwy wrinkled his clay-colored face , stuck a finger in his ear and fished for ear wax . " All Bobby Preston did was spray paint some wall . " <p> " Not just graffiti , " I said . " He and his pals painted swastikas all over the university genetic research building . If you let that kind of hate crap go unchallenged it 'll get worse . There 's already a move in congress to outlaw genetic modifications . Most norms would support it , would n't blink if they put us in concentration camps . Pretty soon the real brown shirts will be goose-stepping down the streets . " <p> " What the hell are you talking about ? " Screwy said . <p> " It 's called politics . It 's not my fault if I can read . " <p> Screwy said , " Yeah , that 's why we hate mods . " <p> I shoved a handful of grass down the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backpack and was about to leap when Lew tackled him and called him a pin dick . <p> " Your mother , " Screwy said as he squirmed away from Lew . <p> " Least my mother 's not a guy in drag , " Lew laughed . <p> We killed time that way , clowning beneath the fiery circle of the sun until we heard voices coming from behind the back stop . A gang of norms marched onto the pitcher 's mound led by Bobby Preston . Bobby had once tried to play a prank on the principal by ordering ten pizzas and having them delivered to the principal 's house ; unfortunately he gave the pizzeria his own phone number . People like Bobby give norms a bad name . <p> For about ten minutes the norms milled around the pitcher 's mound until a group of my mod classmates left the school . Even at a distance I recognized most of them : Liz was there , whose nylons swished when she crossed her legs , and Justin Moore , engineered for flawless skin as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell-shaped curve . <p> They walked toward the subdivision and as I recognized more faces , my gut went rigid . On the diamond , backpacks hit the dirt , baseball bats fanned the air . " This is n't a fight . They 're going to attack them . " <p> " How do you know ? " Screwy said . <p> " That 's the Greek club . No one over there could defend themselves against a flea . " <p> Sure enough the cat calls and the jeers from the norms rang out and the mob started toward my classmates , Bobby Preston in the lead with a Louisville Slugger in his hands and moronic hate etched into his blubbery face . The mods tried to ignore them , but the norms had a good angle and cut them off before they could reach the subdivision . <p> " You know , " Lew said , " I hate Bobby Preston . Maybe I 'll go make him give me back the five dollars he owes me . " With that , Lew cocked his Stetson and sauntered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was Lew ; not stupid by any means , just living out his personal rebellion fantasy , using failure as a weapon . His father was a drunk , no one knew where his mother lived . My own father walked out on us when I was five . I have n't seen him since . I ca n't remember what he looked like . <p> " Hey pin dick , " Lew yelled . <p> The crowd of norms parted for him . <p> " This ai n't your fight , " Bobby Preston said and backed away . The norms closed in around Lew . <p> " You owe me five bucks , " Lew said . " Pay up or get off my playground . " <p> " This ai n't your .... " <p> " Want to prove me wrong ? " <p> " They messed up my dad 's car ! " <p> " Prove it . " <p> More bodies crowded Lew . <p> Screwy and I stared at each other and I knew we both felt the same disgrace at our cowardice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to stand up to fifteen angry norms . <p> When we got there , Lew had already shoved Bobby Preston to the ground . The mods stood nervously by . Tension charged the hot air like heat lightning . <p> " Take a hike . " Lew laughed . <p> A big kid leapt from the crowd and pinned Lew 's arms behind his back . Bobby Preston scrambled to his feet , his arms swinging backward , the Louisville Slugger tracing an arc through the air , the upswing of which would have caught Lew in the side of the head . <p> I 'm not sure what happened next . People told me about it , but I do n't remember . It was like when you 're in an accident , one moment you 're driving along and the next moment your car is a mangled heap only your brain has mercifully blocked out the actual crash . <p> Bobby Preston lay on the ground screaming , holding his face . The kid still held Lew , both of them too stunned to move . Everyone froze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Screwy and I had been ten feet away when Bobby swung the bat , separated from them by the mob of norms . Now I stood between Bobby and Lew . Pain throbbed through my right hand . Everyone stared at me . <p> " Jesus , " Lew said . <p> The norm released him and jumped back . " Sleeves , how the hell did you do that ? " <p> " Do what ? " I said . Fear scurried up my chest . Bobby staggered to his feet and for a moment dropped his hands from his face . A crimson splotch discolored the side of his face like a massive sunburn in the shape of a hand print . For a moment he stared wild-eyed at me , then turned and bolted , the other norms fleeing with him . <p> " I did n't do anything , " I protested . <p> Lew studied me , the mods in a semi-circle watching me as if I was a science experiment . I caught a glimpse of Bobby Preston , intercepted halfway across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greek Club . <p> " I 've never seen you move that fast , " Lew said . " I 've never seen anyone move that fast . And you stuck your hand in Preston 's face and what did you do to him ? " <p> I looked down ; my palm and my fingertips were red , a mirror image of the burn on Bobby Preston 's face . Something was very wrong . <p> " I did n't do anything , " I said again , lamely . " The hell you did n't , " Lew said . " You saved my life . " Lew extended his hand , but as I reached out to shake it he suddenly yanked his hand back . I had never seen Lew frightened before . Behind him the mods still watched me , then looked beyond me . <p> I turned to face smiling Mr. Dalton , his hands behind his back , head bobbing on his pipe cleaner neck . He studied me , peered at my hand , let his smile become a grin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . I may be able to help you . " His jaw trembled from the effort of holding his smile . <p> THAT NIGHT I SAT at the dinner table , numb , mindlessly rolling olives through the spaghetti sauce . Twice the phone rang and twice I flinched. , knowing it signaled my arrest for disfiguring Bobby Preston . The first call was a survey on laundry detergent , the second a wrong number for someone named Dawn Anne . The world went on . Did n't they know I was in anguish ? Did n't they know something monstrous had happened today ? The phone rang ; my heart beat a rhythm like firecrackers . I answered the phone and again it was the guy trying to find Dawn Anne . Apparently the world did not care about my anguish . I shrugged my shoulders and went to my room . At one point I actually thought of confessing to my mother . She , however , was working late at the board meeting of Franklyn National Life and Casualty . My stepfather Darryl was somewhere , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his acne scars . <p> I did not sleep that night ; every time I closed my eyes I saw Bobby Preston 's burned face , felt bile rise in my throat . I had no idea what I had done , or how I could control it . There was n't even a name I could use to impale it and neutralize it like a butterfly pinned to a specimen board . At times the whole scene on the playground seemed like some terrible television show , an actor burning another actor 's face through the latest computerized special effects . Only it was n't television . I might do it again and really hurt someone this time . So I did not sleep . <p> In the morning I met Lew and Screwy in the parking lot and we sat near the day lilies and pitched gravel at the NoRTH POINTE MIDDLE SCHOOL - HoME oF OF THE PATRIOTS sign . When he was n't eyeing the seventh grade girls , Lew glanced at me , looking like he wanted to ask about the day before , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitation . " Jesus , Sleeves , " he blurted out , " that was great . How did you do it ? The look on Preston 's face ! How 'd you do it ? " <p> I shrugged my shoulders . <p> " Do it again . There 's that Milton kid . Go and .... Lew cuffed him on the ear . <p> " Hey ! " <p> " Shut up . " <p> " That hurt ! " <p> " Now you ca n't hear the answer so do n't ask the question . " Lew said , " Look out . Here it hurt ! " <p> " Now you ca n't hear the and his friends wander so do n't across the parking lotion . " Screwy looked to me for sympathy ; I flicked a pebble at him . Lew said , " Look out . Here it comes . " Bobby Preston and his friends wandered across the parking lot , stopped ten feet away from us and glared . There were times when I actually felt sorry for Bobby Preston ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a father who never hesitated slapping his son and calling him stupid in front of the whole world , Bobby had no choice but to develop the personality of a slow-witted pit bull . <p> " That 's a nasty sunburn you got there , Bobby , " Lew said . The rest of Bobby 's face turned the color of the hand print . " You 're dead meat , " he said , staring at me . I wanted a smart-ass comeback , but all I could manage was , " Oh yeah ? " Fear numbed my mind , fear not of Bobby Preston but of myself . Apparently , smart-ass comebacks were also beyond Bobby . He stuttered , turned the color of a tomato , then marched off , his goons in tow . <p> Now at this point , Screwy gave us a demonstration of how he earned his nickname . Rather than leave well enough alone , he pranced after Bobby Preston , doing a monkey imitation , chattering , " Hey Preston , want some suntan lotion ? " <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him . Screwy turned to flee back to us , found his escape route blocked by Bobby 's pals , then ran for his life across the parking lot , the gang in pursuit . <p> Lew and I watched him disappear behind the school buses , Lew shaking his head and saying , " What an idiot . " " Yeah , but he 's our idiot . " <p> For a few minutes we sat silently , then Lew asked , Sleeves , what the hell did happen yesterday ? " <p> " I do n't know , " I said . " I 've heard of unexpected things happening to people who have been modified . It 's like they switch on genes for intelligence and somehow accidentally switch on something else . I remember reading about this kid who was modified for super math abilities . He was fine until he turned twelve and then something went wrong . His brain stopped sending signals to his body . The kid 's a vegetable now . " I pitched a chunk of asphalt at the sign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lew studied his shoes . " Yeah . It 's kind of like my old man . You never know when he 's gon na go berserk and take a tire iron to your head . " Right , except Lew could run from his crazy father ; my crazy guy was inside my head . <p> The bell rang and we headed for our lockers . Both norms and mods started school at eight , but mods finished in five hours , while norms stayed for six , the idea being that mods needed the extra time for all the wonderful advanced stuff they would certainly do . Which some kids did while many of us went home and watched television . The difference was just another source of friction between mods and norms . <p> The morning passed as always , only this time all the other mods in the advanced class were aware of me . They snuck glances at me . They asked me to sit at their table at lunch . Unthinkingly , I did and only later realized Lew and Screwy were by themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack creatures at heart ; the most popular mods and thus the alpha male and female of the pack were Liz and Justin Moore . As we left the cafeteria , Justin said , " I 'm having a pool party on Saturday . I 'd like you to come . " <p> " Ah , sure , " I said , then hesitated . Lew and Screwy and I had planned to go to the movies on Saturday night . " No , I do n't think so . I 've got plans . " " Hanging out with the retards ? " Liz asked . " My friends are my business . " <p> " Someday you 'll realize you 're one of us , " Justin said . " Those losers you hang around with just pull you down . Maybe it 's about time you live up to your potential . " <p> I had heard this lecture before from my mother . She thought Lew and Screwy were a disease , infecting me with terminal normality . Liz stepped in front of me and pulled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what this is ? " she asked . " It 's a signaling device . Press on it here and it sounds an alarm and your location across the Net to every terminal at every mod 's house . We made it ourselves . " <p> " Nice , " I said . " But you did n't have to go to all the trouble . You can buy that kind of stuff at the mall . " <p> " You do n't understand , " she said . " We have to learn how to make this kind of device by ourselves because one day the norms will come after us . Norms hate us . They hate you , Eric . We need to stick together . We need people like you with your kind of talents . " <p> Somehow , the word " talent " seemed out of place . I felt more like a gargoyle . <p> " I like my friends , " I said . " But you need us , " Justin said . <p> The afternoon went on and soon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized the whole class had remained in their seats and now stared at me . Mr. Dalton circled my desk and smiled . " That must have been a very frightening experience for you yesterday , " he said . " I 'm all right . " <p> " Unfortunately the rumor is spreading around the school . It would be very bad if news of this incident reached the news media . " " I did n't mean it , " I said . <p> " Of course not , " Mr. Dalton said . " But that wo n't matter . Can you see the headlines now ? Mod boy attacks normal child . Freak disfigures child . The media will have fun with that . And just think of our political leaders . Not to mention the police . " His smile stretched tight across his teeth . <p> I studied my shoes . <p> " You know , Eric , your classmates are very worried about you . You 've always held yourself aloof . You 've never joined in . I think you might want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will need each other . " I shrugged my shoulders . " Do you know how you did what you did ? " I shook my head . <p> " It 's not surprising . Very often new talents have a way of sneaking up on a person . It must be frightening . " Liz said , " There 's nothing to be scared of with us . " Justin said , " We can help you . " <p> " I 'd like you to confide in me , " Mr. Dalton said . " Get over your fright . Look at things clearly . " <p> Since the fight on the playground I had been a nervous wreck , but suddenly all of this attention from people who had never before indicated that they knew I existed got on my nerves . The anxiety eased and my old smart-ass personality came back . " It 's not that frightening . It might come in handy when talking to teachers . " <p> Mr. Dalton went on smiling , head bobbing above his quivering adam 's apple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very tolerant of you . With no provocation you 've rejected them , slighted them , some might say you even betrayed them . Instead of mixing with your own kind you insist on consorting with your intellectual inferiors . " <p> " Fuck off , " I said . <p> " Good vocabulary , Eric . Your classmates , on the other hand , are reading Plato in the original Greek . I could teach you something more than gutter talk . " " What 's Greek for fuck off ? " <p> " Very cute , Eric . You can bait me all you want , but it wo n't work . We need to talk . " <p> " I need to go watch television . " <p> Liz said , " You 've been in the same class with us for eight years and you have no idea what the rest of us are doing . You 've never been part of us . Why ? " " Maybe , " Justin said , " because it makes him feel superior being smarter than his imbecilic friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to compete on an equal footing with his intellectual equals . " <p> I turned on him and snapped , " Keep it up and I 'll knock your perfect teeth out . " <p> " All right , " Mr. Dalton yelled . " Cut it out . Now listen to me , Eric . You have a gift . You do not have the luxury of adolescent rebellion . Sit down . " <p> I glared at him , then finally sat , my fists clenched , a rock sitting in the pit of my stomach . <p> " Do you remember Corey Binkman ? " Mr. Dalton said . A vague image of red hair and acne appeared in my mind . <p> " Not long ago , he discovered he can bend metal without touching it . Once upon a time that was a sideshow attraction . Now , without quite understanding how , we 've engineered that ability into a child . Corey is no longer here because I arranged to have him sent to the Advanced Genetic Investigations Institute at Harvard where they will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's with other children who have developed unusual talents . When he 's old enough , he 'll be assured of a scholarship to Harvard . All of the children there have been referred by teachers like myself who specialize in modified children . We form a close knit group and keep our eye out for promising children . Children like yourself . Tomorrow , representatives from the Institute will talk to your parents . They will want you to go with them so that they can study you and .... " " No way , " I blurted out . <p> Mr. Dalton smiled , the expression drawing his skin tight , outlining his cheekbones . " Eric , what you do n't understand is that your classmates and I are truly concerned about you . The plain fact of the matteris that all of the ramifications of the genetic manipulation you underwent prenatally are not fully understood . There are long sequences of genetic code in all of us that are apparently useless . At one time perhaps they served a purpose that later was deselected by evolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred . These redundant nucleotide sequences are still a mystery . However , in some children like yourself , sequences have been accidentally triggered . Unless we can understand what 's going on inside of you , we ca n't control it . You ca n't control it . Think , Eric , it 's not simply what happened yesterday on that playground . Other changes may have occurred . Do you want to gamble on your own well-being ? Think of the stories I 've told you about the tragedies , the talented children who suddenly .... " <p> " I know the stories , " I snapped . <p> " Then pay attention to them . We ca n't control this ability of yours , but if we study it , perhaps we can bring it under conscious volition for you and your classmates . " <p> " They do n't have the same abilities ? " <p> " Not so far . Some may not have the same modifications . Some may have these abilities , but so far the talents are latent . And it is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Justin said , " Yesterday was just a sample of what the norms can do . " Liz said , " It will get worse . We need to protect ourselves . You can help us . " Mr. Dalton said , " I 've dedicated my life to working with children of extraordinary talent . If there were no such thing as genetic modification , talented people would still be picked on . It 's always that way . The average always resent the superior and let their envy turn to hate . Only now it 's worse . There 's a reason , not just blind chance . Talent can be bought , superior intelligence can be manufactured if you have enough money . The ancient conflict between the haves and the have-nots will become genocidal because there is no way the average can win now . You and your kind will soon control the wealth and perhaps even the governments of the world because you are better than the rest . It 's unfair , but that 's the way it is . Sooner or later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So you must protect yourselves . You must take your rightful place and lead the world . " <p> By then , I had shut down , gone numb , heard the words , but understood nothing . I thought he was crazy , thought my mod classmates were creeps and yet something about his words intoxicated me like some drugor alcohol-induced fantasy that makes luminous sense for a moment , then vanishes the moment you try to think clearly about it . Mostly , I wanted to run . <p> " I have to go now , " I said . <p> Mr. Dalton smiled . " You have time to think about it . Go have fun at Justin 's pool party . Get to know your own kind . " <p> " I do n't swim , " I said . <p> " I can teach you , " Liz said . <p> " I did n't say I could n't swim . I said I do n't swim . " " Eric , that 's not really the point , " Mr. Dalton said . " Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're not a prisoner . " <p> So I left , fled the room and the staring faces , waited for Lew and Screwy to be dismissed at our usual meeting place in the parking lot . They never came . I took off for the new housing development where we often killed time and found my two friends sitting on a knoll . I joined them and for a moment we were silent , watching a robotic grader creep across the scarred landscape like an arthritic spider . " How 's your new friends ? " Screwy said . Lew elbowed him in the ribs . <p> " Hey ! " <p> " Shut up . " <p> " They are n't my friends , " I said . <p> " That 's your business , " Lew said and lit a cigarette . He passed it to <p> both of us . I took a drag even though the smell are n't my friends , " I said reeling . <p> " I heard Bobby Preston say they 're going to get your business , " Screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of us . I took a drag even though the smell sent my you threw something in Bobby 's face that burned head reeling . <p> " I shrugged my shoulders . " He can do anything heard Bobby Preston say they 're going to get you , " Screwy said . " They say you threw something in Bobby 's face that burned his neck to peer around Screwy 's shoulders . " Just be I shrugged my shoulders . They 're can do anything he smart enough to be dangerous . " Lew craned his neck to peer around Screwy 's shoulders . " Just be careful . They 're stupid , but they 're smart enough to be movies Saturday ngerous . " Screwy asked . " I 'm not scared , " I said . <p> " We still going to the movies Saturday night ? " Screwy asked . " For sure , " I said . " Can you show me how to do that thing with your hand ? That was awesome ! " <p> " Shut up , " Lew said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . <p> " God , if I had enough money I 'd have them change me like that . " Lew said , " It 'd take all the money in the world just to make you read without moving your lips . " " Least I was never held back . " <p> " That 's because no one could ever stand having you in their class twice . " <p> " Your mother sucks . " " Eat me . " <p> " There 's nothing much to eat . " " Jerk . " <p> I was beginning to feel much better ; I was back among friends . HE NEXT EVENING , men in suits came after dinner and explained the Harvard program to my mother . Darryl was out someplace . <p> My mother nodded her head a lot , looked in awe as if the man was singing a psalm . <p> The man who did most of the talking folded his hands on the stomach that bulged over his belt and said , " And you have to consider that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he was at the Institute . Depending upon the results of our study he might be automatically accepted at Harvard , tuition free . " " Oh , this is so exciting " my mother said . <p> " Screw it , " I said . <p> My mother tittered , but eyed me with her " you 'll pay for that later " look . " Kids , " she said and shrugged her shoulders . <p> " Indeed , " the man said . " Considering that incident the other day I 'm sure Eric is still a bit confused . " I cringed . <p> " What incident ? " my mother asked . " Just fooling around , " I said . <p> The man in the suit cocked his head , squished the fat rolls at his neck . " I 'd hardly call it fooling around . He somehow generated enough heat through his hand to cause second degree burns . " " What ? " my mother whispered . <p> " I 'm sorry . I thought you knew . " He explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at me as if I had just stepped off a flying saucer . <p> " You did that ? " she asked . I shrugged my shoulders . " Fortunately we were able to arrange matters with the local police , " the man said . <p> " The police ? " I said and felt as if a giant had squeezed the air from my lungs . <p> " Well , Eric , " the man said . " You assaulted a boy and burned his face . Naturally his parents informed the authorities . " To my mother he said , <p> " So you see , it would be in everybody 's best interests if Eric went to the Institute . " <p> When he was gone , my mother said , " This is one incredible break . " " I 'm not going , " I said . <p> " If I say you are , then you 're going . I paid a lot of money to give you those advantages . You 're not going to waste them and make me look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her point of view . I waited for her to ask me about the fight . She said nothing . The next day I sat with Lew and Screwy at lunch and Screwy told me about the latest rumor . <p> " Bobby Preston says he 's gon na get your ass , man . He says his brother Billy 's gon na get his high-school friends and then they 're gon na beat the shit out of you . " <p> Lew gurgled Hawaiian Punch through the straw in his juice box . " Looks like I 'll have to have a talk with that boy . " <p> " Forget it , " I said . " I 'm not afraid . " <p> " Did n't say you were . I just do n't like him . " Justin and Liz came to the table and stood over me . " Mr. Dalton wants you to stay after school today . There 's something important you should know about . " Screwy stuck a straw up his nose , then pulled it out and licked the tip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Justin said . " Yeah , whatever , " I said . <p> I did stay that afternoon along with Justin and Liz while the rest of the advanced class went home . Mr. Dalton grinned and waved me over to his terminal and dialed into the Net . " This one , " he said . <p> The message from someone named Archimedes read , " Anyone hear about what happened in California ? some gene freek burned a normal kid with some kind of wird new power ! " <p> After that Mr. Dalton navigated through groups and boards and chat lines all humming with rumors and stories and vindictive debates , all circling back to the story of a mod kid who burned a normal . <p> " I got where I got because I 'm smart daddy did n't buy me a brain . If they 're going to start something then i say kill the bastards . " " Nucleotide manipulation is not a hanging offense , last time I heard . " " Screw you . " <p> " Anytime anyplace . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the literature about unsuspected effects of the engineering . peptide transmutations seem very common . maybe we should shut up a minute and actually study some of these things . " <p> And so on until we arrived at another ominous note from Archimedes . " Apparently it really happened . My friend says it was at the North Pointe Middle School . " <p> My head swam , arms tingled . Mr. Dalton swiveled in his chair . " It was only a matter of time . It will probably reach the network news by tonight , tomorrow at the latest . " " You 're in danger , " Justin said . " You 're putting us all in danger , " Liz said . " Can I go now ? " I said . <p> " Of course , " Mr. Dalton said . " Just remember that if anything happens the best place for you to be is at the Harvard Institute . " I walked slowly from the room , but inside I fled , bolted and ran from the stupidity scrolling across the terminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their business ; I wanted desperately to be them , anyone but a little kid with doom following him like a cloud of gnats . But I was not normal and average and it seemed only a matter of time before the normal folks turned on me . <p> I waited in the parking lot for Lew and Screwy ; I was too nervous to sit still so I compulsively paced circles around a stop sign . Finally the norms were released and we walked toward our subdivision . <p> When we reached my house , Lew stopped and I realized he was n't next to me . I turned , saw him gaping , staring upwards , followed his gaze and then whispered , " Shit . " <p> The windows in my house , the living room and dining room on the first floor and the bedrooms on the second were all shattered , empty frames like the empty sockets of a skull . <p> " Shit , " I said again . The sight was unreal ; I wondered if it was the wrong house , wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mine . Screwy danced around , muttering and pointing at the door . Yellow spray-painted letters read , " Death to Mods " and the graffiti was punctuated by a swastika . <p> " I 'm going to kill that Preston , " Lew growled . Anger surged from my belly to force my hands into fists . As I stared at the vandalized house and the circular holes the rocks had made in the windows , I saw with terrible clarity that there would always be Bobby Prestons , always had been , people who could do anything they wanted to you whenever they liked . The unfairness of it all sickened me , angered me , forced a scream to my lips . But I was silent . <p> That night , after the police left , after Darryl nailed sheets over the windows and my mother had swept up the broken glass , I went to my room and locked the door and tried to summon the force , the whatever the thing was inside of me . Since the day on the playground I had tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that it might overtake me at any moment . Now I welcomed it . I tried to concentrate , but mostly my mind wandered . I tried leaping and spinning , but I only stumbled about the room and stubbed my toe . I tried karate moves , but only ran out of breath . I tried focusing my mind , but summoned only chaos . At last I gave up . <p> And then the call came , Screwy on the other end , breathless , incoherent at first , finally spitting out the news . Lew had gone after Bobby Preston , only this time Preston 's friends had got him and held him down while Bobby shattered Lew 's shoulder with his Louisville Slugger . " We got ta do something , " Screwy wailed . " This sucks ! " " Yeah , " I said . " I 'll do something . " The rage exploded in me like a nova . <p> Of course we went to the emergency room , because who knew where Lew 's father might be . We waited in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms . Even at a distance I knew it was bad . His face was the color of a mushroom . He walked straight and yet seemed to list to the side of his damaged shoulder . I had the feeling that his shoulder would probably never heal right , like those football players who can no longer lift their arms higher than their shoulders . <p> We met him and walked him into the cool night air , silent , just being there . I carried his Stetson for him . Eventually he said , " Next time it 's his ass , " only he did n't say the words as Lew would have said them , but in the hollow voice of someone who knew they had failed yet again , a voice like the crackle of dry leaves . <p> " Sure you will , " I said . The anger inside of me was like white hot metal . <p> PASSED BOBBY PRESTON in the hall the next day . The hand print on his face was almost gone , replaced by flaking skin , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He refused to meet my eyes even though I knew he saw me . I fought back the urge to smash his head against the lockers . At lunch I sat alone until Justin and Liz sat down opposite me . " We heard about your house , " Justin said . Liz said , " It 's just the beginning you know . It 'll get worse . " " Mr. Dalton was telling us about the elections next fall , " Justin said . " He says already the candidates are making us an issue . We 'll be in danger . " <p> " Then I guess we ought to do something about it , " I said . They both blinked at me with their perfectly formed eyes . I told them about Lew . <p> " See what we mean ? " Justin said . <p> " So maybe if we put our advanced brains together we could think up way to stop them . " They glanced at each other , suddenly looking nervous . " What do you mean ? " Liz said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone will think we 're there . If we were to sneak out for a while and then come back , we 'd have an alibi . " " And do what ? " Justin asked . <p> " Make sure Bobby Preston never hurts anyone again , " I said . I was so cold I shivered , hugged myself to stop any visible trembling . Inside the rage had turned cold and reptilian . " You mean kill him ? " Liz gasped . I yearned to say yes , but even at my most bitter I could not say it . " You guys did his old man 's car , did n't you ? " <p> Justin turned the color of the hand print on Bobby Preston 's face , finally nodded his head . <p> " Then this time we go after his house . Just a friendly warning . " " But .... " <p> " That 's the deal , " I said . " I join you , I go to the Institute and in return we fry his house . Agreed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had ever seen them , then both nodded their heads . <p> " Deal , " I said . And the cold was gone and I felt a rush of loneliness , a desperate urge to belong . I was one of them . By Saturday , a fit of nerves almost sent me to the movies with Lew and Screwy , but instead I rolled a bathing suit in a towel and headed for the party . <p> Justin lived in a mammoth colonial at the end of the subdivision with pillars before the main entrance , a pool in the back yard and a sauna in a greenhouse . It was strange to see all of my classmates there in bathing suits , somersaulting off the diving board , behaving just like normal kids . I tried not to stare at Liz , but when I saw her on the diving board , her tall and slender body encased in a swim suit , I found it hard to breathe . Justin slapped me on the back . " You can change in the house . " Which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house and holding my breath . <p> All of the kids whom I had spent most of my life avoiding greeted me as if I had always been their friend . I sat with a circle of kids by the pool and drank Coke and found out who was going steady with whom and which couples were breaking up . Six-foot speakers blared the sounds of electric guitars and drums played as if they were weapons . A cooler of beer was opened . A joint was passed . Above us Ursa Major began its revolution through the night sky . Everything was normal . <p> Justin crooked a finger at me . I followed him behind the greenhouse where Liz was waiting . A small robotic spider , the kind electricians used to thread wire through walls , sat on an overturned garbage : can . Justin grinned and held the metal insect beneath my nose as if he expected me to sniff the thing . " It 's been modified , " he said . " We can send it through the air conditioning , or anyplace there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breaker box , clamp onto a line and send a surge through the wiring . Something 's bound to short circuit and then poof-the house goes up like kindling . " <p> " Wo n't they find it - afterwards I mean . Ca n't they trace it ? " " Nope . There 's a vial of acid set to detonate one hour after we trip the switch . It 'll look just like part of the wreckage . Neat , aye ? " " Neat , " I said . <p> He slapped me on the back and Liz smiled and took my arm and we rejoined the party . I gulped a beer to douse the anxiety singeing my nerves ; anticipation threatened to lift me from my chair and send me into the night like some demented arsonist . <p> The latch on the gate clanked and I looked up to see Mr. Dalton walking toward me , smiling . <p> " Hello , Eric , " he said and sat next to me on a lawn chair . " Do n't look so shocked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's not like a teacher at all . " <p> " I 'm your friend , " Mr. Dalton said and smiled exposing his teeth . " He buys the beer , " Justin said . <p> Mr. Dalton smiled ; his eyes watched me , cold and bird-like , his head bobbed on his scrawny neck . " I ca n't tell you how happy I am that you decided to accept the Institute . Next week we 'll talk about the details of your actual departure . Nice party . " <p> " Yeah , " I said . I wanted him miles away ; if he saw us sneak away he might figure out we were the ones who torched the Preston house . " I have many friends at the Institute , " he said . " They 'll see to it that you 're well treated . It never hurts to have friends in high places . " Justin , beginning to sway from the beer and the joint , laughed a highpitched hyena sound . " High places . Yeah , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get us the circuit diagrams . " I flinched . " What circuit diagrams ? " <p> " The circuits , dunce . " With an exaggerated wink , he stumbled to a group of mods at poolside . <p> A body hit the pool , spraying us , broke the surface , laughing . " I love you kids , " Mr. Dalton said and patted my arm . I pulled my arm away from him . Dalton knew , was in on the plan . He had even given us the device we were about to use to destroy a person 's house . His corruption was like something tangible hanging over the back yard . Suddenly the party was n't fun . The smell of chlorine gagged me . The music was like an assault . <p> No one else was bothered . Liz stood with a cocked hip and ran a hand through her thick hair while she talked to a group of boys . Justin laughed . More bodies hit the pool . The music blared . <p> I went to the cooler and helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basket . <p> I tried to ignore Mr. Dalton , but he appeared next to me as I stood by the pool . " I 'm glad you kids can have fun now , " he said . " Before you know it you 'll be grown and you 'll be running everything . It 's inevitable , you know . " He smiled and patted my shoulder . " You 're the next step in evolution . You 're as far above humans as humans are above apes . You 'll bring down the stupidity of human beings and out of the rubble create a new Athens . " " And of course we 'll remember our friends who protected us , " I said . I had no idea why I said it , the words simply materializing as if someone else had said them . <p> And it happens again . Only this time I am wide awake and conscious of every detail . <p> All of the chaotic movement around me slows while my brain functions at normal speed . Hours pass between the time a boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . <p> I watch . His approach is a straight line . I know the angle of his descent . I see precisely the spot he will hit . He will hit the water flat . He does . The whack of his body on the water is a thunderclap . For ages he remains beneath the water . At last he breaks the surface , bubbles scatter along the water like storm clouds in some cyclonic vortex . The boy grimaces , holds his stomach . I watch each fold in his face reverberate off the next , driving the expression into his forehead , tectonic plates of skin carving a mountain range of a frown . <p> A girl tiptoes across the tiles . She heads for the diving board , but her gait lists to the left . She will turn from the diving board and instead go to the beer cooler . As if I had been watching her all night , I calculate that she will not return to the pool . Beyond my line of sight , a boy is coming to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her without ray ever once thinking that thought , irresistibly drawn to her , propelled by the surging of his blood . <p> The boy enters my line of sight , traveling a path I glimpse from the corner of my eye , joins the girl . They linger at the cooler . They walk arm in arm toward the house , in step , bodies flowing with each other in a soundless swaying tango . <p> It 's as if all the myriad details of life that I normally filter out of conscious perception now come to me in slow motion , giving me time to analyze them all , see the patterns , connect the dots . I know I have done this all along , only subconsciously , and now the process has become conscious , the boundary between the two vanishing , night entwined with day . <p> I watch the boy across the circle from me . I have paid no attention to him all night , but I somehow know he has drunk four beers and finished the joint . I know he will stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have known him for ten years and never noticed his limp , but all the same I know he walks with a slight limp . I have known it all along , but never consciously thought it . <p> The boy stands , loses his balance as he places his weight on his deformed foot , falls back into his chair , laughs , again stands Behind the chair I see four empty beer cans . <p> I turn and watch Justin push his way in slow motion through the group of boys circling Liz and put his arm around her and toss his beer can away . I watch the can arc through the air and descend and bounce in slow motion against the pool tiles . Without looking I know a glass has been set on the ground . I do not remember seeing it , or seeing someone put it down , but somewhere beneath the level of consciousness I must have registered the fact without ever once being aware of it . I know the can 's trajectory will knock it against the glass . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , shatter , chips of glass spinning across the tiles like gas clouds spewing from a supemova . <p> As I watch the glass I know I am calculating something , not knowing what , then suddenly thinking it . <p> Bobby Preston did not trash my house . The norms left school an hour after us . But my classmates had the time while I was detained by Mr. Dalton . <p> I look at Mr. Dalton . Our eyes meet . He smiles . I notice that his smile is made by his mouth alone and that the rest of his face takes no part in the expression . Above the smile his predatory bird eyes watch me , intense , malevolent . <p> He is not our friend . He is not our teacher . He has set the Net buzzing about me . The name Archimedes I saw on the Net makes sense now . He has used the Net and my classmates against me to scare me into accepting the Institute . Perhaps he really believes we will rule the world one day . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty people always gain substance from the shadows of the mighty . I do not care about his motives . <p> He has betrayed me . He has caused my friend to feel pain " You son of a bitch , " I say . Mr. Dalton 's smile falters . " You 're just as sick as Bobby Preston . " " Eric , I .... " Mr. Dalton screams . His face so close to mine contorts like a death 's head . The air fills with the stench of burning flesh . He twists away from me . I am heat . I am the fire of a sun . <p> Mr. Dalton stumbles away from me , stares wildly at the charred flesh of his arm , then drops to his knees and shoves his burnt arm into the pool . The mods back away from me , shocked , scared . For a moment I yearn to go after them all . <p> Instead , I run . I run from the house , run in a circle , endlessly pass the same houses , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand still <p> while the neighborhood revolves around me , endlessly orbits the fiery violence of a star that in reality is a scared shivering boy . Everywhere I go I think of circles and slowly I come to realize the circles are some communication from my brain and my cells in their manic hyperdrive and then I know the meaning of the circles and I collapse for a moment on a lawn and stare at the fabric of diamonds spread across the sky . <p> We are all trapped in our circles , norms and mods and Lew and Liz and me , mindlessly returning again and again to repeat the old patterns of our genes and our lives . I have been hurt by parents who could not love and so I have learned to hurt and in turn hurt Bobby Preston and smiling Mr. Dalton . Something deep within the root cellar of my soul has become manifest in the power to bum . <p> And beneath the learning , hardwired into our genes , is the neverending circle of our pack with all its fear and hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and venomous toad . I want out of my circle . <p> My mind slows down to catch up with the world , or perhaps the world speeds up . Eventually I stood and walked across the subdivision to Lew 's house and sat on his porch and waited for him to return from the movies . Near midnight Lew and Screwy appeared on the walk . Lew fl.inched when he realized someone sat on his porch , instinctively turned his bandaged shoulder away from me , again hesitated when he realized it was me . <p> " Sleeves ? " he said . " What the hell are you doing here ? You 're in a bathing suit and wet and .... " " And you call me Screwy , " Screwy said . They sat on either side of me and I told him about the party , about Mr. Dalton and the mods . <p> " You know what the awful part is ? " Lew finally asked . I shook my head . <p> " I was really looking forward to beating the shit out of Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surprised at the sound of my own voice . " After what they did to you ? " <p> " Sure , it 's personal now . Then your mod buddies will pay . Then we 'll get Mr. Dalton . " <p> " Do n't , " I said . " You 're better than they are . Leave it at that . " Lew lit a cigarette . For a moment I felt dizzy watching the glowing ember , then the feeling passed . We shared the cigarette in the quiet and cool midnight . <p> At last I said , " I think I have to go to the Harvard Institute . I need to know about myself . I have to learn how to control this - whatever it is . " Lew nodded . " So Dalton wins after all . " <p> " No , " I said . " It 's for my own sake . If I meet others like me then maybe we can learn from each other . I just know I have to try something different . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was time to leave . Screwy said , " We would have split up anyways . Next fall 's high school . We 'd go to the public and you 'd go to the academy and we 'd never see each other . " <p> IMG
