While automobile air bags save lives , they can also be lethal . What you need to know to keep your family safe on the road . // IT WAS THE KIND OF CRISP AUTUMN Sunday that makes vou feel like all 's right with the world . Robert Sanders , then 45 , had spent a glorious weekend in Baltimore with his sons , David , 9 , and Matthew , 10. and his 7-year-old daughter , Alison . They played board games and touch football , and even caught Alison 's selected movie , Pocahontas , at the local theater . But as Robert was driving back to Washington . DC , to drop off his children at his ex-wife 's home on October 15 , 1995 , their lives were changed forever . Less than a half mile from Robert 's house , the boys , who were in the backseat , wanted to hear the Redskins football game on the radio . As Alison , who was sitting in the front passenger seat , flipped off her shoulder strap to reach for the dials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your shoulder strap on . I 'll find the game . " But as he fiddled with the radio , a traffic light turned red , and Robert was unable to stop in time . His minivan skidded into a van that had paused in the intersection waiting to turn left . In a flash , both his front air bags deployed . Robert 's first thought was that he 'd need to have some bodywork done on his brand-new minivan . But when the smoky powder released with the air bags cleared , he was horrified to find Alison lying sideways on the seat and unconscious . The ferocious force of the exploding air bag had left the child his ex-wife , Beth , described as " a rav of sunshine " instantly brain-dead . By the next morning , Alison 's parents were in an emotional darkness they are still struggling to find their way out of . For her part , Beth is angry . " We should have been warned that the front seat was not a safe place for a child , " she says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like putting them in front of a loaded gun . " Even more horrifying , three years after Alison 's death , children and small adults are still being killed by air bags in lowspeed crashes that would otherwise result in just a few scrapes and dents that could be fixed at the body shop . The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) says 1()tl people have died in air bag-related accidents-63 children and 45 adults-since the mid-1980 's , when air bags first appeared in cars . ( They became mandatory in September 197 . ) The agency is investigating another 30 deaths . In the same period , another 27 people have been seriously injured . Some safety experts insist that this is just the tip of the iceberg , that many more people have been seriously injured by air bags . In mid-July , General Motors recalled nearly one million Cadillac , Chevrolets , and Pontiacs after reports of almost 100 injuries occurring when their air bags burst without crashes . What 's more , NHTSA is investigating similar problems in Chryslers , Mazdas , Mitsubishis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag-equipped cars coming on the road each month , the toll is likely to rise . Photograph // WhY are so many dying so horribly ? Is it greed on the part of auto companies and the complicity of government regulators , as many consumer advocates charge ? Or is it the irresponsibility of drivers who either put children in the front seat or fail to buckle them up , as many automakers maintain ? And can these deaths and injuries be prevented ? Good Housekeeping 's investigation of air bags found there is plenty of blame to go around , and some-but hardly enoughprogress toward a safe solution . Our key findings * More than 25 percent of air-baguea have been of women who were under five feet four inches call . That 's mainly because many short women sit too close to the steering wheel or dashboard . * Despite repeated warnings from the government , car manufacturers ( including labels on new-car visors ) . and consumer groups against putting children 12 years old and under in passenger seats in front of air bags , a new exclusive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still ride in the front passenger seat , many unbelted . The nonprofit group Safe Communities surveyed 500 vehicles in five states ( Califonia , Florida , Illinois , New York , and Texas ) for Good Housekeeping and found that 23 percent of the front-seat passengers were children under 13 ; half of those were seated in front of air bags . * 1ully 11 percent of parents with infants under age 1 place their children 's car seats in front of a passenger air bag , where deployment probably means instant death . That puts as many as 175,000 babies at risk of dying each year . Without question , air bags are extremely helpful and are appreciated bv consumers . When Good Housekeeping asked 3,503 women to rank the importance of automobile-safety features last April , air bags came up No. 1 . And NHTSA reports that air bags , now in 75 million cars , have saved 3,231 livesabout 30 times the number of lives lost to air bass . Ask Terri Vaccher 32 , who was eight months pregnant when a semi jackknifed in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her Ford Explorer ended up rammed underneath the semi . Fortunateh . Vaccher survived the accident with only a broken kneecap , femur , and ankle . " The air bag in my Ford Explorer saved mv life and mv baby 's life , no question , " says Vaccher . Her son , nicknamed " Crash , " is now nearly 2 years old . Clearly , drivers are often at fault . That 's primarily because air bags are designed to work in conjunction with seat belts , and drivers often do n't buckle up properly or do n't insist that their passengers do . We know : It 's not easy to convince vour 10-year-old to sit in the back , with his seat belt on . Indeed , the majority of the 108 confirmed air-bag fatalities were either children riding in the front in rear-facing infant or car seats ( which these days carry warnings against frontseat placement ) or children or adults who were unbelted or improperly belted while seated in the front . Fewer than 20 percent of those killed-12 adults and three children-were properly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Safety Council , a nonprofit group , " Those who say you can solve this problem entirely with technology alone are wrong . Those who sav you can do it entirely with behavioral changes are wrong . It will take a combination of improved technology and proper belt use to bring about greater safety . " Who 's at risk Photograph // Air bags can kill children and short adults in low-speed crashes for the same reason that they save the lives of larger adults in high-speed collisions : They explode in milliseconds with ferocious force . The victim ends up too close to the bag as it inflates either because she is inappropriately belted and gets thrown forward , or her seat is up too far . The most horrific deaths are those of infants sitting in rear-facing car seats placed in front passenger seats or on laps . In these tpes of cases , the child 's tiny head is within a few inches of the bag when-faster than a blink of an eye-the air bag bursts through the dashboard at speeds of up to 200 miles per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are paralyzed from such crashes . Says Janet Dewey , executive director of the Air Bag &; Seat Belt Safety Campaign : " Putting a rear-facing car seat in front of an air bag can be a virtual death sentence . " Putting children age 12 and under in the front is not much better . Those who are unbelted or not wearing a shoulder strap are in danger of getting hit by the dashboard cover as well as the air bag as it deploys . Others who are too small for seat belts designed for most adults can find their belts sliding up . In such cases , the child 's head , neck , and torso are punched with the force of a sledgehammer as the bag inflates , generally causing death or massive brain damage . Women under five feet two inches are also particularly vulnerable , mainly because they often move their seats so far forward to reach the brake and accelerator pedals that they wind up too close to the bag when it opens . Connie Darling of Toledo lost her 22-year-old daughter , Kelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashed into a pole at 14 mph . When rescue workers reached the scene one minute after the crash , Kelly was dead , her skull split open by the air bag . The five-foot-tall woman had been unbelted with her seat pushed as far forward as possible . " We were absolutely devastated . " says her mother . What 's wrong with crash tests One reason so many short women and children have been airbag victims is the wav crash tests are conducted . A 1984 Federal rule requires automakers to ensure that passenger-safety devices will protect an average-size 165-pound unbelted male in a 30 mph crash into a solid wall . To meet that standard , most car companies have installed air bags that deploy with fearsome force at crash speeds as low as seven or eight mph . Even as this rule was being debated , auto-company engineers warned that such air bags could injure short women and children as well as passengers who are n't seated and belted properly . " The government knew because the automakers told them , " says Barry Felrice , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The big three auto companies , led by Chrysler , were eager to be among the first to market air bag-equipped cars . In order to meet the Federal air-bag performance standard , thev opted for a one-size-fitsall , high-powered bag design . Some consumer groups initially fought the issuance of explicit air-bag warning labels on cars , on the grounds that such labels would unduly scare the public and turn it against air bags . Despite an Urgent Action recommendation bv the National Transportation Safety Board in November 1995 , NHTSA failed to require explicit air-bag warnings until February 1997 , seven years after the first air-bag fatality . By then , the death toll had reached 77 . Another reason families have n't been sitting safely in cars and minivans : materials published by automobile companies . At least one carmaker has promoted its new air bag-equipped vehicles in material featuring children in the front passenger seats , smack in front of the air bags . Even after telling NHTSA in February 1997 that " children are better off in the rear seat to protect them from deployment-interaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 Voyager van with a team of Little Leaguers , one child seemingly unbelted in the front passenger seat . A Chrysler spokesperson says the photograph was " definitely an unfortunate picture , but there was no malice intended " because the photo depicted a stationary car . And in 1994 and 1995 Dodge minivan owners ' manuals , Chrysler advised parents to move up the front seat when attaching a booster seat Because his father did just that , a 4-year-old Maine boy suffered severe brain damage when the vehicle 's air bag deployed on January 29,1997 . He can no longer talk and will be in a wheelchair for the rest of his life . A ChrYsler spokesperson told Good Housekeeping that the manuals contained that advice because the seat belts in the minivans would n't fit snugly against the car seats otherwise . The minivan has been redesigned , and the manual no longer instructs parents to move up the front seat . Photograph The force of the air bag that exploded in front of Alison Sanders when her father 's minivan crashed left the 7-year-old instantly braindead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like putting them in front of a loaded gun , " says Alison 's mother , Beth . // It 's our fault too An astonishing number of Americans refuse to buckle tip themselves and , worse yet , their children . The National Safety Council 's Hurley estimates that only about 63 percent of U.S. drivers and front-seat passengers wear seat belts , versus Canada 's roughly 92 percent . In the United States , nearly 96 percent of the children who died in air bag-related accidents were completely unbelted or improperly restrained ( wearing only a lap belt ) , or in a rear-facing child seat placed on the front passenger seat . Says Hurley : " The real tragedy is that so many of the deaths are avoidable . " Most parents of infants have heard the warnings about air bags , according to a recent poll conducted by Public Opinion Strategies for the Air Bag &; Seat Belt Safety Campaign . Nevertheless , many are still letting their kids sit in front of passenger-side air bags . As our exclusive survey shows , though parents tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is alarming evidence that they are not . This echoes the results of an observational study at a Florida elementary school conducted last June bv Safe Communities . Nearly six out of ten front-seat passengers were children , about one third of whom were sitting in front of an air bag . A 1997 study of crash data by the Ford Motor Company concluded that there are ten times more children riding in front than should be . Explains Joseph Zanga , M.D. , president of the American Academy of Pediatrics : " Many parents still have this sense that if their child is next to them , they can somehow protect the child . The fact is they can not . The only place in a motor vehicle that children are safe is in a rear seat , properly secured . " The " out of position " problem Sometimes , even front-seat passengers who are belted can lose their lives to air bags . Consider the case of Frances Ambrose , 5 , of Nashville , killed by an air bag in September 1996 even though she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother drove Frances home from preschool , a 17-year-old girl ran a stop sign and rammed into the Ambroses ' car , forcing it into a ditch at between five and 12 mph . The initial impact pitched Frances forward and to the right , leaving her head too close to the bag when it deployed . She died the next day . Another problem is what crash experts call " being out of position , " a term referring to people who are not sitting perfectly erect , feet down , with their arms at their sides . Trouble is , getting out of position is easy . All it may take is leaning over to pop in a CD , pick up a cell phone , or grab a map from the glove compartment . Says the Ambroses ' lawyer , Wolfgang Mueller " People do n't deserve to die in fender benders . " Fortunately , a few efforts under way may help prevent more tragedies . This year Congress required NHTSA to enact new testing standards by March 1 , 2000 , forcing auto companies to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in highspeed crashes but also for small adults , children , and out-ofposition passengers in low-speed collisions . In addition , NHTSA has begun letting " high-risk " occupants-such as a child who must sit in the front seat because his medical condition has to be monitored or the short driver who ca n't sit more than ten inches away from the air bag-gain approval from the agency to install on/off air-bag switches . Many dealers and service stations wo n't do the work , however , fearing liability problems . But NHTSA 's Web site ( http : //www.nhtsa.dot.gov ) now lists about 400 places where on/off switches are installed for people who obtain permission to get them . Air bags are getting better Five technological changes will likely make air bags safer : * NHTSA is now letting auto companies produce depowered bags , which automatically reduce the initial deployment force by 20 percent to 35 percent . Many new vehicles have them . * An increasing number of new vehicles contain side air bagsquite useful because so many crashes involve side collisions . These bags are released with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some or all new cars made by Audi , BMW , Cadillac , Chevrolet , Infiniti , Jaguar , Land Rover , Lexus , Mercedes-Benz , Mercury , Nissan , Oldsmobile , Porsche , Saab , Toyota , Volkswagen , and Volvo . * One of the most promising technological advances is the dualthreshold bag . Its sensors automatically determine whether an occupant is belted and adjust the bag 's deployment force accordingly . The air bag will deploy at lower speeds , around ten to 12 mph instead of 16 to 18 mph . " This is one of the most important air-bag advances , " says Hurley , " because it would reduce the number of unnecessary bag deployments in low-speed crashes , where belts provide adequate protection . " * A belt pretensioner is another safety feature available in many new models from Acura , BMW , Lexus , Mercedes-Benz , Saab , Toyota , Volkswagen , and Volvo and becoming increasingly standard in domestic lines like Cadillac , Chevrolet , Oldsmobile , and Pontiac . This device instantly tightens the shoulder strap on impact to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * Automakers and their air-bag suppliers are working feverishly to perfect the " smart " bag , whose sensors would detect not only whether an occur ) ant was belted but also her weight and position . Then , they would adjust the speed and power of the bag 's deployment to the particular person and situation . Merceedes now offers an early version ; more advanced smart bags , however , are at least two years away . Meanwhile , it 's virtually impossible to find out how effective-or dangerous-the air bag is in your car model . Manufacurers , as well as many insurers , believe that this kind of air-hag information would hc too complicated for consumers to understand . But many parents who 've lost children to air bags passionately disagree . " Salesmen can tell you anything you want to know ahout a car 's engine or sound system , " says ( Connie Darling , whose daughter was killed in an air bag-related crash . " But when it comes to something as critically important as the air-hag system , they refer you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have got mt get beyond their concerns about liability and talk safety . " What you can do now If you 'd like the government to release more information about air bags to consumers , write to your congressman and senators and ask them to get NHTSA to rate air-bag systems and make it mandatory for manufacturers to disclose the findings in user-friendly terms in the showrooom . Also , push your local legislature for more stringent seat-belt rules and enforcement . Ten years after California beefed up its seat-belt laws , seat-belt usage has risen from 60 percent to more than 90 percent . Raising the national average that high would save 5,500 lives a year and prevent almost 133,000 injuries according to the U.S. Department of Transportation . Most important , follow these five simple steps to ensure that you and your loved ones are as safe as safc as possible today 1 . Never put an infant in the front seat . Children under age 1 should always be placed in a rear-facing car seat secured properly in the backseat of your vehicle . Check the manuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are compatit ) le with each other , or call NHTSA 's hot line ( 800-424-9393 ) . 2 . Buckle yourself up . Doing so will send an important message to your clildren . According to NHTSA , when adults with children buckle up , so do 94 percent of their kids . But that percentage plummets to only 30 percent when drivers are unbelted. 3 . Move your seat back so your breastbone is at least ten inches away from the steering wheel . If you ca n't reach the pedals in this position , consider having pedal extenders installed . But remember Extenders are permanently installed , so once you put them in , your six-foot-tall spouse wo n't he able to drive your car safely ( for more infomation , see " Should You ( Get Pedal Extenders ? " page 139 ) . 4 . Consider an on/off air-bag switch if necessary . You 'll need to fill out a form , which is available from your motor vehicle department , the Automobile Assosiation of America , or NHSA 's hot line or Web site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 in the backseat . Children ages 4 through 9 are often too small for standard-size seat belts and should be restrained in booster seats . Make sure whatever seat you use is properly attached .
