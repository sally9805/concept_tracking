The weeks of denial for Africa 's most durable dictator , Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire , finally came to an end on Thursday , when his three top generals asked for an urgent meeting . The trio was uncharacteristically blunt . They told Mobutu they could no longer protect him or the capital of Kinshasa from the approaching rebel army of Laurent Desire Kabila , and that if Mobutu valued his life he should flee . A commander had driven to the front east of Kinshasa that morning and concluded that government soldiers would not fight to save Mobutu 's crumbling regime . <P> After a few final hours of procrastination , Mobutu , 66 , ultimately accepted the harsh but just verdict of history . His grossly ruinous reign was finished . On Friday he flew without fanfare to his garish mansion at Gbadolite , 700 miles north of Kinshasa , leaving Information Minister Kin-Kiey Mulumba to announce to the press that the President had " ceased all intervention in the conduct of the affairs of state . " Mobutu , who had said he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late President , " still refused to give up his title . The President " reigns but does not govern , " said Kin-Kiey . <P> But even before Mobutu left the capital , it was clear who was actually in power . U.S. intelligence sources said that throughout last week top army commanders were calling rebel leader Kabila , who already controlled three-quarters of the country , to pledge their allegiance . On Saturday morning Kabila 's ragtag forces marched into the capital without serious opposition and by that night had taken full control . Hundreds of Zairians took to the streets , many of them wearing white headbands and holding palm fronds as signs of support . " Congo libere ! " they shouted . " We are free ! Kabila is here ! " <P> While there were some killings  --  four of Mobutu 's generals were reportedly murdered by their own men  --  the chaotic looting and mayhem that many had feared never occurred . Speaking from his headquarters at Lubumbashi , Kabila , 56 , said he would " assume from now the functions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am happy , very happy to succeed . " He said he would form a transitional government by Tuesday and promised a new constitution within 60 days for the country that he renamed the Democratic Republic of Congo . <P> In the days before Kabila 's forces moved in , scores of Mobutu 's political and military cronies were reported fleeing across the Congo River to Brazzaville in the nation of Congo , some with suitcases full of cash . One man seen steering a speedboat across the river was the hated General Nzimbi Ngbale , head of the elite presidential guard . <P> General Likulia Bolongo , Mobutu 's newest Prime Minister , Thursday night telephoned U.S. Ambassador Daniel Simpson in Kinshasa to announce Mobutu 's impending departure . By week 's end Likulia himself was in Brazzaville . <P> One sign that Mobutu 's end had come : Switzerland announced it had seized his villa at Savigny , near Lausanne , valued at some $5.5 million . Mobutu 's holdings in cash and real estate , most of them in Europe , are said to be worth $4 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets be frozen . <P> In Washington , President Bill Clinton welcomed the downfall of the dictator the U.S. had backed for most of his reign , but issued a stern warning to Kabila . " The U.S. position is clear , " Clinton said . " We want to see a transition to a genuine democracy " in Zaire .
