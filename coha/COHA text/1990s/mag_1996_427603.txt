Section : Lifestyle The plague continues , especially for the uninsured , but new drugs offer hope for living with HIV <p> AT MILE 20 OF THE New York marathon , Jim Howley started to feel sore , afraid he would have to walk the last six miles . His legs were gone , his energy spent . He was freezing . He decided to push it anyway , running as hard as he could for as long as he lasted . He made it to the end , finishing in just over 4i hours . But after the race , he was worried . I thought maybe I was doing permanent damage . ' That Friday , Nov. 8 , he went to a lab for blood testing . I was scared to death . I thought they 'd call me with real bad news . ' The news was good . His level of T-4 cells  --  the immune cells killed by the AIDS virus  --  was still relatively high . And he had no measurable trace of the virus in his blood . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 , is still sunburned from an Ironman triathlon in Hawaii . He first tested positive for HIV 13 years ago , and was diagnosed with full-blown AIDS in 1989 . His doctor gave him about a year and a half to live . Rather than give in to despair , he threw himself into exercise , determined to fend off the disease . But his T-cell count kept dropping . By last year , it had fallen to 3 ( a healthy person has about 500 to 1,500 ) . He was losing weight rapidly and his hair had started to fall out . He developed cytomegalovirus ( CMV ) retinitis , a potentially fatal opportunistic virus that left him partially blind in his right eye , then Kaposi 's sarcoma , the deadly AIDS-related skin cancer marked by raw lesions . On paper , I was a corpse . ' <p> In September 1995 , Howley started on a new combination of drugs , including two that had just been rushed onto the market , Norvir and saquinavir . They belong to a barely tested class of AIDS medications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to replicate ( page 68 ) . His T-cells crept up from 3 to 5 to 7 , a slight increase every month . Early this year they reached 69 , then a month later , 260 . Suddenly he was faced with an alien prospect : living . After so long , this , too , is a challenge . Now I 'm going to have the same problems other people have , ' he says . For a while there I was released of all that . I did n't have to worry about the future . I did n't have to worry about retirement , getting older , looking bad . Now it 's all come back , ' he says . But it 's great . ' <p> SINCE 1983 , A DIAGNOSIS OF HIV-positive has been an automatic death sentence , one that has transformed communities , binding some together in solidarity and tearing others apart in fear . It now hangs over a million men , women and children in America , an additional 21 million worldwide . But in the last year , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , people with AIDS had only one drug option , AZT ; now there are nine , which can work in more than 100 different combinations , or cocktails . ' Already 60,000 Americans are taking the most popular protease inhibitor , Crixivan . For 14 years , everyone in this country has been conditioned to the idea that once you 're infected with HIV , you 're gon na die , ' says Stella Fitzgibbons , an AIDS doctor whose brother-in-law is having mixed results on the new drugs . The idea that these people will be able to stay with us and lead productive lives is really quite amazing . It 's like a revolution . ' <p> This is not the end of the plague . Not everyone can take the new medications , and no one knows how long the positive effects will last . Because the drugs are so expensive , costing up to $25,000 a year , they wo n't help the developing world , which now accounts for more than 90 percent of all adult AIDS or HIV cases . Even in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , coldly splitting the AIDS population into haves and have-nots . But despite these drawbacks , this year 's breakthroughs do mark the end of our long-established way of thinking about the virus . Doctors are starting to consider HIV a chronic , manageable disease rather than a death sentence . Huge swaths of the American psyche in the age of AIDS  --  how we view sex , trust , responsibility  --  will have to change . <p> With the promise of the new drugs , new questions arise : How does a population psychologically braced to die suddenly get on with the business of living ? If people start to see AIDS as no longer deadly , how do you get them to practice safe sex ? When the wealthy feel secure , will the cause lose its celebrity and urgency ? In an era of budget cuts , will the government still afford compassion toward those not helped by the drug ? Finally , AIDS radically reshaped the gay community , brought it out of the closet ; without the crisis , how will the community sustain itself ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager , the disease posed a somewhat simpler question . Last fall , he says , I did n't feel there was much reason to keep going . ' He had to feed himself through an IV in his arm because he could n't tolerate food . His weight fell from 155 pounds to 125 ; his body was racked by esophageal CMV . A virus similar to warts covered his face . I did n't look very pretty , ' says Johnson . It was n't my idea of life . ' His partner , Tom Lloyd , who is also HIV-positive , says he sat with him and watched him cry . ' In his sickness , Johnson pondered what he really wanted from life . Among more existential possibilities , a tangible answer presented itself : he wanted an Isuzu Rodeo , fully loaded . He cashed in half his life-insurance policy and paid cash for the car . His doctor had to sign a paper saying he would probably die within six months . The insurance company did n't ask for a second opinion . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3TC  --  22 pills a day , dispensed in a tackle box . Within a few weeks he started feeling better . His first reaction : I was angry . ' Prepared to die , he found it difficult to make the shift to life . What the f  --  k am I supposed to do now ? ' He was angry at people who had n't been through his ordeal , angry that they could n't understand what it was like . He felt keenly the loss of a friend who had died last January , too soon to have tried the cocktail . And he had a hotshot car on his hands . <p> His financial dilemma is not uncommon . Jon Argenziano , who helps run the AIDS Action Committee support group in Boston , says some members have made remarkable recoveries only to realize , I thought I was going to be dead next year and I owe $25,000 on my credit cards . I 've wiped out all my resources . ' Johnson sold the Isuzu , leased a more modest model and started exercising again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing disability payments , Johnson is n't worried  --  yet . He 's thinking about getting an M.B.A . and working for a nonprofit group . His viral load  --  the amount of the AIDS virus in his body  --  is lower than Lloyd 's . They remain optimistic but wary . It 's hopeful and it 's cautious and it 's wonderful and it 's awful and it 's empowering and it 's diminishing , ' says Johnson . It 's all of that at the same time . ' <p> Stories like Johnson 's and Howley 's  --  and there are many  --  have become talismanic for AIDS patients and doctors . I go to work feeling like there 's something I can do for my patients , ' says Dr. Harvey Makadon , a Boston AIDS specialist . I did not feel as clear about that a year ago . ' The success paradigm even has a name : the Lazarus effect . More drugs keep coming , more options , more time , more hope . It is a circle of life : all you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the next , and the next . <p> But many people do not respond to the new drugs , or can not tolerate them . Patients with long exposure to AZT seem to show small or short-lived improvement on the cocktail . And like AZT , the new chemicals can be extremely toxic . Cynara Chatman-Dillon , 43 , a management consultant in Oakland , Calif. , describes her four months on Crixivan : It felt like I was dying . ' She was violently nauseated and could n't walk . Her viral load was dropping  --  I was just thrilled '  --  but she would scream if anyone touched her . When I woke up finally in the fetal position with every muscle in my body on fire , I said , That 's it . ' Talk about quality of life . There was none . ' She has now been off the cocktail for two months . Her viral load is rising and her T-cells are down to 90 . Like many women of color , she is wary of the medical establishment because the drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looking for a woman doctor . And she 's hoping for a new cocktail , hoping that her experience with Crixivan did n't leave her with cross-resistance ' to the other protease inhibitors . <p> EVEN SUCCESSFUL PATIENTS have reason to be watchful . The Lazarus effect may not last . Under pressure from AIDS activists , the Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) hastened approval of the new drugs without long-term testing . Dr. Jerome Groopman , chief of experimental medicine at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston , is optimistic about protease inhibitors . He has overseen unimaginable recoveries , including that of David Sanford , an editor at The Wall Street Journal , who wrote movingly about his rebirth . But over the last two to four months , Groopman says , some patients have been showing signs of the benefits wearing off . ' This effect , too , has earned a name : crashing . Most people who have crashed were in the advanced stages of the disease before treatment , or had long histories with AZT . But since the drugs have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling how many will crash , or when . <p> In his Washington , D.C. , support group , Gary Rose , 45 , an AIDS treatment and research coordinator , has seen men career through all stages of hope and despair . First there arose this unspoken conflict between the people the drugs were working for and those who they 're not working for . ' One man who had been very sick got much better , buoying the hopes of others . Now , Rose says , his viral load has shot back up again and no one knows why . Seeing that Lazarus experience starting to fail has made everyone very jumpy . The fear is that some of us have almost no immune system left , so we may not have enough immune system for these medications to latch onto . ' Rose , who tested positive in 1985 , says he has become afraid to dream . I spent a long time divesting myself of all my dreams . What if everything falls through again ? How can I go through all that again ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that chance . Krantz , 30 , a cook and waiter in Indianapolis , tested positive for HIV in July 1995 , and his T-cell count is falling . He is uninsured . His take-home pay  --  $11,000 a year at most  --  is nowhere near enough to pay for treatment . If he were indigent or disabled , he might be able to get the drugs through Medicaid , which covers half of the nation 's AIDS patients . But for people like him , working people with limited resources , coverage is spotty . Some manage to enroll in trial programs with the drug companies or medical schools . Others get drugs through the state and the federally funded ADAP ( AIDS Drug Assistance Program ) . But Indiana is one of 35 states whose ADAP , as of September , did not cover protease inhibitors . <p> To a great extent , the drugs emerged faster than the systems to pay for them . In the last month the federal government poured an emergency $167 million into the strained ADAP system . The hardest-hit states  --  New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other states have set up lotteries to dispense the drugs to a lucky few , a grim way to parcel out possible life or death . Missouri , for example , will choose 75 people from among 2,639 needing assistance . <p> In Indiana , Krantz has been on a waiting list since last December just to get AZT . Already he has $1,000 in medical bills he ca n't pay . He does not even know how fast his disease is progressing because he ca n't afford a viral-load test , which costs an additional $250 . When he hears the Lazarus stories , their promise comes laced with anguish . I feel that I should be on any number of protease inhibitors right now , but I ca n't get them . It 's so frustrating . ' <p> Cases like Krantz 's are especially haunting as HIV has changed its path . Though often associated with gay white men , the virus now hits hardest in poor and minority communities . The infection rate among African-Americans is five times higher than among whites . Conditions are even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' says Richard Marlink , executive director of the Harvard AIDS Institute . The average person infected with HIV is of color . ' For many , the new drugs are out of reach , a tragedy reminiscent of malaria and tuberculosis  --  we have a cure , but millions die anyway because they ca n't afford it . In our own communities , ' says Marlink , the have-nots are just like people in developing countries . It 's a dangerous public-health message to represent these drugs as the first step in the end of the epidemic . ' <p> In many cases , money alone is not the issue . Combination therapies require incredibly demanding regimens  --  sometimes as many as 30 or 40 pills a day , distributed over a strict timetable . Some drugs have to be taken with food , others on an empty stomach . And if patients fall off the regimen , they risk cultivating a strain of the virus that 's resistant to one or more of the drugs . For drug injectors , or for people with unstable housing or food supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs , ritonavir , requires refrigeration , ' says Victoria Sharp , codirector of the AIDS program at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York . Well , we have patients who do n't have refrigerators . Another one requires you to maintain a low-fat diet and eat at particular times . Some patients access their meals through soup kitchens , so they have no control over dietary fat or timing . ' <p> New York 's Dr. Doug Dietrich is an HIV specialist who helped write AIDS guidelines for Blue Cross/Blue Shield , insurers for one in four Americans . He speaks in the bland , pragmatic language of his trade . In discussing access to the new cocktails , he talks of screening for compliance , ' an innocuous locution for a form of actuarial Darwinism . If you give protease inhibitors to people who are not compliant , they 're really a waste , ' he says . It 's tantamount to flushing them down the toilet . ' S. J. Avery , executive director of Bronx AIDS Services , calls the resulting process , with equal blandness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears her clients , hardest hit by the virus , may be deselected for treatment because they fit the stereotype of patients who can not adhere to the regimen . To add insult , some fear being scapegoated as potential breeders of a drug-resistant supervirus . <p> Also , as AIDS shifts to poor communities , it plays to the phenomenon known as compassion fatigue . At the AIDS support group PAWS/LA , for example , individual donations are down 25 percent in the last year . As more people feel the crisis is over , ' says Joel Kimmel , director of development , the people who gave $5 and $10 checks are moving on to other causes  --  the environment , cancer  --  and the larger institutions are going back to schools , the opera . ' Jim Graham , who runs the Whitman-Walker Clinic in Washington , D.C. , which relied on $10 million in donations for 1996 , fears that 3 to 10 percent of donors will flake off . In a world of competing woes , many just want to wash their hands of AIDS rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . By that I mean , heart disease is important , but it does n't have an emergency sense about it . ' Marlink of Harvard is more blunt . The message that middle-class white males are doing better , he says , makes it that much harder to raise interest , funds and collaboration . It 's harder to get national funding around specific populations that do n't reflect the average elder , white senator . ' <p> An even bigger danger is complacency . Americans have greatly struggled with safer sex and safer injection practices . However well known the risks , the reality is that sometimes getting a clean needle or a condom is too much trouble . The new drugs make it even harder to stay safe . Chris Dechant , who hosts a syndicated gay radio show out of Chicago , says he has already seen a new sexual carelessness . Dechant , 36 , is HIV-positive ; a close friend on the cocktail is dying . I 've heard this out on the street : Why worry about it ? Why use a condom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pill and get rid of it ' . ' In theory , a person taking the cocktail can infect partners with drug-resistant strains of the virus . This has already happened with AZT . About 20 percent of Americans with AIDS today are resistant to the drug because they got the disease from someone taking it . <p> For Jim Howley , the marathon runner , these worries may be real , but they are abstract . He lives on more material readings : T-cell counts , viral-load measurements , the constant effort to get into trials for newer drugs . After he tested positive , he hurled himself into excess : obsessive exercise , but also too much cocaine , too much work . Now he volunteers two days a week as a therapist at a gay and lesbian group . He and his partner of five years just had a commitment ceremony ; they 're looking into long-term investments and IRAs . Now I have to find a job , ' he says  --  one with good insurance . In March he wants to run , swim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease can be beaten . It 's just incredible . And it 's not just me . It 's so many people it 's happening to . ' <p> Behind his story , of course , lie the faces of others who will never get the drugs , or for whom they wo n't work . But behind these , also pressing , also painful , are the faces of those who died too soon , never knowing the hope that even the most unproven remedies can offer . Some are our friends , our family , our loved ones . If this is the end of the beginning , bring on the beginning of the end . A Growing Arsenal Against HIV <p> Over the past decade the FDA has approved nine drugs  --  six RT inhibitors and three protease inhibitors  --  to combat the AIDS virus . None of them is very effective by itself , but researchers are finding that certain three-drug combinations can shackle HIV for long periods .
