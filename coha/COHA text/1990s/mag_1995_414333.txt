Even though bowhunting seasons are still weeks away , every weekend thousands of archers are taking to the woods , plains , and swamps , bow in hand . And they 're shooting everything from huge bull elk to woodchucks . What is this , some wild-eyed bowhunter 's revolt Not at all . The lifelike animals are made of foam , yet that fact does n't detract from the explosive growth of 3-D archery . A hybrid of bowhunting and target shooting , 3-D archery is to bowhunting what sporting clays is to upland wingshooting . And like sporting clays in the 1980s , 3-D is evolving at an extraordinary rate . Ken Watkins , president of the International Bowhunting Organization , says his group numbered just 28 members in 1984 , but today it boasts 917 IBO-affiliated clubs , each with a membership of about 75 . Every year the IBO sanctions 220 qualifier tournaments , the National Triple-Crown Championship , and the indoor and outdoor World Championship , as well as family-oriented Bowhunter Defense Fund weekends . Watkins estimates that there are between in 375,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't alone , either . Danny Moree , executive vice president of the Archery Shooters Association , says the ASA claims 35,000 members and reports 15,000 entries in its seven annual Pro-Am tournaments alone . And each year the ASA presents 130 3-D tournaments designed for amateurs and beginners . Hey , 3-D is spreading like kudzu . Takeoff Point The origins of this sport lie in a decades-long search by archers for life like , life-size practice targets of cardboard or foam . To add realism , the targets were set in natural surroundings and incorporated true bowhunting challenges . But the sport really took off when a ready supply of lifelike targets became available . " There 's no question that the interest has always been there . People have been shooting at two-dimensional targets in the woods for years , ' says Mike Ingold , product developer for McKenzie Targets , the world 's largest manufacture ; of 3-D targets . " Then , in the late 1980s , targets started being made of flexible foam  --  we now had a product that looked like a deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appealed to bowhunters , who could take their hunting equipment to a course and have more fun while practicing . " But inevitably , whenever shooters get together , competitions develop  --  and with the 3-D competitions came substantial prizes . A single tournament win today may mean a purse of $25,000 . And simultaneously , the quest for more reliable and more competitive equipment has pushed the archery industry toward high-dollar , space-age materials and specially engineered arrows , bows , sights , and releases . To further challenge shooters , some courses stretched shooting distances to double what conscientious bowhunters would attempt during the fall seasons . Optimal " kill " zones were reduced to under two inches . As this trend progressed , however , the sport threatened to escape its **36;120;TOOLONG roots . The consensus was that 3-D archery had become too intimidating for beginners and bowhunters who did n't have the skill , desire , and/or finances for top-level competition . Happily , those days are gone . As Ingold , an enthusiastic 3-D shooter and bowhunter , says , " We 've gone back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations are backing their yardages down to distances that are more like you 'd find in bowhunting . " Pains are also taken to ensure that 3-D shots realistically represent the shots a bowhunter might take in the field . " We 're careful that we do n't offer any shots that would be unethical for a good bowhunter , " says the ASA 's Moree . " We do n't promote any shots over 45 yards , and we make sure there are n't any shots at targets facing the shooter or angling sharply away from him . " Moree is proud that the ASA limits arrow speeds to 280 feet per second . " For a while , what you basically had was a velocity race , " he says . " People were pushing it to the limit , and some were even having their bows blow up on them . We think our " speed limit " keeps things safe and in perspective , and it makes the competition more fair . " Many courses and organizations are also making sure that they appeal to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-proliferating variety of target shapes helps to keep bowhunters ' interest level high . Just as realistic deer , bear , and elk targets helped lure hunters into the sport a half-decade ago , now lifelike replicas of caribou , bighorn sheep , mountain goats , mountain lions , foxes , woodchucks , turkeys , and other targets , placed in natural settings , are drawing more and more shooters . Both the IBO and ASA are working hard to promote shooting opportunities for average archers . " We have a series of four events this year that are geared solely for the bowhunter just out to have fun , " says Watkins of the IBO . " They 're a weekend-style rendezvous that includes some games , but most of the shoot does n't even utilize scores . We want these weekends to be an enjoyable learning experience . " Watkins adds , " The IBO is best known for its competitive tournaments , but we are a bowhunting organization . The tournaments spread public awareness of the IBO , but our primary concern is to protect bowhunters ' rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement  --  and we hope in the next five years to raise half a million dollars per year for our campaign . " Everyone Wins Like the IBO , the ASA is also seriously concerned with providing opportunities for all levels of archers . " We have classes for all types of shooters , " says Moree . " That even includes beginners like the guy who goes and buys an inexpensive bow at Wal-Mart . We have a hunter class for them , and no shots are over 27 yards . They 'll have fun , meet experienced archers , and learn a lot . " As surely as 3-D participation is growing among bowhunters , it 's also spreading beyond their traditional ranks . From coast to coast , shooters and range organizers are reporting a steady increase in the number of women and children at 3-D ranges  --  and no wonder . Archery is one of the few sports that can appeal to multiple generations . Tim Krine , an avid bowhunter and 3-D shooter from Arvada , Colo. , takes his wife , Elizabeth , and daughters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but they 're far from spectators . " We really enjoy the shooting , " says Krine . " My wife wins a lot , and my girls do real good . My daughters are nine and eight years old and can really shoot with the new kids ' equipment that 's out there . It seems like everyone wins but me . " But Krine is the first to admit that everyone is a winner during his family 's weekend camping trips and 3-D shoots . " I know they 're building family strength for us , " he says . " I think it 'll help keep us together in years to come . I also hope in five or six years , when the girls start driving and dating , some of the lessons they 've learned about respect , self-confidence , and self-control will help them take care of themselves . I do n't think they 'll be as apt to follow the crowd if in it 's heading in the wrong direction . " But who knows , if family participation in this exciting new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friday night that crowd may just take Krine 's daughters to the nearest 3-D range . 3-D TARGETS ARE POPPING UP EVERYWHERE While many archers praise the fact that 3-D shooting gives them a chance to walk and shoot in the great outdoors , a growing number are also enjoying an animal-target sport that has them standing still indoors . " Our main goal is to make the shooting as realistic as possible , like what you 'd find in the woods , " says Rick Barnett , tournament director , Whitetail Hunters/Bowmaster 3-D Archery Tournament . " We have our shooters shoot from a simulated tree stand , and we do n't give them a lot of time . Like in bowhunting , you only have a few seconds to estimate the range , aim , and make the shoot . " Barnett says that most of his indoor shoots feature seven targets placed at distances from 10 to 50 years . While on stand , the shooter is presented with five randomly selected targets , which pop up and drop back down in a matter of seconds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fourteen such shoots are slated for 1995 , with many more on the horizon . Though currently popular with both recreational and competitive archers , competitive shooters may reap the biggest rewards as the concept grows . " I 'm also selling affiliated courses  --  some will be stationary and other swill be portable , " says Barnett . " I 've sold nine recently , and my plan is to have 96 affiliated courses and to hold a variety of qualifying shoots in six regions of the country . It looks like that 'll happen in two , maybe three years . When it does , we eventually should be able to have a prize pot that 's worth well over $1,000,000 . " <p>
