I. <p> Fair is foul and foul is fair <p> Such is the flavor of the prickly pear . <p> - Scottish proverb <p> " May I wash my hands asked Lady Macbeth , and since it would be a good hour before the capons were ready , I pointed her in the direction of the green bathroom . Earlier that day I had furtively lined the racks with cheap acrylic hand towels , hoping to avoid any mishaps . The previous Sunday , after our weekly mimosa brunch , Lady Macbeth had washed her hands for six hours straight . Apparently the pockmarked visage of the cheese babka had borne some sort of resemblance to her father . <p> Despite her eccentric manners , however , Lady Macbeth remained sought-after by many of Scotland 's best families . She attended teas and weddings , and had a special fondness for christenings , when she might watch the bishop submerge a goggleeyed infant , a tiny stream of bubbles coursing from its nostrils just beneath the still surface of the water . She was a woman , I believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty-one , Lady Macbeth stood five foot nine , broad of shoulder and languid of gait . She danced a good tarantella , her long , flat feet brushing the floor . Her slightly crossed eyes were the color of moss ; the pupils , perpetually dilated , a deep indigo . She quaffed her ale with gusto and told stories about the thane-ofthis and the thane-ofthat , about battles with the Jutes and the Franks , about banquets when the halls ran red with blood and glutinous with mead . As she spoke , her voice grew increasingly husky until we all bent close so as not to miss a single one of her half-whispered words . Her eyes would move from one rapt face to the next , thin , bluish lips twisting into that half-smile for which she was so famous . When she gathered up her skirts and rose , elevated lords swept bows to her , their plumes grazing the floor and tickling her toes . When she mounted her horse , a dozen stable boys ran to her assistance , each hoping she would let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , none of them ever succeeded . Elgar , an apoplectic Appaloosa with an aversion to peasants , bucked wildly if any of them tried to get close . In the frenzy of hooves , a number of these luckless youths were kicked in the head and lived the rest of their lives as smiling idiots , fit only to carry oats . <p> I had been looking forward to this dinner for some time . I had recently come of age-the previous Tuesday , to be exact-and although the birthday celebration had been a modest one ( my sister cooked a flan , my uncle Bertram supplied the Talisker , and the two kitchen maids , Nina and Pinta , did a charming vaudeville number in my honor , donning sombreros laden with ripe fruit and pulling each other offstage with a cane ) , the event was not without symbolic value . I had always been the family pip-squeak-rascally , pigeon-toed , with a shrill laugh like a tea kettle hitting a boil . But from this day on I would brush my hair back wet , wear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oblong buckles . Through the window , I saw the prickly pear plants under a light rain , their fleshy green boughs aquiver , their bristles pearlescent with dew . They were mine now ; at the age of twenty-one , I had inherited my father 's fabulous fruit fortune . In a phrase , I was Prickly Pear King . <p> My new title meant more than lawyers with fancy fountain pens and yellowing wigs , more than prickly pear chutney in swollen jars , the labels bearing my name in sloping silver letters . I was in need of a Prickly Pear Queen . The Walnut King had a Walnut Queen , a small , brittle , wrinkled woman with oily hair and a delicious scent ; the Beet King had a Beet Queen , ruddy and bold , with a bassoon of a voice . But the Prickly Pear Queen had to be a different sort of creature . The prickly pear was no simple fruit , and no safe one either . It was bracing , contradictory , a metaphysical fruit both crabbed and sweet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lizard ; on the tongue , a mulch both pebbly and wet . Its shape was mysterious ; its fragrance , intoxicating . And yet it was more than shape and fragrance ; it was a state of being . It was Lady Macbeth . <p> Lady Macbeth was in good spirits that night . I served oysters , which she took between thumb and forefinger and slurped up with bacchanalian relish , revealing a pearl between her teeth . Girlishly , she offered to help clear and , not taking no for an answer , caught the empty shells in a great clattering heap in her skirt . She did not linger with the finger bowl . <p> I proposed that evening , dropping to one knee so that she could rest her narrow , iron-colored boot on the back of my neck . <p> " I have poor sleeping habits . I listen to the night birds , " she told me . <p> " Pish , " I replied , examining the perfect ovals of her kneecaps . She had a run in her stocking . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Tush , " I countered , thrusting back my shoulders , losing my balance , and nearly toppling into the fire . <p> " Everything I touch withers and dies , " she muttered . Her brows gathered like unkempt clouds , and she began to rake her fingers through her hair . <p> " Balderdash , " I snorted , pulling her hand free . I had heard such warnings from friends and family , from peers and publicans , but their fatalistic drivel made me snicker . In Lady Macbeth I saw what I wanted-a woman driven and daunting , a cohort and an icon . I spread my arms to embrace the world at large , the hills and valleys studded with berries , vines , legume patches ; with Lady Macbeth by my side , I would gather in a rich and swollen harvest of red and yellow cactus pears . Gently , I turned her around to view the vast estate over which she would be mistress . Despite her protests , I felt a tremor of pleasure run through her rib cage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been there before . " <p> I threw back my head and looked her full in the face . She was chewing her lip , sending a slim thread of blood down her chin . <p> " This time it will be different , " I stated firmly . <p> I took her two hands in mine . They were dry , hot , and chalky , but they pressed assent . <p> II . <p> Here we go round the prickly pear <p> Prickly pear prickly pear . . . <p> -T . S. Eliot , " The Hollow Men " <p> The first years of our marriage were happy ones . Lady Macbeth was a picturesque Pear Queen . Unflummoxed on the float that bore her , she stood lean and proud , crown on her head , scepter in hand , hair and train flowing behind her like syrup . As I had expected , she was also a fine hostess . Her Tokay parties were famous bubbling with jazz and clinking with Bohemian crystal . On May Day she would lead a procession of marriageable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's spring line , and parade them before the county 's most eligible thanes . A remarkably fit woman with pulsing quadriceps , she led walking tours of the highlands , pointing out all her favorite owls , ravens , and daws to the other ladies , who snatched up the binoculars in their slender gloved hands as if they were being passed cups of toddy . She was a lively and lusty bed partner , turning down the sheets with abandon and arching her back so that each vertebra cracked , one by one , in perfectly timed , tingling succession . Nor were the simple domestic skills lost on her . She was a good country cook ; watching her whip eggs with the rungs of bracelets clacking and gleaming on her arms was a fine sight to see . <p> But in the third year of our marriage , there was a blight . Oyster-size pellets of hail rained down upon the prickly pear plants , bruising their flat , flabby arms and weakening their foothold in the sand . In the middle of the night we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rise to the windows , where we stood , Lady Macbeth in her taupe negligee , I in my nightshirt and matching peaked cap . Mouth partly open , gaunt cheeks flat and cold as panes of glass , my wife watched the cacti with the silent solicitude of a mother . <p> For their success had become her obsession . She brought them up by hand , molding the bulbous shoots into the soil , strapping them to sticks to improve their stature . She would squirt them with great perfumy gusts from her insecticide gun , her face and shoulders draped like a sheik 's . As they developed their stubbly green armor , their wee bristies , she called them her " little men . " And what a day for rejoicing it had been when they bore fruit ! Even now I can see her rapt face as she knelt down to finger a pair of twin pears , bulging shy and tender as testicles from a leathery pad . <p> But now , as she gazed out upon the orchard , she knew in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lightning seared the vault of the sky , revealing the entire orchard its rows upon rows of small spongy plants executing a grotesque , writhing dance . " Everything I touch , it withers and dies , " she murmured to the tune of " London Bridge . " " Withers and dies , withers and dies . " She gyrated gently back and forth . <p> My wife 's eating habits now began to change . She turned up her nose at dishes that used to make her squeal and applaud with delight deviled eggs , tripe , osso buco . Now she favored only white rice , cooked al dente , which she spoon-fed herself grain by grain , and black olives . When she had chewed away the meat of each olive , she rolled her tongue around the thick , bare pit for hours-she could suck it and speak at the same time , much like a ragtime pianist with his ever-present cigar . My wife proceeded to line up the pits on the windowsill to dry , after which she stabbed them with needles and strung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeira line ; they were popular among the housemaids . When she stopped eating altogether , they could do nothing but stand about haplessly in their unfinished olive ensembles-Elvira with a single earring , Bonnie Doon with a halfstrung choker . <p> She became distraught , bit her nails to the quick . She forgot to attend jousting parties , mead-hall openings , armory visits . My wife , who had always been so particular about footwear , traipsed about in last autumn 's lace-ups-ostrich skin , the pores worn and pale as boils . All day she smoked , absentmindedly tapping ashes into the saucepan as she cooked sweetbreads , into the tub as she drew her bath , killing all the potted plants and filling my spittoon . Her teeth , once long , clean , and pointed , turned a malty yellow and developed hairline cracks . I reminded her that when my dear mother died of emphysema , her lungs had swelled up to six times their natural size , but Lady Macbeth turned away . <p> " I must have something to do with my hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I backed away , my bedroom slippers shuffling meekly . Outside spread a vast forest of shrunken shrubs . <p> III . <p> Macbeth shall never vanquish 'd be , until <p> Great Birnam wood to <p> high Dunsinane hill <p> Shall come against him . <p> - Macbeth , IV . i <p> It was a relief when my wife 's three aunts decided to visit . They were maiden sisters named Sass , Fran , and Letty-comfortable , elderly women who were always needing a fourth at bridge . They lived in a homely stone cottage in Luna Glenn , a small province in the heart of goat country , and Lady Macbeth brightened at memories of the garden in which she had played as a child , how they used to dress her up in tattered boys ' clothes and serve her pink tea with ginger root . The soil was full of rills and rocks , not to mention turtles , which were often mistaken for rocks . Aunt Sass , who tended the turtles she found ailing , brought along Jerry , her current pet , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Erminegarde , so named because the animal sat on Fran 's white stole and growled at anyone who tried to make off with it . Fran wore the stole the evening we went to see Lucia di Lammermoor-our first night out in weeks . The three sisters passed my wife 's binoculars back and forth , chirping appreciatively during Lucia 's mad scene . They seemed to share almost everything . They shared a single monocle as they read the paper every morning at breakfast . They finished one another 's sentences ; when I inquired if the bad weather would be abating , they shook their heads sorrowfully and replied " hail " almost in unison . Their knitting flowed together in a great tangle of pink , baby blue , and goldenrod . Only Letty stood out a little-the youngest of the three and the smartest dresser , she sported a yellow pillbox hat at all times and had a penchant for facials . I wondered if she still kept a hope chest . <p> " Cup of tea ? " asked Aunt Sass one wet afternoon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally to ask their advice about their afflicted niece , who was safely out of earshot in the ocher bedroom . Lady Macbeth would spend hours up there pacing and wringing her hands to the beat of the metronome , knuckles clacking together like castanets . <p> I generally declined highland tea , but I felt a sudden craving for the sisters ' blend , a fruity , purplish brew , not quite crab apple and not quite elderberry . Proffering my cup , I watched the hot liquid make an arc amidst coils of violet steam . I shifted from foot to foot as I asked them , somewhat sheepishly , if I might be losing my touch as a husband and a husbandman , as a fruiterer and a king . <p> Sass , who was stirring the mixture with a darning needle , was the first to speak . <p> " Whether his fate be joy or despair . . . , " she said . <p> " . . . the answer lies with the prickly pear , " Fran finished . <p> All three nodded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glinted in the flicker of the hurricane lamp as she let drop a dollop of honey , which fell like an amber tear . It skirted about , chased its own tail , then took the form of a pear , gleaming crimson and ominous in the firelight . <p> IV . <p> Methought I heard a voice cry , <p> Sleep no more ! <p> - Macbeth , II . i <p> The strangest occurrences took place at night . Lady Macbeth thrashed and kicked , crowing in her sleep or half-rising with her veil of hair wrapping her face and broad , bare shoulders . She clawed and gurgled for light . I was aware that in her heyday my wife had been a notorious sleepwalker , and now I would rise to find the bed curtains parted , pearl morning light shining cold across her empty , dented pillow . The sheets were often strewn with burrs and crushed leaves . One time a dead mouse turned up , its forkclawed feet in the air . <p> As my wife vehemently refused all forms of medical attention , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ingenuity . I invited to dinner a Dr. Maurice Ravel , better known for his music than for his credentials from the Ecole Normale Superieure . My wife was an admirer of the Impressionist movement , and , as I expected , the two of them had much to talk about , she leaning down the table as her hair trailed into her soup , he twiddling his pert thumbs and chewing his small Latin mustache . She invited him to see her garden the next day-perhaps he could compose something about the azaleas , such moody , brooding buds ? - and he played for her the first bars of his Bolero . He tried them again and again , modulating the brassiness , then the tempo , but it was never quite right ; I left when he started shouting , " Sacrebleu ! " in frustration . I returned home that evening to find both of them laboring together , Dr. Ravel still pounding on the piano , Lady Macbeth sawing an old viola , both of them shrieking , " Sacrebleu ! " and tearing out their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the parlor , my wife 's reedy strands mingled with Ravel 's neat brown tufts . <p> " There is nothing I can do for her , " he announced to me after a month , packing up his rectilinear black doctor 's bag . Large bald spots had appeared on his head , and his mustache quivered uncontrollably . My wife had absurdly high blood pressure , he told me ; all traces of salt , sugar , and soy should be removed from her diet . " Mais enfin , " he said , dropping his voice discreetly , " the true problem is psychologique . A condition about which very little , as yet , is known . The Clytemnestra Complex , the Freudians call it . " <p> " Is there a cure ? " I queried . <p> Dr. Ravel shook his head . " Parbleu , there is none . The symptoms , which can grow quite hideous , are for a husband 's eyes , not my own . Look to your wife . " He paused , then added with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to yourself , vous-meme , as well . " And with that , he scribbled a prescription on the back of a page of sheet music. * " Strictly a placebo , " he snapped , and was gone , never to cross my threshold again . <p> He had prescribed , as it turned out , candied yams . <p> V. <p> Who can impress the forest ; bid the tree <p> Unfix his earth-bound root ? <p> - Macbeth , IV . i <p> Since infancy , I had had the capacity to dream the instant I was supine , but now I began to toss and itch , smacking my thick eiderdown pillow into different shapes-a pumpkin , a turtle , a hedgehog . At first I thought this was due to indigestion ; I had been forced to consume tripe and leftover rarebit ever since the cook , like much of the domestic staff , gave notice . With as much tact as she could muster , Chatterly had mentioned an increase in rats and silverfish , as well as owls , which hooted at all hours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angus , the philandering footman , without pairs of eyes staring down on you from the branches of every tree . Delilah , a delicate young parlormaid , complained of the drafts that blasted through the corridors , lifting curtains and area rugs like old women do at rummage sales . The family home , which had stood stalwart for generations , was quaking to its foundations . The roof leaked an oddly viscous fluid that dripped down my back and neck each morning as I chewed on my shriveled and solitary poached egg . <p> One night I was awakened by a new sound . It was not the chorus of the owls , the chafing of the katydids , the yelping of the wolverines , or the cry of any of the other forms of wildlife that had of late become so vociferous . Instead , I heard a soft chattering , still distant . I glanced at my wife to see if she had noticed it , but she was lying stiff and chill beside me . An icy breeze parted the bed curtains , and I followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Letty were assembled in the parlor . They had put aside their bridge game and their half-nibbled Social Tea biscuits , and sat crouched with joined hands , tittering excitedly , their quilted housecoats drawn around their hoary bodies . With a sudden crash , the veranda doors flew open . A great wind lifted up the sisters ' milkweed hair and chased the cards about like a flock of bats . The room swelled with the rustling of leaves . Beneath it all drummed another sound , a deep , low pounding , ever steady . <p> " What can this mean ? " I gasped , but was silenced by Sass and Fran , who pressed fingers to their withered , coral-smeared lips . The floor began to tremble . Earth , mud , and rain gusted in our faces . A howl rose up , the groan of twisting opuntia . <p> " Though nature seems to seal her womb . . . , " said Sass . <p> " For sprigs and seeds a frigid tomb Fran went on . <p> " The blighted blossoms somehow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificent flourish , in the direction of the orchard . <p> I turned . The prickly pears were on the march . Scores of them spilled across the terrain , down the dips and over the rills , their fruit glowing blood purple in the gathering dusk . At last I understood their force , inexorable as fate itself . As they gained ground , I could see them flexing their pudgy arms , hear them humming softly in gummy , nasal voices-or was that the caroling of the wind ? <p> A joyous shriek rang out behind us . Lady Macbeth stood lean and haughty at the top of the stairs , her face pale as a melting taper . Arms outstretched to the advancing shrubs , she beckoned , she commanded , she welcomed them home . <p> Author Affiliation
