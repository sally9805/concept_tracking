It was an odd sort of neighborhood , even for New Orleans . I should have realized that the first time I looked from the upstairs window of my newly rented house and saw the gray rooftops rising out of the thickets of semitropical greenery like a lost city in a jungle . Or on my first walk up and down Azalea Place , when every glance into an opulent patio brought me a return stare from a mossy , mottled gargoyle . <p> Certainly I should have realized it was a strange place when Mrs. DeSaye called on me two days after I moved in . She was a sort of one-woman Unwelcome Wagon and she came , apparently , to empty the Dispose-All of her mind on my living room rug . Or  --  looking back  --  to give me a sense of her importance , even to make a veiled threat or two ? <p> Mrs. DeSaye was a stout lady with bulging eyes and a metallic-looking blond wig . While I was scaring up coffee and macaroons and biscotti to nibble on , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of burglars , spies , warlocks , and adulterers . Meantime she inspected with voracious interest as much of the interior of the house as she could see . I gathered she had not been welcome when the owner , Angela Barberino , had been in residence . <p> " Oh , I know her , " she said darkly , taking a macaroon . " Italian . Now , I do n't say every Italian is Morpha Mafia ? but her husband Joe had that look about him , sort of squat and he was in casinos . And after all , somebody shot into my attic on New Year 's Eve , though why the hit man thought I 'd be up there I do n't know . " <p> " People in this town do shoot a lot on New Year 's Eve , do n't they ? " I put in . " They certainly did when I was growing up here . Maybe it was a wild shot . " <p> " Nothing ever happens by accident , " she said . " People said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Vidakovich . Well , maybe and maybe not . He had been threatening to sue me because somebody told him I had said in the Piggly Wiggly that he was probably a Russian spy . With a name like that , what else , I 'd like to know ? " <p> I was about to say that Vidakovich was South Slav rather than Russian , but then let it pass . I had already grasped that Mrs DeSaye did n't deal in fine distinctions , such as whether one 's ancestors came from Great Russia or a thousand miles to the west . <p> " And then he started to put up a brick spite fence along our property line . The workmen had just arrived when he had a fit of some kind and rolled into the way and the truck backed over him . So you see ! " <p> Actually , I did n't . But a.lifetime spent in and out of embassies has left me half convinced that lies are the normal coinage of human intercourse . So I grinned fatuously and poured her some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Mrs. DeSaye . I therefore resolved to be especially nice to her , on the grand old diplomatic principle that if you do n't set ' em up you ca n't knock ' era down . <p> " Nothing happens by accident , " she repeated . " For instance , why did my Prettypuss disappear ? Sure as life it was Colonel Kennedy 's dog that killed her . " <p> " Who is Colonel Kennedy ? " <p> She looked at me with undisguised contempt . I realized that Mrs. DeSaye was so deeply entangled in the life of Azalea Place that she literally found it impossible to imagine that anyone , even if he had moved in only two days before , could be ignorant of at least the basic facts of the neighborhood . <p> " Colonel Kennedy , " she said , " is Angela Barberino 's lover . They live in the house right over there . It was when she moved in with him after Joe 's death that this house became available for leasing . " <p> She munched and sipped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expression in them said again , " So you see ! " <p> I believed I was beginning to get the idea . Since nothing happens by accident , Joe Barberino 's death had been no accident either . <p> " And Colonel Kennedy 's , uh  --  dog ? " I queried , assuming that Prettypuss 's disappearance was a related crime . I was not , however , prepared for Mrs. DeSaye 's next revelation . <p> " Marble , " she said . " The dog 's made of marble . It stands in his front yard . It 's  --  " she lowered her voice  --  " a Familiar . " <p> She nodded importantly . " The dog 's a demon , " she said , and helped herself to a macaroon . <p> " Surely not , " I murmured . Generally , the rule is that the crazier somebody is the more you agree with them , because disagreeing with a lunatic gets you nowhere . But there were limits . A dead Mafioso , shots in the attic , Vidakovich and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prettypuss eaten by a marble dog ! No . And again , no . <p> " It serves its master during life and then takes another one at his death . It belonged to Kennedy 's wife when she was alive . A Chinese woman . Just the kind of thing you 'd expect from an interracial marriage . Well , when the Colonel moved in , it was white , white marble . White as bone . I used to see it and think , What a pretty white ! Well , just look it at today . It 's gone pink . " <p> She sipped her coffee , then noticed that I was still baffled . <p> " From the blood , " she explained impatiently , in case I was dense , which I suppose I was . She added with surprising depth of venom , " I 'll never forgive Kennedy for what happened to my cat , never . " <p> An idea came to me . Perhaps Mrs. DeSaye herself was a kind of irritating and demanding Familiar of Azalea Place , and resented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roaring , " I 'm possessing this street ! " whenever another demon showed up . <p> This thought was so entertaining that I pressed another macaroon on her . <p> " Oh , no , " she said , eyeing it with longing . " I 'm trying to lose some weight . " <p> " You ? ? " I said , in a tone implying that she was just short of bulimic . <p> " Well , perhaps one , " she sighed , and started telling me about a string of burglaries in the neighborhood . " Not . in my , house , of course , " she said darkly , " I have protection . " I was too weary of her tiring company to ask what sort of protection a widow living alone might have that would send burglars scurrying . And I was delighted when , at last , she left . <p> A few days later I had a chance to meet Colonel Kennedy and his demon dog . Angela , the Mafia widow , arranged it . <p> She was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a great mass of black hair and not a streak of gray anywhere . She called on me to make me welcome in Azalea Place , and to collect my check for the rent , and after we had chatted for a while and eaten the last of the macaroons she invited me to step next door and meet her Jim . <p> " So you were in the Army , too , " she said , mulling over a piece of information I 'd given her . <p> " Just for a few years . Back in the Sixties during Nam . I 've been in , uh , other services since then . " <p> " Jim will be interested . He was in for thirty years and spent most of the time in Asia . He was an area expert and he speaks Chinese and I do n't know what all . " <p> Colonel Kennedy was spreading pine bark mulch in the garden behind their strong iron gate . He was tall , thin and straight , with a clipped white mustache and unsmiling tobacco-colored eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomat and he and Angela showed me around the garden . It was a handsome place . Birds were singing , the banana trees were exhuberant and water trickled from the mouth of a bronze dragon into a little brick pond set among blooming impatiens . Fancy carp switched their flowing fins like transparent capes and a purple water hyacinth had just opened . <p> Also I met the marble dog , seated in a mass of dark green groundcover . It was your ordinary Foo Dog , but a big one  --  nearly four feet high  --  and , for whatever reason , definitely reddish in color . <p> " Fine animal , " Kennedy said , patting it . " They 're legendary creatures , part dog , part lion , you know . Favorite with Ming , my wife . Her father  --  well , he was a grim old devil , to be frank  --  one of Chiang Kaishek 's secret police types . Torturer . Straight out of the Golden Horde . His father in turn had been a young idealist with Sun Yatsen at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered , soon after . This dog was made to guard the Imperial Palace and when the dynasty fell it was found in a blood-spattered courtyard . No bodies , just blood , as the old man told it . " <p> " Oh dear , " said Angela . " I wish you would n't tell this story . " <p> " Well , it was bloody time . Anyway , Ming 's grandpa took it away and gave it a place of honor in his home , then passed it on to his son , who gave it to Ming to protect her . She gave it to me when she was dying of cancer . The old dynasty was the Manchu Dynasty , so I call him Foo Manchu . " <p> He smiled with straight , even teeth and I put on my usual fatuous , disarming grin . There was something about Kennedy 's eyes that intrigued me . I had seen similar eyes before  --  flat and depthless  --  on professional soldiers and cops and killers . Eyes that are always taking aim . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common name , of course , but I had been in JAG  --  the Judge Advocate General 's section  --  in Nam in 1965-66 . And there had been some talk about possibly bringing charges against a brilliant young captain named Kennedy who had done something that was out of line .... I could n't remember exactly what . And then the matter was dropped and nothing said . The time when a My Lai incident could take over the newspapers was still a long way in the future then . <p> I told Kennedy and Angela that Mrs. DeSaye had visited me and Angela rolled her eyes up to heaven . <p> " I suppose you heard all the local gossip suitably embellished with ghoulies and ghosties , " she said . <p> " Woman 's a nut , " said Kennedy , beginning to spread mulch again . " Thinks she can cast spells . She used to come in here and chatter and throw out hints . I had to tell her not to come back . " <p> " I suppose she 's harmless , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Kennedy . <p> I left them in the garden with the birds and flowers and Foo Manchu standing guard , all bulging eyes and swirling mane and big sharp claws . Part dog , part lion , eh ? Nice pet to have if the one nonsupernatural item in Mrs. DeSaye 's list of local happenings  --  the string of burglaries - proved to be a fact . <p> As to what had happened to Angela 's husband , I heard about that from Mrs. Williams . Just as Mrs. DeSaye was the block captain , Mrs. Williams was the neighborhood equivalent of CNN . Because she cleaned people 's houses she knew all , and she told practically everything . The only trouble was , the gossip you wanted to hear came mixed with a lot of other information about people you had never met and never would meet . <p> In cleaning my house Mrs. Williams was brisk and efficient . Floors , furniture , rugs , dishes , all straightened out like idling soldiers who form rank and file when somebody in authority shouts a command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for air . I gathered that life had been unkind to her , that she had had an unsatisfactory husband and an even less satisfactory son . <p> " That man of mine was a rapscallion and I ai n't surprise Derrick be such a dead loss . I beat that boy with both hands and a broomstick , but I shoulda used a flatiron on him , nothin ' else be any good . But you never know how people gon na turn out , do you ? Joe Barberino he was a nice man and look what happen to him . " <p> " What did happen to him ? " <p> " He was just a nice Eyetalian man what run the Girl of the Golden West . A riverboat casino , I guessed . Then somebody put the grisgris on him . He start to see snakes , roaches and so on and he was n't drinkin ' enough for that . In fact , hardly at all . I told him pray , only prayer be your shield when a witch go after you . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Bugs ! ' and flappin ' his arms like crazy . Pretty soon his heart just give out . Good thing for Angela that Colonel Kennedy moved into the block just then . And now that damn old witch-bitch got him in her sights , too . Count of that cat of hers . " <p> " You mean Mrs.  --  " <p> " Oh , you know who I mean . Her whole life be little fights and big revenges . But this time she 's makin ' a mistake . The Colonel , he been to a far country and brought a friend back with him . " <p> " What kind of friend ? " <p> " The kind of friend everybody need these days . " <p> Meeting Angela one day in Audubon Park  --  there 's a regular track around the lagoon and the golf course , and everybody exercises there , slow or fast according to their abilities  --  I fell in beside her and puffed along , trying to keep up with her power walk . <p> " Mrs. Williams thinks Mrs. DeSaye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well of course she is . " <p> " I mean the actual hex kind and that she 's brewing some of the bad stuff for your friend Kennedy . " <p> " I think she 's bitten off more than she can chew , " smiled Angela and pulled away from me steadily . A mile-long alley of giant oaks overspread the walk and gray Spanish moss streamed out on a damp breeze smelling of rain . I slowed down , panting , and watched Angela disappear in the distance , a big woman still full of youthful energy and swinging her arms like lane Fonds in her exercise mode . <p> That night I almost met the neighborhood burglar . I 've seen a lot of bad stuff in my life and at three or four in the morning it all comes back to me . When I ca n't sleep I get up and walk around in the dark . I get a glass of water or milk , sometimes sit down in an easy chair and fall asleep and do n't wake until morning . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you get used to it , not color exactly , but shades and tints . I wonder sometimes if the plate I carry in my head from getting blown up in Nam has changed subtly the way I perceive light or if everyone sees much the same thing . <p> This night I was standing at an upstairs window looking down into my yard . The sky was overcast and dully illuminated by the reflection of the city lights and down below me the lawn seemed to exhale a kind of dim light of its own , with islands of profound darkness around the grove of banana trees and the masses of sweet olive and lugustrum . Suddenly I saw a human figure detach itself from the trees and cross the lawn and disappear into the shadow of the house . Then a sound of scratching began at one of the patio doors downstairs . <p> I slipped my nine-millimeter out of a dresser drawer and padded down the stairs , feeling the cold dry metal begin to warm and get slick in my hand . Nervous ? Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left-hand door and thought about putting a shot into it . But that would cause a lot of trouble , one way or another , and ruin the door besides . Instead , I switched on the outside lights . For an instant a man 's figure was outlined against the drapes and then it was gone , and the noise of somebody blundering through the shrubbery followed . I called 911 , and two hours later the cops showed up while I was eating breakfast , made a few notes , and went away again . <p> Not much as urban crime stories go . But there was an old lady living alone down the block  --  Mrs. Vidakovich , as a matter of fact , whose husband had been at odds with Mrs. DeSaye when the brick truck backed over him . Two days later Mrs. Williams arrived to clean her house and found her lying in a pool of blood . There was a broken window and the place had been turned upside down . Maybe Mrs. V had surprised the burglar or simply had been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , a bad one . <p> Mrs. V had no close relatives and she had made Angela the executor of her will . Angela arranged for the cremation and the memorial ceremony . Mrs. DeSaye was n't invited , but I was . The ceremony was held on the deck of the Algiers ferry , with Colonel Kennedy supporting Angela while a small group of neighbors and elderly friends of the deceased shifted from foot to foot , listening to her read from the Book of Ecclesiastes , apparently a favorite with the deceased . <p> " Vanity of vanities , " Angela cried , her voice high and clear over the thunder of the engine and the cries of gulls , " all is vanity . " <p> A fresh raw wind whipped down the river and Colonel Kennedy emptied the urn and the gray ashes scattered over the glittering wavelets of the Father of Waters and disappeared . Then one of the old lady 's friends said a few words , the burden of which was that violence was pointless and whoever uses the sword will perish by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking , what a lot of people I know will have to perish ! <p> When we reached the west bank , the mourners all went to a Cajun restaurant for nourishment and a number of us got potted . Even Jim and Angela lifted more than a few glasses . I do n't know where the feeling comes from that funerals are festivals but a lot of New Orleanians have it ; it 's like the jazz funeral that starts in tears and ends in a carnival . Mrs. V 's friends all agreed that she had been a chipper old soul who had lived a long life and a good one and that the achievement deserved celebration , not sorrow . The party coming back was downright hilarious , and my usual siesta became a matter of sleeping off the unaccustomed noontime drinks . <p> A day or two later I met Mrs. DeSaye on the street and put on my usual silly grin and bade her good morning . She was having none of it . <p> " Personally , " she said without preamble , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pissed off , I thought , because she was n't invited . <p> " Too bad it was n't yours , " I smiled , " so you could arrange it properly . " The words just slipped out . You see , at that point I was n't afraid of her in the least . Mrs. DeSaye struck me as silly rather than threatening . <p> But now she gave me a look that almost made me believe in the evil eye . Her baggy lids bunched up over those bulging pale blue eyes until the little black pupils in the center gleamed like splinters of jet . <p> " I 'm not ready to arrange mine , " she said . <p> She spoke in the damndest voice I ever heard . It was n't any louder than normal yet it seemed to echo ; I could swear I heard it echo off the houses across the street . Then she walked on , an ordinary bulbous lady on a quiet urban street . Christ , I thought , I wonder if I 've just been hexed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a heart attack ? Or maybe run into the street and jump under a truck ? <p> That was what I was half expecting . However , our neighborhood was somewhat oversupplied with the preternatural . Something else struck first . <p> A morning or two later I was setting out for my walk in the park , hoping to meet Angela on the way , when I spotted her in her power-walking togs standing in front of her gate and staring at the ground . Her face was n't so much horrified as paralyzed and when I hurried up to her I could see why . <p> The right hand of a black man was lying in a puddle of congealed blood just outside the gate . The hand was already swarming with ants . Angela , white-faced , fell back inside the open gate and propped herself against Foo Manchu . <p> " Please , " she said . " Call Jim . " <p> I hastened to the house and rapped on the door . A few minutes later , the cops notified by phone , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to look any more , but I managed to tear my eyes away long enough to note that around the Foo Dog the earth was torn up and that the statue was now a deep , lustrous red with complex patterns of purple veining . <p> Then the cops pulled up and after giving a statement to a polite , pudgy black detective , I went home . Next day , while Mrs. Williams worked , I walked my rent check next door with more than a hope that I might hear something more . There was a bell beside the gate and I rang , bringing Kennedy who took the check , thanked me , and proved to be in an uncommonly chatty mood . <p> " It 's become a neighborhood sight , " he said , as we stood together gazing at the fatal spot , now considerably torn up by souvenir collectors . <p> Angela arrived , carrying a cup of coffee , and stood by his side at the gate . Behind them golden and already hot sunlight drenched the garden ; the azaleas had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be an extravagant bloom and there was something in the air , sweet , heavy , and insinuating , that I thought could only be cape jasmine , just opening . <p> " They check the fingerprints on the hand ? " I asked . <p> " That detective from NOPD called this morning to say it was some ex-felon called Derrick Williams . It 's no secret . It 'll be on the morning news , along with pictures of this place . " He made a face . " WPRY wanted to interview me . I said hell no . Angela said the same . They wanted to know , did I have an explanation ? I said hell no to that , too . " <p> " Foo Manchu must have gotten him , " I suggested with my slightly goofy grin . <p> Kennedy looked at me thoughtfully for what seemed a long time and then , a slow smile spreading over his thin lips , said , " That 's what I told Angela . " <p> Angela smiled a little uncertainly ; I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humor . <p> When I got home , Mrs. Williams was sitting on the couch in tears . The TV was on and that was how she learned that the son she used to beat with both hands and a broomstick had had something much worse done to him . I gave her the day off with pay . I was sorry to see her in tears but I was glad that Derrick , now identified as the neighborhood burglar and the killer of Mrs. V , was gone . <p> A few nights later I woke up about three . After half an hour of inviting the rest that would n't come I got up and padded over to the bedroom window . I could see slantwise down into Kennedy 's yard . Of course there was all that shrubbery and the tricky light , but I could swear Foo Manchu was n't sitting in his accustomed place . It was like a childhood dream where things that are stable and solid in the daytime come to life after dark . <p> I had n't studied Latin for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back to me . Negotium perambulans in tenebris  --  the plague that walketh about in darkness . Only I was n't sure whether Foo Manchu represented the plague or the cure . <p> Next day I was horrified to see our mailman rattling the gate next door . I ran over and caught him just as he was about to stick a package in through the bars . <p> " Those folks keep a Rottweiler , " I told him . " You better not put your hand in there . If you 've got a package for them and they do n't answer the bell , better just leave it with me . " <p> " I figured it might be a Rottweiler yard , " said the mailman , a pleasant young black guy . " Somehow you get an instinct in this job . You know , people train them dogs not to bark . They just come at you . " <p> " Just come bite a chunk out of you , eh ? " <p> " Yeah . Over by Lurcher School , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pit bulls . Every goddamn body got him a pit bull . They feed ' era gunpowder to make ' em mean . Well , thanks for tellin ' me . " <p> So I took the package , and later in the day carried it over when I saw Kennedy 's blue Honda in the driveway . I rang the bell and he came marching down the garden path  --  I noticed he took regulation 30-inch steps even when strolling in his garden  --  and he thanked me and invited me in for coffee . <p> I followed him , edging past Foo Manchu . The garden was in even fuller blossom than before , and I told him , " You 've done astonishing things here . " <p> He disagreed politely , saying , " No , it was all Angela . She 's got a gift for making things live . " <p> Inside , he poured coffee into strong brown military mugs and we sat down on rigid Chinese furniture that conceded very little to the human form . Inevitably , we chatted about the Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's amazing what perfectly ordinary people will do in the right circumstances , " I said cautiously . " Especially in wartime . " <p> " I could tell you stories , " he said , but did n't at first . He drank his coffee and his little flat killer 's eyes , which seemed so unlike the rest of him , looked at things that were no longer there . <p> " I 'm thinking about it more , " he said at last . " Particularly at night . " <p> " I have insomnia too  --  " <p> " No , this is worse . I must be getting old . Sometimes it 's almost , well , hallucinations . " <p> Joe Barberino saw bugs and snakes , I thought suddenly . I looked at Kennedy sharply . Was something getting past the guardian at the gate , something that could n't be seen , bitten , or swallowed ? <p> " I smell old blood , " he said with difficulty . " You know how damn fool writers are always saying blood smells sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smells like sweat . A fleshy , sweaty smell . Well , I 'm smelling it in the dark , sometimes so strong it 's like being in a slaughterhouse . " <p> I told him my own little war story . " A truck I was riding in was blown up by a mine in the middle of Saigon , in the middle of the day . It happened near a market and a lot of people died , too . All I remember is the dust and the screaming and the smell of things burning before I blacked out . " <p> He nodded . " I suppose when you were over there you heard something about me , " he said . <p> " Something ... " <p> " I know there was talk about bringing charges . Maybe they were justified . Once I just stood back and let the boys go . I did n't know myself what they would do . We 'd had trouble with this village , and I thought , You goddamn gooks shoot us in the back , do you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys go . And later when I walked through the wreckage  --  just like you said , it 's incredible the things ordinary people will do in wartime . Mutilating children , sodomizing corpses . Things you would n't believe . " <p> He sighed . He sounded old and tired . The talk lightened up a bit after that and he showed me a couple of his scars where AK47 rounds had gone through him , and his left ear , which , when I examined it closely , turned out to be one of those sculpted ears that plastic surgeons make out of bits of living gristle to replace an ear that 's been lost . I had never noticed it before . <p> " That changed me , " he said . " After that I did n't love war so much . Come on , I 'll walk you to the gate . " <p> " Is that necessary ? " I asked . " Even though I 'm an invited guest ? " <p> " Well , it 's desirable . I mean , you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in its own strange way , and therefore somewhat unpredictable . " <p> That was the only time I ever heard him say straight out that Foo Manchu was something  --  well , something else . It was also the last time I ever heard Jim Kennedy say anything at all . <p> That night before I went to bed I checked to make sure that Foo Manchu was in his place  --  he was  --  the gate locked , and the lights on in the Kennedy house . Through the garden foliage I could just catch a glimpse of Jim 's white head and Angela 's dark one , apparently sitting in adjacent chairs in the flicker of a TV set . I went home to bed and I was well into my nightmare  --  smelling dust and fire and hearing people scream - when the phone woke me a little after four-thirty in the morning . <p> It was Angela and she was scared . Jim was having a heart attack or something ; anyway he could n't draw a good breath . She had called 911 , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in Vietnam and did I by any chance know CPR ? <p> I did , and within five minutes , clothes disordered , eyes gummy and mind still confused , I was at the gate and Angela was unlocking it for me . I kept enough presence of mind to take the key from her and lock it behind us before we started for the house . Kennedy was looking terrible ; I smelled the vomit before we reached the bedroom upstairs , and when I turned up the light and bent over him I could see that his swarthy face was bluish and contorted . He was unconscious . <p> I started CPR , dragging him down onto the floor to work better . No response . I could n't feel a heartbeat and he was n't breathing . I tasted vomit every time I forced air into his lungs . Pounding on his chest got no response ; he might have been a big , hard-bodied leather doll for all the good I was doing . The bell at the gate rang when I was a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pocket and ran downstairs . Almost instantaneously , it seemed , there were big young men at the door of the bedroom , and they were hustling and banging a metal litter inside . They had the electroshock gadget , the paddles , and a bottle of oxygen , and one was already poking a needle into a little vial , I suppose the stuff that dissolves bloodclots . <p> I moved aside for the pros , suddenly aware that an out-of-shape old geezer with a plate in his head has no business doing vigorous CPR unless he wants it done on him next . Gasping I sat absolutely still on the rumpled bed with head down while my breathing returned to normal . I was aware of the emergency team strapping Kennedy to the stretcher and then rushing him out , a plastic mask on his face and the oxygen bottle resting beside his head . Angela thanked me distractedly and said she was going along to the hospital , and please take care and thank you so much . And then I was alone in a very smelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had just begun to like had died . <p> After a while I became convinced that I was not about to follow Jim , not yet . Pulse got down under a hundred and my muscles stopped quivering . I got up and went to the bathroom and drank a little from a bottle of artesian water in a metal stand . Light was streaming in through a bullseye window . I became aware that the sun was almost up , that a summer day was beginning that birds were quarreling that squirrels were leaping and cavorting in branches . It all seemed very loud in comparison to the quiet that now permanently enshrouded Jim Kennedy , who had died  --  of what ? I wondered . A heart attack ? A hex ? <p> I made my way downstairs and out the front door , which swung to behind me and clicked . The garden rippled in a soft breeze . Suddenly I felt a small touch of apprehension . I could n't see Foo Manchu , unless a momentary flicker of red in the green maze might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked left and right , and the roof of my own house stood up , rising out of dense bamboo and dark yew and a summer thicket of thick-leaved Japanese magnolia . I turned back and tried the door ; it had locked automatically . <p> I started toward the property line but met a board fence nine feet high with new metal brackets nailed to the inside holding a coil of bright concertina wire . So after Derrick 's death , Kennedy had taken precautions to prevent anyone else from getting in . I had a strong feeling that the fences around the other sides of the property would be at least as strong and well guarded . Which meant I could n't get out . <p> I looked back . The house had six ground-floor windows facing me , and every window was barred , the bars secured by one-way screws of the type you ca n't get out without a lock wrench and a lot of patience . The house was perfectly silent . I knew that the path was the only way out of the yard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember feeling a kind of indignation  --  was n't I a legitimate visitor ? Had n't I tried to save its master ? <p> I started down the path . They can smell fear , I was thinking , and thinking also of an old Far Side cartoon with a dog testing visitors with a Fear-O-Meter . So I tried to disengage my mind , thinking of Mrs. Williams 's chatter , of duties to be done , of times gone by , of anything whatever except what I was doing , of the crunching gravel and the curve of the walk past the thick stand of banana trees and the pool with the fancy fish and the place by the gate where Foo Manchu stood , except that he was n't standing there anymore . The groundcover was crushed down where the statue had been , and the stems of the plants that had been underneath it were yellowish white but the lion-dog was gone . <p> And the gate was locked . Angela had locked it behind her , either forgetting about me or assuming I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she returned . I heard a moan and it was my own voice . As quietly as I could I began to shake the gate . God , how frustrating it was , looking through the bars at Azalea Place , quiet lawns , big wooden houses , a sprinkler turning lazily , not a sign of life anywhere . Then I heard something moving in the garden growth , a soft complaint of bending shrubbery and a rustle of leaves too concentrated to be the work of the wind . I turned and started to run back toward the house , a stupid thing to do , but I was in a panic now . <p> I had n't gone five steps when something the weight and solidity of Stone Mountain slammed into my back , breaking my left scapula with a brief blinding spark of pain and I fell , crushed down into the soft garden earth and lay there with my nose and mouth pressed into the tangle of stems , roots , and loam and tasting them all and waiting for death because life was over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beat rhythmically against the back of my neck and a couple of big teeth ripped my scalp and grated against the skull and squeaked on the metal plate . The blood spurted and the creature paused to lick my head with a huge wet tongue that was rough and sandpapery , like a lion 's . <p> Then it tried several holds , moving its jaws a little each time , mumbling my head to get a good grip before tearing it off . I guess I had now given up hope , because the terror ebbed . I felt a strange and growing calm . My mind entered a dissociated state , feeling that this was happening not to me but to a man I had known a long time and liked but who was , after all , only a mask worn by the real me and that I could look through many other masks , including the bulging eyes of Foo Manchu  --  and for a few seconds I did , staring down at my battered old body lying under the huge paws where the purple veins were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a calm certainty that soon the old guy would be dead and that it did not matter . He would pass into the lion-dog and share in its strange life of alternating immobility and violence , and that was all right , nature involved these endless transformations and the slain of today was the slayer of tomorrow . <p> The teeth shifted and clamped a little tighter and I was back inside my own body , waiting for death . And then without the slightest warning the weight and the gouging fangs vanished . I heard a tremendous crash that I thought at first was thunder . Foo Manchu was gone . My lungs expanded enormously and agonizing pains shot through my chest . I was lying all alone , gasping and sobbing in the garden that Angela Barberino had made for Jim Kennedy . <p> It was a long time before I could move at all . It was tough , returning to myself when I was nothing but a great mass of pain and blood and dirt . But very , very slowly I did manage to raise my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere , not even in his accustomed place inside the gate . My breath came more evenly ; for the second time that morning recuperation began . There was a great gap torn in the fence nearby , the concertina wire twisted and the thick boards shattered and the pieces flung around , some high into the trees . Slowly , wiping blood from my face , I crept through the gap into my own yard , emerging in a stand of banana trees that was swarming with flies and buzzing like a transformer . Beyond was my own green lawn . <p> I had reached the open when I saw something that almost made me collapse again . Not ten feet away was Foo Manchu , seated in his old posture of defiance just inside my gate and glaring through the bars at anybody who might dare to invade it . Incredulous at first , I slowly accepted the fact that he was there to protect me . Somehow or other he had become mine . <p> Yes , said Angela sadly , for a while it looked as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was some response , but then he died for good , even with an injection of adrenalin into the heart . The strange thing was , the autopsy did n't show any disease ; Jim had been a runner , careful of his weight , everything you 're supposed to be and do . The doctors were baffled . <p> " They do n't know everything , " I assured her . I was in pretty punk shape myself , what with the body cast and my head still wrapped in bandages . Besides the broken scapula I had a bunch of cracked ribs and a cracked vertebra . But I was back from the hospital and sitting in a motor wheelchair in my living room  --  really mine now , for I 'd just signed a contract to buy the house from Angela . My therapist had come and gone already , an energetic young black woman who , besides making me exercise my muscles , by her very presence dispensed great gulps of vitality and hope . <p> Angela was telling me now about Jim 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she thought she would stay there , because in spite of everything she had been happy there , most of her memories of the place were good ones . She told me how Jim had added a final codocil the night he died , leaving me Foo Manchu with the brief explanation that having been in Asia I would " know better than most others how to care for this unusual artwork . " <p> I 'd never thought of him as having a sense of humor ; now I recognized that he enjoyed a sly , dry joke . So at the instant of his death I had become the lion-dog 's master , and the creature had gone in a flicker from killing me to guarding my property . <p> I had played my assigned role in the farce that followed , attributing my injuries to a hit-and-run driver for whom the police were still hopelessly looking . Angela had not yet thought to ask me how Foo Manchu got to my property , and the therapist at my request had helped me cover the statue with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a handsome woman still , intelligent , unlucky , with nice breasts , and a streak of gray now showing in the dark mass of her hair , I was wondering if she might , in a little while , be open to comforting again as she had been once in the past , after Joe Barberino died . <p> " I 'm so glad you 're staying on in Azalea Place , " she said in a kindly tone , as if she had read my mind . <p> " I 've done my wandering . Besides , I feel I 've sort of paid my dues here and might as well stay . " <p> " I 'll never forget how you tried to save Jim 's life . I hope it 's all right if I come over now and then with chicken soup or something . " <p> " I wo n't recover unless you do , " I replied gallantly . " And now let me chug along with you , down to the gate . I want to ask you about the garden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm afraid it 's going straight to hell under my care . " <p> So she did , and I maneuvered my chair beside her , paying very little attention to what she said but luxuriating in her company and the extravagant energy of life all around me . When she was gone I locked my gate , turned my chair into a thicket of yellow jasmine and lifted the corner of the white dropcloth . For a few minutes I lingered in the spot , caressing Foo Manchu 's stony mane . The marble was incredibly beautiful , the most beautiful stone I ever saw , deep dark purple shot through with crimson veins in patterns so complex and mysterious I could have gazed at them entranced for hours , wondering what they meant or if they meant anything at all . <p> " I 'm glad you 're mine , " I told him . Especially glad because of the dreams I 'd been having , which had gotten more intense in the hospital , even with the drugs I was taking . Soon , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd be set to follow the others who had annoyed or insulted Mrs. DeSaye . Set for my own accident or heart attack or whatever else might come out of that lady 's dark universe , where nothing ever happened by chance . <p> I pulled down the cloth to hide Foo Manchu once again , and turned my chair . The little electric motor whined as I chugged back to the house . There I rang up Mrs. DeSaye and invited her to coffee . <p> " I 'm so sorry we had a misunderstanding a while back and I 'd like to do what I can to , uh , repair the breach , " I lied in my most sincere , diplomatic voice . Look , it comes naturally ; I was the CIA 's diplomatic liaison in Bucharest for five years . <p> " I have fresh macaroons and biscotti and some rather exciting news to tell you , " I went on , laying out bait in great thick chunks . " You can come ? Oh , that 's wonderful . Say about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought , hanging up . And then we 'll see . Godzilla versus King Kong . We 'll see who rules this jungle . Feeling the old , half-forgotten thrill of combat , I chugged into the kitchen to prepare the coffee and lay out the cakes . <p> <p> <p> By Albert E.
