When John Glenn became the first American to orbit Earth on Feb. 20 , 1962 , I was a pilot at the Naval Air Test Center in Patuxent River , Md . I tested planes like the F-4A Phantom Two and A-3J Vigilante that flew Mach 2 , twice the speed of sound . I thought I had the hottest job in the Navy-indeed , the world . I listened on the radio as the Atlas rocket successfully boosted Glenn 's Mercury capsule into space . Then I climbed into a Skyhawk for a short test hop . By the time I landed , Glenn was preparing to splash down in the Pacific after circling the planet three times . Quickly , I calculated that during the time it took me to fly 1,000 miles , Glenn went 36,000 ! I began to realize that somebody else might have a more interesting job . Later that year , when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration announced plans to hire more astronauts , I applied but was not selected . I applied again one year later , and NASA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to walk on the Moon . Yet , had someone asked me about space when I was a First Class Scout in Fort Worth , Tex. , 25 years earlier , I would n't have known what they meant . When I was growing up , airplanes were my great love . With my parents , I would visit the nearest airport to watch planes roar off into the sky . Their power and grace excited me . But I never dreamed of the much more explosive power of the Saturn V rocket that one day would hurl me to the Moon . Even less did I guess I might spend 59 days in space as commander of an orbiting laboratory known as Skylab Mission Two . Today 's Scouts have the opportunity to go even farther in space . The National Commission on Space predicts that someday we will not only complete a planned space station in Earth orbit , but return to the Moon to establish a lunar base . Mars also beckons . Someday , readers of this magazine may venture into the outer reaches of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to dream too big a dream . Living in Space The space station will become our first permanent settlement beyond Earth 's atmosphere . Crews will shuttle to and from Earth on a regular basis . They will live in more comfort than the Apollo astronauts did en route to the Moon , or our Skylab crew . Each crew member will have a private compartment for sleeping and relaxing . Food , packaged in individual containers , will be similar to that on the shuttle : dried meats , fruit and vegetables , but there 'll also be a freezer , so there may be ice cream too . Crew members will be able to shower , and engineers are designing washers and dryers to work in zero gravity . The lack of gravity on board will help scientists develop experimental metals , ceramics and crystals , all especially pure and with properties that ca n't be produced on Earth . At this point , we can barely imagine the potential of the space station . Some of the things we discovered in Skylab will help in planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the goal was living and working in space . In previous missions , the main goal was going somewhere for exploration . With my two crewmates , Jack Lousma and Owen Garriott , I spent 59 days in space performing experiments . Moon Base By the time in the 21st century that most of today 's Cub Scouts could have college degrees , we may have a lunar base . Wendell W. Mendell , who was with NASA 'S Solar System Exploration Division , suggested that Moon settlers eventually will grow their own food and will mine the Moon for minerals , including fuel to propel rockets farther into space . But in the more immediate future , in addition to pilots and scientists , NASA will need to recruit geographers , oceanographers , astronomers and medical doctors . " Unlike the space station , which must continuously be resupplied , " Mendell said , " the lunar base has the potential of being self-sufficient . " Mars and Beyond Meanwhile , we will send probes to Mars , its moons , the asteroid belt , the moons around Jupiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human and artificial intelligence to explore and perform tasks similar to those we did as astronauts during the Apollo program . Computer engineers and automation experts will be needed to design these machines . Man eventually will step onto the surface of Mars , but not merely to plant a flag and come back home . Mars is 49 million miles from Earth . Bridging this gap takes nine or more months ; the round trip is nearly two years . Beyond these great adventures , it is difficult to make reasonable guesses concerning our progress farther into the universe . Who knows what new tool science will offer us ? How to Get There From Here When I ventured into space , the only route was by learning to fly . As we explore space in the future , we will need pilots , technicians , scientists and probably people with jobs nobody has yet described . Those interested in space careers should first get a good education , says Joseph Loftus , assistant director of engineering at the Johnson Space Center . He recommends a college degree in science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps equally important is to have a desire to succeed in space . During my learning years , I never was the smartest student . After I joined the Navy , I never was the best pilot . But I tried hard , studied , worked to become better , because I loved what I was doing . I enjoyed the thrill of exploring the unknown . I have seen fellow pilots killed in crashes of experimental aircraft . Three astronauts died in a launch-pad fire during the Apollo program . Risk will always be a part of the dream of reaching farther into space . We were all jolted by this realization once again , Jan. 28 , 1986 , when the Challenger crew died in an explosion just after launch . Attempts to pioneer can sometimes be painful . But the pioneer spirit also leads to moments such as the one when Eagle Scout Neil A. Armstrong stepped onto the Moon , July 21,1969 , saying , " That 's one small step for a man and one giant leap for mankind . " Painting the Moon For many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon . Making that 240,000mile trip from Earth seemed like the ultimate " hill " for me to climb . When I got there , I was busy ! During the 31 hours Charles " Pete " Conrad Jr . and I spent on the surface , including seven hours outside our module , I had no time to perch on the edge of a crater and ponder the universe . Attached to my wrist was a checklist of tasks that had to be completed . If I have any regrets , it is that I did not take time , before falling asleep during my " night " on the Moon , to gaze out the window and make a watercolor sketch . Since returning to Earth and leaving the astronaut corps , I have tried to make up for that omission . I now work full time as an artistre-creating the sights I saw in space . Space is like an ocean whose farthest shore you can never reach . There is no limit to the challenges awaiting men and women who raise their eyes to focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . The dreamers among us will find countless opportunities for pursuing our goals . <p>
