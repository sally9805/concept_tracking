" Looking good " and " feeling good " are the keys to what 's happening today in nutrition and health . More and more people realize that we can look good , feel better , and live longer by eating healthy , losing weight , building muscle , reducing stress , improving digestion , fighting chronic disorders , and putting the brakes on aging . They 've seen how crisis-oriented drug therapy has failed us . The new emphasis is on " natural " ways , such as foods and food extracts , to achieve our health goals . * Eating Healthy People are turning from the medicine cabinet to the kitchen cupboard . There 's a growing population of " nutrition-literate " Americans who are making the connection between disease and diet . In fact , 60 percent of Americans have changed their eating habits to fight devastating conditions such as cancer , hypertension , heart disease , obesity or cholesterol . ( Shields , p. 99 ) According to Dr. A. Elizabeth Sloan ( President of Applied Biometrics , Inc. ) , as far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right actions they can prevent cancer , 44 percent agreed that foods can reduce the use of drugs , 64 percent agreed there is a connection between food and mood , plus 74 percent were highly aware of the diet/disease connection . Mother Nature is now the doctor . The term " fresh " is in , whether that be straight from the farm or in a can . In fact , according to a 1994 Fresh Trends Survey , " fresh " tops the list of most desired label claims and there is every reason this trend should continue in 1996 , says Dr. Sloan . What appears to have kick-started the " fresh " food rush is the recommendation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that we eat three to five servings of vegetables , and two to four servings of fruit per day . In addition , there is increasing evidence of the relationship between diet and cancer . And hey , who wants to get cancer ? But cardiovascular disease , diabetes , and other deadly chronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research shows that we really are what we eat ( and absorb ) . * Ethnic Foods and Enzymes As sure as the Atlanta Braves won the 1995 World Series , ethnic foods are " in . " The good news is that they titillate your taste buds with stimulating sauces and spicy ingredients . The bad news is that the digestive systems of many of us are not prepared for such exquisite , succulent delicacies . As a result , heart bum , gas and bloating can often occur  --  Jim Dandy Enzymes to the rescue ! Plop , plop  --  into the mouth . Those wondrous digestive enzymes can ease the disturbing results of gastronomic ethnic adventures . And Shazam ! all 's quiet on the Western Front ( and down the abused digestive tract , as well ) . Bring on the enzymes ! They 're our saviors. * Food Extracts With the U.S.D.A 's Food Pyramid poking through the stratosphere , the public will continue to crave fresh fruits and vegetables , replacing those juicy marbled slabs of succulent beef . But the decreasing ability to obtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump start " and " juice up " the food extract business . Food extracts are nutrients ( including phytochemicals  --  the chemicals naturally found in plants ) judiciously extracted from raw fruits , vegetables , and grains . As our comic strips are overflowing with superheros , health foods also have their " gang busters , " called phytochemicals , with such names as flavonoids , indoles , coumarins , and limonoids . These phytochemicals are common in vegetables , fruits and other plants . Some are thought to interfere with processes leading to cancer ; others seem to block receptor sites ( the landing pads ) for certain cancer-causing hormones ( for example , estrogen , which can encourage some breast cancer growth ) . Others can boost the body 's ability to fight cancer , and still others , such as aged garlic extract , are able to do all three . If these phytochemicals are present in whole foods , why take food extracts ? What 's the advantage over whole foods ? Good question ! For one reason , they 're better absorbed . Though absorption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is also unpredictable . Food extracts ( functional foods ) give the consumer the best of fresh foods in a more highly absorbable form . Therefore , emphasis will be placed on developing improved absorption methods for presently existing products , as well as the development of more readily absorbable new products . Remember , it 's not what you eat that counts , it 's what you absorb . You are what you absorb . A major way to achieve predictable absorption is to extract or fractionate a food ingredient and to formulate the extract fraction , or concentrate , into a new healthier food or supplement . Extraction also helps to reduce the microbial content of root vegetables , such as garlic , thus improving human safety . Aged garlic extract is an excellent example of this process . Throughout history , we 've known that certain foods have health-giving properties . The wisdom of the ages is now being validated by cold hard research . International companies are flocking to information-laden conferences ( including Designer Foods III at Georgetown University , Functional Foods for Health at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Orleans and NutraCon 1995 in Las Vegas ) . The buzz words are " functional ( or designer ) foods " and " phytochemicals . " For instance , at the Designer Foods III Conference , 40 scientists and researchers discussed updated research in the allium vegetables  --  especially garlic ( and aged garlic extract ) , licorice root extract , flax seed , and phytochemical substances derived from soy . In the future , store shelves will find an increasing number of " designee " or " functional " foods made from safe , standardized , and stable phytochemical fractions and developed to positively affect human metabolism and physiology in health and disease . A good example of a popular food extract is an exciting old-but-new green barley product from Japan that fights free radicals . This product is so powerful in its antioxidative effect that a spray version has been developed , tested , and patented which can extend the life of flowers from two or three days to approximately 30 days , depending on the flower . This action is due to the antioxidative activity of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-linking and free radical formation , green barley extract ( with 2-0-GIV ) is presently used in Japan to fight these signs of aging . Hopefully , a skin product will be available in America soon . * Super Foods Though individual supplements in tablet or pill form will continue to be popular , there is an increasing interest in bolstering our foods with vitamins and minerals . For example , many juices on the market have added nutrients , including calcium and vitamin C , so you can get your vitamins and minerals in your orange juice . Even milk is now available with fruit-flavored yogurt . In fact , vitamins , minerals and antioxidants are being added to everything from juice drinks to cookies and snacks . * Losing Weight The battle of the bulge continues its dominance , and with good reason . According to Dr. Sloan , only 19 percent of the American public is within the ideal weight range , and 25 percent of children are clinically obese . As Indiana Tones searches for hidden Indian treasures in the adventure movie The Temple of Doom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food extracts to the health-care-starved American public . One example is Garcinia cambogia and its extract hydroxycitric acid ( HCA ) from Southern Asia . HCA continues to be very popular in weight loss and appetite suppressant products . Combined with chromium and niacin , the products are also used to lower cholesterol . Further , a water-soluble potassium salt of hydroxycitric acid has been formed for broader applications , such as weight loss fruit drinks . * Building Muscle Whether a body builder , weight lifter , football player , cyclist or weekend warrior , most athletes want to have better endurance , more strength and more muscle mass . We know that exercise can break down muscle tissue protein . Many athletes take protein or amino acid supplements in an attempt to decrease the breakdown , while increasing the rebuilding of muscle tissue . But the muscle tissue proteins in our bodies are constantly breaking down and rebuilding  --  it 's part of normal , everyday life . In fact , according to one source , " about 17 percent of the energy your body uses at rest comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle tissue protein . " ( 1 ) Crystalline free-form amino acids and protein powders have been on the market for years . But the future holds new products that will provide better ways to absorb the amino acids we ingest , whatever their form . After all , it 's not enough to ensure adequate protein intake , we must also ensure adequate absorption of the nutrients we ingest . This could be another dynamic enzyme application . * Reducing Stress Implicated in everything from ulcers to heart attacks , stress is an ever-present part of life . According to Dr. Sloan , 65 percent of adults report feeling stressed on an everyday basis . She adds that in attempts to relax , Americans are turning toward aromatherapy products , home fragrances , meditative music , and massage products and services . In fact , according to Dr. Sloan , last year Americans spent more than $750 million on products formulated to keep their homes smelling sweet . They paid an additional $200 million for nontraditional home fragrances , such as scented natural oils that are vaporized in fragrance burners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatly influenced by free-radical formation , there will be an increased number of health products on the market containing free-radical fighters ( antioxidants ) , both in food and supplement forms . Further , since consumers and manufacturers are becoming increasingly aware of the fact that enzymes reduce in quantity and quality levels as we age , more anti-aging products will include enzymes in their formulations . * Improving Digestion To improve digestion and absorption , enzymes will be combined with food extracts . Further , more function-specific enzymes will be developed to overcome such problems as reduced enzyme production by the body , aging and sickness , as well as changes in digestive acidity and alkalinity. * How to Keep Fido Healthy One of the largest growing areas in health care does n't concern humans , but man 's ( and woman 's ) best friends . Let 's not forget our friendly feline or slurpy , cuddly canine . A quick trip to the health food or pet store shows things ai n't what they used to be ! The shelves are bursting with garlic to help fight fleas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones , green barley to perk up your panting pup , and just about anything else Fido fantasizes . If there 's something for the two-legged animal , you 're sure to see it for your four-legged friends  --  vitamins , minerals , enzymes , herbs  --  you name it . * Some Pinpointed Prognostications Health food companies will continue their unending quest to bring new health-giving and disease-fighting products to your home . In fact , more and more high rollers ( main-stream mega companies ) are seeing the value of health products and are throwing in their millions for search , research , and marketing of new products or revisions of old standards . Whatever the ultimate health goal , the emphasis seems to be on increased disease prevention and self-medication through foods , food extracts and supplements . Personal lifestyle and eating style will be the driving forces for health food trends , according to experts . In our never-ending quest for youth and health , we will continue to make dietary modifications . Dr. Cichoke is an internationally-known writer , lecturer , and researcher .
