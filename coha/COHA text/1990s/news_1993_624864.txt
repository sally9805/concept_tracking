<p> A chilling ordeal awaited 1st Lt. Ted Roggen and a dozen other captured American officers at a prisoner of war processing center at Luckenwalde , Germany , in 1943 . <p> Hoping to coerce their cooperation , their World War II Nazi captors clapped them into solitary confinement in dark , icy cold cells for nine days . <p> Thus they joined 90,000 Americans as German prisoners of war . <p> These POWs had much to endure  --  chronic food shortages , often over-crowded living quarters , boredom and frustration , periodic harassment , sometimes cruelty and some perilous cross-country marches as German forces retreated in the waning months of the war . <p> Unless U.S. servicemen fell into the clutches of the Gestapo or Schutzstaffel ( S.S. ) , they usually escaped barbaric treatment suffered by slave laborers or those sent to the Nazi death camps . <p> Unlike the Japanese , who regarded POWs as having lost all honor , the German military tended to show respect to prisoners and generally observe Geneva Convention guidelines for their treatment . <p> But the intelligence officer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to trickery . Oddly enough , he once had lived in Dallas and spoke flawless English . He identified himself as a Capt . Williams . <p> " " The ironic thing was that he knew more about my division ( the Texas National Guard 36th Division ) than I did , " said Roggen , now a veteran Houston public relations man . <p> " " When I would n't give him any information other than my name , rank and serial number as required by the Geneva Convention , " Roggen related , " " he said , " You fool ! Your comrades are leaving for a permanent camp , but you will remain in your cell . ' " <p> This was a bluff he also tried to pull on the other officers , who , like Roggen , had been captured shortly after the Allied invasion of Italy in September 1943 . Within minutes after these interrogations , all the prisoners were packed in a boxcar and shipped off to a camp at Szubin , Poland . <p> Roggen remembers how inmates at the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among them he spotted John T. Jones Jr. , whom he had known at Houston 's San Jacinto High School . <p> First Lt. Jones called out to him , " " What do you need ? " " " My nose was running from the cold , and I asked him if he had a handkerchief , " Roggen said . " " He pulled out a handkerchief , tore it in two and threw part of it over the fence to me . " <p> Jones was a tank platoon commander captured during the Battle of Kasserine Pass in North Africa in February 1943 . He explains that in the prison camps " " there was always a senior officer in charge , and we maintained a military organization and ran the camp just as we would in the field . " <p> " " We were so well-organized , " Jones said , " " we had people who prepared food , we had tailors , we had some of the best forgers you 've ever seen in your life . We had a research engineer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cigarette package , a paper clip and a piece of wire . " <p> With improvised radios the POWs were able to tune in British BBC newscasts and stay informed on how the war was going . <p> " " Thinking about an escape was part of your duty , " Jones said . " " Even if you did n't get very far , you would harass the Germans a little and require them to delegate more people to be guards . We had a lot of guys escape , but none stayed escaped . <p> " " We had one guy who later became an English professor who made it all the way down to Budapest in Hungary , trying to get to Yugoslavia . He could speak French and was masquerading as a French refugee . He got picked up in a spot check on the railroad because his fake passport was out of date . " Roggen helped conceal dirt from a tunnel prisoners were excavating for an escape attempt . The dirt was placed in empty Red Cross parcel boxes , then stashed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ground from a big outdoor privy caused the tunnel 's walls to start collapsing as it neared the barbed wire fence surrounding the camp , and that led the prisoners to abandon the project . <p> Escape attempts sometimes could provoke deadly German responses . In the secret diary he kept while at prison camp for Army Air Force officers at Sagan , Germany , 2nd Lt. Joel H.Tutt related how the Germans shot 50 British aviators involved in a mass escape attempt from a nearby camp . <p> First Lt. Anthony L.Vetrano served in an artillery battery of the 101st Airborne Division . He was captured Sept.18 , 1944 , during a disastrous attempt to outflank the Germans . A glider carrying him and his gun crew made a crash landing in the midst of a German unit behind enemy lines , between Eindhoven and Arnhem in the Netherlands . <p> After treatment for wounds , Vetrano , now a Houston lawyer , was sent to the same prison camp complex as Jones and Roggen . <p> " " One obnoxious corporal counted us every night with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to kill him . <p> " " One person who did n't keep his cool was our commanding officer , a bird colonel from the 101st Airborne . After he was given an office in the camp headquarters , he ordered his men to put up a pole outside the building . When the camp commandant asked him what the pole was for , he said , " As soon as the war 's over , I 'm going to hang you from it . ' " <p> The Germans repatriated him supposedly because of a bad liver , Vetrano said , " " but the true reason was because they were afraid of him . " Getting enough to eat was a universal concern of POWs . " " We were always afraid we would starve to death , " Jones remembered . <p> " " The food was n't very good , and there was n't a hell of a lot of it . But it was probably almost as good as what the German garrison got . What really saved us was the food in those Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a B-17 bombardier shot down over the Netherlands , wrote that prisoners " " talk , think and dream of foods . " He recalled the scene in the movie Gone With the Wind in which Scarlet O'Hara vowed she would never go hungry again . " " That is one thing I am inclined to agree with her , " wrote Tutt , who grew up in Montecello , Ga. , and now lives at Washington , Ga . <p> He made long lists of meats , vegetables and desserts from which he could someday as a free man make selections when he felt hungry . <p> Leon Wexler spent six months as a POW at the end of the war . <p> A supply sergeant for an engineer company in the 2nd Infantry Division , he fell into enemy hands in Belgium during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944 when a massive German offensive swept up thousands of American troops . <p> On Christmas Eve , he found himself jammed into one of numerous boxcars so filled with captured Americans that few if any could lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshaling yards in the German city of Cologne on the Rhine River , awaiting movement to a prison camp near Nuremberg in eastern Germany . <p> " " What made that night so memorable , " said Wexler , owner of a Houston jewelry company , " " was that all these boys were singing Christmas songs and at the same time our bombers were bombing the city . " <p> As the end of the war neared , the Germans marched Wexler 's detachment of POWs down to a camp near Munich in southern Germany , a movement which took weeks to complete . <p> Wexler said that one day outside the new camp he spotted " " all these people in striped outfits running down the road , and later I learned these were Jewish people escaping from a concentration camp that was nearby . " " " When our camp was liberated , tanks pulled into it , and Gen. <p> ( George ) Patton was in the lead tank , " Wexler said . " " He said get these ( expletive ) people out of here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes came in and started taking us off . " <p> Their shared experiences forged strong , lifelong ties for many POWs . Jones , former president of the Houston Chronicle and now board chairman of the Rusk Corporation , reflected , " " I made some of the best friends in my life . There is a common bond that holds us together . " <p> One friend was the late Amon Carter Jr. , also captured in North Africa shortly after Jones . Arabs who found him in the desert sold him to the Germans . That 's how the nephew of Jesse H.Jones , publisher of the Houston Chronicle , and the son of Amon Carter Sr. , publisher of the Fort Worth Star Telegram , came to be held in the same camp . <p> He and fellow survivors " " used to get together every other year , " Jones said . " " Now we get together every year while there are still some of us alive . " <p> TYPE : Series
