47 Testing , testing . One , two , three . Testing , testing . One , two , three . Maybe this is working . I do n't know . If you can even hear me , I do n't know . But if you can hear me , listen . And if you 're listening , then what you 've found is the story of everything that went wrong . This is what you 'd call the flight recorder of Flight 2039 . The black box , people call it , even though it 's orange , and on the inside is a loop of wire that 's the permanent record of all that 's left . What you 've found is the story of what happened . And go ahead . You can heat this wire to white-hot , and it will still tell you the exact same story . Testing , testing . One , two , three . And if you 're listening , you should know right off the bat the passengers are at home , safe . The passengers , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrides Islands . Then , after it was just him and me back in the air , the pilot parachuted out over somewhere . Some kind of water . What you 'd call an ocean . I 'm going to keep saying it , but it 's true . I 'm not a murderer . And I 'm alone up here . The Flying Dutchman . And if you 're listening to this , you should know that I 'm alone in the cockpit of Flight 2039 with a whole crowd of those little childsized bottles of mostly dead vodka and gin lined up on the place you sit at against the front windows , the instrument panel . In the cabin , the little trays of everybody'sChicken Kiev or Beef Stroganoff entres are half eaten with the air conditioner cleaning up any leftover food smell . Magazines are still open to where people were reading . With all the seats empty , you could pretend everyone 's just gone to the bathroom . Out of the plastic stereo headsets you can hear a little hum of prerecorded music . Up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Boeing 747-400 time capsule with two hundred leftover chocolate cake desserts and an upstairs piano bar which I can just walk up to on the spiral staircase and mix myself another little drink . God forbid I should bore you with all the details , but I 'm on autopilot up here until we run out of gas . Flame out , the pilot calls it . One engine at a time , each engine will flame out , he said . He wanted me to know just what to expect . Then he went on to bore me with a lot of details about jet engines , the venturi effect , increasing lift by increasing camber with the flaps , and how after all four engines flame out the plane will turn into a 450,000-pound glider . Then since the autopilot will have it trimmed out to fly in a straight line , the glider will begin what the pilot calls a controlled descent . That kind of a descent , I tell him , would be nice for a change . You just do n't know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pilot still had on his nothing special blah-colored uniform that looked designed by an engineer . Except for this , he was really helpful . More helpful than I 'd be with someone holding a pistol to my head and asking about how much fuel was left and how far would it get us . He told me how I could get the plane back up to cruising altitude after he 'd parachuted out over the ocean . And he told me all about the flight recorder . The four engines are numbered one through four , left to right . The last part of the controlled descent will be a nosedive into the ground . This he calls the terminal phase of the descent , where you 're going thirty-two feet per second straight at the ground . This he calls terminal velocity , the speed where objects of equal mass all travel at the same speed . Then he slows everything down with a lot of details about Newtonian physics and the Tower of Pisa . He says , " Do n't quote me on any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been tested . " He says the APU , the Auxiliary Power Unit , will keep generating electricity right up to the moment the plane hits the ground . You 'll have air-conditioning and stereo music , he says , for as long as you can feel anything . The last time I felt anything , I tell him , was a ways back . About a year ago . Top priority for me is getting him off this plane so I can finally set down my gun . I 've clenched this gun so long I 've lost all feeling . What you forget when you 're planning a hijack by yourself is somewhere along the line , you might need to neglect your hostages just long enough so you can use the bathroom . Before we touched down in Port Vila , I was running all over the cabin with my gun , trying to get the passengers and crew fed . Did they need a fresh drink ? Who needed a pillow ? Which did they prefer , I was asking everybody , the chicken or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the only skill where I really excel . The problem was all this meal service and rushing around had to be one-handed , of course , since I had to keep ahold of the gun . When we were on the ground and the passengers and crew were deplaning , I stood at the forward cabin door and said , I 'm sorry . I apologize for any inconvenience . Please have a safe and enjoyable trip and thank you for flying Blah-Blah Airlines . When it was just the pilot and me left on board , we took off again . The pilot , just before he jumps , he tells me how when each engine fails , an alarm will announce Flame Out in Engine Number One or Three or whichever , over and over . After all the engines are gone , the only way to keep flying will be to keep the nose up . You just pull back on the steering wheel . The yoke , he calls it . To move what he calls the elevators in the tail . You 'll lose speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a choice , speed or height , but either way you 're still going to nose-dive into the ground . That 's enough , I tell him , I 'm not getting what you 'd call a pilot 's license . I just need to use the toilet like nobody 's business . I just want him out that door . Then we slow to 175 knots . Not to bore you with the details , but we drop to under 10,000 feet and pull open the forward cabin door . Then the pilot 's gone , and even before I shut the cabin door , I stand at the edge of the doorway and take a leak after him . Nothing in my life has ever felt that good . If Sir Isaac Newton was right , this would n't be a problem for the pilot on his way down . So now I 'm flying west on autopilot at mach 0.83 or 455 miles per hour , true airspeed , and at this speed and latitude the sun is stuck in one place all the time . Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cruising altitude of 39,000 feet , over the Pacific Ocean , flying toward disaster , toward Australia , toward the end of my life story , straight line southwest until all four engines flame out . Testing , testing . One , two , three . One more time , you 're listening to the flight recorder of Flight 2039 . And at this altitude , listen , and at this speed , with the plane empty , the pilot says there are six or maybe seven hours of fuel left . So I 'll try to make this quick . The flight recorder will record my every word in the cockpit . And my story wo n't get bashed into a zillion bloody shreds and then burned with a thousand tons of burning jet . And after the plane wrecks , people will hunt down the flight recorder . And my story will survive . Testing , testing . One , two , three . It was just before the pilot jumped , with the cabin door pulled inside and the military ships shadowing us , with the invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engines shrieking and the air howling past , the pilot stood there in his parachute and yelled , " So why do you want to die so bad ? " And I yelled back for him to be sure and listen to the tape . " Then remember , " he yelled . " You have only a few hours . And remember , " he yelled , " you do n't know exactly when the fuel will run out . There 's always the chance you could die right in the middle of your life story . " And I yelled , So what else is new ? And , Tell me something I do n't know . And the pilot jumped . I took a leak , then I pushed the cabin door back into place . In the cockpit , I push the throttle forward and pull the yoke back until we fly high enough . All that 's left to do is press the button and the autopilot takes charge . That brings us back to right here . So if you 're listening to this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go look and see where this plane ended its terminal descent and what 's left . You 'll know I 'm not a pilot after you see the mess and the crater . If you 're listening to this , you know that I 'm dead . And I have a few hours to tell my story here . So I figure there 's maybe a chance I 'll get this story right . Testing , testing . One , two , three . The sky is blue and righteous in every direction . The sun is total and burning and just right there in front . We 're on top of the clouds , and this is a beautiful day forever . So let 's us take it from the top . Let me start at the start . Flight 2039 , here 's what really happened . Take one . And . Just for the record , how I feel right now is very terrific . And . I 've already wasted ten minutes . And . Action . Chapter Two 46 The way I live , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's different ; it 's fish or chicken . But the minute my one hand is covered in raw egg and the other 's holding the meat someone is going to call me in trouble . This is almost every night of my life now . Tonight , a girl calls me from inside a pounding dance club . Her only words I can make out are " behind . " She says , " asshole . " She says what could be " muffin " or " nothing . " The fact of the matter is you ca n't begin to fill in the blanks so I 'm in the kitchen , alone and yelling to be heard over the dance mix wherever . She sounds young and worn out , so I ask if she 'll trust me . Is she tired of hurting ? I ask if there 's only one way to end her pain , will she do it ? My goldfish is swimming around all excited inside the fishbowl on the fridge so I reach up and drop a Valium in its water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough ? I 'm yelling : I 'm not going to stand here and listen to her complain . To stand here and try to fix her life is just a big waste of time . People do n't want their lives fixed . Nobody wants their problems solved . Their dramas . Their distractions . Their stories resolved . Their messes cleaned up . Because what would they have left ? Just the big scary unknown . Most people who call me already know what they want . Some want to die but are just looking for my permission . Some want to die and just need a little encouragement . A little push . Someone bent on suicide wo n't have much sense of humor left . One wrong word , and they 're an obituary the next week . Most of the calls I get , I 'm only half listening anyway . Most of the people , I decide who lives and who dies just by the tone of their voice . This is getting nowhere with the girl at the dance club so I tell her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Kill yourself . She 's saying , " What . &gt; " Try barbiturates and alcohol with your head inside a dry cleaning bag . She says , " What ? " You can not bread a veal cutlet and do a good job with only one hand so I tell her , now or never . Pull the trigger or do n't . I 'm with her right now . She 's not going to die alone , but I do n't have all night . What sounds like part of the dance mix is her starting to cry really hard . So I hang up . On top of breading a veal cutlet , these people want me to straighten their whole life out . The phone in my one hand , I 'm trying to get bread crumbs to stick with my other . Nothing should be this hard . You flop the cutlet in raw egg . Then you shake it dry , then crumbs . The problem with the cutlet is I ca n't get the crumbs right . Some places , the cutlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places you ca n't tell what 's inside . It used to be this was a lot of fun . People just call you on the verge of suicide . Women would call . Here I am just alone with my goldfish , alone in my dirty kitchen breading a pork chop or whatnot , wearing just my boxers , hearing somebody 's prayer . Dishing out guidance and punishment . A guy will call . After I 'm fast asleep , it happens . These calls will come all night if I do n't unplug the phone . Some loser will call tonight just after the bars close to say he 's sitting cross-legged on the floor in his apartment . He ca n't sleep without having these terrible nightmares . In his dreams , he sees planes full of people crash . It 's so real and then no one will help him . He ca n't sleep . He ca n't get help . He tells me he 's got a rifle tucked up under his chin and he wants me to give him one good reason not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing the future and not being able to save anyone . These victims , they call . These chronic sufferers . They call . They break up my own little tedium . It 's better than television . I tell him , Go ahead . I 'm only half awake . It 's three in the morning , and I have to work tomorrow . I tell him , Hurry before I fall back asleep , pull the trigger . I tell him this is n't such a beautiful world that he has to stay in it and suffer . This is n't much of a world at all . My job is most of the time I work for a housecleaning service . Full-time drudge . Part-time god . Past experience tells me to hold the phone a ways from my ear when I hear the little click of the trigger . There 's the blast , just a burst of static , and somewhere a receiver clunks to the floor . I 'm the last person to talk to him , and I 'm back asleep before the ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obituary to look for the next week , six column inches about nothing that really mattered . You need the obituary , otherwise you 're not sure if it happened or if it was just a dream . I do n't expect you to understand . It 's a different kind of entertainment . It 's a rush , having that kind of control . The guy with the shotgun was named Trevor Hollis in his obituary , and finding out he was a real person feels wonderful . It 's murder , but it 's not , depending on how much credit you take . I ca n't even say doing crisis intervention was my own idea . The truth is this is a terrible world , and I ended his suffering . The idea came by accident when a newspaper did a feature about a real crisis hotline . The phone number in the paper was mine by mistake . It was a typo . Nobody read the correction they ran the next day , and people just started calling me day and night with their problems . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be or not to be , I do n't labor the decision . And do n't think I 'm above talking to women this way . Vulnerable women . Emotional cripples . McDonald 's almost hired me one time , and I only applied for the job to meet younger girls . Black girls , Hispanic , white , and Chinese girls , it says right on the job application how McDonald 's hires different races and ethnic backgrounds . It 's girls , girls , girls , buffet-style . Also on the application McDonald 's says if you have any of the following diseases : Hepatitis A Salmonella Shigella Staphylococcus Giardia or Campylobacter , then you may not work there . This is more of a guarantee than you get meeting girls on the street . You ca n't be too careful . At least at McDonald 's she 's gone on the record saying she 's clean . Plus , there 's a very good chance she 's going to be young . Pimple young . Giggling young . Silly young and as stupid as me . Eighteen- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to them . Community college girls . High school seniors . Emancipated minors . It 's the same with these suicide girls calling me up . Most of them are so young . Crying with their hair wet down in the rain at a public telephone , they call me to the rescue . Curled in a ball alone in bed for days , they call me . Messiah . They call me . Savior . They sniff and choke and tell me what I ask for in every little detail . It 's so perfect some nights to hear them in the dark . The girl will just trust me . The phone in my one hand , I can imagine my other hand is her . It 's not that I want to get married . I admire guys who can commit to a tattoo . After the newspaper got the phone number right , the calls started to peter out . The loads of people who called me at first , they were all dead or pissed off at me . No new people were calling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made a bunch of big sticky labels . The labels had to stand out . You need the stickers to be easy to read at night and by somebody crying on drugs or drunk . The stickers I use are just black on white with the black letters saying : Give Yourself , Your Life , Just One More Chance . Call Me for Help . Then my phone number . My second choice was : If You 're a Young Sexually Irresponsible Girl with a Drinking Problem , Get the Help You Need . Calland then my phone number . Take my word for it . Do n't make this second kind of sticker . With this kind of sticker , someone from the police will pay you a visit . Just from your phone number , they can use a reverse directory and put your name on a list as a probable felon . Forever after that you 'll hear the little click ... click ... click ... of a wiretap behind every telephone call you ever make . Take my word for it . If you use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling to confess sins , complain , ask advice , seek approval . The girls you meet are never very far from their worst-case scenario . A harem of women will be clutching their telephones on the brink and asking you to call back , please , call back . Please . Call me a sexual predator , but when I think of predators I think of lions , tigers , big cats , sharks . This is n't so much a predator versus prey relationship . This is n't a scavenger , a vulture , or a laughing hyena versus a carcass . This is n't a parasite versus a host . We 're all miserable together . It 's the opposite of a victimless crime . What 's most important is you need to put the stickers in public telephones . Try inside dirty phone booths near bridges over deep water . Put them next to taverns where people with no place to go get thrown out at closing time . In no time at all , you 'll be in business . You 'll need one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside somewhere . Then people will call in crisis and hear you flush the toilet . They 'll hear the roar of the blender and know how you could n't care less . These days , what I need is one of those cordless telephone headsets . A kind of Walkman of human misery . Live or die . Sex or death . This way , you can make hands-free life-and-death decisions every hour when people call to talk about their one terrible crime . You give out penance . You sentence people . You give guys on the edge the phone numbers of girls in the same position . The same as most prayers , the bulk of what you hear is complaints and demands . Help me . Hear me . Lead me . Forgive me . The phone is ringing again already . The thin little coating of crumbs on the veal cutlet is almost impossible for me to get right , and on the phone is a new girl , crying . I ask right away if she 'll trust me . I ask if she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us are just here swimming in one place . The cutlet looks dug out of a cat box . To calm this girl down , to get her to listen , I tell her the story about my fish . This is fish number six hundred and forty-one in a lifetime of goldfish . My parents bought me the first one to teach me about loving and caring for another living breathing creature of God . Six hundred and forty fish later , the only thing I know is everything you love will die . The first time you meet that someone special , you can count on them one day being dead and in the ground . Chapter Three 45 The night before I left home , my big brother told me everything he knew about the outside world . In the outside world , he said , women had the power to change the color of their hair . And their eyes . And their lips . We were on the back porch in just the light from the kitchen window . My brother , Adam , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handfuls of it and cutting it with a straight razor at about the halfway point . He 'd pinch my chin between his thumb and forefinger and force me to look at him straight on , his brown eyes darting back and forth between each of my sideburns . To get my sideburns even , he 'd cut one , then the other , then the first , over and over until both sideburns were gone . My seven little brothers were sitting along the edges of the porch , watching the darkness for all the evils Adam described . In the outside world , he said , people kept birds inside their houses . He 'd seen it . Adam had been outside the church district colony just one time , when he and his wife had to register their marriage to make it legal with the government . In the outside world , he said , people were visited in their houses by spirits they called television . Spirits spoke to people through what they called the radio . People used what they called a telephone because they hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . He went on cutting my hair , not for style as much as he was pruning it the way he 'd prune a tree . Around us on the porch boards , the hair piled up , not so much cut as harvested . In the church district colony , we hung bags of cut hair in the orchard to scare away deer . Adam told me the rule about not wasting anything is one of the blessings you give up when you leave the church colony . The hardest blessing you give up is silence . In the outside world , he told me , there was no real silence . Not the fake silence you get when you plug your ears so you hear nothing but your heart , but real out-of-doors silence . The week they were married , he and Biddy Gleason rode in a bus from the church district colony , escorted by a church elder . The whole trip , the bus was loud inside . The automobiles on the road with them were roaring . People in the outside world said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk their radios filled the gap with the copied voices of people singing the same songs over and over . Adam said the other blessing you have to give up in the outside world is darkness . You can close your eyes , and sit in a cupboard , but that 's not the same thing . The darkness at night in the church district colony is complete . The stars are thick above us in this kind of darkness . You can see how the moon is rough with mountain ranges and etched with rivers and smoothed with oceans . On a night without the moon or stars you ca n't see a thing , but you can imagine anything . At least that 's how I remember . My mother was inside the kitchen ironing and folding the clothes I 'd be allowed to take with me . My father was I do n't know where . I 'd never see either of them again . It 's funny , but people always ask if she was crying . They ask if my father cried and threw his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always amazed when I say no . Nobody cried or hugged . Nobody cried or hugged when we sold a pig either . Nobody cried and hugged before they killed a chicken or picked an apple . Nobody lay awake at night wondering if the wheat they 'd raised was truly happy and fulfilled being made into bread . My brother was just cutting my hair . My mother was just done ironing and she 'd sat down to sew . She was pregnant . I remember she was always pregnant , and my sisters were all around her with their skirts spread on the kitchen benches or on the floor , all of them sewing . People always ask if I was scared or excited or what . According to church doctrine only the firstborn son , Adam , would ever marry and grow old in the church district . When we turned seventeen the rest of us , me and my seven brothers and five sisters , would all go out for work . My father lives here because he was the firstborn son in his family . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father . People are always so disappointed if I tell them the truth , that none of us lived in oppressed turmoil . None of us resented the church . We just lived . None of us were tortured by feelings very much . That was the complete depth of our faith . Call it shallow or deep . There was nothing that could scare us . That 's how people raised in the church district colony believed . Whatever happened in the world was a decree from God . A task to be completed . Any crying or joy just got in the way of your being useful . Any emotion was decadent . Anticipation or regret was a silly extra . A luxury . That was the definition of our faith . Nothing was to be known . Anything was to be expected . In the outside world , Adam said it was a bargain with the devil that powered automobiles and carried airplanes across the sky . Evil flowed through electric wires to make people lazy . People put their dishes back in the cupboard dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away their garbage and shit so that it was someone else 's problem . Adam pinched my chin with his thumb and forefinger and leaned down to look me straight in the face , and said how in the outside world , people looked in mirrors . Right in front of him on the bus , he said , people had mirrors and everyone was busy seeing how they looked . It was shameful . I remember that was the last haircut I got for a long long time , but I do n't really remember why . My head was a bristling field of straw with just the short hairs that were left . In the outside world , Adam said , all the counting was done inside machines . All the food was fed to people by waitresses . The one time he left the colony , my brother and his wife and the church elder who escorted them stayed overnight in a hotel in downtown Robinsville , Nebraska . They did n't any of them sleep . The next day the bus brought them home for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was a big house where a lot of people lived and ate and slept , but no one knew each other . He said that described most families in the outside world . Churches in the outside world , my brother told me , were just the local stores that sold people lies made up in the distant factories of giant religions . He said a lot more I do n't remember . That haircut was sixteen years ago . My father had sired Adam and me and all fourteen of his children by the time he was the age I am now . I was seventeen years old the night I left home . The way my father looked the last time I saw him is the way I look now . Looking at Adam was as good as looking in a mirror . He was my big brother by just three minutes and thirty seconds , but in the Creedish church district there was no such thing as twins . That last night I ever saw Adam Branson , I remember thinking my big brother was a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid I was .
