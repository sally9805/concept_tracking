<p> BROOKSHIRE - Bob Rod 's resume is a head-spinner : stock broker , appliance manufacturer , oilman , banker , investment manager , real estate investor , rancher , world traveler , big game hunter . <p> Who would 've thought he 'd make his biggest mark - so far , anyway - as a potato chip tycoon ? <p> Rod sure did n't . <p> The founder , president and chairman of Bob 's Texas Style Chips of Brookshire was n't too keen on a snack food future when he set out a decade ago : " " I just wanted to salvage an investment of mine , " he says . <p> He 's done that and more . His future in potato chips - and tortilla chips and picante sauce and pork skins - is hot as the vats of peanut oil simmering in the cookers at his factory on FM 529 north of town . <p> Only trouble is , he 's got that itch again . It 's time for something new . What next and when ? <p> " " Exotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says with a schoolboy grin . " " I think that 's where I 'm headed . I want to be out raising animals . But right now , I 'm having too much fun with this . " <p> For Rod , 52 , married with two grown children , fun figures large in his life nowadays . The way he sees it , there 's no fun like entrepreneurial fun . <p> But fun - let alone , success - did n't seem likely when he dived into potato chips a decade ago . His forte had been banking and investment . <p> However , when money troubles hit a small potato-chip company leasing a building from him here , well , one thing led to another . <p> " " They were a group of investors who came here in the ( 1980s ) boom to produce kettle-fried potato chips on a small scale , " he explained . <p> Coming from a nonfood business background , they had used up their working capital in just six months . Rod and other minority investors bought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> " " I guess I knew about as much about potato chips as ( the founders ) did - which was not much , except that I sure liked to eat ' em ! " <p> But Rod knew something else : The right product at the right price at the right time , plus careful management , usually succeeds . <p> He figured that if his fledgling company could mass-produce the kind of thicker , darker chips that his Czech grandparents used to make on the stove at their farmhouse near El Campo , people would buy them . <p> His boyhood memories and marketing instincts were on the mark . <p> From a tiny 10-employee operation that in 1986 was producing about 20,000 bags a day of what Rod dubbed " " Texas Style Chips , " Bob 's has grown to a 42-employee enterprise that cranks out at least 30,000 bags of chips daily , plus other snack products like tortilla chips and pork skins . <p> Long since relocated from its original building here to bigger quarters about 10 minutes ' drive to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a handful of local grocery stores into 90 percent of major supermarkets across South and Southeast Texas . <p> Mail and phone orders come in from across the United States and Canada , and the company may start direct sales from its plant , Rod says . <p> As it is , the plant is seldom idle . Almost any day of the week will find a potato-laden semi-trailer or two at the freight dock , with a mini-front loader scooting between truck and warehouse with fresh spuds . <p> " " They 're raised as ' chipping ' potatoes , " Rod says . " " We get them from producers all the way from South Texas to North Dakota . Early in the year , the harvest starts to the south and goes north through the fall . " <p> Indeed , it 's now early December and the truck being unloaded this day is from North Dakota . The driver sits in his rig and waits for his 44,000-pound cargo to be hauled away , scoop by scoop , before heading north again . <p> The golden-brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before going onto the production line that starts next door . <p> Once on line , any given batch of potatoes will need a scant 15 minutes to be washed , sliced , cooked , seasoned , bagged and boxed . When things are really moving , the packaged chips still may be warm when they leave by truck for Bob 's distribution warehouse near the Astrodome . <p> Automated efficiency is n't the only change Rod brought to his company . Without a marketing plan , economies of scale in production mean little . <p> Early on , Rod determined not to try to muscle in on the mainstream salty snack market easily dominated by gigantic Frito-Lay of Dallas . Instead , he aimed at a niche market - upscale snack-buyers , potato-chip connoisseurs . <p> " " They recognize the difference that we use peanut oil , which is unhydrogenized and more flavorful , rather than soybean or some other oil " that 's hydrogenized ( for longer product shelf life ) but bland . <p> Such customers also are lured by Bob 's flavor-of-the-month products , which these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheese-jalapeno , cheese-onion , salt-and-vinegar , honey-mustard , ( not so ) hot barbecue and regular cheese . <p> Lastly , there 's " " cow chip , " the tongue-in-cheek label Rod slapped on his charcoaled-beef flavor that Bob 's sells during rodeo season . <p> The specialities each get a 60-day marketing window , then leave the product mix for 120 days before returning for another 60 days . <p> Bob 's mainstay , year-round flavors include salted , no-salt , jalapena , mesquite barbecue and hot ranch . <p> " " Some of the flavors-of-the-month may become regulars , " Rod says . " " We get calls from customers all the time . " <p> Most of the variations are the work of Rod 's production and purchasing manager , David Beauchamp of Katy , who reckons his seasoning skills are mostly " " common sense with a little imagination mixed in . " <p> " " All we do is cook them like we did way back when , " he says modestly , only reluctantly ' fessing up to having been always " " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grocery shelves , are others planned ? Rod is coy : " " Maybe deep-fried turkeys . Maybe something else . " <p> The future for Bob 's will be shaped by Rod 's entrepreneurial itch - the one that led him from stock trading in Houston back in 1967 , through manufacturing and oil and banking , to chips and dips today . <p> That interest in exotic game is n't idle . <p> On his South Texas ranch near Dilley , he 's raising them already . In particular , the low-cholesterol meat from elk is gaining popularity , and Rod says producers are racing to build herds . He aims to supply them . <p> Still , no big changes loom just yet for Bob 's Texas Style Chips . Rod hints at a public stock offering and suggests that his office manager - 24- year- old daughter Michelle Beauchamp ( she 's the production manager 's daughter-in-law ) - might run things someday . <p> But overall he 's pretty happy with the status quo : <p> " " I 'm having a damn good time . I 'd imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be having as much fun . This has turned out way better than I anticipated back in 1985 . " <p> There 's only one real drawback - temptation . He admits that the urge to sample the product , hot off the production line , is unending .
