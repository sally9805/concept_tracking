Bill Laswell , prominent producer of the global synthesis of popular styles currently referred to as " world music , " expresses deep admiration for people like the intrepid Fahnestock brothers . In the 1930s , the American Museum of Natural History engaged Bruce and Sheridan Fahnestock to collect insect and bird specimens in the South Pacific . Traveling aboard their 65-foot schooner , the Fahnestocks also began to document the indigenous music of the area . Overcoming a shipwreck and near-impossible sound conditions , the brothers managed to make what are believed to be the first recordings of Indonesian gamelan ensembles , featuring gongs , bamboo xylophones , and various other instruments . They continued their project until 1942 , when Bruce Fahnestock was killed by an American fighter plane that mistook his ship for a Japanese vessel and destroyed it . " That 's incredible , " says Laswell , standing in the no-frills front room of his studio on Greenpoint Avenue , a bustling thoroughfare in the Polish section of Brooklyn . " But things are different now . The world is different . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this music , put a frame around it , and stick it in a museum . ... I 'm not saying indigenous music is n't important and , wherever it still exists , that it should n't be preserved as much as possible . It 's just that I think of myself as a participant . To me , what people call world music right now , for better or worse , is a kind of global street sound . An ongoing thing . You ca n't stop that any place and make sense of it , because it does n't stop . " Collaboration between rock or jazz-based musicians and performers from other cultures is nothing new . Charlie Parker worked with Machito and other Cuban jazz stars to create an entire genre of Afro-Cuban jazz . And who can forget the bemused look on Ravi Shankar 's face as he watched George Harrison struggle to control the sitar ? But in the multicultural eighties and nineties , there has been a boomlet of what is often referred to as the " cross-pollination " of global pop styles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own label , Luaka Bop , which has produced several interesting compilations of primarily South American pop . The recent Telling Stories to the Sea  --  a sampler of Portuguese language material from Angola , Cape Verde , Sao Tome , and Portugal  --  is especially good . While Byrne performs on these records only occasionally , other American pop stars have taken a more active approach . Ry Cooder , the guitarist , won a Grammy for Talking Timbuktu , his stunning collaboration with Mali 's formidable Ali Farke Toure . More commercially imposing , and controversial at the time , was Paul Simon 's Graceland . Years after the fall of apartheid , South Africans are still arguing whether Simon 's work with the Zulu choral group Ladysmith Black Mambazo and others was an unforgivable violation of the cultural boycott then in effect . Of these globally expansive artists , however , none has worked as closely , consistently , or successfully with as widely disparate members of the world music community as has Bill as well . A fascinating and underappreciated figure in late-twentieth-century pop , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of polyglot hipsterism . Laswell first made a name for himself in New York 's downtown avant-garde scene , where he played with everyone from hip-hop inventor Afrika Bambaataa to Sex Pistol Johnny Rotten . Bill as well broke through to commercial visibility in 1983 with his seminal production of former Miles Davis pianist Herbie Hancock 's Future Shock , which included the jazz fusion hit " Rockit . " After subsequent productions for people like Whitney Houston and Mick Jagger , Laswell appeared to be on his way to an extremely comfortable career in the mainstream record industry . While not shunning such high-profile work , Laswell , now 41 , universalist in his passions and prolific , has continued what he calls " a life project " of playing with , and producing commercial recordings of , musicians from the various pop traditions throughout the world . " Sometimes I go there , sometimes they come here , " he says . Laswell is dressed in downtown all black , his habitual attire . On the wall behind him are the covers of the CDs recorded at the Greenpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Musa Suso ; " Shabeesation , " a fabulous record by the Moroccan Aisha Kandisha 's Jarring Effects ; The Trance of Seven Colors , a collaboration between jazz saxophonist Pharaoh Sanders and Moroccan Gnawa drummers and singers ; CDs by Manu Dibango from Cameroon ; Hooked Light Rays , a trance recording by Tibetan monks ; and many more . Travel is key to Laswell 's agenda . A man with many frequent-flier miles , he 's journeyed through the Asian steppe playing with Mongolian groups and has gone to China and Japan . While some people go sightseeing , Laswell goes " soundseeing But even as he prepares to venture to the Gambia , Senegal , and Guinea-Bissau to play with and record local artists , he points out that in some ways it does n't even matter where the music is actually done . " I 'm not going to say the results are going to be the same as they would be in Brooklyn . But what we 're doing is more of a two-way street . When you play with someone , no matter what their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . We 're making music , not culture . ... Someone like Suso , or Fela Fela Anikulapo Kuti , the activist Nigerian saxophonist and singer , they 're from Gambia , Lagos , wherever , and I 'm a bass player from Michigan . That 's not going to change . You are who you are ; that 's what makes it interesting . But when you sit down to play together , the hope is that you 're going to end up some place totally different . And that place belongs to us alone , because we created it . " For Laswell , who says he has such a " bad memory for details , places , and dates that I forget what country I 'm in , " this locale outside temporal definitions of race , time , and culture is where he wants to go . It is the basis of his " nonanthropologist " stance . " I 'm looking for the meeting point . That 's why we try to establish a long-term musical relationship . I 've been playing with Foday Musa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while . We 've got that personal history between us . " Deploring what he calls " one-shot juxtapositions  --  East-meets-West things , " which are often too " polite , static , and apologetic "  --  Laswell says that it 's in the " evolution " of repeated sessions that he finds the rough-and-tumble internationalism he seeks . Beyond that , he stands there , flinty eyed , as you invoke issues that arise when local , more " primitive " societies collide with the juggernaut of Western ideas and mores  --  what critics like anthropologist Clifford Geertz refer to as " the problem of culture . " Not discounting the potential dangers , Laswell , a wary , perhaps even thorny individual , asserts that true artistic dialogue , " when everyone is serious , " militates against cultural domination . Politics and social issues will always be part of what he does , Laswell says , because the sort of global street music he and his far-flung partners create is all about " people talking about their lives ... today . " For his part , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea is to come without those kind of expectations . This is about the music In contemplating that music , one can not be deaf to the occasional complaint lodged against Laswell 's brand of restless cosmopolitanism . One fan , while professing ultimate respect for Laswell 's remarkable proliferation of material ( " material " being the rubric under which as well manages his rather diversified musical empire ) , says there 's a certain sameness to many of the artist 's more recent projects . " He lays that dance/trance bass track over everything so it 's like the world according to Bill ; the Laswell-centric worlds of Bill . " Indeed , Laswell 's omnipresent , hard-blues-based " funk " predilections  --  he 's worked extensively with George Clinton , Bootsy Collins , and other members of P-funk , the phantasmagorical 1970s soul band , in addition to several rappers  --  are more effective in certain settings than others . Some collaborations , such as Sola , an attempted marriage of Peking opera stylistics with the angular notions of jazzmen like Henry Threadgill , prompt the listener to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , when Laswell 's gritty sensibility connects with his seemingly inexhaustible capacity to accommodate various influences , he becomes a formidable synthesizing force . One of his greatest achievements is the 1988 Hear no Evil , which makes spectacular use of the far-flung talents of Indian percussionist Zakir Hussain , Puerto Rican salsaserio Daniel Ponce , Korean drummer Aiyb Dieng , and Indian violin player Shankar . Under the aegis of Laswell 's Merlinlike mixing and matching , what unfolds is not unlike the soundtrack to a science-fiction cowboy epic set somewhere in Asia , a subcontinental country-and-western opus . Perhaps even more thrilling is Laswell 's current work with the youthful , politically active antifundamentalist Muslim group Aisha Kandisha 's Jarring Effects . On " Shabeesation " it is as if yearning Arabic drone and thrumming Detroit bass were never fully whole until Laswell put them together . Laswell never assumes that every one of his bounteous projects is going to be a success . " We 're experimenting . If you knew what would work before you did it , why do it " What concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner in which " world " music , a term he finds oppressively vague , is presented to the public . " The **27;180;TOOLONG thing has massive conceptual problems , " Laswell says , referring to the spate of recent CD compilations such as Planet Drum ( supplying one drum cut from Haiti , followed by one drum cut from Laos , and so on , for hours ) . " It 's fine that people around the world play drums or accordions , and we have that in common , but you put so much of that together , one little bit from here , another from there , it does n't mean anything anymore . The other day I saw this world sampler CD Planet Soup . There 's a lot of great music there , but the cover has these instruments floating into a soup pot , like the more the merrier . Geez . To me , the world 's just a little more complicated than that . " Mark Jacobson , journalist , novelist , and screenwriter , lives in Brooklyn , New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
