This story can be told in different ways . To some , it is the " death of the phoenix , " a major victory for the opponents of the New Federalism. 1 To others , it is a tale of judicial incursions into state legislative and executive authority , ultimately beaten back by an aroused public. 2 This article 's perspective is neither a defense nor a condemnation of state constitutionalism or the actors who influenced its development in California . Rather , California is seen as an ideological battleground between liberal forces and their conservative opponents , each seeking to use the state constitution for their own ends . For the liberals , who initially succeeded in controlling the state supreme court and , from that vantage point , the interpretation of the state bill of rights , the agenda was clear : Combat a rightward-moving United States Supreme Court by establishing a liberal state constitutional beachhead . For their opponents , who won great victories in 1982 ( curtailing state exclusionary rules ) and 1986 ( removing three liberal supreme court justices ) only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited the public referendum authority ) , the goal was no less apparent : unseat the liberals and recapture the state constitution for the conservative point of view . <p> Although one might fruitfully examine school financing , civil rights , or any number of other legal controversies that embroiled the American judiciary generally , and the California courts in particular , the focus of this five-part article is on criminal justice or , more precisely , on the portions of the federal and state constitutions that create rights for those accused of crime and on the United States and California Supreme Court decisions interpreting them . The first part provides background on the California Constitution and the California Supreme Court . Part two examines selected death penalty decisions of the California Supreme Court , compares U.S. Supreme Court rulings on the subject , and analyzes the impact of the California cases upon the state constitution and upon California judicial politics . Parts three and four provide the same type of analysis for search and seizure and for Miranda rulings , respectively . The fifth part relates how conservative forces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal decisions . This article closes with some observations on the lessons of California for the future of state constitutional law . THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION AND THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT <p> As is well known , the Bill of Rights of the United States Constitution contains four provisions  --  Amendments Four , Five , Six , and Eight  --  that concern the criminally accused . Less well known is that the California Constitution , and likewise the constitutions of the remaining forty-nine states , provide quite similar rights . As do most states , California places in the first article of its constitution rights akin to those found in the first eight amendments to the U.S. Constitution . With the exception of certain jury and counsel rights and a separate state right to privacy , Californian and federal criminal justice rights are textually equivalent . However , after about 1970 , the interpretation of the California Constitution by the state supreme court began to diverge significantly from the interpretation given the federal fundamental charter . This divergence , which some would say is the essence of the New Judicial Federalism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> From 1850 , when California became the thirty-first state until over a century later , the criminal justice rights in Article I of the state constitution received relatively little attention from the California high court. 3 This changed dramatically in the 1970s , with the rise of the Burger Court and the perceived threat to the Warren " criminal justice revolution . " 4 When the Burger Court signaled that it would no longer be looking to expand defendants ' rights , and would rather create exceptions that favored the prosecution , some of the state courts discovered that they could preserve these rights by interpreting state constitutional bills of rights provisions more broadly than comparable federal provisions . Moreover , such state court cases are generally not subject to Supreme Court review and , therefore , could not be reversed by the Burger justices. 5 The California Supreme Court was in the forefront of this development , and it is to the work of that court that we now turn . <p> For a fifteen-year period , from 1971 to 1986 , the California Supreme Court was among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the national leaders in relying upon a state constitution to decide cases . Many of these state constitutional decisions rejected the reasoning or results of U.S. Supreme Court cases dealing with the same subject . Prior to the 1970s , the California Supreme Court had established a national reputation under Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson ( 1940 to 1964 ) and under the intellectual leadership of Associate Justice Roger J. Traynor ( 1940 to 1970 ) . 6 But most of the court 's reputation was built upon its work in traditional areas of state law , such as tort law , not in constitutional law  --  federal or state. 7 In criminal law , for example , although Traynor authored an opinion endorsing the exclusionary rule for illegal searches and seizures six years before the U.S. Supreme Court mandated it nationally in Mapp v. Ohio , the decision was grounded upon judicially created rules of evidence subject to legislative revision , not constitutional law , which is virtually immune from legislative review. 8 Thus , the court was " activist , " but not in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will now analyze some of the California Supreme Court state constitutional law cases decided during the period from 1972 to 1991 , placing them into three categories : the death penalty , search and seizure , and Mirando . For each category , I will compare the U.S. Supreme Court decisions on the subject with those rendered by its California counterpart . This should indicate the differences between the interpretation of the state and federal bill of rights , the source of so much of the political/ideological conflict in California . THE DEATH PENALTY IN CALIFORNIA <p> People v. Anderson was like a fire bell in the night . Insofar as criminal justice policy is concerned , perhaps no issue separates liberals and conservatives more than capital punishment. 9 Under the Eighth Amendment ( " nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted " ) as construed by the Supreme Court , executions are permitted but only if capital punishment is proportionate to the crime , and , to date , no crime other than aggravated homicide has been held to warrant so drastic a punishment. 10 Thus , even " ordinary " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with certain specified aggravating circumstances ( such as murder for hire , during the commission of another felony , or murder of an on-duty police or corrections officer ) may receive the ultimate penalty. 11 <p> The Supreme Court did not reach its position until 1976 in Gregg v. Georgia , and then only over the passionate protest of liberal Warren Court holdovers , William J. Brennan , Jr. , and Thurgood Marshall . Four years earlier , in Furman v. Georgia , Brennan and Marshall had been in the majority , but they alone contended that the death penalty was inherently unconstitutional. 12 <p> In 1972 , shortly before the Furman ruling , the California Supreme Court in People v. Anderson resolved the death penalty question on state constitutional grounds , expressly eschewing the federal Eighth Amendment issue . In 1965 , Robert Page Anderson shot and killed a San Diego pawnshop clerk and was captured at the scene after a shoot-out with police . A jury found Anderson guilty of murder and sentenced him to death , a sentence initially upheld on appeal to the state supreme court. 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitions and two years later , in 1968 , the sentence was set aside. 15 It was reimposed by a second jury following another sentencing trial , and once again Anderson appealed to the California Supreme Court . This set the stage for the court 's controversial 1972 state constitutional ruling . <p> The vote was 6 to 1 in favor of reversal . Chief Justice Donald R. Wright , appointed by Governor Ronald Reagan in 1970 , wrote the opinion of the court . Justice Marshall F. McComb , who wrote the opinion upholding the death penalty in the first supreme court ruling in Anderson , was the lone dissenter . The majority opinion made quite clear that it was relying upon the state cruel or unusual punishments clause , not the federal , for its decision . This is significant not only because of its implications for the construction of the state constitution but also for the procedural posture of the case . If a state court rests its decision on state and not federal grounds , the U.S. Supreme Court generally can not review the case. 16 Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prosecution because no higher court could take jurisdiction . <p> With respect to the state constitution , Chief Justice Wright emphasized that , unlike the federal Eighth Amendment , which bars cruel and unusual punishments , Article 1 , Section 6 ( later renumbered Section 17 ) , prohibits cruel or unusual punishments . The difference , he contended , was significant because the use of the disjunctive signifies that either characteristic alone  --  cruelty or unusualness  --  would render a punishment unconstitutional , whereas the federal provision , written in the conjunctive , requires proof that the penalty is both cruel and unusual . As the opinion progressed , it soon became clear that this argument was unnecessary : The court found that the death penalty was both cruel and unusual . The court also dismissed as " mere speculation and conjecture " the contention that other state constitutional provisions , such as the one granting the supreme court " appellate jurisdiction when judgment of death has been pronounced , " implied that capital punishment was not cruel or unusual . <p> As for the penalty 's cruelty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies not only in the execution itself and the pain incident thereto , but also in the dehumanizing effects of the lengthy imprisonment prior to execution . " 17 Regarding unusualness , the court noted that the penalty was rarely imposed in California and even more rarely carried out . Statistics were marshaled to demonstrate that this was part of a worldwide trend toward abolition . <p> Thus , even before the Supreme Court 's Furman decision and well before the ultimate repudiation in Gregg of the Anderson position , that the death penalty is per se cruel and unusual , the California Supreme Court struck boldly , creating virtually unreviewable state constitutional law  --  unreviewable perhaps , but not irreversible . Death penalty proponents quickly mobilized public support for a new constitutional amendment , adopted through the public referendum process , and before year 's end , Article 1 , Section 27 , was added to the fundamental state charter . It reads as follows : <p> All statutes of this state in effect on February 17 , 1972 , requiring , authorizing , imposing , or relating to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to legislative amendment or repeal by statute , initiative , or referendum . <p> The death penalty provided for under those statutes shall not be deemed to be , or to constitute , the infliction of cruel or unusual punishments within the meaning of Article 1 , Section 6 nor shall such punishment for such offenses be deemed to contravene any other provision of this constitution . <p> February 17 was the day before the Anderson decision , and the intent of Section 27 seems quite evident , namely , to flat-out overturn the supreme court 's Anderson ruling and declare the death penalty statute constitutionally valid . But the court was not without weapons of its own . It could subject Article 1 , Section 27 , to interpretation , as it could any other constitutional provision implicated in its cases , and it could interpret narrowly or broadly . At first , in a 1979 case , the conservatives ' victory seemed complete . People v. Frierson held that Section 27 validated the death penalty statute as a state constitutional matter and that the statute did not violate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court asserted that it still had authority to prohibit the imposition of the death penalty , this time because the statutory definition of the aggravating circumstance was unduly vague. 19 And in 1988 , the justices went even further , declaring that they could still prohibit the death penalty on cruel or unusual punishment grounds in any case in which they deemed the punishment disproportionate to the crime , so long as they did not rule that the penalty was inherently cruel or unusual. 20 <p> Looking back on Anderson and its impact , a California law professor concluded that the decision plunged the state into a " profoundly polarizing controversy , " one that " gravely damaged the public credibility of the court . " 21 Since 1988 , however , with Deukmejian and Wilson appointments in full control , there has been a palpable change in the court 's attitude toward the death penalty. 22 The short of the matter is that the state 's cruel or unusual punishment provision has been brought into line with the federal Eighth Amendment , as construed by the Burger/Rehnquist Court . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered four people in their home : two boys , aged eight and ten , their mother , and their grandmother. 23 The California Supreme Court upheld his conviction and death sentence by a 6 to I vote , holding that the defendant 's youth at the time of the crime did not make the penalty disproportionate to the offense . More revealing was the court 's statement about the meaning of the state constitution : " As a general interpretive principle , " said the justices , " imposition of the death penalty under California law does not violate the state proscription against cruel or unusual punishment ( California Constitution Article 1 , Section 17 ) to the extent it comports with the federal Constitution . " 24 Thus , some twenty years after Anderson , the battle over the state constitutional punishments clause ended in a clear victory for the conservatives ; it now provides no greater obstacle to execution than its federal parallel . SEARCH AND SEIZURE AND THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION <p> Search and seizure law has been one of the great sources of contention in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict is that the most effective method of enforcing constitutional restrictions upon law enforcement activities requires that illegally obtained evidence of a defendant 's guilt be excluded from the adjudication process , with the result that prosecution is rendered more difficult . The primary purpose of excluding or suppressing evidence  --  usually tangible , and therefore reliable evidence of guilt  --  is to deter law enforcers from again violating constitutional restrictions . But in a period of high crime rates , there is , understandably , much opposition to legal rules that work to the advantage of accused criminals . The Burger/Rehnquist Court sought to adjust in favor of the state many of the Fourth Amendment requirements that could be expected to lead to the frequent exclusion of evidence . Two of these " adjustments " will be discussed here . These cases were chosen because the California Supreme Court , construing the near-identical language of the California Constitution , rejected the Burger/ Rehnquist approach , instead adopting rules that establish broader rights . After analyzing the cases , I will discuss the 1982 state constitutional amendment that was intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue involves what is known as the " search incident to arrest . " Although the Fourth Amendment appears to favor advance judicial approval ( warrants ) for searches by police , there are certain recurring situations in which a warrant would be wholly impractical . Such a situation includes the period immediately after an arrest . The Warren Court upheld warrantless searches of arrested persons on the ground that arresting officers need to prevent the suspect from grabbing a weapon or evidence that could be destroyed. 25 In United States v. Robinson , the Burger Court held that even for a minor crime , such as driving with a revoked license , although there is no reason to expect to find a weapon or evidence , an arrest justifies a full search of the suspect and the area under the suspect 's control. 26 The majority pointed out the dangers in accompanying any suspect to the police station and the advantages in having a uniform rule covering all arrests . But for those inclined to mistrust the police , Robinson seemed like an invitation to search individuals on the pretext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim of finding evidence of a more serious crime  --  a perversion of the search-incident rationale. 27 <p> In 1975 , in People v. Norman , the California Supreme Court rejected Robinson. 28 Norman also began with a traffic infraction . The defendant was driving at 4:00 A.M. without headlights , for which he was stopped by the police . He cursed the officers and drove off , running a red light and a stop sign . Ultimately , Norman got out of the car with a black object in his hand . Ordered by the police to drop it , he threw it under the van . The police found the object , a plastic tobacco pouch , and opened it ; it contained marijuana , cigarette papers , and seconal . <p> Under the Robinson rule , the search of the pouch would probably have been upheld as an incident to arrest for the offense of evading arrest . But the California Supreme Court , speaking through Chief Justice Wright , suppressed the drugs . The court required that before searching the pouch , the police must have probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contraband , or weapons . As there was no independent basis for concluding that any of these things were in the pouch , the search was held to have violated Article 1 , Section 13 , of the state constitution . Thus , pursuant to Norman , police may not search incident to an arrest unless there is reason to believe that weapons or evidence are likely to be found ; whereas under the federal Constitution , the fact that someone is arrested in and of itself justifies a search of the arrestee and his " grab area . " 29 <p> The second issue in which California refused to tilt search and seizure law toward police concerns the searches of automobiles . As is the case with searches incident to arrest , the Supreme Court has long permitted warrantless searches of motor vehicles on the ground that their mobility ( or , as some of the modern cases emphasize , the absence of legitimate privacy expectations for cars ) obviates the need for prior judicial authorization to search. 30 Not until 1982 , however , did the Court finally resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , how much of the vehicle and the objects recovered from the vehicle could be searched under the so-called " automobile exception " to the search warrant requirement . In United States v. Ross , the Burger Court held that such searches could extend to any part of the vehicle in which it was reasonable to expect to find the sought-after items and could also include the opening of any " closed containers " ( court lingo for briefcases , pocketbooks , and the like ) found in the vehicle. 31 <p> The California Supreme Court rejected two planks of the Ross rule . First , it said that probable cause to search a car does not necessarily justify a search of its concealed areas , such as its trunk. 32 The Wimberly case illustrates : Wimberly was driving erratically at 2:30 A M. when police stopped him . The officers saw a jacket , marijuana seeds , and a pipe on the floor of the vehicle and smelled the odor of burned marijuana . A search of the jacket uncovered a plastic bag of marijuana . The police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they opened with the defendant 's keys . There they found a sizeable cache of marijuana . The state high court suppressed the marijuana recovered from the trunk while admitting the evidence found in the passenger compartment . It held that the state constitution protects privacy in the trunk . Unless the police have probable cause to believe that there is evidence in a concealed area of a vehicle ( the same rule would apply to the glove compartment ) , they can not search in the area without a warrant . By contrast , Ross permits a search of any portion of a vehicle in which the evidence could be found , without any additional justification for concealed areas . <p> The California Supreme Court rejected a second tenet of the Ross rule : that so-called closed containers may be opened and searched without additional probable cause over and above that needed to search the automobile . People v. Ruggles is the key case. 33 Police , suspecting that Ruggles was responsible for a series of motel-clerk robberies , set up surveillance at a time when he was expected to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown briefcase from the trunk of a car , entered his apartment building , and returned some ten minutes later with the briefcase . Ruggles then placed the briefcase back in the trunk and drove off . Police followed and stopped him . On the backseat of the car , they saw narcotics paraphernalia ; from the trunk they recovered two tote bags , halloween masks , and the brown briefcase . Police opened the briefcase and found , among other items , two guns , ammunition , handcuffs ( the motel clerks had been handcuffed by the robbers ) , and a bandanna . <p> The California Supreme Court suppressed the items found in the briefcase . The court reasoned that the police had probable cause to search the vehicle , including the trunk , for weapons and other holdup evidence , but this did not justify a search of closed containers in the vehicle . Under the state constitution , such containers could not be searched without a warrant. 34 <p> Thus , in two major areas of search and seizure law  --  searches incident to arrest and automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article 1 , Section 13 , of the state constitution , provided broader rights than defendants have under the Fourth Amendment as interpreted by the Burger/Rehnquist Court . Liberals may have cheered the use of the state constitution to preserve rights against Supreme Court depredations , but conservatives viewed such rulings as favoring criminals and handcuffing law enforcement . Ultimately , the conservatives succeeded in rolling back these decisions . However , before I tell how , I will discuss the development of the Miranda rule under the California Constitution . THE MIRANDA RULE IN CALIFORNIA <p> The Warren Court 's 1966 decision in Miranda v. Arizona has also been a lightning rod for conservative critics of the judiciary. 35 As early as 1971 , in Harris v. New York , the Burger Court established an exception to the rule. 36 Normally , if police fail to meet Miranda requirements  --  for instance , they do not read all of the famed warnings about the right to counsel and silence  --  the suspect 's statements , even a full confession , are inadmissible at trial as evidence of the suspect 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to impeach the defendant 's testimony should he testify at his trial , in order to prevent the Miranda rule from becoming a " shield for perjury . " Consequently , under Harris , statements taken in violation of the Miranda rule can come into the courtroom through the back door during cross-examination of the accused. 37 <p> In People v. Disbrow , the California Supreme Court rejected the Harris rule for the state self-incrimination clause , Article 1 , Section 15. 38 Four arguments were offered against Harris . First , it hearkens back to the pre-Miranda approach to confessions , which had been rejected ( in Miranda ) because of the difficulties in applying it. 39 Second , a mere caution to juries from the trial judge , to refrain from considering impeachment evidence as proof of guilt , is not likely to be effective . Third , Harris reduces police incentives to comply with Miranda by weakening the Miranda exclusionary rule . And finally , the integrity of the judiciary is undermined by having to admit into a trial illegally obtained statements . <p> Once again , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the California high court challenged the highest court in the land , and , utilizing the state constitution , established more protections for the criminally accused . And once again , as they did with the death penalty , conservatives mobilized opposition , amended the state constitution , and rolled back both the search and seizure and Miranda rulings . THE CONSERVATIVE ASCENDANCY <p> The California Constitution empowers voters to amend the fundamental law of the state by initiative , that is , by popular vote. 40 On 8 June 1982 , the public approved Proposition 8 , which amended the state constitution by adding a twenty-eighth section to the first article . The focus was entirely on criminal justice , covering such matters as the rights of victims , school safety , bail , and what was called " truth-in-evidence . " The truth-in evidence portion , Article 1 , Section 28(d) , is most relevant here . It reads as follows : <p> Except as provided by statute hereafter enacted by a two-thirds vote of the membership in each house of the I Legislature relevant evidence shall not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction motions and hearings , or in any trial or hearing of a juvenile for a criminal offense , whether heard in juvenile or adult court . <p> The operative words are " relevant evidence , " for relevance here means relevance to the question of guilt or innocence . Thus , evidence excludable pursuant to the state constitution because of search and seizure or Miranda violations would be admissible if relevant to guilt . ( Evidence excludable under the federal Constitution would still be inadmissible because the state constitution can not abridge federal constitutional rights . ) In one bold stroke , as the state supreme court itself recognized , state exclusionary rules broader than the federal ones were all eliminated. 41 Consequently , all of the search and seizure and Miranda cases discussed above  --  Norman , Wimberly , Ruggles , and Disbrow  --  are probably nullified. 42 Dosbrow , which had rejected the Harris rule , presents a clear-cut example . In 1988 , in People v. May , which raised the identical legal issue , the state high court declared Disbrow " abrogated " and noted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with exclusionary rules derived solely from the state Constitution . " 43 <p> Four years after Proposition 8 , conservative forces mounted a successful drive to remove Chief Justice Rose Bird and Associate Justices Joseph R. Grodin and Cruz Reynoso when they were up for retention. 44 It was the first time in California history that any supreme court justice  --  much less three of them  --  was rejected by the electorate. 45 The most salient issue was the court 's approach to the death penalty and criminal justice in general. 46 The change in court personnel along with the change in the state constitution tamed the state high court . The number of cases in which the court rejected Supreme Court doctrine diminished considerably , and the number of " adoption " rulings rose. 47 <p> Undoubtedly emboldened by their success , conservatives mounted a new campaign for yet another amendment to the state constitution . On 5 June 1990 , the electorate approved Proposition 115 , which sought to amend Article 1 , Section 24 , of the state constitution . The amendment declared that thirteen different state constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I of the California Constitution  --  " shall be construed by the courts of this state in a manner consistent with the Constitution of the United States . " And , presumably to cover any right not enumerated , the new proposition added : " This Constitution shall not be construed by the courts to afford greater rights to criminal defendants than those afforded by the Constitution of the United States . " <p> This time , the state supreme court  --  with five Republican Deukmejian appointments sitting  --  fought back . In Raven v. Deukmejian , the court invalidated the part of Proposition 115 that amended Article 1 , Section 24 , on the grounds that it was " so far reaching as to amount to a constitutional revision beyond the scope of the initiative porcess. " 48 " In essence and practical effect , " said the court , " new article 1 , section 24 , would vest all judicial interpretive power , as to fundamental criminal defense rights , in the United States Supreme Court . From a qualitative standpoint , the effect of Proposition 115 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sweeping a change in the state constitution would have to be accomplished by the more deliberative process of a constitutional convention or legislative approval , followed in either case by popular ratification . <p> What accounts for such a **25;230;TOOLONG ruling by a conservative court ? The answer is that the court apparently saw this more as an anti-court than an anti-criminal measure , and there is nothing like institutional solidarity for transcending ideological divisions . Under Section 24 , the judiciary would be virtually barred from interpreting the state constitution differently from the federal one in criminal cases . State judges , especially on the appellate courts , would lose a potent source of their authority . The state legislature and even trial courts could act without fear of reversal on state constitutional grounds . This was going too far  --  even for conservative supreme court justices . CONCLUSION : CALIFORNIA AND THE NEW FEDERALISM <p> There are some clear lessons to be learned from California 's extraordinary but fascinating experience . First and foremost , state constitutions may be used not only to broaden rights but also to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. Constitution . Therefore , forces within a state dissatisfied with liberal court interpretations of the fundamental state law may , without nearly the same effort required on the federal level , undo those rulings . The 1972 amendment reinstating the death penalty and the 1982 amendment wiping out state exclusionary rules are potent examples . <p> Second , the state judiciary must be careful not to unduly antagonize powerful state interests and , especially , the other branches of state government . Cases grounded on statutory construction or judicial rulemaking are subject to legislative modification and therefore to political compromise , but decisions based upon the state constitution are not so easily changed . If such decisions sufficiently provoke powerful state political forces , they will fight back . And the state judiciary is vulnerable , accountable to the public in various ways , including limited terms of office and popular elections . Rose Bird 's removal certainly proves the point . <p> Finally , lest opponents of the bench get complacent , it should not be forgotten that the judges have potent weapons of their own . Constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are themselves subject to judicial construction . The death penalty amendment did not eliminate judicial review of capital cases , and Proposition 115 was gutted by the high court 's narrow construction of the referendum authority . The California Supreme Court has made quite clear that it is not going to yield its authority to interpret the state constitution without a fight . California 's constitutional battleground is calmer nowadays , but the struggle may have only abated . <p>
