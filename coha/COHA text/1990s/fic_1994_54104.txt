He had never like the young dancing Astaire , all greedy and certain . But now he was watching an old ghost thriller , and he liked Astaire old , pasted against the wall of mortality  --  dry , scared , maybe faintly alcoholic . This was a man . He pitied him . Everything good had pity in it , it seemed to Smith , now fifty and a man of some modest fashion himself . Even as a drunkard he had been a bit of a dandy . It was midnight when he turned off the set . He had begun thinking sadly about his friend Drum again , the man whose clothes were a crying shame . Drum two summers ago had exchanged his .22 for a pistol of a large bore , one that was efficient . In his bathtub in a trailer home on the out-skirts of that large town in Alabama , he had put the barrel in his mouth . He had counted off the days on his calendar a full month ahead of the event of his suicide , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bye Drum . " The note he left was not original . It was a vile poem off the bathroom wall , vintage World War II . He had destroyed his unpublished manuscripts and given away all his other art and had otherwise put his affairs in order , with directions he was to be cremated and there was to be no ceremony . <p> But two young friends had organized a ceremony for themselves . Many had loved and needed Drum . They had pleaded over the phone for Smith , of all people , to gather with them , but the town was such a valley of the shadow to Smith , with an air choked by rotten cherries and whiskey , he did not go . He felt cowardly and selfish , because it was ceremonies of pity that most moved him now , but he could not take his part . He asked his sons to appear at the ceremony for him . They wore suits and went to the funeral home and stood with a mournful group of people in wretched cheap dark clothes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rite for another person . <p> Smith did not like arithmetic or its portents , but he recalled Drum at his death was sixty-six , twice the age of Christ at Golgotha . With Drum this was relevant , and overbore the vile poem . Drum had been a successful carpenter several years previous . <p> But in Smith 's class ten years before the end , Drum was fifty-six and looked much like Charles Bronson . Big flat nose and thin eyes with a blue nickel gleam in them ; three marriages behind him , and two sons by an opera singer far away in Germany . He held a degree in aeronautical engineering from UCLA . He could fix anything , and with stern joyful passion . He had written six unpublished novels . He served in the army in Panama in the years just after the World War , which he would have been a bit young for . Smith stole glances at Drum while he taught , or tried to , with his marriage and grip on things going to pieces . He tried to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was a fool or a genius . There were indications both ways . <p> As in Smith 's progress toward the condition of a common drunkard . <p> Smith wanted to be both lost and found , an impossibility . He was nearly begging to be insane . He saw this fellow of great persuasive ugliness , with his small airy voice and his sighs ; the weariness about him , even with his blocky good build and the forearms of a carpenter . He was popular in class even these short weeks into the semester . Drummond was his last name . He pleased the girls around him . He was avuncular and selfless in his comments , with a beam of patient affection in his eyes . Somehow he scared Smith , Drum holding his smile , the flattened great bags under his eyes from rough living and failure . He spoke often of " love " and " quest . " He prefaced many things he said with " I am a Christian , " sadly , as if he were in some dreadful losers ' club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him and had a brief collapse . <p> " I 'm sorry . " He put his hands down flat . There seemed to be a whole bleak country in front of his eyes , the ten hills of his fingers on the desert floor of linoleum , speckled by gray lakes , all dry . " I 'm sorry to be confusing . Things are n't going well at home . Bear with me . " <p> Drum befriended him . He seemed to be just all at once there , his hand on Smith 's shoulder and the grave twinkle in his eyes . The little smile of a prophet on his lips . Two of the very attractive girls from the class , right behind him , were looking concerned . Maybe they liked Smith . He did n't know . He could n't get a read on much at all these days . Arrogance punctuated by bouts of heartbreaking sentiment had come on Smith since the publication of his last book , which was hailed by major critics and bought by a few hundred people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was experiencing a gathering distaste for almost everybody . He would nowadays mumble and shout a few things in anguish that seemed loud and eternal , then call class . To others that might seem derelict , but many of his students grandly appreciated the quick hits and release , right in the manner of a Punk lecture . Punk was all the rage that year , and in his class was a lame girl wearing a long sash with sleighbells on it , so that when she wallowed along in the hall on big stomping crutches , a holy riot ensued . She wore enormous eyeglasses but was otherwise dressed and cut Punk , wearing a hedge of waxed hair atop her tubular head . She was the Punkest of them all , a movement unto herself . Smith noticed that Drum was very kind to her and cheered her various get-ups every class meeting . The girl was unceasingly profane , too . This seemed to interest Drum even more . He grinned and applauded her , this funny Christian Drum . <p> Nevertheless , she had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved his hungover explosions , but complained that he cut them too short and she was not getting her money 's worth . Smith was incredulous . It was his first experience with a vocal minority , the angry disabled woman . Angel B. was very serious about her writing  --  very bad  --  and viewed it as her only salvation . He was not imparting the secrets of the art to her . She must know everything , no holding back . All this with a Punk 's greediness and nearly solid blue language , the bells shaking . Smith noted that he made no complaint about the bells . Smith planned to kill her and insist on one of her prettier banalities for her headstone , so that she could be mocked for centuries . But this man Drum loved her even as the talentless bitch she was . How could he be here offering to help Smith ? <p> " What can we do , Paul ? " Drum was whispering and uncleish . The two girls nodded their wishes to help too . Smith looked them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , pretty with lean shanks , who looked like she was right then-slipping into a bathtub with Nietzsche , that lovely caution about her . The other was pre-Raphaelite , a mass of curly hair around a pale face very oval , the hair coiled up on her cheeks and separating for the full lips . <p> " We could drink , " said Smith , dying for a taste . He was imagining a long telescope of whiskey and soda through which to view these newcomers to his pain . He liked people waving like liquid images , hands reaching toward him . <p> At home the end was near . His wife , just out of the tub , would cover her breasts with her arms as she went to her drawers in their bedroom . Smith watched , alarmed and in grief . No old times anymore . She meant , These are for something else , somewhere else down the road . He had hoped to hang on to ambivalence just a little bit longer . He wanted her more than ever . He said unforgettable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have its own rude life . Here he was , no closer to her than a ghoul gazing through a knothole to her toilet , the hole rimmed with slobber , in their own big smart house . <p> They all went to the Romeo Bar on the university strip . Smith saw Drum drive up with the girls in a bleached mustard Toyota with a bee drawn on it at the factory . Smith thought it was an art statement , but it was not . Drum was poor . <p> He wore unironed clothes , things deeply cheap , dead and lumpy even off the rack at bargain barns , and the color of harmful chemicals , underneath them sneakers with velcro snaps instead of shoestrings . The clothes of folks from a broken mobile home , as a pal of Smith 's had described them . Drum at fifty-six lived upstairs in a small frame house of asbestos siding . In the lower story lived his mother , whom he called the Cobra . The brand of his smokes was Filter Cigarettes . His beer was white cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls were rapt as Smith poured forth . He was a bothered half-man , worn out by the loss of heart and music of the soul . <p> Drum agreed about the times , entirely . " There should be only a radio in every home , issuing bulletins on the War . The War of good against evil . That 's all the news we need , " he said , directing the bar air like a maestro . " But all they give us is facts , numbers , times . Enough of this and nobody cares about the War anymore . Why , all television addresses is the busybody in everybody ! <p> " We 're born to kill each other . First thing in the morning we take something to numb us , then parachute into the sordid zones of reality . Layers of dead skin on us , layers ! " he finished . <p> Everything surprised the girls . They seemed to adore being confidantes in Drum 's presence . They were anxious to become writers and have sorrows of their own . The grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That through a knothole looking at her toilet thing was beautiful , said the pre-Raphaelite Minny . <p> Later , they all stayed over at Smith 's green hovel by the railroad tracks he 'd rented as his writing place , a heartbreaking first move toward divorce . Minny took ether and began talking about her enormous clitoris , a thing that kept her in nerves and panic every waking hour . Pepper passed out before she could recall any true sorrow . Drum went back in the kitchen with some of Smith 's stories . He had on half-glasses bought at a drugstore , and Smith saw him foggily as a god : Charles Bronson as a kitchen god . Smith retired with Minny . <p> Then in the morning his wife knocked on the door . Smith answered in a leather overcoat , nude underneath . He was stunned by drink and ether , and his wife 's presence simply put a sharpness on his wrecked eyesight . Behind him in a bedsheet sat Minny in front of a drum set . She was sitting there smiling at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told them later . <p> His wife said something about divorce papers , and Smith slapped her . She rammed the door shut . <p> " Oh , how old World ! " Minny cried . She dropped the sheet and rose naked and curly like something from a fountain . Already Smith was tired of her . He loved Pepper , the lean beauty who could not get her sorrow out , asleep in the rear room . <p> " That 's no good , Paul . You should n't hit . " Drum had awoken and come out . His big fingers were around a fresh cold beer . " oh , I hit my second wife . She thrived on it . Some women like hitting , they work for it . But it 's a bad thing . A man of your sensitivity , with that sad little child in you , you wo n't survive , is what I 'm saying . " <p> " I love the sad child ! " said Minny . <p> " But it makes an end to things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Purgatory is much rougher than hell . Well I know . You 've got to wish them well , and be off . Wish them well in love , hope they have good orgasms . " <p> " My God ! " Smith could not imagine this charity . <p> Sometime later in the week Smith asked Drum how he 'd lost three wives . <p> " Because I was a failure , man ! " Drum seemed delighted . " I wrote and wrote and could n't get published . I quit all my jobs . I 'd had it with facts , the aeronautics industry . Working plans to fly in a coal mine , baby ! The heart , Paul , the heart , that 's where it is . " <p> On the last of his GI Bill the man was taking ceramics , photography , sculpture , and Smith 's writing class . <p> " I pride myself on being a dilettante ! I am looking for accidental successes . Heart accidents . I want to slip down and fall into something wonderful ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad thing running in his family . His father and two older brothers had gone out early with coronaries , and he himself took nitroglycerin tablets to ward off angina . <p> Even Smith 's Punk band excited Drum . Anything declamatory of the heart moved him . He was very often their only audience . He applauded and commended , through their vileness . They switched instruments , versatile in absence of talent . It did n't matter . <p> " Everything must be explored ! Nothing left untouched ! " Drum shouted , slugging down his cheap beer , smoking his generics . <p> They played their own " Yeast Infection Blues " and a filthy cover of George Jones 's " He Stopped Loving Her Today . " The regular guitarist was a vicious harelip pursued all over town for bad checks . The singer was a round man with dense eyeglasses and a squint who sold term papers to fraternity boys . They called him the Reverend . The baseman was a boy who never wore shoes , hardly bathed , and in appearance approached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smutty . Drum absorbed them all . They were his children , junior alcoholics to Smith . Sometimes he 'd dance with Minny or Pepper . They shook the little green house and the police came . Perfect . <p> Smith poured Southern Comfort in a Pepsi can in order to make it through his lectures , which seemed a crucifixion . The crippled girl Angel B. seemed satisfied , liberated more thoroughly and writing even worse . As for his own heart , Smith wanted to get rid of it . He missed his wife terribly . The thing pounded as if it were an enormous fish in him . He was barred from his old home . The band was angry over his lack of endurance on the drums . one night Drum brought him over some chicken soup , vitamin B and glucomate . He was worried . <p> " Look at you . Look at this room , " he said . <p> Smith 's SS overcoat was spattered with white paint . He had painted everything instead of cleaning . He had painted even Minny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had nailed bedsheets to the floor . The novel he was writing was strewn out in copies all over the musical instruments . He and the band were singing his novel . The children from his first marriage were not allowed to visit him anymore . He had been fired at the college . Bare inside his overcoat , with a Maltese cross made by Drum hanging from a chain around his neck , he had grown so thin that his wedding band had fallen off somewhere . He was now almost pure spirit , as Minny called him . <p> " We need your big heart , Paul . The forces of good need you . Technique and facts and indifference are out there winning . Money is winning , mere form and the tightasses are winning . Commerce is making the town uglier and uglier . We Christians need you . You 're giving over to low anger and spite , drinking away your talent . An old bad thing coiled in the dust , that 's not you . " <p> Smith poured the remainder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Comfort . The overcoming taste would remind Smith forever of his last days in this town . <p> Drum had made the mug . on it was an ugly face with a cigarette in its lip . It was one of the forms of " Serge , " an old army drunk Drum had known in Panama . The man had been only in his thirties , like Smith , but already grotesque . He would line up for review every morning , everything wrong with his uniform , but with a tiny smile and ruined goggle-eyes , maimed in every inch by the night before . He 'd been busted from Sergeant four times . <p> Later Smith fought with the band and threw them out . Minny ran out of Valium . Now living was almost impossible without constant fornication . People with police records began showing up in the house . Some played musical instruments or sang , then stole the equipment . one night while he was plying Minny , who poured out high spiritual sighs , he had to have a drink . on his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . The man sprinted out the back window as Smith pulled his father 's antique shotgun off the wall . Then out came Minny , screaming for him please to not shoot anybody . <p> In the morning he accused her and her dog , who had remained silent , of setting him up . He put the cur in her arms and kicked them both out . Then he fell out in a sleep of a few hours . When he woke up it was midafternoon , and he knew something was gone . The antique shotgun was not on the wall . He stumbled to his kitchen and pulled a hunting knife out of his drawer . He intended to cut Minny 's pre-Raphaelite hair off and drag her down the railroad tracks by her ankles . In a swimsuit and his serious coat he went out to the tracks . He seemed to remember her other place was near the tracks somewhere down there . So he walked and walked and then he was in a black section of town , there in his overcoat with lion-tamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the hottest summer on record . In the overcoat he was drenched , just an arm with the pounding awful fish of his heart inside him . A black teenager , tall , came out of one of the houses and asked him what he was doing with that knife out here , his mama did n't like it . <p> " Hunting woman . " <p> " You sit down in that tree shade . " Smith gave him the knife . " How much you take for that coat ? I can get that paint off it . " <p> " I 'll sell you the coat if you 'll call a number for me . I do n't feel good . I 'm not all right . Here 's some money . Please get me some liquor too . " He gave his wallet to the boy . <p> " You wait . " <p> When Drum at last came out across the tracks and knelt beside him , Smith had terrible shakes , and could not pass out like he wanted to . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is nothing . I was drunker . And I was drunker alone . " Drum laughed . <p> Smith sold the black boy his coat for fifty dollars and got back his wallet . Then Smith stared into his wallet . <p> " Drum ? I got exactly the same in my wallet . That boy bought my coat with my own money . " <p> " Forget it . It was a horrible coat . A chump 's coat . A pretender 's coat . It was the coat of a man with a small dry heart . " <p> " It was ? " <p> Smith was out of money now , but he was waiting for a Reader 's Digest Sweepstakes check very seriously . His unopened mail was a foot high , but none of it was the right envelope . Then a letter came offering him some work in Hollywood . He took it around town , running up tabs with credit on it . Some people still liked Smith . one night late he came in from drinking and misplacing his car . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there it was . on the kitchen table . The kitchen had been cleaned . But on the table was the final version of " Serge , " the life-size ceramic head of the grinning old drunk , the butt of a real Pall Mall hanging from his lips . Drum , a year in labor on it , had given it to Paul Smith . There was a short note underneath it : " All yours . Go with Sarge . " Smith did not know it then , but this was as far as Drum would ever go in the arts . At first it made Smith afraid . He thought it was an insult . But then he knew it was n't . He laid his head down and wept . He had lost everything . He did not deserve this friend . <p> About three in the morning , into the last of his cheap wine , he heard a car in his drive and some bells at his door . It was Angel B. , the Punk crippled girl . She settled inside with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicker armchair . <p> " I know I ca n't write , but you are a great man . I can get your job back for you . I know some things on the person fired you , some of them taped . This would destroy her . " <p> It seemed a plausible and satisfactory thing to Smith . <p> " I might not can write but I want a piece of a great man to remember . Would you dim the lights ? " <p> He recalled the revulsion , but with an enormous pity overcoming it . In his final despair , the last anguished thrust and hold , he tried to mean actual love . He wanted to be a heavy soft trophy to her . The bells jangled faintly every now and then before he accomplished the end of his dream . Smith stroked Angel 's mohawk , grown high and soft . Then she was businesslike getting her clothes and crutches back together . She was leaving immediately . Smith suggested they at least have a wine together . <p> " No . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there waiting . We 've got a tough morning tomorrow . We 're going down to the station and I 'm putting rape charges on him . " <p> " He 's driving you ? What , pleading guilty ? " <p> " No , innocent . We 're still close . But I know what I know . " <p> She waddled out to the old Mustang . Morris waited in it like a pet . His dense glasses were full of moonlight . <p> A week later Drum drove him to the airport . <p> " I think that was it , Drummer . Pit bottom . And I can still taste her . " Smith was trying to get a long march out of sips of Southern Comfort . <p> " It probably was n't , sport . You get to go to California , stomping grounds of all my failures . Be patient , Paul . Nobody gets well quick , not with what you 've got . " <p> He remembered Drum taking his luggage . The man wore a shapeless blue-green jumpsuit with plastic sandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared . <p> Smith was not a success as a screenwriter . After he destroyed two typewriters , he spent a month in a hospital , where they talked about the same little child inside that Drum had often mentioned . Smith was befriended by a kind genius of a director , one of his heroes . The man gave him money that put him right with his child support , but Smith was unable to compose anything worthy for him , for all his effort . The bright healthy weather and opulence mocked him . He could not get past stupid good feelings . His work was entirely made-up and false . There was no saving it by pure language . He could not work sober and was greatly frightened by this fact . He was failing right along with the old Drummer . He had to take another teaching job in the Midwest . It was a prestigious place , but Smith felt dumb and small . <p> He kept up with Drum through the years left . The Drummer was making a lot of money as a carpenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have , if he were not a Christian , any number of miserable lonely housewives . The Cobra , his quarrelsome mother , died . He moved out to a big mobile home on the outskirts of town , near Cottondale . He attended the high school graduation of Smith 's son . He took and sent over a photograph of the boy in his gown receiving his diploma . He gave Smith 's children presents at Christmas . Many times he took them fishing . <p> Three years ago , Smith had bitten the bullet and visited Drum in his trailer . Drum had had a heart attack six months previous . He told Smith he could hold in pain , but this was too much . He drove himself to the hospital . Uninsured , he paid out a ghastly amount . The trailer was all he could afford now . A preacher had become his landlord . Smith offered to lend him some money . Drum refused . <p> " Oh no . We do n't want money to get into this , baby . Somehow things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This thing we have is too beautiful . " <p> The streets of the town were a long heart attack themselves to Smith . Everything felt like sorrow and confusion , and tasted like Southern Comfort with cherry juice poured in  --  a revulsion of the tongue that had never left him . He felt the town itself was mean and fatal , each street a channel of stunned horror . He feared for Drum 's health . How could he carry on here ? <p> He met Drum 's woman , a handsome lady of Greek descent . Drum was wild for her . She stayed over the night in their larger bedroom at the other end of the trailer . When she left , Smith told Drum he was very happy for him . <p> " I worried you 'd turned queer , " Smith kidded him . <p> " You ought to hear her moan , boy . I 'm bringing happiness to that one . " <p> Now Smith saddened , and his teeth cut into his tight underlip . Drum all those years without a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering them on ; urging them on to the great accidents of art and love . Drum the Drummer . Keeping the panic out , keeping the big heart in . He had convinced Smith he was worth something . He had convinced others that Smith was rare . Many days in California Smith had nothing else to take him through the blank stupid days . <p> " I 'm living on borrowed time , man . Nothing is unimportant . Every minute is a jewel . Every stroke of pussy , every nail in the board . " <p> He had lived that way every minute Smith had known him . That seemed very clear now . He looked at his friend and a shock passed through him . Drum was old , with wisps of gray hair combed back . He was pale , his eyes wet . The strong arms gestured and the mouth moved , but Smith heard nothing . Then the voice , like a whisper almost , came back . What was he saying ? The vision had overcome everything . <p> It occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith told him of some publishing luck and gave him a book , the man just nodded . You could see the boredom , almost distaste , freeze his eyes . He was not jealous . It simply did n't matter . <p> Near the end he had broken off relations with the Greek woman . His oldest son had come back from Germany to live with him , but he could not live with anybody . He asked him to leave the trailer . <p> And then the poem when they found him : <p> Here I sit all broken-hearted . Paid a nickel to shit , And only farted . <p> A common piece of trash off a bathroom wall , a punkish anonymity . <p> How could he ? Why not even a try at high personal salute ? The way he had believed in work , the big heart , the War . <p> Smith was angry a long time that Drum had left nothing else . <p> The waiting on borrowed time , the misery of his heart yearning like a bomb , the bad starving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suicide . Who was good for endless lingering , a permanent bad seat and bad magazine at the doctor 's office ? And with heaven looming right over there , right next to you salvation and peace , what Christian could hold out any longer ? <p> Yes , but the poem . <p> So common , so punk , so lost in democracy , like an old condom . <p> The wretched clothes , beneath and beyond style , the style of everybody waiting intolerable lengths of time in an emergency room . Clothes the head of Sarge belonged on , the smile of ruin on his lips . Here , sir . All accounted for . <p> <p> By BARRY HANNAH <p>
