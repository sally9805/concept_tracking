Eibrahim rented the back room in the Cafe du Nord , where he had set up four tables and to which he brought , through a small window in the cramped kitchen , masala dosas , idlis , meat curry , vegetable curry , and parathas . Outside the cafe , on the sidewalk , was a blackboard that said , " Masala dosa is ready . " Eibrahim was a Tamil from Vietnam . He spoke , in order of fluency , Vietnamese , French , Tamil , Hindi , and English . As we left , he would always give us a paratha wrapped in aluminum foil- " from the heart , " he would explain , pressing the package to his heart before presenting it to us . A mixed lot ate at Eibrahim 's . Mostly they were Tamils from Pondicherry or Sri Lanka , with the occasional French tourist of ethnic food who would try to eat her dosa clumsily with her fingers , all the while reading Nazim Hikmet in translation . Then Eibrahim would bring her a fork . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a kind rather than an obeisant way . We once went to the restaurant with Francoise , and all four tables were full of Tamil men . Upon seeing Francoise , Eibrahim motioned to three men at a table , and they quietly took up their plates and marched to the cafe in the other room . The boundary between the restaurant and the cafe was invisible-there was no wall between the two ; nonetheless , the division was as palpable as if it were of concrete . In the cafe were Algerians , Moroccans , travelers from the station , and working-class Frenchmen . There was a fight , often involving knives , almost every night . But none of the tough guys came to the back , although we had to pass through the cafe to get to the restaurant , and if we wanted a beer Eibrahim had to get it from the woman who ran the cafe . So , eating our dosas , we could watch the fracas in the cafe in comfort and safety . Nobody fought in the restaurant . Ever . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads close together over their curry were discussing ways to finance the Tigers in their homeland . Photograph // Eibrahim 's was always a good place to take visiting relatives and friends ; it showed a side of Paris not represented in the better arrondissements . No statuary or multicolored fountains , no aged ornate structures , no harmonious marriage of stone and river . The tables and chairs were the cheapest available ; the room was filled with the noise of the video game and the jukebox from the cafe . Physically , the restaurant could have been in any large metropolis where exiles gathered . And it was cheap . For thirty francs , one could get a masala dosa with chutney and sambar and a beer . The sambar would be hot on alternate days ; the other times it would be quickly reheated . But , we reasoned , it was the one and only place in Paris we could get dosas . And our guests liked to see Eibrahim recognize us , talk to us ; it reassured them that we had found our bearings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were absent for long . Those were very good times that year in Paris . We had plenty of money , plenty of friends , and the weather was fine . In the mornings we drank coffee and in the evenings we drank wine . Yes , in the mornings we drank coffee and in the evenings , wine . The tourists came in busloads around Notre Dame and the world was on holiday . Everyone was under thirty . The sunlight fell down in sheets on the white walls of the buildings outside our window . Sometimes we could see people in the windows facing us . Two girls in the spring afternoon came and sat by the window and smoked cigarettes as the light fell on their white faces and legs . It became hot , but it was the heat of Paris in June , warming rather than enervating , the kind of heat in which you go out after seven , walk endlessly , and have your dinner at a , sidewalk table around eleven : chilled Beaujolais by the glass and a large salad . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed American films of the Forties : Spencer Tracy and Frank Capra never died here . In the evenings we would go to the house of our friend Francoise , and she would put on scandalous songs by Serge Gainsbourg . Two rooms full of people would go about their business of eating , laughing , talking , while the loudspeaker poured forth the prolonged ecstasies of a couple making slow and intense love . It was a very long summer . The heat began in early May and increased in intensity till by the end of July the Parisians fled the city in masses for the sea . We had the city to ourselves , except for the tourists . The cafes near the river were filled with voices from Atlanta , San Francisco , the Upper West Side of Manhattan . But the population at Eibrahim 's remained stable-the Tamils could not afford to go away on holiday and besides quite welcomed the heat . It may have been our imaginations , but the food seemed to get hotter as the summer progressed . When we went with Franroise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat for her sake . It was toward the end of one of those long days , when it seemed impossible that the light would ever go out of the sky , that Eibrahim sat down with us . There were about seven of us , and we had been eating and drinking for over three hours . We had run through the limited repertoire of his kitchen , and the Tamil woman in there had hung up her apron and gone home . But the beer was still flowing , and we were in an excellent mood . We offered to buy Eibrahim a beer . " I can not , " he said , indicating the white cap on his skull . " Mussulman . " " And yet you have no problems serving the devil 's drink to us unbelievers ! " said Jean . Eibrahim laughed and said , " Even in my country I ran a bar . " " What is your country ? " Franroise asked . Eibrahim put his hands on the table , crossed them , and finally responded , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from Vietnam . " " Do you still have family there ? " " Yes . " He was speaking very slowly . " I have . . . my wife is there , and my three children . I have not seen them since 1973 . Nineteen years . And four months . " No one was left in Eibrahim 's side of the cafe but us ; in the outside room a swarthy man stood at the counter drinking his beer in silence . All of a sudden the pinball machine in the cafe erupted in a staccato medley of sounds . No one was standing in front of it ; the machine was singing to the void . " It was because of the war ? " asked Fran , oise . " The war . " Eibrahim wiped his forehead with his hand . " Yes . You know , when I first met my wife she was only a baby . She was . . . she is my uncle 's daughter . We used to play in the street , in Saigon . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for twenty-five years I spent with her . So then , since 1973 I have not seen her . Do you know what it means ? It means that one day I see her , and then the soldiers come , and the next day I am in Paris and my life is completely different . Three children she gave me , two sons and a little daughter . But she is alive . She will come to me , of that I am sure . " " Why did you leave ? " asked Jean with his usual tactlessness . " Why did you abandon your wife and children ? " Eibrahim 's face jerked up . " It is none of your business , " he said , and stood up . He looked down at us , and we knew we would have to leave . After we left the restaurant , we walked around outside the Gare du Nord . It was a Tuesday night , and we were the only people out , but we were in such good spirits that we were a crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The buildings around the Gare du Nord are filled with immigrants ; it is as if having come off the train from their distant homes , they were so exhausted by the journey that they put bag and baggage down in the first empty room they saw . It is not a pretty area , and the noise of trains and cars consumes the neighborhood from an early hour . But maybe what keeps the immigrants in the area is the knowledge that the first door to home is just there , in the station , two blocks away . The energy of travelers is comforting , for it makes us feel that the whole world , like us , is transient . We were walking along the street when two Arab boys strode toward us very fast . They plunged right into the middle of our group , and Francoise gasped , whirled , and called out at their departing backs , " Salaud ! " The boys stopped , turned , and walked slowly toward us . Francoise and the boys started arguing vehemently . We gathered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past her . " I am Arabian and I can do what I want ! " said the boy to Francoise . There were only two of them , and there were four men in our group , but except for Jean we were all foreigners , and we could not follow the argument . Jean stood next to Francoise and grabbed the boy by the throat . At this , the boy 's friend pulled out a knife and slashed at Jean , cutting his arm . For a moment we all stopped , astounded , because now we had no knowledge of what we were supposed to do . The boys ran . We clustered around Jean helplessly as blood leaked out from his arm . But it was not very much blood , and it stopped soon . Somebody had BandAids in her purse , and we put a couple on Jean 's arm . We took the Metro to Les Halles in silence . Then somebody or the other joked about the incident and everyone laughed desperately . Out beside the fountain in Les Halles there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all felt better . There was a cafe open facing the fountain , and we sat on the terrace and drank and laughed . All around us were young Greeks , young Swedes , Koreans , Americans , Argentineans , Britons ; from all the continents of the world they had come to Paris with their backpacks and their savings from part-time and summer jobs as store clerks , apple pickers , temporary secretaries , and messengers . Now they could enjoy the fruits of their labor . They ate little but bread and cheese , stayed four to a room in miserable no-star hotels . Their frugality with money lasted during the day , but at night these young people spent fantastic amounts on drinks in expensive nightclubs and cafes-at night they saw the person with the enchanting smile sitting in the other corner of the room . It was the night they had wept and fasted , wept and prayed for . Then one day Eibrahim 's restaurant vanished . When we went to the cafe , after being out of the country for some months , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she now owned the whole place . No more masala dosas . But , the new owner also told us , we would find Eibrahim in his apartment , close by , and she gave us the address . Franroise was with us ; she wanted to see him . So we all went to the address and climbed the six flights to the top . We knocked . Eibrahim himself opened the door . He did not recognize us . Then we spoke to him in the few Tamil words we knew and he smiled . " Bonjour , " he said , opening the door . Eibrahim 's apartment was very small , very neat . We sat on the same chairs we used to sit on in his cafe . Francoise leaned forward . " We missed you , my friend . And your dosas . " Eibrahim rose . " I can not give you dosas here . The woman is gone . But you will have some tea ? " We consented and he went into the kitchen . We all turned , out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a courtyard and blue-gray rooftops , studded with red chimneys standing like sentries . It was very quiet here and none of us said a word , afraid we would say something so inconsequential it would be stupid , when the situation demanded the question we could not ask , could not even think to ourselves in the silences of our own minds : " What are we doing here ? " Eibrahim returned with the tea things on a tray , beautiful inlaid teacups from Vietnam , and he poured the tea for us . We asked why he had closed his restaurant . " I lost too much money , " he said solemnly . We all burst out laughing . It had been evident to everybody that Eibrahim was a lousy businessman : he undercharged his customers more often than not , he was always giving out free food " from the heart , " and the prices he charged could barely have covered his costs . He was surprised at our mirth , but then he laughed along with us . He confessed , " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He looked so comically despondent that we could n't stop laughing . " The Algerian madame of the cafe was kind . I owed her three months ' rent , which she did not collect . She told me I am welcome to come back to her cafe , but only to play pinball . " We laughed long and hard . We wiped the tears from our eyes and sipped the tea . " So what will you do now ? " Franroise asked him . Eibrahim treated her question with respect . He took his time , then he looked up and replied , " I must wait . My wife will come here . " He had made his choice . Of all the countries in the world he could go to , or return to , Eibrahim chose to stay here in this high room in Paris , and wait . We talked to him some more , and then we had to go . But Franroise wanted to stay . We said goodbye to her and to Eibrahim . It was January then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the very blue sky . When we walked , our footsteps echoed on the stone . It was a fine thing to get up very early and warm ourselves with a large bowl of chocolate at the corner tabac , and watch the tradesmen , deliverymen , and cleaning women come in and get cigarettes , papers , and coffee . Then we turned our attention to the International Herald Tribune and read with a pleasant sense of distance about the tumult back home . Outside the window we could see the stalls being set up for the market on the place . Jean came up to the table and sat down opposite . " Un petit noir , " he said to the waiter . " Have you spoken to Francoise ? " he asked . " She has been with Eibrahim for a month . She goes home to him . " Jean did not look as if he were happy with this development . We said nothing ; we did not need to . Jean had plenty to say for all of us . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A married man . . . with children also . And they are so completely different . I see nothing but sadness . Nothing but sadness to come out of this . " He shook his head , drank his coffee , threw a coin down on the table , and left to go to work . Jean worked in the Eighth , and the Eighth was a very different district from the Fifth , where all of us lived . Poor Jean could never make sense of the difference . We saw Francoise twice that winter , first alone and then with Eibrahim . The first time , a few of us went to listen to a Polish choir in L'Eglise St. Julien . Francoise closed her eyes during the music , swaying slightly with pleasure as the singers whispered , " Pax , pax , pax , " before breaking out into a tremendous " Amen " in time with the organ . She was smiling , and in that light her face was suffused with color ; she looked beautiful and fragile , as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she told us , " I did n't think it could happen to me . Really , I am so in love . " Again she could not help smiling , but she lifted her hand with the fork still in it to cover her face . Then she looked at us trying to conceal her smile , but we could see it in her eyes . We stopped eating and broke out in laughter . Someone raised his glass and we all clinked , twice , " Chin . Chin . " The second time , Francoise and Eibrahim had dinner at our apartment . He was very grave , and he ate with great decorum . It felt a little strange , we told him , for us to be feeding him . Our cooking had made the apartment feel quite warm . Through the opened window we could hear the buzzer of the door to the building below , and footsteps in the courtyard . There was Debussy on the radio and a bouquet of lilies on the table . Francoise and Eibrahim avoided touching each other , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were really sitting very close . When he spoke , her body would turn toward his . Frangoise had led a proper Sixteenth-Arrondissement life until she fell into our company . She told us about how , when she was growing up , she was ill for a time , and for a month every year she would be sent to St. Honore-les-Bains to take the waters . Her world was as exotic to us as if she had been raised on the steppes of Mongolia or the streets of Beirut , and we listened with interest . " When I am out of France , " she said , " all my thoughts are clearer , I am filled with curiosity , and I can make connections between random events . Even when I am away for very long , exile is tonic for me . toward him . He had finished his coffee , and rose from the table and walked over to the window . He was looking out , trying to see beyond the buildings , but the window only opened onto the courtyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his arms stretched out , holding the sides of the open window , his back to us . Francoise got up and went over to him , standing by him in silence , her eyes looking at his face . He said something to her , very softly , so that only she could hear , and she put her arm up and touched his shoulder . Many worlds met in that gesture , vast distances were shattered . That light touch was more intimate than the most passionate embrace , and all of us , the spectators , felt our hearts breaking . Then they turned back to face us and smiled , both at the same time . As they left , we presented Eibrahim with the rest of the cake he had so liked , wrapped up in a piece of foil , " from the heart . " He looked astonished for a moment , then he got the joke and laughed , very naturally . They went out into the cold , holding hands . One day in the spring his wife came to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he met her at the station , she had all their children with her , and they looked at Eibrahim with dark , luminous eyes . They stood on the platform for a moment , Eibrahim 's wife and children facing him , then he reached out and touched his eldest son on his head . His son stood still . Eibrahim withdrew his hand , and all of them walked down the platform toward the exit . We did not hear from either Francoise or Eibrahim for a long time after that . Eventually , we became worried about Francoise and decided to drop by her apartment . When she opened the door , we did n't recognize her for a moment , she had lost so much weight . She smelled strongly of cigarettes , and the apartment was filled with a blue haze . The first thing we did upon entering was to open the windows and let in the sun and the air . Francoise sat silently on the sofa , her head down . For the next hour , we cleaned her rooms thoroughly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor , and rearranged the books and CDs . When the place was more habitable , we poured some wine for Francoise and ourselves , and sat down with her on the sofa . We waited for her to speak . We had time . The afternoon sun came slanting and sneaking into the apartment , coloring our thoughts insidiously . We sipped the wine and looked out of the window at the clouds moving across the sky . The refrigerator motor stopped with a shudder , and we realized that we notice the absence of sound more than we notice sound itself . Silence is tangible ; you can run it between your hands like folds of silk . " You know , he has beautiful eyes , " Francoise said . " When he takes off his glasses , he has very beautiful eyes . " Then she was crying a little . There are people who come to Paris and never visit the Louvre or the Eiffel Tower . We were like that . The entire time we stayed in Paris , we went around these two monuments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed visitors to them , but we never went there ourselves . This was not a conscious decision . It was just that . . . these two landmarks were so much there . We had heard so much , read so much about them , seen them in so many films , that we felt we had experienced both without being in them . Maybe this is the process of understanding a love that is not yours . When we left Paris , a little while later , both Francoise and Eibrahim , arriving separately , came to see us off . We were taking the boat train to London from the Gare du Nord . They sat with us for one last coffee at the station cafe . People waited with their bags at the tables around us , listening to the messages echoing through the station . Some would go on to Belgium and Koln ; some had taken the night train from Moscow and were rousing themselves from the journey with a strong coffee , waiting for their relatives to come and claim them . Nobody in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in transit . The morning newspapers were filling up the racks in front of the tabac with urgent messages from all over the world . When the waiter brought our coffees , Eibrahim 's head dropped . Franroise understood immediately and gave the waiter a fifty-franc note for all of us . " When do you come to Paris again ? " she asked us . The situation seemed so normal , all of us sitting around a table talking as if nothing had changed , as if it were the previous summer . And , in fact , Eibrahim 's former restaurant was not two minutes ' walk from where we were sitting ; we could all so easily go there , forget everything , and sit down to a meal of dosas and idlis and a couple of beers . We let Francoise 's question lie on the table between us ; we could not answer it . And she knew that , for immediately after asking it , she leaned back in her chair . She had made her effort . Now she was very tired . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eibrahim . He reached into his jacket and came out with a small package badly wrapped in a red-andgreen paper that had " Joyeux Noel " written all over it . The little present was a heart ; that is , a clear plastic model of the human heart , showing , in different colors , all the multiple arteries , veins , chambers , and valves . Accompanying it was a little booklet titled " The Illustrated Heart , " which explained in scientific detail the parts of the heart and their functions . As we held the heart , and all of us looked closely at it , it seemed almost to throb with life . " It is such a complicated thing , the heart , " explained Eibrahim . " No , it is not , " said Francoise . " To me it is very simple . " She was not looking at anybody , but her palms were open on her lap as if they were a book and she was trying hard to read what was written on them . Or maybe she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was a vast silence , shadows between the seconds . Everythingall questions , answers , and possibilities-was suspended . Then Eibrahim leaned forward and gently covered Francoise 's palms with his . Our train was called and we stood up to leave . It was cloudy , threatening to rain . Ten minutes out of the station the train slowed , then stopped altogether , in the desolation . All around us were housing projects . Brown faces looked out at us from some of the windows . The faces stared at us without moving , looking at the stalled train . Then , summoning up some last reserve of will from the depths of its being , the train lurched forward , and we were once again on our way .
