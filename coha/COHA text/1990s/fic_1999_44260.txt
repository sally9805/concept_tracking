For a Black woman in bondage , keeping faith with her own heart and having her man and children near could be as elusive as freedom itself <p> AMID THE WEARINESS OF WORKDAY 'S END , Sarah-Bell savored the quiet of oncoming twilight . Lilting into the breezeless amber of the October evening , a mesmerizing wordless song flowed from her full , plum-colored lips as she plodded down the dusty lane . Her ankle-length , sweatsoiled skirt swished with each step . Beside Sarah-Bell , **29;28;TOOLONG one hundred-eighty-seven pound Jim One-Toe hobbled along , deftly dragging his maimed left foot . One-Toe smiled in admiration of the way Sarah-Bell ended each phrase of her improvised reel on a little upward swoop that just naturally made a man feel good . " Sarah-Bell , you sing so pretty . Can I be your man ? " Sarah-Bell furtively peeked over at One-Toe , smiled and immediately refocused her gaze on the last visible tip of the orange sun swiftly falling behind the nearly clean-picked field of cotton plants . " One-Toe , you know I got a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time , " One-Toe retorted . A quick grin flashed across the dimpled midnight of his handsome blue-black face . Almost two good moons had passed since anybody had seen Mule-Boy visiting Sarah-Bell . Gathering was most over ; Mule coulda been sold off by now-everybody knowed Master Gilmore over to the next plantation was good for sending you down the river at the drop of a hat . Sarah-Bell scrutinized the squinting sincerity in OneToe 's eyes . " It air ; t that he do n't . He ca n't co ... " Suddenly interrupting herself , she hiked up her skirt as she stepped around a fresh pile of horse droppings . Then , shooing away a fat green-and-black fly with a quick fan of her field-toughened hand , she picked up her thought , " ... and you could n't be with me every night neither , that is , if'n I was to even let you come by at all . " One-Toe was encouraged that Sarah-Bell was at least considering the merits of being with him . He spied a glimmer of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Naw . I do n't think so , One-Toe . I thinks I can wait . " " Yes , ma'am . " One-Toe was disappointed , but not discouraged . He had plenty days ahead to blow gently on the spark he glimpsed in Sarah-Bell 's pecan-shaped eyes . He reckoned harvesting the love of a woman like this was worth a long season of planting and weeding . " But if you was to get tired a waiting . I would come . You know I would . Like a bird to the nest . I would come to you every night I could . " " Photograph <p> " Which make you no different from my far-away man who come to me every night he can . " " Well , do n't forget I 'm closer to the nest . I can get to you quicker than him , even if'n I ai n't got but one good foots , " One-Toe joked . Sarah-Bell grinned as One-Toe made fun of his own infirmity . She liked his gentle humor but she did n't feel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a fine man like One-Toe . Sarah-Bell gracefully waved to One-Toe and spoke in a husky half-whisper as she strolled on , " Good night , brotha One-Toe . " One-Toe peered longingly at the broadness of SarahBell 's back and the ampleness of her hips . He looked til his imagination was as full as it could stand to be . One-Toe wanted that pretty-singing woman . He had seen a bunch of women who was face-prettier , but he had never heard no one or nothing what sang prettier than Sarah-Bell . One-Toe had been thinking so hard about holding SarahBell in his huge am-is , he missed catching sight of the White man , Chester Browne , squatting nearby her door . When her singing faltered and then abruptly fell silent , One-Toe quickly surveyed the area to see what disturbance had stilled Sarah-Bell 's song . One-Toe glared at Chester , who was the plantation overseer . Everybody knowed what a driverman in the lane after hours waiting by a woman 's door meant . One-Toe spat into the dust , turned and drug himself into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he heard the thudding shuffle of Chester 's horse moseying past the open doorway as Chester and Sarah-Bell rode out the lane . A high-pitched whinny from the horse taunted OneToe , but he refused to look up at the too-familiar abduction . One-Toe forcefully buried his face in the gritty dirt floor and stifled an urge to say something , anything-a word , a sound , her name . Chester was n't talking , and Sarah-Bell was n't singing . The chomp chomp chomp chomp of the sorrel 's hooves echoed against the mud-caked wall of One-Toe 's sleep space and reverberated inside his skull . Sarah-Bell 's silence tormented One-Toe . He would gladly let them ax-chop his good right foot if'n he could visit her  --  Chester or no Chester . Naw , ifn he had a cooing dove like Sarah-Bell to share nights with , he would n't even dream of running again . An hour later Chester had finished his business . Since he never kept any washing water in his cabin , and Sarah-Bell had not even dared think about going down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself with her skirt tail before she set off to walking back . Her general habit was to immediately forget the weight of the overseer as he flu-ashed into her , but Sarah-Bell found herself mulling over her plight . Her thoughts were accompanied by the crunch of her footfalls on the loamy trail . Maybe she should brave a trek over to Gilmore 's and plead with Mama Zulie for some womb-cleaning chawing roots . Sarah-Bell paused and fleetingly hugged herself I sure hope nothing that drastic is needed . Probably not . Her regular bleeding had just stopped a day or so ago . But even though she was aware that Chester 's drool could do her no hann , it sure was a mighty aggravation the way the taste of his kiss sometimes seemed to stay in her mouth for days . Luckily , on this particular night , he had mostly wanted to suck at her nipples rather than her lips . Plus , he was done quickly enough . It had n't been too long fore Chester dozed off and Sarah-Bell had been able to scoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walking the three quarters of a mile back to the lane . By the time she was most halfway there , Sarah-Bell had managed to bury Chester 's assault and summon up a plaintive song to soften the knot of jumbled sorrow resting heavy in the bottom of her stomach . Shortly , for the second time , the soles of Sarah-Bell 's thickly callused feet felt the well-worn familiarity of the lane 's path . She was welcomed back by the sleeping-sounds of her people . Snores . Whistles . Sobs . Groans . A few moans from someone sick , or from someone really tired , or maybe both . Sarah-Bell was too exhausted to stumble 50 more yards down to the creek for to wash herself She would do that in the morning . And though she was hungry , she was also too fatigued to gnaw on the piece of hardtack that was secreted deep in the pocket of her skirt . Right now she needed to lay down by herself and seek the solace of sleep so she could disremember the dog-odor of Chester 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seems like smell and taste had more staying power even than the abuse of touch . Sarah-Bell 's sharp ears caught the faint sound of some animal moving in the woods . judging from the swift lightness of the rustling coming from the bushes , she guessed it must be a rabbit . An owl hooted . Sarah-Bell wordlessly empathized with the prey-run , brother rabbit , less you be somebody 's supper . Times like this Sarah-Bell wished she was brave enough to hightail it like One-Toe had done . Maybe she would make it to Mexico , which is where One-Toe said he had been headed . Sarah-Bell thought of what One-Toe had declared when they brought him back : Some gets away , some do n't . Getting free was worth the risk , worth losing some of a foot . She flinched at the thought of so permanent a loss . Even though she had survived more than her share of suffering , SarahBell still did n't know if she could stand one of her limbs being mutilated or cut away . Sarah-Bell was too drained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't even crawl over to check on her children balled together in slumber beneath a patchwork spread of sackcloth and shirt pieces . No sooner had her darkhaired head nestled onto the curved comfort of her pillow-stone , than she was dead asleep . The next day , in the pale dim of half-dawn morning light , only one child sat where two usually fidgeted . Sarah-Bell 's heart dropped . " Where Suzee-Bell ? " " Them took her , " Johnny-Bell replied . Was no need to say who " them " was . Was no need to ask " where " they took her . We ai n't got nothing but each other , and they wo n't let us hold on to that , Sarah-Bell 's insides roiled with anger . Both man and God was unfair . Man for what he was doing . And God for allowing men to act the low-down way they did . Sarah-Bell knew Johnny-Bell would be next . She knew it just as sure as she knew a snake would eat an unprotected egg . Johnny-Bell was her fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Johnny ... " the child stuttered , frightened by the hissed intensity of his mother 's question . " Naw . Yo name Johnny-Bell . BELL . You Johnny-Bell . Yo brothers is Robert-Bell and Joe-Bell . Your sisters is Urzie-Bell and Suzee-Bell . No matter where they cart you off to , no matter what they call you by , you remember the name yo mama give you , boy . And if you ever hear tell of yo brothers or yo sisters , you go find " em if you can . But you remember " em even if you ca n't find " em . You remember yo people . You hear me ? " " Yes , ma'am . " The confused 4-year-old wet himself He had never heard his mother speak so harshly to him ; but he did n't cry . When she realized how hard she was shaking him , SarahBell softened her grip on Johnny-Bell 's shoulder . Her rage was n't making this crisis any easier for him . She could feel currents of fear in his little body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Within seconds Sarah-Bell reined in her emotions , mustered up her fortitude and tenderly enfolded Johnny-Bell into the shelter of her bosom . They swayed in mutual anguish as she sought to rock away his fear and her grief . Instinctively she handled her predicament as best she knew how . Within seconds of hugging Johnny-Bell , SarahBell was breathing out a long-toned lullaby and anointing the reddish-brown hair of her son 's head with song-embellished kisses . And she did n't loosen her embrace until she heard the rooster crow for day . After emerging into the muted shine of daybreak , hand-in-hand , mother and child marched down to the water to bathe themselves . Word about Suzee-Bell buzzed through the small community . just before leaving for the fields , glassy-eyed and scowling , Sarah-Bell stood in the middle of the lane sullenly declaring her determination . " Y'all , hear me . Every time I have one , they take and sell em away . Sarah-Bell is through birthing , babies . No matter who lay down with me , ai n't no mo babies coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bear me . Done . " And with the finality of her words resounding in everyone 's ears , Sarah-Bell whirled and commenced to trudging off to the field . One-Toe scrambled to catch up to her . Without breaking stride , Sarah-Bell closely examined OneToe 's unblinking gaze . Satisfied with what she saw , she gave a quick nod and gratefully accepted the respectful silence of his company . She started singing , quietly at first but more forcefully as they sauntered on . The irresistible refrain of Sarah-Bell 's song syncopated their gait . Together , they would face another day .
