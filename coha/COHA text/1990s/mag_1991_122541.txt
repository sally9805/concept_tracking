The apparently joyless career of Henry Aaron puts an athletic spin on the Shakespearean saw about being " star-crossed . " One star or another was always getting in Hank 's way . First , it was Willie Mays outshining him , at least in the public eye , during Aaron 's best seasons , seasons as fine as anyone has ever had . Then , as he stood on the very brink of baseball immortality , here came the Babe himself , or at least his ghost , to steal his thunder . The only place Aaron could finish first , it seemed , was in the alphabetical listings of The Baseball Encyclopedia . If anyone has a right to sing the blues , it 's the man they called the Hammer , and sing them he does , with a vengeance , in I Had a Hammer ( HarperCollins , $21.95 ) , an autobiography written with Cincinnati journalist Lonnie Wheeler . It is an unsettling read . // Aaron was a cross-handed-hitting teenage infielder from Mobile , Ala. , when the Braves signed him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the last big leaguers to emerge from that suddenly disintegrating talent pool . After a season in the lower minors at Eau Claire , Wis. , he was dispatched with a few other young blacks to integrate the South Atlantic " Sally " League in the Deep South . His reception from fans there ranged from merely insulting catcalls  --  " Hey nigger , why you runnin ' ? There 's no watermelon out there "  --  to crudely written death threats . Still , Aaron , as focused and coolly methodical a player as ever swung a bat , tore the league apart . The next year , 1954 , at age 20 , he was in the big time . Being with the Milwaukee Braves in the 1950s was as near to nirvana as he would ever be . The team was on its way to winning two National League pennants and a World Series , the fans were ecstatic and plentiful , and most of his teammates were great guys , particularly his slugging mate , Eddie Mathews . Aaron responded to all this salubrity by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and RBIs four times . // But those good times were too good to last . The Braves slipped badly , both on the field and at the box office , and in 1966 they moved to  --  where else ?  --  the Deep South . Atlanta considered itself to be a progressive city , far too busy expanding its horizons to be racially prejudiced , but Aaron found it otherwise . By this time , he , unlike Mays , had become outspoken on the subject of race , and he rubbed the tender sensibilities of this allegedly reformed community the wrong way . // Unheralded elsewhere and disliked at home , Aaron nevertheless kept hammering away , and when he finally passed Mays in the career home run derby-leaving only Babe Ruth ahead of him  --  he took the baseball world by surprise . What was this stoic man doing in such charismatic company ? It was bad enough that he had passed the popular Willie ; now he was nearing the sacred Babe 's unapproachable lifetime record of 714 home runs . In 1973 , as the Hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " letters , as he calls them , began pouring in  --  " Dirty old nigger man .... Had Babe Ruth played and been at bat as many times as you , old nigger , he would have hit just short of 1,100 home runs .... " Aaron collected the most scurrilous of these disgusting missives to remind him in years ahead of his tremendous ordeal . Altogether , according to the U.S. Postal Service , he received 930,000 letters in ' 73 , by far the most sent to a nonpolitician . Dinah Shore finished second , with 60,000 . " It should have been the most enjoyable time in my life , " he writes , " and instead it was hell . " // Aaron missed tying the Babe that year by one homer . He could conceivably have gotten the record within the first three games of ' 74 , all of which were to be played in Cincinnati . The Braves wanted to hold him out of those three games so he could pass Ruth at home , but commissioner Bowie Kuhn ordered Atlanta to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What was to have been his crowning achievement was already sullied by controversy . And when killer tornadoes struck the countryside around Cincinnati on Opening Day , he was further upstaged by tragedy . He went ahead and hit number 714 anyway . And in the home opener , off the Dodgers ' Al Downing , he hit the record breaker . " I felt a deep sense of gratitude , " he writes , " and a wonderful surge of liberation all at the same time . I also felt a stream of tears running down my face . " When President Nixon , awash in Watergate , tried to telephone his congratulations , he was accidentally disconnected . Commissioner Kuhn was n't even in the ballpark. // At 57 , Aaron tells us , he 's still fighting for respect , both for himself and for all African-Americans . And yet it 's significant , perhaps , that the most famous Hammer in America today is a rap singer .                   @ @
