The belief that music can provide emotional salvation is in short supply in rock ' n ' roll these days . Old records by groups like U2 convey the feeling , and so do some recent releases by younger acts like New Radicals . Thankfully , the notion also comes across on the latest CD by the British band Manic Street Preachers . The group offers up big , melodic , cathedral-filling songs that clearly have social and spiritual aspirations beyond just rocking the house : one of the tracks is bluntly titled If You Tolerate This Your Children Will Be Next . A few numbers are a bit limp , but when this group is on , it can make you believe that rock is sacred . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
