<p> The best wine and food match also is the simplest - throw some wine in the sauce and drink the rest . <p> The whole meal falls into balance when you cook with and drink the same wine . It 's a subtle , insistent harmony : A sip of wine reveals flavors in the food ; a bite of food underscores the character of the wine . <p> It also makes sense when there are two wine drinkers in the family . A 750-milliliter bottle of wine can lend one cupful to the sauce and then divvy up into a glass and a half for each designated drinker . <p> The trick , of course , is to find a wine that 's cheap enough to cook with and good enough to drink . ( I 've made some suggestions in today 's Wine &; Spirits column . ) Next , match the grape varietal with complementary flavors - herbs , spices and other ingredients that bring out the characteristic best in the varietal . <p> Here are some ideas for sauces to accompany a variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter with wild mushrooms and shallots is a takeoff on beurre rouge - a classic French sauce made by whisking soft butter into reduced red wine . <p> Beurre rouge ( the name means " red butter " ) often pairs with full-flavored varieties of seafood . The mild astringency of the tannins in the red wine does a marvelous job of cutting the oiliness of salmon or the richness of lobster . <p> I prepare it with pinot noir because the softly feminine but earthy style favored by pinot bottlers often makes a delightful , unexpected match with seafood . In this recipe , the mustiness of the mushrooms and sweetness of the shallots help to further the cause , bridging the flavors of fish and wine . <p> I think a broiled or sauteed salmon fillet is ideal for this sauce , but I would n't hesitate to serve it with swordfish , tuna or lobster . Or roast chicken , sauteed pork loin or leg of lamb , for that matter . <p> This versatile sauce also gladly accepts variations , such as crumbles of bacon , gorgonzola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve it with meat or poultry , a little minced rosemary adds a fragrant whiff of heaven . <p> While I 've been making variations on red wine butter for years , riesling vinaigrette is a recent discovery . Because this noble white grape varietal has a distinctive flavor reminiscent of apples , it goes well with apple-loving foods like walnuts , cloves and mustard . ( If the latter choice surprises you , find a recipe for pork loin with apple cider and mustard - pure glory . ) <p> The recipe I developed combines very reduced spiced riesling with mustard , shallots and walnut oil . Plenty of chopped fresh dill finishes the sauce because riesling has a flowery bite that mirrors dill cannily . <p> Try this vinaigrette on poached chicken breasts , broiled medium-flavored fish such as snapper , trout or tilapia , a plateful of steamed veggies , or a lettuce salad containing slivered Granny Smith apple and topped with hot slices of roasted pork tenderloin . A few chopped toasted walnuts sprinkled atop add the final touch . <p> Flush with my riesling success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a rich reduction sauce to serve with steaks and roasts . Chefs throughout the country favor merlot in their brown sauces for its appropriately soft texture - velvet wine in a satin sauce . <p> I modified Madeleine Kamman 's quick technique for reducing canned broth over well-browned meat scrap . Because there was n't a scrap of anything in my fridge , I bought some inexpensive beef stew meat . <p> But I used canned chicken broth rather than beef broth . Natural and health-food brands of chicken broth have the depth of flavor and mildly gelatinous texture that come only from simmering real bones . <p> When it reduces , it thickens and intensifies in a pleasing way . Beef broth , on the other hand , is almost always something called " beef extract " diluted in water . Reduce it and you end up with a bouillon cube . <p> Try the merlot reduction with roast beef , sauteed tournedos , leg of lamb , roast chicken or even peppered swordfish . It gladly accepts chopped herbs , mushrooms or strips of roasted red pepper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , were less than successful . <p> Well-made sauvignon blanc is the most food-friendly of wines - cleanly acidic , complex enough to stand up to sauces and possessing a distinctive herbaceousness that can make a flavor bridge to many herbs , spices and other flavorings . I 've found it an excellent match with complexly seasoned Asian and Southwestern dishes . <p> So I tried to combine it with complementary flavors in a couple of offbeat creations . But it was completely swamped in a cucumber-cilantro vinaigrette , and it reduced down to a cloying ickiness in a tomatillo-yellow pepper chutney . Avail was not mine . <p> I 'm going to keep trying , but for now I 'll stick to more traditional uses for this wine , such as a simple lemon-thyme beurre blanc . A perfectly fresh fillet of broiled fish could find no better sauce . <p> And no better wine to wash it down . <p> PINOT NOIR BUTTER <p> WITH WILD <p> MUSHROOMS <p> AND SHALLOTS <p> 1/2 to 3/4 cup mixed wild mushrooms ( oyster , cremini , chanterelle , shiitake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cut into 1-tablespoon pieces <p> 1 large shallot , peeled and cut into 1/8-inch cross sections <p> 1 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme leaves ( or 1/2 teaspoon dried ) <p> 2/3 cup good pinot noir <p> Salt and pepper to taste <p> Brush mushrooms clean , trim bottoms and prepare as follows : Halve chanterelles , quarter creminis , trim stems from shiitakes and cut into 1/3-inch slices , separate oysters , slice lobsters into 1/8-inch sections . <p> Heat 1 tablespoon butter in saute pan over medium-high flame until bubbling .
