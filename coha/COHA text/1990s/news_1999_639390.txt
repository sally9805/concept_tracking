<p> This is a tale of two cities in Colorado 's ski country . <p> Or , at least , two villages . <p> This season , Winter Park and Copper Mountain ski areas will unveil multimillion-dollar , base-area villages with new shops , restaurants and - most importantly - beds . If any two resorts in Colorado have spruced up this much before at the same time , nobody seems to recall it . <p> In the economics of the ski and snowboarding business , in which people who stay overnight spend more than three times the amount shelled out by day-trippers , beds are big . <p> ' Both resorts have altered their futures in a way that will probably enhance the experience for the skier , ' said Michael Berry , president of the National Ski Areas Association , a trade organization based in Lakewood . ' To some extent , this will convert people who might have considered themselves day visitors to overnight visitors . ' <p> An overnight visitor spends roughly $ 189 per day , compared with a day-time skier or snowboarder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ski Country USA figures . <p> So resorts across the country are continually investing big bucks , building up their base areas . In Colorado , ski-resort owners are spending $ 233 million this season - a record amount - on new facilities and improvements on and around their mountains . The old record , $ 157 million , was spent in 1998-99 . <p> Most of that is being spent on base development . And more than half of that total can be attributed to Winter Park and Copper . Winter Park 's village developer , Hines , invested nearly $ 90 million erecting two lodges with 230 condominium units and first-floor retail and restaurant space . <p> Copper completed the $ 66 million , 108-unit Copper Springs Lodge and the Copper Station day lodge in its ' east village . ' Under construction to open the following season are four condominium buildings in the core of the village that will add 215 units to the mix . <p> The buildings are part of a $ 500 million investment that Intrawest Corp. , Copper 's owner , says it plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Having two major ski resorts in one state make improvements of this magnitude at the same time is unprecedented , Berry said . Especially two resorts that compete so closely for Front Range business . <p> ' Is there a parallel elsewhere in the ( ski-resort ) universe ? ' Berry said . ' Not really . ' <p> The build-out of these second homes also speaks to the strength of the real-estate market in Colorado 's ski resorts , Berry said . Late last week , Winter Park had three condos left for sale . <p> Copper sold its first phase of 108 condos in six hours . The 215 units under construction also are sold out . <p> The buyers reflect somewhat different followings for the resorts . <p> At Winter Park , 78 percent of the buyers of the new condominiums live in Colorado . The other 22 percent are scattered between Minnesota , Illinois , Texas , Kansas and Florida . Prices ranged from $ 189,900 for a one-bedroom unit to $ 800,000 for a penthouse . <p> At Copper , 55 percent of the new-condo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail from the Midwest . Prices in Copper Springs Lodge ranged from $ 194,900 for a studio to $ 599,900 for a three-bedroom unit . <p> Units in the four Copper buildings under construction started at $ 169,900 for a studio to $ 949,900 for a three-bedroom . <p> David Barry , Copper 's chief operating officer , calls the construction crane the official bird of Copper Mountain . <p> From the deck outside his office , Barry has closely watched the giant cranes swing steel into place to create the four buildings coming out of the ground . These condominium buildings - Base One , The Mill Club , Crossroads Inn and Tucker Mountain Lodge - will frame the core of the village when they open in the 2000-01 ski season . <p> It 's the largest construction project that Intrawest has undertaken , Barry said . Intrawest , a Canadian real-estate and ski-resort developer , also owns Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia and Mount Tremblant in Quebec . <p> The Canadian resort company also shares half interest in River Run , a village at the base of Keystone mountain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sold out last year in six hours , have a decor and layout similar to the Intrawest-built condos in River Run . <p> But Barry insists that Copper wo n't become a Keystone knock-off . <p> ' If we make our retail and restaurants like Keystone and Breckenridge , this village will fail , ' Barry said . <p> In Colorado 's competitive ski-industry climate , the key is differentiation , Barry said . Each resort has to offer terrain , lodging , shopping and dining that distinguish itself from the competition . <p> ' Copper 's strength is it 's the skier 's mountain , ' said Bob Kunkel , a Vail-based ski-industry consultant . ' It certainly was n't the shopper 's mountain or the gourmet 's mountain . Now , here comes Copper with a legitimate signature base where buildings have condos and nice restaurants and they 've stepped up to their vision as a resort . ' <p> Kunkel worked as an executive for eight years at Copper and 12 years at Winter Park . Intrawest , because of its ability to raise money in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cash that Copper 's former owner , Tony Novelly , could n't . <p> Gary DeFrange , Winter Park 's chief executive officer , still shakes his head when he looks at the massive buildings rising above him . <p> The Zephyr Mountain Lodge , two condominium buildings on the east side of the base area near the Zephyr chair lift , should open in January or February . The seven- and eight-story buildings have dramatically changed the look and scale of Winter Park 's base village . <p> ' I just wish I could wave a magic wand and have the whole village done , ' DeFrange said wistfully . The fence surrounding the construction site will be down by opening day of the ski season , scheduled for Nov. 17 . <p> The collection of construction trailers taking up parking spaces will be moved or removed . A casual-dining restaurant on the main floor of the Zephyr Lodge Riverside will be getting ready to feed hungry skiers and riders . A ski store will be stocking up for shoppers . <p> Most significantly , travelers calling a central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they asked if Winter Park had ski-in , ski-out lodging , will hear ' yes . ' <p> ' Now they 're able to meet the needs of that segment of the market , ' Kunkel said . ' So frequently you find that people want to eat , sleep and stay at the base of the mountain . ' <p> Winter Park wo n't realize an increase in revenues unless visitors ski , eat , rent equipment or shop there . Unlike Copper , Winter Park , owned by the city and county of Denver , sold its real estate to Hines . <p> Some ski-industry experts look at beds and see a cushion against patchy snow seasons , such as the last one , in which the state saw a 5.29 percent drop in skier visits - the largest single season decline since 1980-81 . A skier day represents one lift ticket given or sold to a skier or snowboarder for one day . <p> Both resorts already are strong with international visitors , Berry said . But the new base-area lodging could bring even more customers from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the international arena , but this could solve some problems for them , ' Berry said . ' For both resorts , it relieves the travel anxiety for folks coming from Europe who love the idea of ski-in and ski-out accommodations . It could result in a couple more percentage points increase in international business . ' <p> Winter Park recently announced movement toward phase two of the village development . Hines probably will be the developer , DeFrange said , but that 's yet to be decided . <p> Officials at Copper and Winter Park say they will watch the real-estate market to decide when the time is right to build more condos . <p> ' We 're responding to the market and seeing what we need to do to retain the market share we have , ' DeFrange said . ' We have the opportunity to gain market share by creating this village . '
