WHEN we think of Black inventors , names like Garrett Morgan and George Washington Carver usually come to mind . But there are many modern-day inventors who have been responsible for groundbreaking developments that have changed America and the world . From Mark Dean 's cutting edge work in computer technology at IBM to chemist Michel Molaire 's innovations at Eastman Kodak , African-Americans have played an integral role in some of the most important creations of recent time . And while there are only three Blacks in the National Inventors Hall of Fame , Joanne M. Hayes-Rines , president of United Inventors Association of USA , says the facts speak for themselves . " Everyone always thinks of an inventor as an old White man , but women and Blacks are also out there following dreams , " Hayes-Rines says . " They are making significant contributions to society . " Among these inventors of dreams are the men and women on the following pages . Dennis Weatherby ( left ) created the lemon formula in Cascade dishwashing liquid while working as a process engineer at Procter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now the basis for the composition of all " lemon " cleaning products that contain bleach . He discovered a unique category of dyes that successfully gives a non-staining yellow color to detergents that contain bleach . Before Weatherby 's creation , pigments that stained dishes and dishwasher parts were used instead of dyes . Weatherby , 38 , is now the director of minority engineering programs at Auburn University in Alabama . Mark Dean has been one of the masterminds behind IBM 's computer technology for the last two decades . He is best known for creating ( along with IBM colleague Dennis Moeller ) the ISA systems bus , an interface that allows multiple devices , such as a modem and printer , to be connected to a personal computer . Created in 1984 , ISA now is used in every computer built today . The electrical engineer holds more than 20 patents , including three of IBM 's original nine PC patents . Last year , Dean received the Black Engineer of the Year President 's Award , the Ronald H. Brown Innovators Award and became only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall of Fame . Director of IBM 's Austin , Texas , research laboratory , Dean is also an IBM Fellow , the first and only Black to achieve the company 's highest honor , and one of only 50 fellows among IBM 's 200,000 employees . Tanya Allen received a patent for disposable underwear that she hopes will revolutionize the female and male hygiene market . Made from an inexpensive rayon , non-woven material and a patented pouch , Forever Fresh Disposable Panties were initially developed for women to wear during menstruation . But now it is being marketed to men ( in boxer and brief styles ) and women for various medical uses , including incontinence and post-operative recovery . A native if Detroit , Allen has already secured contracts with labor and delivery departments at several hospitals , including The Detroit Medical Center and Botsford Hospital . The mother of four recently quit her job as a manager of a grocery store to work full-time on her invention . Betty Harris has more than 20 years of experience in scientific research and development . A pioneer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known for patenting a spot test for an explosive called TATB . The chemist works for the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , where she received the state 's Governor 's Trailblazer Award . Michel Molaire has played an integral role in groundbreaking innovations at Eastman Kodak for more than 20 years . The chemist is a research associate and project manager at Kodak in New York . A native of St. Marc , Haiti , Molaire is the recipient of 28 U.S. patents and more than 65 foreign patents for his work in material sciences . Much of Molaire 's work has been in the area of laser printing and optical recording . In 1984 , he received the Eastman Kodak Research Laboratories C.E.K. Mees Award for excellence in scientific research and reporting , and later was inducted into the company 's Distinguished Inventor 's Gallery . He is one of the top patentholders at Kodak . Paul Brown is one of the most prolific inventors of recent time . Now 81 , Brown has more than 20 patents , but is best known for creating the Whizzzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world 's best-selling toys . First marketed by Mattel in 1970 , the top is a perennial favorite among children and has become as popular as the yo-yo and the Frisbee , with annual sales topping more than 1 million items . Brown came up with the idea for the Whizzzer , after attempting to continuously spin a cumbersome , string-activated top for his 4-year-old nephew . Believing there had to be an easier way , Brown worked on a new top in his home for about a week before coming up with the Whizzzer in 1967 . Today , he continues to get royalties from the top , which is now marketed by Duncan . Dawn Francis invented a fertilizer to help food and plants grow larger . The molecular scientist calls her nutrient Way-t-GRO ! , a single molecule compound fashioned from non-toxic , all-organic components . A native of Detroit , Francis received a patent in 1990 for her fertilizer . Founder and curator of The Black Inventions Museum , Lady Sala S. Shabazz has been recording the achievements of African-American inventors since 1988 . Based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , churches and cultural gatherings throughout the United States and Africa in an effort to display " the magnificent contributions of African people throughout the world , " she says .
