Buying Off North Korea In responding to North Korea 's nuclear program , the U.S. has several options  --  none of them appealing . <p> THE Korean problem poses more than one difficulty of foreign-policy analysis . Aside from the central question of what to do about the unsettling possibility of a nuclear-armed rogue regime , one has to ask questions about one 's own government . Hypothetical solutions serve little purpose if they can not be executed . In this case , a policy of confrontation , which might ultimately lead to war on the Korean peninsula , would have to be executed by an Administration that has been hesitant and often inept in its handling of the American military . It is , moreover , an Administration that has ( in its own mind , at any rate ) divided its relations with Asian countries into compartments . The Clinton Administration appears to believe that confrontations with Japan over trade or China over human rights will have no effect on the willingness of those countries to cooperate with the U.S. on security matters . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furthermore , our Korean policy does not start with a blank slate . For several years now the United States has been unable to manage the problem of North Korean nuclear ambitions . Several Administrations have been tempted to withdraw forces from the peninsula , and it was George Bush , not Bill Clinton , who began pulling nuclear weapons out of South Korea . Thus , although the Clinton Administration may have handled Korea badly , it is not clear that its predecessor handled it much better . Nor is it clear that there are any good options on the Korean peninsula . Broadly speaking , there are four possible policies : a pre-emptive attack ; a hard squeeze , including a willingness to risk war ; isolation and containment , accompanied by an effort to minimize the chances of active fighting ; and a drive for a settlement with the North Koreans . <p> The first policy may be dismissed out of hand . Not only would this Administration simply refuse to do it , but also the dangers of radioactive contamination and the regional diplomatic repercussions would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently oppose such action and virtually certain that the Japanese and Chinese would . Nor can we assume that our knowledge is adequate to allow us to conduct such operations with the precision and completeness required . In the Persian Gulf , American war planners entered the conflict with a list of two certain and one possible nuclear targets ; by the time the UN inspectors had done their work after the war , they had a list of two dozen major facilities . <p> The second policy , the hard squeeze , would lead the United States to deliver an ultimatum to the North Koreans : give up your nuclear weapons , or face unremitting American pressure on Japan and China to sever economic ties . The squeeze would be accompanied by reinforcement of American troops on the Korean peninsula , and it would mean subordinating other foreign-policy objectives ( human rights in China , removal of trade barriers in Japan ) to our policy in Korea . It would require an immediate foreign-policy offensive to gain the necessary support . It would run the risk of provoking a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's local allies embittered at paying the price for American antipathy to nuclear proliferation . <p> The third option is a variant of the second : squeeze the hermit kingdom by quietly working on the Japanese and Chinese to curtail trade , but without publicly speaking of a crisis . Make it clear that the nuclear program must be curtailed on American terms , although in return North Korea might get some relief from its diplomatic isolation , perhaps even American recognition . <p> The fourth option is simply one of bribery . Offer the North Koreans whatever it takes in order to get them to scale back or stop their nuclear program . If that includes large-scale financial aid or even the building of a new nuclear-power reactor or two for them ( a proposal currently favored by the Clinton Administration ) , so be it . Poor Menu <p> UNFORTUNATELY , the options are almost equally unappetizing . The risks of war are clear ; the risks of the two more peaceful options , less so . One way to think about the situation is to consider what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped in its tracks . The North Koreans may now have one or more nuclear weapons , with the potential for half a dozen more if they begin reprocessing the fuel rods currently sitting in cooling tanks . The North Koreans have been steadily , and with moderate success , developing missiles with which to deliver nuclear weapons . What might happen next ? <p> Start with the best possible outcome , which is that the North Koreans fall in line with American policy . Even if successful , the Clinton Administration 's current approach sets an appalling precedent : violate the nuclear nonproliferation treaty , and the United States will oblige by pleading with its allies to buy you nuclear reactors . Moreover , although these nuclear reactors produce less weapon-grade material than ones designed for that purpose , they none-theless produce some . And given the longstanding North Korean practice of evasion , deception , and stonewalling , the proposition that this solution would mean the end of Korea 's nuclear ambitions should strain our credulity . <p> The North Korean regime has a long and consistent history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program does a lot for North Korea 's leaders . Without nuclear weapons , the country is merely an Asian Rumania before the fall ; with nuclear weapons , it has half a dozen wealthy countries courting it , dangling large sums of money . It also has the psychological payoff that comes from confronting the United States and appearing to win , or at least not lose too badly  --  a phenomenon that helps account for the decades-long pleasure taken by Fidel Castro in tweaking Uncle Sam 's nose . <p> Nor is it plausible to expect a South African outcome , the dismantling of nuclear weapons by a reformist regime . South Africa 's nuclear program never offered any real strategic benefit to that country . The threat to South Africa 's security came from insurrection , not invasion ; none of its neighbors  --  not even Angola while the Cuban troops were there  --  posed anything like a serious conventional threat to its existence . Not so for North Korea , which must look at its array of potential opponents and realize that their wealth and the march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . <p> In the best situation , a North Korea that continues its nuclear program ( modified or slowed down in order to continue cashing in on Western recognition and/or foreign aid ) still collapses and unifies with the South during the next few years . This assumes that the North Korean domestic situation is as parlous as the few visitors and diplomats who have gone to Pyongyang report . The nuclear program 's legacy , including a few bombs , falls into the hands of the South Koreans , who not so long ago had their own very active nuclear program . Would the South Koreans , now inheriting a unified country , with all the financial and social burdens that would entail , discard the nuclear weapons they inherited ? Perhaps  --  in return for , let us say , vast amounts of financial aid from Japan and the United States . But perhaps not . The psychological consequences of the unification of a long-divided country are a difficult matter to predict , and it is at least as likely that such unification would lead to assertive nationalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are claimed by at least one very large neighbor . <p> In a much milder way German unification seemed to breed a slightly more assertive foreign policy ( in , for example , Yugoslavia and vis-a-vis Eastern Europe as a whole ) . A better analogy might be the consequences of German , Italian , and American unification in the mid nineteenth century , all of which bred various forms of national assertiveness that bear remembering . And a unified Korea might plausibly think that nuclear weapons would serve it well as a means of counterbalancing pressure from China , which might look askance at the emergence of a united and economically vigorous Korea on its borders . Spreading Re-armament <p> WHAT difference would a unified Korea , armed with a handful of nuclear weapons but ruled pretty much as the South is today , make for the rest of the region ? Probably the reaction in Japan would be pressure , at the very least , for an active nuclear-weapons program of its own . This pressure would result partly from cultural rejection of the idea of a Korea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Korea has already begun spending increasing sums of money on naval forces , a matter of some long-term concern to Japan . A Korea embroiled in unification might not be the most comfortable of neighbors , and the entire process might look like evidence of American ineptitude in handling the security of Northeast Asia . <p> It is now known that in the late 1960s , when the treaty to control nuclear proliferation was being drafted , Japanese diplomats thought it important for their country to reserve the right to acquire nuclear weapons . With its large civilian nuclear program and its technological sophistication , Japan could easily acquire a nuclear arsenal of several hundred warheads in short order . The nuclearization of Japan , in turn , could have profound consequences . It would greatly increase the anxiety already felt by other Asian countries , who have long feared Japan , and it would decrease their already shaky faith in America 's ability to manage Asian security . From there the consequences become unpredictable , particularly if Japan no longer believes that it must rely on the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can happen . What are some of the less happy outcomes ? One might simply be war . Assume that North Korea has a modest stock of nuclear weapons but that it is indeed in a state of terminal economic decline , both relatively and absolutely . In such circumstances one can imagine the North launching a war , not so much with a view to reuniting the Korean peninsula ( although such mad overconfidence can not be ruled out ) , but for more limited purposes . North Korea might wish to set the South back and secure long-term gains ( recognition , foreign aid ) in return for withdrawing from , say , the Seoul area . Nuclear weapons on intermediate-range missiles would serve neither to deter the United States nor to attack South Korea , but they would certainly be useful in deterring Japan from allowing American forces to use bases on the Japanese home islands or on Okinawa . This could put a considerable crimp in American logistics and air power . <p> Here again , the long-term consequences bear reflection . The successful use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventional response to a local war would have disastrous consequences for nuclear proliferation in general . Again , after such an experience one would expect the Japanese to wish to pursue a more self-reliant defense policy , including large-scale ballistic-missile defenses and , quite likely , nuclearization . And having seen for themselves the utility of nuclear weapons in conflict , the North Koreans are unlikely to turn around and give them up . Blackmail , or Sale ? <p> SUPPOSE , however , that the North Koreans do not use their nuclear weapons in a war , but rather keep them as a means of ensuring modest financial support from their neighbors . A different kind of danger will come from the temptation they will surely feel to sell the weapons . There have been half a dozen recent episodes of Russian plutonium coming up for sale in Germany . For a number of countries  --  Iraq , Iran , Libya , and perhaps Saudi Arabia or an Algeria that has fallen to fundamentalist rule  --  the purchase of nuclear weapons may look like a good alternative to construction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay large sums of money for such weapons . The North Koreans might refrain from selling weapons on prudential grounds , but surely not out of a concern for the susceptibilities of the international community . The likelihood of such sales hinges , therefore , on the ability of the United States to detect them . <p> Nuclear weapons can be extremely difficult to detect by remote observation if reasonable , and not terribly expensive , precautions ( shielding and the like ) are taken to prevent discovery . Detecting the weapons would be hopeless if the Chinese were willing to allow transportation through their territory  --  a highly unlikely route but one that is conceivable , given Chinese antipathy to American counter-proliferation policies and given the corruption rampant in Chinese government circles . If such shipments went by water , the United States would have to be willing to intercept North Korean or other ships on the high seas and accept the probability that nine times out of ten such interceptions would yield nothing but embarrassment . And even so , a couple of nuclear weapons might find their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implications for Middle Eastern politics . <p> There is , of course , the possibility that the North Korean regime will neither collapse , nor use its nuclear arsenal in a war , nor sell part of it off , but merely use its weapons to help ward off its own demise . In this , the most benign of the adverse outcomes one can reasonably expect , the consequences are still worrying . The possibility of Japanese re-armament , though much reduced , remains . Beyond this , one must consider the long-term consequences of the U.S. failure to achieve a major foreign-policy objective and the clear demonstration that a signatory to the non proliferation treaty can acquire nuclear weapons and brandish them without suffering consequences . Already , many states have concluded that the way to stymie American hegemony is not by acquiring conventional military hardware  --  an area in which they can not compete  --  but by building up arsenals of unconventional weapons . Nuclear proliferation would thus have received a substantial boost , and American credibility another blow . <p> What , then , is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive themselves ( and if possible , not to deceive their citizens ) about the policy conundrums they face . In this case , it means acknowledging the possibility that there is not likely to be a good outcome in Korea . The wisest course will probably be the third choice , the quiet squeeze , which neither bribes the North Koreans nor menaces them with an immediate war ; the most likely course is the fourth , an attempt to pay Pyongyang off . Gulf War Euphoria <p> THE Gulf War went so amazingly well that most Americans  --  particularly those who do not have close relatives serving in the Second Infantry Division  --  are more willing to contemplate the use of force than ever before . It is conceivable that a second Korean War would be as much of a walkover as the Gulf War was , but highly unlikely . A victory over North Korea that left Seoul devastated ( and it would be hard to avoid this ) , South Koreans furious , the Japanese dismayed , China mortally suspicious , and several thousand Americans killed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , as is entirely possible , the South Koreans claim North Korea 's nuclear program as one of the spoils of war . <p> The objective of American foreign policy should be to make sure that North Korea gets no benefit  --  financial , diplomatic , or psychological  --  from its nuclear program and that whatever weapons it acquires remain on the Korean peninsula . The United States should make it clear that nuclear blackmail will gain North Korea nothing . That means , inter alia , a reaffirmation of our own willingness to use nuclear weapons and to continue their testing and development  --  a matter on which the Clinton Administration has been deeply divided , with the nuclear doves winning most of the internal arguments . It means quietly doing those things which can hasten the eventual fall of the regime , including maintaining its economic isolation and undermining it with propaganda . But even such a prudent course will require a steady hand , a tolerance of risk , and , what is rarest of all , a willingness to face the unpalatable fact that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COHEN <p> <p> Mr. Cohen , an NR contributing editor , is a professor of strategic studies at the Paul H.
