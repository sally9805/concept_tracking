<p> On July 2 , 1993 , Mack McLarty and Leon Panetta held a long-awaited press conference to announce the results of their investigation into the White House Travel Office scandal . They singled out four staffers for particular criticism : David Watkins , the White House administration chief who fired the travel office staffers ; William Kennedy , the associate White House Counsel who brought the FBI in to investigate ; Jeff Eller , the director of media affairs who was in on the planning ; and Eller 's girlfriend Catherine Cornelius , the low-level aide whose designs on the office helped start the whole affair . <p> " We 've had some very frank and direct discussions and I have made it clear that I will not tolerate any repetition of the conduct which has been criticized , " McLarty , then White House chief of staff , said . " I have issued reprimands to David Watkins , William Kennedy , Jeff Eller , and Catherine Cornelius . " Panetta , at that time OMB director , said he and McLarty told them that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been made . " Panetta later told a House subcommittee that " the reprimands were given orally by Mr. McLarty and me , " referring to the job as " dirty work . " <p> But there 's a problem with the story : it did n't happen . Three staffers who were " reprimanded " told General Accounting Office investigators that they never got the much-ballyhooed dressing-down from McLarty and Panetta . Eller told the GAO that nobody talked to him : " Mr. Eller 's reprimand , " according to a GAO investigator 's notes , " consisted of Mr. McLarty 's announcement of it at the July 2 press conference . " Cornelius told investigators that she " found out about the reprimand from watching the press conference . " As for Kennedy , the GAO papers say , " Mr. Kennedy 's reprimand regarding the travel office consisted of Mack McLarty 's oral reprimand during his July 2 press conference and no further action . " The fourth staffer , Watkins , did n't say how he learned about the " reprimand . " <p> It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Panetta 's case , to Congress . Yet the General Accounting Office 's final report on Travelgate does n't even mention the contradictions between the McLarty/Panetta line and what the White House staffers told the GAO 's own investigators . It is just one of many omissions in a report that was supposed to uncover definitive answers about Travelgate . <p> The General Accounting Office is Congress 's investigatory agency . After the administration 's conflicting public statements in the first days of Travelgate , followed by the unconvincing White House Management Review of the affair , Republicans in Congress called for hearings on the travel office firings . Democrats blocked that move and instead proposed ordering the GAO to investigate . Republicans agreed , but only with the stipulation that they would renew their call for hearings should the GAO report prove as weak as earlier efforts . The study was commissioned by Public Law 103-50 , passed in September 1993 . <p> The resulting report , published in May of this year , was mildly critical of the administration , but was mostly made up of chapters with titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report a " whitewash " and questioned the reliability of the GAO . Republicans on Capitol Hill suspected the agency probably found out quite a bit about Travelgate but  --  out of either partisanship , institutional timidity , or both  --  pulled its punches . So Republican members of the House Government Operations Committee asked to examine the notes and work papers used by GAO investigators to prepare the report . By comparing the report 's conclusions with what the investigators actually learned in face-to-face interviews of White House officials , they have pieced together a picture of omissions , misrepresentations , and mistakes that make the GAO report the latest cover-up of Travelgate . <p> The GAO papers have not been released to the public ; what follows is based on the House investigators ' analysis . It reveals a number of problems with the GAO report : The Handling of Evidence <p> Early accounts of Travelgate described how Catherine Cornelius collected and copied travel office records to build the case for the firings . Concerned that her behavior might have compromised evidence in the case , members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled . But the GAO report does not address the subject  --  even though its investigators discovered new and damaging information . <p> The White House Management Review reported that Cornelius removed a " small " number of papers from the office in April  --  and then took them home . What happened to them after that ? The Review did n't say . The GAO work papers reveal more of the story . Cornelius told GAO investigators that she took home " a stack of canceled checks " and files for a trip taken during the Bush administration . She said she kept them at home until May 12 , when deputy White House counsel Vincent Foster told her to bring them back . On the thirteenth , according to the White House Management Review , Cornelius met with FBI agents , who apparently reviewed her material and concluded that there was enough evidence to warrant an investigation of the travel office . <p> What happened next ? Normal procedure in such a case would be for the FBI to seize everything that might be evidence . But the agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foster 's request that they wait until accountants brought in by the White House to audit the travel office finished their work ( the audit took just three days , ending on May 17 , 1993 ) . The agents not only waited until after the audit was finished ; they waited nearly a month more , finally getting the records on June 10 . <p> Where was the evidence kept before June 10 ? GAO investigators asked a man named Brian Foucart , who at the time was the acting director of the White House Administrative Office . He told them : <p> " The bulk of the travel office records were kept in the file room and were kept locked until June 10 . There were some records in the travel office that . . . Catherine Cornelius . . . had access to before June 10 . However , I removed the checkbook , cash , journal and black notebooks on May 19 and gave them to the FBI on June 10 . " <p> What did Foucart  --  or other White House staffers  --  do with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he do with the checkbook , cash , journal , and black notebooks ? The answers could be critical to the case of fired travel office head Billy Dale , who is facing possible indictment on charges he embezzled $55,000 from the fund used to pay for press trips . The Washington Times , citing associates of Dale , has reported that he kept records of his spending in black notebooks , and that those notebooks , which could exonerate Dale , are now missing . But the GAO apparently did n't ask . <p> It did ask whether any travel office documents were in Vince Foster 's office at the time of his death . Investigators spoke to former White House counsel Bernard Nussbaum , who was among those who removed materials from Foster 's office after Foster apparently shot himself . The investigator 's notes say Nussbaum replied : <p> Mr. Foster 's office contained confidential and privileged information . It also contained materials regarding the travel office which Mr. Nussbaum did not describe . <p> What were they ? The investigator apparently did not ask any follow-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It turns out that even when the White House gave them to the FBI , it did n't actually give them to the FBI . According to the GAO 's interview of Joseph Gangloff , the acting chief of the FBI 's Public Integrity Section , <p> The WHTO documents are being held in the White House Counsel 's Office under lock and key and . . . although the White House had physical custody , the FBI must approve access to them . <p> None of these findings are included in the GAO report . Not Cornelius taking the documents home , not the delay in giving them to the FBI , not the evidence in Foster 's office , not Foucart 's removal of critical items , not the fact that the records stayed in the White House . Nothing . The President 's Statements <p> Bill Clinton said very little in public about Travelgate . But the things he did say appear to contradict each other ; Congress wanted the GAO to clarify his role in the affair . As part of its investigation , GAO asked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the firings . <p> On May 19 , 1993 , the day of the firings , Clinton was asked whether the action was fair . His response : <p> " All I know about it is that I was told that the people who were in charge of administering in the White House found serious problems there and thought there was no alternative . I 'll have to refer to them for any other questions . That is literally all I know about it . I know nothing else about it . " <p> Six days later , in response to a similar question : <p> " I 've told you all I know about it . All I knew was there was a plan to cut the size of the office , save tax dollars , save the press money . " <p> The next day : <p> " The press complained to me repeatedly about being gouged by the White House Travel Office . I kept hearing it everywhere . " <p> In a week , Clinton had gone from knowing the barest of information told him by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's hard to reconcile the last statement with the first . In the words of one congressional investigator , " If the President told the truth in that statement , then all his other statements are lies . " <p> The GAO report does not mention any of these contradictions . Perhaps some explanation might have been obtained by interviewing the president . But the GAO did n't even ask . The Role of the First Lady <p> The actions of Hillary Rodham Clinton are one of the persistent mysteries of Travelgate . The White House Management Review lists several instances in which she either inquired about or received information on the travel office . The GAO report cites David Watkins ' statement that on May 12 Hollywood producer and White House pass holder Harry Thomason told him that he , Thomason , spoke to Mrs. Clinton about the travel office . On May 14 , according to the GAO report , Watkins told her about sloppy management in the office and the first lady " urged that action be taken to get ' our people ' into the Travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the GAO , but she did answer a small number of written questions ( her response was not actually in her own words , but instead came by way of a letter from the White House Counsel 's office ) . A footnote in the GAO report contains her response to Watkins : she " does not recall this conversation with the same level of detail as Mr. Watkins . " But the report does not include her answer to the question : Did she talk with Thomason ? The answer is in the work papers : <p> Mrs. Clinton has a general recollection of having conversations with Mr. Foster and Mr. McLarty about the Travel Office situation prior to the termination of the Travel Office employees . She has no specific recollection of any particular conversation with Mr. Thomason on this issue at that time . <p> No specific recollection , no particular conversation , at that time . It was the sort of legalistic evasion that enraged senators of both parties when used by White House officials during the Whitewater hearings . Yet the GAO , an arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor did it follow up on what it might actually mean . David Watkins 's Role in the Cover-Up <p> On February 15 , three months before the firings , Watkins received a memo from Catherine Cornelius suggesting changes in the travel office . She had coveted a job in the office since the campaign and had given Watkins two previous memos on the subject . In the February memo , she included an organization chart for a new travel office ; her own name was at the top . <p> When the storm erupted after the firings , Watkins said he did not read the February memo , that he simply received it and filed it away . When GAO investigators asked questions about the issue , they were faced with conflicting stories . Cornelius said Watkins asked for the memo , a statement which , to its credit , the GAO included in the published report . But , according to the work papers , she went further than that : Cornelius told GAO investigators of a conversation with Watkins in which " it was clear that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report simply says Watkins " told us he had little recollection of the details of the memoranda and apparently he did not respond substantively to any of them . " <p> But that was n't the whole story . According to the notes , when investigators first questioned Watkins , his response was : " Mr. Watkins does not remember reading Ms. Cornelius ' Feb. 15 memo . He did n't respond to it . He does not know why it was written . " <p> Three days later , according to the notes , Watkins 's lawyer called up to clarify his client 's answers : <p> Watkins 's attorney said that while Mr. Watkins did not actually read the memo until he saw it in the Management Review , he does recall receiving it and briefly scanning its contents , especially the organizational chart which named who would serve in which position . The lawyer said Mr. Watkins also recalls discussing the memo briefly with either Ms. Cerda or Ms. Cornelius. 1 <p> There is no mention of Watkins 's memory change in the GAO report . Nor does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explanation of why he ordered the firings in the first place . <p> Watkins originally justified the shake-up by saying it was part of Vice President Gore 's National Performance Review , a story spokeswoman Dee Dee Myers passed on to the press . The explanation was greeted with great skepticism and died altogether when the vice president 's office said it was n't true . By the time he spoke to GAO investigators , Watkins had a different story : The travel office review , he said , was actually part of the effort to fulfill the president 's pledge to cut White House staff by 25 percent . The GAO apparently did not question him on the inconsistency , nor does the report make any mention of the change . <p> Meanwhile , Watkins left the administration earlier this year after taking a presidential helicopter to a round of golf at a Maryland course . He said he was scouting the site as a possible course for Mr. Clinton to play . The Role of the Press <p> Despite Clinton 's " gouging " remark , almost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office did a good  --  and often excellent  --  job of ferrying them around the country and the world , often under difficult conditions . Yet the GAO report seems to minimize press happiness with the old White House Travel Office . The report says that " according to press representatives , services provided in making and implementing travel arrangements were satisfactory . " <p> That was a wild understatement . According to House staffers who reviewed the GAO work papers , the press representatives said far more than that : <p> Examples of the types of comments found in the GAO 's work papers include statements that the " previous staff ran an efficient operation ; " that " with Billy Dale we had a secure feeling that the baggage would be handled and there would be good hotels . . . we do not feel secure anymore ; " that " the new staff are overworked kids and we are less confident now about travel operations ; " that the press had " tremendous respect for Billy Dale . " <p> None of that praise is found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press were drawn from very few interviews . The report cites interviews with representatives of just one television network , one major newspaper , and one national magazine , out of the dozens that regularly assign reporters to the White House beat . In comparison , investigators interviewed forty-five airlines , airline brokers , and travel agencies . <p> Beyond the major points , the GAO work papers contain several previously unknown minor  --  and sometimes amusing  --  facts about Travelgate . Like the following description of one of Harry Thomason 's White House visits : <p> Thomason was asked to provide advice on " how to use the White House better as a physical plant . " Actress Markie Post and Mr. Thomason 's assistant were with him . . . <p> At the meetings , he talked to White House staff about " communication links between offices , " communications with the media , scheduling the President 's time , developing a theme or message and how to get headlines from events . <p> Mr. Thomason and Ms. Post took notes of the meetings . <p> Then there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watkins about Management 101 at the White House : <p> Mr. Watkins does not know the definition of the term procurement official . However , he does obligate funds for government goods and services . He is not aware of the Procurement Integrity Act or if he is subject to it . <p> And there is a curious episode involving Dee Dee Myers . It was widely reported that Darnell Martens , the Thomason business partner who wanted some of the White House travel business , called Myers to ask about getting in on the action . She told the press in May that " I talked to Darnell in probably early February . . . . It was about a 30-second phone conversation . I transferred him to the Travel Office . " Later in the same briefing , she said Martens had come to the White House a few days before : " Let me just point out , the reason Darnell Martens was here on Friday was because he was in Washington and I asked him to come . " Yet when GAO investigators interviewed Myers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any contacts with Mr. Martens about the travel office . " The investigator goes on to note , " This is contrary to the Management Review . " There is no mention of the inconsistency in the GAO report . <p> Republicans in Congress are quick to point out that their objections to the GAO report are not aimed at the GAO investigators . Those who have read all the work papers say the investigators did a pretty good job ; they got a lot of information and passed it on to their superiors . But that is where the whole thing broke down . <p> The report was written by Nancy Kingsbury , an assistant director of the GAO . In " The Travelgate Cover-Up , " published in these pages last June , David Brock , citing Republican staffers in the House , reported that Kingsbury " betrayed a bias " on the issue , saying that the fired travel office employees are better off now than they were at the White House . The staffers also told Brock that the GAO seemed to have reached its conclusions before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they said , were written before key White House witnesses were interviewed . And , of course , the GAO did n't interview the fired travel office workers themselves . <p> When questioned about the issues raised in this article , the GAO 's answers revealed an agency willing to restrict its own investigation  --  and accept the White House word on Travelgate : On the reprimands , GAO spokesman Cleve Corlett says " we were n't doing an investigation of reprimands . " On the handling of evidence , Corlett says the GAO has " no direct knowledge " of what Brian Foucart did with the checkbook , cash , journal , and black notebooks , but assumes he needed access to them , since he was responsible for helping run the travel office after the firings . On the Travelgate papers in Vince Foster 's office , Corlett says GAO investigators who interviewed Bernard Nussbaum agreed among themselves that when Nussbaum mentioned " materials regarding the travel office " in Foster 's office , he was referring to a single , well-known document concerning a complaint about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The work papers do contain a note to that effect  --  but it was n't written by GAO investigators . It was added to the papers by Nancy Kingsbury , and signed " NKingsbury , 5/12/94 , " which was long after the investigators had done their work . It was , in fact , after the GAO report was published . Kingsbury 's handwritten note was added about the time members of Congress asked the GAO to open its records . On the role of the president , Corlett says the GAO did not attempt to question Clinton because top White House officials had already taken responsibility for the firings and the GAO had no reason to question the White House Management Review . On the first lady 's role , the GAO sees no problem with Mrs. Clinton 's statement that she has " no specific recollection of any particular conversation with Mr. Thomason on this issue at that time . " Corlett says the first lady " clearly stated that she did not have any further specific recollections of conversations with Mr. Thomason . " On David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to figure out whether Watkins or Catherine Cornelius was telling the truth : " Resolution of these differences , " Corlett says , " was not relevant to the overall outcome of our work . " On the role of the press , Corlett says determining whether the press was happy with the travel office was not central to GAO 's mission of assessing " the financial management operations of the travel office and the actions of White House and other officials in the dismissals of the seven employees . " And on the failure to question the fired workers , the GAO says all seven refused to answer written inquiries . What about interviews ? " The Justice Department , " Corlett says , " objected to interviews because of an ongoing criminal investigation . " <p> All the contradictions and gaps in the GAO 's report and work papers have prompted Republicans in Congress to resurrect the call for hearings . They point out that the study was conducted by order of Congress ; lying to the GAO , they contend , is the same as lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears the official lied to Congress directly . It will take hearings , they insist , to sort it all out . <p> That all depends on the elections ; if Republicans win control of either house , there undoubtedly will be hearings . In an October memo , Newt Gingrich offered a one-word explanation of what he felt would be the key power of a Republican-controlled Congress : " subpoena . " Now that Congress 's own investigators have failed to get the story of Travelgate , that seems the only way to find out . <p> 1 The GAO also learned details of how Watkins came to request the memo . The work papers say that Watkins originally requested another assistant , Matt Moore , to prepare a memo on staff travel . According to the notes , one of Cornelius ' co-workers " said that Ms. Cornelius ' feelings were hurt because Mr. Moore was asked to do the memo . " The documents say Cornelius went to Watkins , apparently to complain , and he told her to prepare her own proposal on taking over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February 15 memo that Watkins first said he did n't remember . <p> PHOTO : Leon Pannetta <p> by Byron York <p> <p> Byron York is a writer and television producer in Washington <p> <p>
