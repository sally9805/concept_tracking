Saddam Hussein has always had two options : 1 ) to withdraw from Kuwait and avoid destruction of his forces or 2 ) not to surrender the invaded territory , let his country absorb allied attacks and fight a defensive ground war . Neither alternative has ever been particularly attractive to the U.S. and its allies , even before the war began . In the first case , Iraq 's military power would have been preserved ; in the second , allied casualties would be higher . <P> We now face the choice between a prolonged conflict or a partial survival of Saddam 's power . Our overwhelming force will prevail . But what will we do after we have destroyed a good portion of Iraq 's military , ravaged Iraq 's industrial infrastructure , severed fresh-water-supply systems in major cities and driven Iraqi military forces out of Kuwait ? Will we pursue the retreating Iraqis mile by mile , ultimately to impose unconditional surrender ? <P> Whether we like it or not , the U.S. is being criticized for the sustained nationwide attacks on Iraq , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . mandate for the ejection of Iraqi forces from Kuwait . Also , highly publicized evidence of damage to nonmilitary areas is arousing concern . No matter how limited or inadvertent this damage may be , the vivid pictures of destroyed homes and children 's bodies being removed from air-raid shelters are a propaganda victory for Saddam . <P> Islamic leaders , in Iran and even among our own allies , have been calling for a peace effort , which would have to include a cease-fire . During this period , an unequivocal commitment from Saddam and united pressure from the alliance , including the Soviet Union , would be necessary to assure Iraq 's total withdrawal from Kuwait . <P> We should not reject the option of a cease-fire . To foreclose this possibility and demand complete surrender as an alternative to any peace % negotiations , even after Saddam 's expressed willingness to withdraw from Kuwait is confirmed , is to ensure a long and destructive war , a fragmentation of the alliance and the likelihood of a destabilized Middle East . Complete destruction of Iraq 's army will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we insist also that Saddam face trial as a war criminal , then he is not likely to yield except as an act of finality and hopelessness , regardless of the devastation suffered by his country . <P> It is true that a cease-fire could permit some repairs and possible adjustments of Iraqi forces . These benefits could be minimized by the terms of the allied announcement of a truce , which might preclude the rebuilding of bridges or the redeployment of armored units . Pinpoint attacks by our smart bombs could stop these actions even during the respite period . <P> After more than 73,000 sorties against Iraq and its military sites , with minimal losses by the U.S. and its allies , Saddam and his top officials must now be convinced that the allies can continue this one-sided devastation indefinitely . There is little doubt that Iraq 's anticipation of victory over the allied forces has dissipated .
