IN HOSPITALS ACROSS THE U.S. , DOCTORS ignore , or are unaware of , the last wishes of dying patients , needlessly prolonging their pain and suffering . That is the disturbing conclusion of a massive study published last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association . " There is a tragic mismatch between the health care many seriously ill people want and what they get , " says the University of Virginia 's Dr. William Knaus , co-director of the study . " We do n't know when or how to stop . " <P> In the initial phase of the study , which was conducted with a $28 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation , hundreds of doctors and nurses in five major teaching hospitals cooperated in observing 4,301 desperately ill patients . Among their findings : <P> While a third of the patients had asked not to be revived with cardiopulmonary resuscitation , half the time DO NOT RESUSCITATE was never written on their charts . <P> Nearly 40% of patients spent at least 10 days in intensive care , kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to communicate in their last three days of life reported that they were in severe pain . <P> " We do n't decide to let patients die in peace until almost the last moment , " says George Washington University 's Dr. Joanne Lynn , the study 's co-director . " This is hard on patients , their families and the health professionals who care for them . " <P> Convinced that the problem was caused largely by a lack of communication , the researchers launched the second phase of the study , involving 4,804 different terminally ill patients . This time half the group received traditional hospital care , while the others were monitored by specially trained nurses who consulted with patients and their families , forced them to confront the realities of dying and kept doctors informed about their patients ' conditions and wishes . <P> " We were stunned to find that it did n't make a bit of difference , " says Knaus . " The tools that experts thought would work did n't . " The reasons , suggests Lynn , are ingrained in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that death is failure , " she says . " Patients and families have come to expect miracles in every case . No one wants to give up too soon . " <P> They may have to , if health-care reform is to succeed . The U.S. currently spends around $62 billion of its total expenditure of $884 billion on intensive care ; nearly 30% of all Medicare payments go to patients in their last year of life . What is needed to bring about change , some experts now suggest , is something more fundamental than improved communication : a hard look at a medical culture in which doctors have access to splendid life-saving technology and feel obligated both morally and legally to use it . " We have to recognize that there are alternatives to extending life hooked up to high-tech machines , " concludes Knaus . " And we have to think creatively to help patients craft the best way for them to live their last days . " <P>  --  Reported by Alice Park/New York             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
