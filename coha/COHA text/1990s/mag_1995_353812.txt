MYSTERIES OF THE OCEAN TO EXPLORE THE EARTH 'S OCEANS , going where no man has walked before , has always been a romantic theme on a par with exploring space COVER STORY , Aug. 14 . Like the space program , the quest for a better understanding of the ocean is about human ingenuity and the ability to adapt . Why not use NASA 's expertise to put a man on the floor of the ocean at its utmost depth before 2010 ? PETER ZEMELKA Cocoa Beach , Florida <P> YOUR ARTICLE ON THE EXPLORATION OF the ocean bottom correctly describes man 's continuous quest to seek out the last frontier . However , before we get to the center of this scientific plum , the deep ocean , there is a tremendous amount to do . There is so much ocean ( it covers 75% of the earth 's surface ) but so little knowledge . And the costs of acquiring that knowledge are great and often individually insurmountable . The only way to solve that quandary is by sharing opportunity , costs and benefits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in the past . That is why the recent interagency agreement that established the Arctic Science Submarine Program is truly unique and valuable . It sponsors a series of annual cruises to the Arctic Ocean under the sea ice for civilian science , exploiting the endurance and flexibility of a nuclear submarine . Each participating agency has something to gain . As budgets shrink , costs rise and the quest for knowledge continues , the only answer is to cooperate ! GEORGE B. NEWTON , Member Arctic Research Commission Arlington , Virginia <P> ONCE AGAIN THE EXQUISITE COMPLEXITY of nature 's life cycle stands on the brink of disruption , if not destruction , by man , the earth 's self-proclaimed highest life form . Perhaps our inherent inquisitiveness , greed and dominance cause us to play the role of the great equalizer in the overall scheme of things . It 's just unfortunate that all other life forms must always pay the price for " human nature . " LAWRENCE DANIELS Riverdale , New York <P> JOHN STEINBECK TOLD OF A GIANT SEA creature washed ashore in Monterey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . Folks rushed to the shore to examine the fearful monster but found a local scientist had already posted a note on it  --  " Do n't worry about it . It 's a basking shark . ' ' Nothing mysterious . Nothing to get excited about . Once again , science had drained the life and beauty out of nature . Let 's leave the deep sea alone and let it retain the one thing that seems to be increasingly rare on this shrinking planet  --  mystique . RANDY OLSON Los Angeles <P> CONQUER ! ASSAULT ! I WAS DISMAYED AT seeing these words describe the continuing exploration of the depths of the seas . I have been awed by the underwater beauty of the ocean on just one snorkeling trip , and feel privileged to have beheld it . Surely man can leave this last frontier alone ! True , there may be medicines to be found in the sea , but more people will die of starvation than by the diseases these might cure . If we are to survive , our primary focus must be worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depleted the resources of the seas ? BARBARA J.
