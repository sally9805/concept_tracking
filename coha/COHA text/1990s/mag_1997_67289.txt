VARSITY TEAMS : 21 INTRAMURAL SPORTS : 18 FAMOUS ALUMNI : KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR , JACKIE ROBINSON EXTRA CREDIT FOR : RECORD 94 NATIONAL TEAM TITLES // All things considered , UCLA should change its name to the University of California , Loaded with Athletes . Consider : The Bruins have won 94 national team titles in 19 sports , the most of any school . The 49 current or former UCLA athletes at the Atlanta Olympics took home 22 medals , and their haul of 12 golds was exceeded by only six countries . The list of alumni is even more mind-blowing than these accomplishments would lead you to believe . // UCLA can boast of the best player in the history of college basketball ( Lew Alcindor , now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ) , Softball ( Lisa Fernandez ) and volleyball ( Karch Kiraly ) . The media darling of the Atlanta Games , Kerri Strug , is now a freshman in Westwood . Bruins athletes as social crusaders ? How about Arthur Ashe ? Even after you throw in Troy Aikman , Gary Beban . Jimmy Connors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rafer Johnson , Jackie Joyner-Kersee , Eric Karros , Liz Masakayan , Corey Pavin , Sinjin Smith , Peter Vidmar , Bill Walton , Keith Wilkes and the many other All-Americas , there 's still little doubt as to who is UCLA 's top athlete ever . That would be Jackie Robinson , the 1940 NCAA long jump champion , star of the basketball team and a quicksilver starting halfback on the football team . Oh , and a pretty decent shortstop , to boot . // No wonder SPORTS ILLUSTRATED has put UCLA athletes and coaches on its cover 93 times and has bestowed four Sportsman of the Year awards on them . SI even ran a six-page paean to the song girls in the March 16 , 1981 , issue . " One lost the top of her halftime uniform while dancing in front of the band , " the article reported breathlessly , " causing every spit valve in the horn section to weld shut and two freshman percussionists to attain puberty at precisely the same moment . " Yes , UCLA is a great place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting with Pauley Pavilion , home to 35 national title-winning teams . O.K. , it 's a schlepp to get to the Rose Bowl for home football games , but it 's the Rose Bowl . Jackie Robinson Stadium is the most charming place this side of Wrigley Field to take in a baseball game . // UCLA is a first-rate place to play , too . It does n't hurt that the climate is terrific or that the 11-acre intramural field is right off Bruin Walk in the heart of campus . Intramural sports are hypercompetitive in everything from basketball to squash to inner-tube water polo . Which brings us to the school year 's most eagerly anticipated sporting event , held every spring . March Madness ? Puh-leeze . Try the intersorority beach volleyball tournament . // By the way , it 's only a 15-minute bike ride to the azure Pacific . At the university 's Aquatic Center in Marina Del Rey , students can get sea kayaks and sailboats , not to mention instruction in their use . There 's a surf club  --  and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same morning by catching some swells at sunrise and then making the 80-mile drive to Mountain High Ski Area , in the San Gabriel Mountains , in time to catch the first run of the chairlifts . // Yet for all its other sporting credentials . UCLA will forever be known as a basketball mecca  --  the school that under coach John Wooden won 10 NCAA men 's titles between 1964 and ' 75 . But the success of the varsity is only half the story . UCLA is a pickup hoops hub , and with 38 rims on campus there 's always a game somewhere . The most stirring basketball is played in the late spring and summer at Pauley , where varsity players as well as Magic , Shaq and a couple dozen other members of the sport 's royalty convene . Longtime NBA guard Doc Rivers once said some of the best teams he ever played on were in the pickup games at Pauley . Naturally , students pack the joint to watch , and sitting up there in the stands , in the shadow of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing : Now this is a jock school .
