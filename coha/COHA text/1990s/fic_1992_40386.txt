Foreman <p> SANDY SCHAFFER WAS WALTZING around the garden with the tiller when the call came to go back to work . " You 're panting , " the BA said , a smile in this voice . " Did I interrupt some steamy bedroom scene ? " <p> " You got the first part right , " Sandy replied . " Unfortunately , it 's been the garden tiller dragging me around out in the garden . " <p> " You 're probably ready to go back to the tools , then , eh ? " <p> " And get rid of my unemployment fat ? " Sandy asked , adding mock shock to her voice . " Just tell me when and where . " <p> The next morning found the sheetmetal worker back with the company for which she had last worked . She was n't thrilled to be known as the Fuzz Queen , either , but she had been called worse . There has been called worse . There had been a time when she had worried what the guys thought about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long gone . Over the past 15 years they had seen her do her share of the heavy stuff , too . <p> " Hey , d' ya wan na go out in the field ? " Jimbo , the shop foreman , asked . <p> " You mean I really get to do some sheetmetal work ? " she asked kiddingly . <p> " I do n't know , " Jimbo replied , grinning . " Dan needs a hand at Maple Grove Nursing Home . " <p> Sandy finished out the day and reported to the nursing home the next morning . <p> Dan was happy to see her . He and a cub apprentice named Tim showed her around the job . It was a one-story nightmare-wood construction exterior , metal stud interior . <p> " This will be lots of fun , " Dan said sarcastically , pointing to the basement trusses , some of which were on ten-inch centers , as if they would need to support a herd of elephants . " We 're supposed to get 16x14-inch duckwork up there . " <p> Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " I 've looked at the plumber 's prints , and , naturally , his are real nice , but look at this thing ! " <p> " This thing " was a poorly drawn and copies roof line plan with the strangest scale of feet Sandy had even seen . The ductwork was drawn in as straight lines only , making it look exactly like the roof lines , wall , plumbing pipe , and sprinkler system . <p> " Good grief ! " she exclaimed . " Whatever happened to an eight-inch equals a foot ? " <p> " I do n't know , " Dan answered glumly . " I came up with 3/32 's equals a foot , but that 's not right , either . Now we just look for land-marks , like the fifth window from the north for this supply run . " He pointed with his ruler . " We have some redesigning to do , too , " he added . " Come and look at this . " He walked toward the front of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't bother to come out here and do any homework , that 's for sure . " Dan pointed to the print . " See here where the unit comes down through the roof ? That 's back behind us , above the eight-foot ceiling , which , by the way , is going to be drywall ... the dummies ! Then the ductwork comes out here where the ceiling is lord know how high . It just sticks out into this room according to the print ! " <p> " I 've always thought all the architects and engineers should have an apprenticeship , too , " Sandy said . " This stuff always looks real nice on paper . " She was beginning to feel that fuzz duct job was n't so bad . <p> After two weeks Dan informed his two compadres he had to go to another job . <p> " You 're in charge , " he told Sandy , slapping her on the back . " Have fun ! " <p> " Thanks a lot , " Sandy replied morosely . <p> " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you run into any obstacles , call Jimbo and he can find me on my master blaster . Say , why do n't you redo the ductwork on Unit Seven and call it in ? That way they can be making it so you do n't run out of things to do . And then he was gone . <p> The first step was to look at the size of the duct that was supposed to come off the supply side of the unit , then add up the airflow coming out of all the registers to see if the total cubic feet of air per minute added up . Amazingly , it did . Sandy got a ladder and climbed up to measure the truss spaces . These were on 24-inch centers , but when she looked down the line , the trusses changed direction and height . <p> She stepped off the ladder and examined the print again , one of several hundred times , it seemed to her , that she would do so . The print also specified 14-inch round supplies out in the entry room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enough to accommodate those measurements , too , and still have enough air flowing through it . <p> Then there was the return air , and again , the print was no help . Nothing was where the print said it would be . They should have sent me a blank piece of paper with the word " Guess " written on it , she thought acidly . <p> Later that day Randy , the plumber , told her that Billy , the boss carpenter , had told him the tinners had left some garbage that needed to be hauled away . <p> " Why did n't he tell me ? " Sandy asked . <p> Randy shrugged and grinned . " Maybe he thinks you 're a castrating bitch ! " <p> " Well , I guess he needs to learn , eh ? " Sandy said dryly . She marched out to the trailer and cornered him . <p> " Listen , Billy , " she said . " I 'm not going to run to the porta-potty and dissolve into tears if you have something to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What on earth are you talking about ? " <p> " If our trash needs to be hauled away or some ductwork needs to be changed - whatever - it 's not really the plumber 's concern , is it ? " <p> Billy remained silent for several long seconds . " You know what , " he said , " I 'm sorry . It never dawned on me that I had done that . " He started to laugh . " I 'm not laughing at you , " he explained , trying to catch his breath . " I just ca n't imagine you dissolving into tears . I ca n't do it . " <p> That was good , he did n't have to know that she cried while watching Old Yeller . Let him think instead that she ate nails for breakfast ; it was good for her reputation . <p> As the job went on , she found that the cub was not Mr. Reliable . Arriving late was his specialty , always with some elaborate excuse . He left early for lunch and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She found him staring out the window several times . <p> " Hey , Tim ! " she yelled after one such incident . " You do n't want me to get the whip out , do you ? " <p> That brightened him a little . " Black spike heels and chains , too ? " he asked . <p> One day Sandy found him staring out the window again , " Tim , are you all right ? " she asked . " Every time I see you , you are n't working . If you have problems at home , or with me , or whatever , spit it out now . " <p> " I ca n't imagine doing this shit for the rest of my life , " he said for lornly . <p> " Shoulda had rich parents , " the journeywoman replied . <p> " No kidding , " he agreed . " There 's never enough money , and my wife just had a baby . It never ends , does it ? " <p> " No , it never does , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't turn your time in if you are n't here . I can let it slide a little , but when it 's two or three times every week , I have to start worrying about covering my own ass . " <p> " I hurt all the time , too , " he continued . <p> " Most construction workers I know hurt , " Sandy answered , thinking of all her friends with bad backs and screwed up knees . " And they 're a lot older than you . " Tim was 24 . <p> The apprentice 's work habits did n't improve . Sandy decided to call Dan one evening since he was on the apprenticeship committee . " I thought it was just me , " Dan said after Sandy explained why she had called him at home . <p> " I do think somebody needs to talk to him since he 's real close to getting his card , " Sandy replied . " I 've given him some advice , but I do n't know how much he 'd take coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know everything . " <p> " I guess I 'll call the BA and have him talk to him , " he said . " Maybe that will straighten the kid out . " <p> " This whole business gives me a gut ache , " Sandy admitted . " I do n't want to say the kid 's goofing off . In the meantime , I 've got a bunch of hungry carpenters right on my tail . Could I call the shop and get some help ? " <p> The next day both Tim and Al showed up to help install fart fan pipe in the 52 resident rooms . <p> She had already had a neckful of the fart fans : First the sheetmetal contractor was supposed to provide and install them . Then the owner of the building changed his mind and wanted fart fans with lights in them , which made the fans the responsibility of the electrical contractor . <p> The electrician told Sandy the fans had three-inch outlets . Since they had already run four-inch pipe out to the soffits , she ordered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Lou to find out what kind of flex duct to order because it was n't specified on the print . Lou was out playing golf , but Jimbo said to use plastic dryer went . <p> " You gon na have those fans hooked up today ? " High Time , the sheetrocker boss , wanted to know . " We 're supposed to put the lid up starting Monday . " <p> " Not to worry , dear , " she told him sweetly , watching him blush . While he had the biggest mouth this side of the Mississippi , he really was sort of meek with her . <p> " Guess what , Sandy ? " Al interrupted , " the outlets on those fans are n't three-inch , they 're four . " <p> " Oh , you 're kidding me . " Sandy explained , stomping over to his ladder . She could see from the floor that it was true . " I 've got the company truck , " Al said , " Shall I go exchange this pipe ? " Sandy nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When Al returned with the correct size pipe , the trio began hooking up fans . Sandy was on her second one when she felt an excruciating pain in her right ankle . Biting back tears , she got up and limped over to a window seat . <p> " Let me see it , " Tim commanded . The ankle had started swelling and there was an angry purple mark forming right below the bone . " You really ought a go home and put ice on that , you know , " Tim said . <p> " I think I 'll sit here a few minutes and see how it feels , " Sandy replied , setting her foot on the floor and wincing . It was extremely tender , but there was a wing full of fart fans to do . She was never so glad to see 3:30 in her life . Her ankle throbbed , it was hot and she felt miserable . <p> The weekend was too short , as usual , but her ankle felt a little better . She was working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple rooms away . <p> " Whadd'ya mean , we ca n't put the ceiling up ? You want us to go downstairs and start ? We 'll have to take that stuff down again ! You people could n't coordinate a tree-house ! " <p> Turning , Sandy almost ran headlong into Billy . " Why do n't you watch what you 're doing ? " he spat . <p> " Why do n't you know what you 're doing ? " she asked , her own dander rising . " What do you mean , they are n't hanging any more of the ceiling ? I twisted my ankle here Friday , but I stayed anyway , because High Time needed those fans hooked up ! And now you tell them to go downstairs . We do n't have any ductwork installed down there yet ! " <p> " There 's some shit about the fire code , " Billy said . <p> " The only fire code this place needs is a can of gasoline and a match ! " Sandy yelled . Out of the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbed the print and her clipboard and yelled for Tim to follow her down to the catacombs . <p> The only good thing about the basement was that it was maybe five degrees cooler than the upstairs . While they were hunched over the print , the city inspector walked in . " I 've got good news and I 've got bad news , " he said . " The good news is this place is a dump , and the bad news is your fart fan flex is n't right . It 's got to be aluminum flex . " <p> " That 's what I get for listening to Jimbo ! While you 're here , why do n't you clue us in as to what kind of scale to feet this is . I 've never seen anything like this . " <p> The inspector laughed . " This scale comes from a little electronic gizmo that you can buy for about $150 that would break out here on the job in probably five minutes . Is that what they gave you to work with ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ None of the electric has been approved yet - you ca n't have a ceiling print showing where everything goes if it has n't been approved yet , can you ? " Sandy said . <p> The aluminum flex arrived the next day . it was like tin foil and screws would n't hold it on the existing pipe , so they did what tinners do and stuck it on with miles of tape . <p> Things went better than they expected until the truckdriver showed up . <p> " We did n't order anything , did we ? " Sandy asked . <p> " Well , you got a bunch of fart fans out there , " the truck driver said . <p> " What the hell 's going on ? " Sandy asked . <p> " All I was told was to bring these out here , " the driver said apologetically . <p> " You know what , " Sandy aid , " I bet they got changed again ! I bet the owner decided the fans with lights were too expensive , so he went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " <p> She looked into the truckbed . Some different sized boxes caught her eye : three-inch aluminum flex . " You might as well take this back , " she told the truck driver . " The fans have four-inch outlets . " <p> Tim spoke up . " Let 's check , shall we ? With our luck , we do need this instead of the four-inch . " He tore open a box . These fans were three-inches . Sandy was glad she had n't sent the reducers back . " Do you think that possibly the third time around we 'll be charmed ? " <p> They were almost done reinstalling the fart fans in the west wing when Randy ran into the room out of breath . <p> " Did you know there 's supposed to be a laundry chute going down to the basement ? " he asked . <p> " A laundry chute - here , look ! " Randy showed her his print . Wordlessly , Sandy went in search of Billy to wring his neck . <p> " Hey , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement ? " she asked when she found him . " Not only a laundry chute , but a huge laundry chute - four by four down there where the trusses are n't even on one-foot centers ! And it 's not on my print ! I do n't know what size it really is , what it 's supposed to be made of , if it 's going to be in the wall or just a big gaping hole in the floor ! " She stormed out of the building and called Lou . <p> Her boss calmly told her he 'd look into all her questions , and , quite frankly , he 'd gotten a bellyful of the job , too , because the owner had no idea what he wanted or what it took to get what he wanted . <p> " You have no idea how frustrating it is , " she informed him . " Put stuff up , take it down , find out there 's supposed to be a laundry chute , which is , by the way , right were we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Well , do n't take it down , " Lou said . <p> " Oh , do n't worry , " Sandy replied , " I told Billy it would take an Act of Congress . " <p> " There 's supposed to be a meeting out there tomorrow , " he told her . " I 'll see if I can squeeze some answers out of them , but do n't hold your breath . Oh , by the way , you need to send Al in after today , too . " <p> Sandy went back to work . She had just finished the second to the last supply run and was tossing tools and tape down to Tim when the general contractor stepped into the room . " Did n't Lou tell you this has all changed ? " he asked her . " We 're adding soffits all around the room - the ductwork is supposed to be concealed in that ! " <p> " No , I did n't know this was all changed , " Sandy said , mimicking him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who backed away slightly . " Tell me something , " she asked calmly . " You 've been here almost every day for the last two weeks . You 've seen us working on this nightmare . Why is today the first time it dawned on you to speak up about this change in plans ? " <p> " Your boss should have told you , " he said adamantly . <p> " My boss did n't utter a peep , " she replied just as adamantly . " In fact , I just talked to him this morning . " <p> As if on cue , Dan walked in . When Sandy had filled him in on current events , he went to the trailer to call Lou . Lou had no idea there were any changes , which surprised absolutely no one . He told them to leave it and he would straighten it out at the meeting . <p> She did get a much needed laugh the next day when she measured wrong for a large return air box and had to take it down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , witnessed by nearly everyone on the job . <p> Randy teased her unmercifully , " Did n't I just see you put that up ? " he quipped . <p> " Actually , " Sandy retorted , " It feels good to be fixing something that I screwed up for a change ! This has been my first mistake all year ! " <p> " And if you believe that , " Randy added , " then I have some real estate you may be interested in ! " <p> " But you did n't let me finish , " the woman responded . " I was going to say my first mistake all year , starting today ! And , I know , none of you men ever mess anything up , right ? " <p> " Well , naturally , " the plumber agreed good-naturedly . " Really , though , the first thing I do if I 've messed something up is look around to see if anybody saw me do it . Then I act real innocent and whistle while I 'm fixing it ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sandy said , smiling . It was a tremendously good thing that most of the guys were like Randy . She did n't think she could have done it had they all been macho men . <p> The sweat-filled days of summer had almost passed when they had gotten as far as they could . There were still furnaces to install in the basement , and lord know how many alleged changes to engineer . <p> It always made her a little blue to be winding up a job and this one was no exception , in spite of everything that had gone wrong . She had seen some of her old friends there and met new ones . She had learned a lot on this job , too , the primary thing being that somehow the work will be completed . And there was always the sobering realization that , in spite of all she 'd learned , there were many things she still did n't know . Smiling to herself , she started rolling up an extension cord . <p> " You leaving us , m'lady ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she nodded . " Yeah , but I 'll see you on the next big one , " she said . <p> " I 'll be there with bells on , " he replied slyly . " Dear .
