<p> In the borderland battle of the bus lines , Omar Rendon is the quarry . At 2:30 A.M. on a recent Saturday , he sat on a stoop at a border station here in the Rio Grande Valley , his Igloo cooler by his side as he stoically recounted his nearly weekly migration . <p> Most Friday nights , Mr. Rendon , who installs insulation at chemical plants in Houston , makes the 9- or 10-hour overnight bus trip to Mexico to see his wife and children in Monterrey , and most Sunday nights returns north . " We want to avoid the drugs and the crime " in the United States , he explained , as the customs inspector taped seals across the luggage compartments of the Adame Tours bus he was about to reboard . " I brought them up to live with me a few years ago , but the neighbors were n't even friendly . We did n't feel safe enough to go for a walk at night . My wife did n't like it at all . " <p> So many others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico that the demand for bus seats across the border has reached an estimated four million annually , growing by about 20 percent a year . No American bus line , though , has permission to cross the Texas border and offer direct service to the Mexican interior . The North American Free Trade Agreement ostensibly opened the border to bus traffic last year , but a diplomatic snarl has officially kept it closed . <p> But while lawyers and diplomats haggle in distant capitals , resourceful immigrants have built bus lines like Adame . Beginning with a few battered vans about two decades ago , they persuaded American authorities to let them stay in business while they grew . Mexican officials , they say , usually let their buses pass  --  in return for payments that have become as much a cost of business as gasoline or tires . <p> Greyhound Lines Inc. , now the only coast-to-coast bus system , has thus had to stand by as far smaller competitors came to dominate a promising market . Greyhound , too large and visible to get away with making the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find other solutions , has been left begging for a deal with Mexico  --  or at least tougher enforcement of the laws on both sides of the border . <p> Having only recently halted a loss of passengers , Greyhound considers a bid for the Hispanic travel market in general  --  and cross-border traffic in particular  --  so crucial that its chief executive , Craig R. Lentzsch , led his board on a tour of Houston 's Hispanic bus stations on Dec. 8 . Greyhound is also in partnership talks with the owners of Turismos Rapidos , one of the largest American bus lines serving Hispanic people . In frank imitation , Greyhound is even setting up a Spanish-speaking version of itself , called S.I.T.A. Inc . <p> A lot is at stake . Frequent , low-cost transportation , often on buses more comfortable than Greyhound 's , allows more Mexicans to live and work on opposite sides of the border . <p> In coming to the United States , Mexicans have brought their bus service with them . With a population only a third as large as America 's , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than 250 million trips a year longer than 100 miles . <p> Forget the stereotypes of rattling Mexican buses with pigs and chickens snuffling and squawking in the aisles . If United States buses are largely for the poor and humble , Mexico 's plush , modern buses have become the prime means of long-distance travel . " The Mexican system is moving north , " said Earl Shorris , author of " Latinos : A Biography of the People " ( W. W. Norton , 1992 ) . " We 're importing Mexican cultural values . " <p> The Tex-Mex bus lines are so significant for the Hispanic community that the Commerce Department has given Houston a $75,000 grant to study their potential for furthering economic development . <p> Houston 's old Magnolia neighborhood , a barrio east of downtown , has become the Mexican gateway not only for Texas but also for all the Eastern and Central United States . Hispanic bus and van lines feed passengers from as far away as Chicago , Miami and New York to destinations as distant as Mexico City and Oaxaca , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taco stands along Harrisburg Boulevard are giving way to bus stations , with three of the largest on the corners opposite the Houston Metro bus station . With more than 100 daily departures , the Hispanic bus lines handle more than half as much traffic as the Greyhound station downtown . <p> Friday nights are busiest . By 7 P.M. , the crowds at Adame spill out of the cramped waiting room onto wooden benches outside . A ticket to Monterrey costs only $38 , or $60 round trip , for a journey longer than that from Boston to Washington . <p> At the counter , ticket agents and company officials jostle and untangle the cords to four constantly ringing phones . They tell callers that three , maybe four buses will leave at 8:30 or later , but everyone knows that the first bus usually pulls out closer to 7:30 . <p> Most passengers on a recent Friday were men . Though Mr. Rendon 's brother , Beto , goes home as often as he does , most go down about five or six times a year and stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  47 passengers , mostly members of a weary but upbeat emerging middle class . With curtained windows and cushioned reserved seats that tilted far back , the nearly new Dina Marcopolo G1000 bus had Mexican films on video monitors every few rows until nearly midnight , then Mexican and Tejano music the rest of the way . There had been coffee and pastries back at the terminal , and on board was a cooler of free soft drinks . <p> More than half the passengers own cars , Adame 's managers say . But only on the bus can travelers get enough sleep to allow a weekend visit . Snapping his flip phone shut after saying goodbye to his wife , Rodrigo Gonzalez , who operates construction machinery , said he visits his parents in Monterrey by himself a few times a year . " The bus is very comfortable , and it costs me less than gas , " he said . <p> When Mr. Lentzsch looked around Harrisburg Boulevard a few hours before the board was expected , he learned more than he had anticipated . Spotting an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at Autobuses Monterrey across the street from Adame , Mr. Lentzsch strode onto the cracked , weed-grown lot for a closer look . <p> Soon , Walter Price , the operations manager , came over to explain that Autobuses Monterrey had bought four used Greyhound buses . But even with permits to operate in Mexico , which two of the buses already had , crossing the border still required cash . " Mordida , " he said , rubbing the fingertips on his right hand together . An Autobuses Monterrey executive said that $50 usually went to Mexican immigration officers , $50 for customs , and $20 more at a second customs checkpoint down the road . <p> " I 've been trying to get those prices for a long time , " Mr. Lentzsch said as he walked away . " But what am I going to do ? Hand my drivers 100 bucks in cash ? " <p> He grants that Greyhound would be far stronger along the border but for its own faults  --  labor strife , management turmoil , a bankruptcy filing and another near-collapse ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ) . In 1990 , after Greyhound was hit by a strike , the Houston companies began buying their first buses , however dilapidated . <p> Esteban Adame may have been the first to carry fellow immigrants back to Monterrey , beginning with a used station wagon in 1977 , then graduating to vans . This was frontier capitalism : seldom did the early van owners steer through the maze of permits and licenses they theoretically needed , Federal officials say , although Mr. Adame says he abided by the laws . <p> Mr. Adame built his van fleet to 15 , then , in 1991 , bought two 13-year-old buses . A few years later , as interest rates fell and creditors saw that the Tex-Mex bus lines were sound risks , the companies graduated to new models . In 1994 , Mr. Adame began buying new buses and now has about 30 and plans to add 20 more next year . In Mexico , he has charter and temporary authority , having formed a Mexican company , El Faisan , to help secure permanent rights . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . Several blocks from Harrisburg Boulevard , Juan Hernandez has a shack for an office , a cement porch with old van seats for a waiting room . Even for $30 to Monterrey , he has fewer and fewer takers , but stays afloat by carrying packages often filled with merchandise that Mexicans believe is best bought in the United States . <p> " How much ? " asked one Friday night customer , presenting a box with several large coffee cans and bottles of liquid detergent . <p> Mr. Hernandez counted , pondered , then struck a deal at $15 . " I wo n't keep more than $5 , " Mr. Hernandez added in an aside , noting the tips needed to get the goods across the border . <p> While Mexican and American bus companies can already drop passengers just across the border , in California Greyhound joined with a Mexican partner to begin service to the Mexican interior in January . In Texas , though , Greyhound has yet to find a partner . <p> The Hispanic bus lines ' Mexican routes are part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away as Atlanta and the Carolinas through Houston on the way to Mexico . New York is linked to the Hispanic network by La Cubana , with daily trips from Broadway and 174th Street in Manhattan to Miami , where the bus line is based , and twice weekly to Atlanta . At these destinations passengers can connect to a Tex-Mex line , El Expreso . <p> Mr. Adame , confirming the Autobuses Monterrey account of what it costs to cross the border , nodded as an aide reported higher demands before Christmas . Alfonso Euarro , the manager of bus service permits in the Monterrey region , said he had not heard of any such payments . <p> Greyhound complains that American regulators are selective in their safety enforcement , but regulators disagree . " If you 've got 2,000 vehicles out there , you 're much more likely to be subject to inspection than if you have one bus , " said Nat Jackson , the Federal Highway Administration 's chief of bus line regulation for the Southwest . He has given some bus and van lines a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that through May this year , more than 19 van lines going between Houston or Dallas and Mexico were fined a total of $33,000 . <p> Adame , fully licensed in the United States , sometimes switches to El Faisan buses at the border , but on a recent Friday night took its own bus straight through , arriving in Monterrey shortly before 5 A.M. <p> Competition ? Mr. Adame notes that Greyhound 's past efforts to set up a Hispanic unit have posed no threat . " Greyhound said , ' You are just small ants , ' " he recalled with a chuckle . <p> For even as Adame , Turismos Rapidos and the like have become assimilated in the American legal and economic system , they let their passengers continue living in two worlds . <p> Map : " Border Crossings " While bus operations run by Mexican companies have been able to navigate freely along highways linking major cities in the U.S. and Mexico , American companies have not .
