You may remember the commercials : Louise sat at her kitchen table , a mass of paper spread out before her . At her side , brow furrowed , sat husband Harry . " Having choices we do n't like is no choice at all , " she fretted . That was 1994 , and the enemy was Bill Clinton and his 1,364-page plan to fix the health-care system . Three years after the death of that plan , things have changed so much that today Clinton could run the ad to make his own point . That 's because there 's a new bogeyman : managed care . " Clinton 's bureaucrats are n't any different than managed-care-company bureaucrats , " says Republican Representative Charlie Norwood of Georgia . <P> Welcome to the next health-care debate . This time it 's not about Washington changing the system but about keeping the free market from changing it too quickly . And it 's being waged on behalf not of the 41 million without insurance but of the 70 million who have enrolled in health-maintenance organizations . Which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . The patient " bill of rights " Clinton announced two weeks ago is supported by the American Medical Association , which opposed him last time ; 91 Republicans back a bill that resembles Clinton 's . What has n't changed is that hard-liners in both parties think the issue can carry them to success in the 1998 congressional elections . Be prepared for charges that the President is trying to socialize medicine or that the G.O.P. wants to toss sick children into the snow , all of it whipped up by the lobbyists and pollsters that dove into the health-care melee the last time . <P> America rejected Bill and Hillary 's prescription for change in 1993 partly because it threatened their comfortable care in the hands of fee-for-service doctors . But since 1993 , the number of people who have been nudged into HMOs has increased 50% , to 67.5 million . And as participation rates have climbed , so have complaints , many of which sound like the horrors that would supposedly have taken place under the Clinton plan : rationing of procedures , a narrower choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of front-page stories about plans that will pay for cataract surgery in only one eye or that keep doctors from discussing expensive types of care . In a recent nationwide poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation , an independent health-care philanthropy , 55% of those in managed care said they worry that their health plan is concerned more about saving money than providing the best care . That negative feeling is n't helped by the premium increases of 5% to 10% that some patients discovered this year when they tore open their HMO enrollment packets .
