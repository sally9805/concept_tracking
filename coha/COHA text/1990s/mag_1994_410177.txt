For four years my beloved wife , Christina , got cold when we skied . Her beautiful hands got cold . Her adorable ears got cold . Her entire gorgeous body got cold . She shivered . She chattered . She railed . She went in for cocoa . It was her metabolism , we said ; she was just inherently less furnacelike than I was , we said . Women just get colder than men . It was painful to admit , hut she would always be a little colder , a little less comfortable . We were wrong . Last winter , as part of SKIING Magazine 's skiwear test , I put her in a one-piece suit . By the end of her first day in it , she had announced that she was not giving it back . In fact , all winter , as I asked , requested , cajoled , ordered , and finally begged to have that ski suit back so other women could test it , she refused . Because she was warm . She was warm at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a bitter wind at Sugarbush . And what 's more , she looked fantastic . I attribute this ( the warmth part ) 100 percent to the one-piece suit . And it teaches an important lesson : Do not accept discomfort . If you get cold , you may  --  as simply and possibly rude as it sounds  --  be dressed wrong . But what is the right way to dress ? One-piece suits for everyone ? No , certainly not . Everyone skis differently , makes different demands of their skiwear , wants to look a certain way . And no two people have the same metabolism . My wife and I were right in thinking she and I react differently to cold . What was wrong was to think that we could n't do anything to meet her cold-weather needs . We at SKIING Magazine test skiwear to make discoveries like this . Only by knowing skiwear inside and out can we help you identify the skiwear that will be most comfortable . SKIING has been conducting skiwear tests of one sort or another for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken specific outfits and passed judgment on how well they performed given their intended end use . But that was only of limited utility ; if you could not find the specific suit we tested near where you lived , or if you could not afford it , you were out of luck . So this year , we decided to test skiwear with a different goal in mind . Instead of getting the testers to say whether or not they liked a particular garment , we encouraged them to tell us what they learned about skiwear in general from each garment . That way we got information that you can apply to any skiwear  --  whether it 's the parka on sale for $99 or the $1,200 fur-trimmed suit . Something else we did differently this year was to use SKIING Magazine staff members as testers . In the course of their winter 's work , they skied in below-zero weather and in spring when the corn snow had turned to mush . They skied in bright sunshine and blinding snowstorms . All of them entered the process with preconceptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . And all of them learned that there 's more to beautiful skiwear than just good looks . Learn from them this second lesson : Approach skiwear with an open mind . If open-mindedness was the number one lesson our testers learned , there were also several other , more specific lessons that came out of the test . First among these was that there 's a distinct difference between one-piece suits and separates , in both warmth and feel . Second is that lots of little things make a big difference in how fun and functional skiwear is . Third is that extremely luxurious feeling and looking skiwear is not just for the money-laden , I'm-just-here-to-be-seen set . Our testers found that there are a number of specific characteristics that they no longer want to do without . Here 's a review of these discoveries , and an explanation of the differences they can make . GIVE ONE-PIECE A CHANCE The number one watershed change in thinking by much of the staff was that everyone now thinks one-piece suits are the ideal ski garment . Not that separates do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing them around town and lots of other uses besides skiing . But for pure skiing comfort , in a majority of conditions , nothing beats a one-piece . A few comments : " This is the first time I 've ever worn a one-piece suit , and I really liked the feel of it . It felt less bulky and cumbersome than a traditional jacket/pant combination , and I certainly felt more secure against the elements , since there was no chink in the armor running around my middle . " " This skiwear-testing experience has opened my mind to one-piece suits . After years of getting cold drafts and wet snow down my back , this is nothing short of a revelation . " One-pieces were well loved for several reasons . For some folks ( like Christina ) , the critical factor is that they 're warm . If your big problem with skiing is that you get cold , seriously consider getting a one-piece . It will make a difference . Why so much warmer than separates ? Because there are fewer openings out of which warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much cold air can really penetrate the bottom of a ski jacket , and how much warmth can get out ? " I hear you asking . Plenty . Additionally , a lot of warmth escapes around your waist via the bellows effect . Every time you move you send a puff of warm air out the bottom or neck of your jacket . In a suit the neck is the only chimney . And in a suit , the warmth produced by your legs can travel up to your torso and warm it , rather than slipping out at the waist . For other , more hardy staff members , the critical issue was not the extra warmth that a suit provides , but the sheer comfort . There is nothing so unified-feeling , so snug , so human-bodylike as a one-piece suit . Because they are warmer than separates , they can be lighter weight . A one-piece suit can feel unbelievably comfortable , like skiing in pajamas . It would be remiss of me not to note that one/piece suits tend to be somewhat inconvenient in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits properly . The suit 's belt must fit you right , so that the pants are not tight in the crotch . The top of the suit should blouse a bit above the belt , giving you room to move . Of course , separates have their advantages as well . If you ski in a one-piece suit , you 'll have to pack a winter jacket anyway when you go on vacation , for going to the store , to dinner , to apres ski bars . And separates give you much more choice in terms of layering and temperature adjustment . If it is 20 degrees in the morning , but 50 by one in the afternoon , you may want to shed your jacket after lunch . In a one-piece suit you ca n't . ( Some one-pieces zip apart , allowing the best of both worlds . ) You can also capture a great deal of warmth by wearing bib ski pants . The high back and front of a bib helps ensure that any extra warmth generated by your legs ends up at your torso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the short and the tall of it is , if you 're always fussing trying to get warmer , try a one-piece suit . Not only will your body be warmer , but your hands and toes will be warmer , too . If you do not notice a marked difference in your warmth , we 'll come rub your toes . BETTER ( INSU ) LATE THAN NEVER ( BE WARM ) The other major consideration you have before you start shopping is whether to get insulated skiwear or noninsulated skiwear . This , again , is partly a question of versatility . After all , you ca n't take the insulation out of most skiwear . So if you buy a warm , insulated jacket , it will always be a warm , insulated jacket . Especially on a warm , sunny day . Why should n't all skiers buy uninsulated jackets and just layer more if they get cold easily ? Easy : because modern insulation is warmer than modern layering clothing . The insulation in most ski jackets is far more efficient for its thickness than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's warmth you want , most insulation will give you more of it , and with less weight , than a layering system will . The very best insulations come inside skiwear , not just on their own . ( There is one exception to that : Marmot makes what the company calls a Primaloft Sweater , a very light jacket insulated with downlike Primaloft synthetic insulation . This item is designed to be worn like a sweater , under an uninsulated jacket . ) As for uninsulated skiwear , we recommend getting serious , fairly technical stuff . Such garments will provide better weather protection while you 're skiing , and they can double as spring and autumn outerwear . The more features you get , the more versatile your skiwear becomes . If the pants zip all the way up the sides , for instance , they 're not just easier to get on and off ; they 're also better for venting if you get overheated . DO N'T BE DOWN ON YOUR LUXE Lee Carlson , SKIING 'S travel editor , did n't think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for a trip to Val D'Isere was " for him . " He grew up skiing in New York and New England , where folks do n't wear soft , cushy one-piece suits ; they wear plywood , duct tape , canvas , nettles , zinc . But , as he said of this plush number , " I loved it anyway  --  it just felt so soft and supple . " Another tester commented on the same suit : " I loved the lightweight , suede feel . It was like skiing with nothing on . " The lesson here is clear : Skiwear does not have to feel the way we think it feels . Because of advances in fabric technology , skiwear can feel downright great . The secret of this suit was its fabric . It was made of a polyester microfiber fabric that felt like peached silk . ( " Peached " fabric  --  of which there is quite a bit , all of a sudden  --  is so named for its soft , fuzzy look and feel , like the skin of a peach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than traditional synthetic fibers . Fabrics made with microfibers are often unbelievably soft , but extremely wind-and water-resistant . And it 's not only the miraculously cushy fabrics and fibers that make skiwear so wearable . Garments made with tough-as-nails fabrics do n't necessarily have to feel tough and naillike . Several of us wore a Spyder suit constructed with a beefy fabric . It feels indestructible . But the pants have articulated knees for easy motion , and you can tell the jacket is cut by and for athletes , because it moves naturally , without pulling . If the garment is cut for action , it can feel like a second skin . In the ski shop , when you try on a ski outfit , test the garment to see how well it moves . Bend , stretch , twist , jump around . Touch that sleeve , try on that jacket . High-tech can feel awfully good . " But I do n't have enough money for my clothes to feel really good while I ski , " you say . Au contraire . QUALITY FOR THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you do not have to buy the most expensive skiwear to get exceptional value and real cold-weather performance . The damned attractive French suit ( the Macora from Degre 7 ) that changed Christina 's skiing life will sell for around $450 this winter . The Roffe suit ( the Ermine ) that proved " nothing short of a revelation " to SKIING 's copy editor , Helen Burns , has a suggested retail price of $480 , which includes a cozy fleece bodysuit . ( Incidentally , Helen started to feel rather possessive about " her " suit , also . ) The point is n't that you should run out and buy these exact outfits . The point is that truly excellent skiwear is merely expensive , not astronomically expensive . What about the old " You get what you pay for " adage ? Unfortunately , that 's still at least half true . You can get okay skiwear  --  a whole outfit , not just the jacket  --  for less than $450 , skiwear that will keep you warm and dry most of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra touches . And those extras cost money . GOOD IS IN THE DETAILS Skiwear seldom excels because of a single overriding or outstanding characteristic ( except , possibly , color , or a knock-out look ) . In our tests we were usually impressed by a combination of lots of little things . For that reason , it is important that when you are considering buying a jacket , or a suit or whatever , that you forget about the big picture for a moment and think about the thousand little things your ski day consists of . Do you always ski with your wallet ? Okay , fine . here will it go ? Where will your keys go ? Your hat ? Your goggles ? Your sunglasses ? Tissues ? Sunscreen ? Try to remember all the stuff you like to schlepp with you when you ski , and figure out where you will stow it . Then consider functionality . Can you work the zipper with your gloves or mittens on ? Get a pair from the glove department and try it . Over and over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it up all the way , even through that tricky transition from torso to neck ? With the collar zipped tight , is there still a gap ? Is there room for your Turtle Fur ? Is the collar lined with fleece so you do n't chafe your chin ? Is there a collar drawstring to seal out the wind ? Do you wear a hood , and if so , can you operate it with gloves on ? No one piece of skiwear answers all of everyone 's needs . Think about the most important things you expect of your jacket , pants , or suit , and then look for stuff that includes those things . It 's amazing how that will narrow your search . BE A SKIRT CHASER When I went off to be a ski bum seven years ago , I was not the techno-dweeb I am now . But I decided the jacket I was buying for skiing had to have a powder skirt . I have no idea where I came up with this idea , as I had never owned a powder-skirted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , which narrowed my search considerably . It turned out to be a brilliant decision . Powder ( or wind ) skirts make a huge difference . They prevent snow from getting down your pants , wind from getting into your jacket , and your body 's hard-earned warmth from escaping out of the bottom the jacket . If you buy separates , be sure to get a parka or jacket with a powder skirt . The best skirts have rubber grippy stuff on them so they do n't ride up . A good powder skirt makes a parka/pant combo almost as integrated as a one-piece suit . What is the drawback to a powder skirt ? Good ones are not available on inexpensive parkas . DO N'T SHORT YOURSELF Speaking of riding up and heat escaping at the waist , none of our testers was crazy about short jackets , as they ride up all the time . Even the best short jackets were a pain . If you favor short jackets , make sure you match yours with bib pants . ARE YOU TAPING THIS ? Do skiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And no . All skiers need breathable skiwear ; not all skiers need waterproof skiwear . You animals who ski in blizzards , sleet , freezing rain , and pouring rain , you need waterproof-breathable skiwear . If you do n't ski in all kinds of nasty weather , though , why spend the dough ? Any garment with a waterproof-breathable coating or laminate is less breathable than the same garment without that coating . Increasingly , skiwear now has either a waterproof-breathable coating or a laminate . Gore-Tex is a laminate ; a layer of Gore-Tex is affixed to fabric in a top-secret manner . Ultrex and Entrant are coatings , as is virtually every other waterproof-breathable on the market . The vast majority of the coatings are polyurethane , and range anywhere from good to lousy . We have found Ultrex and Entrant to be of high quality . The term waterproof-breathable is a bit of misnomer . Few garments are completely waterproof , and some do n't breathe at all . So how do you know just how waterproof or breathable a particular garment is ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading hangtags . Just because a garment is made with waterproof-breathable fabric , and the tag says it , does n't mean the garment is waterproof or breathable . These characteristics also owe a lot to how the garment is made . If the seams are n't taped , the garment is not waterproof . Water will get in at the seams and soak you if you ski in the rain or in wet snowstorms . If the pockets are n't covered with flaps , the garment is not waterproof , no matter how waterproof the fabric is : Rain will get in the pockets . Most weatherproof zippers use a double flap to keep snow , rain , and wind out . Another weatherproofing component is a hood . Love them or hate them , they have to be well-designed . If you hate hoods , you obviously need one that zips or snaps off . Hood lovers , put the hood on and tighten it up . Does the hood move with you , or do you move inside the hood ? Is there a brim to help keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and slush drain off the hood : into its storage pocket or your collar ( bad ) , or onto your shoulders and back ( good ) ? There is one pricey way to be relatively sure you 're getting a waterproof garment : buy one that uses Gore-Tex . With Gore-Tex you are paying for the " Guaranteed to Keep You Dry " promise that comes with all Gore-Tex garments . Gore has decided that if garments made out of Gore-Tex do n't keep you dry , Gore will get blamed , not the company that made the garment . So Gore has established manufacturing guidelines that , when adhered to , pretty much guarantee a waterproof garment . And the manufacturer does n't get the " Guaranteed to Keep You Dry " tags to put on the clothes if they do n't pass Gore 's stringent tests . All of this costs money , but the net result is that clothing made of Gore-Tex is usually really , really good . Breathability is an equally vague concept . There is no international standard for breathability . Over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is truly breathable , as are Ultrex and Entrant . Some of the private label products are also quite breathable , but many are not . Many of the microfiber fabrics are the most breathable of all ( but they are not as water-or wind-resistant as the coatings and laminates ) . If you follow our earlier advice , to try on different garments and jump around , or even if you just move about inside the shop , you should at least discover if the garment does n't breathe well ; you 'll feel the moisture building up . Even if you do n't ski in the rain , you may still want to buy waterproof-breathable skiwear , because it is also windproof : The new micro-fiber fabrics we described earlier are inherently wind-and water resistant , so they do n't need a coating , and that is why they are so wonderful for many skiers who do not venture out when it is truly stormy . These fabrics breathe and they protect adequately ( nay , beautifully ) for the vast majority of skiers . ZIP , ZIP HOORAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathability is only for super-techno-dweebs , backcountry skiers , and serious overheaters . If you ever break a sweat in your skiwear , you will appreciate the cooling effect of pit zips and other ventilators . Our staff ( some of whom are not techno-dweebs , strangely enough ) loved and made frequent use of the zips on the jackets we tested . " Why not forgo pit zips and other fancy vents and just open the front of your jacket ? " I hear you asking . Go ahead , but if you 're skiing with your jacket open , wind blowing directly against your entire torso can be too cooling . Pit zips allow some hot air out and some cool air in , but being under your arms , do n't allow huge gusts of wind in Again , listen to the testers : " This was the first time this winter I 've worn a garment with them and needed them , and they really did the job  --  pit zips get my hearty recommendation . " " Skiwear with lots of bells and whistles makes skiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skiwear that in the store might appear to be too warm for warmer conditions may be quite comfortable because of adequate ventilation features like pit zips . " Some jackets have chest zips , and one jacket we tried ( the Trient parka from Marmot ) had huge chest flaps that allowed mondo volumes of heat and humidity to escape . This jacket was king of the venters , and served me well while snow-shoeing . Ventilating flaps and zips are not for everybody ; some folks have so much trouble staying warm that cooling features would be ludicrous . But I would contend that far more people will appreciate them than are currently seeking them out . OPEN YOUR MIND AND SAY " AHHH ! " Try , if you are buying skiwear this year , to enter the store with as few preconceptions as possible . Then , when you try something on , picture yourself skiing in it . Close your eyes and forget how it looks for the moment . Just think about how it feels . What if the skiwear that really feels good looks just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ? Well , then you 've got some serious open-minded considering to do . Just do n't sacrifice bliss , joy , freedom , and warmth on the pyre of an arbitrarily imposed aesthetic . Skiing is supposed to be fun . And that can even extend to your choice of skiwear . <p>
