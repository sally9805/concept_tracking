WHAT 'S THAT ? CARS ZIPPING PAST TOLLBOOTHS ON the New York State Thruway without stopping ? Ordinarily such apparent lawlessness would be followed by flashing red lights in the rearview mirror . Not this time . New York is the latest state to test an electronic toll-collection system that lets motorists pay up without having to stop and fumble for cash or tokens . If adopted , the automated system promises to save time for motorists , improve safety at toll plazas , cut pollution and possibly reduce tolls . Louisiana , Oklahoma and Texas currently use automated toll collection . New York is jointly testing two technologies  --  one developed by Amtech , another by AT &T; and Mark IV Industries  --  in conjunction with New Jersey and Pennsylvania . <P> In both cases , passing cars , the time of day and toll amount are identified electronically and registered in a central computer that automatically charges a prepaid account . The systems can process up to 1,250 vehicles an hour , compared to 350 an hour for conventional tollbooths . And the machines can handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is likely to draw some flashing lights .
