A Century of Preparation // At the end of the twentieth century , Americans , their economy , and their culture seemed to dominate many parts of the globe . A basketball player who lived in Chicago , Michael Jordan , was arguably the most recognized and revered of those Americans to billions of people worldwide . In China , schoolchildren ranked him with Zhou Enlai as the two greatest figures in twentieth-century history . The children knew Zhou because he helped create their Communist Revolution . They knew Jordan because he miraculously floated through the air as both an athlete and as a pitchman for American-produced advertisements for Nike shoes , which the children avidly followed on television . His coach in Chicago , Phil Jackson , believed that Jordan " had somehow been transformed in the public mind from a great athlete to a sports deity "  --  especially when an amazed Jackson saw people kneeling before the statue of Jordan that stands in front of the United Center , home of the Chicago Bulls . // Jordan 's phenomenal athletic prowess was unquestioned . Indiana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national championships as well as his blunt style ) , told sports columnist Mike Lupica : " Michael Jordan is the best that will ever play this game . " Sociologist Harry Edwards , an African American who blisteringly attacked professional sports and the roles assigned black players , declared : " If I were charged with introducing an alien life form to the epitome of human potential , creativity , perseverance , and . spirit , I would introduce that alien life form to Michael Jordan . " // To Edwards and many others , Jordan personified not only the imaginative , individual skills that Americans dream of displaying in a society that adores graceful and successful individualism , but the all-out competitive spirit and discipline that Americans like to think drove their nation to the peak of world power . Coach Jackson phrased it directly : " Michael is a little bit of a shark . He 's competitive to the extent that he 'd like to beat you for your last cent and send you home without your clothes . " // Such skills quickly translated into money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . But Jordan was not just an athlete , he was an African-American athlete who earned $30 million a year for playing with the Bulls and twice that amount from his endorsements and personal businesses . Within his own lifetime , African-American athletes had been victimized and exploited  --  not made multimillionaires . They were also often condemned for choosing merely to dunk basketballs or catch footballs , rather than acting as role models for future doctors , lawyers , or business leaders . That Jordan became a hero for the many races in American society was thus somewhat surprising . That he could transform this role into becoming the most successful advertising figure in the world was historic . His success in good part can be traced back to his family and North Carolina background . // The North Carolina Legacy // Since its founding in 1891 , basketball has been dominated by players  --  African-American and white , male and female  --  who came from the playgrounds , YMCAs , YWCAs , and athletic clubs of America 's cities . Michael Jordan , however , did not grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on February 17 , 1963 , to parents living temporarily in Brooklyn , New York . James Jordan , a sharecropper 's son , was attending a Brooklyn training school so he could pursue his ambition of becoming a supervisor at the General Electric plant outside the small town of Wallace , North Carolina . Deloris Jordan was meanwhile moving steadily up the corporate ladder at United Carolina Bank in Wallace . // Michael grew up in a close-knit middle-class family that revolved around the children 's enthusiasms for baseball , football , track , and , to a lesser extent , basketball . He lived in a small town far removed from the violence then shaking much of the South as the nation painfully moved from enforced segregation , which had been in place since the 1890s , to enforced integration of the races . James and Deloris preached , " You just did n't judge people 's color . " And if ignorant , racist folks hurled insults , you just determined to " move on " rather than let it slow your climb up the middle-class ladder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to better jobs in the larger city of Wilmington , North Carolina . Again , they missed the worst of the civil-rights violence . Michael seldom encountered racial taunts , although he once ground a Popsicle into the hair of a girl who called him " nigger . " But Laney High School had been integrated before he arrived , and Jordan became a sports star  --  but only by his senior year . As a sophomore he was cut from the varsity basketball team . " I went to my room and I closed the door and I cried , " he later told sportswriter Bob Greene . " For a while I could n't stop . Even though there was no one else home at the time , I kept the door shut . It was important to me that no one hear me or see me . " Nor could he get dates with girls because , as he recalled , he had an odd haircut and drew laughs for his habit of playing basketball with his tongue hanging out . // Within months after being cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suddenly grew to 6 ' 3 " . He arose at sunup to push his new body through special drills . This development came too late , however , to attract attention from many top colleges . His biographer , Jim Naughton , noted that Jordan was not even rated among the three hundred leading high-school prospects at the start of his senior year . He did enter a summer basketball camp in Pittsburgh where he played well against some of the nation 's best young players and was named Most Valuable Player . His talent drew the attention of Roy Williams , an assistant to the legendary coach at the University of North Carolina , Dean Smith . ( Williams later became famous in his own right as coach at the University of Kansas . ) Michael had never cared for the state university , but his mother did  --  especially after Dean Smith visited and talked about the importance of education rather than the glories of basketball . Anyway , there were few other offers , and his sister Roslyn who graduated after only three years of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For twenty years , Dean Smith 's system had been renowned for reaching , but never winning , national championship games . Smith produced superb professional players , employed tough discipline , insisted on nightly study halls , and held the belief that unproven freshmen should devote themselves more to books than to playing time . Jordan 's defense and passing skills were weak , but his quickness and imagination on offense , as well as his fire and work ethic , forced Smith to start him alongside two All-Americans ( and later pro stars ) , James Worthy and Sam Perkins . By midseason of his freshman year ( 1981-1982 ) , North Carolina was ranked number one in the country . Jordan was a leading scorer . // At the end of his freshman season , he suddenly became a national figure . Jordan ignored a painful throat infection to lead his team to the Atlantic Coast Conference championship . Worthy , Perkins , and Jordan then took the Tar Heels through the NCAA Championship tournament until they met Georgetown and the Hoyas ' 7 ' 1 " All-American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans and a huge national television audience . // With 32 seconds to play , Georgetown led 62-61 . Dean Smith was again on the verge of missing a national championship . Smith called a time-out and told the players to get the ball to Jordan for a final shot . Smith was trusting a freshman to make the decisive points . Jordan took a pass on the right side of the floor and shot . The ball swished through the net sixteen feet away . Smith had his championship . Worthy led the scoring with 28 points , but Jordan was the hero . North Carolina 's assistant coach Eddie Fogler observed : " That kid does n't even realize it yet , but he 's part of history now . People will remember that shot 25 years from now . " // The nineteen-year-old thus became famous for grace , and success , under immense pressure . " I 've seen other great athletes , " Dean Smith later declared , " but Michael also has the intelligence , the court savvy ... he was a hero so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Jordan 's professional coach , Phil Jackson , noted that in the many last-second situations from which Michael emerged the hero , " More often than not , he 'll replay the last-second shot he took to win the 1982 NCAA championship .... he says to himself , Okay , I 've been here before . ' " // After the triumph in New Orleans , Jordan 's college career became anticlimactic , if successful . During his sophomore year , North Carolina failed to reach the NCAA finals , although sports journalists named Jordan College Player of the Year . In the summer of 1983 , he led the U.S. Pan-American team to a gold medal in Venezuela , a trip that led him to choose cultural geography as his undergraduate major . In his junior year , the Tarheels again fell short of the NCAA finals . But Jordan had become , in the words of Sports Illustrated ' s Curry Kirkpatrick , " the finest all-around amateur player in the world . " // In the spring of 1984 , Jordan announced he would delay his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prove in college . Deloris Jordan wanted her son to remain at Chapel Hill until he obtained a degree . James Jordan and , surprisingly , Dean Smith , sided with Michael . In the National Basketball Association 's draft in June 1984 , college 's best all-around player was not the first pick . Or the second . With the first choice , the lowly Houston Rockets selected Hakeem Olajuwon . ( A great center , Olajuwon led Houston to NBA championships in 1994 and 1995 , the two years Jordan temporarily retired from the game . ) Portland , with the second pick , took 7 ' 1 " Sam Bowie of Kentucky . Plagued with injuries , Bowie never became an NBA star . // Chicago , long a losing team , then selected Jordan . Bulls ' General Manager Rod Thorn bluntly declared that he wanted a center , not a guard such as Jordan . " We wish he were 7 feet , but he is n't , " Thorn griped . " There was n't a center available . What can you do ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count his blessings . Lincicome wrote sarcastically that Thorn and the Bulls " had tried to avoid Jordan " and instead " got stuck with ... maybe the greatest natural basketball talent , inch for inch , in this young decade . " Lincicome noted that Jordan was also an attractive person with a sense of humor  --  which was fortunate because he " will need a few laughs to ease the shock of moving from a winning team at North Carolina to a loser in Chicago . " // Suspicion spread that the Bulls feigned unhappiness so they would not have to pay Jordan as much as he was worth . If so , he quickly destroyed that illusion when he signed a five-year contract for $800,000 annually . Thus Jordan and the Bulls began one of the most successful and profitable journeys in modern sports . // That happy journey could hardly be anticipated , however , in 1984 . Jordan joined a deeply troubled professional league . Basketball was at a crossroads in the United States . Few people abroad seemed to care about the NBA at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or home teams in Europe for attention . Jordan and a new era of technology changed all that . // The Naismith Legacy // Most major sports have obscure beginnings , but basketball 's can be pinpointed in time and told in detail . Those are not its only unique qualities . No game became so popular and commercialized more rapidly . // James Naismith certainly did not set out to make his game ring cash registers . The Canadian-born teacher merely hoped to keep his job at Springfield College in Massachusetts after his superior , Dr. Luther Gulick , ordered him to do something to keep young men out of trouble between football and baseball seasons . The boys in the class were almost out of control ; two of the school 's instructors had flatly refused to face them . Because it was Massachusetts , any new winter game would best be played indoors . Because Springfield College was a training school for the worldwide missionary activities of the Young Men 's Christian Association ( YMCA ) , Naismith 's answer would have to deal with the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , as well as the body and especially adrenaline of each student . // Naismith first tried variations of football and lacrosse indoors , but these quickly got out of hand . Desperate , he began writing rules for a new game . There was to be no striking or running with the ball ( as in lacrosse . The ball was instead to be passed . Nine players were on each side because Naismith 's class had eighteen students . ( Five on each side became the rule in 1897 . ) The goal was placed high above the players so they would not as easily fight each other as they would around a ground-level goal . The goals , peach baskets from a nearby orchard , were placed ten feet high where they have forever remained ) , because this happened to be the height of the gymnasium 's balcony to which Naismith could most easily attach the baskets . // How new was his sport can be debated . Historians have discovered that for two thousand years the Mayas and Aztecs played a game in which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two ends of the court . The losing team 's leader was sometimes sacrificed to the gods . In Naismith 's home country , the Abnaki of eastern Canada tried to keep an air-filled ball aloft . But no evidence has been found that Naismith knew about these earlier sports . // Named by one of Naismith 's first players as Basket Ball ( it finally became one word in 1921 ) , the sport 's popularity rapidly spread . Within the first week after Naismith introduced the game , audiences collected to watch the play . The shouts attracted female teachers who quickly taught the game to young women . Within three months after basketball appeared , a women 's tournament was held . In 1893 , the first women 's intercollegiate game took place at Smith College in Massachusetts . When the Smith women learned the game , the only male allowed to watch was the college president , one of supposed sufficient dignity and age as to avoid unwholesome thoughts while watching graceful female athletes . // A Smith College star , Maude Sherman , married Naismith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband 's rules . Believing that women were " unaccustomed to exercise , and for the most part adverse to it , " the organizers tried to protect players by having nine women on each team and requiring that three stay in one of three sections into which the playing floor was divided . A two-section , six-player women 's game would not appear until 1938 . By 1896 , California women drew hundreds of female fans to games , including a match in which Stanford defeated Berkeley 2-1 each basket counted one point ) . // During the 1890s , the YMCA took over the game and spread basketball up and down both coasts . As early as 1892 , Brooklyn contracted basketball fever . In Philadelphia it threatened to take over all the city 's gymnasiums . Audiences turned violent , especially when referees made unpopular rulings . As historian Keith Myerscough phrased it , YMCA officials began to recoil from Naismith 's " Frankenstein-type monster that was now creating havoc in certain quarters . " The Frankenstein only grew larger . // And entrepreneurial . In 1896 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered they could make money from charging admission . Each player received fifteen dollars per game , a princely sum during the economic depression of the mid-1890s . When they defeated a Brooklyn team 16-1 , " The Trentons " began an American tradition by entitling themselves " World Champions . " Within two years , an entire professional league appeared  --  six teams in New Jersey and Pennsylvania  --  which lasted until 1903 . Basketball , it seemed , could produce profits as well as save souls . This was too much for Naismith 's old YMCA boss , Luther Gulick . " When men commence to make money out of sport , it degenerates , " Gulick lamented . " It has resulted in men of lower character going into the game . " The YMCA would not allow " The Trentons " to play in a Y gymnasium. // It no longer made much difference , however , what the YMCA did . Basketball was not only profiting play-for-pay teams , but producers of equipment . Albert Spalding , for example , had grown wealthy by the 1890s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned to be the John D. Rockefeller of sports : as Rockefeller ruthlessly integrated the global oil business from drilling to sales , Spalding integrated the sporting-goods business from his own manufacturing plants to sales in over twenty thousand retail accounts . Spalding even went Rockefeller one better : he published and distributed tens of thousands of guidebooks that instructed players and audiences about rules , while providing information about teams . Not surprisingly , the rules often called for Spalding equipment . As Naismith 's soccer-type ball gave way to an inflated basketball ( slightly larger than the modern version ) , Spalding efficiently produced and sold the new ball , now standard for the game . // Basketball was also becoming international . Two years after the 1891 game at Springfield College , a YMCA instructor introduced the sport in France . It had already been played by British women that year and by British men the year before . In 1894 , YMCA missionaries supervised the first contests in China and India , and Persia soon joined the list . Canada produced both the sport 's founder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The game , however , would not become an international phenomenon until Michael Jordan appeared on the scene . In its early years , it was largely American , with some popularity in Canada and Western Europe . More precisely , it was an American city game . The first dribbling of the ball ( instead of merely passing ) , apparently occurred on a Philadelphia playground in the late 1890s . The wave of immigrants entering the United States between 1890 and 1914 discovered the sport in city settlement houses , YMCAs , and even places of worship . It seemed nearly perfect for new arrivals . The game could be played on small city lots ; the players needed nothing more than a ball and some kind of hoop . Jewish youngsters came to dominate New York City tournaments . After all , as The American Hebrew observed , the sport required " quick thinking , lightning-like rapidity of movement and endurance ; it does not call for brutality and brute strength . " And for the immigrants , it was unquestionably an American game . As Ted Vincent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt 's New Deal urban coalition in the 1930s of Jews , Catholics , and Blacks . " // The first professional team to make a lasting mark on the sport was the New York Celtics called the Original Celtics ) , formed in 1921 . The Celtics , along with two teams made up of African-Americans  --  the Harlem Rens and the Harlem Globetrotters  --  became the most successful clubs in both profitability and in the way they reshaped the game , making it more fluid , graceful , and exciting to watch . These three teams dominated professional basketball during most of the first half of the twentieth century . // They were helped by new rules that changed the sport . Violence resulting from players chasing balls into the audience stopped when a high fence of chicken wire was placed around the floor . Players thus became known as " cagers , " and fights with fans diminished . The wire was removed in most gyms by the time the Celtics and Rens appeared . But no rules could turn basketball into the noncontact sport Naismith wished for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , recalled that " We wore hip pads , knee guards , and an aluminum cup . " Cut faces or " a loosened tooth were common injuries , " he remembered . Players did not like to jump , one of them recalled , because " They 'd just knock you into a wall . " // Yet with this crowd-pleasing bloodletting also came rules that encouraged crowd-pleasing imagination , speed , and subtlety . For years , baskets were simply attached to long poles . By World War I , however , they were on square " backboards " that allowed players to bank shots from fascinating angles . Until the 1930s , after each basket the referee stopped play and went to center court to toss the ball in the air for opposing players to tap into play . This break aimed at lowering the violence . By the eve of World War II , however , the center jump disappeared . Instead , the team that scored gave the ball over to the other team . Players , especially from the West Coast , began shooting daringly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully planned , time-consuming , two-handed set shot . // By the late 1930s these changes helped make basketball the rage . Time magazine in 1940 believed that its seventy thousand teams made basketball America 's largest sport . Women 's basketball also grew popular again after some puritanical types , including First Lady Lou Henry Hoover , led a crusade in the 1920s to make the sport more " ladylike " and less exciting . The Amateur Athletic Union , which sponsored many women 's sports , responded by running beauty contests at the women 's national championships . The players themselves competed in the contests . Many angrily protested this kind of ticket-selling , as they did when professional teams , such as the Golden Cyclones  --  led by one of the greatest all-around athletes of the century , Mildred " Babe " Didrikson  --  played in shorts and jerseys . But , as historian Allen Guttmann noted , " The uniforms boosted attendance from under 200 to some 5000 a night . " // Unfortunately for the men , such uniforms did little to increase attendance at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in middle-sized Eastern and Midwestern cities , lasted from 1926 until the Depression year of 1931 . Those few in media who followed the pros preferred the stars playing with the Rens , Globetrotters , and Celtics. // Finally , in the flush postwar year of 1946 , modern professional basketball was born , after a long hard labor . The ten-year-old National Basketball League ( NBL ) was challenged by a new league , the Basketball Association of America ( BAA ) . The BAA had three strengths : its teams were sponsored by arena owners who had money as well as attractive places in which to play ; these owners lived in large city markets where media attention and attendance were at a maximum ; and the owners used their cash to lure away NBL stars  --  including one later selected as the greatest player of the 1900 to 1950 years , George Mikan . At 6 ' 10 " , Mikan was the first well-coordinated giant who could both dominate a game and pull in fans who would pay to watch his graceful hookshot . By 1949 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Basketball Association ( NBA ) that has embodied the professional sport throughout the rest of the century . // In the 1950s it was clear that smaller cities such as Syracuse and Rochester , New York , could produce good teams , but not enough fans and media to pay for stars . Thus the 6 ' 10 " All-American of the University of San Francisco , Bill Russell , announced he would not play in a small city such as Rochester , which had draft rights to him . The Boston Celtics worked out an intricate deal to obtain Russell . He led Boston to eleven championships in thirteen years . By 1963 , the Rochester and Syracuse franchises had moved to larger metropolitan areas . The NBA thus was located in , and ultimately saved by , the biggest media markets . // In 1952 , the Dumont Television Network first aired a pro game . Two years later , the NBA dramatically sped up the game by introducing the twenty-four-second clock . Now the team having the ball could no longer slow the pace or stall while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The speedy game , with its restricted space that a camera could easily cover ( as opposed , say , to baseball , where television could at any moment show only a part of the action ) , already lent itself well to television . The NBA Commissioner , businessman Maurice Podoloff , saw to it that teams supplied free player photos to the media . He strongly discouraged team owners from releasing bad news ( such as low gate receipts ) . Podoloff and the NBA were beginning to understand the importance of marketing and public relations , and how to manipulate both . // In the 1960s and early 1970s , the NBA reached new heights of popularity and profit . Fans avidly followed individual matchups , especially the intense rivalry between two African-Americans , Boston 's Bill Russell and Philadelphia 's 7 ' 1 " Wilt Chamberlain who , except when guarded by Russell , was the game 's greatest scorer . In 1975 a rival league tried to tap into the game 's popularity . The American Basketball Association , however , lacked the financial backing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survival . By the time Michael Jordan turned professional , the ABA had been forced to merge with the NBA. // But as Jordan left Chapel Hill , the NBA itself was stumbling . Revelations of extensive drug use by players , increased violence on the court , and the retirement of Russell and Chamberlain began to raise the question of whether professional basketball could survive . The ABA , however , had given the NBA a life-saving present : Julius " Dr. J " Erving , whose leaping , floating , and slam dunks astonished fans . Erving 's elegance , both on and off the court , helped cleanse the game and prepared the sports world for Michael Jordan . And back of Erving stood the ghosts of at least a half-century of great African-American players who had overcome immense obstacles to prepare the world for Erving , Jordan , and others . // ( Continues ... )
