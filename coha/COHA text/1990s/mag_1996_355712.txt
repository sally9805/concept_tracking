The day after his return from Washington , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met in his office with TIME Jerusalem bureau chief Lisa Beyer . As the weekend approached , Netanyahu appeared relaxed and untroubled , laughing at times in the interview . Excerpts : <P> TIME : Are you prepared to acknowledge that opening the tunnel exit was not wise ? <P> Netanyahu : Well , I think it was very hard to anticipate that the issue would serve as an opportunity to foment violence . But I think we have to understand there are innumerable issues that could serve that purpose . My main concern is that we restore the standard that no issue leads to violence , that violence is not a negotiating tactic . What will we do the next time we have an impasse ? The next time there 's a grievance ? <P> TIME : If you were a Palestinian , how do you think you would regard Netanyahu ? <P> Netanyahu : If I read the controlled Palestinian media , I would think that , as they call me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Palestinian could see you for what you really are ? <P> Netanyahu : I think they would regard me as a person who believes deeply in the necessity of peace and that we do n't have another partner other than the Palestinian Authority . I think that any Palestinian mother reading this should understand that I am as deeply conscious of her pain of losing her child as I am of a Jewish mother 's . <P> TIME : Has your understanding of the Palestinian view improved ? <P> Netanyahu : It seems to me that the Palestinians are suffering from two main burdens . One is the economic burden that is a function of the security situation , especially the closure of Israel to Palestinian workers . I explained to Arafat that the degree of closure is directly related to the degree that he fulfills his security obligations . <P> Secondly , it has been said in an unending chorus , not only in Palestinian circles but throughout the Arab world , that Netanyahu does n't want peace . And if it 's repeated often enough , it assumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> TIME : At the time of the violence , you said Arafat " cynically " manipulated the tunnel issue ? Has your perception changed ? <P> Netanyahu : No . The kind of rhetoric , articles and broadcasts that we found in the Palestinian media well before the incidents and especially during the incidents were inflammatory to the point of violence . Since the Palestinian media are directed by the Palestinian Authority , it is responsible for ensuring that this incitement ceases . Arafat said he would take care of the breaches . <P> TIME : Has your appreciation of him changed ? <P> Netanyahu : Well , you get to know somebody better , and you can judge intentions and personality better . The important thing is it improved the communication between us . Nevertheless inherently we represent different perspectives and different interests . <P> TIME : Arafat can be charming . <P> Netanyahu : Sure . But I would n't make too much of the personal thing between us . <P> TIME : I was trying to get you to say that Arafat is a nice guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , and I 'll say it about him .
