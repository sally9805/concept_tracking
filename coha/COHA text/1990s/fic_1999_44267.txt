The kids wanted the family together at Christmas , even if their parents were divorced . So Ellen agreed to let Tom come over , knowing it could be the toughest test she 'd ever faced . <p> A month before Christmas , Ellen began to wonder about her children-wonder and worry . They . were so good ; they did their homework without having to be reminded , kept their rooms tidy , cleared up after meals . Rick fed and walked the dog , Scamp , without complaining , and Nancy cleaned out the small closet under the stairs . When they were younger , this sort of thing happened because they believed that Santa brought presents only to well-behaved children , an idea she and Tom had been happy to go along with . But now Rick was 15 , Nancy , 13 , and their days of believing in Santa were long past . And in any case , they , d had a sensible discussion abut Christmas presents and had decided that this year Nancy would receive a year of ballet classes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week with his chess club . Ellen considered sharing her concerns about the children with Tom when he came to pick them up on the weekend . Not for the first time , she was glad that , since the divorce , she and Tom had maintained a polite and civilized relationship . It might have been different , she knew , if he had married the girl . But the only time they 'd talked about that , he told her that neither of them had ever thought of marriage . " Then why , " Ellen had asked , trying to hide her hurt and bewilderment . He 'd shaken his head . " I do n't know , " he replied , wearily . " Ellen ... " But it was too late for the plea in his eyes , in his voice . It had been too late from the moment she found the hotel bill in his pocket . I 'm not wasting another moment of my life going over that again , Ellen told herself firmly . It 's done with . But Tom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that she-was worried about them . Nonetheless , she decided to wait a bit . It seemed foolish , after all , to be concerned because Rick and Nancy were behaving so well . However , by the middle of December , when Ellen felt like she was living with two angels instead of two normal teenagers , she had had enough . She returned from shopping one day , and instead of having to make her voice heard above loud music or pry the phone away from a determined hand , they came out to the car and started unloading the groceries the moment she drew up . When the bags were lined up on the kitchen table , Ellen took a deep breath and turned to face her children . " I want to know what 's up with you two , " she said firmly . " What 's going on ? " ( continued ) " Going on@ " Nancy said guilelessly , her blue eyes-Tom 's eyes-wide and innocent . " Nothing , Mom . We just like helping you . " They were words to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she also knew her children . She put her hands on her hips and kept her eyes on the two faces . " Give , " she said . Photograph <p> After a moment , Rick and Nancy looked at each other , and a small , wordless exchange passed between them . Then Nancy took a deep breath and said , " We want Dad to spend Christmas with us . " And once that was out , she went on quickly , " He 's on his own , Mom , and Christmas is an awful time to be alone . " He should have thought of that three years ago , Ellen thought , but she knew she could n't say that , not to her children . Instead she said , " I do n't think that would be a good idea . " " Why not ? " Rick asked , and Ellen 's heart turned over at the almost imperceptible unsteadiness of his voice . He was so tall , and his voice was deep , yet for a moment , she could see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't , " she told him , more sharply than she meant to . Then , regretting that sharpness , she said gently , " It 's just-asking too much . " Once again , Rick 's eyes met Nancy 's . " What about forgiveness and the Christmas spirit ? " he asked , and his chin jutted out just the way Tom 's did when he was making a point . Ellen did n't know what to say to that . I do n't know if I can forgive or forget , she thought . Ever . She tried to smile . I do n't think I could take the Christmas spirit quite that far , " she said quietly . " Look , Dad and I have tried hard to be very civil to each other since the divorce , and like we told you , we love both of you very much , and nothing will ever change that@ but , no , we could n't spend Christmas together . " " Dad would like it , " Nancy said shakily , and her blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verv much . " A rush of anger at Tom swept through Ellen . " Did he ask you to ask me ? Was this his idea ? " Rick and Nancy both shook their heads , and Ellen knew they were telling the truth . " No , it was our idea , " Rick said . " But we asked him , and he said he would like it . " Now Nancy 's tears were running down her cheeks . " We hate to think of Dad so lonely on Christmas Day , " she said . Ellen could n't bear the tears , and she put her arm around her daughter and hugged her . Nancy 's voice was muffled now . " The three of us will have one another , " she said , " but Dad will have nobody and . - - and ... oh , Mom , could n't we please ask him over ? " That was the point at which Ellen knew she was going to give in , with Nancy 's small shoulders shaking against her and Rick 's eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , her voice low . " But I 'm doing it for you two , not for your father . " I must be out of my mind , she thought when they went off to phone Tom . I just know this is n't a good idea . And for the first time another thought struck her . She 'd have to make it very clear to Tom-and to Rick and Nancy-that she was agreeing to Christmas Day , nothing more . If any of them thought that this meant she could forget what had happened , they were wrong . Nancy came running in , carrying the phone . " Dad wants to speak to you , " she said , breathless , her eyes bright now , her cheeks pink . Ellen took the phone . " Ellen ? " Tom 's voice was guarded . " Are you sure this is all right ? " I wo n't say that , Tom , " she returned evenly . " But it obviously means a great deal to the children , so ... " And then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want you to think- " She heard him sigh . " It 's all right , Ellen , I do n't think anything , " he said . " But thank you for agreeing to Christmas Day . " Christmas Day and nothing more , Ellen told herself as she put down the phone . But it was n't to be as straightforward as that , she found . The next weekend , when Tom brought Rick and Nancy back from their Sunday visit with him , she looked out the window and saw , to her dismay , that instead of giving a quick wave and driving off , Tom was getting out of the car and following the children to the back door . " Hello , Ellen , " he said from the doorstep , obviously uncertain of his reception . I wanted to have a word with you about the food for Christmas . " You could have done that on the phone , she told him silently . She could n't say it aloud , not in front of Nancy and Rick , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen floor , his eyes fixed on Tom 's face . " You 'd better come in , " she said , ungraciously . And she wondered , as he closed the door behind him , if he was thinking , as she was , that it was the first time he 'd been inside the house since she 'd asked him to leave . " I do n't want you to have to do any extra cooking , " he said then , standing beside the kitchen counter . " I thought I 'd bring a ham , already cooked . " " The turkey I plan to roast will be enough for four , " she told him dismissively . " But I 'd like to do something , Ellen , " Tom replied firmly , his chin jutting just the way Rick 's did . " All right , " she said . " The ham will be a nice addition . " She hesitated-it was cold and wet out , and he was thinner , his eyes darker , somehow-then said , " Would you like some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprisingly , there was a gleam of laughter in his eyes , and she knew it was at the way she 'd worded her reluctant invitation . Thank you , I would , " he replied , and sat down on the stool Rick pushed toward him . Suddenly , treacherously , there was a hard knot in Ellen 's throat at the sight of Tom , in this kitchen , this house that had been their home . She turned away to pour the coffee . " ' Well , did you all have fun today , " " she asked brightly It was Rick who replied . " I would n't call going over math exactly fun , " he said . Ellen turned back in time to see him smile at his father . Tom always had been conscientious about the children 's schoolwork , before and after the divorce . She had to allow him that " And you , " " Tom asked her . " Sell any good houses lately ? " ( Continued ) It was a family joke , from the time she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was mean of him to say it . She looked at him , almost ready to say that , but she saw , with wonder , that he had n't meant it in any mean spirit . He 'd simply wanted to know . " Almost , " she said , and reluctantly she returned his tentative smile . " I will have , if Mrs. Carlton can persuade her husband that he ca n't live without a sunken bath and a dining room that could seat twenty . " Then , just to be polite , to show interest , she asked him about changes at the bank where he worked , changes the children had told her about . IT WAS STRANGE AND A LITTLE DISTURBing , she thought after he 'd gone , to have him there , to be talking to him . Since the divorce , their contact had been limited to only what was necessary : twice in the lawyer 's office ; a few times when he 'd brought the children home and she 'd been outside , in the garden or walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been made on the phone , brief and businesslike . I should never have agreed to have him here for Christmas , she thought more than once . But she found herself baking pies and pastries the week before Christmas . The last lime I did this was three years ago , she thought , as she cut out small circles of dough and filled them with mincemeat , which neither Rick nor Nancy liked . It was only a few weeks after that Christmas that Ellen had found the hotel bill in the pocket of a suit she was taking to the cleaners . " How long has it been going on ? " she 'd asked Tom that night , pride keeping her voice tight , controlled , steady . " Not long , and it 's over , Ellen , you must believe me . She asked for a transfer to another bank because I-we  --  knew it was over . Ellen , I 'm so very sorry . I do n't know what more to say . " But I knear what to sav , Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make any difference . She wanted him to go . And I was right , she told herself . Of course , I was right . But as she took the mincemeat tarts out of the oven , golden brown and spicy , she knew that somewhere deep inside there was a sense of uneasiness . Could she have given him-given them-a chance to sort things out ? THE POPULAR BRITISH TRADITION OF Christmas crackers-the colorful tubes that pull apart with a loud snap and contain a party hat , printed joke , and small , plastic toy-had always been a part of their family holiday celebration , and Tom insisted he would get them this year . Ellen assumed he would bring them when he came mid-morning on Christmas Day . But on the twenty-second , she came home from the grocery store to find him in his car waiting , a redand-gold box of crackers in his hand . " I thought you 'd be bringing them on Christmas Day , " she said , taken aback by a completely unexpected moment Of pleasure at seeing him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " I thought you might want them ahead of time . " He followed her into the kitchen , holding out the box to her , a little awkwardly . In spite of herself , Ellen felt her lips twitch . She tried , not very successfully , to hide a smile . " It does n't take long to put four crackers on the table , Tom , " she pointed out . " Coffee ? " She took the box from him and set out two mugs . " Did the kids tell you that we 're going for the tree tomorrow ? " he asked . She nodded . " I 've asked old Ed Harris if we could cut down one of his . I wondered if you 'd like to come with us , Ellen " For a moment@ she could see the four of them , in coats , scarves , and gloves , walking through the field , choosing a tree , Tom and Rick cutting it down , carrying it to the car-just as they used to do . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom 's eyes , and she turned away , busying herself putting away the groceries . CHRISTMAS DAY DAWNED CLEAR AND COLD , but the sky was heavy enough for Rick and Nancy to tell each other there just might be snow later . " Hurry , we 'll be late for church , " Ellen called to them , remembering , with a pang , previous Christmases when they 'd had to be pried away from the contents of bulging stockings . " We wo n't be long , Scamp , " Nancy told the dog , giving him a biscuit as they stood in the hallway . Rick was grabbing his jacket and Ellen was putting on a scarf when the doorbell rang . She knew as she opened it that it was Tom . " I know I 'm supposed to come later , " he said quickly , " but I wanted to go to church with you . And here 's the ham . It just needs to be reheated . " He looked like Rick , Ellen thought , caught in the middle of committing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the ham from him and put It in the kitchen . " Ellen ? " Tom said , in a low voice , as she was locking the front door . " Is it all right that I 'm here ? " And suddenly it was . " Yes , " she said , " It 's all right . " ELLEN ALWAYS LOVED THE CHRISTMAS morning service . She 'd even loved it in the years after she and Tom parted : the church , warm and bright after the cold outside ; the nativity scene ; the traditional hymns ; and the Christmas story , read today by a little girl with a brown ponytail and a soft , earnest voice , who reminded Ellen of Nancy at 7 or 8 . While the congregation sang , Ellen looked at Rick next to her , his voice deep and true , at Nancy 's dark head bent over her hymnbook , and at Tom , his head bent , too , as he sang the familiar words . He looked up then and smiled , a smile Ellen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended and the congregation filed out , wishing each other a Merry Christmas , shivering , pulling on caps and gloves . Ellen was conscious of a few curious glances , but to her own surprise , she did n't mind . " I think it will snow , it 's cold enough , " Nancy said excitedly . She put her mittened hand in Ellen 's . " It certainly is , " Ellen agreed . " Let 's go home . " Home . She saw the hope in Tom 's eyes , and in her children 's eyes-their children 's eyes . I need time , she thought , but perhaps ... She said it again : " Let 's go home . " Author Affiliation Isobel Stewart has been a frequent contiibutor to Good Housekeeping since 1974 .
