COUNTED ELEVEN BITES on myself . Mosquitoes ? Ticks ? <p> Bedbugs ? On my feet , ankles , calves , thighs . Stomach , midriff , where my ribs stretched my tight skin . One on the underside of my tiny left breast . There was a fascination in it : some were angry new swellings that , miserable from the itching , I 'd made bleed with my nails . Others were older bites that had begun to heal and I 'd roused again with my roving nails . Sometimes my entire lower body throbbed with itching , especially at night when I could n't sleep my heart beating too fast and it was like my skin had gone crazy and turned mutinous against itself and I 'd bite my lip hard holding off as long as I could until tears spilled from my eyes and I could n't bear it one more second and in a luxury of abandon sobbing with relief I would rake my nails hard hard HARD against the bleeding bumps and welts . <p> Oh God oh God oh . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ' lavatories at Mt . Ephraim High School . And maybe on outside walls , I did n't know . I did n't look , and I did n't know . My boyfriends were a shifting lot . A guy crazy about me one night might not seem to notice me when I walked into the cafeteria next day . I had close girlfriends , but they talked about me behind my back . I knew , but I did n't know in such a way that they knew-that had to be the basis of my friendships . And with guys , too . There has to be some basis . You ca n't trust them , but you do n't want them to know because then they wo n't like you at all . One of the men teachers must 've seen something ugly on a wall because I was called one day to the infirmary , where the school nurse asked me in this sort of embarrassed voice did I have anything to ask her ? Any questions of a personal-medical nature ? I did , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I sat there staring at the floor , my face gone hot . Scratched at something itchy on the inside of my elbow till I drew blood . <p> I was fifteen years old now , and in tenth grade . I was small for my age , lanky-armed and - legged , had n't begun my periods yet which would 've made me a freak if anybody knew but I kept that secret for sure . <p> I felt very mature to myself . No matter how I looked . Calling my mother MOTHER now and not MOMMA . I hated that baby name ! <p> Thinking of Momma , I mean Mother . And my nails start roaming . <p> Weird : scratching an old almost healed bite or sore , my nails would discover a new one I 'd swear had n't been there a minute before . Strangeshaped , striated rashes or swellings , maybe a pimple , a hive , caused by some mysterious allergy . Fewer bites on my face , which was damned lucky . But overnight there might appear a string of nasty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hell . Mysterious bites , bumps on my scalp . Once , a bump the size of a robin 's egg-Momma , I mean Mother , decided it had to be a spider bite . Those tiny poison-ivy pustules sprouting between my fingers I 'd SCRATCH SCRATCH SCRATCH till they burst and a runny liquid leaked from them but the itching only got worse . Scratch off my skin in patches but the itching only got worse . <p> Terrible itching-throbbing inside my right ear once in grade school I was almost crazy with it desperate poking a sharp pencil inside my ear and the teacher grabbed my hand and took me to the nurse and she said my God you 've got poison ivy inside your ear . I 'd spread the hard little pustules from my ankles to my ear , on my nails . <p> This woman I was learning to call Mother stared at me sometimes appalled , disgusted , or guilty-acting-so many insect bites , obviously our apartment was n't clean . What kind of a housekeeper is Chloe Boone ? It was true we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment at 119 Mohawk Street , and there was an inexhaustible supply of ants of various sizes rising through the floorboards or marching along exposed pipes or tracking across the kitchen ceiling to drop , like exclamation points , in somebody 's plate . You could spray and spray and spray until you were sick to your stomach , but it would n't help , much . There were spiders coming into the house as the weather cooled , and a spider bite hurts . In warm weather there were mosquitoes . And there were ticks which were the nastiest the most indestructible of all insects , you had to dig a tick out of your flesh with a sterilized pin and if part of the tick broke off and was left inside then the bite would become infected and you 'd have a fever , nausea . And such wild itching . And there were bedbugs once , to Mother 's shame , though she would never admit to it , the one thing you never admitted to was bedbugs ( or some even worse thing pubic lice I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Pubic ? - lice ? <p> Never mind , Mother said . <p> One day soon I would learn what pubic lice were . But not just yet . <p> My boyfriends were kept secret from Mother out of spite not wanting her to know Guys love me too-not just you . I counted so many listing them in my notebook * * * then Xing them out when we broke up which was sometimes only a few days after we 'd begun going together . None of it had much to do with me , but I kept a scrupulous record . <p> Mother was hurt I never wore the clothes she sewed for me now . Never wore dresses , skirts-nobody did . Sweaters , jeans , jackets , boots . A few of the guys-older ones I 'd meet downtown-gave me money , and I 'd buy clothes , funky hip-hugger belts , once a Timex watch with a goodlooking leather band . Mother saw and asked where 'd that come from , and I said what ? where did what come from ? and slammed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call , I did n't have to take any shit from her . <p> MOTHER I was calling her not MOMMA though sometimes I 'd slip and say MOMMA and she 'd pretend not to notice though I knew she 'd be smiling , that was the kind of thing made her smile . Much of the time MOTHER was strange on my lips like I 'd been shot with novocaine . And strange to my mother 's ears , hurtful , like some kind of secret insult . She 'd beg me for God 's sake Ingrid stop scratching , what are you doing to yourself ? Do you want to scar your face ? <p> Tried to forbid me but even in her watchful presence I could rake my nails lovingly in secret across my serrated skin , draw pinpoints of blood and take a spiteful pleasure in it . I never thought of scarring , of permanent injury like some faces you see pocked from acne , I thought only of SCRATCHING . <p> During summers , which were so hot , humid , airless , the insect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parking in their cars or pickups-there , out on the ground , that 's where you pick up ticks . But the mosquitoes were everywhere , even with our screened windows . Sometimes in fascination I 'd count twenty , twenty-five , even thirty insect bites , from between my toes to my scalp , the very act of counting them repulsive to Mother ( who had her own bites , not so many but enough . She 'd douse them with stinging Noxzema , the smell of which made me sickish ) . A certain kind of beer made me break out in hives within minutes , plus chocolate , citrus fruits , potato chips , and cola drinks , coffee too ( it was said because of the caffeine ) , but I avoided none of these , I took a morbid interest in experimenting : how many minutes after I ate a candy bar would the first itchy red bump appear ? Or maybe it was nerves . One of Mother 's man friends , Mr. Dilts of Dilts Hardware , said of me that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to winking and his tongue moist in the corner of his mouth . <p> No one hated and feared doctors more than my mother . It had been a Yewville doctor , she always said , who 'd let her baby boy die of meningitis he had n't treated quick enough , the baby had died of medical neglect because the parents had n't had hospital insurance . Yet Mother insisted upon taking me to a doctor in Mt . Ephraim to examine my bites , rashes , lumps , pimples , hives , but that day it was n't too bad , the doctor diagnosed just normal adolescent-type skin plus a few insect bites like everybody has more or less , what 's the problem ? Charged us thirty-five dollars for a five-minute examination and made out a prescription for a few ounces of a greasy ointment in a tube , had less effect than Noxzema and cost ten times as much . <p> I refused to get in the car with Mother to drive home . I said , " If you were n't always watching me , Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , Mother was n't watching me at all , she had her own life I did n't give a shit for . I had my friends , lots of friends , and even if I did n't I had my poetry I wrote showing only my English teacher who praised me , Miss Elsworth was my only friend you might say . Because how could I trust anybody else . <p> Mother was putting more and more emphasis on how she looked , now she was getting older , and older began to show . Still she was goodlooking , and knew how to dress . Gorgeous was a favorite word of hers she used a lot in conversation , one of her man friends greeted her with it : Hi Gorgeous ! I 'd overhear , and roll my eyes . Still , Mother looked OK . In Flora Wells 's Shop where I 'd spy on her sometimes when walking past she had the look of a stranger who belonged in that plush rose interior , her hair in a French twist and nails lacquered and face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and " freshened up " during the day . Mother was an expert at disguising blemishes on her own skin , her skin that was sensitive too , erasing as if by magic dark circles beneath her eyes . She wore Revlon lipsticks , deep earthy-crimson colors , plum-bronze , sometimes a frosty melon-pink the same color Mt . Ephraim cheerleaders wore . Plus eyeliner , mascara , smoky-blue eye shadow to make her eyes enormous . There were painkiller pills she got from a friend to help her through hangover mornings , and these made her eyes moist , dreamy . At the dress shop Mother was always the lady , for sure ! Wearing the expensive clothes Flora Wells sold her customers . Other times , weekends especially , Mother wore bright lipstick , her hair loose on her shoulders and frizzed until it seemed to float about her head , snug-fitting velvet pants , miniskirts or - dresses , white leather disco boots , sexy earrings . Saying it did n't matter if the man you 're with is nobody you much care for , other men will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other men , the men you have n't yet met , one of them who 'll maybe change your life , that you 're fixing yourself up for . <p> Why I came to have such quarrels with my mother , to hate and wish dead my mother , I do n't know . There was hardly anything she ever told me that did n't turn out to be true . <p> The day I counted eleven bites on myself was the day I was scheduled to read a poem at the awards assembly at the high school . I knew it was a terrible mistake to agree to read a poem , any poem , but especially a poem by Ingrid Boone everyone would sneer at , and maybe they would laugh at me . I hated my teacher Miss Elsworth who had talked me into such a thing . Saying do n't be silly Ingrid you know you can do it . It will be a challenge because you 're a shy girl but how good you 'll feel afterward . How proud . And your family , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's poetry prize unprecedented in my memory that a sophomore should win . Of course you ca n't decline ! Do n't be silly you can practice beforehand . I can coach you . Are n't you proud . Why are n't you proud . I 'm proud for you ! You were my nominee . Do n't let me down . And it 's fifty dollars . Congratulations ! <p> Mother regarded me with worried eyes-she 'd heard me up during the night using the toilet , my guts turned to liquid fire . I was obsessed the kids at the assembly would ridicule me . Did n't I hear muffled laughter in the cafeteria , at my locker Doll , Doll-girl , Hey Doll-girl : do me ? And the poetry I wrote was shit , and I knew it . Even the twelve-line poem that had won the poetry " competition . " I should have screamed at Miss Elsworth to leave me alone for God 's sake , I was n't worthy of any prize did n't she know the fuck who I was ! <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school paper , exposing INGRID BOONE to public wonderment and derision . In fact I was very excited , delirious . My life would be changed . All my teachers and Mr. Cantry the principal would see my poems , and all the kids , my enemies and my friends , for I did have friends , I counted my friends on my fingers compulsively during classes , or annotated their names in my notebook , Xing out , adding , marking * when somebody betrayed me . Of course , nothing was changed . There were three short poems in the paper , misprints in all three , even in the title of one so I could not show it to Mother even out of spite . Then I changed my mind and showed her . I was feverish seeing INGRID BOONE in print and was not sure if any of this was real . Mother frowned and read the poems two or three times . " You tell too much , Ingrid , " Mother said finally . " A thing like this should scare you more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out can be a curse . " <p> Her pronouncements were often mysterious . And more with each passing year . Her eyes all pupil , like she could see in the dark . <p> That morning Mother wanted to make me up , eager to make me gorgeous for my performance she and Mr. Dilts were going to attend together . First time in two years Chloe Boone had set foot in Mt . Ephraim High School though some of my teachers and the guidance counselor and Mr. Cantry had sent notes asking to see her . It was Class Day , final day of classes for the school year . Graduation for seniors was the following week . <p> " No thanks , Mother , " I said . Peering into the bathroom mirror , picking at a swelling above my left eye , the thing throbbed and itched and seemed to have something in its center , an insect 's stinger maybeI was trying to remove it with tweezers . This was a delicate operation and Mother standing so close made me nervous . And she was looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hurt , her daughter she loved so calling her MOTHER and no longer MOMMA . But I would not weaken . Ever again . Pushing past her into my bedroom where I lit a cigarette , my hands shaking . " Mother , please do n't look at me . I 'm fine ! " <p> Mother said , " Ingrid , you are not ' fine , ' your face needs making up . Your complexion is sickly , what 's that on your forehead ? -I can fix it . C'm on ! " Clapping her hands brisk as a Girl Scout which was one of the weird roles she 'd play mornings when she was n't hungover . Smiling like the world is this blessed place , like the night before , or whenever , she had n't been in one of her moods wondering what the point of everything is , why the human race did n't give up after so many millennia . Millennia was a word Mother had gotten from TV , like ecology and saturated fats . <p> I shrank from Mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flora Wells 's in a beige wool suit with white piping she had sewed herself , and she exuded a sweet talcumy scent . Her face looked pretty good for a woman of thirty-three , which was such an old age I knew I would never live that long . I stooped to scratch a rash on the back of my knee and Mother scolded , " Ingrid , damn it , stop . It 's just nerves . " Slapping at my hand the way you 'd slap at a child , not wanting to hurt but out of vexation , disgust . Anything just nerves merits a slap . <p> Mother had to leave for Flora Wells 's around the time I would be leaving for school , and that time was fast approaching-8:10 A.M. The awards ceremony was at 4:30 P.M. and I could not comprehend how I would endure the intervening hours . There was the possibility of getting drunk , or high , my friends could help me out but if that happened how would I perform in front of an audience of over five hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , or kill myself . But I had not worked out any details . There was an older man I knew , in his late twenties , a trucker whose route was through Mt . Ephraim four times a week and we 'd gotten together a few times and last time he 'd said C'm on with me , Ingrid , teasing but more than just teasing , like he truly meant it , his marriage was finished so I was thinking I could call him , I had his number , I could meet him in Port Oriskany , I could take a bus out of Mt . Ephraim by 10:00 A.M. Leaving a message for Miss Elsworth So sorry I let you down , I know you can never forgive me dr would not expect it . <p> Mother was pushing close , I saw her nostrils widening , she hoped to smell if I 'd been sweating and had n't washed my underarms . Also she 'd snatched up my pack of Newports and bummed one without so much as a word of request or thanks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want me to come to the thing this afternoon , is that it ? " <p> My heart kicked . I turned away . I 'd known Mother would say this , these very words . I knew she would make it seem , if she did n't want to come , it was me who did n't want her to . She 'd be doing me a favor by not coming ! The selfish bitch . <p> I thought about the trucker , how his hands felt on me . He was an adult man , he had children . He would take care of me . <p> I was smoking my cigarette , and my hands were steadier . Calmly I said , " Do what you like , Mother . It 's what you 've always done . " <p> " What does that mean ? " <p> " What I said . " <p> " What the hell does it mean ? " <p> " You do what you want to do , and call it by some other name . " <p> " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mother , just leave me alone . I 'm nervous about this afternoon . I 'm going . " <p> Now she was MOTHER and no longer MOMMA except in secret times of weakness-it was like she was another person . Older , and her power lessened . Staring at me with these hurt eyes like I was the cruel one of us . Like I was reaching into her chest and squeezing her heart . I said , turning away , " I 'm going . Do n't come if you do n't want to . " <p> But Mother caught me then . Just a gentle touch of my arm , the way a guy once touched me a long time ago and he 'd become my first lover and I still loved him though I forgot his name in my dreams of him . Mother said , " OK , sweetie , but first let me make you gorgeous . Want to bet I ca n't ? " <p> What could I do , I gave in . The truth was , I wanted to be gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , swallowed down with lukewarm Coke . Cut my morning 's classes and went instead to the Mt . Ephraim Public Library , a weatherworn stone building beside the firehouse , frantically I searched through volumes of poetry looking for a poem I could read in place of my own , a poem that might be mistaken for a poem of mine except it would be a real poem , a worthy poem , by a real poet . I did not think this constituted theft , nor even plagiarism <p> I knew what plagiarism was . I was not thinking of that at all , but only of finding something worthy to read to an audience , not insulting an audience with a poem by INGRID BOONE . Not just students would be at the assembly but all the teachers , my tenth-grade teachers and teachers I would have in the future , and Mr. Cantry the principal , and parents , the parents of my classmates , and Mother and Mr. Dilts-I could not read my poem to them , the poem I 'd won a prize for was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yarrow in it that rhymed by accident , there were words perish of being that made no sense . The subject was a pilot , a man in a small plane flying so high above the earth at night he 'd lost his way , he was out of radio contact and his instruments were spinning because of electricity in the clouds and his gas tank was almost empty , all this crap was invented , I did n't know anything about flying a plane really , and a real pilot , if there was one in the audience , would laugh at my ignorance and expose me . The fancy cloud words cirrus , cumulus , stratus , that I 'd copied out of a dictionary . And there was a line a moment in a strange world I 'd stolen from a poem by Robert Frost not in our textbook . It amazed me that Miss Elsworth had n't recognized the line . Was n't she as smart as I 'd thought ? Or had she recognized it , and making me read the poem at the assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman I knew could be so calculatingly cruel , for had n't Miss Elsworth praised my writing and given me A 's for the past two years I 'd been her student ? But it might have been that the other teachers on the awards committee had talked her into the deception , or just possibly they had plotted behind her back and deceived her into agreeing to award the poetry prize to me in order that , at the assembly , at the very end of the school year , INGRID BOONE would be exposed and humiliated . And Miss Elsworth would be exposed and humiliated , tool So there was no choice but for me to find an authentic poem by an authentic poet and copy it into my notebook to read at the assembly . But my nerves were tight-strung and the painkillers and cola-caffeine were making my heart beat weirdly skipping every third or fourth beat then racing to catch up so I was having difficulty just holding books and leafing through their pages <p> without dropping them Help mel Help me God ! in whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same length as mine and a poem I could comprehend whose words I would be capable of reading without stammering . I was " made up " for the assembly and I was wearing a navy-blue dotted-swiss dress Momma , I mean Mother , had sewed for me , a good dress , and nice shoes , and I was sweating and breathing hard so the librarian poked her head around the stacks to see what the hell I was doing , hyperventilating at the back of the reference section , and she asked do you need any help miss and I said no ! no thanks ! I 'm OK and she looked at me like she was wondering why was n't I in school , she took note of my pretty-pretty dress and black ballerina flats worn with actual stockings so I did n't look like myself at all but another girl and possibly even a good girl and a good student so she said well if you need any help please let me know , and went away . <p> Through a tall narrow window the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at my watch a gap of time was missing . It required two hours of leafing through anthologies , some of them so heavy , their pages yellowed and cracked , books that had not been checked out of the library nor perhaps even glanced into in thirty years . So I believed I would be safe choosing poems from them . In a fever copying a dozen poems by poets whose names were vaguely familiar yet whose poems were not in our school text : William Blake , Samuel Taylor Coleridge , Elizabeth Barrett Browning , Dante Gabriel Rossetti , Thomas Hardy , A. E. Housman , but I left off their names because I would not be acknowledging the other poet . And as I copied into my notebook in my handwriting it seemed almost that the poems were mine , my inventions ! I reasoned that if a line by Robert Frost was not known to my English teacher , a poem by these older , less-read poets would not be known at all . <p> During this time my bites , rashes , pimples flared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were many more than eleven now , there must have been twenty , or thirty ! My face Mother had carefully made up was stiff and poreless with creamy Revlon foundation and a thick dusting of perfumy powder I knew I must not touch . I limited myself to scratching only what was hidden . Inside my clothes , inside my panties . The bites on my thighs were terrible . And the burning pebble-hard bite or pimple on the underside of my breast . The backs of my knees , where three-inch-long welts were raised matching the grooves of my raking nails , and it was tricky to scratch through the nylon stockings without causing a run and maybe I did cause a run , I could n't see . Do n't ! do n't , I was thinking as tentatively I touched my face-it was burning . Very cautiously like a blind person I touched the string of pimples at my hairline , lightly drawing my nails back and forth over them . Oh God this made them itch all the more . Terrible , terrible itching ! It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against me just the tip of the little ridge of flesh between my legs so stiff and aching and his breath so hot and quickened and the moaning in his throat he did n't hear Oh ! Jesus and I would bite my lip hard enough to draw blood not wanting to come , not wanting it to happen , not like that , so exposed . <p> Because I screamed and cried so , I could not help myself , and that scared them , even the older guys sometimes , it was ugly to them , and gross , I understood that other girls were not so wild and helpless and grabbing so and of course the good girls did not do such things at all , it was not required of them . So I should not have touched the pimples on my forehead , that was an asshole thing to do . Momma , I mean Mother , had rubbed them with alcohol to soothe the itching , then she 'd rubbed moisturizer over my entire face before applying the foundation and until I 'd touched it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it was alive and throbbing with itching . The bump above my eye I 'd removed the insect stinger from had swollen to twice its original size , and how it itched ! But I did n't dare touch it because that would only make the itching worse . And if I began to scratch , it would bleed through the makeup . And if I disturbed the makeup all Momma 's , I mean Mother 's , efforts would be in vain , for though sullen and red-eyed I did look OK , you might say pretty-pretty , yeah even gorgeous . I was fifteen , and with lipstick , a light shading of rouge on my cheeks , certain tricks of Momma 's , I could be made to look pretty good if you did n't look too close . If you did n't know I was INGRID BOONE . <p> By the time I finished copying the poems in my notebook scrawled and drunken-looking and my handwriting almost illegible it was afternoon , I 'd missed all my morning classes . And it was June 11 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even as I knew something terrible would happen , I was making a terrible mistake , I was feeling better . This was a frequent phenomenon and would characterize my life for years . Through the library window there was the same sky opaque and glaring like metal but you could imagine the sun behind it . I smiled , I was happy , almost . I 'd saved a third painkiller for just before the assembly . Had n't been realizing how I was scratching my itchy spots up and down my body except for my face and throat , raking my nails luxuriously and at all these points there was a burning sensation that might have been pain if I 'd been registering pain which I was not . It will be a challenge because you 're a shy girl . How proud . And your family , and your friends . And it 's fifty dollars . Congratulations ! <p> Before the awards assembly everyone in the program had to gather backstage , and by this time I 'd taken the painkiller and drunk three cans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't eaten anything all day . And I 'd been running to the restroom and peeing , having to pull down my pantyhose I was n't used to , and the itching on my thighs and belly so terrible I scratched and dug at my skin not giving a damn how the bites were bleeding , they were inside my clothes , and hidden . I had n't yet decided which poem to read , the poem would have the title " Lost " because that was the title of the prizewinning poem by INGRID BOONE listed in the awards program and I could not change that . During my afternoon classes I 'd been distracted looking through the poems and now backstage even as the assembly was about to begin I was still looking , standing off to one side as Mr. Cantry gave directions and not even pretending to listen so they noticed me , and Miss Elsworth said something to me but I did n't hear . Strange to me to be backstage behind the heavy velvet curtains , and to hear the noisy audience filing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the roaring churning rapids above a falls , carried unresisting to the falls and over . <p> My heart was beating erratically and I could not seem to catch my breath though the pills had made me sluggish , my legs heavy . I was gripping sheets of torn-out notebook paper trying to make my decision . <p> After today I would go to live with the trucker in Port Oriskany , I needed only to remember his last name , his first name was Mike . A trickle of sweat ran down my side beneath my dress and something was tickling-itching on my forehead that I brushed at with my nails . By this time the assembly had begun . To my horror Mr. Cantry had pushed through the curtains and the audience quieted and he began the program by leading them in the Pledge of Allegiance his voice booming like a voice in a movie and I saw that we who were backstage were not spared but had to place our right hands over our hearts chanting the familiar words like robots . And then there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a student pianist , both graduating seniors . And then a woman 's amplified voice , one of the senior teachers , the first of the awards Notable Achievement in Student Government . And then applause . A few whistles . It was a lively assembly , the last of the year , and some of the boys would be raucous , some might even be drunk , beer smuggled into their lockers , a few of the girls even , Ingrid Boone might 've been one of them , not trapped like I was , dragged closer and closer to the edge . It washed over me then with a sickening horror that Momma , I mean Mother , would be here , she and her man friend Mr. Dilts who was another woman 's husband " separated " like Momma was " separated , " and my classmates would see her , and him . <p> And I wanted them to know that Momma was my mother so much younger and better-looking than their mothers but I did n't want them to think that Mr. Dilts was my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my forehead , I brushed my hair out of my eyes . Dropped some of my papers and stooped to retrieve them and someone was whispering , " Ingrid ? " - it was Miss Elsworth staring at me appalled and handing me a tissue I stared dumbly at and did not take and so delicately , biting her lip , Miss Elsworth dabbed at my forehead above my eye where <p> I must have been scratching and started the bump bleeding without knowing what I did . The tissue was dotted with blood ! - Miss Elsworth crumpled quickly in her hand as if it were shameful , she whispered it might be better if I did n't touch my face . But I was distracted , on the other side of the curtain there was a roar of applause , and amplified voices , the athletic awards , an outburst of laughter , and more applause and whistles . The popular senior guys were out there receiving trophies , scholarship certificates . The president of the Mt . Ephraim Chamber of Commerce was giving a speech punctuated by jokes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the curtains , others were returning flush-faced and grinning . In desperation I 'd chosen a poem titled " Grief " whose author I did not know , one of the most obscure of the poems I 'd copied so seemingly one of the most poetic , my lips were moving as I read through it without comprehension like a braindamaged person . Miss Elsworth pushed out through the curtains to begin the literary announcements and her voice was reproduced backstage , amplified , remote , and scarcely recognizable . I thought If Momma is not here , I will never love her again and I will never be hurt by her again . <p> My heart was pounding so hard I had difficulty hearing the first name announced which was that of a boy , a senior who 'd been awarded the prize for fiction , and there was welcoming applause , and the boy 's voice unexpectedly confident , even droll , as he read from his winning story , and at the conclusion there was laughter , and more applause . And then I heard Miss Elsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that name had never struck me before . My legs had turned to lead , I could not move until someone nudged me-Ingrid ? this way , it was kindly Mr. Cantry himself guiding me as I blundered into the heavy curtains , groped my way out unprepared for the narrowness of the stage and the brightness of the lights and the nearness of the audience-the first several rows so close , the faces of individuals vividly clear , their eyes and expectant expressions , so near ! There had been a scattering of handclaps as my name was pronounced , and I stared out seeing so many eyes on me , I had imagined this moment for weeks , had endured it how many sleepless hours , yet I had always imagined the audience a vague blur like flooding water , a terrible presence yet without specific identity . But here were faces , here were faces of boys and girls I knew , boys and girls who knew me , I stood paralyzed as Miss Elsworth spoke of the annual poetry prize and the local poet who had endowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INGRID BOONE and felt very tired walking to the podium and unprepared for Miss Elsworth 's smile and brisk handshake for when had I shaken hands with any adult before , or with anyone at all ? - and she thrust at me a large stiff certificate with a gilt seal and an envelope and in my confusion <p> I dropped some of my papers and had to stoop to retrieve them my face pounding with blood . The audience by now was completely silent . I might have been alone in the auditorium . Miss Elsworth disappeared , and I stood on tiptoe at the podium staring at something I held in my hand , I smoothed the wrinkled sheet of paper uncertain whether this was in fact the poem I 'd finally chosen . I had intended to weave into the poem some of my own lines from " Lost " so that Miss Elsworth and anyone else who knew that poem would believe this to be a revision but I had n't had time , or I 'd forgotten . I had intended to announce the title " Lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a diver plunging into unknown water I began to read , staring at the words quivering in front of me I 'd never seen before and in some cases could not pronounce but had to repeat and even then it was not certain that I had pronounced them correctly , I brushed at my forehead , dug my nails pushing my damp hair out of my eyes , could n't catch my breath reading in a rapid then halting dazed fumbling voice- " I tell you , hopeless grief is passionless ; / That only men incredulous of despair , / Half-taught in anguish , through the midnight air/ Beat upward to God 's throne in loud access/ Of shrieking and reproach . Full desertness , / In souls as countries , lieth silent-bare/ Under the blanching , vertical eye-glare/ Of the absolute heavens . Deep-hearted man , express/ Grief for thy dead in silence like to death-/Most like a monumental statue set/ In everlasting watch and moveless woe/ Till itself crumble to the dust beneath. / Touch it ; the marble eyelids are not wet : / If it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read I felt a trickle of blood run down the side of my face , I swiped at it with my hand and smeared it on my cheek , wiped harder then tried to ignore it , wanting only to get through the poem , to get through . By the time I finished , the audience was even more silent . There were scattered coughs . I stared out terrified at the rows of faces , not knowing how to be released from their eyes . At last someone began applauding , it was <p> Miss Elsworth herself somehow beside me , and all the audience joined in , so it was over , blindly I turned and followed Miss Elsworth through the curtains and backstage breathing so quick and shallow I began to faint , Miss Elsworth and another woman asked did I want to lie down somewhere and I shook my head no ! no I was all right , winced when they touched me as if their fingers burnt . Mr. Cantry was headed for me angry-looking but Miss Elsworth turned me aside , shoved another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was bleeding along one cheek without my knowing it , or I 'd forgotten . Behind my back making a gesture so Mr. Cantry would leave me alone . I thought <p> She knows . Knows I stole that poem . They all know . But it was n't certain they knew-was it ? Probably they had n't even heard the poem , most of it , my voice so rushed and faltering . Miss Elsworth was telling me not to be upset , I had done well . The other woman teacher , and others backstage , were telling me I had done well , and congratulating me . Miss Elsworth added maybe I should go to a restroom and wash my face ? would I like her to accompany me ? I held the tissue to my forehead for the blood to soak in , it was shameful strangers should see my glistening blood , I did n't seem to hear Miss Elsworth or if I heard her her voice came from a distance and did not seem real . My head was heavy on my shoulders like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if my feet were mired in mud . I thought I would go somewhere and lie down , a dark corner of the backstage maybe . There were piles of what looked like canvas . At the same time I knew this was wrong , like a dream when you are in a public place needing to pee . Mr. Cantry and the others were talking about me . Had I taken some medication , was that the problem . <p> Part of the problem . Again Miss Elsworth seemed to be shielding me from Mr. Cantry and from the others who were staring . We were moving toward the door and I handed the certificate and the envelope to her , I knew the envelope contained a check for fifty dollars and Miss Elsworth said , surprised , " What 's this ? It 's yours , Ingrid , " and I meant to say I do n't deserve it but instead I said , " I do n't want it , " and Miss Elsworth protested , " It 's yours , Ingrid , " and I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Miss Elsworth pushed at my hand like she was ashamed for me , " It 's yours , it 's made out in your name . " <p> There was a reception following the assembly where we were supposed to go , there would be a photographer from the local newspaper , but I would not be there . And I would learn afterward that Mother had in fact been in the auditorium at the very rear but that she and Mr. Dilts had slipped away immediately after my appearance , that spectacle of Chloe Boone 's daughter on a lighted stage before five hundred people with blood running down the side of her face How could you Ingrid how could you God damn your soul to hell ! Mother and Mr. Dilts would not be at the reception , of course . Would not meet the other parents , and my teachers , of course . I would not see Mother for a day and a half . Miss Elsworth was suggesting again that I wash my face , and maybe I should go home instead of to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I whispered , " I 'm so ashamed , Miss Elsworth , I 'm sorry , " but she was already backing away and did n't hear me . I lifted my eyes to her face for the first time that day , steeling myself for what I 'd see in the woman 's eyes , how she pitied me and thinking how , if pity is strong enough , you wo n't be blamed . <p>
