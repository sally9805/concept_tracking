With the incredible advance in jwomen 's health care , picking the right physician is more important than ever . Here , our special guide to doctors other doctors trust most , in specialties ran from infertility to menopause . // Research today has resulted in more medical breakthroughs for women than ever-particularly when it comes to screening and treatment . That 's why being a fully informed medical consumer is so critical-and that means not only being smart about your choice of doctors , but also understanding your new options : Cancer Screening BREAST Thanks to increasingly sensitive mammography equipment , doctors are able to detect the disease earlier when it 's more curable , says William Droegemueller , M.D. , a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill . According to the American Cancer Society , the mortality rate has fallen by more than 5 percent over the past five years . CERVICAL The chance of missing an abnormality on a Pap smear ranges from 5 to 50 percent , often because of human error . Now , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papnet - can rescreen Pap smears , picking up warning signs that might he missed by lab technicians . Another new advance is ThinPrep , which makes cervical-cell samples easier for labs to evaluate . OVARIAN Doctors are making progress in finding a potentially more accurate way to screen for ovarian cancer , which strikes one in 70 . Because women often show no symptoms of the disease in its earliest stages , gynecologists have been unable to detect it soon enough to improve survival rates ( which remain at a low 25 percent five years after diagnosis ) , making it the deadliest gynecologic cancer of all . The National Cancer Institute ( NCI ) is studying several screening technologies that may help reduce the number of deaths from ovarian cancer . ( When caught early odds of survival are excellent . ) One method is a $40 blood test called CA125 , which detects a protein produced by the cancer . False-positive results are common , however . Another is vaginal ultrasound , a $200 test that uses sound waves to produce images . It allows doctors to detect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovaries . The NCI 's trial should be completed in a decade . Treatment FEWER HYSTERECTOMIES Removal of the uterus , and usually the cervix , or hysterectomy , is the second most common operation performed on women in the United States after Caesarean section . It 's usually done if a woman has fibroids - benign growths that can cause pain and bleeding - but it 's also done if a woman has heavy bleeding , endometriosis , or pelvic pain . Though the current number of hysterectomies - about 580,000 per year - is among the highest in the world , there 's been a 15 percent drop since 1980 , largely because of the emergence of less-invasive , less-costly procedures . These alternatives , some experimental , are steadily increasing . Among them : Uterine balloon therapy , in which the lining of the uterus is destroyed via heat inside a tiny balloon . Hysteroscoptic resection , which involves the use of a telescopic instrument with a cutting loop at the end . It enables doctors to locate fibroids , then shave them from the lining of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small fibroid tumors are removed with a scalpel , while the uterus is left intact . Myolysis , where fibroids are destroyed with an electrical current . Uterine artery embolization , which cuts off blood flow from a fibroid , thus shrinking it . HEALTHIER LIVING AFTER MENOPAUSE The risks of hormone replacement therapy are lower-and the health benefits broader-than were previously thought . While estrogen may slightly raise the risk of breast cancer , it 's been shown to halve the risks of heart disease , osteoporosis , and colon cancer . And preliminary research suggests that it may even delay or prevent progress of Alzheimer 's disease . SAFER , AFFORDABLE INFERTILITY TREATMENT A new type of in vitro fertilization , in which eggs and sperm are united outside a woman 's body then implanted in her womb , may allow women to forego costly and potentially risky hormone injections necessary to ripen eggs . ( One study has identified a link between these hormones and ovarian cancer . ) Called immature- ( oocyte retrieval the experimental procedure involves removing immature eggs from the ovaries , then treating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techni ( que called intracytoplasmic sperm injection , in which sperm is injected directly into an egg , allows some men with low sperm counts to father children . STRENGTHENING WEAK BLADDERS Of the ten million incontinent Americans , about 85 percent are women-and many experience problems for the first time in their 30s , often after childbearing . Fortunately , there 's a variety of treatment options , ranging from inserts , collagen implants , and surgery to strengthen the weakened muscles . Avoiding alcohol and caffeine , and exercising the pelvic muscles have also proven to be effective . HEALING BABIES BEFORE THEY 'RE BORN Today , doctors can safely perform surgery in the womb , and cure fetuses of breathing and blood disorders . This usually involves repairing a hole in the diaphragm , or giving transfusions to correct a blood incompatibility between mother and baby or , in some cases , anemia due to infection . In the latest advance , at least one fetus with an inherited immune-system deficiency received a successful bone-marrow transfusion , in which healthy white cells are delivered into the bloodstream to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also surviving the hazards of premature birth , thanks to antilabor drugs , which can delay delivery by 48 hours . Another big improvement : Pregnant women with AIDS now receive antiviral medications that reduce the risk of infecting their babies by more than half . <p>
