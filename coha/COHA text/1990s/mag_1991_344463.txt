America 's space program has spent billions of dollars and years of effort to produce detailed studies of the clouds of Venus and the craters of Mars . But in the future , NASA 's researchers will need to pay closer attention to their home planet . As the earth 's air , land and seas become ever more threatened by human overpopulation and industrial pollution , measuring the extent of the damage has become one of the most urgent missions of science . <P> This week the space shuttle Discovery is scheduled to deploy the first satellite in the Mission to Planet Earth , an ambitious , long-range program to monitor the planet 's pulse . This particular satellite carries four instruments to gather information about the atmosphere 's vital ozone layer . The most important goal is to measure how badly this fragile band , which protects the earth from the harmful ultraviolet rays in sunlight , is being depleted by the industrial chemicals known as CFCs . <P> Much more is on the drawing boards . During the next 15 years , NASA hopes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containing dozens of instruments for the Earth Observing System ( EOS ) , the centerpiece of Mission to Planet Earth . They will study the impact of such forces as global warming , deforestation and desertification . NASA will also use satellites from other nations and ground monitors to develop a baseline of information against which global change can be measured . <P> Despite its importance , the mission has not escaped criticism . When it was unveiled , detractors complained that , like the controversial space station Freedom , it could turn into a huge , unmanageable boondoggle . " NASA is obsessed with giantism , " contends Robert Park , director of the Washington office of the American Physical Society . " They want to accomplish good , solid environmental science , " he says , but have proposed to do it with complex , untested hardware . The mammoth price tag is also a concern . Richard Darman , head of the Office of Management and Budget , reportedly quipped , " I did n't know we needed a $30 billion thermometer . " <P> NASA 's plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for two large space platforms that would wind up holding the majority of the earth-sensing equipment . These could not be launched before the end of the decade . Scientists objected that locking many of the instruments aboard just two craft would make the program inflexible . If new discoveries were made during the mission , how could the platforms be redesigned to accommodate unplanned research ? Moreover , a Hubble-like glitch or catastrophic accident could wipe out a major portion of the project . Says Tom Donahue , a University of Michigan professor of planetary science : " NASA did n't seem to realize that it was putting too many eggs into one basket . " <P> Another question is how to gather , store , translate and distribute the raw data developed during the project . NASA critics contend that the agency now has reams of information from space missions that no one ever examines , and the Earth Observing System could require major new storage facilities consuming about 60% of the mission 's budget . " Creating a library is a huge task in itself , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the library is to be built .
