<p> Nathaniel Blandon has two young sons , and so a pre-Christmas Saturday morning finds him in a predictable place : in front of a shelf of toy guns . <p> " Try Me ! Pull Trigger ! " pleads one box at the Langley Park Toys " R " Us . " Survivor Shot . When you 're hit  --  you feel it , " promises another . There are Uzis , rifles , assorted pistols . There are Desert Shield Seven Piece Combat Sets and Official Police Play Equipment Enforcement Sets . Bright and plastic , they are for many parents the physical embodiment of a painful dilemma . <p> " It 's impossible to get away from it . Guns are a part of the life now , " Blandon is saying with the resignation of a man describing something utterly beyond his control  --  the weather , or the passage of time . <p> Guns are , indeed , a part of life in a way they never were before . Even though the question of whether to let children play with toy guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has taken on a grisly new relevance as real weapons have shot their way into more and more lives . <p> The Center to Prevent Handgun Violence , an advocacy group , claims that every day 10 children in the United States die after being shot by handguns . Kids carry weapons into schools . In certain Washington neighborhoods , children are no longer surprised to see bodies bleeding in the streets , and even those not directly faced with guns and death see the prevailing mayhem every day on the news . <p> Blandon will probably buy a play weapon or two this season . Others will resist their kids ' yearnings . Either way , it most likely will be a decision they make without much discussion , for the debate over toy guns has about it the air of anachronism . Like the idea of raising TV-free children , it seems a remnant of the ' 60s , born of the belief that we could engineer a generation of pure little pacifists  --  the true flower children . <p> Times changed . The cowboy and his trusty .45s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't that boys were being allowed to play with toy guns , but that girls were n't . People started to like the military again . Butaround Washington , the gun has recently become a symbol of a new kind of fear and danger . Mention toy guns to parents and what they talk about is not a small piece of plastic with a trigger but the violence that fills television screens , newspapers and their childrens ' lives . <p> Broderick Johnson , president of the volunteer mentor organization Concerned Black Men Inc. , has a son who is almost 7 . The boy likes guns . " If he does n't get one , he 'll do like most little boys do  --  he 'll make up one . You wonder , particularly with a black male child , how do you react to those kind of situations . When I go to a store for Christmas shopping , I do n't buy him toy guns , but it 's not clear to me that makes any difference . " <p> That feeling of futility comes from the knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the house , guns are everywhere . Johnson fears for his son 's safety in school , worries classmates may have weapons , knows that if his boy does get his hands on a toy he runs the risk of police making a mistake and seeing him as an actual danger  --  a child with a gun . <p> " What is also obvious is that for many black male children , a toy gun is not their toy , " says Johnson . " Their toy is a real gun . That 's part of the reservoir of toys they have . " <p> Given the statistics about actual gun use , the psychological effect of toys may seem insignificant , but adults working with kids in anti-violence programs say they feel that the toys undermine their message . <p> " Whenever I go into a neighborhood store and there are toy guns on display for sale , I question the proprietor of the store and say , ' Why ? ' because the only thing a child can do with a toy gun is point it at someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph Carter , principal of Draper Elementary School in Southeast Washington . <p> " Personally , I do n't think it 's healthy , because it perpetuates the violence that already exists in the environments these kids are living in , " says Brenda Richardson , executive director of the Anacostia/Congress Heights Partnership for the Prevention of Homelessness . <p> But the fact that real guns are omnipresent actually encourages some parents to let their kids play with the toy versions . Better to talk about guns and learn about their dangers , they say , than pretend they do not exist . " It just reinforces the need to teach them caution , " says Blandon . " You do n't go out and shoot at a person , we tell them . " <p> And he tells his children about consequences , about what happens when a gun is fired . <p> " It 's like cartoons . You tell them they 're not real ; when someone falls off a cliff and it 's 10 miles high , they are going to die . " <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and are not greatly concerned about how such activities will affect the next generation . " I 'm deferring to my wife , " says toy shopper Ward Pettis  --  so there will probably not be toy guns in his two daughters ' lives . " I grew up playing with guns . I played a lot of war games , " he says , smiling self-consciously , " and I 'm not necessarily a warlike person . " <p> University of Maryland student Larry Rowland also played with toy guns when he was a child growing up in St. Mary 's County , and as he got older he says he learned to fire real guns and went hunting with his father , who collected antique firearms . " I think it is n't a problem to be responsible , even with a toy gun . We were taught someone could see it as real , " he says . " The kids who live in the city , I think they 're not taught to be responsible with guns . When I say kids , I mean teenagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns has focused on cases in which toys were believed to be real and were met with police fire . In 1988 a University of the District of Columbia student was killed after waving and pointing a toy gun in front of police , and several months later a man was killed after pointing a BB gun at an off-duty D.C. police officer . Incidents in which children playing with toy guns were killed led Los Angeles and San Francisco to ban the sale of realistic toy guns . That same year Congress passed legislation requiring that toy guns be marked with an orange tip to prevent confusion , but it exempted BB guns , collector replicas and toys modeled on guns manufactured before 1898 . <p> Despite the regulations , however , parents still worry about the guns that are for sale now . In the crisis of the moment , will police realize a pre-1898 model is just that ? According to the Commerce Department 's Office of Consumer Affairs , 15 percent of robberies involve imitation firearms , and in the past five years police have threatened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toy gun was real . <p> And even if children come to no physical harm , is the boundary between the " bang-bang-you're-dead " fantasy and the reality of death on the streets blurring ? <p> " We sell these things on TV to kids when the news is filled with kids killing kids , " says Peggy Charren , president of Action for Children 's Television . " When the company Hasbro dreams up a toy that not only enables you to play shooting games with your friend , but also enables you to feel you 've been shot , we 've taken imagination to a very strange place . " <p> But Charren still remembers the day her " very delightful , peaceful , female child " had oral surgery , and she told the 5-year-old she could have any toy she wanted . After repeatedly hearing her mother say no to her requests for a gun , that was , of course , just what she wanted . All the nos , Charren now thinks , fueled the little girl 's desire . <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . <p> Some parents say they give their children guns but insist that they not point them at other people . This rule , of course , is made to be broken , but Tim Wiens , a father of two small boys , understands that such positions have a greater meaning beyond the actual prohibition . <p> Wiens , a Mennonite and a pacifist , says he told his boys that they can not play with guns in their house . When they are with friends they are free to play with whatever toys they like . <p> " I think the most important thing is for us to convey these values to our children , " he says . " I grew up Mennonite , and I wanted a gun and finally my mom gave in . We got water pistols . I think it 's not so important where you draw the line but that they know your values ... that parents make some attempt to convey some sense of the value of human life . "
