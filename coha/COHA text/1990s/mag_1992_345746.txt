With his stocky build , thick neck and gravelly voice , Salvatore Gravano lives up to his nickname , " Sammy the Bull . " But as he said on the witness stand last week , his enemies are more likely to start calling him by a new moniker , " Sammy the Rat . " In five days of often chilling testimony , the former Gambino family underboss calmly described the secret inner workings and rituals of La Cosa Nostra and provided gory details of the 19 killings he admitted taking part in . Most of all , he tried to hammer nails into the legal coffin of John Gotti , the head of the Gambino crime family , who is on trial in Brooklyn for racketeering , gambling , tax fraud and murder . Known as the Teflon Don because of his acquittals in three previous trials , Gotti may find that his luck has finally run out . <P> Gravano , 46 , was originally supposed to stand trial along with Gotti and Gambino lieutenant Frank ( Frankie Locs ) Locascio . But last fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ link him to several killings , Gravano struck a deal with the feds . In return for a maximum 20-year sentence , which he will probably serve in a high-security witness-protection cellblock , Gravano agreed to testify in Gotti 's trial and others to come . He thus became one of the highest-ranking mafiosi ever to turn state 's evidence and perhaps the most important gangland informant since Mob soldier Joseph Valachi turned on his Genovese bosses in 1963 . Prosecutors hope Gravano 's testimony , along with that of other witnesses , will help get the don out of his trademark double-breasted suits and into a prison uniform for the rest of his days . <P> A onetime boxer and lifelong hoodlum who dropped out of school at 16 , Gravano had plenty to say about the workings of the Gambino family . Until their arrest in December 1990 , Gravano was the don 's right hand and heir apparent . On FBI surveillance tapes , Gotti was frequently heard speaking of his love for Sammy and once told his men , " Soon as anything happens to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boss . " As the man who controlled the Gambino business interests in the New York City construction trade , Gravano claimed to have passed along to Gotti as much as $100,000 a month in kickbacks and other illegal payments . Gravano said other Gambino captains made similar " turn-ins " from the industries they had muscled in on  --  including private trash collecting , the docks and the garment trade  --  as well as $3,000 cash tributes to Gotti on Christmas and his birthday .
