<p> " FOUR DAYS IN SEPTEMBER , " a Brazilian thriller about Marxist insurgents who kidnapped the American ambassador here in 1969 , has been waiting almost two decades for history to catch up with its sense of ambiguity . <p> The makers of the film , Lucy Barreto and her son , Bruno Barreto , who is best known as the director of " Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands " ( 1978 ) , had wanted to film this politically charged story after reading only part of a manuscript written in the late 1970 's by Fernando Gabeira , a journalist who had taken part in the abduction of the ambassador , Charles Burke Elbrick ( portrayed in the film by Alan Arkin ) . The movie , which opens in the United States on Friday , was produced by Ms. Barreto and directed by Mr. Barreto . <p> The kidnapping occurred during the darkest period of Brazil 's dictatorship . That era began with a military coup against President Joao Goulart in 1964 and a pledge from the generals that a return to democracy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oust the left-leaning President , but by 1969 the military suspended freedom of speech and other basic rights and was rounding up intellectuals and suspected leftists for torture , death and deportation . While the record here was never as monstrous as in neighboring Argentina , where 10,000 suspected leftists were " disappeared , " hundreds of Brazilians vanished in the military 's maw . Brazil 's military , once it tasted absolute power , was loath to give it up ; it maintained its grip for 21 years through a half-dozen uniformed heads of state . <p> By 1983 , when the first version of a script for " Four Days in September " was completed , the military was trying to stretch its days in office by relaxing some restrictions on civil freedoms . But the anger among intellectuals at the dictatorship 's reign of torture and oppression was still fresh , making objectivity impossible , Ms. Barreto said . The script that emerged  --  the first of six  --  painted the kidnappers as heroes and the members of the regime as villains . <p> " The dictatorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all Brazilians , " she said . " I thought the script was too radical . There was no humanism . " It also diverged widely from the evolving views of Mr. Gabeira , who is now a federal deputy after undergoing a decade of jail , torture and exile partly spent in Cuba and Eastern Europe . Mr. Gabeira 's 1979 book , " O Que E Isso , Companheiro ? " ( " What 's This All About , Comrade ? " ) , expressed grave doubts about a Marxist revolution and the alternative dictatorship it would produce . <p> The movie , which avoids passing moral judgment on either the kidnappers or the American-backed dictatorship , focuses instead on the psychological repercussions of real-life events . " My goal was not to teach a history class , but to get the audience emotionally motivated to know about what happened , " said the director , Mr. Barreto , in a telephone interview from his home in New York , where he lives with his wife , the actress Amy Irving . " And if they really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they can go and buy the books to learn more about that period . " <p> The abduction on Sept. 4 , 1969 , was the most spectacular action of the leftist groups , which until then had largely confined their revolutionary activities to scrawling slogans on public walls , publishing underground pamphlets and robbing banks . Mr. Elbrick was held for four days in a house in the hilly neighborhood of Santa Teresa until the military government agreed to release 15 imprisoned rebels , who were sent to Mexico . Although they did not torture or assault the ambassador , the abductors threatened to kill him unless their demands were met . <p> Mr. Barreto said he had filmed the kidnapping as a political thriller and character study and tried to avoid turning it into a tale of good guys versus bad guys . In Brazil , however , where it was released last spring under the same title as Mr. Gabeira 's book , " O Que E Isso , Companheiro ? , " the film hit a nerve among veterans of the leftist movements , who felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was actually the film 's trailer , which billed the film as " a true story , " that sparked the sharpest criticism here . If the film was " a true story , " the survivors of the era argued , then it should be measured by its faithfulness not only to the events but also to the spirit of the rebels who challenged the dictatorship and were ultimately destroyed by it . <p> " They were young people who may have chosen the wrong paths , " wrote Helena Salem , a film critic who was once a member of the Maoist Chinese Faction , one of the leftist groups active in Brazil at the time , " but they were generous , indignant , some of the most brilliant minds of their generation , suffocated by the dictatorship in their yearning for freedom . It is this generosity , this other truth , that ' O Que E Isso , Companheiro ? ' fails to reveal . " <p> A similar complaint was voiced by Apolonio de Carvalho , a former member of the Communist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who were exiled to Algeria in 1970 . He said the film failed to capture the " love and justice of the world that Gabeira and his friends belonged to " and made the Ambassador 's kidnapping , which he described as " an armed protest against the military dictatorship , " into something vulgar . <p> Mr. Barreto rejected that criticism . " The irony of all ironies is that had this film been made by a Hollywood studio , any one , they would have offered it to either Oliver Stone or Costa-Gavras , the usual suspects , " Mr. Barreto said . " It would have been a very black and white film , showing the dictatorship as monsters . Ironically , if it had been made by Hollywood , the Brazilian left would have liked it more . " <p> If , in Mr. Barreto 's film , a torturer for military intelligence appears to have more credibility than the students and revolutionaries working to topple the dictatorship , it is no accident . While the violence and disappearances carried out by the myriad secret services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been worse had they prevailed . <p> " I think the military , the dictatorship , at some point they make sense when the secret agent says , ' When they get into power , it would n't be just torture , it would be executions , ' " Mr. Barreto said . " That 's true . We 've seen it ; it 's fact . " <p> Mr. Gabeira himself acknowledged in an interview at a cafe in Rio de Janeiro that his group had " used democracy , but we thought of Communism . " At the time of the kidnapping , Mr. Gabeira worked at the daily Jornal do Brasil while secretly publishing an underground newspaper . Only about 60 people were involved in the armed struggle against the dictatorship , he said , and most did not understand what Communism would mean in Brazil . <p> IN THE MOVIE , Mr. Gabeira 's role is amplified . He is portrayed as the one who comes up with the idea of kidnapping the American Ambassador and as the one who writes a message read on television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabeira said , he learned about the kidnapping only a few days before it occurred , and the Ambassador was held in the house he rented because it was considered the safest , most isolated location . <p> According to Mr. Gabeira , Elbrick , who died in 1983 , held no grudge against his kidnappers . In a key scene , the kidnappers conduct a " trial " of the Ambassador , who says that he does not believe the United States Government benefited from relations with nondemocratic regimes . Mr. Gabeira , who served as the group 's interpreter , maintained that the Ambassador had held fast to his principles while finding common ground with his abductors . <p> When the kidnappers abandoned the house , they left behind a recording of Elbrick 's testimony . The tape alienated both the Brazilian military , which had released prisoners so that Elbrick would be freed unharmed , and the United States Government , whose policy he criticized . ( Mr. Barreto said that for dramatic reasons he had chosen not to show the tape being left behind or discovered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left Brazil shortly after he was released and retired from the Foreign Service not long after that . The impression left is that it was the kidnapping , not the repercussions when his views became known , that had shattered a successful man 's life . <p> Elbrick 's daughter , Valerie , an arts administrator in Washington who has worked in the film industry , has seen the movie and indicated she liked it . Elbrick himself once gave an interview to the Globo television network in Brazil advocating amnesty for his kidnappers . " He was very sympathetic toward us , " Mr. Gabeira said . <p> But in Washington , the crime is not forgotten . Mr. Gabeira , who long ago lowered the red flag in favor of neo-liberal solutions of the kind espoused by Washington and the World Bank , is still persona non grata in the United States . Over the years he has tried and failed three times to obtain a visa to visit the United States . Miramax Films has been working to help secure a visa for Mr. Gabeira so that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outgoing Ambassador to Brazil , Melvyn Levitsky , tells anybody who asks that Fernando Gabeira , whatever his stripes , will never get a visa to enter the United States . <p> " As an immigrant , I think this is the land of redemption , " Mr. Barreto said . " But there 's a double standard that 's sort of weird : you believe in redemption , but you do n't believe that it can happen with someone outside of America .
