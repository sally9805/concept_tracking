<p> For Denver software company J.D Edwards , the so-called Y2K bug bit seven months early . <p> After robust growth for several years running , J.D. Edwards ' revenues and earnings skidded beginning in May . <p> It was a Year 2000 thing . <p> Customers clamped down on technology expenditures . Their budgets were maxed out getting ready for the computer glitch called Y2K . They did n't want to mess with new software and hardware as Dec. 31 drew ever closer . The market was in lockdown mode . <p> ' We would have loved to have grown 30 or 40 percent like we have in past years but that was not the market in 1999 , ' said Mark Peterson , J.D. Edwards ' director of product strategies . ' It certainly has been affecting us . ' <p> As the year comes to an end , J.D. Edwards and a number of other Colorado technology vendors look forward with glee to Y2K 's passing . It 's a new beginning , bringing replenished budgets and renewed interest in cutting-edge products . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and energy making sure their computer systems know that next year is 2000 and not 1900 . Analysts and technology vendors predict they will again spend big bucks on hardware , software and technology consulting services . <p> They will need to beef up their technology to stay afloat in the new Internet economy and the world of electronic business . Pent-up demand could send the floodgates flying . <p> ' The outlook that we have is strong , ' said Sandra Rogers , research manager at International Data Corp . in Framingham , Mass. , a research firm that has tracked Y2K 's impact on technology spending . ' I think there has been a postponement of projects that may have taken place that will be front-burnered going forward . ' <p> Local and national companies have cited Y2K while explaining poor performance this year . Storage Technology Corp. , the data storage company based in Louisville , said in October that customers were putting off orders for storage devices until next year . <p> IBM , the computer giant based in Armonk , N.Y. , shared a similar tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buyers of IBM 's network and database servers are postponing purchases until after the start of the new year , when concerns over year-2000 computer bugs are fully resolved . <p> ' Your largest companies in America , and government as well , pretty much locked down their operations starting mid-year , telling their information technology department , ' Do not buy any new software . Do not introduce anything new into the environment , ' ' said Scott Lutz , senior vice president of sales and operations for RSA Companies , a privately held information technology solutions company in Arapahoe County . ' Essentially , they stopped purchasing things . Software , computers and everything . ' <p> Spending on technology dropped off as companies got closer to their Y2K compliance deadline , Rogers said . It resumed at more-normal levels after individual companies were confident they were ready for Y2K , she said . <p> The impact was different depending on the customer . In the banking industry hardware investments were postponed or reduced , International Data Corp. , or IDC , found . Financial services companies postponed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut back on applications . <p> Timing is everything <p> FRx Software Corp. , a private vendor of financial reporting software , has one customer that ca n't place a six-figure order before Dec. 31 , partly because of Y2K-related cost overruns , said Chris Giblin , vice president of enterprise sales for the Denver Tech Center company . The order should come through in early January , but Giblin would rather get the order on his books in 1999 . <p> ' They hands-down told us we will not get it in December no matter what unnatural acts we would do to get it in , ' Giblin said . ' That 's a byproduct of Y2K . I 'm sure sales managers across the country are sharing in that dilemma . ' <p> On a positive note , some customers ordered products early in the year because they knew that later purchases would be precluded by Y2K testing . One financial institution in New York pushed a ' multiple six-figure ' order through early last summer because products purchased after August could n't be running until February , Giblin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the decision to get our product because it 's very easy to install and not very intrusive , ' Giblin said . ' Because of that , we 've been able to dodge the bullet of the clampdowns . It has n't affected us as much as large-system providers . ' <p> But it has had some impact . After increasing revenues by close to 100 percent annually since being founded in 1994 , FRx will slow by about half that rate in 1999 , a drop attributed to Y2K , Giblin said . FRx wo n't know the full impact of Y2K 's dampening affect until its selling partners close their books on Dec. 31 , Giblin said . <p> ' They are saying business is slow , ' Giblin said . <p> J.D. Edwards proves the point . <p> Its fourth-quarter revenue , for the period ending Oct. 31 , was $ 257.6 million , compared with $ 307.7 million in 1998 . Its third-quarter revenue drop off was not as steep : $ 232.1 million in 1999 , compared with $ 239.6 million in 1998 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3.8 million in the fourth quarter of 1999 , compared with $ 37.1 million in 1998 . In the third quarter of 1999 , it lost $ 7.2 million , not including acquisition costs , compared with $ 18.1 million in net profits in 1998 . <p> J.D. Edwards ' software-license revenue for the 12 months ending Oct. 31 was $ 312.8 million , off from $ 386.1 million for the same period the year before . <p> Market expected to improve <p> Without making specific projections , J.D. Edwards ' Peterson said that the technology market should improve dramatically in 2000 . <p> ' I think there 's going to be a tremendous opportunity , ' he said . ' I think that certainly once the Year 2K crisis has passed , people will have their budgets refreshed . They will be out there looking for technology to make themselves more competitive . ' <p> Internet-related software and development tools were least hit by Y2K-related spending cutbacks , IDC found . Perhaps that 's because companies view having an Internet presence as a must-have in an economy evolving more toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than other technologies , Rogers said . <p> Even companies that have performed fairly well in 1999 say they could have done better if not for Y2K 's impact . <p> Growing e-business <p> Ciber Inc. , the Arapahoe County information technology consulting company , reported $ 187 million in revenues for the first quarter ending Sept. 30 , a 13 percent increase over the previous year . Net income was $ 10.3 million , down from $ 11.1 million in the same quarter in 1998 . <p> In explaining its performance , the company cited an ' industry wide effect of reduced spending on information technology services ' by customers who postponed new purchases until next year . <p> Ciber 's clients have indicated that they will know their project priorities for 2000 by February , when the company is expecting heavy demand for new projects , particularly involving e-business , said Joe Mancuso , president of Ciber 's custom-solutions group . <p> ' We also feel there will be some clients that do have some Y2K issues that they are going to fix and are going to need some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Not every technology company was hurt by Y2K specifically . <p> New Era of Networks , or Neon , which helps customers integrate computer systems , did n't see the slowdown that others felt . Its revenues grew steadily to record levels throughout the year , but not as high as the company had hoped . That in addition to acquisition costs and several other market factors caused its profit to slip to losses in the third and fourth quarters of 1999 . <p> But Y2K was not really a factor , said Mike Donaldson , Neon 's senior vice president of worldwide marketing . <p> ' We tend to be part of the Y2K solution in that when people would put in new software that was Y2K compliant and they would need to integrate it with existing software , that 's what we do , ' Donaldson said . ' Y2K slowed down parts of the market and sped up parts of the market . ' <p> Whether 1999 treated technology vendors well or badly , most agree that 2000 will be a big improvement . <p> ' Moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lockdown , ' said Loren Cook , vice president of technology and services for RSA Companies . ' The spending that was n't allowed before can happen . ' @p#
