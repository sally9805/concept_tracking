<p> " An eerie type of chaos can lurk just behind a facade of order  --  and yet , deep inside the chaos lurks an even eerier type of order . " <p>  --  Cognitive theorist Douglas Hofstadter <p> CINCINNATI  --  John Stamstad is not a physicist , but he has a deep , personal understanding of chaos theory . <p> Stamstad is perhaps the world 's greatest ultra-endurance athlete . His feats of physical prowess are legendary in the tightknit world of men and women who run or pedal for days or weeks at a time . <p> He has been poked and probed by astounded physiologists and biologists . Their numbers reveal the power of his sinewy , 5-9 , 138-pound body but can not plumb the depth of his intellectual strength . And it is that mental power that leaves rivals shaken and shivering in fetal curls , crushed by the pain he surfs like a cerebral wave . <p> While others see pain as a brutish obstacle , Stamstad sees it as the threads of order in the roaring chaos of racing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , sunning himself on the deck of his wooden frame house high on a hill overlooking this river city . " It took me a long time to feel that pain is good . A few years ago I figured out that 's what these races are all about . <p> " I made a conscious switch to make pain a positive goal . And if that 's what I was after , then I had to make my races as hard as possible . " <p> To that end , he has succeeded . Some career highlights : <p>  --  At the Wilderness 101 ultra-marathon mountain bike race in 1993 , Stamstad fell hard while leading . Sharp , sizzling pain shot through his shoulder . A friend told him it was " only " a separated shoulder and he should continue to ride . Stamstad could n't see his broken collarbone pushing against the skin . He finished the remaining 80 miles and won easily . " During the 14-hour drive home , I was so scared the bone would just pop up through my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he began the 3,000-mile Trans-Australia Bicycle Challenge . After 1,500 miles of vertabrae-bashing dirt trails , only a handful of riders remained and race support had collapsed . Stamstad just pedaled harder and rode on to what had been the finish line . <p>  --  As a competitor in the 1996 Eco-Challenge multisport 300-mile adventure race in British Columbia , Stamstad 's Habitat for Humanity team made a serious navigational error , bushwacking seven hours in the wrong direction from the next resupply point . " I spent the next 20 hours chopping through the dense underbrush with only a pack of GU ( a gel food supplement ) and a package of dry soup , " he recalls . " I was convinced it was impossible , but we did it . It is amazing what you can do when you absolutely have to . " <p>  --  Racing against other bikers , cross-country skiers and snowshoers in last year 's 170-mile Iditasport in Alaska , Stamstad trailed skier Jim Jager for most of the contest . With 50 miles left in the race , Jager had a two-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rigors of traveling through thigh-deep snowdrifts and subzero temperatures , Stamstad was summoning his powers of concentration . He passed Jager with 30 miles remaining , a move that crushed the skier 's spirit . Jager spent more than an hour curled up in a sleeping bag before rejoining the race . " It was pretty grim , " Jager told the Anchorage Daily News . " I was just a wobble . My worst nightmare was that another mountain biker was going to go rolling by . " Stamstad claimed the fourth of his five Iditasport championships . <p> Saturday , Stamstad , 31 , will mount his titanium-framed Trebron mountain bike in the 24 Hours of Moab endurance race in Utah , one in a series of around-the-clock events that have become popular with adventure sports fans eager to see the spectacle of round-the-clock suffering . <p> A solo effort <p> Pain has gone mainstream : Newsweek is title sponsor of the series . Although Stamstad is entered in the men 's solo class , he 's a sponsored member of Team Chevy Trucks ZR2 Trebron . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy products and Rockport shoes among his endorsements . <p> The solo category exists because of Stamstad 's determination to enter the 1996 24 Hours of Canaan ( W.Va ) race . Organizers insisted the race was a team relay , so he signed up as Team Ritchey . The members : John Stamstad , J. Robert Stamstad , J.R . Stamstad and John Robert Stamstad . <p> One rotation of the Earth and 143 miles later , the one and only John Stamstad finished the race , not in victory , but ahead of more than half of the four-person teams . <p> He is deeply bothered by the notion that his accomplishments are the work of a fanatic with weird obsessions . <p> " From afar , a lot of the things I do appear that way , " Stamstad says , his shoulder-length , sunset-gold hair framing his wind-burned and bearded face . " I try to do things that maximize myself as a person , push me to my limits so I can glimpse a different aspect of myself . Cycling is just my means of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that at all . I 'm just a normal guy . " <p> A glance around his cluttered office-shop in the Clifton Heights section of Cincinnati reveals an analytical mind at work in an athlete 's body . His IBM laptop computer shares table space with bicycle derailleurs and plastic bags of nutritional supplements . Wal-Mart metal bookshelves sag with cleated racing shoes , loose-leaf binders and a gaggle of Microsoft computer guides . At eye level : The Reader 's Digest New Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual , Bicycle Road Racing and Chaos , Making a New Science by James Gleick . <p> In the room are four scales : two small ones for apportioning his energy concoctions , one for his bike ( 23 pounds ) and one for his body ( three pounds over race weight ) . <p> Stamstad the calculator has found a way to measure his pain . He trains with a bike-mounted heart-rate monitor that gives his pain a name and a number . His resting heart rate , taken seconds after awakening , is 38 beats a minute  --  about 20 beats slower than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximum is 196 . Using the monitor as a tachometer , he knows he will redline at about 190 beats and explode at 200 . <p> " As a training goal , I try to see how many minutes I can train at 175 . I do n't have to get emotional about my pain , I can just look down and be pleased that I 'm riding that hard . " <p> Renewed passion <p> Stamstad the husband and father has found a place for emotion . His wife , Karla Korra , gave birth to a son nine months ago . <p> " Eli 's birth was the most powerful moment in my life , " he says , eyes burning with intensity . " I was completely overcome with emotion watching his head come through . <p> " He has ignited my zest for life ; he has such a passion for just being alive . At the end of the day , the last thing he wants to do is sleep . He wants to learn and experience everything ! <p> " That 's the way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was born , I thought I would do the teaching , but I 've discovered that I 'm learning so much more from him . " <p> Or as Gleick sums up chaos theory , " Tiny differences in input . . . quickly become overwhelming differences in output . "
