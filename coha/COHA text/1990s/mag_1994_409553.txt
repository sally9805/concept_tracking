Check out the rod selection on the boats around you next time you 're waiting in line at a launching ramp . Clamped on the decks are so many casting , flipping , pitching , cranking , yanking and spinning sticks that you 'd swear someone had clear-cut a graphite forest . But is there ever a single fly rod to be seen ? " I 'm after bass , not a bunch of pint-size panfish , " one fisherman told me . " I do n't have room for toys . " Probe a little deeper , and you 'll get a raft of reasons , some that make sense and some that are adrift in myth and misconception . Many dedicated flyfishermen even stumble when asked why they insist on using a fly rod for bass . " Well , it 's just more fun , " they 're likely to say . But ask them to name one practical task a fly rod will perform better than casting or spinning tackle , and few can answer . Let 's be honest . The purely pragmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better off using casting or spinning tackle most of the time . For example , a fly rod is a poor tool for probing deep summer structure even with the most modern , fast-sinking fly lines . Baitcasting and spinning tackle are almost invariably superior for bass anytime you 're fishing more than a few feet deep , especially on big , open water . It 's a chore to flycast into the wind all day , and there are limits to the maximum size and weight of fly or bug even the most powerful fatline sticks will handle . But hold on a minute . If fly rods are so impractical , what explains the incredible boom in trout and saltwater flyfishing in recent years ? And why are so many serious bass fishermen , the guys on the leading edge , also adding fly rods to their arsenal ? The truth is , there are some tasks a fly rod can perform better than any other tackle . Let 's take a closer look at ways a fly rod can give bass fishermen  --  perhaps even tournament pros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only tool that can deliver a small , fly-weight lure on really strong line . Ultralight spinning tackle ca n't even do that . Yet , the myth lingers that flyfishing demands light leaders . Who says ? Sure , light leaders are sometimes necessary , but your leader and tippet can be as heavy as need be . If you 're flyfishing around dense weeds , lily pads or tangled timber , there 's no reason why you ca n't use a monofilament tippet that tests 20 , 30 or even 40 pounds to haul those lunkers out of cover . Indeed , stronger , stiffer leaders will turn over big , heavy flies better than light leaders , and because bass are seldom leader-shy , why take chances ? Even in open water , heavier tippets will let you land fish more quickly so that you can release them with a better chance of survival . For bass , I normally use a 10-foot leader tapered to 12 to 15-pound test , but I 'll go to heavier tippets when I need them . You might be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly and a stout leader can work miracles on bass that might otherwise go uncaught . Last summer on Florida 's vast Lake Okeechobee , following the 27th Annual Harold DeTar Flyfishing Tournament , guide Chris Rivers and I decided to do a little experimenting . The weather was so hot that bass fishing had been erratic , but I was curious to see if I could wake up the fish with bigger casting lures and plastic worms . Late that afternoon , Rivers located bass chasing small minnows along the edge of one of Okeechobee 's famed horizon-to-horizon beds of waterlilies . I had no luck at all with buzzbaits or other big lures , but Rivers borrowed one of my fly rods and caught nice bass on nearly every cast . It did n't take me long to grab another fly rod and join the fun . The pads were far too thick and tough for ultralight spinning tackle , but with 20-pound-test tippets we could cast our minnowlike poppers fearlessly and drag fish into open water . It was particularly nice to have those heavier tippets because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than eight pounds in the same spot a week earlier . SPLAT , THEY 'RE OUTTA HERE How do you handle clear , calm water and bass that spook like dirt-road lizards when your standard casting or spinning lure hits the water with the subtleness of a cinder block ? If you 've got a fly rod on board , it will delicately deliver small , nearly weightless enticements . By aiming your cast above the water 's surface , your fly line will uncurl in midair and the bug or fly will drop to the surface like a feather ( which , in many cases , it is ) . Of course , you could use ultralight spinning tackle and small , light lures , and that 's what many bass fishermen choose . And yet , a modern graphite fly rod in the hands of a skilled angler can actually cast farther and more accurately than most ultralight spinning outfits . PINPOINT ACCURACY There are times when it 's vital to deliver a lure to a small target cast after cast . Some highly skilled baitcasters can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even a flycaster with moderate skills can routinely cast a bug or fly 70 feet or more and place it within inches of a target . Such accuracy is essential when probing small pockets in emergent weed beds , lily pads or similar cover . TWO-TIMING With flyfishing gear , you can easily fish two flies at the same time  --  one on top and another running a couple of feet beneath the surface . It 's not practical with casting or spinning tackle , but a fly rod can handle this chore easily . I frequently fish two flies for bass  --  panfish and trout , too  --  and usually choose a floating bug trailed by a sinking pattern . You can also combine two entirely different sinking flies fished in tandem  --  a leech chased by a minnow , for example . It 's a deadly tactic with lots of possible combinations , and you 'll occasionally catch two bass at the same time . Talk about a wild ride ! My favorite way to rig tandem flies is to knot the first fly or bug to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monofilament in the eye of the same fly . This trailing tippet can vary in length , but I rarely need more than 15 to 20 inches . The second fly  --  usually a sinking pattern  --  is then tied to the end of the trailing tippet . This method is less cumbersome and retains higher knot strength than the more common technique of tying the first fly on a three or four-inch dropper off a leader knot Rig your flies so that the trailing pattern , on the end of the tippet , is slightly heavier or less wind-resistant than the forward fly . SCENT OF A FLY Many bass fishermen use special scents and attractants , but even the stickiest solutions do n't adhere well to metal , hard-plastic or even softplastic lures . That 's not true of most bugs and flies . Soak a deer-hair bug , fuzzy nymph or streamer in bass attractant allowing it to soak into the material , and it will exude the enticing odor of food or pheromones for an extended time . It 's another edge flyfishing can give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spinning lures offer superb imitations of many foods that bass like , but have you seen the array of modern flies lately ? Many look real enough to straighten pigtails at any grammar school show-and-tell , and a lot of these flyfishing patterns fill gaps that simply ca n't be duplicated in metal or plastic . Crayfish , minnows , crabs , nymphs , dragonflies , shrimp , frogs , leeches  --  you name it and some fly tier has come up with an amazingly lifelike imitation . Often , one of these bugs or flies will work better and can be controlled with more finesse than a casting or spinning lure , but only if you have the correct delivery system . GO TO SCHOOL So a fly rod is no good on big deep lakes , right ? Actually , it 's the nearly ideal tool for bass in open water . On large impoundments , when bass are chasing bait on the surface and when that bait is small threadfin shad or golden shiners  --  and that 's often the case  --  a fly rod can deliver a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long casts are often necessary , but a modern graphite fly rod can handle the task . On big lakes near my home in North Carolina , bass boats gather in armadas to wait for schooling bass to chase bait on the surface . Most of these fish are small , but some schools hold bass averaging three pounds or more . Casting or spinning tackle does n't always work because the bass are easily spooked or are reluctant to take large lures . Last summer , I joined a handful of flyfishermen who were convinced that fly patterns such as thin balsa skipping bugs or Clouser Minnows dressed to imitate the threadfins would work . We stalked those schoolies in bass boats and smoked them while anglers with heavier tackle looked on in envious astonishment . By now , you could be thinking that there may be room for a fly rod in your bass boat after all . The opportunities for school bass might be reason enough , yet remember that a fly rod is at its best in relatively shallow water where there are weed beds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar cover . Farm ponds , small lakes and many rivers are prime spots , yet lots of large lakes also have small-water characteristics . Certainly that 's true of Okeechobee . Even big , deep reservoirs have sheltered coves , weedy flats and shorelines made to order for flyfishing . CHOOSING YOUR WEAPONS Today 's fly rods , lines , reels , leaders , bugs and flies are generally superior to the gear available just a decade ago . For bass , an 8-1/2 to 9-1/2-foot graphite fly rod matched to an 8 or 9-weight fly line and reel will be your best bet , although some anglers find a 6 or 7-weight rod less tiring to cast and more than adequate when fishing smaller bugs and flies on calm days . Many modern fly rods  --  especially some of the more expensive high-tech graphites  --  have fast , progressive actions that are designed for quick , long casts . These rods bend mostly toward the tip when casting and have stiff butts . Such rods work fantastically when distant casts and aerodynamic streamers , such as Clouser Minnows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hauling fish out of cover . However , these stiff rods are not designed to cast big , wind-resistant deer-hair bugs , cork poppers or fluffy eel flies . You can improve the rods ' ability to handle bulky bugs by overlining them  --  using 9 or 10-weight line on an 8-weight rod , for example . Though excellent , these rods are n't cheap . Expect to pay $250 or more . If you 're buying your first fly rod , to be used specifically for bass , you may consider purchasing one designed for the bugs you 'll use often . For that task , you need a slow-action rod , one that flexes powerfully and evenly with an almost lazy stiffness over a much greater part of its length . Fly rods with these characteristics are n't as common as fast-action rods ; however , some very serviceable graphite bass rods are available at prices ranging from $100 to $200 . When looking for a fly reel for bass , remember that you do n't need a precision stainless model with bonefish-stopping drag . Bass get mad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs . Most single-action reels will serve well . However , if you 're like most anglers , your fishing is n't limited to one species . If northern pike , stripers , big trout , salmon or inshore saltwater species are in your future , consider a reel with a disc-type drag . Several inexpensive to moderately priced models are available that can handle big species that sprint . As your fondness of flyfishing grows , these sturdy reels leave room to grow into . If you 're a novice , a few casting lessons with a good instructor will soon have you catching bass you might not have caught otherwise . And should your casting and spinning buddies ask about that fly rod in your bass boat , just tell them it 's for fun . No need to give away all your secrets . MECHANICS Powerful disc-drag reels ( Orvis Battenkill , right ) utilize gears and brake pads to slow fish . Spring-and-pawl reels ( Scientific Angler Systems 1 ) are simpler and less powerful , but they 'll handle all types of bass fishing . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) LAMSON USA LP-3.5 : This five-year-old company has developed smooth , powerful mechanical disc-drag reels at a reasonable price ( $185 ) . CORTLAND LTD GRAPHITE 80 : Made almost entirely of corrosion-proof graphite , the LTD is affordable and light  --  great for reducing the fatigue factor when throwing big hairy bugs on heavy bass-taper lines . Disc drag is a bonus ( $75 ) . SCIENTIFIC ANGLER SYSTEM 1 : If you fish for bass , the System 1 's spring-and-pawl drag is everything you need ( $69.95 ) . Want a little more beef ? Try the System 2 series ( $129 to $149 not shown ) . ORVIS BATTENKILL : A hefty disc drag at a reasonable price ( $105 ) . OTHERS ( not pictured ) : Multiplier reels ( Orvis offers several models ) and the old-style automatics are great for bass fishing because they can quickly take up the excess line lying in a boat when a fish is hooked . Other than that , there are no secrets . From $25 generic models to $400 Fin-Nors , any fly reel will work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( Picture Omitted ) SAGE GRAPHITE III RPLX ( 9-foot , 8-weight ) : Sage rods are known for their fast action , which is n't best for casting slow-traveling hair bugs . But the Sage power will throw a fly line into the next county . Their heavy backbone quickly lets bass know who 's the boss ( $380 ) . FENWICK IRON FEATHER ( 9-foot 9-inch , 8-weight ) : Also has fast action but the unique graphite construction loads exceptionally well with a bass-taper fly line . Extra length keeps heavy flies high above the water ( and your head ) when casting . Tremendous backbone will haul any bass out of heavy cover($359) . LAMIGLAS G1000 ( 9-foot , 8-weight ) : When teamed with a bass-taper line , the G1000 's smooth action makes a great bug rod . Lack of frills keeps the price down ( $129.95 ) . ORVIS RIVERMASTER ( Rocky Mountain version 9-1/2-foot , 8-weight ) : Slow action and reserve power are great for casting bass bugs and bulky streamers . Extra length is great for casting out a canoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictured ) : Penn 's Gold Medal rod has a powerful , medium action , and the G. Loomis GL3 is a good all-around fly rod . Affordable first-time rods include models made by Cortland and St. Croix , most of the mass-produced rods ( Cabela 's for example ) are inexpensive and have slower , bug-slinging actions . If you are new to fly fishing , kits including rod , reel , line , backing , leader and other goodies take away the guesswork . They 're available from most rod makers and cover every range of price . Be sure to practice-cast a rod before buying it . LINES &; LEADERS Choose a good-quality weight-forward floating or bass-taper floating line that matches the weight of your rod . These lines are thicker on the fly end of the taper , providing the weight and power to cast heavy , wind-resistant bass flies . For backing , use 20 to 30-pound braided Dacron . You 'll rarely get into it when bass fishing , but you should use it to fill your reel to keep your fly-line coils larger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much to use . For leaders , you 'll find that stiff monofilament will turn over a fly better than the super-limp stuff . Your leader does n't have to be overly long  --  seven to 10 feet is sufficient . Most of the knotless tapered leaders available are excellent and hassle-free . Tippets should test 10 to 15 pounds . TIP Fly gear is great for skipping small cork poppers under overhanging brush or docks . To do so , overpower your forward cast , using a sidearm motion , and try to let the fly hit hard at a low angle . A short , heavy leader will help . It takes practice , and you may get hung up but your fly will get to where the bass live . THE FLIES When it comes to choosing bugs and flies , start with a few simple deer-hair or cork poppers in various sizes for surface fishing and add some weighted streamers that imitate leeches or baitfish . After you 've fished with these awhile , you 'll have a better idea what to get next . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top ) two Clouser Minnows , marabou leech , two rabbit strip eel flies and Janssen 's Minnows . ( Picture Omitted ) These streamers should be stripped and paused  --  bass will often take weighted fly as it sinks . Experiment with different retrieves . Below are popper and bass bugs . The four on the right side of the photograph , including the top one , are made of cork or balsa , the three on the left are tied with deer hair . To bass , these surface flies are seen as injured baitfish or hapless amphibians . Often , poppers should be fished slowly , enticingly . A gurgle here , a wiggle there , then a long pause . However , when bass are aggressive , a rapid , erratic escape retrieve will often trigger vicious strikes . Flies do n't have to be huge . But they should be too large to interest panfish  --  No. 1 or No. 2 size hooks work well . <p>                    @
