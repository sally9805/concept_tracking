<p> This week , the Cobb Extra takes a preview look at Cobb County 's boys high school basketball teams . <p> Campbell : Spartans look for rebounders <p> If the Spartans can find a way to get their share of rebounds , the coming season could be another good one . Second-year coach Mike Baumgarten worries about the lack of size , but he has some double-figure scoring punch returning in forwards Gary Harden and Chris Howard . It 'll be difficult to replace the court presence of graduated guards Boomer Dunn ( 15.0 ppg ) and Cochise Rocquemore ( 18.4 ) , although Baumgarten sees guard play as a potential strength eventually . <p> Harrison : Hoyas ' defense to be strong <p> First-year varsity coach Jerry Meuschke , who handled the Harrison JV program last winter , must find some scoring punch to replace the top two point-makers of a year ago , Adam Russell ( 16.5 ppg , 10.4 rpg ) and John Cavan ( 11.7 ppg ) . Defense and depth should be the Hoyas ' strengths , but Meuschke is concerned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting . <p> Lassiter : Key Trojans return for ' 94-95 <p> It 's an unusual situation for coach Lawanza Crutcher , who usually cobbles together a competitive team despite heavy graduation losses . He 's got virtually every key player back , including early University of Virginia signee Scott Johnson , who 's grown an inch to 6-10 since last year . Guard/forward Scott Prather and forward Zach Vail are potential all- star candidates - both were solid performers on last year 's 6-AAAA Division A ( tournament ) championship team . <p> Marietta : Devils to be tough again <p> Despite the loss of Wake Forest signee Steven Goolsby ( 29 ppt , 9 rpg ) and center David Robinson ( 15 ppg , 10 rpg ) , the only four-year starters in coach Charlie Hood 's long tenure at Marietta , the Blue Devils still figure to be among 6-AAAA 's top teams once they 're at full strength . Guard Travis Zachery and wings LaBrone Mitchell and Darrell Arvin , members of the school 's playoff-bound football team , will add considerably to a group that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent presence of Goolsby . <p> McEachern : Indians go for state berth <p> Veteran coach Dave Westerfield is concerned about the Indians ' depth , but his front-line group again appears strong , and the senior- dominated team could challenge for its seventh state playoff berth in the past eight years . Post Fred Bonner and guard David Laukka graduated among the starters from the 5-AAAA runnerup squad that edged 6-AAAA champ Pope 58-56 in the state playoffs , but Westerfield sees returnees Carl Johnson , Jamaal Bryant and Yaphet Patterson as potential all-stars from a group with good speed and quickness . Senior forward Andrew Westerfield , the coach 's son , and guard Chris Fletcher are above-average shooters . <p> Mt . Paran : Eagles to be small , young <p> With the tallest starter measuring 6-foot-2 , the Eagles will have a tough time equaling last year 's 21-7 record - best in school history - that produced a 7-A West regular-season and tournament title . Point guard Ben Davidson ( 8 ppg ) moved to Alabama , denting a lineup already missing graduates Chad Simon ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College signee , David deLamare ( 12 ppg , 7 rpg ) and Danny Diaz ( 6 ppg , 5 rpg ) . On a young team , guards Graham Kish and John Rutledge will be counted on heavily for their experience . Still , Mount Paran got off to a good start on Nov. 15 , beating Galloway School 62-44 on the road . <p> North Cobb : Warriors return 3 starters <p> Coach Ken Ross puts it bluntly . " We 're small , and we ca n't shoot , " he says , which suggests that the Warriors are apparently going to have to excel on the defensive end if they 're to improve upon last year 's 6-18 finish . Guard Ben Odell ( 10 ppg ) and forward Skip Shipp ( 10 ppg ) graduated from a team that had trouble scoring , so returning starters Rodney Christian , Don Mundin and Quincy Johnson will have to pick up the slack . <p> Osborne : Cards again small , quick <p> Osborne lost considerable scoring punch when wing Corey Collier ( 19.1 ppg ) and guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firepower returns outside with guard Hakeem Batiste and inside with forward Marcus Larry . How soon they become effective is dependent upon the Osborne football team 's postseason success , since both are key players in that sport . As usual , the Cardinals will be small , depending upon quickness and pressure defense to compensate for a lack of height . <p> Pebblebrook : Team to rely on quickness <p> Scoring leaders Howard Pharr ( 14.9 ppg , 6.7 rpg ) and Dante Bryant ( 11.9 ppg ) graduated , and coach John Morgan will be trying to rebuild with only one returning starter . The Falcons will be small , as they were last year , but Morgan lists quickness and shooting ability as their assets . " We 're strong at the perimeter , but we have unproven post players , so the key will be how well our big people adjust to the varsity level , " he said . <p> South Cobb : Blair returns to lead Eagles <p> With only three seniors , the War Eagles will be inexperienced this winter , and coach Lewis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plus side are the team 's overall athletic ability , the return of veteran point guard Eric Blair , a three-year starter , and better size than the team had a year ago . Morris likes this edition 's chances " if we can all get on the same page defensively . " <p> Sprayberry : Jackets start from scratch <p> All five starters graduated from the 13-13 team that upset state- ranked Marietta in the 6-AAAA tournament last winter . Center Erin Galloway ( 15 ppg , 12 rpg , Georgia State U. signee ) , guard Ray Hallman ( 13 ppg , 4 rpg ) , Seth LaFera ( 12 ppg ) and forward Shawn Gibson ( 15 ppg , 9 rpg ) are gone , leaving coach Bob Barker virtually an entirely new roster . Guard Vince Johnson saw some varsity playing time as a freshman and is the " veteran " on the team . " We need a lot of playing time because most of these kids have n't played in a varsity game , " said Barker . <p> Walker : Wolverines poised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 ppg , 10 rpg ) graduated , but third-year coach Cal Boyd likes the Wolverines ' depth and balance between inside and outside strength . Walker has good overall height , which has its advantages but could cause matchup problems against smaller , quicker teams . Boyd sees point guard Brent Lingerfelt , guard Neal Daniel and post Rob Thompson as potential all-stars in Region 7-A . Daniel is the leading returning scorer . <p> Walton : Raiders could challenge for title <p> The Raiders lost college signees Charlie Mattox ( 17 ppg , 6.3 rpg , Berry College ) and Judson Brown ( 13 ppg , Reinhardt Jr . College ) but have a decent nucleus back , including post Thomas Wideman , an early signee with Clemson University . Depth is a question mark . Still , Walton will be one of Cobb 's taller teams , and if coach Joe Wilson can find a consistent outside shooter to take the pressure off his inside players , the Raiders could make a run at the region title . <p> Wheeler : Rebuilding around Abdur-Rahim <p> Most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Class AAAA title are gone , with one significant exception , wing/forward Shareef Abdur-Rahim , an early signee to the University of California . All-county guard Mike Santos ( 14 ppg ) , forward Duan Dove and guards Torri McCullough , Temu Dixon and Dee Smith are among the graduates , and their collective loss will be felt . Coach Doug Lipscomb hopes to get scoring from Santez Kindred and Dee Weir , two who received considerable playing time last year , plus guards Eric Desmond and D.A . Layne . Six-seven Russ Wheeler , a transfer who averaged 15 points and 10 rebounds for Dalton High ( 14-8 ) as a sophomore , is a good shooter from 15 feet and could take some of the inside pressure off Abdur-Rahim.
