There are hundreds of patterns , but these twelve are the proven producers . // DAY IN AND DAY OUT , East or West , early season or late , hatches or no hatches , mountain stream or spring creek , which patterns catch the most trout ? The 12 fly patterns presented here get my vote . They represent a mix of searching/attractor flies and hatch matchers ; of traditional favorites and newer flies ; of dries , nymphs , and streamers . ( Sorry , no wet flies . They just are n't as widely useful as other types , and in many cases the nymphs on my list can be fished effectively on a down-and-across swing , wet-fly style . ) I 've selected them according to a few simple criteria . Since there are so few of them , the flies must be versatile enough to address a variety of fishing situations . They also have to be durable ; patterns that disintegrate after a trout or two do n't make my fly box . Finally and most important , they must be proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only one dry fly to fish , this is it . The Elk Hair Caddis offers it all-superb flotation , excellent visibility , and good durability . It 's deadly during a caddis hatch , but produces equally well when fished as a searching pattern . Though the fly is ordinarily fished deaddrift , the abundance of hackle allows you to skate or skitter this pattern across the surface , which can trigger some jolting strikes . The bushy , buoyant wing makes it a natural for fast or broken water ; on flatter water , you can trim the hackle flush with the bottom of the body to put the fly right on the surface . You can also trim the wing back to onethird the original length and fish this fly as an emerger pattern . Parachute Adams . The standard Adams is probably the best-known fly in America , but the parachute version will fish circles around the original . The low-floating body shows the fish an unobstructed silhouette , while the white upright wing is highly visible to the angler , even on very small flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darker-colored mayflies , but it also produces during caddis hatches when trout , I believe , take it for an emerger . Above all , it is a superb pattern for searching the water when no fish are showing . This is one of my flies of first resort . Comparadun . The Comparadun is one of the most universally effective fly designs for matching mayfly hatches . Because there is no hackle , the body of this fly rides flush against the water ; it presents a well-defined profile of both body and wing and makes an excellent flat-water pattern . Yet the deer-hair wing gives this fly good buoyancy , and it can hold its own in the rougher stuff . If rising trout refuse this fly , you can trim the wing to a stub and fish the pat tern in the surface film-it makes a highly credible emerger . Royal Wulff . This top attractor pattern is virtually unmatched in snatching trout from heavy currents , broken water , and bouldery pockets . The high-floating design and conspicuous white wings make it easy for both fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as a Western , fast-water fly , but it 's a superb pattern for prospecting Eastern waters , especially smaller mountain streams . And many anglers do n't realize that , in smaller sizes ( say , #18 ) , it can be deadly in flat , glassy water . Stimulator . This relatively recent pattern was tied for Western waters but is effective just about everywhere . Search pocket water and fast currents with this pattern-it 's practically unsinkable-and do n't be afraid to use a big one , even in smaller streams . Though a first-rate attractor , a Stimulator can imitate a variety of insects . The broad silhouette and bushy wing mimic the blocky body and fluttering wings of an adult stonefly . Use smaller sizes during a caddis hatch . In late summer , plop itS hard on bankside water during grasshopper season . Photograph // Chernobyl Ant . Land-based insects are prime trout food , and the Chernobyl Ant is an exceptional all-around terrestrial pattern . In the small sizes , it resembles an ant ; go a little bigger , and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or hopper . Rubber legs give this pattern some liveliness on the water , and the bright indicator spot on top makes it easy to see . You can also fish this fly with good results as a searching pattern or as a change-of-speed pitch ; throw it at a finicky trout that refuses your most delicate offerings , and you may get a surprise . Griffith 's Gnat . This pattern addresses a common , and invariably frustrating , fishing situation-trout that refuse everything in your fly box while delicately dimpling the surface as they take something too small to see . It could be little ants , or tiny mayflies , or microcaddis , or midges . But it does n't really matter . Often enough in trout fishing , fly size is far more important than color , shape , or pattern . When trout are sipping the small stuff , a little Griffith 's Gnat usually turns the trick . It is also a good change-of-pace pattern for any rising fish that refuses your best efforts ; sometimes just going small makes the difference . NYMPHS Hare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ear is probably the most widely used nymph in America . It looks like nothing in particular and a lot of things in general and possesses that overall bugginess that makes it one of the best subsurface prospecting patterns that I know . On a dead-drift , shallow or deep , in any kind of water , any time of year , this one rings the dinner bell . The shape generally suggests a mayfly nymph , and the fly can be especially productive in riffles or pools prior to a hatch . But you can fish it on the swing during a caddis hatch and even use it as a scud imitation in weedy spring creeks . If I were restricted to just one nymph pattern , I 'd knot on a Hare 's Ear . Pheasant Tail . Another nobrainer . The body shape here generally suggests the slimmer silhouette of a large class of mayfly nymphs known as " swimmers . " The Pheasant Tail was originally designed for fishing spring creeks and is still one of the best patterns for flat , clear , shallow water and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fished deep , in tandem with a heavier nymph , this fly will take large trout . In size 18 and smaller , the pattern does double duty as a midge pupa in rivers or lakes . Sparkle Pupa . This pattern was developed to imitate a hatching caddis pupa , which it does with remarkable effectiveness . During a hatch , an unweighted fly can be fished in the surface film or , with split shot , deeper in the water column . Were this just a hatch-matching fly , though , it probably would n't make my list . But the Sparkle Pupa is a highly productive , all-purpose prospecting pattern . Even if I have n't seen a caddis for weeks , I 'll comb the riffles with this fly-right along the bottom-and rarely be disappointed . The shimmer and sparkle of the Antron bubble seems to be the secret , and this fly often turns the trick when more subtle or subdued patterns draw a blank . Photograph // Krystal Flash Baetis . This is not a widely known pattern , just one of the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nymphs of blue-wing olives , a widely distributed group of mayfly species . But this fly is a wonderfully consistent producer just about anywhere , anytime . It may be the subtly alluring sparkle of the Krystal Flash body , or it may be that blue-wing olive nymphs are so abundant that they figure into the trout 's menu most of the time . Try fishing this deep , as a dropper off a large weighted nymph . It 's also an excellent choice to imitate midge pupa . STREAMERS Woolly Bugger . I 've chosen only one streamer pattern , and there 's a good reason-I 've never needed another . In fact , I 'd venture that , day in and day out , over a huge range of conditions , there is n't a more effective pattern for taking trout , especially big trout , than the Woolly Bugger . It can be fished down-and-across like a conventional streamer , cast to the bank and stripped in , retrieved with short twitches , or ( my favorite ) deaddrifted right along the bottom , where it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nymph . The essence of its success is the superior mobility of the hackle and marabou tail ; it does n't just look alive , it acts alive . Photograph Sidebar THE BEAD BRIDGE Sidebar Most of the subsurface patterns in the Deadly Dozen can be tied beadheadstyle , and these versions can be just as effective as the originals-sometimes more . Metal beads give a bit of flash to the fly , and more important , add weight near the hook eye to produce a jigging action . One of the most effective ways to fish a beadhead is as a dropper behind a dry fly . Clinch-knot 2 feet of tippet to the bend of a high-floating dry ( Elk Hair Caddis and Stimulators are excellent for this ) ; then tie the beadhead to the other end . Fish the dry fly as usual , and the nymph will take care of itself . Even a Woolly Bugger can be tied with a bead , giving this already active fly even greater action . - T.L. // <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a warm June day in 1944 , Wink Dutton , known most recently to the U.S. Army as Staff Sergeant Winton S. Dutton , special correspondent and burgeoning cartoonist and illustrator , stepped out onto the streets of Chicago in his civvies . In his pocket , he had seventeen dollars , the address of his buddy 's camera shop , a short list of publishers and advertising agencies , and the Purple Heart awarded to him for misunderstanding an ensign 's instructions regarding a flywheel aboard a sub he was supposed to be working up a piece on for the pages of Yank magazine . <br> The ensign had probably told him more than clearly to " Keep your finger out of this here , " but given the effects of a bottle of peach brandy the night before  --  a gift from a grateful quartermaster colonel for the boldly rugged rendering he 'd done of him to accompany an article about fruitcake distribution and Christmas morale  --  the submarine tour seemed more like a cacophony of alarms , whistles , bells , and bellowing . He could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering a riveter 's competition at a shipyard . Between the banging in his head and the banging in the tin can that was the USS ( name censored for military secrecy ) , the only message he was able to receive was " Be sure to touch this flywheel I 'm pointing to . " <br> He did n't actually lose the hand , just proper use of the middle finger down to the pinky , plus the tip of the middle finger , right where he rested his pencils , pens , and paintbrushes . <br> " It 's the fuck finger and then some , " the navy doctor informed him . " You can still pinch , of course . " <br> " Great , " he 'd told him . " I 'll put in for a transfer to the Pinching Brigade . I 'll get right on that . " <br> Before Wink shipped out of Townsville , Queensland , Sergeant Bill Chesterton , known to his fellow correspondents and poker players as Chesty , stopped by to say good-bye and good luck  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he check in on his wife , Sal , and tell her he loved her still and was still being true ? <br> " Absolutely , " he told him , and resisted horsing around with any cheap jokes  --  offering to do more than that for him or doubt the man 's statement of fidelity . It was the sort of thing guys did , the way they kidded , but personally , he thought it was a little too mean and a little too easy . And a little too close to the sort of demoralizing crap guys could hear plenty just by dialing in Tokyo Rose on the radio . <br> Besides , he counted himself lucky for having no such serious attachments  --  either back in the States or in the Pacific theater  --  and it was only this luck , he knew , that kept him from being such a vulnerable , miserable , hang-faced slob . <br> He made four stabs at the job search that first day in Chicago . All three interviewers were respectful and very complimentary of his portfolio . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new situation  --  that he would n't be able to illustrate or cartoon anymore and that the third thing he did , marginally well , writing copy , was also limited as he had yet to relearn how to write with the other hand , and it left his typing appallingly more hunt-and-peck  --  nevertheless agreed that he would still make a great art director . Unfortunately , neither one currently had any art director positions available . At one of the four stops , an ad agency that was doing a lot of promotional poster work for the bond drive , he was told they might be needing a new stock boy in the art department soon , but that would n't happen for another month and only if the husband of the girl currently holding the job got shipped stateside , in which case they imagined she would most likely want to quit work and return to taking care of her home . It hardly sounded like a long shot . <br> And say it worked out  --  what was the jackpot ? Counting gum erasers and reordering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless ration forms just to order the stuff ? Bearing the abuse and demands of actual illustrators and art directors , whose job he should have ? Fun . <br> No , at this rate , he was likely going to have to head home to Michigan , maybe help out at his uncle 's farm in St. Johns till he could retrain himself as a lefty . <br> So it was with a sense of defeat and lean prospects that he sought out a room at a walk-up hotel he 'd gotten off a list from the VA . Jobs aside , he did n't even feel that upbeat about the chance of scrounging a good meal . It was almost five . Chow time was n't that far off , and checking in had already put him down another buck fifty . <br> After hanging his one extra shirt on the hook on his door , he lay back on the clangy little bed  --  no worse than Government Issue , but he 'd grown used to the nonreg hammocks and hooch pads of the South Pacific . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his suit for the job hunt ahead , and stared out the window at a billboard across the street . Of course , it was imploring him to buy U.S. bonds . <br> " Sure thing , Unc , " he said to himself . " First nickel I earn . " <br> He wished he at least had a book to read . Maybe , with a book , he could distract himself enough to stay in the room all night and skip going out and wasting what little coin he had in his pocket on tying one on . Maybe if it were a really engaging read , he could manage to distract himself enough to skip dinner , too . <br> Already he was thinking what places there were to eat around the hotel and how much it would put him out . <br> He realized then that he was on Adams . Chesty 's camera shop was on Adams , the number not far off from his hotel address . He figured he might as well go look up the guy 's wife and check that errand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been keeping it from Chesty , but the camera shop just was n't making it . It had n't done well before Pearl , during the Depression , but with the war on now , folks ' loose money had other practical purposes than camera equipment or even getting film developed . Occasionally , someone brought in their old Brownie to be repaired , and there were ardent hobbyists who simply had to splurge , but for the most part , the shop was a leaky boat , losing money every month her husband had been away . <br> Sal tried to make up the difference as best she could moonlighting at the Trib as a darkroom tech . She 'd spoken to an editor about picking up an assignment as a photographer . He was an admirer of Chesty 's and so was n't overtly rude about it , but did say , " We 're not quite there yet , Sal . " <br> He offered to put in a word for her in the secretarial pool , but she told him she could n't type . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class two straight years in high school  --  but it had n't come down to being a secretary yet . Doing that would mean full-time , daytime hours , hence closing the shop . We 're not quite there yet , she thought . <br> One of the other possibilities she had n't fully explored was something she found in the back of the photography magazines they sold at the shop  --  small ads , phrased with discretion , asking for girlie photos . Typically , they said things like : <br> WE BUY ART PHOTOS <br> $$$ paid for QUALITY pics <br> With Male Appeal <br> Life Study Naturist Sun Worship <br> For publishing/mass market <br> Very Reasonable Offers <br> She 'd gone as far as writing a few of them  --  queries only , with only two or three photos enclosed  --  asking for a little more guidance in terms of subject matter . <br> She thought she had a pretty good idea what they were driving at . <br> The photos she enclosed she shot herself , as samples . To make sure they did n't just steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , grainy and raw looking , shooting from the print , not the negative  --  she 'd further stymied them in any potential attempt to steal the shots by running a big X across the face in each with a grease pencil . <br> The face , of course , was her face . She 'd decided to pose for these practice shots herself , using a timer gizmo of her husband 's own devising . No sense going to the trouble of hunting up subjects and shelling out a modeling fee for something she was n't sure could even turn a profit . <br> In the first , she was standing behind a wingback chair , her breasts resting on the back of it , peeking over the top . She did n't enjoy the look of her large nipples in that one . They seemed to be staring back at the camera like the wide eyes of an owl . <br> The second was her sitting in the chair , legs tucked up under her chin , her arms wrapped around the whole business , hiding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been trying for coy and coquettish , but she looked , she thought , more like she had some sort of intestinal issues , maybe an ulcer or just really bad heartburn . <br> The third , she just lay on her tummy on a towel on the floor , at a right angle to the camera , her chin propped up on her hands , her head tipped slightly in the direction of the tripod . To her , her grin seemed pasted on , but it was x-ed out , anyway , and besides , these were just test shots . <br> After practicing a manlier hand , she signed the queries S. Dean Chesterton . It was her name , after all  --  Dean was her maiden name  --  but she was n't surprised when one of the replies began with Dear Dean . <br> Two things did surprise her : they offered up no criticism of her composition and lighting . She knew she did n't have Chesty 's eye , but they 'd failed to mention these flaws . And the second surprise was she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are running a tad more conservative , Dean . Ease up on the flesh . <br> We want to show the boys in uniform what they 're fighting for , but the USO does not like dispensing anything that might get them thinking the girls back home are too sexed up &amp; easy &amp; begging for it . <br> More girl-next-door brunette is big right now  --  less blonde bombshell . Long leg shots . Think mild distraction , Dean . ( Just enough to get the boys hot , not enough to get them worried and going AWOL ! ) <br> And speaking of uniforms , may we suggest that 's a great way to dress up your model . Half a sailor 's tunic , maybe an aviator 's cap , cocked at a flirty angle . Get the girls saluting , waving flags , straddling cannons  --  that sort of thing . <br> Another , hand scribbled , just said : <br> Think " home fires burning , " Mac  --  not " my pussy 's on fire . " Maybe next time . <br> This last had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used that word in addressing her before . Even if it was only written and not spoken out loud , it was a little jarring . Besides , she had n't shown her pussy , for Pete 's sake . Merely her bottom and her legs and her bosom , especially in that one that came off as an owl impression . <br> All the responses said the grease pencil Xs were unnecessary , that they were legitimate brokers and not in the business of using any photographer 's work without legal authority and complete monetary compensation . <br> Legitimate , she thought . Right . <br> She 'd have to give it a little more consideration before proceeding . <br> Continues ...
