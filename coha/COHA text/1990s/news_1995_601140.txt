<p> Seagram CEO Edgar Bronfman Jr . is intoxicated with show business . As a teen-ager he ran errands for film producer David Puttnam . Later , the heir to a $ 4 billion fortune backed plays and movies , such as Jack Nicholson 's 1982 drama , The Border . He also wrote the lyrics for Dionne Warwick 's 1986 tune Whisper in the Dark . <p> Now the spotlight is on the 39-year-old liquor company baron as he prepares to stage his biggest and most dramatic production yet . He made a deal to spend about $ 7 billion to buy an 80% stake in MCA from Matsushita Electric . <p> To get the money , Thursday he sold 156 million of 164.2 million shares of DuPont stock back to the chemical giant for $ 8.8 billion . Seagram stock closed down 3/4 Thursday at $ 27 7/8 ; DuPont was up 1 1/2 at $ 64 3/4 ; and Matsushita American depositary receipts were up 1/4 to $ 157 1/4 . <p> Now the question in Hollywood is : What talents does Bronfman bring to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring to the table , " says Robert Leininger , an analyst who follows Seagram for money manager Gabelli . " A lot of people are concerned about that . " <p> MCA needs help . Universal is n't generating many blockbusters these days . The first quarter of this year , it ranked sixth in market share ; box office revenue was down nearly 48% from a year earlier . Its TV operation is struggling . And the recorded music division is still relatively small - trailing Time Warner , Sony , Bertelsmann and PolyGram . MCA 's one bright spot : Universal theme parks , which drew a record 8 million visitors last year . <p> Wasserman and MCA President Sidney Sheinberg wanted to jump-start the company by making some acquisitions . They tried to join a partnership to buy a TV network . But Matsushita , which bought MCA for $ 6.6 billion in 1990 with promises they would have a free hand , said no . Matsushita also turned down Sheinberg 's proposal to buy Virgin Records for $ 1 billion and refused to give the executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a showdown between MCA and Matsushita officials at a meeting in a San Francisco hotel last October . Sheinberg , 60 , is said to have blown his top as he and Wasserman , 82 , - implicitly , if not explicitly - gave an ultimatum . Either Matsushita - which makes Technics and Panasonic electronic products - would have to let them run the company their way , or they 'd leave when their contracts expire later this year . <p> Perhaps more important , Matsushita knew the executives could take some of MCA 's biggest assets with them . Director Steven Spielberg and music executive David Geffen had just announced their plans to create a new entertainment company with former Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg - DreamWorks SKG . They said they 'd cut their ties with MCA if Wasserman and Sheinberg leave . <p> It was a shuddering thought . Spielberg either directed or produced six of the studio 's 10 top-grossing films : E.T. , Jurassic Park , Jaws , Back to the Future , The Flintstones and Back to the Future II . And Geffen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including such hit-making bands as Guns N ' Roses . <p> Matsushita did n't blink . The electronics giant , which had about $ 64 billion in revenue last year , started to look for a buyer with help from investment bankers Allen &; Co. and Goldman Sachs , and super-agent Michael Ovitz , CEO of Creative Artists Agency . <p> Bronfman was a natural . He 's a pal of Ovitz and of former QVC chief Barry Diller . He also was determined to bring Seagram deeper into show business . By early 1994 , the company had bought nearly 15% of Time Warner amid widespread speculation that Bronfman wanted it all . <p> Time Warner cut him off . It adopted a poison pill : The company would issue new shares , to dilute an investor 's stake , if anyone tried to buy more than 15% . And Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin has n't offered the company 's largest shareholder a seat on the board . <p> Some Seagram investors and board members were said to have wished the company would take on Time Warner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to make a smaller , friendlier deal with Matsushita . <p> What will Bronfman do with his prize ? Nobody - at least nobody outside Seagram - knows . Few believe Bronfman will try to run MCA himself . <p> " I ca n't believe that Seagram would do this without talking to ( Wasserman and Sheinberg ) or that they would even think of doing this without knowing what 's happening with Spielberg , " says analyst Lee Isgur of Jefferies &; Co . <p> Late Thursday Bronfman reportedly had n't spoken to Wasserman or Sheinberg about the deal . Meanwhile Ovitz is thought to be the leading contender to run MCA , although a spokeswoman , denies he 's interested . One much-speculated possibility is Diller , who is trying to make a deal for CBS . <p> There 's also uncertainty about what Seagram will do with its Time Warner stock . Seagram is likely to face antitrust problems if it tries to keep that stake and run MCA . But Seagram would have to sell at a loss if it tried to unload its stake in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe Seagram would try to sell its Time Warner stake to another company . Names that pop up frequently include US West , which already has a stake in Time Warner 's entertainment properties , and General Electric , which owns NBC and has long been interested in Time Warner . <p> From a storyteller 's point of view , there 's a wonderful sense of inevitability about the marriage of Seagram and MCA . Both flowered during the Roaring ' 20s . During Prohibition , bootleggers used to smuggle Seagram whiskey out of Canada to satisfy the cravings of U.S. customers . When the dry years ended , Seagram was a nationally known brand . <p> Now Seagram produces and markets beverages around the world . Its products include Martell cognac , Perrier-Jouet champagne , Chivas Regal and Seagram 's 7 Crown whiskeys , as well as Tropicana juices and drinks . <p> MCA , which once stood for Music Corporation of America , got its start as a booking agency for bands in Chicago . Chairman Lew Wasserman started as a bouncer at a gang-run speakeasy .

He sold Seagram 's 24.2% stake in DuPont  --  an estimated 80% of the liquor maker 's 1994 profits . Seagram likely will have to sell its 15% stake in Time Warner .
