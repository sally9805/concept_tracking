Along with Susan Rothenberg , Joel Shapiro , Neil Jenney and a few others , the painter Robert Moskowitz usually gets credited with bringing figurative imagery back into " advanced " art at the end of the 1970s . Whether you think this true depends on where you were looking . In fact , serious figurative art never went away  --  it just got hammered out of fashion by minimalism , the last great American style , in whose reductive embrace Moskowitz grew up just as it was coming to an impasse . As for " advanced , " who gives a damn anymore ? But no matter : Moskowitz 's current exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City ( on view through April 24 ) contains some admirable paintings , even if the run-up to them is gradual . <P> Moskowitz , 54 , was a slow developer , and has remained a decidedly uneven artist . But he never fell into the ghastly Warhol ethos that gelded so many talents in the ' 80s . The show starts with early collages involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jasper Johns . It proceeds through a prolix series of paintings from the ' 60s that depict the corner of an imaginary " ideal " and utterly banal room with no furniture in it , done in very close-valued colors that turn the image into a benign parody of Ad Reinhardt 's black paintings . Odd little signs  --  a blurt of pigment here , a " Have a Nice Day " face there  --  float in front of the room . You get the impression that Moskowitz , who has been a Zen student most of his adult life , is repeating a sort of koan without giving the slightest clue to its meaning . <P> The same mild frustration is built into his even more spaced-out images from the ' 70s , in which legible but quite unrelated signs for things float on a field of color in a way that very distantly recalls Miro . Cadillac/Chopsticks , 1975 , is just what it says : the rear-half profile of a ' 60s Caddy , bulbous with fins , and in the lower right a red X depicting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much helped by the otherwise useful catalog essay of Ned Rifkin , to whom , it seems , Moskowitz " revealed that the Cadillac might represent Hollywood glamour and the car culture of the West Coast , while the chopsticks could allude to a New Yorker 's love of Chinese food . " No kidding . This , you could say , looks like art history at the end of its rope . <P> Things firm up toward the ' 80s . The picture that changed Moskowitz 's style was Swimmer , 1977 , a canvas bearing the head and raised arm of a figure in the sea . This figure is quite an abstract form , and it is embedded , heraldically , in a dark field of Prussian blue . From now on Moskowitz 's work would look for strong , immediately recognizable icons that were submerged into abstraction by their elaborate , nondescriptive surfaces . They combine frankness of silhouette with loss of detail , and the effect is mysterious and poignant .               @ @ @ @ @ @
