The UK 's science community heartily welcomed the government 's planned increase in science funding , announced in mid-July . Following a long lean period , the science budget will be fattened by about 1.4 billion ( $2.3 billion ) over the next three fiscal years . A hetty portion of this money , 400 million , has been committed by the Wellcome Trust , the world 's wealthiest biomedical foundation , and is the largest-ever contribution made by the private sector to the UK 's public spending . The Wellcome money may be used only for research related to life sciences and , in an unusual arrangement , the foundation 's new head , Michael Dexter , will be involved in overseeing its distribution . Not surprisingly , with the government also stressing life sciences , physicists ' enthusiasm about the budget hike is tempered by apprehension about how much their field will actually reap . <p> Broadly , for fiscal years 1999-2001 , the government will divvy up 403 million ( of the 1.4 billion total ) among its six research councils ( which will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects " in priority areas like life sciences " ; 300 million will be distributed to university researchers by the government 's Higher Education Funding Council of England ; 600 million , in equal parts from the government and the Wellcome Trust , will be used for improving university infrastructure , including modernizing laboratories and equipment ; and the Wellcome Trust will put 100 million , or about half the predicted total cost , toward building a third-generation x-ray synchrotron light source . Wellcome 's support for the new machine-which would replace the world 's oldest secor.d-generation synchrotron light source , the 18-year-old facility at Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire-reflects the foundation 's interest in resolving molecular structures to exploit information about the human genome . <p> In terms of specific new measures , the government will switch from an annual to a three-year funding cycle , the minimum annual stipend for science graduate students will increase by 1000 , to 6455 , and the dual-support system , under which academics can apply for grants either from a research council or directly from their university department , will be retained ( university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months ) . Scientists like having the two sources for funding because it increases flexibility , " so that bright cheap ideas can be funded at the grass roots without the long costly grant applications " typical of the research council process , as Brian Foster , a highenergy physicist at the University of Bristol , puts it . A welcome budget hike <p> Even before the July announcement , there were hints that science would fare well in the 14-month , governmentwide Comprehensive Spending Review ( CSR ) initiated by the Labour Party when it came to power last year . But , says physicist John Mulvey , the outgoing head of the lobbying group Save British Science , the sum earmarked for science " is rather more than most people dared to hope . Most people were pretty stunned by the size of the increase . It 's not something we have seen for a long long time . " Research spending across the sciences by the research councils and universities combined has gone up in real terms over the past 15 years , but by only 1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem we have is that research funding started low , and the gap between funding levels in the UK and at universities in other countries has widened . " <p> " We all see this boost in science funding as a decisive change in the government 's attitude , " continues Mulvey . " They are now accepting that investment in the science base is an investment in the nation 's future . " But , he adds , " we still have a long way to go . " Leaving out the Wellcome contribution- " it 's a ' one-off , ' not something we can count on in future years "  --  Mulvey calculates that the science budget increase will average out to about 6% a year for three years . " If it keeps going , we will double science spending in twelve years . That 's what we shall press for . With anything less , we will not be able to sustain a world-class science base . " <p> In announcing the CSR results , Margaret Beckett , secretary of state for trade and industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of underinvestment in laboratories and equipment  --  and in the people themselves " have jeopardized science in the UK . The Wellcome Trust 's Dexter agreed , and in a speech about the foundation 's contribution , he said , " It is really distressing to see our next generation of scientists being trained on obsolete technology .... The Wellcome Trust money will help put the whole of the UK science base back where it belongs  --  at the forefront internationally  --  and will make a major difference in our ability to retain and recruit the highest caliber scientists . " Physicists ' fare <p> Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council ( PPARC ) boss Ian Halliday is " nervous but hopeful " about how the new money will be allocated . The particle physics and astronomy budget , the main funding source for about half of the UK 's physics research , has fallen in real terms by 12.4% since 1979 , and the University of Leicester 's Ken Pounds , who last March stepped down as PPARC head , says things are to the point " where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership in CERN and ESA the European Space Agency , and to allow investment in new projects such as Mars Express and the NASA-led Next Generation Space Telescope . " <p> Indeed , PPARC has a long list of projects that it wants to fund with its share of the new money . They include the LHC-B , the CERN experiment to check for CP violation ; ESA 's Planck Surveyor for mapping the cosmic microwave background ; the Millimeter Wave Array planned by the US 's National Radio Astronomy Observatory and the European Southern Observatory ; and an experiment for detecting dark matter , located in the Boulby potash mine in Yorkshire . <p> And the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council , which funds the hulk of physics research not covered by PPARC , will use the CSR money to " place emphasis on promoting the work of young scientists , " says EPSRC head Richard Brook . <p> But allocation of the 403 million among the two physics-related councils and the four other research councils will take some hammering out , with decisions expected next month at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jockeying for position between the councils and the Office of Science and Technology the body in charge of the research councils , " Foster says . The fraction of the budget going to biology and the medical sciences will tend to go up compared to that for other areas , he adds , " but I do n't believe there will be a big discrepancy . " <p> And , with half of the 600 million tagged for university infrastructure coming from Wellcome , " it follows that at least half will go to biomedical research , " says Tony Quigley , who is deputy to the director general of the research councils . " As for the other money , there is a general assumption of a priority for the biosciences . " Nonetheless , says SBS 's Mulvey , " new money for biomedical research will reduce pressure on money for the rest of science .
