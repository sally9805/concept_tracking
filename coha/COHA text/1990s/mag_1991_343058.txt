Sitting on an examining table at the Children 's Hospital in Pittsburgh , three-year-old Shawntea West is smiling and alert , apparently in excellent health . But she is afflicted with the most common of the serious childhood diseases . The mumps ? Viral meningitis ? Measles ? Whooping cough ? The answer , says Dr. Herbert Needleman as he draws blood from her arm , is lead poisoning . <P> During a routine checkup two weeks earlier , Shawntea was found to have a level of 25 micrograms of lead per deciliter of blood . If that toxic level is maintained , it could affect her mental capabilities and result in grave behavioral and physical problems . " She was living in raggedy housing and eating plaster from a big hole in the wall , " says her grandmother , who accompanied her . To Dr. Needleman , that is an important clue ; it is likely that some of the earlier coats of paint on the wall contained lead . " Make sure she washes her hands before she eats , " he says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> Shawntea 's case is hardly unique . From 3 million to 4 million American children  --  or about 1 out of every 6  --  under six years old have lead poisoning . While only 7% of young children from medium- and high-income families are afflicted , it affects 25% of poor white children and an incredible 55% of those from impoverished black families . <P> These startling statistics are contained in a " strategic plan " developed by the Department of Health and Human Services . Though HHS warns that the effects of exposure to even moderate amounts of lead are more pervasive and long lasting than was previously thought , its plan optimistically outlines a program for eliminating lead poisoning in children within 20 years . Dr. Needleman , a pioneer investigator of the disorder at the University of Pittsburgh medical school , feels that the goal is attainable . " Lead poisoning is the most severe environmental disease in this country , " he says , " and it is totally preventable . " <P> But total prevention could be an elusive goal . Americans are constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dense metal escapes into the air when used in industrial processes and can leach out of crystal glassware and imported pottery into food and drink . Lead solder in old plumbing often contaminates tap water . Government regulations have phased out most leaded gasolines , but the residue from the exhausts of millions of vehicles in years gone by still poisons the soil near major highways . And though lead-based paints were banned for most uses in 1977 , a 1988 Public Health Service report revealed that 52% , or 42 million , of the nation 's households have layers of lead-based paint on their walls and woodwork . <P> Even in minute quantities , lead is highly toxic . Some historians suggest that widespread lead poisoning contributed to the decline of ancient Rome , where the metal was used for tableware , weapons , cosmetics and water pipes in aqueducts , as well as in the processing of wine . Its prevalence , some conjecture , may have caused sterility , miscarriages and even insanity , particularly among members of the upper classes , who imbibed heavily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
