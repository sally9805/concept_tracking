Osama bin Laden is a hard man to find . An exile from Saudi Arabia , he has lived in Sudan for five years , but he is a recluse , and his whereabouts are known only to his aides and a handful of Sudanese officials . To arrange to see him , I first had to track down one of bin Laden 's associates in London . Then , at a tearoom near Charing Cross Station , I made a request for a meeting . Several weeks later , bin Laden sent encouragement . I traveled to Khartoum , and waited for a few days at a hotel when a message came through the front desk , " The businessman will see you . " <P> A Toyota with black-tinted windows picked me up and drove me through Khartoum . Finally , after arriving at a building on the outskirts of the city , I was shown into a cramped office where several bodyguards stood watchfully . Tall , barefoot , smiling broadly , bin Laden greeted me in a gold-trimmed robe and red-checkered headdress . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cushion as a seat . Depending on who is to be believed , this gracious hospitality came from either a devout Muslim businessman , as bin Laden would claim , or " one of the most significant financial sponsors of Islamic extremist activities in the world today , " as the U.S. State Department describes him . <P> The U.S. has a special interest in bin Laden because of the bombing that occurred last November at an American-run National Guard training center in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia . Seven people were killed , including five Americans . Last week , Saudi television broadcast the confessions of four men arrested in the bombing , and they said they had been influenced by faxes sent from bin Laden 's Advice and Reformation Committee . U.S. officials investigating the bombing believe bin Laden 's involvement may have gone further , and one says he is " high on our suspect list . " <P> Although virtually unknown in the West , bin Laden is a towering figure among Islamic fundamentalists . His late father rose from peasant origins in Yemen to become Saudi Arabia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated at $5 billion , and at 38 , Osama bin Laden personally controls a fortune of perhaps $300 million . In the 1980s he became famous in Islamic circles for his heroic role fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan as one of the main leaders of the Arab volunteers . A few years after the war , he went into exile in Sudan , where he runs several businesses  --  a construction firm , a farm that produces sunflower seeds , a tannery that exports goat hides to Italy .
