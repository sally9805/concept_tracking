It 's hard to think of anyone who could resist the call of today 's roaring bull market . So when agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration set out to crack a Colombian cocaine ring three years ago , they opened a fully licensed  --  but also fully bogus  --  brokerage in suburban Atlanta to get inside the drug world . Even though the customers never made a single stock trade  --  double-digit stock gains are paltry in contrast to 400% returns on cocaine  --  the sting paid off last week with federal indictments of five Colombians , who are believed to have ties to the Cali drug cartel , on drug trafficking and money-laundering charges . The indictments capped an international operation in which authorities have so far arrested more than 40 people in the U.S. and abroad and seized some 3,500 kg of cocaine and $10 million of laundered drug money . <P> The investigation began after authorities in Cartagena , Colombia , seized 386 kg of cocaine hidden inside containers of frozen fish shipped by a company with a distribution center in Atlanta . Drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds for suspected traffickers . As it played out , agents picked up drug funds in gym bags , luggage and boxes on the streets of such cities as New York , Dallas , Madrid and Rome . Then , with the help of black-market money changers in Colombia , the dollars were converted into pesos and deposited into the traffickers ' Colombian accounts . But much to the dismay of the brokerage firm 's clients , their gains turned out to be purely short term . <P>  --  By Daniel Eisenberg . Reported by Alain L. Sanders/New York
