4 writers were shown this painting and asked to interpret the image , creating original pieces of fiction . The result is four unique visions by Joyce Carol Oates , Lucius Shepard , Leigh Kennedy and Samuel R. Delany . <p> THE ARTIST <p> I began modestly with still lifes , here in my studio . The logic of the still life is self-evident : Its beauty is likely to be the classical beauty of form ; it does not move , or reveal new and unanticipated facets of being ; its will is at all times subservient to the artist 's own ; its decay is slow enough as to seem imperceptible . That first summer , my eighteenth , in an ecstasy of concentration I painted eggplants  --  dozens , hundreds ! Gorgeous gleaming purple-iridescent eggplants filled canvas after canvas , taking on , by the strokes of my brush , the mysterious contours and inner radiance of noble forms of being ! ( As if , as a critic for an influential Roman newspaper later claimed , Caravaggio himself had been reborn , turning his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyish energy , with no purpose beyond the transposition of life into art , the perishable into the imperishable , I also painted pumpkins , tomatoes , peppers , broccoli , cauliflowers .... In the garden behind our family villa , the vines began to shrivel ; the plants , some of them quite gigantic , grew wizened ; one might have thought it a natural consequence of the season 's change , except that the very soil , for centuries so rich , a luscious russet-red , grew gray and anemic , and crumbly , dissolving to dust between one 's fingers . Not even our heavy autumn rains could restore it , and one morning my sister Lucia ran into my studio , crying , " Look , Antonio ! It 's gone ! " <p> To the family 's astonishment , the entire hillside garden of several acres had vanished . Had erosion been eating away at it , from beneath , without our knowledge ? In place of the lush , fertile garden were ugly fissures in the earth , as deep as twelve feet , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lifeless . In time , spiky , bristly weeds grew there  --  if you look out this casement window you can see them , so stiff and unyielding , even the north winds ca n't sway them . <p> My elegant paintings , however , sold  --  sold wonderfully . Especially in Rome , where foreign travelers visit , wealthy Americans in particular . <p> Next , I turned my scrupulous attention upon the family parrot Sheba : an exotic creature imported from Brazil , with exquisite green , yellow , golden , and blood-red feathers , and a saucy crest , and shrewd , watchful , malicious eyes . As I painted , I whistled  --  and Sheba playfully mimicked my whistle . Sometimes I sang , to placate her , " Pretty bird ! O beautiful Sheba ! " and the creature mimicked my voice , though not my words , crying , " Fool ' Tonio ! Fool-fool ' Tonio ! " I laughed , and Sheba echoed my laughter , though in a mocking soprano . Why is it that household pets , especially parrots and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maharajas in their domestic settings ? Our beloved Sheba , thirty years old , was certainly the dominant will in our family , since Momma 's death the previous year . Even Poppa , Mayor of our provincial town , and , by ancestral tradition , a descendent of royalty , was no match for Sheba when she exerted her will squawk-squawk-squawking to get her way . <p> Of course , the South American parrot is one of the wonders of the natural world . In such brilliant , dazzling , painterly beauty , any number of flaws of character are forgiven ; and so it was in our household , with Sheba , whom we prized  --  I , Antonio , in particular . <p> My paintings of Sheba , sixteen of them painted within the space of a delirious two-week period , are valued as examples of " primitive genius "  --  " unschooled classicism "  --  " provincial magic . " Poppa and I exhibited them at a regional fair , and all the canvases were sold ; two were awarded prizes ; all were written up glowingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise , was the subject of a profile in a national magazine . Poppa acted as my broker , negotiating with buyers of my work , and putting my money in a special account in our local bank , under his name . He then gave me a fixed allowance , out of which I could buy my art supplies . " I hope you are pleased , Antonio ? " Poppa asked , stroking his beard  --  that rich , black , bristling beard that , from earliest boyhood , I could not help but envy . " Yes , Poppa , " I said quietly . " Your allowance is a very generous one , for a young man of your age and position , " Poppa said , as if testing me . But I said , quietly , as before , " Yes , Poppa . Very generous . " <p> After the heady success of the fair , I never painted another canvas with Sheba 's likeness . Following the temperamental vagaries of her species , Sheba began to pick at her breast , until most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick even at her wings and back , and was soon an ugly , blood-stippled sight . Lucia , who , after Momma 's death , had spoiled Sheba with all sorts of treats and special attentions , was upset at first ; and then despondent . And , unaccountably , angry at me  --  " If you had not painted her so beautifully , she might still be unblemished , " Lucia said . " You !  --  stealing her of her beauty , in the name of art ! " <p> It was a mercy when , one day , we discovered Sheba lifeless and stiff on the floor of her cage , amid droppings and dried patches of blood . Poor thing ! We all wept , including the servants . <p> And yet , how blissful the morning silence , uninterrupted by Sheba 's cries . <p> I had mentioned that Poppa was Mayor of our town . In fact , Poppa had been first elected to this illustrious post twenty-three years ago , but his term of office had been turbulent , and marred by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-election . In subsequent years , other holders of the office were similarly charged by their political rivals and enemies ( for ours is a contentious province ) , and the most recent , preceding Poppa 's second election , was sent to prison for extorting bribes and embezzlement  --  so that , as even Poppa 's critics were forced to admit , Poppa did not appear half so bad , by comparison ! So it has always been , for centuries , seemingly for millennia , in this remote , hilly , verdant province north of Rome . Graft , corruption , mendacity , vanity ! A history of infamy ! Which is why the more sensitive of its progeny have traditionally turned to the Church ( that is , to its ascetic orders , cloistered convents and monasteries ) , and to the abiding solace of art . For what does it profit a man , that he gain the world , but lose his soul ? <p> Poppa , in his position as Mayor , commissioned a portrait of himself , to be hung in the foyer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be but I , Antonio ! There were murmurings of nepotism , and complaints that the commission was far too generous ( though , by current standards , as such things are measured , the commission was not excessively high for an experienced artist , at least ) ; but Poppa paid not the slightest heed , and counseled me to behave likewise . <p> So , with some trepidation , I painted my own father 's portrait  --  the first human subject I ever undertook . Dear Poppa !  --  a vain , blustering , overbearing man , yet touchingly direct in his egotism . " Shall I paint you as you are , Poppa , " I asked politely , "  --  or as you wish to be remembered ? " Poppa , seated in the Mayor 's chair by an open window , his heavy head held unnaturally high and his bearing self-consciously regal , replied with childlike ingenuousness , " Why , paint me exactly as I am , silly boy  --  for that is how people will want to remember me . " <p> The sittings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who readily passed into an open-eyed daze , sated by wine and food ( our sessions were midafternoon , following Poppa 's enormous midday meal , which was nearly as lavish as his evening meal ) , or , by degrees , sank into a blissful , snoring , leaden sleep . Never had I known that painting  --  the wielding of a mere brush !  --  could be so arduous . It was as if , in painting my father , from whose veins my own rich blood had partly sprung , I was expunging , from myself , a secret part of myself , unfathomed until that time . How ugly Poppa was , for a man commonly spoken of as " handsome "  --  how venal , how petty , how self-important , how cruel and mendacious his features ! My brush moved gropingly at first , and I ruined one canvas after another , and had to start over , in disgust , having not the patience ( or , perhaps , the stomach ) to rework the original image , layering it in oils until it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to terms with Poppa 's image  --  with Poppa . The man 's strong-boned face  --  his black bristling beard  --  his deep-socketed , dark , glaring eyes  --  that smiling grimace that gave his face the look of a nocturnal creature surprised and displeased by daylight : All this I managed to transfer to the canvas , painting for hours without rest , in a trance , day following day . At the conclusion of a session . Poppa merely glanced at the canvas as it began to take shape , and grunted , whether in approval or disapproval I could not know ; in any case , uneducated as the man was , he had no true eye for art , and did not even know , as the truism has it , what he believed he should like . He did complain of my slowness , however  --  " Boy , d' you think you , and I , are going to live forever ? " Once seated in his cushioned chair , confident he would not be rudely interrupted ( for the Mayor 's assistants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office , and did it uncomplainingly , for shockingly modest salaries ) , Poppa quickly slipped into a daze , or a doze , while I , Antonio , labored to bring forth a portrait worthy of my name . <p> Which , I believe , I have done . <p> Of course , I have not the original  --  I have only this photograph , a poor reproduction that does not begin to suggest the portrait 's somber yet savage demeanor ; its formal elegance ; its rich chiaroscuro , " an ingenuous rendering of a petty tyrant , " as one reviewer has said , " worthy of the genius of Goya . " <p> The portrait was angrily denounced by Poppa 's successor in office , thus never hung in the foyer , as intended ; but it was eagerly purchased  --  at several times the price of the commission  --  by one of my New York collectors . Poor Poppa !  --  he did not arrange for the purchase , which would have pleased him enormously . <p> For Poppa is departed ; whither he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates , nor even the beautiful peasant woman with whom he sometimes slept , seem to know . <p> At our final session , Poppa slumped in his chair as usual ; and I , as usual , though perhaps more intensely than usual , labored at the ugly , intransigent image on the canvas , until my arm grew so heavy I could scarcely move my brush , and my body was slick with perspiration inside my clothes . I thought of the teachings of the great Englishman Locke , who looked upon man as an object in nature , not fundamentally distinct from other objects in nature , and wished , indeed willed , that the subject of my portrait , though nominally my father , but in essence a mere composite of molecules , atoms , and forcefields of incalculable subtlety , be transposed onto my canvas : rendered into my art , once and for all . <p> You are surprised , I did not pray to God ?  --  but , like any artist of genius , I do not believe in God . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God  --  the artist 's credo is that simple . <p> During that grueling session , however , Poppa played one of his pranks on me , He must have woken out of his sodden sleep , seen me fierce in concentration at the easel , and slipped away without my noticing ; oddly , for he was a large , bulky man , and hardly graceful on his feet . But when , at last near dusk , I looked up in triumph , knowing my portrait was finished , I saw that Poppa was gone  --  vanished ! His throne-like chair was empty , though the faded cushion bore the imprint of his solid buttocks , and the head and arm rests gleamed faintly with oil . The door to the stairs stood partly ajar . So obsessed had I been with the painting , I had not even heard Poppa 's heavy footsteps on the stairs . I had not even had the opportunity to murmur , " Goodbye , dear Poppa ! " as certainly I would have done , had I known he was departing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that very night that Poppa disappeared from our town . Some charged that the mayor had absconded with funds from a mutual cache he and his political cronies had established out of " lost "  --  or embezzled  --  municipal funds ; others claimed that he must have been abducted , and later murdered  --  for Poppa never reappeared , no news ever came of him , and his body , the proud bearer of a six-hundred-year-old name , was never found . <p> Lucia said , simply , gazing at Poppa 's portrait , " He is dead . Of course . " <p> Poor Poppa  --  but , more than that , poor Lucia ! In our household , it was she who grieved the most bitterly ; yet as much out of spite , I think , as genuine sorrow at our loss , for , being a woman , and unmarried , she eventually inherited only a modest portion of Poppa 's estate , and her brothers the remainder . I , Antonio , the youngest , received the most , for Poppa , even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own earnings as a painter to me . ( And these earnings were higher than I 'd known !  --  what a rascal , poor Poppa . ) As the months passed , Lucia not only mourned our father , but cast veiled , reproachful eyes upon me , as if  --  though , mean-spirited , purse-lipped , she never said so  --  my portrait of him was in some way responsible for his death . <p> But in what way ?  --  by all the paradigms of common sense ? <p> Thus , in stealth , to record for posterity the lineaments of the low-minded , suspicious , paranoid personality , so paradoxically housed in an ample , attractive , female body , I painted Lucia 's portrait too , without her knowledge  --  but that is another story . <p> You may see her here  --  her likeness , that is  --  in this photograph , which does not begin to do justice to the original , I 'm afraid . <p> The original ?  --  in a private collection , in New York City . <p> Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin ? <p> VICTORY <p> Last night I dreamed my legs were dancing . I saw them pale and perfect ( my best feature , I 've been told ) , sheared off neatly at mid-thigh , whirling against a starry sky , kicking their way across a plain that might have been the waste west of Al Hafra where I was shot down . Then some miserable lightning jolted along my spine , waking me , and I have spent the rest of the early morning answering a letter from my mother , trying to explain why I intend to stay in Cairo . My pension , I say , will not stretch so far at home ; the hashish is not so good , and no matter how cunning the prosthesis , a legless woman faces certain difficulties in finding lovers  --  I prefer the uncomplicated greed of Egyptian men to the twisted compulsions of American freaks . I hope these brutal half-truths will close the subject . There is nothing left for me in the States . The yellow ribbon tied about the maple in my parent 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course there are no Egyptian lovers , no hashish , no cheap hotel room in Cairo  --  Cairo is but the emblem of some guilt , some unresolved emotional business with the region . My only realities are the voices of the VA doctors and the clever machines that seek to drag me back from the serenity of my psychological retreat by creating this dream world and coaxing me to act out my feelings of loss . I am not a fool , I understand these things . Yet my sentiments remain unchanged . I prefer a dream life to one of constant pain , pitying stares and condescension , of medals , bunting , and empty words ; I intend to fight for it . They are , after all , my dreams , and I know best how to manipulate them . I want to fold them about me like a magic cloak , to create a rich , impenetrable solitude . I stare out the window onto Tewfik Square . On a traffic island at its center stands the colossal statue of Ramses II , ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . We are both victims of foolish obsessions . But I will become no monument to mine . At nine o'clock I spread my photographs , my souvenirs of war , on the table . In one I am standing beside a Cobra gunship , flight helmet in hand , smiling tightly . Touching it , I feel the surge of engines , the pulse of rotors ( tremors from a black box whose wires lead into my head ) , and in a second I am aloft , skimming low over the dunes . Behind me , phalanxes of M-1 tanks and LAVs , black Stealth queens in their hangar hives , wombs bursting with rockets . I hear in the distance the baying patriotism of a country swollen with dumb pride , tough talk from old political men with nothing to lose but their reputations ( " What 's that ? Ca n't you sharpen the image ? " " She 's back in the chopper again . " " Christ ! Get her out of there ! " ) , the one fueling the other , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sky is a luminous , grainy blue , beaded white with tracers and popcorn blooms of anti-aircraft fire that spray upward from a legendary city , its skyline figured with onion domes and mountains of blood , Statues of Liberty and World Trade Centers . My missiles perform surgical strikes , slice the tops from phallic minarets , blind the faceted eyes of office buildings . My twenty-millimeter cannon herds victims along the avenues : teenagers in tight jeans , women in chador , miniskirted whores , soldiers of every nation . No need for damage assessment . For each death a fuming black star materializes in my brain . The vengeance I take is purely personal  --  I am no longer political . <p> I land in a dusty square at the edge of the souk . Narrow winding streets , stucco walls inset with doors of many colors , the signs above the shops with fringed curtains a neon tangle of Arabic and Roman script . Unmindful of the crowd 's babble ( " Where the hell is she ? " " Some kind of market . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ! " " Then shut it down ! " " You know damn well that 'll fry her brains , man ! " ) , I idle among stalls selling fruit that glows like immense gems , the stuffed heads of presidents , love potions , helicopter parts , camel saddles , peace accords . At the Shop of Legs , a dark little monkey-man in a fez and a shabby suit displays his wares . Tawny , muscular legs ; soft lover 's legs ; model 's legs , long and shapely . All hung from the ceiling on steel pins . " But for you , beautiful lady , " he says , " something special . " He draws back a crimson curtain to reveal a pair like none other . Inscribed with a jeweled circuitry that produces hot-orange butterflies , emerald serpents , and ruby skulls , images like electric tattoos on the milky skin . Some of the toes twitch , sensing my presence . <p> The legs meld with my stumps , we are one , and I feel the circuitry spreading through me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belly , indigo birds bloom on my breasts golden lions peer out though my eyes . Moon-colored vines filigree my secret hair . As I stroll , wrapped in a kind of heated calm , I accept this Arabian night for my new home ; it seems sufficiently vivid to suit the tempers of my torched spirit . The eyes of men in the cages smoking water pipes harden into scorpions that lift their tails into crescent shapes . Tigers lounge on silk cushions in the shadows . Houris waver like mirages . But gradually , chaos is invading the souk . Out of the corners of my eyes I see curious dark shapes scuttling , speaking in crackling voices like the sounds of fire ( " I do n't like these readings , man . " " Then do something , damn it ! " " I ca n't fucking reach her ! " ) . Scents of mustard gas mingle with those of myrrh , and attar of roses . Nightingales mate in their cages , a flurry of brown wings and songs like the whistles of incoming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , offering sanctuary . In the dimness beyond them I make out somnolent stirrings , seductive in their rhythms , and am afraid to enter . Beside one , a man in a conservative blue suit wields a dagger , slicing the abdomen of a young boy . Red doves and oil explode from the wound . Plants with teeth shatter the pavement , paper garbage grows wings and flaps off into the night sky . An old man scurries past , bleeding from a dozen cuts , clutching a television set to his chest ; in a brightly lit restaurant seven sheiks and their veiled women begin dancing to a tune by Prince . <p> The street noise has reached a crescendo ( " I 'm not getting a response ! Code Blue ! Stat ! " ) . Time to escape , I know , but I am still frightened of the doors ; I did not plan to escape this way . My legs are cold , as if immersed in chill water , my thoughts are eddying , insubstantial , and I feel I am shrinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged man with a bushy Stalin mustache and a fancy uniform . The sword helps stem my fear , settles my dissolute feeling . I turn toward one of the doors and spot an Arab man in camo gear standing beside it . A soldier , a veteran . His eyes are blurred like dirty windows in rain . His deep wounds are invisible . As I approach , his eyes clear to smoked glass and I see the shocks of combat stirring in them , seductive rhythms that echo those I have glimpsed beyond the doorways . Like me , he is no longer political . I know I can trust him , and staring at him , I lose my fear , I yield up my last hopes , my fond memories  --  oh , the times I 've had ! Somewhere in the packed mosaic of states , a bar mirror clouds with the smokes of my regret . This soldier and I have not even language in common , but as new and brighter shocks singe the skin above my heart , sending me jumping like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , we share the holy knowledge of the fallen . This , we say , entering the door , still cautious , unsure , yet growing more secure on sipping the cool air of the courtyard into which we move , as vast and ill-defined as the temple at Karnak or the Valley of the Moon ... this is horror , we say , this is the black answer , the abyss , the undoing , but we also understand that this is resolution , this is peace , this is how all nightmares must end , how all good dreams begin in the season of the Hellfire missile , in the false spring of the American spirit , in the age of Saddam Hussein . <p>  --  Lucius Shepard <p> THE PRESERVATION OF LINDY <p> My second wife , Mariana , wanted to have a holographic preservation made of us but I told her , first , we could n't afford it and , second , I did n't believe in preservations . <p> I knew I should have mentioned the one of my daughter , Lindy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made her angry and jealous ; there are some things that she does n't understand . <p> I had n't visited Lindy for a long time . The courtship and marriage to Mariana had brushed the past aside . But the anniversary of Lindy 's accident made me want to see her again . <p> Once a nursery and then my first wife 's sewing room , crammed with Jake 's and Lindy 's childhood things , spare blankets , suitcases , an outdated encyclopedia , the room was nostalgic and quiet . I found the frame and , after moving a bookcase and a box of old clothes , I managed to set it up . <p> Standing before the slatted door , I hesitated a long while . When this portrait had been made , no one had known that Lindy would only live another few months . <p> The perfection of Lindy 's preservation stopped me from seeing or hearing my little girl any more . Either I had been a distant father or Lindy a perfect child ; no tantrums , grazed knees , or embarrassing events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a persistent clamoring bell , Lindy behind this door has drowned out all other memories of her . I have scratched and scratched in my mind to remember the real Lindy , but it all is overshadowed by the vividness of the portrait . It is all I have of her now . <p> Which was why I was philosophically against Space-Time-Sensory Preservation Portraits . They are too strong , too real . They wipe out the ephemeral and confused process of human memory by being too good . <p> I opened the door and stepped inside . <p> Lindy sat at a plain table . A touch of sullenness tipped her mouth as she looked down at paper art prints on the tabletop . She was tidy , clean , her clothes soft and comfortable looking , her thick brown curls bursting out from a blue half-turban . Her face and nose were long , like her mother 's , but her chin and hair and solid tall frame were from my family . <p> She did n't move at first but her eyes looked up from the table to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindy smiled . " Hello . " <p> One could see a hint of the teasing , tart fun in Lindy 's personality . She was nobody 's fool but she liked to laugh . Then she shuffled the papers together and placed them on a square paperweight , which had been under her elbow . Her feet shifted on the tile floor with a soft scraping sound . <p> The preservation flickered , like a badly cut film , as the loop started to run again . Again Lindy leaned forward , gaze on the table . I walked around the table to behind her . She looked towards the door . " Hello . " <p> I saw the mole on the back of her neck , just visible when she sat up straight and tilted her head . I saw the indentations in her skin where her elbow had rested on the paperweight . On the floor behind her was her handbag , worn on the strap . Out of the pocket jutted a corner of the book that she had been reading that day . I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to pull it out of the bag but I knew that there was nothing really there to touch . <p> I circled back to her face . Her hands and lips appeared slightly chapped . It had been winter at the time of the preservation . Rain fell on the window , the skies were gray and the roofs of neighboring houses wet . I heard water dripping from our eaves . <p> A flicker . Her eyes raised . " Hello , " she said again . <p> As I stood there , a memory within a memory , the ring of lasers stared at me from the floor . I felt odd , seeing them make the record  --  as if I had intruded and the next time I would be in the preservation , too . <p> I heard an unexpected noise and saw Mariana , my wife , peering through the slatted door . I was immobilized by her look of wordless fury . She stared first at Lindy , then came inside . <p> She turned to me . I was trying to think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine , looking at me intently . <p> " Mariana ? " I said , uncomfortable in her scrutiny . <p> She screamed , suddenly , shortly , and bit her knuckle as if to stop herself . Then she grasped both my hands . " Good God ! " It 's really you , is n't it ? " <p> I laughed , realizing that she had thought I was part of the preservation . Lindy was shuffling prints again as I swept my hand in introduction . " Mariana , meet my daughter , Lindy . Lindy , this is your stepmother . " <p> Flicker . A sullen look and then Lindy 's eyes raised again . " Hello . " Her gaze was just off Mariana 's face . <p> " I thought you did n't believe in preservations , " Mariana said irritably . <p> " Well , I do n't . This is why . This is all I can remember of my little girl . One memory , that 's all . " <p> " I thought you said you could n't afford them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't . " I looked at my wife . She was n't happy with me . Could I explain ? " You do n't understand the power of these things . They have such a presence that they wipe out all natural memory . Like seeing yourself in the mirror every day  --  it 's always a shock when you see a photo five years old and realize that you have aged . You just ca n't remember . I ca n't remember anything about Lindy . Nothing that feels real anyway . " <p> " That 's silly . It 's like not believing in photographs or anything not written down . " <p> Mariana watched as I collapsed the door , lasers , and viewing milieu into something barely larger than a good world atlas  --  all containing Lindy , her prints , her table , the gray rain on the window , and the neighborhood beyond . As I slid it on the top of a wardrobe , I thought , goodbye for now , Lindy , sweetheart . <p> " You would n't want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her . <p> Mariana just gave me a sharp look . It was n't the last I heard of her wishes . <p> One morning , several months later , I opened an envelope and told Mariana the news . We had a refund from the tax office , a free and handsome windfall . It was n't often that there was good news about money . <p> Immediately , she said , " We can afford a double preservation portrait then . " <p> I had forgotten the entire issue but from her promptness it was obviously uppermost in her thoughts . <p> " I thought I told you that I do n't believe in them . " <p> " But you have one of your daughter . " <p> " Experience is the reason I do n't believe in them . " <p> " Why do n't you throw it away ? " she challenged . " Or let Jake have it ? " <p> Jake , my son , lived in a different place every six months . He would lose Lindy within a year . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impending storm now fully developed within her , threw her napkin on the table angrily . <p> " You do n't care about having anything to remember me by ! " she said . " You never photograph me , you never have kept any notes or cards that I gave you , you do n't even look at me anymore ! " <p> " Mariana ! Not true ! " I said . " I do n't want anything but you to remember . I want to see your face every day , not some unreal thing . Just this morning I was watching you sleep and thinking how lucky I am . I was remembering the day that you came to dinner and we sat on the floor , listening to  --  " <p> " Words , words ! " she said , weeping and sounding completely forlorn and wounded . " Just go and spend your money on whatever you like ! " She ran out of the room . <p> Had I really neglected her so badly ? I was devastated to discover that she was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It took all the tax money plus a bit of savings to do a single portrait of Mariana . <p> I asked for something simple and everyday . <p> In her preservation , Mariana stood at the window in our front room and pulled the heavy curtains open , her arms outstretched , her back slightly arched . Mature , yet lithe  --  beautiful , elegant , casual . The sun came in on her face , diffused by the lace curtains . She turned her head and smiled at me lovingly , pleased to be asked at last . <p> It used to remind me of how she looked when she first came to visit me , months before we were married . It was a beautiful memory before it faded . <p> I believe in preservation portraits again . <p> Lindy was a special case . She did n't outlive her preservation and her loss was such a shock . <p> But Mariana lives on and on ; I see her face every day in various moods , aging and growing a little sour and impatient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does n't know how the memory sustains me . <p>  --  Leigh Kennedy <p> THE DESERT OF TIME <p> " As time machines go  --  " she sniffed , allowing the first fragment of an expression not pure misery to show through the tears , the sobs , the hysterics she had ground him down with for what seemed hours and hours now  --  " it 's very  --  how do you say ?  --  user friendly .

" What you 're trying to tell me is that I 'm not a very lucky tourist on a fluke vacation from a wife , two kids , and a graduate teaching assistantship in the Painting Department at the University of Utah ; and you 're not from that kibbutz you keep telling me is n't in Israel . But rather  --  now let me get this straight  --  you 're a time traveler from a different planet who  --  " <p> But the tears and the noise of her crying smashed out again at him and she huddled back on the day bed ( even in an inexpensive guest house forty kilometers outside Marrakesh , he had hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in his chest knot to pain , that made a kind of ache pulse low in his throat to a rhythm that was not his heart . When it had begun , he 'd really thought it was some sort of joke , which is why he 'd even bothered to go into it . But now , so much later , she was still sitting there , sobbing  --  and he was still standing there , lost in the ugly vacuity of her crying and , yes , craziness . A beautiful , black-haired girl , he thought , an artist like himself , intelligent , fun  --  and a five-day affair that , he was sure they were both sure , would have no repercussions once she took off to Zimbabwe and later that same afternoon he caught the bus to take him to the ferry that would get him across to Sicily to meet up with Nancy  --  only now , it seemed , she was crazy ! <p> This woman with the perfect English and the charming accent was starkly , ravingly institutionalizable , complete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then his legs began to shake . So he sat down , a little harder than he intended , on the rug by the low teak table with the tarnished brass tray . <p> She was saying ( between the hic-cups that had repeatedly come and gone throughout her upset ) , " A whole different dimensional matrix , " or something like it . And then : " You fool  --  you fool ! " <p> " I thought , " he countered again ( he 'd said it many too many times , already ) , " you 'd like it  --  that you 'd be pleased . Really . I did n't know it would upset you so . " He was sweating : The neck of his light-weight cotton shirt was soaked , and the cloth clung , too , to the small of his back  --  though the single sentence he 'd repeated in each of the letters and postcards he 'd written that week had explained how , because of the dry heat here , you hardly perspired at all . <p> He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tears , after he 'd grown used to feeling helpless , that was all there was to do . Her black hair , fluffy around the little cap she always wore , he 'd thought quite lovely : It was still ... lovely . He knew she did n't pluck her fine eyebrows  --  because , back at home , Nancy did . ( Whatever little problems there 'd been with Nancy , stalled three years now on her master 's thesis , not to mention the kids , there 'd never been anything like this . It was supposed to have been so easy . He really wanted to get back ; it seemed absolutely forever since he 'd seen her . But he was not with Nancy now . He was here . With ... her . He took a breath . ) Her rather long face was  --  yes , intelligent was the word . Not beautiful . Intelligent . Only , now it was puffed and teary , from what , he gathered , checking the ludicrously ornate quartz clock the guest-house manager had hung on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next hour of hysterics . <p> But , again , she was a little quieter . He thought : I can only try once more . " Darling , " he said . He 'd started calling her darling because it sounded kind of thirties , and he was really into noir and stuff ; then it had become habit , the easiest thing to repeat . " I 'm an artist . You showed me those pictures you said you 'd made  --  and I thought you were an artist , too . An artist likes to have his  --  or her  --  pictures seen by people . You said you would like to be famous and known throughout the world  --  you said it would be fun . You had two sets . You said I could look through one . Well , I have this friend who works at one of those slick , fancy American magazines in New York ... with all the advertising ? That beautiful self-portrait you did , of you looking at the picture  --  I just thought I 'd take it and send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . They pay quite well , and everyone can use a little money ... ? It 's just the kind of thing they 'd like . Really . But that 's all . Look , if she writes you that she wants to use it , you can always say no . Or that someone else has already bought it . Or that it was a mistake . Or  --  " <p> " A whole different dimensional matrix ... " she was repeating , shaking her head . <p> " Look , " he said , suddenly , " this business about time machines and the pictures being part of it  --  you look at this one or that one , say the right magic word , and suddenly that 's where you are  --  that 's wonderfully imaginative , darling . But it 's also crazy . That 's ... just not how time machines work ! They have ... dials , and levers and things . Strange chairs inside ornate cabinets that you have to climb into . Test tubes , I think . And bus bars : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> But she was leaning forward , clapping her hands ( again and again ) in a desperately imploring manner . " I was n't going to Zimbabwe , when I left here , " she cried , almost like someone not crying . " I was going to Delft . Seventeenth Century Delft  --  but that does n't matter . How many times have I told you that . I 'm not an artist  --  I 'm just very interested in the art of this very strange , odd and bizarre , bizarre , terribly bizarre world . Oh , please try to understand . The two sets  --  those from one set get me there . I look at it , say the  --  yes , right magic words , that 's what it would seem like to you . And I arrive . Then the second set allows me to leave . Some different words this time . Time machines are n't old fashioned ! They employ a very delicate , very sophisticated technology . But it 's the reproduction : If the pictures are ever reproduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it really was crazy what she was saying , he stood up suddenly , turned , and walked into the next room , thinking : I ca n't take this any more , I ca n't take this , I ca n't , the words coursing through his mind again and again and again . In was not the first time he 'd found himself having to flee her logic or her tears . <p> But  --  in the other room  --  she kept on , trying to explain , once again , her voice low ( because she did n't want the hysterics to overtake her once more ; really , she did n't ) : "  --  the energy is dissipated . That self-portrait was me , leaving here . If it 's ever reproduced , in hundreds , in thousands of copies , even in the future , as long as it 's in the same time line , then the releasing energy is cut by hundreds , by thousands of percent , and I  --  and you and everything around me  --  get trapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , do n't you see , just going around and around , never able to leave it , going through the same time , just before the picture , again and all over again . And we never get out . Oh , I know it sounds impossible . But it is true . It is ! Oh , how many hundreds and thousands and millions of times do I have to tell you it 's true  --  " at which point the full terror of it burst in on her ... again . <p> And  --  again  --  she cried and shook and howled and huddled like some mad desert creature caught in the imported iron jaws of a trap from a wholly alien northern clime and culture . <p> And again in the front room , he took a breath , in his soaking shirt , sat down at the desk ( again ) , and wrote his seven billionth letter explaining that in the dry heat here you did not her . <p>  --  Samuel Delaney <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
