<p> Honiss Webster Cane Jr . learned the art of politics in the 1940s from an entrenched white state senator for whom his father worked . But as a black man in a town that had never sent a black to public office , Cane did not view election as an option . <p> That changed in 1986 , after a voting rights lawsuit led to the creation of a majority-black district for the City Council . Cane , who sells used cars , real estate and burial vaults , easily won a seat that year . Today , he heads the council and has become a political force in Worcester County . <p> Across the rural Eastern Shore of Maryland , black political power , often wielded for the first time as a result of federal voting rights suits filed in the 1980s , has changed the politics of racial exclusion that long prevailed on the eastern side of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge . <p> Along with a first generation of 10 black politicians elected from new majority-black districts , black voters occasionally have opted for whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and white city council members in the county seats of Cambridge and Princess Anne . <p> Leaders of the black community say that running for and winning elective office does not by itself erase long-standing problems such as poverty or job discrimination , especially in tough fiscal times . <p> " One of the things you find out quickly is getting elected to public office only makes you part of the process , " said Lemuel Chester II , the first black commissioner in the history of Dorchester County . " It 's not a panacea . " <p> Isolated from the rest of Maryland until the Bay Bridge opened in 1952 , the Eastern Shore has a long and lingering history of rigid racial segregation and discrimination against black residents in housing , jobs and local institutions such as volunteer fire companies . <p> For years , an at-large system of voting prevalent across the shore resulted in the almost total exclusion of blacks from elective office , despite black populations as large as 39 percent in Somerset County . <p> " The Eastern Shore has n't quite gotten out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who filed many of the lawsuits . <p> To change that , the Department of Justice initiated three lawsuits , the American Civil Liberties Union eight . The suits , filed between 1985 and 1989 , took aim at three counties and eight towns , most of them on the Lower Shore . <p> Activists predicted a sea change in politics from the lawsuits . " There 's no question there 'll be a redistribution of power almost overnight and that 'll bring about great institutional change , " civil rights activist Carl O. Snowden , now an Annapolis alderman , said in 1985 . <p> In each case , the suits led to the abolition of at-large elected governments and the creation of at least one majority-black district . <p> And indeed , since then , black politicians have been elected from districts in the larger municipalities of Easton , Cambridge and Salisbury , and in smaller ones , such as Berlin , Pocomoke City , Snow Hill and Princess Anne . <p> In addition , two black county commissioners were elected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates have been elected , without benefit of lawsuits , under the at-large systems still in place in towns such as Hebron , Denton and Crisfield . <p> Before districting , said Albert Brooks , the first black member of Easton 's City Council , black voters " figured their vote did n't count . But now it 's just a matter of getting people to the polls . " <p> " I talked to a guy who was in World War II . He said he had n't voted since because his vote never made any difference and white folks were gon na do what they were gon na do anyhow , " Brooks said . " I convinced him to go to the polls and vote for me . He did , called me , wished me luck . After that , he had a couple of problems I helped him with . Now , he keeps encouraging me to run for higher office . " <p> Yet , more intractable problems of poverty , poor housing and unemployment remain . The economy has frustrated black as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservatism traditional on the Eastern Shore . " Government should be run like a business , " said Rudolph Cane , Wicomico 's first black commissioner , echoing the views of his older brother , Honiss . <p> Despite such constraints , said the ACLU 's Brown , " The most dramatic thing is blacks are on the inside where decisions are made . Before , they did n't even know what was being discussed . " <p> Newly elected black politicians are beginning to deliver for their constituents . Easton 's Brooks points proudly to a new $ 680,000 storm drain in a black section of the Talbot County seat as " probably my biggest accomplishment . " Wicomico 's Cane said he has had neighborhoods cleaned up and abandoned vehicles removed . <p> But not all has gone as expected by the architects of black political power on the Eastern Shore . <p> Unlike other jurisdictions , Somerset did not settle out of court ; a federal judge ordered the county to abolish its at-large system and set up five districts . The county 's 1st District was drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elect the county 's first black commissioner . <p> James N. Ring , a political neophyte and a white grain and poultry farmer , entered the Democratic primary along with three black candidates . The three black contenders split 53 percent of the vote , resulting in Ring 's 1986 election . <p> The biggest loser , with 6.8 percent , was John Padgett , the plaintiff in the lawsuit that overturned Somerset 's at-large system . <p> Ring 's bid for office had nothing to do with race , he said recently . Instead , it stemmed from his anger at county commissioners for condemning part of his farm for a landfill . In office , he responded to the needs of black constituents , sending highway crews to improve roadside drainage along their rural properties . <p> The district reelected Ring in 1990 , when he received 63 percent of the vote against a single black opponent in the primary and then easily defeated a white Republican in the general election . He plans to run again this year . " I want to keep on working for blacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar outcome in the 1986 election in Princess Anne , population 1,666 , when the town 's first majority-black district chose a white politician over James Mullens , the black plaintiff in the lawsuit against the town . When an additional black district was created , its voters selected another black man to represent them . <p> In both town and county , black voters rejected candidates who had lent their names to the lawsuits , but were not originally from the area . Their status as outsiders worked against them , observers said . <p> Princess Anne was the site of the last lynching in Maryland , in 1933 . The longest National Guard occupation in U.S. history took place in Cambridge . After civil rights protests , troops occupied the Dorchester County seat continuously for 360 days in 1963-64 . <p> Cambridge had elected one black City Council member at-large since the turn of the century ; the creation of districts appeared to ensure the election of two to the city 's five-member council . But residents of the majority-black third ward elected a white woman , Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lemuel Chester , who was indicted on arson charges with activist H. Rap Brown after a 1967 protest in Cambridge erupted into violence and flames , is now in his second term . The arson charges were dropped , and Chester has become part of the system . <p> He has learned to trade votes and often has joined with two commissioners from rural areas that were underrepresented before districting ended the political dominance of populous Cambridge . <p> In Worcester County , which includes the summer resort town of Ocean City , voting rights suits resulted in the election of black Democrats from districts in the small towns of Berlin , Snow Hill and Pocomoke City . <p> But they also served indirectly to energize black voters to help elect , for the first time , a Republican majority to the county commission in 1990 ; indeed , the Republicans  --  all white men  --  won all five seats . <p> They may well owe their election , according to observers of both races , to black support galvanized across the county by Pocomoke City 's Cane . Cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his primary bid for county commissioner in 1990 . <p> " We wiped out the entire incumbent group , " Cane , 60 , boasted . " We wiped out the big-time winners . . . . We 've been able to get some bargaining power . " <p> Cane is the politician whom new county commissioners call before appointing black residents to boards and commissions . <p> " Honiss is a great help in helping us to identify members of the black community with qualifications and interest , " said John E. Bloxom , a county commissioner from Pocomoke City . " We value his input . " <p> Meanwhile , more black residents have been hired for city posts in Pocomoke since his election to the town council . " He is conscious of race when we pass an ordinance , " said Mayor Curt Lippoldt , who is white . " Without Honiss , we 'd be in trouble all the time , just stumbling into it . He 's our hero . " <p> But not everyone 's a fan . Alonzo Schoolfield , a plaintiff in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disenchanted . He wants more action on job discrimination and other social issues . " Anyone can be a councilman , but if they do n't stand on issues that concern the people , it 's of little good , " he said . <p> But then Schoolfield hastened to add , " I believe the fact Honiss is there has to make a difference . That has to give encouragement to someone else . "
