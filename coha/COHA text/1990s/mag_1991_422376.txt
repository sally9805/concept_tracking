Section : World report After a long struggle , this week 's Middle East peace conference is both a triumph and a test for U.S. Secretary of State James Baker <p> Dateline : London ; Jerusalem <p> Secretary of State James Baker had gone over the same ground a dozen times and hoped he had a deal . But instead of agreeing to attend a Mideast peace conference , the four Palestinian representatives who met with Baker in Jerusalem two weeks ago revived old demands . They insisted that Israel stop building settlements in the occupied territories , that an East Jerusalem resident be included in their delegation and that the United States acknowledge their right to self-determination . Any one would scuttle Baker 's carefully crafted conference . He slammed his leather notebook shut and in a voice filled with fury , declared : " You want symbols and I 'm producing a process . If you 're more interested in symbols than you are in the substance then we do n't have much we can do together . ' Says a Baker aide : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leaders and he meant it every time . ' <p> The Mideast peace conference that convenes in Madrid this week is the biggest test yet of Baker 's stewardship of foreign affairs . His eight-month drive to put together the first direct negotiations between Israel and all its Arab neighbors has highlighted Baker 's many strengths : his intellect , his prodigious negotiating skills , his self-discipline and the stamina that carried him more than 100,000 miles , across a half-dozen time zones and through countless dawn-to-midnight negotiating sessions with hard cases like Israel 's Yitzhak Shamir , Syria 's Hafez Assad and the Palestinians . <p> The conference , however , also could expose what many analysts consider Baker 's greatest weaknesses : his lack of vision and his disinterest in grand strategy . " He does n't have an appreciation of history , ' says a senior official who admires Baker . " He responds to the political . It 's ' what can you sell ? ' ' But if the Middle East 's ancient antagonisms are to be set aside now , the United States will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new concepts of justice and security . Tactical maneuvering  --  Baker 's forte  --  can take the process only so far . <p> The conference also could either bury or reinforce one of the nastiest criticisms of Baker : the charge that he ducks the tough ones . Cynics suspect the peace conference will be simply a photo opportunity that Baker will abandon if no breakthroughs are at hand . Aides reject the charge . " This has n't been easy and it certainly has n't been politically safe , ' snaps a top official , noting that Baker 's exertions already have strained relations with Israel and American Jews . " He is n't going to walk away . " <p> Baker had limited international experience but a four-star political resume when George Bush appointed him secretary of state the day after his election . Baker had managed three presidential campaigns  --  for Gerald Ford , Ronald Reagan and Bush . As Reagan 's chief of staff , he restrained some of the administration 's wilder ideological impulses and polished its image  --  and his own  --  in Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan 's second term , the deficit ballooned and the savings and loan industry began to collapse . <p> If Baker was something of an odd man out in the Reagan White House  --  a Texan among Californians , a pragmatist among ideologues  --  now he is the consummate insider . His relationship with Bush dates back to the 1960s , when the two won the doubles tennis championship at the Houston Country Club . Friends say that if Bush had not brought him into his 1970 Senate race after Baker 's first wife died of cancer , Baker might never have left corporate law for politics . If Baker had not taken up politics , Bush might never have become president . The two play at being good old boys , swapping ribald tales as they hunt wild turkeys in the south Texas mesquite and during their daily round of phone conversations . <p> One administration official calls the relationship " big brother*little brother , " a description that suggests both trust and rivalry . In fact , the two men are so close that it is difficult to distinguish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that is intentional : Both men insist on total secrecy from highly centralized staffs and have forbidden the interagency sniping that plagued the Reagan years . More important , it is because they share a worldview . They are pragmatic , nonideological , instinctively prudent  --  Bush out of a native Toryism ; Baker because his political antennae are hypersensitive . <p> Comity can have its price , however . " There 's always a danger of groupthink when two leaders are so alike , ' says a veteran diplomat who says the administration 's support of Saddam Hussein until the invasion of Kuwait was the " worst-case scenario come true . There were a few people blowing the whistle early , but nobody at the top would listen . ' Such a closed system also can become overloaded . " Between State and the White House you have only a few people in the loop . You ca n't run the whole world that way . ' <p> At times , however , the two men have differed , though in their quest for harmony they usually try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be known that he was distressed by the president 's mild response to the Tiananmen Square massacre in China . White House sources say the two also disagreed strongly over using force in the Persian Gulf . Nevertheless , Baker served the president well , using his renowned deal-making skills to craft an international coalition , first for economic sanctions and then for war . <p> So far , the Bush-Baker foreign policy has been undeniably successful . " It 's all turned out remarkably well , ' says Harvard 's Joseph Nye . " But how much is luck and how much is skill is hard to tell . ' With the Soviet empire collapsing , says Nye , " it has been easy to swim with the tide . ' Even Baker 's admirers worry that he lacks the intellectual grounding and the temperament to be a strategic thinker . " Baker simply is n't very interested in foreign policy .. in the historical circumstances or the long-range implications . He 's interested in the deal , what 's doable , ' says a senior official who knows him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mideast peace process , Baker 's aides say his most important accomplishments have been the bipartisan agreement on Nicaragua , the two-plus-four agreement on German unification and the gulf-war coalition . What all three have in common is a pragmatic approach to foreign policy , a strong emphasis on negotiation and a focus that is more mindful of processes than ideas . <p> Ending the partisan wrangling that plagued U.S. policy in Central America was both an act of necessity and a relatively easy task after the years of crippling battles . But making the Soviets a partner in foreign affairs was a gamble that hard-liners in Congress and the administration opposed . Baker , however , was convinced that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and his reform-minded former foreign minister , Eduard Shevardnadze  --  who quickly became one of Baker 's few close friends  --  were ready to end Moscow 's ideological crusade against the West , just as he and Bush were winding down Reagan 's global crusade against communism . <p> Bush and Baker offered the Soviets a greater role in settling Third World quarrels , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy in the Persian Gulf and Central America and now are co-sponsoring the Mideast peace talks . Foreign Minister Boris Pankin even held off renewing diplomatic ties with Israel until he got word that Baker had approved the move and was ready to issue invitations to the peace conference . ( Ironically , U.S. officials wanted the Soviets to go ahead months before , but Gorbachev wanted to give Baker 's peace process the biggest push . ) <p> Despite the Soviets ' obvious weakness , Baker continues to pay Pankin great respect  --  another key aspect of his style . " He never humiliates anyone , since you never know when you 'll have to come back to them , ' says an aide . <p> Bush has often joked that the Mideast peace process would be " a Baker plan " until it succeeded . Clearly , both the White House and the State Department now consider it a success , since both are scrambling for credit . Bush and Baker both believed the gulf war had opened a " window of opportunity , " despite the scoffing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategy of a peace conference . Who bucked up whom when the process stalled is subject to interpretation . But both men share a very different attitude toward Israel from that of any of their predecessors . " Fundamentally they look at it like any other country , ' says a senior administration official . " I 'm absolutely convinced that if Israel were attacked we 'd come to their defense , but there is n't the emotional cord there anymore . ' <p> The senior official says he believes Bush in particular could " have worked harder to reassure Shamir even as he pushed him . ' Baker has been somewhat softer with the Israelis  --  trying to smooth over differences on issues such as housing loan guarantees while the president comes out swinging . Nevertheless , the Israelis say Baker is one of the toughest negotiators they 've ever seen . When Prime Minister Shamir raised a ruckus over Syria 's refusal to attend multilateral talks , Baker turned angry . " If Israel breaks up the talks over this issue , the world wo n't understand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But in a State Department in which only a handful of advisers are " in the loop " and experts and Foreign Service officers are often excluded , Baker 's single-minded focus on the Mideast is also worrisome  --  particularly at a time when the Soviet Union is unraveling . The White House is expected to announce new agricultural credits to help the Soviets make it through the winter . But neither Bush nor Baker has answered a fundamental question : how to balance support for Gorbachev  --  whom they like and who can still deliver on key issues such as arms control  --  against the growing power of local leaders . Soon after the coup , Baker toured the Soviet Union and met with nearly a dozen republic leaders , two mayors and a variety of up-and-coming reformers . " Since nobody knows who will be in charge , he talked to everybody , ' says Soviet expert Stephen Sestanovich of the Center for Strategic and International Studies . Nevertheless , the basic problem remains , he says . " They are still bent on propping up a center which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successes , an assortment of ideologues , critics and even colleagues in the administration still dismiss him as a slick self-promoter , a politico who values little beyond his own success . His most zealous defenders say it is merely jealousy . But other admirers say Baker 's extremely private manner turns some people off . " He 's got humor , but he 's ice when it comes to anything personal , ' says an official who knows him well . Baker 's own zealous aides may bear some of the blame . His small and highly political inner circle almost never admits Baker has made a mistake and works overtime to polish the boss 's image . <p> That is not to say that Baker does n't have political ambitions . He has run for office only once  --  for Texas attorney general in 1978  --  and lost , respectably . He coyly denies that he is thinking of a 1996 presidential campaign , telling reporters that the only running he will do is " a few cows " or talking about relaxing at his Wyoming ranch . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Whether Baker ever makes it to the White House will depend in part on how the Mideast peace process turns out . But there are two bigger questions . Can Baker translate his back-room political prowess into the press-the-flesh warmth a presidential candidate needs ? And can he transform his tactical skills into a vision for a nation losing confidence in its ability to compete in an increasingly unfamiliar world ? <p> Drawing : No caption ( Illustration by Cary Henrie for USN &WR); <p> Picture : No caption ( Chick Harrity-USN &WR); <p> Picture : Convincing Syria .

( AFP ) <p> By Carla Anne Robbins <p> With Kenneth T. Walsh , Robin Knight and David Makovsky <p> FROM MIDEAST TO FAR EAST Next on the Bush-Baker agenda <p> While Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gulf war , the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the Middle East peace process , U.S. policy in the Far East has been on hold . But the Soviet threat in Asia is evaporating , America 's relations with Japan and China are fraying and smaller nations in Asia are worrying that an American retreat would deprive them of a counterweight to Japan 's growing economic power . <p> Bush and Baker now are turning their attention to the Far East as they prepare for trips there in November . In Paris last week to sign an agreement ending 16 years of civil war in Cambodia , Baker took a step toward normalizing relations with Vietnam , Laos and Cambodia . And after leaving China policy largely to Bush , senior officials say , Baker is taking a new interest in sorting out relations with Beijing , which took a nose dive after the bloody 1989 crackdown on China 's democracy movement and could deteriorate further amid continuing human-rights and trade disputes . Finally , Baker believes the United States and Japan need to redefine their relationship now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an identity right now , ' says a senior administration official . " There is a new class emerging that wants to play a more internationalist role . It would be wrong to sit back and not cultivate it . ' <p> The Cambodia settlement declares an immediate cease-fire and provides for United Nations peacekeepers to disarm rival armies , oversee the return of some 350,000 Cambodian refugees and supervise elections to be held by mid-1993 . But Baker is also hoping that ending a conflict that has claimed more than 1 million lives will open the way to reconciling the United States with its former enemies in Southeast Asia . <p> His trademark . Baker 's approach to Vietnam and China reflects the same pragmatic instincts , lack of emotionalism and penchant for negotiation that have characterized both his Mideast peace initiative and his dealings with the Soviet Union . In announcing that the Bush administration is prepared to begin talks with Vietnam as early as next month , Baker indicated that if the Cambodian settlement succeeds  --  and if Hanoi helps resolve the questions about the 2,300 U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared to begin lifting its trade embargo and restoring diplomatic relations . <p> Opening the door to improved relations with Vietnam and trying to approach the Chinese rather than punish them are politically risky moves with uncertain payoffs . But in both cases , Baker is in effect asking of Congress and his countrymen the same thing he is asking of Israel , Syria and the Palestinians : Stop dwelling on the past and do the deals that are possible today . <p> Picture : The boss .
