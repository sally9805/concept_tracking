The rumors of Federico Fellini 's death must have been exaggerated . Surely the wildly contradictory results of last week 's municipal elections were the surreal creation of Italy 's most imaginative film director . Disgusted with 40 years of corrupt governments dominated by centrist parties , voters opted for the extremes  --  recycled communists , neofascists , northern separatists  --  signaling the end of one era while giving no clue to the direction of the new one . The defeat of the mainstream parties seems likely to be repeated when Italians elect a new national Parliament next year . Wrote Eugenio Scalfari , editor of the Rome daily La Repubblica : " A chasm opened , and everything that for 40 years had stood for the center fell into it . " <P> The voter rebellion has been simmering for a long time . Decades of misrule have brought the institutions of government to a state of collapse . In the past 20 months more than 3,000 politicians and businessmen have been implicated in an ever expanding web of billion-dollar kickback and bribery scandals . High taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally driven the normally sanguine Italians into a rage . <P> In last week 's races for mayors and city-council members , the cozy power- sharing coalition anchored by Christian Democrats and Socialists that had held power since the end of World War II fell to ignominious defeat : its candidates won only 14% of the vote countrywide . In search of a party with a stronger message , or perhaps just in revenge for the havoc politicians have wrought on the country , Italians registered their protest by turning to both the far left and the far right . The Northern League , an upstart populist movement centered in Milan , continued to gain power . It has threatened nothing less than the partition of the country into autonomous federations , dividing &lt; the wealthy north from the poor south . The Democratic Party of the Left , formerly the Italian Communist Party , continues to insist that it represents the workers and the poor , but now without Marxist dogma . The neofascists of the Italian Social Movement played to widespread anxiety about public order . But despite their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of noisy skinheads , racists and thugs who remind Italians of the disastrous Fascism of World War II . <P> The voting was so schizophrenic that runoffs will take place next week in many of the major races , often between polar opposites . Only one candidate won outright . Sicilians elected charismatic Leoluca Orlando , 46 , mayor of Palermo , on his promise to drive the Mafia out of Italy .
