A plunge into intercellular soup reveals a mysterious , multipurpose domain <p> At the back of the eye , about 10 droplets of gelatinous fluid separate the deepest layer of the retina from a black lining of pigment-rich cells . This miniature moat  --  thinner than a sheet of cellophane  --  went virtually unnoticed until the 1950s . Recently , however , it has captured the attention of a growing number of researchers , who report tantalizing clues that it plays critical roles in vision . <p> The very location of the moat points to one vital function . The nearest blood supply for the retina 's light-detecting rods and cones lies well beyond it , forcing these cells to receive their nutrients and discard their wastes via the viscous waterway And in order to do their job , the same photoreceptors rely on regular shipments of light-sensitive chemicals across the gel . <p> Medical evidence , too , suggests important roles for the gooey gap , more formally known as the subretinal space or interphotoreceptor matrix . This is precisely where damaged retinas detach , hinting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retina in place . And research into the most common form of inherited blindness  --  a disease called retinitis pigmentosa  --  shows several possible links to defects in the subretinal space . <p> Yet despite such clues , scientists still can not say for sure what goes on there . " It is a region we all know is very important , but we do n't know why or how , " says Matthew M. LaVail , a cell biologist at the University of California , San Francisco ( UCSF ) . <p> For explorers seeking to penetrate this dark continent of the eye , each new discovery seems to spawn new questions . For instance , scientists have found a castle of sorts in the waters of the moat : a spongy network of interlocking macromolecules . Rods and cones protrude into the network 's form-fitting chambers like baby bees embedded in a honeycomb . <p> That discovery , described in 1986 by cell biologists Gregory S. Hageman and Lincoln V. Johnson of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , came as a surprise . Until then , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But surprise turned to astonishment this summer when LaVail and Fumiyuki Uehara reported that in certain rats , the honeycomb sheaths seem to slide , or perhaps shrink , during shifts from darkness to light . <p> Hageman , now at the St. Louis University School of Medicine , argues that the motion may be an illusion , the result of other molecules " masking " the researchers ' view of the sheaths . If it is real , however , the unexpected animation might somehow assist in moving ions , photosensitive chemicals and other substances across the gap , LaVail and Uehara suggest in the June 29 SCIENCE . <p> Scientists know that photosensitive molecules called retinoids  --  chemical cousins of vitamin A  --  embark on mass migrations when lighting changes dramatically Under dark conditions , the rods and cones stockpile these molecules , which remain securely bound there as long as they maintain a certain shape . But when light strikes , the retinoids change shape and spring loose , heading across the subretinal space and into the black lining called the pigment epithelium . Cells in the pigment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reshaped retinoids head homeward again to resume their light-detecting role in rods and cones . <p> LaVail and Uehara suspect that the light-triggered response they saw in the honeycomb sheaths  --  a motion they liken to the parting and closing of curtains  --  helps nudge retinoids back and forth across the moat . <p> Their experiments indicate that the sheath motion is accompanied by a bunching and unbunching of protein molecules that normally bind to retinoids . As the sheaths shift , they might pull the retinoid-laden proteins along with them , LaVail suggests . <p> That hypothesis , if confirmed , might solve a long-standing puzzle . <p> In 1982 , three separate research teams studying the subretinal space 's viscous fluid succeeded in isolating the specialized protein that binds to retinoids . This eagerly sought compound  --  called IRBP , for interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein  --  can ferry retinoids across the moat , says IRBP co-discoverer Alice J. Adler of the Eye Research Institute in Boston . The finding provided the first compelling evidence that specific moat molecules influence the crossing of substances vital to vision , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year suggested that the celebrated protein might slow , rather than speed , the passage of retinoids across the gap . Retinoids might actually cross the moat more rapidly without the protein ferries , assert cell biologists Ming-Tao P. Ho and Joe G. Hollyfield at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston , who tracked retinoid flow between artificial cell membranes in solutions with and without IRBP . They described their experiments in the Jan. 15 , 1989 JOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY . <p> Adler now thinks the proteins might provide a temporary storage depot for retinoids , holding on to them until simple diffusion causes the light-sensitive loads to drift across the moat . Or perhaps the sheath motion carries them along . But all of this remains speculation . " Everything is open here , " Adler stresses . " Nothing is set in stone . " <p> Equally enigmatic is the honeycomb hugging the photoreceptor cells of the retina . Many scientists suspect that it constantly disintegrates and re-grows . Indeed , experimental results hint that this regeneration process , combined with the honeycomb 's elasticity , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " acts like a rubber sheet if you pull on it , " Hollyfield explains . When tugged at one corner , it gives a little throughout . By providing a flexible link from cell to cell , it might tether the photoreceptors together along the curving inner wall of the eye while aiming each at the best angle to catch light , Hollyfield and others suggest . <p> One might expect the form-fitting sheaths to restrict the movement of the photoreceptors they encase . But Jay M. Enoch , a biophysicist at the University of California , Berkeley , has demonstrated in humans that cone cells can change their orientation considerably . <p> Enoch chemically dilated volunteers ' pupils and fitted them with contact lenses coated with a false " iris " encircling an equally false , off-center " pupil . " After three days , tests showed that many of the cones had realigned themselves to point in the direction of the misplaced light source . Enoch , who reported these results in 1981 , now plans an experiment to see how photoreceptors respond to two out-of-place pupils . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' new alignment through regeneration , replacing old sheaths with new ones pointing toward the false pupil . But where do the replacement materials come from , and where do the discarded materials go ? So far , attempts to trace the origin of the honeycomb 's interlocking macromolecules have proved inconclusive . Moreover , as Hollyfield puts it , " we do n't know who uses up the unwanted matrix . " <p> Why does scientific uncertainty hover so thickly around this paper-thin gap ? For one thing , the subretinal space contains an unexpected bonanza of substances and structures . It 's like a bottomless suitcase : The more you try to unpack it , the more new contents it seems to yield . <p> Most recently , researchers have come across " large quantities " of a substance called basic fibroblast growth factor ( bFGF ) in the gel . Hageman , who announced the discovery in July at the Stockholm ( Sweden ) Symposium on Retinal Degeneration , says this suggests two more functions for the gel : retinal repair and cell differentiation . <p> In skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers , " waiting to rush to the assistance of injured cells . In the retina , the growth hormone might also serve as a toner to help still-healthy photoreceptors stay in functional shape , he proposes . Both rods and cones  --  whose cell membranes carry receptors for bFGF  --  show dramatic structural and functional differences from one end to the other . This polarization is critical to their light-sensing function . In order to maintain it , says Hageman , the cells might depend on cues from bFGF molecules docked at their receptors . Such signals might " keep the rods and cones from changing into little round cells " that could no longer detect light , he suggests . <p> The technical difficulties of probing the gel have also hampered investigators . The nearly transparent fluid played hide-and-seek with early retina researchers : Although they first glimpsed it in 1855 , scientists debated its existence for the next 50 years . Another half-century passed before biologists developed the necessary chemical stains to reveal some of its contents . Today , the scant amount of gel obtainable from an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior in vivo continue to frustrate efforts to clarify the gap 's functions . " It does n't give up its secrets very easily " Hollyfield says . <p> Explorers continue to make headway ' however . Recently , they have dismantled the honeycomb walls  --  around the cones , at least  --  in hopes of resolving a sticky issue . Since the late 1960s , scientists have hypothesized that the viscous blend in the subretinal space somehow glues the retina to the underlying pigment epithelium , but the specific anchoring sites remained elusive . Several studies now point to cone sheaths as the likely candidate . <p> The sheaths of the honeycomb network keep a firm grip on the rods and cones they encase . And at the other side of the moat , twisted strands extend from the pigment epithelium and screw themselves into cone-containing sheaths . ( Rod sheaths show little evidence of such attachment . ) Researchers have also detected a number of glue-like molecules near the anchoring strands . <p> To test the adhesion hypothesis , Hageman and Howard S. Lazarus of St. Louis University disrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ xyloside  --  a sugar known to inhibit synthesis of the main macromolecule in these sheaths . This caused the retina to detach from the pigmented lining , they report . Their finding , presented at the Stockholm symposium in July , indicates that the cone sheaths not only hold the retina in place , but also require constant renewal from whatever source manufactures the macromolecules , Hageman says . <p> Hageman launched a second chemical assault in a study conducted with XiaoYing Yao and Michael E. Marmor of Stanford University . In test rabbits , the researchers injected the subretinal gap with enzymes that selectively degrade cone sheaths . In control rabbits , they injected a nondegrading fluid . The control rabbits ' retinas remained attached except at the point of injection . But in the test rabbits , a widening circle of cone-sheath disintegration and retinal detachment grew outward from the injection site over a three-day period , the team found . A report on their work will appear in the October INVESTIGATIVE OPHTHALMOLOGY AND VISUAL SCIENCE . <p> Scientific interest in the miniature moat continues to grow as new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now we have a critical mass " of researchers focusing on the subretinal gap , Hollyfield says . <p> Many are particularly intrigued by LaVail 's report of shifting rod sheaths . To Hollyfield , that phenomenon implies that materials in the subretinal space " are very actively involved somehow in the functioning of the photoreceptors themselves . " Confirmation of such involvement , he says , might even change the way researchers approach the physiology of vision in general . <p> " Physiologists are going to have to start thinking about more than what is in the retinal cell , " Hollyfield says . " They are going to have to start thinking about what is outside the cell if they want to have a full understanding of photoreceptor function . " <p> DIAGRAM : At the very back of the retina , the moat-like subretinal space ( black zone in diagram ) surrounds the light-sensing rods and cones ( white bars ) .

Weiss <p> Retinitis pigmentosa : Filling an information gap <p> Clumsy fielding in a twilight Little League game , or a " careless " bike accident at dusk , could offer the first clues . Retinitis pigmentosa  --  a hereditary disease affecting about 100,000 people in the United States  --  typically begins by eroding night vision during childhood or adolescence . Tunnel vision or complete blindness commonly follows as the retina , for no known reason , slowly degenerates . <p> The search for a treatment or cure has drawn a blank . However , efforts to determine the cause of the disease are beginning to pay off . Molecular biologists this year located genes associated with some forms of the disease . And researchers studying the subretinal space at the back of the eye have uncovered other potentially important leads . <p> The retina coats the curving back wall of the eye like a transparent layer cake consisting of different cell types . Directly behind it lies the gel-filled subretinal gap , and behind that lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigment-rich cells . Retinitis pigmentosa destroys the photoreceptor cells that protrude into the subretinal space from the retina 's hindmost layer . The rod cells usually go first , sometimes followed by the cones . Of ten , the pigment epithelium also deteriorates . <p> Scientists have speculated that 20 to 30 different hereditary disorders fall under the heading of retinitis pigmentosa . These range from barely perceptible ( and frequently undiagnosed ) loss of vision to potentially deadly syndromes with symptoms such as blindness , deafness and mental retardation . <p> Investigators of retinitis pigmentosa take great interest in the narrow space between the retina and the pigment epithelium . Indeed , organizations seeking cures for blindness , including the National Eye Institute and the National Retinitis Pigmentosa Foundation , frequently fund studies of the subretinal space in hopes of better understanding retinal disease and eventually finding a way to fight it . Accumulating evidence from such research indicates the gap is important to retinal function in general , and possibly to retinal degeneration in particular . <p> In 1981 , cell biologist Matthew M. LaVail and his co-workers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestive and possibly causal link between changes observed in the subretinal space and a subsequent death of photoreceptor cells . In rats with a form of hereditary retinal degeneration , they found that the gap accumulated an unusual buildup of photoreceptor fragments . ( In normal rats , such fragments slough off daily but are immediately digested by the pigment epithelium . ) The buildup of undigested fragments began as much as a week before photoreceptors started to die . LaVail and others continue to investigate why the debris piles up and how its accumulation might harm photoreceptors . <p> This year , he and Fumiyuki Uehara presented two new findings . Normal rats show a shifting motion in the photoreceptor-hugging sheaths that permeate the subretinal space , apparently triggered by changes in lighting , they reported in the June 29 SCIENCE . In rats with the inherited disease , however , the shifting ceased as retinal degeneration progressed . Uehara reported the latter finding last spring in Sarasota , Fla. , at a meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology . <p> Uehara , now at Kagoshima @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degeneration at best only loosely approximates retinitis pigmentosa in humans . Still , he ventures , " if we can inhibit this loss of response , it may be useful for preventing the progression of retinal degeneration. "  --  P. L. Weiss <p>
