No one better personified the vitality of the American Dream in the second half of the 20th century than Sam Walton . A scrappy , sharp-eyed bantam rooster of a boy , Walton grew up in the Depression dust bowl of Oklahoma and Missouri , where he showed early signs of powerful ambition : Eagle Scout at an improbably young age and quarterback of the Missouri state-champion high school football team . He earned money to help his struggling family by throwing newspapers and selling milk from the cow . After graduating from the University of Missouri , he served in the Army during World War II . Then , like millions of others , he returned home in 1945 to earn a living and raise a family in an uncertain peacetime economy . <P> Over the decades that followed , the way America worked and lived changed profoundly , and Walton found himself at the center of much of that change . He possessed a gift for anticipating where things were headed , and he probably understood the implications of the social and demographic currents that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone else in business . That acumen hastened his rise from humble proprietor of a variety store in the little Delta cotton town of Newport , Ark. , to largest retailer in the world and richest man in America . <P> When Walton died in 1992 , with a family net worth approaching $25 billion , he left behind a broad and important legacy in American business as well as a corporate monument . Wal-Mart stores is the No. 4 company in the FORTUNE 500 , with annual sales of close to $120 billion , ranking behind only General Motors , Ford and Exxon . <P> At the risk of oversimplifying a rather complex business phenomenon , it can be said that the easiest way to grasp the essence of what Sam Walton meant to America is to read his ad slogan emblazoned on all those Wal-Mart trucks you see barreling down highways around the country : WE SELL FOR LESS , ALWAYS . Walton did not invent discount retailing , just as Henry Ford did n't invent the automobile . But just as Ford and his cars revolutionized America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounting revolutionized the country and its service economy . Walton did n't merely alter the way much of America shopped ; he changed the philosophy of much of American business , instigating the shift of power from manufacturer to consumer that has become prevalent in industry after industry . <P> Though it 's hard to believe today , discount retailing was a controversial concept when it began to gain ground in the ' 50s at stores such as Ann &; Hope , which opened in a reclaimed mill in Cumberland , R.I. Traditional retailers hated it , and so did manufacturers ; it threatened their control of the marketplace . Most states had restrictions on the practice . <P> When the business began to emerge in the early ' 60s , Walton was a fairly rich merchant in his 40s , operating some 15 variety stores spread mostly around Arkansas , Missouri and Oklahoma . They were traditional small-town stores with relatively high price markups.
