Missing Pieces <p> " CUT ME A PIECE OF two-inch pipe twenty-seven inches long , " Mark yelled from the trench , " and hurry up . " <p> Jennifer breathed a relieved sigh . For two days she had been cutting the three-inch diameter pipe , which was hard to hold while the jagged teeth of the handsaw tore mercilessly into its smooth black plastic surface . Handing him the pipe , she pointed across at two pipes sticking up out of the dirt . <p> " What are those two pipes for ? " He looked up and followed her pointing finger . <p> " One 's the kitchen sink , the other 's the laundry . " <p> " But how do you know that they are and where they 're coming from ? " He stopped his movements abruptly and looked up at her . <p> " What year are you ? " he asked frankly . " I just finished my second year , " she answered , made a little nervous by the question . <p> " You mean you 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know what we 're doing here ? Where the hell have you been working ? " <p> commercial mostly , " she defended herself , " hanging cast iron pipe for second-story fixtures . I have n't worked much residential . " <p> " Well , did n't they teach you anything ? " He was incredulous . <p> She had learned how to measure and cut cast iron pipe , but it had been almost a year before anyone let her take her own measurements . <p> She had hoped that Mark might be another Chuck Johnson , that he might say , " Stick with me , I 'll teach you everything I know . " Chuck Johnson was the only man she 'd worked for who seemed not to notice her awkwardness or ignorance . At the beginning , she had n't known a tool from a fitting . Chuck was the only man who seemed to understand that she had no context at all for what he was trying to teach her but taught her anyway . So , she tolerated his personal questions . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is too much for a woman ? " or " Do n't your kids miss you not being home to cook for them ? " He also made jokes with other guys about the new 36-year-old apprentice ; she never admitted it was her . And then she had been snatched away from him , too soon , and sent to other jobsites . <p> Mark was looking at her expectantly . <p> " Yeah , they did , " was all she could manage in that instant . She had been vaguely prepared for this question somewhere down the road , and now she realized with anxiety she had no idea how much she was supposed to know . She had started with ignorant eyes at the isometric drawing Mark and tossed at her feet that morning . That drawing , with its myriad lines angling and jutting out in all directions with tiny little numbers signifying measurements , was designed to give an accurate picture of what this plumbing system should look like . It had answers , she knew , to many questions , because she had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were working . They had the keys she so desperately needed , and they seemed determined to withhold them from her . <p> Called " Easy Money " by any number of tradesmen who thought she got the easy jobs , and " Josephine " by a plumber who could n't stand to have her around - let alone train her - unless he could call her that , she had always done what she was told , had expected that would suffice - for how long ? And now Mark 's probing question had cracked open a fissure in her distorted perception : he 'd simply asked her to justify her presence there . <p> " I 've drilled lots of holes and cut lots of pipe , " she started weakly , " and I 've helped put in water and gas pipe , too , but I ... " <p> " But you never got to the part where you know why you 're doing what you 're doing , " he finished for her . She nodded . <p> " In other words , all you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , " she conceded . <p> " Well , that is the hardest part , " he seemed reluctant to admit . " Anybody can shove in pipe when there are places to put it . But what I ca n't figure out is how come , in two years , you did n't make them tell you what was going on ? " He was shaking his head and climbing out of the trench . <p> She backed out of his way , staring at him blankly ; she had tried that once . She had gone up against the men she was assigned to that first day of her apprenticeship , and their jarring harsh words reverberated off the thin walls of her skull even now : " We ai n't got to show you shit . " And they had walked away , leaving her standing there , insufficiently armed with her 105 pounds of determination to learn and the illusion that she had a right to . <p> " Damn , " Mark said , scratching his head . " Now , listen , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you being a woman and all , and a black one at that ; but you better learn this shit , and fast , or they wo n't keep you around . And I sure do n't have time to train you . " He nodded over her shoulder , " You see Joe over there ? He 's watching me , and I got ta get this shit done and move on to the next one , or they wo n't be keeping me , either . Do you know how many guys are on the out-of-work list ? So you better pick up that drawing and study it hard . " And he walked away . <p> She felt absolutely helpless . It was a feeling that had recurred often during her apprenticeship ; she remembered the first " worst " time .... <p> IT WAS THE MIDDLE of the November rainy season when she got the call . They needed a green apprentice at an immense concrete and steel building under construction in the valley . She was later to learn that they 'd also needed a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman was icing on the cake . <p> She had been assigned to Ron , who 'd said to her offhandedly , " Come on , we have to go get some four-inch cast iron pipe ; we 'll take the truck . " <p> The " truck " was an old , beat-up , rusted , 1930 's vintage that had the stick in the steering column and was impossible to shift into second gear . They must have been saving it for just this type of atmosphere : rain , thick much , trash and rough men . She was surprised it made it the two hundred yards over the bumpy , muddy terrain to where the pipe was stacked , but she was sure it would n't make it back with a load . <p> When she alighted from the truck , she sloshed through the mud to one end of the ten-foot length of pipe he was starting to pick up and reached for it . <p> " No , " he stopped her , " you grab your won . " <p> Surprised but determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lifted one end . She struggled , faltered , then got her shoulder under the end , panting heavily ; she had never experienced this kind of weight on her body . <p> He had already dumped his in the truck and was back , reaching for another , but stopped and instructed her . <p> " Push it up off your shoulder into the air and walk toward the middle , then get your shoulder under it and lift the front end . " <p> THIS TIME HE stood and watched her struggle . She started to lift the front end and immediately felt her knees , back and shoulders plead for relief from their immense burden . Her entire body was trembling from the weight , and she could feel herself slowly but undeniably sinking . When she looked down , mud was curling up over the toes of her work boots . With an angry grunt , she tried to get the front end higher so that it would be level with the back end ; but her body had not kept pace with her will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop back into the thick sludge . She looked at him expectantly . He seemed instantly to grasp her intention , for he said abruptly , " You see that trailer over there ? " He pointed to a miniature-looking trailer about five hundred yards in the distance , the foremen 's trailer . <p> " If they see me , " he continued dryly , " Out here helping you , then one of us is gon na get fired . " He hoisted his pipe , sloshed over to the truck , dumped it , and leaned against the truck to watch her . <p> Her ears were burning with rage . It was a commingling of pride , anger , pain and frustration that determined what she was able to do in the next few moments . She stood , finally . The monstrous , stiff beast level on her shoulder , her entire body was trembling . Her feet stuck in three inches of mud . She watched his face ; he seemed to be trying to mask his surprise . She realized that if she lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she would have to repeat this nightmare three more times , so she pushed for her limits . As soon as she freed her right foot , it seemed to slam , of its won accord back into the thick mind ; but , she noted quickly , about one foot ahead of where it had been , for she saw the traces of the old footprint before it was swallowed up in the soup . <p> So in this slow , methodical but triumphant manner , she made it over to the truck ten feet away , dumped the front end and then slowly lifted and pushed , lifted and pushed until the other five feet of the miserable load was off her . Her body was becoming numb , a blessing that allowed her to repeat the ritual in zombie-like fashion , collapsing only when she hit the luxurious seat of that glorious mechanical mule . <p> But the ride back seemed unjustly short : they never once got stuck in the mud ! And before she could contemplate what was next in store , he bounded out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to unload it and carry it down the hall . " And he snatched up a length of pipe . <p> She was in shock . Had n't she just proved to him that she could do it ? Had n't that been the whole point ? She was beginning to see clearly the end of a very brief career , for this would surely break her . But then she heard her own voice , weak but audible , as she leaned , exhausted , against the truck , having made only a faint gesture to reach for the pipe . <p> " I 'm not gon na do it , " she mumbled . <p> He must have been watching and listening , for no sooner had she said it than he was standing right before her , his body bent to her height , his eyes widened , an expression of disbelief on his face . <p> " What did you say ? " His tone was not demanding but simply curious . <p> " I said , I 'm not gon na do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na hurt myself for you or anybody else , so you might as well just lay me off now . " <p> AND THEN SHE heard him fairly shout . <p> " You what ? " He seemed barely able to articulate his incredulity . " Did I hear you say you ca n't do it ? Is that what you said ? You ca n't do it ? " <p> " Yes ! " she shouted back , " yes , yes ! " At that moment he stumbled backward , nearly doubling over , a huge roar of laughter bursting from his taut face . She did not understand . <p> " Wait 'll I tell my wife , " he bellowed louder , and slapped his thing . " Just wait 'll I go home and tell my wife you just proved women ca n't cut it out here ! " <p> She had not been able to see the picture clearly enough or soon enough , then or now .... <p> FOR THE NEXT TWO hours she followed Mark around silently , stealing glances at the mysterious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fittings to his new location when she spotted Gary London , the project manager , walking toward her from across the field . He handed her a white envelope . <p> " Here 's your check , " he said softly . " Sorry , but we ca n't use you ; you just do n't know enough for a third-year apprentice . If you like , you can leave now so you can make it to the union hall to check in . It 's really to bad that you did n't get better training . " He turned abruptly and walked away . <p> Salt : her mouth was full of it , stinging and burning ; it was everywhere , behind her eyes , in her ears . She turned and offered a blubbery , " Thanks for trying to warn me , " to Mark , picked up her lunch pail and-headed for the car . <p> What could she tell her children ? This layoff was not because of lack of work ; this smelled too distinctly of failure . The solitary drive allowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried her on its waves . <p> So , with placid resignation she checked in at the dispatcher 's counter to request placement on the out-of-work list . <p> MOMENTS LATER , she found herself walking down the darkened corridor that led to the school coordinator 's office . His door was open , and she peeked in . <p> " Hi , Bill , " she said . He looked up . <p> Oh , hi , Jennifer , what 's up ? " <p> " I just got laid off , " she confessed inadvertently . <p> " Well , you know , a lot of those companies ca n't afford to keep you around when they 're running out of work . " <p> " No , " she corrected him frostily , " I mean I got laid off cause I did n't know enough . " <p> Oh ? " He seemed at a loss . <p> " Tell me something , " she was looking at him squarely , " how much is a second-year , or even a third-year apprentice , supposed to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he scratched his head , " some companies just want cheap labor ; then again other companies just have their journeyman take the apprentice under their wing , it 's hard to ... " <p> " Wait a minute , " she blurted loudly , " are you telling me nobody knows how much anyone is supposed to know at any given time ? That 's insane ! " <p> " Now , hold on , " he tried to calm her , " what 's the problem ? " <p> " That dammed Gary London said I did n't know enough , " she fumed . <p> " Well , what kind of work were you doing ? " <p> " I do n't know ; laying some pipes in the ground , and there were some pipes sticking up , and there was this drawing , and I 'd never seen any of it before and did n't know what it was for and ... " <p> " OK , OK , just calm down , " he leaned back in his chair . <p> " There are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are . I never got to start from the beginning cause there was no first-year class , remember ? You just dumped me in a second-year class and I was too intimidated to ask any questions ; and anyway , I did n't even know what questions to ask . So now I have this huge gap in my understanding , and nobody gives a damn . " She plopped down in a chair . " I always thought I would pick it up on the jobs , but I think you know those guys do n't plan to teach a woman any more than they can get away with . " <p> " OK , OK , " he was still calm , " let me ask you this : do you know what a plan-view of drawing is ? " <p> " Yes , it 's as if you 're looking down at the floor from the ceiling . " <p> " All right , pull your chair around here . I 'm gon na draw a plan-view of a bathroom , the toilet , tub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines . " He sketched quickly . " Now you know the sewer line is in the street . So connect your building sewer to all the fixtures , then take it to the street , and use the right fittings , you know , combos and 45 and 90 degree bends . " He watched her sketch . OK , good ; now where are the vents ? " <p> " What vents ? ' <p> He looked at her earnestly . " Well , now , that 's been part of the problem . You did n't know that every fixture has to be vented through the roof for air . Here , let me show , you , " <p> " Why are you drawing lines over to there ? " she asked . <p> " Because this pipe 's in the middle of the room , and even though it 's under the floor , I need to run it over to the closest wall I can come up in . " <p> " You mean the vents are part of the sewer line until they come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he smiled . " I see why none of it made any sense to you , and I 'm really surprised no one has showed you even this much . It 'll make even more sense when I explain the rest . " He seemed enthusiastic in the telling of it . " That 's why residential work is the best place to start ; you get to see the complete picture from start to finish , and that 's what you never got . " <p> And for the next three hours he answered her questions , questions she had never before been able even to formulate . <p> Article copyright Tradeswomen , Inc . <p> Article copyright Tradeswomen , Inc . <p> Photo ( Missing pieces of a pipe ) <p>
