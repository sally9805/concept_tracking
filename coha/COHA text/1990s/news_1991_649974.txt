##@x <p> No issue is more important to New York City 's future than the performance of its public schools . The economy can not prosper without a well-educated labor force , the city 's huge immigrant population can not be assimilated without good schools and more middle-class families will flee if they think the schools are inferior or dangerous . <p> There is some reason for concern . Test scores are improving slightly , but still only equal the average for the rest of the state . The physical plant was allowed to deteriorate ; only since 1987 has there been a coherent building plan . And budget cuts this year have stripped away hundreds of teachers and counselors , forcing crowded classrooms , reduced course offerings and shortages . <p> But the city 's schools are not plummeting toward catastrophe . Indeed , by some performance measures , they have at least held their own and may actually have improved over the last 20 years . <p> What has changed most dramatically is the demands imposed by society . The schools must now educate a population that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in English than 20 years ago . And they must prepare students for jobs that require far more skills than ever before . The schools have to run a lot faster just to keep pace with the new demands . <p> The school system is the largest in the nation , dauntingly large : a $7 billion budget , 980,000 students , 984 schools , 63,500 teachers , 22,600 principals , counselors and other supervisors and 3,600 administrators . The racial balance has changed . In 1967 , half the school population was white . Now , in a city that 's 43 percent white , white pupils represent 19 percent of the population , blacks 38 percent , Hispanics 35 percent and Asians and others 8 percent . <p> In addition , the system must grapple with privation . A third of the students come from welfare families and 60 percent live in single-parent households . About 110,000 students are enrolled in classes for limited English proficiency . The schools are much more dangerous than 20 years ago , although the number of serious incidents last year , 3,843 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems , students are performing better . Overall attendance in 1990-91 , at nearly 87 percent , was the highest in 24 years . Reading and math scores showed slight improvements . And students are staying in school longer . <p> But that 's not enough . Students need ever-more sophisticated skills to compete successfully for jobs in this information-based economy . That 's why the system must meet the challenge of providing a better education to a needier population . <p> How can that be done ? The first answer is more resources . The city now spends about $7,100 per pupil , 10 percent under the state average . Maximum class sizes , 32 for elementary schools and 34 for high schools , are higher than in many districts ; and even those limits are often breached . <p> The schools are entitled to more state funds . With 37 percent of the state 's students , and an even higher proportion of its needy students , the city schools get only 33 percent of state education aid . The difference amounts to $485 million this year . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More money could provide a longer school day and year and expand pre-kindergarten programs , after-school activities and services for children from troubled families . <p> Schools need more autonomy . Schools Chancellor Joseph Fernandez advocates more authority for individual schools , with principals , teachers and parents sharing power . The idea is to let teachers and principals innovate and to encourage parental involvement . It 's a promising idea , but schools need more responsibility for budgets , curriculum and hiring . In exchange for more power , teachers could accept more training and less protection for incompetents . And parents ought to have more opportunity to choose schools . <p> The system needs a stronger curriculum , of just the sort Mr. Fernandez is pushing by increasing math and science requirements . <p> The system needs authority over custodians . In the past , custodians have been allowed to charge " opening fees " to outside groups using schools and avoid doing routine repairs . Lately , the Board of Education has got tougher with the custodians ' union , and just last week Mr. Fernandez said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unreasonable demands . <p> New York City has come back from distress before , usually to new triumphs of commerce and culture , transforming neighborhoods , industries and people . The future now , as in the past , depends on the schools . @@649974 The first time Richard hit me I saw stars in front of my eyes just like they do in cartoons . It was just a backhand , though  --  not like when I saw Tommy Bucksmith 's dad wallop him so hard that when he hit the pavement his head actually bounced . I s'pose Richard did n't know about the flips I used to do with Daddy where you face each other and while you 're holding on to your daddy 's hands you climb up his legs to right above the knees and then push off , through the triangle that your arms make with his . It 's super fun . I was just trying to show Richard how it works . Anyway , I learned then and there to stay clear of Richard . I try to stay away from home as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get lost in a town called Toast . <p> That 's where I live : Toast , North Carolina . I do n't know how it is anywhere else but here all the streets are named for what 's on them . There 's Post Office Road and Front Street , which takes you past the front of the stores , and Back Street , which is one street over  --  in back of them . There 's New Church Road , even though the church that sits at the end of it is n't new anymore . There 's Brown 's Farm Road , which is where Hollis Brown lives with his family , and before him came other Browns who Momma knew and did n't like all that much , and Hilltop Road and even River-bend Road . So wherever you set out for , the street signs will lead the way . I live on Murray Mill Road , and I s'pose if you did n't know any better you 'd think my last name 's Murray , but it 's Parker  --  Mr. Murray passed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thing about the Murray house : the way in from Route 74 is just grass growing up between two straight lines so your tires 'll know exactly where to go . The first thing you see after you 've been driving till the count of sixty is the mill barn that 's being held up over the pond by old stilts . We still have the board with peeling painted letters that says No Fishing on Sunday nailed up to the tree on the edge of the pond . Just to the side of that , taking up a whole outside wall of the mill , is Mr. Murray 's old sign that shows a cartoon rooster cock-a-doo-dle-doing the words Feed NutrenaBe Sure , Be Safe , Be Thrifty . It 's getting hard to read the words of the poster now that a fine red dust from the dirt outside the mill has settled over it top to bottom . But you can see the rooster clear as day . Tacked up to the door of the old mill is this : " WARNING : It is unlawful for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer for sale any adulterated or misbranded grain . Maximum penalty $100 fine or 60 days imprisonment or both . " I copied that down in my notebook from school . <p> " Whoa ! " The notebook goes flying out of my hands into the dirt . <p> " Betcha did n't see that coming ! " Richard laughs at me as I scramble to pick it up before he gets ahold of it . " Must be something pretty important , you grabbing at it like that . Lemme see there , " and he pulls it out of my hands before I can make a squeak about it . <p> " Give it back . " <p> " ' Collie McGrath is n't talking to me on account of the frog incident ' what 's the frog incident ? " He looks up from my diary . <p> " Give it back ! " But when I go to try to get it back he shoves me away , flipping through the pages , scanning each one with his dirty finger . " Where am I ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Hmm , " more flipping , " Momma this , Momma that . Jesus H. Christ , nothing about your dear ole dad ? " <p> He throws it back down to the ground and I 'm mad I did n't listen to my own self when I thought I should n't reach down to pick it up until he leaves , ' cause when I do bend down again he shoves me into the dirt with his boot . " There ! Gave ya something to write about ! " I live here with my stepfather , Richard , my momma , and my sister , Emma . Emma and I are like Snow White and Rose Red . That 's probably why it 's our favorite bedtime story . It 's about two sisters : one has really white skin and yellow hair ( just like Momma ) and the other one has darker skin and hair that 's the color of the center of your eye ( that 's just like me ) . My hair changes colors depending on where you 're standing and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks purple-black , but from the back at night it 's like burned wood in the fireplace . When it 's clean , Emma 's hair is the color of a cotton ball : white , white , white . But usually it 's so dirty it looks like the dusty old letters Momma keeps in a shoe box on her closet shelf . <p> Richard . Now there 's a guy who is n't like anyone we 've read about at bedtime . Momma says he 's as different from Daddy as a cow from a crow , and I believe her . I mean , would n't you have to be likable to make everyone line up to buy carpet from you like Momma says they did for Daddy ? Richard 's not half as likable . I told Momma once that I thought Richard was hateable , but she did n't think it was funny so she sent me to my room . A few days later , when Richard was back picking on Momma she yelled out that no one liked him and that his own stepdaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just stood there listening to the tick-tick-tick of the plastic daisy clock we have hanging in the kitchen , knowing it was too late to run . <p> Momma says our daddy was the best carpet salesman in the state of North Carolina . He must 've sold a ton of carpet because there was n't any left for us . We have hard linoleum . After he died Momma let me keep the leaf-green sample of shag that she found in the back seat of his car when she was cleaning it out before Mr. Dingle took it away . The sample must 've fallen off the big piece of cardboard that had lots of other squares on it in different colors so folks could match it to their lives better . I keep it in the drawer of the white wicker night table by my bed in an old cigar box that has lots of colorful stickers of old-fashioned suitcases , stamps and airplanes ( only on the cigar box they 're spelled aeroplanes ) slapped on every which way . Sometimes if I sniff into that shag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet smell that followed Daddy around like a shadow . <p> Back to me and Emma . Our hair is different colors but our skin is where you see the biggest difference . Chocolate and vanilla difference . Emma looks like someone got bored painting her and just left her blank for someone else to fill in . Me ? Well , Miss Mary at White 's Drugstore always tilts her head to the side and says , " You look tired , chile , " when she sees me , but I 'm not  --  it 's just the shadows under my eyes . <p> I 'm eight  --  two years older than Emma , but because I 'm small people probably think we 're mismatched twins . And that 's the way we think of each other . But I wish I could be more like Emma . I scream when I see a cicada , but Emma does n't mind them . She scoops them up and puts them outside . I tell her she should just step on them but she does n't listen to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once , Tommy Bucksmith twisted her arm around her back and held it there for a long time ( " until you say I 'm the best in the universe " he told her at the time , laughing while he winched her arm backward higher and higher ) and she did n't make a peep . Emma 's not scared of anything . Except for when Richard turns on Momma . Then we both go straight to behind-the-couch . Behind-the-couch is like another room for me and Emma . It 's our fort . Anyway , we usually head there when we 've counted ten squeaks from the foot pedal of the metal trash can in the kitchen . The bottles clank so loud I think my head 'll split in two . <p> Richard starts bugging Momma after about the tenth squeak . I do n't know why Momma does n't stay out of his way from squeak eight on but she does n't . Me and Emma , we 've started a thing we call the floor shimmy where , when we hear squeak eight we start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the TV toward behind-the-couch . With the volume up you ca n't hear us , and Richard 's concentrating real hard on Momma so he does n't notice that we 're inching toward behind-the-couch . By squeak nine , we 're about two Barbie-doll lengths from the front of the couch , and just before squeak ten we 're sliding between the cool paint on the wall and the nubby brown plaid back of the couch . We used to think it was stinky behind-the-couch , but we do n't even notice it anymore . I brought some of Momma 's perfume there once and squirted it twice right into the fabric so now it smells just like Momma on Sunday . <p> We live in an old white house with chipping yellow shutters . It 's three floors high , if you count the attic where me and Emma sleep . We used to have our own room across the hall from Momma and Daddy 's room , but after he died and Richard moved in we had to go up another floor . But here 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cai n't even think about that right now . When I do n't want to think about something I just pretend there 's a little man in my head who takes the part of my brain that 's thinking the bad thing and pushes on it real hard so it goes to the back of all the other things I could be thinking about . <p> Momma says it 's trashy to have stuff out front of our house like we do so she goes and plants flowers in some of it so it 'll look like we 've got it there on purpose . Here 's what we 've got : three tires  --  one of them has grass already growing from the pile of dirt that 's in the middle of it ; a cat statue that 's gray like a sidewalk ; Richard 's old car that he says will come back to life one of these days , but when it does I think it 'll be confused since it does n't have any tires on it ; Momma 's old tin washtub with flowers planted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in when we were really young , but now one side 's all frayed because we never took it inside in the winter ; a bale of hay that smells bad on account of rain rot ; a metal rooster that points in the direction of a storm if one 's coming ; and Richard 's old work boots . Momma up and planted flowers in them , too . I 've never seen flowers in boots before , but she did it and sure enough there 're daisies pushing up out of them right this minute . Oh , I almost forgot , Momma 's clothesline is out there , too . <p> We do n't have a front walk to get to the door to the house . I wish we did . Snow White and Rose Red have a front walk that takes you through an archway of roses . We just have grass that 's been walked on so much it 's dirt . But then you get to the front porch and that 's the part I like best . It makes a lot of noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look out over everything . <p> " What 're you doing ? " Emma asks . Where she came from I do n't know . I did n't even hear her . <p> I 'm standing here on the front porch , surveying our yard and all the things we 've got . Sometimes I pretend I 'm a princess and that instead of things they 're people , my subjects waving up to me on the balcony of my castle . <p> " What do you mean what am I doing ? " <p> " Who 're you waving at ? " <p> " I was n't waving . " <p> " Were , too . You 're pretending you 're a princess again , are n't you ? " Emma sits in Momma 's old rocker that 's missing most of the seat . She 's smiling ' cause she knows she nailed me . <p> " Was not . " <p> " Was to . What color dress you wearing ? " I can tell by the tone in her voice because she is n't making fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk my dream out loud so she can dream it , too . She 's all serious now . <p> " It 's pink , of course , " I say , " and it 's got sparkly beads sewn all over it so it looks like the dress is made of pink diamonds . And I have a big ole lace collar that 's made by hand . It 's not scratchy at all . In fact it 's so soft it tickles me sometimes . The sleeves are velvet , white velvet . They 're even softer than the lace . But the best part is my shoes . My shoes are made of glass , just like Cinderella 's , and they have diamonds on the tips so they can match my dress . " <p> Emma 's eyes are closed but she 's nodding . <p> " And here are my loyal subjects . " I sweep my arm across the railing toward the yard . " They all love me because I 'm a good princess , not a mean one like my stepsister . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them like they 're in my family . My loyal subjects " I say this last part to all the stuff in the yard . Oh , yeah , we also have an old iron bed out there . It 's rusted now but it used to be bright metal . It 's right up front so I pretend it 's the river of water that runs in a circle around my castle and that the front steps are a drawbridge . I wish the drawbridge could stay up and keep Richard from coming into the castle . <p> Uh-oh . Richard 's noisy truck is pulling into its parking space to the side of the house . I cai n't tell for sure but it looks like he might not be in too bad a mood right now . I 'm keeping my fingers crossed on that one . <p> " Whatchoo up to on this fine North Carolina day ? " He 's walking toward us , but I can tell by his speed that he is n't interested in our answer . <p> " Nothing , " Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us backing up to put more space between us and him . Just in case . <p> <br> Continues ...
