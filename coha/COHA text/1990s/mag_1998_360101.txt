Genre hopping is the favorite sport of today 's pop stars , and few performers play the game better than Beck . On his major-label debut , Mellow Gold ( 1994 ) , Beck helped re-energize folk motifs by combining them with hip-hop beats . On his new album , Mutations ( DGC ) , Beck has mostly abandoned hip-hop . His new sound draws largely from older , traditional styles : pure folk , blues and , on the spirited song Tropicalia , bossa nova . The energy of Beck 's hip-hop/folk experimentation is missed here ; this is a ruminative album that 's more about quiet revelation than sonic revolution . In fact , Beck delivers almost every song in a drained drone ; Mutations would have been better had it been a little livelier . <P> Still , there is something coolly mesmerizing and wonderfully disturbing about the CD . Beck 's lyrics , though elusive , are not nonsense . They obsess about issues of death and decay , and they strike at something deep , evoking feelings of sadness , melancholy and regret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulls me one way or the other , " he sings on Cold Brains . On another track he sings , " Treated you like a rusty blade/ A throwaway from an open grave . " <P> Beck 's voice on this album sounds worn and weary , as if he 's seen it all and seen enough . Everything seems disposed or disposable ; his song titles include Cancelled Check , Lazy Flies and Dead Melodies . Yet , calmed by his voice , we lean closer , listen closely . Beck 's music does not overwhelm his musings . <P>  --  By Christopher John Farley
