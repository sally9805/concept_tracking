Section : U.S. News The difficult search for racial peace in Brooklyn <p> Dateline : Crown Heights <p> In the Crown Heights section of Brooklyn , N.Y. , blacks and Jews have lived uneasily for more than two decades . But when a car driven by an aide to the leader of the Hasidic Lubavitcher sect , Rebbe Menachem Schneerson , jumped a curb on a hot August night , crushing to death a 7-year-old black boy named Gavin Cato , the gulf between them widened more than ever . <p> Almost immediately , the bonfire was lit . Angry gangs of blacks , many of them from outside the community , began rioting to avenge what they considered a murder , not an accident . Yankel Rosenbaum , a 29-year-old visiting Australian rabbinical student , was stabbed to death , and for the next four days , Crown Heights was a community under siege . Thousands of frightened Jews and many blacks hid in their homes , clutching their children , while outside a small army of cops and dozens of community leaders , black and white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer 's turmoil will not soon heal for the 30,000 Hasidim and 150,000 blacks who live in Crown Heights . Despite efforts by some to unite the communities , the main legacy of the rioting has been more mistrust and resentment between two groups that have long shared the pain of bigotry . Indeed , despite claims of inequality and government neglect from both sides , it is a conflict that has pitted people of similar family size and modest economic means against each other . It is , in the words of Nicolaus Mills , a professor at Sarah Lawrence College , a " victims ' competition , " which nobody wins and which is full of anguished voices . <p> HENRY RICE He joined in the violence at first but then drew back <p> On the night Crown Heights split in two , Henry Rice stepped over the edge of rage . In bitter revenge for Gavin Cato 's death , Rice hurled rocks and bottles at police and cursed at Jews . The boy 's death was n't an accident , he said . It was murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years unchecked , and now the police were protecting them . Rice saw it as a rough summary of the inequities ruling his own life . <p> On the second day of rioting , a local activist , Richard Green , heard Rice preaching revolt . Green told Rice the blood of black people hurt in police skirmishes would be on his hands . Rice called Green an Uncle Tom and threatened him with physical harm . But secretly , Rice says , " I knew he was right . " So he abruptly switched sides , grabbed a megaphone and proclaimed that no grievance was worth a black life , that Jews were only part of the problem : Poorly trained cops and neglect from city hall , he preached , also played a part . The crowd called him a " sellout . " " It got harder to tell enemies from friends , ' Rice says . <p> Rice , 22 , had been home less than a month after serving four years in the U.S. Coast Guard when the riots broke out . He had a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The neighborhood to which he returned seemed more desperate than when he left . He was haunted by childhood memories , of eviction slips tacked to his door , of the loss of close friends to crime or drugs , but mostly of his own wants that might never be fulfilled . <p> Before the riots , Rice says , he 'd never really known a Jew  --  and never saw the point of knowing one . They were the ones who walked down the streets of his neighborhood four abreast , pushing people off the sidewalks . " They seem to feel this is all theirs , ' he said with a wave of the hand on a recent drive past throngs of black-hatted Hasidim . When a group of Hasidim disregarded a DO N'T WALK sign , Rice said : " You see how they act ? " <p> Richard Green has helped Rice vent those feelings . He arranged a series of meetings with Hasidic young men , and Rice was the spokesman for a group of black youths . Wearing a tan camouflage bush hat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 , a cop stopped him onhis way to school and dumped out his book bag , looking for drugs he never had . The Hasidim argued that he must have been guilty of something . Later , Rice said , " You see ? They did n't seem to understand why that was important . ' <p> At another meeting , he told the group that he saw preferential treatment of Jews everywhere , from the failure of police to ticket a badly parked car with a sign written in Hebrew in the window to the failure to arrest the driver of the car that killed the Guyanese child . " Hasids have a rally and cops protect you , ' he said . " Blacks hold a demonstration and they saddle up for a riot . ' If a black man had run over a white child , Rice told the group , he would have been arrested . <p> Informed by the Hasidim that black men had run over Jewish kids in their neighborhood but had not been indicted , Rice said that Jews did n't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holocaust proof of freedom ? ' When a young Hasid said he always thought of black people as friends and was horrified at black antisemitism , Rice said he was n't an antisemite . He seemed startled at the descriptions of how black men had beaten Jews with bats and bricks and crosses . But he did n't express his shock and did n't apologize for his own anger . He would not back down . <p> At another meeting held at Green 's building , Rice acted as point man for blacks and Hasidim who wanted to play basketball together . When a Hasidic scholar said he could n't make it on Sundays because he had to study , Rice said , " You study on Sundays ? Get out of town ! ' As a man of action , Rice was genuinely shocked by someone spending all his time with a book . With his hoped-for boxing career fading and no luck finding work , Rice says he may re-enlist in the Coast Guard , leaving Crown Heights to find a more peaceful future on its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice  --  to make peace or give way to violence . <p> RIVKA M. The eldest of eight , she is undeterred by the turmoil in her neighborhood <p> For a young Hasidic girl , home is the focus of all aspirations : to keep a kosher table , raise abundant children wise in the ways of Judaism and support her husband in his scholarly duties . Home is the place to celebrate the sanctity of daily life , a shelter from the perils of the world . <p> Yet for 16-year-old Rivka M. , home last summer became a place for hiding in fear . It was just across the street from her apartment that Gavin Cato was killed . It was on her block that rocks flew and police cars burned . For three days , Rivka 's family , which includes seven younger siblings , hid in their cramped , two-bedroom apartment , wondering what they would eat when the cupboard was bare . " We felt helpless , " says Rivka 's mother , Penina . " Several times we called 911 , and they did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . ' <p> Rivka , like most of her friends , remains serene . She knows the hand of God is at work in every event . " Why did the car that hit Gavin Cato have to be one of the rebbe 's entourage ? ' she asks . " Why was there a Holocaust ? Why a revolution in Russia ? It 's all to teach us a lesson . The Messiah will come , but first there must be birth pangs . ' <p> Such faith gives form to every moment of Rivka 's day , which , in the aftermath of the turmoil , has quickly resumed its normal rhythms . She rises with a prayer thanking God for being able to see , hear and breathe . She eats no food without blessing it , crosses no threshold without touching the case containing the tiny sacred scroll on the doorframe and then putting her fingers to her lips . She is indifferent to pretty clothes or fancy things , most of the time wearing her school uniform of striped oxford shirt and long gray pleated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for eating and praying . Who cares how grand or beautiful it is ? The value of life is in learning and good deeds . ' She points with pride to the books that line her family 's dining room and , except for pictures of Rebbe Schneerson , are the sole adornment of the walls . " That 's what matters , " she says , " learning to be a Jew . " <p> In this life defined by communal ritual , children play a special role : It is in them that Judaism 's future is preserved . Cherished by their parents and well integrated into the grown-up world , these children show little of the alienation that frequently divides young from old . They are fearless , mischievous , outspoken and disturbed by what to them seems to be the failure of black parents to properly care for their children . <p> Rivka is impatient with Jews who fail to study their own history and religious law . " You are a Jew , " says her mother , " before you are a human being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she voices a complete lack of curiosity about anything outside Hasidic life . She knows all she needs to , she says , about her black neighbors . " We study their history in our secular classes , ' she says . " When do they ever study ours ? " <p> It 's not that Rivka feels rancor toward her neighbors . It was a black neighbor , she points out , who finally went to the kosher market on Kingston Avenue in those first days to buy food for her family . When his windows were smashed the next day , he put a sign up saying simply : " Blacks live here too . " A resident of her building , Isaac Bitton , was beaten on the street ; black neighbors hid him in their car and drove him to safety . " The kids with bottles and knives are outsiders , ' says Rivka . In fact , police statistics showed that fewer than half those arrested were from Crown Heights . " Most people here are decent and civilized , ' says Rivka . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black complaints that racism has robbed them of their future . " It 's sickening that these people who could be studying have to sit and take drugs . Let them go to a psychiatrist if they 're depressed . If they 're poor , is n't that what welfare is for ? They have exactly the same opportunities as we do . Their schools are even free . We pay for ours . ' <p> It is the most common Hasidic refrain : A history of slavery and racism is no excuse for failure . Jews were enslaved in Egypt , persecuted in the Inquisition , murdered in the Holocaust . Rather than use that to justify failure , they have drawn on it to fortify their will to survive . " If they are suffering , they have brought it upon themselves , ' she says . <p> Is there no obligation , then , to help those less fortunate ? " I think we should give to Jewish charities first , ' says Rivka . " We have trouble enough putting food on our own table . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to love all God 's creations . We 're not any more God 's creation than they are . It 's just that we realize it . ' <p> TRACEY BRIN She wants to be a ballet dancer , but her life is often a struggle <p> Ask Tracey Brin what she learned from the troubles in Crown Heights last summer , and she says she 's surprised the media made such a big thing of it . The black kids who threw things at Jews and at police could have brought out their 9-mm Glocks , their MAC 10s , their Uzis , their .45s or their .38s , she says  --  but they did n't . To her , that means it was much less serious than it could have been . Tell her that she is ignoring the importance of the violence done to Jews and of black antisemitism , and she gives the filigree of braids on her head a toss , puts her hand on her hip and shoots back : " Nobody Jewish died of a bullet to the head , but black people die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me about antisemitism . ' <p> Tracey turned 16 a week after the riots , but black-Jewish tensions were the furthest thing from her mind . At her birthday party , it was just the latest madness to pierce her life  --  a life as lacking in safety and certainty as Rivka 's is rich in it . A week later , she accompanied a group of black teenagers from the Brooklyn Children 's Museum to a Manhattan art museum to view a film about the Jewish painter Harry Liebermann , who painted scenes of the Holocaust . Tracey and her friends went to sleep during the showing . When her 10th-grade English teacher assigned Anne Frank 's " Diary of a Young Girl , " Tracey refused to read it . " I do n't like stories about sad people , ' she says . " Besides , why did n't the teacher assign a book about the slave trade ? ' <p> Despite her delicate frame , Tracey is a fighter , says her mother , Geraldine Brin . At her premature birth , she weighed less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mother calls Tracey " my miracle child , " and says she battled back with a will . <p> Tracey has dreamed of becoming a dancer ever since the day eight years ago when she saw a ballet on television . But keeping that dream alive has not been easy . Last summer , Tracey worked as a dance instructor at the children 's museum . She offered to use her first paycheck to pay her family 's overdue telephone bill . This summer she was thinking of abandoning her ballet training for an after-school job to help pay the bills . It was only when scholarship assistance came from the Dance Theatre of Harlem that Tracey decided to continue her quest . <p> Tracey lives in three worlds . First , there is Boys and Girls High School , where a girl can get beaten by boys for not saying hello . There , she is struggling to maintain a B average and is anxious about whether her dance routine will interfere with studying . Another world is the children 's museum , where she can let off steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her third world , at home , where her mother , who is disabled , is having a hard time controlling her 18-year-old brother , Anthony , a high-school dropout . <p> In such an environment , black-Jewish tensions are like distant thunder . Tracey 's contacts with Jewish people are rare . She believes the rumors common in her community : that Jews are trying to overrun the neighborhood , buying buildings and then failing to renovate them so they can sell them later at a profit , harassing blacks who wo n't sell . She says she went across Eastern Parkway once and was greeted by stares from Jews that " made me feel dirty . " <p> Still , Tracey says the talk from some black leaders that black people do n't have a chance is nonsense . " Some people need excuses , " she says . Black people may be downtrodden , but they can still achieve . She says Jews are a good example of a downtrodden people who refused to be kept down . Black people can do this too , if only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's the guns that interrupt her dreams of dancing the lead in " The Firebird . " <p> YITZCHOK GOLDBERG He spends much of his day in rigorous study to become a rabbi like his father <p> Rabbi Yaakov Goldberg was with his son at camp in Upstate New York when the phone call came . Mobs were in the streets , said his daughter , and a rock had just crashed through their window . For Goldberg , a fifth-generation rabbi who fled Russia during the Second World War , the memories set his stomach " turning with fear . " His grandparents had survived the Russian pogroms only to be executed as counterrevolutionaries for organizing Hasidic schools . His uncles died in German camps . His parents barely survived . <p> It is a story that could be told with slight variation by almost every Hasidic family in Crown Heights , by almost every Jew in the world . No matter where he lives , a Jew learns he must be forever vigilant so that such horrors happen " never again . " That is a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yitzchok . He must devote every second to nurturing his Jewish soul and spreading the ways of Yiddishkeit to less religious Jews . He must shun all compromise . <p> Six days a week at 7 a.m. , Yitzchok catches a bus to the yeshiva to spend 14 hours in study and prayer . He puts on tefillin  --  two long , thin leather straps with a box on each that contains biblical verses , which he ties onto his forehead and left arm  --  and prays for two hours . The rest of his day is devoted to Jewish philosophy and law , arguing intently with his study partner over Hebrew texts . At noon on Friday , Yitzchok and the others head off on a mitzvah ( good deed ) campaign , seeking out non-Hasidic Jews to help them don tefillin and pray . He spends the Sabbath with his family in rest and prayer . <p> Yitzchok will go to rabbinical college and then teach as the rebbe 's emissary in one of 1,000 Lubavitch yeshivas around the world . But for now , he says , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must withdraw from the world , including his black neighbors . " We can be friendly , but we should n't be friends , ' he says . " I do n't want to risk having my Judaism rubbed away . ' <p> Yitzchok 's isolation is encouraged by his parents , who forbid their children TV , movies or non-Jewish literature . What about Bach and Beethoven ? " There 's plenty of good Jewish music , ' says his mother . Shakespeare ? " An antisemite . " Yitzchok does n't protest . " I do n't see how these things could advance me in life . They might even degrade me . ' <p> The efforts to lead an uncompromised Jewish life can , however , disrupt the lives of Yitzchok 's black neighbors , especially when Hasidic rituals spill onto the shared thoroughfare of bustling Eastern Parkway . Each week , from sundown Friday to sundown Saturday , the section of the road leading past the synagogue is closed for the Sabbath . On the days before Yom Kippur , Hasidic women stand on a corner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking God to deflect onto the birds any ill fortune in the coming year . <p> During the eight days of the harvest festival of Sukkot , the Hasidim sing and dance all night in the streets . The singing is vital , says Rabbi Goldberg , bringing them closer to God . " Look at their parades , " he says . " They block our streets , make noise and dirt , but we understand . We make a small sacrifice for something of great value to them . Surely , they can do the same . ' When asked if it might promote peace to explain the rituals ' significance to their non-Hasidic neighbors , however , the rabbi bristles . " This is my religion . I do n't have to explain myself in the United States . It 's nobody 's business . ' <p> In the first days of trouble , chants of " JDL " could be heard in the streets . It is the rallying cry of the militant Jewish Defense League , active in " defense " of Crown Heights in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , guns and clubs . Yitzchok and the other children were quickly summoned by the rebbe . " The way of the Jew , " he told them , " is not war . " Yet even now , the militant voices are not silent . At Yitzchok 's school , a classmate hands out fliers offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to members of the Crown Heights " lynch mob " responsible for Yankel Rosenbaum 's death . <p> Violence between these neighbors is not new . In 1986 , three members of a Hasidic patrol were found guilty of beating a black teenager with a bat , hammer and hose . The next year , a Jewish man 's face was slashed by a black man with a razor and another was beaten unconscious by black teenagers and later died . In 1989 , a Hasidic child was killed by a black driver on the same corner where Gavin Cato was killed . There was no arrest ; nor was there a riot . <p> ' Violence is never justified , ' says Yitzchok . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't just stand there . And if a black is committing a crime , he should be stopped . But if Jews begin taking the law in their own hands , they should also be stopped . ' <p> RICHARD GREEN He is trying to help black and Jewish youths find common ground <p> Richard Green is used to living in a war zone . Two years ago , when someone fired shots from an Uzi submachine gun into his Crown Heights apartment at 2 a.m. , there was no time for him to comfort his toddler son . Green scooped up the trembling child , padded barefoot around shattered glass and put the child to bed in another room . He did n't call the police . He waited for morning . " I dug the slugs out of the ceiling , ' he says , " and then I went to work . " <p> It was Green , a tall , laconic community organizer and father of five , who helped prevent the Crown Heights riots from escalating into full-scale war . With an Egyptian ankh dangling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walked the troubled streets for hours , reasoning with the angriest young men that the real enemy was not Hasidic Jews but the chronic lack of services and programs that affected everyone . Dressed in a Nehru suit , dreadlocks tied in a ponytail , he told them their anger was being exploited by hatemongers like the Rev. Al Sharpton . Green helped arrange a peace council between Mayor David Dinkins and the most active black youngsters . It was the beginning , officials say , of healing long-exposed wounds in Crown Heights . <p> Green thinks part of the trouble is that there are fewer contacts between black kids and their Jewish neighbors than when he was growing up . " I worked in Jewish stores and earned pocket money lighting Sabbath candles for a Jewish family , ' he says . " They knew me and I knew them . Now , blacks and Jews celebrate their separateness . ' <p> Hatred has flourished in that isolation , Green says . Recently , a poster circulated urging blacks to " unite against your Jewish bosses . ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Leave no marks on the kid . ' It urged people to " do what Jesse did : Spit in their kosher food ' and to " damage Jewish goods . " <p> Green tries to blunt such messages by offering children a safe environment where they can learn about themselves and others . His city-funded Crown Heights Youth Collective provides counseling , tutoring and job training to 6,000 teenagers . He roams the community in a large van , imploring high-school students hanging out on street corners to return to class . In his renovated headquarters , he teaches history , geography and science without benefit of a blackboard , dictionaries or adequate maps . He notes the irony that New York City spent twice as much for police overtime during the four nights of violence as local , state and federal governments have spent in the past decade on programs for youth in Crown Heights . <p> In the evenings , Green organizes meetings between black and Hasidic young men . But finding common cause is difficult . To the blacks , Jews are oppressors . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of scholarly Hasidic boys was eager to play basketball in the black community but appeared to believe that athletic skill was all that blacks could offer . The idea that the Jewish kids might introduce blacks to Jewish culture did n't even come up . At another meeting , one of the Hasidic boys , Zalman Lezell , 16 , said he was " amused by the blacks .... I admire them because even when they lose at a game , they still say , ' Good game , man . ' If I lose I want to argue . ' <p> Both groups spend much time arguing over past hurts . At one meeting , a young black named Mike Reece blamed Jews for their part in the slave trade . The Hasidic kids knew nothing of this and could not respond . They spoke out against the riots , calling them pogroms . In private , they expressed a fierce resentment that no black leaders had stepped forward to condemn the rioting . Green fretted that the chasm between them is unbridgeable . " As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get bogged down , ' he said . Afterward , one of the yeshiva boys told his friends : " I think we already are . " <p> RABBI SHEA HECHT He is a savvy political emissary revered by the Hasidic children <p> While Rivka and Yitzchok live in a universe of certainties , Rabbi Shea Hecht grapples with the world 's more ambiguous realities . He oversees the only program in Crown Heights for drug addicted Hasidim , of which he estimates there are several hundred . He spent years as a " cultbuster , " springing kids from the Rev. Sun Myung Moon 's church and Hare Krishna . He speaks sadly of Jews who are externally religious but not at all spiritual . And the recent turmoil has taught him that the Hasidic children of Crown Heights , so well armed with strong families and the conviction that they are God 's chosen , must be taught humility and sensitivity as well . <p> Shea is the ideal teacher for the task . Blunt , funny and openly emotional , he is adored by the Lubavitch children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's easy to spot in his bright red yarmulke and unknotted necktie : He was a rebel in his youth , he explains , kicked out of the yeshivas many times , and in these small ways remains a rebel still , even as he takes on his late father 's immense responsibilities as the rebbe 's emissary to the secular world . <p> Shea 's drug program serves blacks as well as Jews . While training as a counselor , he spent a year going each week to the mean streets of the nearby Brownsville section of Brooklyn to sit in on Narcotics Anonymous meetings . A few weeks ago , he stopped at a pay phone in Bedford-Stuyvesant to call in to a radio talk show and was mugged while New York listened . Like Richard Green , he has been one of the principal restraining hands on the " hotheads " in his community , though he admits " it was n't too many years ago I would have been one of the stone throwers myself . It 's the same Bible , after all : an eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital punishment and lawlessness . ' <p> When the Jewish Defense League showed up shortly after Yankel Rosenbaum was killed , Shea made it clear " we do n't want them agitating here anymore than we want Sharpton . ' And at the first press conference after the accident , Shea lit a yahrzeit candle for Gavin Cato and offered his condolences . It was one of the few expressions of regret by the Hasidim . <p> Yet Shea has no patience for those who justify black violence as a legitimate response to social wrongs . He dismisses as " pure crap " the oft heard charge by blacks that the city gives preferential treatment to Jews . " If the problem is that we 're more successful at getting assistance from the city , why , instead of fighting us , do n't they call me and ask how we did it ? ' he asks . " I 'd be happy to help . " The problem , he argues , is a lack of black leadership . <p> Shea is equally unsympathetic to complaints of police favoritism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of blacks and no Jews . " Is that because the cops are prejudiced ? Or is it because we were n't the ones throwing bottles and burning their cars ? ' Shea 's own house has been burglarized 11 times . If anything , he argues , the Hasidim deserve to be commended for choosing to stay in a neighborhood with one of New York 's highest crime rates rather than fleeing with other whites in the ' 70s . Shea will concede that some Hasidim might not rent an apartment in their home to blacks . It is not racism , he insists , but simply a " preference to be with your own . ' <p> Still , Shea admits he was shocked at a televised report on ABC 's " Primetime Live " that showed blatant racism  --  a black man charged higher prices , denied credit , an apartment , a job . " I never dreamed it was so bad . That our children need to see . ' <p> He also hopes that the children will realize that their enthusiasm to spread the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be positive , but we need to recognize it 's being dispersed in a negative way . Jews are arrogant people . God 's at fault . He 's a racist and sexist . He said we were the chosen people . ' He adds : " But that does n't mean you treat other people like they 're worse . It means more is expected of you , more kindness , more patience , more love . ' <p> How then to heal black resentment at being told , effectively , you have nothing to teach me and everything to learn ? Shea answers sadly : " I do n't think we ever will . " After a moment 's thought , he softens . " We try to be respectful of everything , ' he says . " On Friday night , when we make the prayer over the wine , we cover the bread so as not to insult it . If that 's the essence of our teaching , how should our attitude be toward blacks ? I say should . It takes a lifetime and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Picture : No caption ( New York Daily News ) <p> Pictures : The reluctant point man ; The serene believer ; The dreaming dancer ; The devoted student ; The beleaguered statesman ; The activist teacher ( Stephen Shames-Matrix for USN &WR); <p> By Scott Minerbrook and Miriam Horn <p>
