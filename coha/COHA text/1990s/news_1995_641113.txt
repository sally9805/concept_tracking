<p> Neighbor praises Kaiser expansion , Lafayette St. closing <p> I am disappointed in your coverage of the Denver City Council meeting on Aug. 28 concerning the proposed Kaiser Permanente expansion project and the vacation of Lafayette Street . <p> Your reporter managed to sit through that almost interminable meeting and still miss the salient features of the discussion . Your writer chose to focus on the downtrodden opponents - people well-experienced in the political arena who have used a campaign of innuendo and untruth to inflame the largely uncritical group of people who supported them . <p> Your reporter did not comment on the extent of support for the project . The gallery was packed to overflowing , and the vast majority of the people there supported the project . The Uptown Urban Design Forum , a group commissioned by the Denver City Council to oversee land-use planning in the Hospital District and the group which has studied the project most extensively , supported the project . <p> The neighborhoods have a majority of votes on the Forum and even if only the neighborhood votes were counted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project . <p> Your reporter 's conclusion that a " difficult loop of streets to navigate just got harder " came from the opposition and is in conflict with the facts . Traffic use on Lafayette Street has been well-studied . This route is used by less than 4 percent of traffic from the neighborhood . <p> Traffic is the big issue , however . With Kaiser expanding and making its front door on Lafayette Street and St. Joseph 's Hospital expanding and making its outpatient front door on Lafayette Street , there will be more than 15,000 vehicle trips per day beginning or ending on Lafayette Street . It does not require genius to figure out that many thousands of these cars will make their way through the residential neighborhood to the north if Lafayette Street is not closed . By closing Lafayette Street , hospital traffic is directed onto 20th Avenue and Downing Street , designated for hospital traffic in the Urban Design Plan and recently redesigned to carry the load . <p> Studies show that the number of vehicles at the 21st Avenue and Franklin Street intersection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making Franklin more user-friendly . Other advantages to the neighborhood include a plan to bury all parking and create pedestrian-friendly green space covering more than 30 percent of the area . <p> Your writer expresses concern about forming a " superblock , " a term that has a specific meaning in land-use planning . The University Health Sciences Center or Presbyterian/St Luke 's Medical Center are superblocks - long expanses of walls facing pedestrian walkways . The proposed Kaiser expansion with its pedestrian permeability , trees , lawns and green space is not . <p> To my view as the nearest-living neighbor to the project , this is a win-win-win situation . Kaiser builds the project it needs , the neighborhood no longer needs to deal with new or existing hospital traffic , and the city gets a major center for primary health care in the inner city . For my part , I deeply appreciate the city council women who stood up for these principles and voted for this project over the objection of our local councilman . <p> CHARLES O. BRANTIGAN , M.D. <p> Facilitator , Uptown Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to work in private <p> Your editorial of Tuesday , Aug. 29 , headlined " What 's so ' private ' about jet noise ? " was wrong on the facts , wrong on the law and wrong on public policy . The editorial accuses me of ordering an airport aircraft noise meeting that was closed to the media . Furthermore , the editorial condemns the closure of the meeting as being a violation of the Colorado open-meetings statute and contrary to good public policy . <p> Your " facts " are wrong . I did not order that meeting on airport noise closed . I did not even know it was being held . The meeting was held by the airport 's technical group concerning aircraft noise . While one of its members did request an opinion as to the legality of securing the meeting from one of my assistant city attorneys , the decision to close the meeting was made by consensus of all of the members of that committee who felt that their work would be better carried out without the media and the presence of cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Administration , United Airlines , the Pilots Association , city staff members , city consultants and representatives of six counties . As the city attorney , I did not order that meeting closed . <p> Your statement of the law is wrong . Neither the city open meetings law nor the state open meetings law applicable to counties requires such a meeting to be open . The city " open meetings law " enumerates bodies that are subject to its provisions . A technical working group such as was involved here is not specified as covered by the ordinance . The state " open meetings statute " which might have been applicable to county personnel involved in the work session applies only to a " board , commission , committee , authority or other advisory , policy-making , rule-making , or formally constituted body of a political subdivision ( which ) has delegated a governmental decision-making function but does not include persons on the administrative staff of the local public body . " <p> No fair reading of the ordinance or of the statute would lead one to believe that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are studying and preparing alternatives for presentation to policy- makers is even covered by those laws , let alone that those laws mandate that such a meeting be open . In fact , the law was amended in 1994 to make it clear that administrative or technical staff were not intended to be covered by the open meetings statute . <p> The editorial is wrong on public policy . As expressed in the ordinance and in the statutes , such meetings are not covered and may , in fact , be closed to the press and to others who may not contribute to the purpose of the proceedings . These problem-solving participants must be free to express all of their ideas and opinions and to examine all alternatives ; unfettered by the pressuring glare of publicity and the fear of considering recommendations or courses of action which may be unpopular or ultimately rejected . <p> The sweep of the media 's curiosity is not all-inclusive . Even the public sector has the right to do some of its work without the intrusion of noncontributing onlookers . <p> DANIEL E. MUSE , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Citadel is not a liberal arts college replete with support groups and seminars . It 's a military establishment . And , like boot camp at any other military establishment ( including the Service Academies ) , its Hell Week accomplishes the same two necessary goals : it brutally winnows out the weak and unqualified , regardless of gender , and it fosters an " esprit de corps " among those who survive it . <p> Apparently , after she won admission to The Citadel , Shannon Faulkner and her supporters expected that she would be welcomed with open arms and have an easier time of it because she was a woman . Instead , it became readily obvious that Faulkner was neither physically nor mentally prepared to become a cadet at that institution . <p> Faulkner was not a victim singled out for humiliation and harassment by cadets of The Citadel during Hell Week because she was a woman . She was , quite simply , a quitter . I am saving my support and admiration for the future women ( if there are any ) who enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduates . <p> MARK PROPER <p> Arvada <p> More no votes planned <p> on funding of schools <p> We 're all for paying teachers a decent salary ; we 're probably even for hiring more teachers and having smaller classes . No one really wants to cut the arts or special-education programs . Everyone is eager to see " Johnny " learn to read - not to mention write , excel in math and learn science , history and computers . But a year ago we witnessed extensive breast-beating about the " shortfall " in the Denver Public Schools budget and heard incessant wailing about cutting valuable educational programs . So programs got cut , teachers were laid off and those who stayed were denied their raises - the " shortfall , " you know . Meanwhile , the Board of Education made sure the school administration was alive and thriving . <p> School is about teaching , not about administration . Personally , I will continue to vote down school-funding measures until the administration either takes a substantial pay cut or finds the courage to reduce its bloated ranks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational programs , eliminate the " shortfall " and pay teachers properly would be a good start . <p> GIOIA CARDELLI <p> Denver <p> Irony at China conference <p> Hillary Rodham Clinton , honorary chairman of the U.S. delegation to the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing , will no doubt continue the push for worldwide acceptance of abortion that Vice President Al Gore pushed at the same conference last year in Cairo . The conference in China is supposedly about women 's rights . Ironically , the one right women of China have been desperately crying for is the right to choose to not abort their children . <p> Who will speak for the rights of Chinese women ? It wo n't be Hillary Clinton . Nor will she be speaking for me . <p> DIANNE E. BUTTS <p> Denver
