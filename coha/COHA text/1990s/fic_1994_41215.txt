BED WAYS <p> On the Flathead Reservation you can come to a spot in the lad where the wind smells like sulfur , a dark smell , something you think you should be able to leave behind you , but it will be in your clothing and in your shoes . And there will be a darkness in the way you see things , a darkness you wish you could leave . The Indians say it is because of the old white-man ghost that haunts the Dixon side of the river , the old white-man ghost that rode through the land before Dixon was a town , because there were some Indians a long time ago and these Indians had listened to too many white men and they had found themselves hungry with only empty pockets of land , land that had a stinging edge , a bitter taste like the silt dark water on a beaver pond , a land they could n't leave , or see beyond , or even move for a short time , a land where the dark fish began leaving the rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulling current . <p> This was an end to the land , they told themselves , and not because their enemy the Blackfeet pressed in on them but because the land itself was being corralled . They had seen more than deer caught on the miles of thorn wire . They had seen small bundles tied tight with strands of horse hair and for the first time they did n't know who had placed the small bundles around them . It was a medicine that called them to bad dreams and woke them dry-mouthed and praying . And they knew that whoever had put the small bundles on the ripping wire was afraid of more than small hunger , whoever had left the bundles was afraid of a withering heat that could speak to them at night like a bad animal caught in their throats , afraid of old power dying on their tongues so that day by day their people would begin to stink with loss . And the power did leave . And these Indians so long ago had to bury their shit because they were locked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itch and the soles of their feet burned , because the strands of their hair lined with small white eggs . And a deep hunger made them small and so hungry , at night they dreamed of small bits of food in the mouths of birds , so hungry the sides of their bellies bloated like deer and their ribs became hard . And when they slept , they slept on soil or cattails ground to pitiful dust by the stiff bones of their asses because in their hunger they tried eating their elk blanket robes by boiling them clean in water . But the elk hide was thick and the water in which they boiled the hides stayed flat and bitter . The water did not foam up with the sweet smell of bone marrow . Then the hides turned green and the elk died twice . <p> When the white man came , he came with a shining watch , gold lined the back of his teeth , and he liked to smile because of it . He told these hungry Indians , the whole time playing with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gambling game with them , an Indian gambling game , and in exchange he 'd like to get himself an Indian woman . And the Indian men laughed because all of their women were so hard you could count their bones . They had lost their breasts , and their hair was coarse from lack of any oil . <p> " Just the same , " the white man had told them , " I want one of your women . " <p> And the Indian men , the few that would talk to him , were curious about this . They wanted to know what he wanted with their women . The white man looked them straight on . <p> " I do n't care who she is , " he said . " She can be ugly or beautiful . I want her to dance for me . I want her to dance like a small deer for me alone . " <p> Then the white man winked at the Indian men and they were not sure what he meant by this gesture though they knew it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to ask what it was exactly that the white man wanted . He wanted it all , they believed , to lie with an Indian woman in tall grass , to press into her , to sleep . They were only thinking of the bright gold at the cuff of his sleeve , the blinding white stones in his rings , his pockets deep with coins . <p> Some of these Indian men began to think about this . <p> " What game could we play with you ? " they asked him . The white man was quiet . He shrugged his shoulders as if he did n't have a game in mind , as if he did n't know how to win . The Indians named off stick games and foot races , story games and mazes . The white man put his hands on his hips and looked at the ground . And these Indians began to feel bad , thinking maybe this white man could n't gamble with them . Then they mentioned hunting games and fishing . <p> " I will fish , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will fish by myself and I will bring in more fish than all five of you . And if we fish a draw , " he said , " you will have my money . All my money . " <p> And these few Indian men looked at each other not wanting to smile and show the white man they had already won this game . <p> " Okay , " they said , " you go on and fish , but fish by yourself , " they said , feeling their winnings . " And if you only catch one fish , one big fish , you win . " <p> " Well , " said the white man , " you are being more than fair , but <p> must ask for the company of an Indian woman while I sit by the riverbank fishing . " <p> The Indian men looked at one another . This request did not seem so unreasonable . Their hesitation must have seemed like reluctance to the white man . <p> " Here , " he said to them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " We do n't need your horse , " they said , because they believed that they were winning . <p> So these Indian men , the ones that were talking to the white man , began listing all the women in the camp . They thought of Broken Feet and Long Man 's daughter . They thought of Small Salmon , how she was graceful and quick and pregnant . They thought of a woman who liked to sleep with all the men in camp , and laughed to recall she smelled like river mud and onions . They thought of Humming Blood but knew she was n't right in the head . Then they thought of White Crow . She was n't pretty and no man had spoken for her . She was quiet and never talked . She would n't complain if they forced her favor . They began wondering why she had been overlooked for so long , why Long Man had not made her more available . The Indian men snuck up close to White Crow and were surprised when she smiled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She stood up proudly and walked down the river to meet the white man . The Indian men waved White Crow on and sat down to wait for their treasures . <p> They sat a long time . They looked towards the river and talked among themselves . They wanted to feel the heavy coins in their hands . One talked about the gold watch and how he would smash the face to stop the white man 's time They laughed at this , stopping time . They looked at the sun . Much time had passed . They did not tell this white man he had to be back by a certain time . They worried a little . Maybe they should try to catch a few fish . Maybe he was already having such a good time with White Crow he was n't going to come back and settle his bet . Maybe he had already gotten what he wanted while they sat in camp waiting like fools . They remembered White Crow waving to them , White Crow walking to the river . They began talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for too long . They got it in their minds that they should go see what was going on with the white man and White Crow . <p> When they saw the river and the white man 's horse , they hunkered down behind the river brush , watching for the two of them , White Crow and the white man . But they only saw the white man sitting dose to the water , and beside him were larger fish than they had seen in a long time . They went down to the white man , admiring his fish . And he tossed the fish over to them . Fish flapped on the dry rocks in front of the Indians . Fish , their puffing gills powdered in dust , their green tails sweet and slick . Fat fish the length of a short man 's legs . The white man smiled at these Indians . The Indians looked at each other and smiled at the fish . For so long the river had run dry of food . The Indians forgot all about White Crow , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All of them hungry with the hope of fish . <p> " What are you doing to get these big fish ? " they asked the white man . " We have tried everything but our peckers . " <p> They laughed and the white man laughed , too . And they laughed harder as he lifted his hand and pointed down past the big rock where his silver line bit the water . What are you using ? swam in their heads . What are you using . Using ? They leaned forward where the water sunk deep to shadows . They looked past the mirror of their faces , down past the first tips of weeds , down again to where the water swirled once beyond a red rock pocked by the turning current , down to where White Crow danced dead in the water . Her eyes were dark and open , looking up from green darkness , looking up to see them all looking down on her , lost to water , White Crow , her long hair a tangle of weeds . <p> The white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his deep pockets , and tossed them onto the hard ground . Gleaming . The Indian men could hear the high , tinny sounds of silver dollars bouncing off rocks , a hundred small lights they could see from the corners of their eyes falling to darkness . <p> And when the Indian men pulled White Crow up from water , their hearts split with tears to see the open wound of her , the openness of her flesh fluttering to the open mouths of fish . White Crow slit from her woman hole to the hollow of her throat , her lungs now ghostly fish , her warm heart nibbled and cold . <p> Then these men , these Indians , they did back to the white man what the white man had done , not thinking of what it might do to them , not thinking what more it would take . These Indians , they beat the white man hard with river rocks until his breath stopped . They took all the things he wore on his body . They took his shiny black boots , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They beat the teeth from his gums with a wedge rock and dropped his long-rooted teeth in their pockets . Then they did to the white man what he had done to White Crow . They put a knife up the hole of his ass . They slit him up between his balls . They held their breath while they slit the pocket of his stomach and broke the pee sack . The Indians took the white man 's white horse and painted it red with his blood . Then these Indians held the white man up above their heads and shoved the muzzle of the horse into the white man 's hollow torso like a death mask , bound his body round the horse 's head and neck with tight thongs . The blind animal 's nostrils quivered with the scent of its owner 's blood . <p> Then these Indians sent the horse back as far as he could make it to the white man 's camp . But the horse stood still and when they slapped its haunches , the shied horse bolted , caught up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man splayed over the horse 's neck , the white man 's arms and legs beating the sides of the struggling horse . And when the horse fell , it could n't toss its head to get back up for the weight of the white man . And when the horse died and the white man and the horse began to bloat and stink by the river , the other Indians broke camp and tried to leave the smell and the bad feeling . But they could n't get far enough away from the stink so locked on the land they were . Even though they wept for White Crow , the white man , and the pitiful horse , they could n't escape what these Indian men had done nor what the white man had started . Not even after these Indian men had buried the white man and his horse , not even after the other white men came looking and could not find the white man or his horse or even catch the dry whiff of his white bones , the stench of the horse 's blue gases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These Indians , they brought some bad things here a long time ago . They brought the ghost of a white man to us because they gave him a place to shit his bad desires . And we must remember that something has gone wrong with us , something has made us scared of ourselves and what we know . Something has made us step back from the water and hold our shaking sides . We have lost ourselves when we let the white man come too dose , when we give ourselves away . And we need to go back to the water first , to listen , to embrace the ghosts that shiver our bellies . And sometimes when we are fishing in the smooth lakes in slow circles , when in the greenest currents the fat pike leap from the water with snapping teeth at dusk and the sky overhead is still and clear and the fish are blind , we are close to White Crow , her blood puffing clouds in the deep water , calling us . And there is a bad smell here sometimes coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our dreams of big fish beneath our boats opening their mouths to our hooks . A bad smell we should not ignore , like the musk smell of a deer that has died without prayer . Because little by little , over all these many years , the power is still leaving us , and we have to hook it , snag it like a great struggling fish and pull it back . <p> WINTER DEEDS <p> Do n't ask me why I agreed to do it or why I did it . I 've been asking myself the same damn question now for at least three days . It was money . I was drunk . The way I see it , I did both of them <p> favor . Stoner and the man near Charlo . But it scared me . I got spooked again , real good this time . I felt something : strange standing out there in that man 's field . I kept touching the crotch of my pants like I 'd pissed myself when I had n't . At one point <p> remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only on me , as if anyone looking out in the black fields could see me like one big asshole standing in a hard light . In the moonlight <p> could count the buttons on my coat . I could see the wart on my left hand and the twist-skin where the rope had almost burned my thumb off when I was fifteen . The halter buckle was shining silver , so bright I had to squint my eyes . I was drunk enough to say hell with it , to get back in my truck and drive the hell away from there , to drive past Pretty Chief 's house and yell for him to come out . <p> I went there to this stranger 's house like Stoner had asked me to with every intention of killing that quarter horse , of stringing it up on the man 's porch like a used gunnysack . Chop a hindquarter for chops for the dog . I do n't know what I had to be afraid of . I 'd seen a hundred horses killed , maybe more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken-down nags . And hell , here I spent an hour getting ready like I was stalking , like I did n't know the horse was kept in a steal-easy corral close to the house on good nights and in the third stall over from the Dutch barn doors on winter nights like we been having . You tell yourself things , things you do n't want to hear when your heart goes sour and you 're walking too fast toward trouble . But I was bad that night , standing at the corner of this stranger 's house , smoking . He had a few horses , not much , but I knew I was hearing the horse I was going to be killing . Those horses know . I heard his box kick in the stall , straight out , not hard but nervous , testing , ready to run . He could smell my blood , the noose in my hand , the blade of my iron knife . I was getting a little cold waiting but I thought I should wait even though there was nothing going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else he could be waiting at a black window with a power scope , an elk rifle that could split a man . I took my chances like a cowboy . I stepped out from the house . I listened to my footprints , the puff of my breath . I looked behind me but the house was still . The son of a bitch did n't sleep like any rancher I knew . I smiled to myself . Hell , once this was over I could kick back for a whole hard season . I could hire me a ranch hand to boss around . I could screw Louise maybe in a fine hotel in Missoula . I 'd smoke a good cigar while warming my ass in a tub full of hot soapy water . I 'd squeeze me some big tits , have a real good time . With money like this I would hammer the thick heads of a hundred head of cattle . <p> The barn door was open a ways . I walked in like I owned the place . I made small noises deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaves , trying to give this horse my scent . I pulled out my lighter and lit the darkness for a short while . I could see the nostrils of the other horses first , then their huge , quiet eyes , open wide to me , their ears starched . I walked carefully past them . I reached in my pocket for small bits of sweet apple . They sniffed but would not taste . I saw the quarter horse , not in the third stall but in the very last stall over . He stood calm-eyed and quiet in his stall , alert and powerful . I lifted up my lighter and he backed off . I could see the deep muscles in the horse 's shoulders , the withers defined by light , the rump was like a driving force , a mass of engine in horse flesh . I grabbed the jaw , a cutting horse , a good one . I was glad I did n't bring my special choke bit . The horse was trusting . I slipped the halter over its Roman head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had wanted a horse like this since my father first made me ride his hell mare . A mare , not a stallion , that threw me from her back three times and knocked me off against the corner of the corral , running a dead heat so hard that she spun off my kneecap . <p> This horse was obedient . Still , I was the son of a bitch that could kill him . I felt the edge of my knife through its leather holster . I walked him on out past the barn , out back to the fields . I could see him . I did n't talk to the horse like I do . I reached under its barreled throat and felt for a strong pulse of blood . The blood surged through the horse , a heat I could feel like power near the base . Some asshole told me once to slit the tongue of a big animal like a snake 's tongue so the blood will choke the sound of killing , or just slit the tongue and rope the mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour . Done . I thought . I looked down the horse 's mouth . A stupid idea from too many bar belts . I put my hand down on the great chest of the horse and decided to stab him hard , three times . Slug him . The blade deep . Drop him . I stepped back to take off my coat , and the back of the horse quivered . " Just do it , " I said to myself . I reached into my pocket and took out the leather sheath . I put it between my legs to hold on to it and took off my coat . " Just do it , you son of a bitch . " I could hear the pull of the knife through leather . I was ready . I gritted my teeth . I grabbed the halter and pulled the horse close to me . I could smell the sweet sweat of its mane . I had the reins in my fist and the horse 's head up when I felt a breath on my back so hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to look behind me and I saw nothing . Nothing at all . <p> I positioned the point of my blade to the horse 's big chest . I pumped my arm and lifted it far back , behind me . I thrust down with all the power in the sleeve of my arm , with all the muscles in my back . I wheezed in the struggle of my own strength but something happened . My arm did n't move . My arm did n't move one inch and I looked behind me and there it was , still suspended in air , ready to go . " You are a drunk son of a bitch , " I said to myself . But my arm would n't move . It hung there almost for the longest time . And I turned and had me a real good look in the dark . And for one crazy moment I could 've sworn I saw something , something like a ghost , standing just beyond me , but I could n't see much . What I really saw was bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat coil that was busted down the center and had lifted up . I could see a man 's ribs . I could see the thighbones . And I was n't spooked just then . If anything , I was dry sober . I was standing cold in a dry wind in snow , dry sober , looking at a ghost that should have been a sight for drunkenness but I was sober . It was the ghost of a man . I knew that , the way you know for no reason at all , that someone is watching you from behind . I was n't afraid . I loaded that horse up in the back of my rig and drove on out to Whiskey Flats . I let that horse go on five thousand acres of raw land , not knowing why , just knowing that was the thing to do at the time . I saw the spray of its tail , lifted high , beautiful , as he headed out . I did n't worry about the winter . I did n't worry about the drop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bad drops . I let that horse go free . I turned it loose on a night so cold I saw the blue bones of a ghost . And I did n't care about Stoner just then . I could make up a story . I could just say the farmer came out when I was ready to drop his horse so I took the horse and ran . I could tell him I dropped the horse , one shot in the Whiskey Hills . But that son of a bitch , I know he 'll be thinking , just like I 'd think myself , that I took the horse for me but even if I did , he 'd owe me . He 'll owe me big for this one . <p> I got Roy Hearn to wake up in the middle of the night . I pounded at his window so the lazy son of a bitch would get up before daylight . He did n't even ask me what I was doing on his porch at two in the morning . He sold me one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I went out back and felt guilty as hell to look at all these broken-down horses , scarred , some limping , waiting for the truck to take them into Bozeman . No longer horses , no longer good rides or a cowboy 's freedom . Now they were meat . <p> I found one the same color as the farmer 's horse , the same color . I put that horse down right there . Roy yelled out his window once at me . " Trying to sleep , " he said . But the horse had already gone to rest . I skinned it right there with the other horses huddled against the farthest fence . Hell , they know what 's going on . I held my nose . The whiskey was still in me somewhere , threatening to come back up my throat at the smell , the deep gut smell , the bad smell of death that should have come years ago . Animal death ached in my nose . I popped the knife into hard bone . Stung my fingers like a son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water pouch I kept behind my seat . When I had gutted the horse , I pulled the hide away from the corral . I left the meat still steaming . I figured Roy would appreciate the extra meat for no money . I got in my truck and turned to look at the corral . Smoke rose up from the shivering horses ' backs and I thought to myself they 'd be steaming like the other horse , but only in a butcher 's concrete room in a few days and maybe I 'd done this one horse <p> favor . But I 'm a son of a bitch . I do n't need a dozen doe-eyed horses flinching back from me to tell me . I know I 'm a son of a bitch . <p> By the time I got to the first curve in the road to Charlo , I had to pull over my truck and lose the whiskey . I could feel the chafe of whiskers on my collar . I saw the farmer 's house again . I got out of the truck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse hide . I put my gloves on and opened the hide out flat and a heavy heat rose from it . A bitter smoke . There was a feeling of morning rising in the air . The colors were flat . The mountains were edged now . The stars were thinning . <p> I looked at the man 's house in the distance . He had slept through this long assault . He was still snoring . A sorry son of <p> bitch . I reached into the truck and picked up the water bag . I slung the horse hide on my back and my bad knee bowed . My boots crunched the field snow . I felt the cold in my battered ass , the click of my teeth . Everyone must be sleeping . <p> About halfway to the field , I realized what a sorry son of a bitch I really am . A crazy asshole that has chased a good man 's horse to hell , lost a good night 's sleep and at a minute to morning is still up , pranking like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart for the job . I decided to hell with Harvey Stoner . I 'm leaving the carcass on the corral . And I left . By the time I got back to my truck my knees were buckling with cold . The back of my head was tight and I looked up to see the farmer 's light glowing in the distance . I rolled down my window as I was driving away , still in semi-darkness . I left my headlamps o &; I stopped once , listening for an angry voice but I heard nothing but the popping of my tires over frozen road . And all the way home I could hear a crying so hard I would look into my rearview mirror to see if someone was in the truck bed behind me . But there was no one , not in the lonesome truck bed or the seat behind me . There was no one , only me . <p> OLD GHOSTS <p> A smiling woman picked her up about a half mile from the Vullets ' house and when Louise told her that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face was a shadow in the warm car . The woman steered her car onto the first wide spot in the road . She had reached across Louise 's lap and had tugged at the door handle while the car was still moving . The woman 's face was tight and for a moment Louise thought that she was smiling . The car pulled to a slow roll and stopped . The woman pushed the door out so hard the springed hinges creaked and the door came back fast at Louise . The woman drew her chin in tight to her chest and stared up at Louise . Louise got out of the car and before the woman had the door closed she was off again . <p> Louise watched the spin of the woman 's tires on the slick roadside . The woman rode the pedal . Louise heard the high whine of the wheels grinding . The wheels spun so hard they almost burned . When the tires finally took hold , the car whiplashed down the highway for such a long way that Louise began hoping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard over the hills , a charcoal face , Louise thought , the chest and front legs of a giant horse running , clouds turning . She stood at the road and looked over at the dull silver river . She could see the black water where the animals had chipped a hole in the ice . Day was sinking . Through the naked trees she heard the river 's voice . Louise told herself it was only the ice , the fingernail-thin ice pulling on the shore . Louise squinted at the water skin rattling on the river , the place where the current ran hard . The still-water place where her sister had died last summer . She stood for a long time watching the spot of her sister 's death hoping she could call her sister back . For a moment there was no sound . Snow snaked on the road . She watched with her eyes clear and seeing . She watched with a heart in her chest , her heart slowing . She could feel the day around her slipping . The closer you are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandmother had told her . She wondered if now was one of those times . When she heard the ice crack she felt the break along her spine , an opening . She listened to the shrill splitting river . A sound like a woman moaning crossed the water bank . <p> A mule deer leaped from the dense brush and dipped across the changing river . Louise heard its hollow clocking steps kicking ice and then its hooves broke to water . The ice creaked like an old door closing . She saw , not wanting to believe what it was she was seeing . <p> She saw the deer 's dark eyes roll up white , a dear splash of water gurgling . And then the river was silent . She stood for a moment looking toward the dense call of water . This was the place where her sister must have looked up once maybe or again and again without seeing or seeing only this panic of water rising up her neck . Louise 's hands trembled . She ran toward the river , not taking her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brambles scratched her face . She slipped and fell and saw the chuffing mouth of the hole , a small hiss of water smoking and the animal gone . She got back up , chased the river run from the bank , watching the still river place , her own heart strangled by the thought of water , trying to see beneath green swirls of ice , hoping she had n't seen the deer fall through , still hoping she could save it somehow . But she knew the water ran fast here and never froze . She had never known there to be a fishing hole here in winter . Water only glazed . <p> The deer was gone . <p> The wind chattered in the red bramble . <p> She stopped running and felt her breath tight in her chest . How many times that summer day , Louise wondered , had her sister lifted her face up from the water only to smell this place here , the burn of nettle , the smell of sky meeting water ? The last memory for Amelia must have been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn into the length of a long summer and become the only thing we remember . A blind and blinding memory . <p> She pointed her steps homeward and felt the wind gather speed . It pushed at her back . She felt her nerves stinging cold . The tips of her ears itched . She began to wonder if she had ever seen the deer . She watched her feet . The snow was so cold-dry she could hear the squeak of her footsteps and a sudden quiet . The quiet that meets the day at evening . Her breath steamed in front of her . She tried to think of home . She tried to think of a warm place . She saw only the big poster bed in Stoner 's house . The small pillows . The framed pictures on the walls . She could almost feel the heat rushing up the vents , heat rushing to the pulse in her throat , hot , the first glare of summer again and again , so hot she would drop her clothes and stand naked to open-mouthed Harvey Stoner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stand barefoot and naked on the hot brass plate , press her hand to the window , and melt ice in a winter that dipped to twenty below , and never feel the sting of cold . She would stand on the vent until the scorch of hot brass nipped the tough soles of her feet . <p> He would lie on the bed sometimes . He would lie on the bed and unzip his pants to touch himself , to watch her . She would hold her breasts for him . He would cry sometimes . She would drape herself in a white sheet and pretend to be his daughter . She would braid her hair . And Harvey Stoner would kiss her . She could smell cigarette smoke in the deep pores of his skin and she would pull back from him . He would kiss her hair until her hair would unwind from its braid . And he would smile and sleep . And she would sneak downstairs to visit his wife 's pantry . <p> In the dark , in a room bigger than her grandmother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would touch the store-bought cans of peaches , plums , pears , the shelves without beans or sacks of dry meat . She could feel no mouse turds or spider webs . The room smelled like boxes of apples , Macintosh or Transparent . And while Harvey Stoner slept she would drink the juice from a cool can of apricots . She would eat his sweet peaches in the good-smelling room . And then she would walk home , leaving Harvey to find a row of empty cans lining his wife 's clean kitchen counter . <p> Louise had never really seen Mrs. Stoner before today . In the distance she had always looked like a woman who had a lot of money . In her passing car she always looked satisfied and happy . She looked almost young . But today Louise had seen her face up close . She had seen the face of a woman who had slept with Harvey Stoner for fourteen years . Fourteen years of new cars and big rings . And she saw in the woman 's face a mean sadness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , really . And Louise hated Harvey Stoner . Once she had slept with another man just to get the scent of Harvey Stoner off her skin . The nights he pulled her into his car to suck her breasts were the nights she would n't go home . She would stay outside her grandmother 's house . Now Harvey Stoner could touch her and it did n't matter anymore . She felt only small tugs on her skin , a heat on her belly , and then he was gone . And the less it bothered her , the less it mattered to her , and the more he wanted her . And the more he wanted her , the less it mattered to her . Until he became small to her . She was n't sure what she wanted from him now . All Louise could feel was her hunger . A want that stayed with her like a small bird that chirped in her dreams , woke her hungry . <p> She was cold and tired . She would sit down by the roadside just for a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands beneath her arms . She blinked her eyes to the cold , to the dark coming . She sat still to the silver river and the silver-pink sky . She sat still . She sat as if her breathing had left her . The hills were turning dark against the pale sky . The flutter of birds had quieted to night . She could see the shadowy branches of the cottonwoods down by the river . She remembered the hushed noises of a hundred settled birds , then the rush of robin 's wings leaving . She thought of her sister Amelia . Her sad , sweet smile . All the sweet , wild roses were gone . The huckleberries , sarvis berries , Indian celery , were long sleeping beneath the knee-deep snow . The fat deer had chased the new growth far up the timberline . And the mule deer she had seen was now cradled in the swirling river far down the river , swallowed , rocking to dark silt . The land was deep in the crushing sleep of winter . Louise blew breath into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands back into her pockets and felt the tight curl of her fingers , the burn of blood . She would sit down on the roadside for just a moment , she told herself again . When she closed her eyes she could see the pale sun . <p> It was Jules . Jules in his blister-blue truck , his headlights smoking . He had lifted her from the roadside and carried her to his truck . He had made her mad . She had slapped him for waking her when the good dreams had just started to come . The windshield was frosted with his breath . The moonlight was white . She could smell the sweat of horses , the scratch of heavy wool at her face . Jules had thrown his horse blanket on her . She could n't open her eyes even when she knew Jules was pounding the dashboard to wake her . The heater hummed . And she turned toward sleep . He slapped at her face until the roots of her hair were fire . " Christ : ' he whispered . " Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing . The sleepy shift of the truck rounding curves . And Jules whispering . Whispering to the sound of the slick hum of wheels . " I 'm taking you to my home , Louise . You 'll be fine . I 'm taking care of you , " he said . " I need to go to Missoula tomorrow early . But I ' 11 be back . I ' 11 be back , " he said . She thought he had kissed her hair . And she remembered that he had carried her into a dark house that smelled like camphor and tobacco . He had taken off her clothes , jerked her arms out of her sleeves . She opened her eyes to see his sleek chest , to see him naked and pulling back the blankets on his bed . She remembered the heavy pull of sleep again , the blankets , the thick heat of Jules 's hands cupping her buttocks , the way her teeth chattered even in sleep . <p> " Jesus , " he said . " You could have died out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was leaving but he did not say goodbye . She lifted the curtain and saw the dark light of dawn . She pulled the covers back up and closed her eyes . She thought she was alone . <p> The woman was in the kitchen and Louise watched her lift her hand above her eyes as if she were squinting into the bright sunlight or as if she were waiting , watching for someone . Louise knew that she was in the house of Jules Bart . She remembered the rooms . She could see his work pants on the floor of the kitchen , a pair of long underwear over a chair . The woman walked carefully to the cookstove and opened the door without gloves . The fire was so hot , Louise could feel it from where she stood but when she walked closer the kitchen was cool . She could place her hand in the stove even though she could still hear the crack of the hot wood fire . The kettle hissed on the stove without steam . <p> The woman was dressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown , and over her ears was a fresh spray of bluest lupine . The woman looked out the window and wiped her hands on her apron . Someone was coming . Louise looked outside . The snow was falling and she wondered if she might be dreaming . <p> Louise walked barefoot into the living room . She could hear birds outside , hundreds of birds , and yet she knew it was winter . She listened closely . From the far field she could hear the mourning dove and meadowlark . She opened up the door to hear better . She opened up the door to see summer , and an ice-tingling wind shot through the house and slammed all the doors shut . Louise turned to the woman . " Hello , " Louise said to the strange woman , " hello . " The woman did not answer her . It was as if the woman did not see Louise at all and when Louise stepped into the kitchen she felt cold . Her teeth chattered and her shoulders ached from shaking . <p> Louise turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was dear as water now . The hair of a ghost , the pale eyes of a ghost turning to Louise . Louise could see death now turning to pass through the door of Jules Bart 's house . Louise could feel the cold lifting from the woman like heat lifts from the road in hottest summer . Nothing . And beyond her leaving , in the dream of the smallest second , the pale , green grass of a spring morning . Buttercups and buds . <p> Louise found her pants and her shirt in the bedroom . She found a pair of dirty socks that were n't hers and decided to put them on anyway . She grabbed her boots and dressed as she moved to the door . She knew she had to get home , that her grandmother would be worried about her . She slid her stocking feet on the floor of the dining room . She bent over to tie her boots and heard someone . She heard someone talking . It sounded like a young man with a cracking voice . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them but she sees them . She puts her chin to her chest and prays that she is dreaming . When Louise looks up she sees the woman again . This time the woman is unmoving . This time Louise knows the woman is dead . She is laid out on the dining room table . She is shoeless . Her toenails are long and yellow . Louise holds still . <p> A young man , a boy , really , enters the room with a steaming bowl of water . He looks like Jules but he is only fourteen years old at most . He sets the bowl down and Louise gets a sudden whiff of spearmint . He has scented the water . The smell makes Louise lonesome for summer and she remembers the warm smell of sweet grass above the river . <p> The woman is still on the table . Louise looks at the woman 's dress , the long folds that drape to the floor . It is a heavy dress . The woman 's hair is in a tight knot at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young man takes the pins from her hair one by one and her hair untwists from her head and touches the floor . Her hair is brown and silver and the boy brushes her hair carefully . She can hear the whistle of his breath through clenched teeth . He brushes her hair for a long time , smoothing each brush stroke with his hand . Louise feels a tightness in her chest . Even though it is winter she can hear the quaking aspens outside shivering silver . Louise hears the warm wind . She wonders if she steps outside if she can hold this time . <p> He washes his hands for a long time and then he carefully unbuttons the woman 's dress . There are many buttons but he takes his time . His hands shine at her throat . There is a quiet in the room made quieter by his breathing . He unbuttons every button , unsnaps every snap , and when he is finished he struggles to remove the dress from her . He props her left elbow , trying to yank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry now and he tears the dress up the left sleeve and bares her arm . He tears the dress again , exposing both of her thick arms . He dips a washcloth in the steaming water . He hisses . The water is hot . Louise can smell spearmint . He lifts the woman 's wrist and swipes her arm twice . The boy takes a long breath . The woman is heavy on the table in her long skirt and bodice . She has more clothes on than the living . Louise knows the boy will undress her . <p> He starts with the bodice . He unlaces it . Louise hears the slap of the laces unthreaded . Her body opens slowly as if she has been bound tight all of her life . The woman 's breasts blossom . They are large and white . The boy does n't look at them . His hands are long and slender . He tries to undo her slip . He walks to the end of the table and tugs at the hem of the slip , trying to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit . He jerks again and when he looks up to see her breasts jiggling he stops his effort . His neck is red and his face looks hot . He stands for a moment . He looks at the woman 's face and then he digs in his pocket . He pulls out a small closed knife . He opens the blade with his teeth and slits her skirt open . By the time he gets to her full hips he realizes she is naked . He realizes he has passed the cuff of his hand through the hair between her legs . Louise closes her eyes for a moment , knowing she is seeing something that she should not be seeing . He pulls a breath so tight into his chest and stumbles back so fast Louise knows he has touched the woman in a private way . He backs up for a moment . He looks at the floor . He looks at the door . <p> Louise thinks that he is finished . She feels that he will leave this task . But he goes back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fist without wincing . He washes her face . He places the cloth to her breast like he 's not touching her at first . And then he is washing her hard . He is washing her like a table . And he cries . He puts his head down on her chest and he cries hard . Louise realizes he is alone . There is no one for him . He cries so hard the table shakes . He sucks at the woman a little , then he sucks her breast hard . Louise bites her lip , surprised at how she feels , how his sadness grips her chest . He cries open-mouthed at the ceiling . He puts his head back down on the woman 's chest . His mother , Louise thinks , feeling stupid for not knowing that from the beginning . His dead mother . He stops crying for a while . He looks up straight at Louise and she sees the young face of Jules Bart . She wants to hide from him but she knows he can not see her . Jules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has been seen . <p> And then the man comes in . He has seen Jules . He has seen Jules at his mother 's breast crying . He is pulling the gloves from his hands . Jules Bart kneels down and covers his head and all Louise hears is the sound of the man 's dull fists on the backs of Jules 's hands , his arms , his hollow chest . <p>
