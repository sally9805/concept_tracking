<p> PAT BUCHANAN stands in the back of a pickup parked at the edge of a dormant cornfield . A small group of ardent supporters has gathered despite the winter chill . Behind Mr. Buchanan , campaign workers struggle to pull a blue tarpaulin off a roadside billboard , one of 24 he is unveiling around the state to proclaim his economic nationalism . <p> The billboard reads : " Buchanan : He 'll bring the jobs home . " <p> Buchanan did n't choose this town by accident . Across the street from the cornfield lies the sprawling Fisher Controls Inc. , a valve manufacturer . The company once had two plants here , but as soon as the North American Free Trade Agreement ( NAFTA ) was passed , Buchanan tells the crowd , Fisher closed one facility and moved the operation to Mexico , at a cost of about 300 jobs . <p> Fisher disputes Buchanan 's version . According to a company spokesman , the work performed by the plant was shifted to other Fisher plants both in and outside of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buchanan has never been one to deal in nuance . There 's right and there 's wrong , black and white , like the ink on the newsprint that got him started on a career as an editorialist , presidential speech-writer , television pundit , and now two-time presidential candidate . <p> When the issues are jobs and international trade , Buchanan is absolute : Participation in NAFTA and the new World Trade Organization is tantamount to " surrendering American sovereignty , " he says in a Monitor interview . <p> On abortion , there 's no middle ground . Human life must be constitutionally protected from the moment of conception . Aid to foreign countries ? End it completely . American troops in Bosnia ? Pull them out and send them to guard the Mexican border . <p> But of all issues , economic nationalism has become the theme of Buchanan 's second long-shot run for the Oval Office . Ironically , his populist mantra against free trade and big business has put the firebrand conservative - on this issue , at least - in league with the political left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GOP at a time when the party would rather be closing ranks to defeat President Clinton . <p> Buchanan is unapologetic . But for someone who is admired by his supporters for the rock-solid constancy of his views , he is in fact a johnny-come-lately protectionist . <p> " I concede the point , " says the pugnacious TV personality , " I used to be the most pro-wide-open free-trade man in the Reagan White House with the possible exception of the president ... <p> " But what I 've found in the last five years is a terrible phenomenon in this country . It is the steadily declining real wages of working men and women in this country . The ones who produce things and manufacture things and work on assembly lines and work in small plants ... <p> " And it seems to be that those of us who are conservatives ought to be tremendously upset about this because we 're concerned about community stability , we 're concerned about the family . " <p> Mr. Family Values <p> Indeed , family looms large in the life of Patrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls in a prosperous Roman Catholic family in suburban Chevy Chase , Md. , Pat Buchanan recounts an upbringing rich with experience - and scrapes with authority . <p> Most admired and feared was his father , Bill Buchanan , whom Pat calls affectionately in his memoir " the man with the strap . " The four oldest Buchanan boys , each born a year apart , learned to do battle while still in their cribs , with Dad 's encouragement . <p> " While other boys were being punished for getting into fights as toddlers , we were punished when we failed to hit a punching bag 400 times a day , " Buchanan recalls in his book " Right From the Beginning . " <p> Combat has been a leitmotif of Buchanan 's life . As a youth , it was mainly mischief - weekend brawling and arrests that he says were " simply no big deal " - though in his senior year at Georgetown University in Washington , he assaulted two policemen while they wrote him a ticket ; Georgetown suspended him for a year . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While a speechwriter in the Nixon White House , he was the resident conservative attack dog , reliably recommending a tough line . Nixon aide H.R. Haldeman 's diaries are sprinkled with references to Buchanan 's style : " President was delighted with Pat 's kickoff speech for VP , which really hits hard . " He also mentions , early in 1972 , the " Buchanan thesis , " that Nixon 's political posture should be as a " fighting president " rather than a " professional president . " <p> If Buchanan got his classical education from the Jesuits at Washington 's Gonzaga High School and later Georgetown , he got his conservatism from his father . At the head of the dining room table , Buchanan writes , " sat an authoritarian figure whose political heroes were Douglas MacArthur , Joe McCarthy , and General Franco . " <p> Angela " Bay " Buchanan , one of Pat 's younger sisters , apparently absorbed the family culture as well . As manager of both of his campaigns , she 's called Pat 's " field general . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , though usually delivered with a twinkle , is a turnoff to some conservative voters . Fellow conservative Republican candidate Alan Keyes , an African-American , finds some of Buchanan 's racially tinged comments offensive . Buchanan has also battled accusations of anti-Semitism , fueled by the Bitburg flap , when he defended President Reagan 's plan to visit a German military cemetery containing Nazi graves . Conservative William F. Buckley will not publish Buchanan anymore in the National Review , because of the anti-Semitism issue . <p> But Buchanan has his true believers , and a message that resonates . " Pat 's my man ... , " says Denise Jones , a former teacher attending a rally near Des Moines . " NAFTA and GATT the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade made up my mind . Pat was one of the few voices speaking against it at the time . " <p> Tom Williamson , a former Buchanan aide in Colorado Springs , has been a Buchanan fan since his college days , when he and his fraternity buddies watched Buchanan 's verbal sparring matches on CNN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ populist conservatism has gotten lost in the Republican Party , " he says . <p> Conservative activist Howard Phillips , an old ally from the Nixon days , argues that Buchanan would do better off running for president outside the party . The " establishment " Republican Party , he says , is too prone to compromise . <p> Indeed , many moderates in the party also wish Buchanan would take a hike , or at least tone down the rhetoric . Four years ago , at the GOP convention in Houston , he delivered a fire-breathing speech on America 's " culture wars " - during prime time . Some Republican moderates moan that Buchanan hurt the party 's image and helped hand the election to Bill Clinton . <p> Buchanan is unrepentant about ' 92 and promises more of same for ' 96 : " I believe we 're going to have a conservative convention , we 're going to have a conservative party , and we 're going to have a conservative platform . And I would offer as testimony to that the fact that Arlen Specter ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ votes . Arlen dropped out with 1 percent of the vote . " <p> Chances are dim that Buchanan could win the Republican nomination , though the latest poll out of New Hampshire shows him running a respectable third behind Bob Dole and Steve Forbes - which makes him first among the hard-line social conservative candidates . Since he has never been elected to office , some voters may shy away from his lack of experience . But it allows him to claim outsider status , even as he boasts of his years on the " inside " in three White Houses . <p> Asked how he differs from candidate Phil Gramm , Buchanan says : " Phil is a career politician , and I am not . I 've spent eight years in the White House , and he has not . I think I know the kind of leadership the White House requires . It 's a leadership of conviction , of consistency , and constancy . It 's a leadership of vision . " <p> But if Gramm or Dole gets the nomination , Buchanan says he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gramm and Dole are " career politicians , they 've had a long career of heroic conservative rhetoric and compromise and cave-in , " Buchanan says .
