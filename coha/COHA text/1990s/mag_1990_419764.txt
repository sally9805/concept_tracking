Section : HIGH NUTRITION NEW WEAPONS IN AN OLD FIGHT <p> What scientists know  --  and do n't know  --  about treating cancer with nutrients <p> HYDROXYUREA . MERCAP-topurine . Cyclophosphamide . One thing all cancer drugs seem to have in common is their hard-to-spell names . <p> Or do they ? How about A ? D ? E ? These are n't fancy new drugs  --  they 're plain old vitamins . Yet when administered by scientists in large doses , some vitamins may act like drugs , or work with standard cancer-fighting drugs . It is n't clear vet whether the research into this futuristic notion of vitamin chemo-therapy will ever pan out . But if the research is successful , chemotherapy could be much easier to take  --  and a lot easier to spell . <p> Here 's the latest on what scientists have learned so far : RETINOIDS AGAINST SKIN CANCER <p> Several synthetic forms of vitamin A , collectively called retinoids , have been tested as treatments for skin cancer . They 've mostly been pitted against the two skin cancers known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the experimental stage  --  oral doses of retinoids have been effective against these carcinomas because retinoids accumulate primarily in the skin . <p> Most of the studies performed so far have been small , but the results are encouraging . These skin cancers , like all the others that retinoids have been used against , are unlikely to regress on their own . So researchers think that even though their tests are preliminary and have no control groups , the retinoids are probably responsible for the positive effects . <p> The retinoids etretinate ( eh-TRET-tin-ate ) and isotretinoin ( EYE-so-tret-in-OH-in ) have been used to treat basal-cell carcinoma . In three separate studies on a total of 56 people , 23 showed a partial regression of cancer ( the tumors shrank ) , and five showed complete regression ( disappeared ) . This is an overall response rate of 50 percent , meaning rhat half the people experienced some decrease in the number or size of tumors . <p> Once treatment was completed , though , many of the cancers returned . This suggests that regular doses of retinoids may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , doctors are conducting studies to determine the best maintenance dose : one that minimizes skin and mucous-membrane drying , the main side effect . <p> Researchers are having better luck using oral retinoids against squamous-cell carcinoma . In four small studies , a total of 14 squamous-cell patients were treated with etretinate ( 4 patients ) , isotretinoin ( 9 ) , or arotinoid ( 1 ) . Six of the 14 had partial remission ( tumors reduced in size ) or temporary remission ( tumors shrank or stopped growing for a short time ) ; another 4 had complete , sustained remissions of the squamous-cell tumors . That adds up to a 71 percent response from an admittedly small sample . <p> Both basal-cell and squamous-cell carcinomas are relatively easy to cure with surgical removal ( used in 90 percent of cases ) , radiation therapy or tissue destruction with extreme heat or cold . So why all this fuss about retinoids ? <p> Surgery and other tissue-destroying therapies leave scars . That 's not a big problem for a person with one tumor on the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have several tumors on areas of the body that are regularly exposed to the tumor-inducing ultraviolet rays of the sun : not only the hands , but the head and neck as well . <p> Retinoids do n't leave scars : Tumors shrink away and normal tissue fills in . That 's especially valuable in advanced disease . " One patient had severe , disfiguring tumors on his neck and nose . After six months on isotretinoin , the neck tumor had shrunk to a small , flat lesion . And the nose tumor had shrunk by 70 percent , with preliminary rebuilding of his all-but-eroded nose , " explained Scott M. Lippman , M.D. , of the hematology/oncology department of M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas , in Houston . <p> Retinoids have also been tested against malignant melanoma , a more serious form of skin cancer . Preliminary results from a small study of 20 people with advanced melanoma showed some shrinkage of tumors in three people . It 's far from a cure , but it 's a glimmer of hope against a type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare skin cancer called mycosis fungoides ( my-KOH-sis fung-GOY-dees ) has shown good response to retinoid therapy . In five preliminary studies , a total of 78 people with the disease were put on oral isotretinoin . More than half showed at least a partial response . The National Cancer Institute is currently sponsoring a clinical study of isotretinoin in combination with other substances against this cancer . BATTLING IN THE BLOODSTREAM <p> Synthetic versions of vitamins A and D seem to hold promise in the treatment of myeloid leukemia , a cancer of the white blood cells . Both are currently being tested in preliminary trials . <p> The main problem in leukemia is that immature white blood cells proliferate in the bloodstream , crowding out normal red and white cells . This causes severe anemia and compromises the immune system . But through a hormonal interaction , vitamins A and D seem to make the immature cells grow up . Mature cells appear to stop their rapid reproduction and are able to carry out their immune-system functions . <p> Initially the active form of vitamin D was tested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of causing the body to retain calcium . That could cause complications , including hardening of the vital organs and death . But the synthetic version of vitamin D has a more powerful maturing influence on leukemic cells  --  and a much-lowered calcium-loading mechanism . In studies on leukemic lab mice , this synthetic compound achieved much better results than pure vitamin D. " Some of the mice treated with synthetic D may actually be cured of their leukemia , " reports H. Phillip Koeffler , M.D. , professor of medicine at UCLA and one of the leading researchers in this field . However promising that may sound , further studies need to be done before this compound is tested in humans . <p> Synthetic vitamin A has been tested in humans against leukemia , but not on a widespread scale in this country . A few years ago , American researchers at several centers were involved in a doubleblind , randomized trial of 13-cis retinoic acid ( a retinoid compound ) in patients with a preleukemic condition called myelodysplastic ( MY-low-dis-PLAS-tik ) syndrome . Problems with the study  --  including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results , according to Dr. Koeffler . <p> One of the researchers , however , continued the study on his own after the trial ended , and found a significant response . Was the original trial too short ? It 's hard to say without attempts to duplicate those results . The study also showed physicians that the side effects of retinoid therapy drying can be reduced with doses of vitamin E. More reports have come from abroad . Researchers in China and France have reportedly achieved promising results using transretinoic acid against acute promyelocytic leukemia ( APL ) . Up to 75 percent of patients in Chinese studies went into remission . A French researcher has reportedly duplicated their results . <p> Other research shows that of seven APL patients ( from four different studies ) treated with isotretinoin , four had what a review article termed " remarkable responses . " Clearly ; there 's enougk evidence to warrant further research on both synthetic A and D. FIGHTING WITH FOLATE <p> Leucovorin ( loo-koh-VOR-rin ) is a synthetic form of the B vitamin folate . It 's being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , commonly referred to as 5-FU . Right now 5-FU/leucovorin is in clinical trials against several types of cancer . Researchers hope that someday it may become a standard therapy . <p> By itself , 5-FU has been used against colon cancer for more than 30 years . It interferes with cancer growth by binding to an enzyme needed for cell reproduaion . ( Some cancer cells reproduce much faster than normal cells . That 's how some tumors grow in relation to surrounding tissue . ) But 5-FU alone is only moderately effective . <p> Leucovorin , though , seems to strengthen the bond between 5-FU and the enzyme . The drug/vitamin combination holds onto the enzyme for a longer period than the drug alone . Fewer free enzymes mean slowed or stopped tumor growth . <p> 5-FU/leucovorin has recently passed a series of clinical trials to determine its effectiveness against advanced , inoperable colon cancer . ln five out of seven studies , 5-FU/ leucovorin resulted in tumor shrinkage in two to three times as many patients as 5-FU . In two studies patients lived three to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That may not seem like a giant leap forward , but it paves the way for studies in people with earlier ( and more treatable ) stages of colon cancer . " That 's where we hope to have a real impact on the survival rates , " says Susan G. Arbuck , M.D. , a research clinician at Roswell Park Memorial Institute , in Buffalo , New York . Dr. Arbuck encourages patients who have surgery for colon cancer ( and are at high risk for recurrence ) to participate in the National Cancer Institute high-priority clinical trials for colon and reaal cancer . <p> 5-FU/leucovorin is being tested against a variety of other malignancies , including cancers of the stomach , breast , pancreas , head and neck . To find out more about any of these clinical trials ( including your eligibility if you 've been diagnosed with cancer ) , call the National Cancer Institute hotline : ( 800 ) 4-CANCER . COLORECTAL PROTECTORS ? <p> Colorectal polyps are easy to remove but may recur . That prompted researchers at the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and E on polyp recurrence . <p> Two hundred people who were free of polyps after surgery were split into two groups . One was given daily supplements of 400 milligrams of vitamin C and 400 mg. of vitamin E. The other got blank look-alikes . <p> After about two years , all the patients were checked for polyp recurrence . The researchers noted a slight reduction in polyp recurrence among the patients receiving vitamins C and E. They stressed that further studies should be performed to rule out the possibility that this was a chance finding . <p> A further study is presently under way at six research centers in the United States . About 865 people are enrolled in the trial . The patients are split into four groups : The first gets supplements of vitamins C and E ; the second group gets beta-carotene ( the plant substance our bodies turn into vitamin A ) ; the third gets C , E and beta-carotene ; and the fourth group gets none of the above . Results from this trial are not expected for three years . VITAMIN A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the British Columbia Cancer Research Center , in Vancouver , announced that vitamin A could heal oral leukoplakias ( precancerous sores inside the mouth ) . The study involved 21 people who chew a tobacco and betel-nut mixture known to cause an abundance of leukoplakias . After six months of taking vitamin A supplements , 57 percent of the people showed no detectable disease . And none of the tobacco/betel chewers developed new sores while on the vitamin A. Experts estimate that normally only 5 percent of such sores disappear on their own . <p> Now word comes from the University of California ( Irvine ) Clinical Cancer Center and the University of Arizona Cancer Center that a milder form of vitamin therapy has the same effect . Seventeen people with oral leukoplakias were given beta-carotene . Each person took 30 ma. of supplemental beta-carotene per day for three months . Those whose leukoplakias responded to the treatment were kept on it for an additional three months . <p> At the end of the study , two patients had complete remission of their leukoplakias , and 12 others had partial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change and the other two got worse . Overall , that 's an 82 percent positive response rate . <p> The exciting aspect of this study is that beta-carotene , rhe safest source of vitamin A , was so effective . Pure vitamin A is toxic in high doses , and even the retinoids have unpleasant side effects ( primarily skin problems ) . But beta-carotene is virtually problem-free , even in high doses . That 's because the body converts only as much beta-carotene into vitamin A as is needed at the moment . The excess is excreted harmlessly . WHAT THE GOOD NEWS MEANS <p> Vitamin chemotherapy is a seductive idea : The ultimate goal is an effective natural cancer treatment with no pain and minimal expense . But it 's not quite that simple  --  yet . <p> Scientists are going full bore to see if any of these treatments will turn out to be effective . And even for the vitamins showing the greatest potential , questions of dosage and side effects must be resolved . <p> Note , too , that several of the vitamin therapies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthetic chemical equivalents of folate and vitamin A , respectively . Slight alterations in their chemistry make them more efficient treatments and/or reduce dangerous side effects seen in high doses of the original vitamin . These synthetic vitamins are different enough to be treated as drugs by the Food and Drug Administration . They 're available by prescription only . <p> Until scientists nail down the facts , the best course is to go with what we know . Opt for the proven medical treatments . Have suspected cancer checked by a physician . And try a good defense : There 's good scientific evidence that a healthy diet can help prevent the start of certain types of cancer . To use this evidence to your fullest advantage , eat a well balanced , nutrient-dense diet that is low in fat . This includes low-fat meats and poultry , fish , whole-grain products , . and generous amounts of fresh fruits and vegetables . If you 're on a restricted diet  --  or need added assurance that you 're getting the Recommended Dietary Allowance for vitamins and minerals  --  you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steven Lally <p> VITAMINS VS . BLADDER CANCER : HOW TO BE A PART OF THE RESEARCH <p> Bladder polyps , which can become cancerous , are fairly easy to treat by surgical removal . But mere 's a 70 percent risk of recurrence or that new polyps will form . To prevent that , researchers at Wed Virginia Uni " versity are testing megadoses of four vitamins as an adjunct to conventional therapy after bladder surgery . <p> Patients are being divided into two groups : People in one group take multiple vitamins at the recommended daily alowance levels ; those in the omer group get the same , but with megadoses of vitamins A , B 6 , C and E. Vitamin B 6 has been tested with good results in other preliminary bladder-cancer studies in humans . Vitamins A and C have been tried against bladder cancer in animal studies , will early encouraging re " sults . Vitamin E has n't been tested specifically against bladder polyps before but has shown promise in other cancer tHals . <p> About 120 people are now enrolled in Ws WVU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year , according to Donald L.
