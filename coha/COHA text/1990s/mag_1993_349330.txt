F.W. DE KLERK <P> Q. The announcement of the election suggests the tide of history is running against you and the National Party . <P> A. No , not at all . We 've been in the lead of this process all the time . What is happening is exactly what we envisaged should happen , as the result of our initiatives . We see a major role for ourselves in the future ; we are not liquidating as a political force . The National Party opened its membership to all South Africans a few years ago , and we should no longer be regarded as a party representative of only white South Africans . <P> Q. After next April you do n't expect to be State President ? <P> A. Being State President is n't important . There is already a convergence of opinion that for a period of five years we need a government of national unity , with a form of power sharing among the parties who attain a reasonable percentage of the total vote . There is no doubt that we will be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line that there must be entrenched power sharing at the Executive level in the final constitution ? <P> A. No . We asked for power sharing , and we will get it in the transitional period in a government of national unity . We believe it would be necessary to have a form of power sharing also in terms of a final constitution , but we have a totally open mind as to how that should be structured . I do not think a permanent form of enforced coalition can be written into a final constitution . But we need more than five years to ensure that the various components of our community will all feel secure and that they need not fear suppression or the misuse of power . We must ensure that there will never be domination again in South Africa . I 'm not talking about minority vetoes but about preventing the misuse of power to the detriment of minorities . <P> Q. So you 're not demanding a minority veto ? <P> A. We never stood for a minority veto . To oversimplify it , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote , you do n't get 100% of the power : you get 51% of the power . <P> Q. It sounds like you 're trying to take the prize away from the winner . <P> A. Well , in the U.S. they found ways and means of limiting the power of the Executive to such an extent that the presidency is quite circumscribed . What I am pleading for is that we must move away from the winner-take-all system that we inherited from Great Britain . It works in homogeneous societies , but it is not the right system for a big country with vast regional interests and many language and cultural groups . It is not a question of taking the prize away , but of ensuring that a government wo n't be able to do again what the National Party did with absolute power , merely because it had a majority . <P> Q. Do you ever worry that you 're the South African Gorbachev and that the winds you unleash will blow you aside ? <P> A. No , I do n't think that is a true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a philosophy ; I 'm broadening democracy . It is not as if we are moving from the dark ages where there was no form of democracy suddenly into a new system . I 'm not moving from communism to free-market enterprise . We have a basically sound economy . South Africans have been prepared for the final process of reconciling with each other , of becoming part of one entity and one nation , over a long period .
