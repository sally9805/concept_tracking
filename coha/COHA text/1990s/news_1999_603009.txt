<p> At the end of the decade ( the century and the millennium ) , Oscar will be singing Auld Lang Syne in a decidedly major , not minor , key . <p> After a string of years in which small , edgy , low-budget films began to dominate the ceremony ( remember Sling Blade ? ) and few could distinguish the acting nominees from their next-door neighbors , big studios are back in a big way . <p> Movies that make social statements and boast star power . Movies that have memorable catch phrases such as " Hate put me in prison . Love 's gon na bust me out " ( The Hurricane ) or " What happens on the Mile , stays on the Mile " ( The Green Mile ) . Movies that cost more than your office building . Movies released at the end of the year , the traditional season for quality fare . Movies from studios such as Disney and Warner Bros. whose names you recognize . <p> Little Artisan will have to console itself with the $ 140 million it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oops , Witch Project . Even Amir Malin of Artisan , which has The Limey and Felicia 's Journey , says , " If I were a betting person , I would wager on five best-picture candidates from major studios . The independents may rank 6 , 7 and 8 . " <p> Adds Michael Barker of Sony Pictures Classics , pushing Woody Allen 's Sweet and Lowdown and Pedro Almodovar 's All About My Mother : " There are a lot of intelligent films from studios these days . They have everything from The End of the Affair to The Sixth Sense to American Beauty . The independents are more likely to make an impression in the acting areas . " <p> As far as getting best-picture attention , mentions on year-end Top 10 lists and nods from critics groups will be especially valuable for movies made outside the studio system . <p> " Our job is to get to the dance , " says Scott Greenstein of the newly formed USA Films , which has two of the more formidable indie hopes with Being John Malkovich and Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dance , and people focus on the movies , then we have a shot . " <p> Why are the majors coming on strong ? Could be the cyclical nature of Hollywood or the fact that this year 's Oscars are one landmark contest they did n't want to miss . Whatever the cause , the race looks to be highly competitive , especially since no release has emerged as a Titanic-size front-runner . As Rolling Stone critic Peter Travers puts it : " The office Oscar pool should be much more interesting this year . " <p> Says Terry Press of DreamWorks , whose acclaimed suburban noir American Beauty set the Oscar pace early in the fall : " It 's just like a summer in which 12 movies make $ 90 million instead of two making $ 200 million . It 's healthier . " Not that the big studios planned it this way . " Their goal is to make money . They all have their little divisions to make art films . It was just a roll of the dice this year . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helm . Observes Terry Curtin of Universal , which has three films in the Oscar fight ( biopics The Hurricane , about boxer Rubin Carter , and Man on the Moon , about comic Andy Kaufman ; and literary adaptation Snow Falling on Cedars ) : " There are so many strong directors with releases . And big directors attract big stars . " For Moon , Milos Forman snared Jim Carrey , and for Hurricane , Norman Jewison recruited Denzel Washington . <p> And more and more , studios have been tackling less formulaic scripts . " One of the outstanding developments this year is the feel of an indie film at major studios , " says David Horowitz of Warner Bros. , which has The Green Mile , Any Given Sunday , Three Kings and Liberty Heights . Movies such as Disney 's The Straight Story , about an old man who rides across Iowa atop a lawn mower , or Paramount 's Angela 's Ashes , about a dirt-poor Irish family , could easily have been indie offerings . <p> Those factors , plus lots of high-minded literary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost every likely best-picture candidate has some flaw that could work against it . The Sixth Sense is too popular . Angela 's Ashes is too depressing . American Beauty is too cold . With boyish Matt Damon as a repressed gay killer , The Talented Mr. Ripley is too off-putting . <p> And The Green Mile , which shares many attributes that made 1994 's seven-time nominee The Shawshank Redemption so popular ( director/writer Frank Darabont , a jail setting , Stephen King source material ) , is too long at three hours-plus . <p> As Travers , referring to the inmates ' pet rodent , observes , " If I saw that mouse one more time , I was going to scream . " <p> Other Oscar developments worth a shout : <p> Miramax-ed out . Who could have guessed that for the final Academy Awards of the ' 90s , Miramax , the one-time small distributor that has scored eight best-picture nominees in the past seven years and grew from scrappy art house to quality powerhouse , would offer its weakest slate in ages . <p> This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crying Game , Pulp Fiction and The English Patient may have to make do with the foreign rights to The Talented Mr. Ripley , distributed domestically by Paramount . " It 's our best contender , " says Mark Gill of Miramax , whose push for John Irving 's adaptation of his The Cider House Rules seems to be fizzling . <p> Even he acknowledges that " this is the best year for quality from the majors in the past 10 . The range , the diversity is seen in every movie coming out . Two things are happening . Audiences are saying they do n't want retreads or stupid movies . And studios do want to be part of the academy race . " <p> Perhaps Miramax co-chiefs Harvey and Bob Weinstein are pooped out from multiple victories by last year 's best picture Shakespeare in Love and Italian import Life Is Beautiful Though their company is as admired for its promotion abilities as it is for its films , not everyone will be upset if they sit this one out . Many thought Miramax took aggressive PR to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DreamWorks ( Saving Private Ryan ) over pricey Oscar campaigns . <p> As New York magazine critic Peter Rainer says , " Maybe we will be spared the full-page ads in Italian . " <p> To Oscars and beyond ? The biggest surprise may not be if an indie sneaks in but whether one of the year 's most successful films does . With critical clout and big box office , do n't count out Toy Story 2 . It would be only the second animated feature in the best-picture lineup , after 1989 's Beauty and the Beast . <p> Even those at rival studios think the Disney ' toon has what it takes to woo the voters . Says DreamWorks ' Press , " It does n't have a chance to win , but it 's a perfect movie to be nominated . It could get what I call the Babe nomination . " <p> Trouble is , actors  --  the 5,500-member academy 's largest voting branch  --  usually do n't like to nominate movies that do n't feature humans onscreen . Jobwise , " it makes them nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long-form animation is so popular , Rainer suggests adding a companion category to the animated shorts . " It would be particularly appropriate this year with Toy Story 2 , Tarzan , The Iron Giant , Princess Mononoke and South Park . " <p> But Disney exec Richard Cook is willing to take his chances against live action . " Movies should be evaluated for being movies , regardless of form or format , " he says . <p> In a Disney whirl . And who would have predicted that ultra-commercial Disney , which bought Miramax in 1993 , would have enough highly admired releases this year to virtually fill the five best-picture slots all by itself  --  The Sixth Sense , The Insider , The Straight Story , Toy Story 2 , Cradle Will Rock . And no one would argue if they did . This from a company that has never won a best-picture statue . <p> As Cook understates : " We are n't known as a studio that puts out a lot of academy material . " Let 's not go crazy , though . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biz as usual . <p> The sharing game . Titanic was n't just a win for Paramount ; 20th Century Fox , which owns the foreign rights , also benefited from the awards boost . Similarly , Universal shared in Miramax 's Shakespeare in Love victory . <p> The practice of supposedly competing studios sharing the costs of a blockbuster like Twister has been going on for a while . But more Oscar-quality films are being co-distributed this year . Besides Miramax and Paramount sharing Ripley , Universal has a part of both The Green Mile and Angela 's Ashes . And Disney has a piece of The Hurricane . <p> " The studios are getting in bed with each other , " says Premiere magazine 's Anne Thompson . " It 's an interesting question of who gets the bragging rights . " <p> Universal 's Curtin says the etiquette is simple . " You share every dollar . But usually the domestic distributor toots its horn the loudest at Oscar time . With Titanic , there was double tooting , " which may happen again if Ripley makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in Ripley . " After all , director Anthony Minghella ( The English Patient ) , Damon and Gwyneth Paltrow " are all Miramax rep players . " <p> Paramount 's Rob Friedman concurs . " We have a terrific relationship with Miramax . We consider them fully our partners . And I would be a silly man not to take advantage of a person 's expertise like Harvey Weinstein 's and the Miramax crew . " <p> Still , there could be some unexpected choices when the ceremonies are held March 26 . Like , what if John Malkovich were to be nominated for being John Malkovich ? Says Travers on behalf of the actor 's preening self portrait : " It finally explains his performances in things like Rounders . " <p> And the best-picture winner might be . . . <p> With most of the major contenders already screened for critics groups and year-end list makers , here are the likeliest best-picture nominees at this point . <p> But with no clear-cut front-runner yet , anything could happen by the time ballots go out to academy members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Angela 's Ashes <p> The Talented Mr. Ripley <p> The Sixth Sense <p> If any of those fall by the wayside , these titles are likely substitutes : The Hurricane , Being John Malkovich , Toy Story 2 , Topsy-Turvy , The Insider , The Straight Story , Man on the Moon , Magnolia , All About My Mother , Boys Do n't Cry . <p> Who 's likely and who 's a long shot <p> Tom Cruise is back in the risky business of acting in his underwear . Tom Hanks is once more a leader among men . And as if women 's lib were but a mere figment , almost every major actress  --  from vets such as Meryl Streep to unknowns such as Janet McTeer  --  is playing some manner of matriarch. 1999 will be a year to remember for great male performances .
