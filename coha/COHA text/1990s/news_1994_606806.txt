<p> CAROLYN RILEY was back for her fourth visit , and on this trip she brought her 10-year-old daughter . Marla Eby came first years ago with her mother , who had loved the book and insisted she see the movie . Eby returned now with her 9-month-old daughter . I was on my third visit , this time with my toddler daughter , a few years after bringing my mother . <p> What drew all of us to bring our little women to quiet brown Orchard House in Concord , Mass. ? The chance to visit the place where we all grew up  --  the home of Louisa May Alcott , author of " Little Women , " a book many people pick up as children and never really put down . <p> When I was 8 , I found my mother 's old copy of " LW . " By the time I hit 9 , I could quote most of the first chapter from memory and my parents despaired of me ever reading anything else . Of course , I did : " Little Men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alcott 's children 's works . " Little Women " was first and best , and remains true because Alcott drew her tale of four sisters  --  Meg , Jo , Beth and AmyQdirectly from life . <p> Now is a good time to visit the house where Louisa wrote the chapters of our early lives . " Little Women " comes out again as a movie on Christmas Day . The film 's producers consulted the Orchard House staff to design the set for the film , but the house endures beyond Hollywood as a history of an intricate family love and an unquenchable creative spirit . Not only that , it 's a great place for true Louisa fans to get in a good wallow . <p> I still laugh and sob over " LW , " but Orchard House introduces a far more complex truth about its prototypes . Louisa ( Jo ) was a stormy , strong-willed woman whose juvenile books made her famous but took her away from the adult psychological fiction she wanted to write . She prized freedom but devoted her life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her family , especially her mother . Louisa loved them all fiercely , but was nothing like her gentler , older sister , Anna ( Meg ) , and was divided between great affection and jealousy for her youngest sister , May ( Amy ) , an acclaimed artist . Bronson Alcott , their father , was a philosopher and leader of the Transcendental movement . His pursuit of the ideal left his family broke and almost constantly on the move before they landed at Orchard House in 1858 . <p> The house still has the comfortable sense that the family has just stepped out . The tour lasts at least an hour , partly because the guides are as loopy about Louisa as the visitors and are glad to talk . The rooms are not roped off , so you can poke your nose right in ( no touching , of course , and no cameras are allowed inside ) . <p> You do n't have to have " LW " engraved on your heart to appreciate the house , which stands on its own as a museum of 19th-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beth 's piano ! " " The mood pillow ! " " The russet boots ! " They are all in the book and their originals are all in the house . But if you are a true believer , oh my , you can wander in a kind of bliss . You see what Louisa described in the beginning of " LW " : " a comfortable old room , though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain ; for a good picture or two hung on walls , books filled the recesses . . . and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it . " The lower floor includes the dining room , with Lizzie 's melodeon ( Beth 's piano ) . Walking into the second-story room where Louisa quickly wrote " LW " is like melting into the photograph of her at work : You feel intrusive for blundering into the author 's domain . May 's room is soft gray and blue , as Amy 's would be . The artist considered the entire house her canvas  --  her drawings are preserved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The family portraits give the house its immediacy . Everyone is well represented in paintings and photographs that give faces to characters you already know so well . There are two that capture Louisa . Downstairs is a painting done in her thirties , one she said made her look ghastly . It is my favorite . Her gaze is direct and reflects a life in which success was balanced by much loss . That portrait makes the photograph upstairs look almost heartbreaking in its youthful bravado . In that one particularly are the " decided mouth , a comical nose , and sharp , grey eyes , which appeared to see everything . . . . Her long thick hair was her one beauty , " Alcott 's description of herself as Jo . Of special interest is the one image of Lizzie , who died as a young woman just before the family came to Orchard House and is the least known of the sisters . <p> Louisa often lived in Boston while the family was at Apple Slump , her name for Orchard House . Concord made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday night we were there , Main Street was dark . But it 's a beautiful , well-preserved village dating to the 1600s and it makes for a good historic and literary weekend , with its connections to the Revolution , Emerson , Thoreau and Hawthorne . You can pay your respects to Louisa , and to much of 19th-century thought , at Sleepy Hollow Cemetery . Up a steep hill there is Author 's Ridge , where the famous rest . <p> About 30,000 people a year visit Orchard House , says its executive director , Stephanie Upton  --  who received the " Little Women " series at birth . Upton , whose grandmother made regular pilgrimages to the house , says it has an allure that crosses and binds generations . Carolyn Riley , whose daughter wants to be a writer , said on her fourth visit , " I know I 'll be back again . " She likes the sense that Louisa 's spirit is there , just out of reach . Marla Eby , whose mother made the family watch the Katharine Hepburn version of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a single thread . <p> I know I 'll return when my daughter , who shares Louisa 's Nov. 29 birthday , is older . I want the two of them to meet more formally . We can come back any time : Orchard House is open year-round in Concord and forever in the pages of " Little Women .
