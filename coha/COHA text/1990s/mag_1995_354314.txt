1 SMASHING PUMPKINS Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness ( Virgin ) . Raucous and sweet , pretentious and populist , this Chicago-based alternative rock group 's hubristic double CD soared as high as its lofty ambitions , an Icarus with wings that worked . Bandleader Billy Corgan is adept at turning out swift , radio-ready hits , yet he also excels at creating epic art-pop songs that explore enigmatic ideas and twisting melodic pathways . For listeners looking to take a journey , not just a joyride , this is a trip that should n't be missed . <P> 2 ALISON KRAUSS Now That I 've Found You ( Rounder ) . With this greatest-hits CD , the mass audience found Krauss , a fiddle and viola prodigy with a soprano voice as clear and invigorating as a mountain stream . Her taste ranges from country spirituals to pop standards by the Beatles and the Foundations . No gimmicks here , just down-home virtuosity . <P> 3 BRUCE SPRINGSTEEN The Ghost of Tom Joad ( Columbia ) . Drained of the arena-rock testosterone and bourgeois guilt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explores the lives of steelworkers , illegal immigrants and migrant farmers . The Boss is gone , and Bruce is back among the proletariat . <P> 4 THE CHIEFTAINS The Long Black Veil ( RCA ) . Ireland 's favorite sextet comes to call , the pipes and flutes and fiddles and all , with a breakthrough album after only thirtysomething years together . Paddy Moloney 's charts for vocalists from Ireland ( Van Morrison ) , England ( Sting ) , Wales ( Tom Jones ) and Scotland ( Mark Knopfler ) do more than revive a splendid set of ancient airs . They are delicious dirges that could wake the dead . Keen music ! <P> 5 VARIOUS ARTISTS Color and Light : Jazz Sketches on Sondheim ( Sony Classical ) . High-energy Broadway show music meets low-key cool jazz on this sleek , satisfying album , as such top performers as bassist Christian McBride and trumpeter Terence Blanchard sensuously redefine and rejuvenate the work of Broadway composer Stephen Sondheim . <P> 6 ERNESTO LECUONA The Complete Piano Music , Vol. 1 ( Bis ) . Everybody knows Lecuona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more than that to the prolific Cuban composer , who died in 1963 . Fingers ablaze , pianist Thomas Tirino eloquently makes the case . <P> 7 SKUNK ANANSIE Paranoid &; Sunburnt ( Epic/One Little Indian ) . This British quartet , one of the few hard-rock bands fronted by a black woman , boasts a scaldingly bold sound , mixing chunks of punk , bits of R. and B. and even a dash of gospel in its joyously fierce debut album . <P> 8 MARIAH CAREY Daydream ( Columbia ) . Carey is a hitmaking , money-generating corporation ; her sometimes overemoted songs have in the past sounded like a musical interpretation of a bull market . Her new album is different : the vocals are subtler , the melodies more restrained , the lyrics more artful . Carey may be big business , but artistically her stock is on the rise . <P> 9 PUCCINI La Boheme ( Erato ) . Conductor Kent Nagano restores the freshness and bloom to Puccini 's heart-tugging tale of young love won and lost . Soprano Kiri Te Kanawa as Mimi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
