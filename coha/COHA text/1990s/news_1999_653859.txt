<p> As high-technology business strategies go , it was a classic , perfectly executed : find a technological " discontinuity , " race a new product to market and dislodge an entrenched competitor . <p> That is precisely what Greg Galanos , the founder of the tiny software company Metrowerks Inc. did back in 1991 . Realizing that Apple Computer and the Motorola Corporation were allying with I.B.M . to shift to a new microprocessor chip called the Power PC ( the discontinuity ) , he quickly developed a type of software tool known as a compiler ( the new product ) for use by programmers writing software for Apple Macintosh Power PC computers . <p> When the dust settled , Mr. Galanos found that his Code Warrior compiler software had a 95 percent share of the market for Apple Macintosh programming tools . The dislodged competitor in this case was the larger , less nimble Symantec Corporation . <p> Unfortunately , there was just one flaw in the strategy : Metrowerks had seized the commanding lead of a shrinking market . The grand alliance that Apple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the personal computer market began to collapse from a peak of about 13 percent to around 3 percent , where it bottomed out last year . <p> Metrowerks ' compiler software continued to play a crucial role , enabling programmers who designed applications for the Macintosh to covert their instructions to machine language . Trouble was , fewer programmers were interested in creating new Macintosh applications . <p> Undeterred , Mr. Galanos scanned the horizon for the next big technological discontinuity . And the 41-year-old Metrowerks president may have found it : the increasing fragmentation of computing from its desktop-PC foundation to a new , pebbly terrain of digital consumer electronics devices that include video game machines and " smart " voice and data cellular telephones . <p> Compared with three years ago , when Metrowerks was developing software entirely for the Macintosh , 60 percent of the company 's projected $30 million in revenue this year will come from sales for software tools used to program the processor chips that are at the heart of the consumer electronics market . <p> This coming post-PC era , as it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the software giant Microsoft , which currently leads the esoteric but crucial market for software tools  --  the programs that programmers themselves use when creating software . Microsoft , with more than $200 million in annual tool sales , is the leader in this field because it sells the primary tools used in making programs for the industry-dominating Microsoft Windows PC operating system . <p> But the post-PC shift toward computerized consumer electronics products  --  which employ many different operating systems and so require many different kinds of programming tools  --  is creating a new opportunity for a raft of smaller software tool makers . <p> Besides Metrowerks , the noteworthies include Cygnus , Greenhills Software , Imprise , Integrated Systems and Wind River Systems . But none of these other companies offer the range of products across different chip families that Metrowerks does . <p> And Metrowerks has distinguished itself by making significant inroads in the market for hand-held computing and wireless devices . The company is the leading software tools vendor for the popular Palm Pilot organizer . And Metrowerks recently struck a deal with Motorola to provide software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for digital cellular phones and similar computerized communications devices . <p> Metrowerks ' biggest coup , though , has come in the video game field . All three of the major game makers  --  Nintendo , Sega and Sony  --  have announced that their next generation of game machines scheduled for release later this year will use chips and operating systems that rely on Metrowerks software development tools . <p> Having a single software development environment is something that is highly prized by video game developers , who must gamble on which system will be most popular and then be prepared to quickly rewrite , or " port , " their programs to a competitor 's gaming system . In this case , it also means that any developer creating games for these new machines will have to use Metrowerks tool kits . It is perhaps the most valuable validation yet for the strategy that Mr. Galanos and Metrowerks are now pursuing . <p> " We 're in the business of creating developer communities around post-PC devices , " Mr. Galanos said in his office in Cupertino , Calif . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Metrowerks ' strategy is a concept akin to Microsoft 's practice of offering outside programmers the company 's applications programming interfaces , or A.P.I. 's  --  computer-code pathways into and out of the operating system to which programmers connect their software . Carrying this idea to consumer electronics , Metrowerks is now finishing work on a tool kit  --  called Powerparts  --  that is supposed to make it simple to adapt programs for one type of device for use on another device , as well as offering programmers a library for quickly creating visual control panels for consumer devices . A scheduling program created for a hand-held electronic organizer , for instance , might be easily translated to a version used on a smart cell phone with a screen . <p> With Metrowerks having established its bona fides in the Macintosh tools market , and now gathering steam in the post-PC market , Mr. Galanos is finding enthusiastic supporters from many parts of the computer industry  --  particularly among executives who like nothing better than to see upstarts flying successfully beneath Microsoft 's radar . <p> " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Microsoft positioning , " said Eric Schmidt , chairman and chief executive of the Novell Corporation , a leading network software company and Microsoft competitor . " And he 's done it with good products in a difficult market . " <p> Although compilers are remarkably complex programs that are largely invisible to typical computer users , they play a crucial role in the computing world . The quality of a compiler can determine how quickly programs run , how easy is it to write programs and whether those programs are more or less error free . And a fast compiler can sharply improve a programmer 's efficiency  --  no small consideration , since complex programs might contain millions of lines of programming instructions . <p> " If you impact the efficiency of software development , then you impact time to market , " Mr. Galanos said . " And time to market is everything today . " <p> So far , however , the company 's forward momentum has not carried over to its balance sheet or stock price . <p> Although revenues have followed an upward trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has eked out profits in only four financial quarters since the beginning of fiscal 1996 . And any gains have been more than offset by the losses during that stretch , as the company has invested heavily in its new strategy . Investors , meanwhile , have shown little appetite for Metrowerks ' shares , which were trading above $9 in early 1998 , but closed last Friday at $3 . <p> " The market has n't been good for small and micro-cap stocks , " said David Kaminer , an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities in Montreal . " But now their strategy is paying off in market positioning , " he said of Metrowerks , " and I expect profitability to return soon . " <p> In contrast to many other software wunderkinds like William Gates and Steve Jobs , who embraced computers as teen-agers , Mr. Galanos came relatively late to this line of work . At age 17 , after dropping out of high school , Mr. Galanos left his native Australia in 1974 , and for the next two years traveled by foot , bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountering unfriendly Khmer Rouge soldiers in Laos in 1975 . <p> " I was in Vientiane , and American tourists were the targets for roaming soldiers , " he recalled . To ease his discreet withdrawal from Laos , he said , " I quickly added an Australian flag to my backpack and threw greenbacks at the soldiers at all the roadblocks . " <p> Ultimately , his wandering took him to Montreal , where he settled in 1976 and became a self-taught programmer working for the electric utility Hydro-Quebec . While there , he became manager of the environment department , where despite a a ban on the use of non-I.B.M. personal computers he orchestrated the covert rental of Macintosh computers by the department 's scientists . By the time the accountants discovered his ploy in early 1985 , the group had one of the largest Macintosh networks then in existence  --  some 60 of the machines . <p> It was not until the age of 28 that Mr. Galanos started college , studying computer science at the University of Quebec , in Montreal . <p> He became intrigued with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who invented both the Pascal and Modula programming languages , and after graduating , Mr. Galanos founded Metropolis Computer Networks in 1986 as a company that sold a Modula compiler to colleges and universities . <p> The modest success of that business attracted the interest of a French venture capitalist , Jean Belanger , who supplied $100,000 of financing in 1989 that helped Mr. Galanos found Metrowerks as a more broadly based tools provider  --  a relationship that eventually resulted in Mr. Belanger 's becoming chief executive three years ago , freeing Mr. Galanos , still president , to also become chief technology officer . <p> As the Macintosh tool kit started taking off , Mr. Galanos took the company public in 1994 and subsequently moved Metrowerks to Austin , Tex. , to be closer to the locus of Power PC chip development and to take advantage of the engineering labor pool in that emerging technopolis . <p> Several years later he set up an office for himself and a small group of the company 's best programmers in Cupertino , in Silicon Valley , to be close to customers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a difficult one . But he says he is confident that Metrowerks will return to profitability this year , now that its new business model is taking hold . <p> Certainly , having spotted the next big discontinuity , he is banking on his Powerparts strategy to turn Metrowerks into a major player in the post-PC world . <p> " It 's been a very long and arduous task to transition from being a Mac company , " he said . " You suck it in , invest a lot in R &D,; and push to make sales catch up . " <p> http : //www.nytimes.com
