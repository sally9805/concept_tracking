IF YOU HAPPEN TO BE A PROFESSIONAL BASS TOURNAMENT ANGLER , STOP READING . THE FOLLOWING KILLER BASS FISHING METHOD IS NOT FOR YOU ! Forget for a few moments the tactics that professional bass anglers tout for catching prized largemouths and smallmouths . There is one method they ca n't endorse , mainly because it 's off-limits to the pros . And it very well could be the most effective way to take bass  --  period . It 's trolling , a method so good that it 's been banned by most professional bass tournament organizations . In fact , in the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society ( B.A.S.S. ) 1992-93 BASS Master Tournament regulations , Rule No. 9 clearly states : " Trolling as a method of fishing is prohibited . " So that leaves it to us amateurs to capitalize on this simple , yet sure-fire method of hooking lunkers nearly every time out . " I encourage all my clients to troll because trolling consistently produces more bass than casting and retrieving does , " said Jack Wingate , nationally known bass fishing guide on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age or skill level , fishermen can catch bass on most days they troll . " Wingate trolls artificial lures for bass . However , trolling is just as effective for live-bait fishermen . " I troll live shiners during the winter months to cover more water and catch bigger bass , " explained Buck Bray , a professional bass fishing guide on the Withlacoochee River near Dunnellon , Florida . Most anglers agree that trolling will produce numbers of fish for even inexperienced fishermen , but does it catch trophy-size bass ? Consider this : The world 's record small-mouth bass , which weighed 11 pounds 15 ounces , was caught on a Bomber Mud Bug by David Hayes in 1955 while he was trolling at Dale Hollow Lake on the Tennessee/Kentucky border . I discovered this bassing technique as a 5-year-old , fishing with my Dad in a boat made of cypress that we rented for 50c a day . The boat was powered by the fastest motor on the river at that time  --  a Wizard 3-1/2 hp . Using an iron rod and braided nylon line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader tied to the last hook and a silver spoon attached on the end of the leader . All day long we trolled the banks of the Warrior River , close to my home in central Alabama , and caught numbers of bass , a few crappies and an occasional catfish . The same strategy would undoubtedly work today . SELECTING SPEED During the winter months the metabolism of bass slows down , so the fish will not chase baitfish as readily as in the spring and summer . For this reason , slow trolling either live baits or artificial lures often will produce more bass in the winter months than any other method of bass fishing . In the spring and fall , when bass feed much more actively and are willing to chase baits , fast-trolled crankbaits such as Cotton Cordell 's Spot lures or Bill Lewis ' Rat-L-Traps often will produce the most bass . By changing the speed at which you troll , you also can vary the segment of water through which lures pass . Early in the morning when the bass are shallow , fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep lures such as a Rat-L-Trap in the shallow water where the bass are feeding . Later in the day slow troll . Not only reduce the speed of your trolling motor , but also lower the rod tip , keeping the rod parallel to the water . Consider even using a smaller , stiffer rod , such as a 5-1/2-footer , to get line and lure down quicker to the deeper water bass . So remember , trolling is a deadly tactic and can be employed at any time of the year on almost any body of water . It allows you to fish many segments of the water , while varying your strategies according to the wind , weather and water conditions . If you want to catch more bass , try trolling . The pros most certainly would  --  if they were allowed . BOTTOM WALKING A highly productive tactic involves a trolling rig such as the old Gapen Bait-Walker , which is simply a piece of lead attached to two spinnerbait-like wires . The bottom wire holds the lead . On the top wire , a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of lures can be used : a crankbait , live bait , an in-line spinner or a jig . ( See illustration above . ) ( Illustration omitted ) Slowly trolled , this rig keeps the bait near or on the bottom and in the bass ' strike zone . To fish higher up off the bottom with the Bait-Walker rig , use a floater/diver type lure such as the Rebel Silver minnow , the Rapala minnow , the Wiggle Wart or any similar crankbait . Using this rig , anglers can troll a bait at almost any depth of water . TROLLING POINTS AND BANKS Any expert will tell you that when starting out on a lake or river you 've never fished before , the best spots to fish for bass are along points . Using trolling tactics , you can fish every segment of water on points and locate bass . Begin trolling at the deepest end and the deepest sides of the underwater point using deep-diving crankbaits ( A ) . Bagley 's DB-3 , Mann 's 30+ and Double Deep Rebels are good choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 inches of eight-pound to 12-pound-test line to the back hook of the crankbait . Attach a small , in-line spinner like the Mepps , Panther Martin or Rooster Tail to the other end of the line . Using this trailer rig , you double your odds of taking smallmouth , largemouth and/or spotted bass by presenting the fish with two different sizes and colors of lures . Next move up to the middle of the point ( B ) , and troll medium-depth crankbaits . Finally , go into the shallow water close to the bank ( C ) , tie on your shallow-running crankbaits and troll . As you move into shallow water , you can eliminate the trailer lure . Similarly , riverbank trolling ( D ) is one of the best ways to locate big bass that may be holding on structure so small a depth finder wo n't show it . But trolling banks is not only a tactic for taking bass in natural rivers ; this technique also catches plenty of bass in large impoundments when you troll the edges of the underwater riverbanks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , highland reservoir lakes and the deep , clear lakes of the West , trolling a deep-diving crankbait with a trailer lure such as a silver spoon or any in-line spinner will produce largemouth , smallmouth and spotted bass . One of the problems associated with catching bass in these deep , clear lakes is that bass often hold in the underwater caves and cracks in the sheer rock bluffs . If you cast to the bank , your bait falls away from the region where the bass are holding . However , when you troll in front of those bluffs , the bass in these underwater caves , cracks and caverns have time to see your bait , come away from their ambush points and attack the lure . TROLLING HUMPS Other good trolling areas in any lake are humps . In many sections of the country , underwater humps in manmade reservoirs actually are Indian mounds left from the earliest days of our country . Before the reservoirs were inundated , archaeological teams often dug large trenches through the mounds to learn about the people who lived in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mounds and wait to attack baitfish . Trolling deep-diving crankbaits puts a lure down on the mounds . When the bait passes over the trench , the bass will often come out and attack . Trolling the outside edges of these areas will also produce bass . VEGETATION TROLLING If you 're on a lake or a river filled with aquatic vegetation , try trolling live bait . Large minnows , golden shiners and other big baitfish trolled along the edges of the grass will pull big bass out of their hiding spots . " I use a weedless hook and lip hook the shiners , " Buck Bray advises . " Then I troll slowly along the edges of lily pads , peppergrass , hydrilla , milfoil and other kinds of water weeds to catch big bass . " When a bass hits the minnow , do n't immediately set the hook . A large , live bait often will be taken sideways in the bass ' mouth , so you must give the fish time to fully take the bait . Instead , point the rod straight at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hook . TROLLING TAILRACE Tailrace areas below dams generally hold the largest concentrations of fish in any reservoir . In cool-water reservoirs , you 'll frequently find big smallmouths as well as largemouths holding in the tailraces . John Hill , a smallmouth specialist who fishes the tailrace at Wheeler Dam near Town Creek , Alabama , explains , " Smallmouth bass either will hold close to the dam or well away from the dam in a tailrace area . But locating smallmouths can be difficult , depending on how many turbines are running . " I troll a Model A Bomber back and forth across the current from near the dam to one-quarter-mile below the dam . Using this tactic , I can pinpoint smallmouths and consistently catch them by trolling . " BELLY BOATING PONDS An often overlooked spot for catching big bass when trolling is farm ponds . These ponds usually have less fishing pressure , more productive bass habitat and more food in them than rivers and reservoirs do . Because putting a boat in a farm pond may be difficult , Dr. Bob Sheppard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pays big bass dividends for him  --  belly boating . Holding his seven-foot rod straight up , Sheppard uses his swim fins to power him and his tube around the farm pond . When a bass hits Sheppard 's bait  --  usually the biggest minnows he can find in the bait shop  --  Sheppard drops his rod tip , sets the hook and swims backwards furiously to ensure a solid hook set and to keep the slack out of his line . Sheppard catches good numbers of bass , some weighing more than five pounds , in the spring and summer by belly boat trolling . <p>
