People had called Edward Jay Elson " Pop " ever since 1952 , when at twenty-eight he was promoted from journeyman lineman to pusher on the 300 KVA line they were stringing down the Feather River Canyon from the new Caribou hydro station . Now newly into his seventies , a tall , lean man whose shock of white hair and weathered face at last suited the nickname , he continued to display the good nature that had earned it . He was " Pop " because of his paternal care for the men who worked for him as he rose through the blue collar ranks in Pacific Gas and Electric ; a nice guy who had paid his way in the world with quiet , unassuming kindness . <p> Which , he supposed  --  being a man of self-knowledge but limited religious conviction  --  made it a balancing of scales according to some vast eternal plan , that he be rewarded for a life of modest good works with the sudden removal of the cancerous tumor that had grown long undetected in the dark of his groin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  God or Nature or simply The Way Things Are  --  the proximate instrument of his sudden return to health was a small , golden cylinder held with sure purpose in the six-fingered left hand of one of the three little guys with bald and bulbous heads and luminous kid eyes who , late on a March Saturday afternoon , sucked him up from his Sears aluminum bass boat into their strange , organic craft , one toroidal end of which hovered briefly over a snaky little inlet of Lake Oroville . <p> " Thing like one of those little Magna-Lite flashlights , " he told Amie Heckshire at nine-thirty on the following Saturday morning in the storefront clubroom on Third Street in Oroville 's shabby old downtown . " Except it was kind a gold colored and hummed . " The ancient Wurlitzer in the comer writhed purple and played a mournful Crystal Gayle . <p> " Yeah , right , " said Arnie , a friend of fifty years and fellow member of the Retired Men 's Social Club &; Ladies ' Auxiliary . He was not a morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow shoulders and tugged the belt on his Expansoslacks up over his prolapsed abdomen , " Okay , I 'll bite . What 's the gag ? " <p> " I 'm not kiddin ' . It really happened . " Pop 's voice was low , intense , his face serious . He pulled the front of his blue polo shirt free from his pants , unbuckled them , and slipped the waistband down over a pelvis still flat and hard to reveal in the dim morning light of the barroom a small , pink , puckering blemish . <p> " Shit , " said Arnie , shaking his head to scoff away his growing credulity . " Looks like a goddamn hickey , like where maybe Marianne bit you , you been doin ' that kind a thing lately . " If Pop 's tale was even partly true , Arnie was hurt that Pop had n't confided his affliction . <p> Pop accepted Arnie 's sour skepticism . It was certainly justifiable . He shrugged , tucked in his shirt , and began to fill the sink behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century of conversation , Arnie was pretty sure he knew truth from trash when it came from Pop . But disbelief is a faith slow to die . He said almost nothing for the next two hours as the two went about their chores in the club 's help-yourself bar , now illuminated only by one bare ceiling bulb , the Wurlitzer working its way through its stack on automatic , and a gleam of morning sun coming in above the cracked black paint on the street-side display windows . <p> The club was the social focus for a few dozen elderly people of modest means who wanted a place away from the TV set to talk about the sins of their kids , the virtues of their grandchildren , the follies of those sonsabitches in Washington , and their discomfort with change , any kind of change . They could play a little penny-ante or gin and drink a couple of unlicensed beers at lower than barroom prices . They knew they had a uniquely good thing going but all was contingent on the benign neglect of the Alcoholic Beverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no paid employees . <p> And so in teams of two , the members took turns tending bar , cleaning up the place , buying and storing stock , and seeing to rent and maintenance . This week it was Pop and Arnie 's turn to share the morning clean-up after a busy Friday night . They washed the glassware , swept up the litter left by the forty-five club members and their friends and relatives , including auxiliaries , cased the empties , wiped down the two dozen battered tables , and restocked the cooler . <p> Finished half an hour before the next duo would arrive to open the club for the day , they sat on adjoining bar stools  --  an elderly Mutt and Jeff  --  to have a first beer . Arnie took a long pull on his bottle of Anchor Steam to wash down Pop 's story , and broke his long silence : " Jeez , Pop . You are n't kiddin ' are you . " <p> " Nope . " Pop expected skepticism , could himself hardly believe what had happened was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the scar and the featureless X-ray on Monday at the clinic , and the guys in the white coats with stethoscopes around their necks shaking their heads and muttering stuff about must be some mistake , wrong file . <p> " So , " said Arnie . " Din it hurt ? <p> " Nah . They kept their thumbs outta the way . " <p> " Shit . Do n't joke me , man . I mean you ! " <p> Pop shook his head . " Nothin ' . No blood , no pain . Like you can see , not hardly any scar . And no friggin ' bill ! " <p> " Medicare covered it , hey ? " <p> " No ! I mean there was no charge . They done it for free , only asked me to , you know , kinda pass the word . " <p> This last was too much for Arnie . He took another long pull on his beer . " You mean they want to do more  --  uh  --  operations ? " <p> " What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em more people need something taken out ? " <p> " Guess so . " <p> " And you 're telling me all this . . . ? " <p> Pop drained his bottle , head thrown back , Adam 's apple bobbing . Empty back on the old galvanized sheet metal bar with a solid clunk . " Ah , " he said . " Yeah . I 'm telling you most of all ' cause you are n't worth a cup fulla cold piss but you 're about the oldest and best friend I got and , basically , who else is gon na believe something as fuckin ' weird as this ? And second I know you got that prostate thing worries you and . . . " He paused to find an afterthought that would mask emotion . " . . . hell , I promised those guys that were in , you know , in that thing over the lake , that I 'd find other customers for ' em . " <p> Arnie was deeply touched by Pop 's concern for him , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Customers ! You said customers ! Somebody buyin ' something from somebody . So what 's the deal ? Whaddaya pay ' em in , some kinda Klingon goodies outta that Star Trek show ? They after  --  ah  --  earthling nooky ? You got some a those girls from over at , like , Monique 's Massage and Manicure out there in your bass boat ? " <p> " No , " said Pop quietly . " Said all they wanted was to keep the parts . Whatever they took out you did n't need anymore . Said they were . . . harvesting . " <p> Patsy Cline fell to pieces on the Wurlitzer . <p> Late that afternoon , feeling foolish , half expecting a bunch of giggling people from the club to show up on one of those party houseboats they rent at the marina , Arnie sat waiting in the bow of Pop 's battered boat as Pop , trolling motor humming just enough to counter a gentle eddy , sat in the stern , half-heartedly casting a plastic rattlin ' lunger into the weeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arnie said , " I would n't a done this except the guy at the Elderclinic , that black doc , he told me it was probably gon na be surgery , and odds on gettin ' it up afterwards ai n't all that hot . " <p> " All you think of ? " said Pop , trying to make light . <p> " Well I ai n't ready to hang it up yet , Pop . " <p> " Yeah . Course you 're not , " said Pop , sympathy in his voice . " Nobody ever is , and I think you 're smart for takin ' a shot at this . I mean , what do any of us our age have to lose ? Lot of people , young guys , I mean when I was a young guy , I figured when you 're up in your sixties , up there , and you 're on retirement and the kids 're gone and the damn dog has died and you 're sittin ' back takin ' it easy , well you quit worryin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , but  --  yeah  --  the pension 's okay and the social security helps a lot and we got the doublewide paid for and it is kinda easy street , and Marianne and me , we still have a round and round she goes every once in a while . So hell , I do n't blame you gettin ' shook about what that guy , that black doc told you . I would of too , it was me . " <p> Modesty did not permit him to tell Arnie of his first post-operative week when , unworried for the first time in months by the thing growing in his groin , he had chased a giggling Marianne around the doublewide more than once . He retrieved his hook and switched to a fresh angel fly . The boat shivered briefly . He looked up and Arnie was gone , just like that . <p> Although Arnie 's puckery little pink scar was not in a place where he could show it to others , or indeed see it himself without some uncomfortable contortions and a hand mirror borrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs that magnifies ; the first view , pucker or no , horrifying him  --  he was a satisfied customer . <p> Once again , the Elderclinic provided confirmation . Arnie turned his head and coughed , the black doc withdrew his gloved finger and shook his head and ordered a new round of X-rays . Arnie dressed , went down the hall to the sign that said " X-ray " with an arrow pointing left , and turned right , a spring in his step . Home again , he shared his good news with his Louella , who received it with mixed but on the whole positive emotions and who quickly shared the tale with a couple of other auxiliary ladies . <p> Word spread in the club . By Memorial Day , Pop had ferried nine more people out to the inlet : Annie Hague with the lump in her left breast , Chuck Binder with the growth they said probably was n't cancerous yet but we 'd better do a biopsy anyway and watch it , Sandy Teeters and the thing in his colon , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ask . Every Saturday afternoon for two and a half months , he had sat in rain and sun , wind and calm , fishing  --  almost always without catching anything worth keeping  --  while the harvest went on and the membership of the Retired Men 's Social Club &; Ladies ' Auxiliary grew progressively healthier , progressively more satisfied with things just the way they were . <p> By the 4th of July it was five more  --  two lumpectomies , a pulmonary node , and two unknowns  --  and Pop was growing weary . No , far more than weary : sick to death of dealing with problems ranging from sick to death . <p> " I 'm sorry about the kids , " he apologized to Marianne on the Tuesday after the 4th , as they sat in the cluttered little kitchen in the doublewide . Marianne had just hung up from talking with the daughter in Visalia they had been scheduled to visit . " I just could n't get away , " said Pop . " Do n't know what I 'd of said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eatin ' on him cut out . " <p> " But you 're supposed to be retired , " said Marianne . " You 've been out on that damn lake every Saturday since I do n't know when . " <p> " Yeah , Mare , I know . But what am I gon na do ? Who 'm I gon na say no to ? And what the hell , it 's only one afternoon a week for me but it 's like the whole rest of their lives for some of these people . " <p> " Well , ca n't you get Arnie or Pete or one the other men to take ' em out in the boat ? " <p> " Tried it . Twice . Tried it different times , too . If I 'm not there and it 's any time but around 5:30 on a Saturday afternoon , nothin ' happens . " <p> " Story of our life , " sighed Marianne . " Ever since just after Marcy was born , when you got that pusher 's job up at Caribou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're there , everything supposed to happen , happens . " <p> " So what 'll I do , babe ? How do I get free from this monkey around my neck ? " Pop 's voice held more puzzlement than self-pity . <p> Marianne reached across the white enameled-steel kitchen table and took one of Pop 's strong hands in hers . She felt as much as saw its tiny tremor . " Eddie honey , I do n't know . It 's maybe only one afternoon a week now , but pretty soon when word gets around , then it 's going to be all day every day sorting people out , deciding who goes and who does n't go and figuring out what to say to the ones who do n't . " <p> She sighed and swept her eyes around the snug little room , the contents moved from house to house , always the heart of their forty-eight years together . She said , " I say you 're retired and the company and the social security , they 've said you 've done your share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just walk away from it . " <p> Pop nodded . " Yeah , you 're right . But you know , nothing lasts forever . Those guys up there in that thing , they 're gon na have something better to do , get all the  --  uh  --  harvest they need . Someday I 'm going to go out there and nobody 's gon na be home , and then I can quit . " <p> " Someday , sure . But Eddie , you just might not last all the way to someday . " <p> He nodded , feeling his age . " Uh-huh . In the meantime , what am I gon na do first Saturday I do n't go and somebody 's floppin ' around over at Community Memorial Hospital I could of , you know , saved . How the hell do you retire from that ? " <p> By the morning after Labor Day , the membership of the Retired Men 's Social Club &; Ladies ' Auxiliary was the healthiest collection of senior citizens outside the fabled tribes of Kazakhstani goatherds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no deductibles either . Pop , whose tremor had increased markedly as his weight had dropped  --  enough to genuinely frighten Marianne  --  sat that Tuesday morning at a card table wedged in among eases of bottled beer and potato chips , as he always did now , Mondays through Fridays , from eight to five , and sometimes into the evening . His days were consumed working with Arnie and whatever volunteers he could dragoon from the membership to sort through the piles of applications , medical reports , and pitiful pleas that were delivered in ever-bigger postal bags to the back room of the club . And then there was a long envelope from County Health and a fat packet with a federal frank from the Department of Health and Human Services addressed to " Provider . " He was afraid to open either . <p> Arnie , whose new lease on life with a healthy prostate had led him to some serious dieting and exercise and who now felt a vigor that was causing interesting problems at home , worried about his friend . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse . " <p> " I know . In the classifieds last night , in the Courier ? Somebody had one of those prayers to St. Jude , mentioned me by name . " <p> " Figure you got some direct connection to God I bet . " <p> " Hell , I 'm not even Catholic . " <p> " Well , lot of people around here figure you 're wired into something up there . " Arnie paused , deeply embarrassed by the direction of the conversation but unable to change it . " Hey , Pop , he said hesitantly , You believe in some of that stuff ? I mean , is there something goin ' on in that department I do n't know about ? " <p> Pop dropped the National Institutes of Health Taxonomy of Title 4 Surgical Procedures someone had sent to bolster his case for a ride in the bass boat . He shook his head . " No , Arnie . I 'm just as bummed by all this as you are . I mean , I do n't know if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that thing . You know ; you been up there . I mean , if there is some God somewhere who 's , like , quarterbackin ' this whole deal , I sure do n't know anything about it . I figure if there 's a God or if there is n't a God , who 'm I to know ? Like the chicken and the egg thing . Which one come first ? If the egg come first , who laid it ? If the chicken come first , who made the egg it hatched from ? And either way you got to imagine God , if you can imagine God , if there is a God , can you imagine God sittin ' on some egg to hatch it ? " <p> He picked up another document headed HHS Schedule 5 and rattled it . He was tired and a little angry . " I got better things to worry about , " he said . " If people think I 'm wired to God or St. Jude or for Christ 's sake AT &T; or Sprint or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . " <p> Arnie 's new vigor had sharpened some brain cells , too . He had a sudden insight . " Ah shit , Pop ! " he said , a grin splitting his round old face . " That 's it , ol ' buddy . You are wired . That 's why the bass boat deal only works when you 're there . " <p> Excited , Arnie rose to pace between cases , snapping his fingers . " Figures they 're not just settin ' up there twiddlin ' their thumbs all week waitin ' for Saturday . They got ta have some way of knowin ' when you show up with something they can  --  uh  --  harvest . They musta , them guys up there in that thing , they musta put something in when they took that thing outta you , back there , back in March . Something like that gizmo they stick into bears and deers so 's they can track ' em , or that thing , in cop stories on TV , you know , that thing they stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's they can follow him around . " <p> The logic was compelling . The truth overwhelming . Neither man doubted that Pop must have something stuck up under his tailpipe . <p> Because they had been wise enough to eschew formal leadership , let those who wanted to run things do so unless and until they angered too many members , the Retired Men 's Social Club &; Ladies ' Auxiliary seldom held anything that could be called a meeting , or took a vote , or formed factions , cliques , alliances , cabals , or blocs . Hence they generally drank and smoked together in unfashionable peace and complained about whose turn it was to do what and with which but without real animosity , although like all volunteers they took their pay in hitching rights . <p> The first Saturday evening after labor Day was as close as they had come to a formal meeting since the decision to buy the Wurlitzer two years before . Pop was absent , presumably resting up as usual after an arduous afternoon on the lake . But alter Arnie had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him somewhere that ought to be removed , the rest of the club spent a noisy but generally good-natured three hours in a series of debates . <p> To their credit , although they all realized it might be the end of the best health plan in America , the burden of discussion was not whether but how . A D-Day veteran proposed an Entebbe-style raid during which the duty ER surgeon at Community Memorial could be forced at gunpoint to look for and remove the whatever . <p> " Yeah , " said Chuck Binder , who 'd been a sheriff 's deputy for thirty-five years , " that 's about fifteen felonies , and what planet do we all go to live on when we 're done ? " <p> Some of the lady auxiliaries who 'd served on school or union committees or negotiated deals to exact a little civility from their teenage children suggested a meet-and-confer session with County Health . " Lay out the situation in detail , " said Marge Fromm . " Get the support of the medical professionals . " <p> Mary Orton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done at least as much good doctoring as the Mayo brothers , snorted . Said nothing in the ensuing silence , just snorted again , and Marge 's suggestion died . <p> The debate rumbled to a halt at a little after ten when Pop , still unrested from his day in the bass boat , appeared with Marianne and the black doc , a skinny guy with a grizzled beard who was thirty years younger than anyone else in the place . Pop was a little shaky , but with Marianne 's help , he stood by the bar , carefully avoiding leaning against it , and held up his hand . " Lot of you know Doctor Waitson from over at the Elderclinic . . . . " <p> " For you that do n't know me , " said Waitson , grinning " I 'm the one they call the black doc . I 'll let you guess why . Anyway , last couple of months I 've seen enough clear X-rays I did n't understand that now I 'm ready to go along with what Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm with you for a while on this thing . " <p> " What we got ta do , " said Pop , " is we got ta kind of reorganize things around here on account I 'm not getting any younger . " <p> Cries of " Come on , you 're still a kid ! " and " I got underwear older'n you ! " <p> Pop held up a hand . " What we got ta do is have what they used to call in P-G ' n E a division of labor . Doc Waitson here , he 'll take on what he calls the triage , sortin ' out the people who need what they can get from one of our boat trips from those that do n't . " <p> Cheers and whistles from the volunteers Pop had coerced into back room paperwork . <p> Waitson said , " Whoever I send you for a boat trip 's got nothing to do with medicine . You understand what I 'm saying ? I got a license to worry about . And the folks come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be much like you . They 'll be from around here , in the county all right , but some will be poor and some will be rich and some will talk with funny accents and the odds are more will be some different color than wo n't be . " <p> No cheers . Thoughtful silence . Throats clearing . Chairs squeaking . The black doc thought , this 'll maybe kill it , this is a whole other thing . This is too big a change . <p> On the Wurlitzer Randy Travis said we ai n't out of love yet . <p> " And the other thing is this here gizmo . . . " Pop pulled from his shin pocket a baggie with a plump golden needle gleaming in it . " . . . which Doc pulled outta my , well , outta me about an hour ago . " <p> Somebody unplugged the Wurlitzer . The room was as still as a buggy whip auction . Pop looked around , a little worried . One way or another , they had to stick together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' in , " he said . " It did n't hurt comin ' out . I did n't even know it was in there . And for as long as those funny-lookin ' geeks come around , as long as it 's harvest time over on Lake Oroville , someone 's got ta have this thing slipped into him . . . " <p> Marianne poked him , gently . <p> " . . . or her so 's we can go on doin ' the good things we been doin ' . Only thing is , you got ta be able to run a bass boat or be willin ' to learn how to run a bass boat , and you got ta be available out at the lake around five o'clock every Saturday afternoon , rain or shine . It 'll be like takin ' the duty for clean-up here , only maybe a little more uncomfortable and for longer , maybe a month at a time . <p> " So okay . Any volunteers ? " He rattled the baggie , its clatter noisy in the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed and so had the benefits . Slowly , quietly , glancing at one another and then away , one after another , every member of the Retired Men 's Social Club &; Ladies ' Auxiliary stood up and pushed their chairs back under the tables , ready to step off into the Oroville night . And then , hesitantly , every hand but one went up . <p> Hands in his pockets , Arnie said , " How many Saturday morning clean-ups do we get off for one tour in the bass boat ?
