She met him in a laundromat in London . He was open and friendly and they hit it off right away . From the start she thought he was hilarious . Of course , she 'd been lonely . The weather was grim and sleety and she did n't know a soul east of the Atlantic . " Ah , traveler 's loneliness , " Dan crooned sympathetically over dinner . " It 's the worst . " After dessert he was embarrassed to discover he 'd come without his wallet . She was more than happy to pay for dinner . At the pub , over drinks , he told her he was a translator for the United Nations . He was , for now , between assignments . They saw each other four times that week , five the week after . It was n't long before he had all but moved in with Elsa . It was against her nature , but she was having the time of her life . Still , there were details , unexplained , undiscussed , that she shoved out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home ; she never met his friends . One night he brought over a carton filled with tape recorders  --  plastic-wrapped straight from the factory , unopened ; a few days later they were gone . Once she came home to find three televisions stacked in the corner . " Storing them for a friend , " was all he told her . When she pressed for more he merely shrugged . Once he stayed away for three days and was lying asleep on the bed when she came in midmorning . " Where have you been ? " she cried . " I 've been so worried . Where were you ? " He looked sour as he woke up . " Do n't ever ask me that , " he snapped . " I wo n't have it . " " What  --  ? " " Where I go , what I do , who I do it with  --  it does n't concern you , Elsa . Do n't ask . " He was like a different person . But then he seemed to pull himself together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I know it hurts you , " he said in his old gentle way , " but think of jealousy as a flu , and wait to get over it . And you will , baby , you will . " Like a mother cat licking her kitten , he groomed her back into trusting him . One night she asked him lightly if he felt like stepping out to the corner and bringing her an ice cream . He did n't reply , and when she glanced up she found him glaring at her furiously . " Always got everything you wanted , did n't you ? " he asked in a strange , snide way . " Any little thing little Elsa wanted , somebody always jumped up and ran out and bought it far her , did n't they ? " " Are you kidding ? I 'm not like that . What are you talking about ? " He got up from the chair and walked out . She never saw him again . There is a class of individuals who have been around forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , and walk of life . Everybody has met these people , been deceived and manipulated by them , and forced to live with or repair the damage they have wrought . These often charming  --  but always deadly  --  individuals have a clinical name : psychopaths . Their hallmark is a stunning lack of conscience ; their game is self-gratification at the other person 's expense . Many spend time in prison , but many do not . All take far more than they give . The most obvious expressions of psychopathy  --  but not the only ones  --  involve the flagrant violation of society 's rules . Not surprisingly , many psychopaths are criminals , but many others manage to remain out of prison , using their charm and chameleonlike coloration to cut a wide swathe through society and leaving a wake of ruined lives behind them . A major part of my own quarter-century search for answers to this enigma has been a concerted effort to develop an accurate means of detecting the psychopaths among us . Measurement and categorization are of course fundamental to any scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychopaths are as much practical as academic . To put it simply , if we ca n't spot them we are doomed to be their victims , both as individuals and as a society . My role in the search for psychopaths began in the 1960s at the psychology department of the University of British Columbia . There , my growing interest in psychopathy merged with my experience working with psychopaths in prison to form what was my life work . I assembled a team of clinicians who would identify psychopaths in the prison population by means of long , detailed interviews and close study of file information . From this eventually developed a highly reliable diagnostic tool that any clinician or researcher could use and that yielded a richly detailed profile of the personality disorder called psychopathy . We named this instrument the Psychopathy Check list ( Multi-Health Systems ; 1991 ) . The checklist is now used world-wide and provides clinicians and researchers with a way of distinguishing with reasonable certainty true psychopaths from those who merely break the rules . What follows is a general summary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use these symptoms to diagnose yourself or others . A diagnosis requires explicit training and access to the formal scoring manual . If you suspect that someone you know conforms to the profile described here , and if it is important for you to have an expert opinion , you should obtain the services of a qualified ( registered ) forensic psychologist or psychiatrist . Also , be aware that people who are not psychopaths may have some of the symptoms described here . Many people are impulsive , or glib , or cold and unfeeling , but this does not mean that they are psychopaths . Psychopathy is a syndrome  --  a cluster of related symptoms . KEY SYMPTOMS OF PSYCHOPATHY EMOTIONAL/INTERPERSONAL : * Glib and superficial * Egocentric and grandiose * Lack of remorse or guilt * Lack of empathy * Deceitful and manipulative * Shallow emotions SOCIAL DEVIANCE : * Impulsive * Poor behavior controls * Need for excitement * Lack of responsibility * Early behavior problems * Adult antisocial behavior GLIB AND SUPERFICIAL Psychopaths are often voluble and verbally facile . They can be amusing and entertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to tell unlikely but convincing stories that cast themselves in a good light . They can be very effective in presenting themselves well and are often very likable and charming . One of my raters described an interview she did with a prisoner : " I sat down and took out my clipboard , " she said , " and the first thing this guy told me was what beautiful eyes I had . He managed to work quite a few compliments on my appearance into the interview , so by the time I wrapped things up , I was feeling unusually ... well , pretty . I 'm a wary person especially on the job , and can usually spot a phony . When I got back outside , I could n't believe I 'd fallen for a line like that . " EGOCENTRIC AND GRANDIOSE Psychopaths have a narcissistic and grossly inflated view of their own self-worth and importance , a truly astounding egocentricity and sense of entitlement , and see themselves as the center of the universe , justified in living according to their own rules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , " said one subject . " I follow my own laws . I never violate my own rules . " She then proceeded to describe these rules in terms of " looking out for number one . " Psychopaths often claim to have specific goals but show little appreciation regarding the qualifications required  --  they have no idea of how to achieve them and little or no chance of attaining these goals , given their track record and lack of sustained interest in formal education . The psychopathic inmate might outline vague plans to become a lawyer for the poor or a property tycoon . One inmate , not particularly literate , managed to copyright the title of a book he was planning to write about himself , already counting the fortune his best-selling book would bring . LACK OF REMORSE OR GUILT Psychopaths show a stunning lack of concern for the effects their actions have on others , no matter how devastating these might be . They may appear completely forthright about the matter , calmly stating that they have no sense of guilt , are not sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason now to be concerned . When asked if he had any regrets about stabbing a robbery victim who subsequently spent time in the hospital as a result of his wounds , one of our subjects replied , " Get real ! He spends a few months in hospital and I rot here . If I wanted to kill him I would have slit his throat . That 's the kind of guy I am ; I gave him a break . " Their lack of remorse or guilt is associated with a remarkable ability to rationalize their behavior , to shrug off personal responsibility for actions that cause family , friends , and others to reel with shock and disappointment . They usually have handy excuses for their behavior , and in some cases deny that it happened at all . LACK OF EMPATHY Many of the characteristics displayed by psychopaths are closely associated with a profound lack of empathy and inability to construct a mental and emotional " facsimile " of another person . They seem completely unable to " get into the skin " of others , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rights and suffering of family and strangers alike . If they do maintain ties , it is only because they see family members as possessions . One of our subjects allowed her boyfriend to sexually molest her five-year-old daughter because " he wore me out . I was n't ready for more sex that night . " The woman found it hard to understand why the authorities took her child into care . DECEITFUL AND MANIPULATIVE With their powers of imagination in gear and beamed on themselves , psychopaths appear amazingly unfazed by the possibility  --  or even by the certainty  --  of being found out . When caught in a lie or challenged with the is truth , they seldom appear perplexed or embarrassed  --  they simply change their stories or attempt to rework the facts so they appear to be consistent with the lie . The result is a series of contradictory statements and a thoroughly confused listener . And psychopaths seem proud of their ability to lie . When asked if she lied easily , one woman laughed and replied , " I 'm the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something bad about myself . They think , well , if she 's admitting to that she must be telling the truth about the rest . " SHALLOW EMOTIONS Psychopaths seem to suffer a kind of emotional poverty that limits the range and depth of their feelings . At times they appear to be cold and unemotional while nevertheless being prone to dramatic , shallow , and short-lived displays of feeling . Careful observers are left with the impression they are play-acting and little is going on below the surface . A psychopath in our research said that he did n't really understand what others meant by fear . " When I rob a bank , " he said , " I notice that the teller shakes . One barfed all over the money . She must have been pretty messed up inside , but I do n't know why . If someone pointed a gun at me I guess I 'd be afraid , but I would n't throw up . " When asked if he ever felt his heart pound or his stomach churn , he replied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really get pumped up when I have sex or when I get into a fight . " IMPULSIVE Psychopaths are unlikely to spend much time weighing the pros and cons of a course of action or considering the possible consequences . " I did it because I felt like it , " is a common response . These impulsive acts often result from an aim that plays a central role in most of the psychopath 's behavior : to achieve immediate satisfaction , pleasure , or relief . So family members , relatives , employers , and coworkers typically find themselves standing around asking themselves what happened  --  jobs are quit , relationships broken off , plans changed , houses ransacked , people hurt , often for what appears as little more than a whim . As the husband of a psychopath I studied put it : " She got up and left the table , and that was the last I saw of her for two months . " POOR BEHAVIOR CONTROLS Besides being impulsive , psychopaths are highly reactive to perceived insults or slights . Most of us have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to respond aggressively we are usually able to " keep the lid on . " In psychopaths , these inhibitory controls are weak , and the slightest provocation is sufficient to overcome them . As a result , psychopaths are short-tempered or hotheaded and tend to respond to frustration , failure , discipline , and criticism with sudden violence , threats or verbal abuse . But their outbursts , extreme as they may be , are often short-lived , and they quickly act as if nothing out of the ordinary has happened . For example , an inmate in line for dinner was accidentally bumped by another inmate , whom he proceeded to beat senseless . The attacker then stepped back into line as if nothing had happened . Despite the fact that he faced solitary confinement as punishment for the infraction , his only comment when asked to explain himself was , " I was pissed off . He stepped into my space . I did what I had to do . " Although psychopaths have a " hair trigger , " their aggressive displays are " cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals lose their temper . A NEED FOR EXCITEMENT Psychopaths have an ongoing and excessive need for excitement  --  they long to live in the fast lane or " on the edge , " where the action is . In many cases the action involves the breaking of rules . Many psychopaths describe " doing crime " for excitement or thrills . When asked if she ever did dangerous things just for fun , one of our female psychopaths replied , " Yeah , lots of things . But what I find most exciting is walking though airports with drugs . Christ ! What a high ! " The flip side of this yen for excitement is an inability to tolerate routine or monotony . Psychopaths are easily bored and are not likely to engage in activities that are dull , repetitive , or require intense concentration over long periods . LACK OF RESPONSIBILITY Obligations and commitments mean nothing to psychopaths . Their good intentions  --  " I 'll never cheat on you again "  --  are promises written on the wind . Horrendous credit histories , for example , reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty pledge to contribute to a child 's support . Their performance on the job is erratic , with frequent absences , misuse of company resources , violations of company policy , and general untrustworthiness . They do not honor formal or implied commitments to people , organizations , or principles . Psychopaths are not deterred by the possibility that their actions mean hardship or risk for others . A 25-year-old inmate in our studies has received more than 20 convictions for dangerous driving , driving while impaired , leaving the scene of an accident , driving without a license , and criminal negligence causing death . When asked if he would continue to drive after his release from prison , he replied , " Why not ? Sure , I drive fast , but I 'm good at it . It takes two to have an accident . " EARLY BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS Most psychopaths begin to exhibit serious behavioral problems at an early age . These might include persistent lying , cheating , theft , arson , truancy , substance abuse , vandalism , and/or precocious sexuality . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or another  --  especially children raised in violent neighborhoods or in disrupted or abusive families  --  it is important to emphasize that the psychopath 's history of such behaviors is more extensive and serious than most , even when compared with that of siblings and friends raised in similar settings . One subject , serving time for fraud , told us that as a child he would put a noose around the neck of a cat , tie the other end of the string to the top of a pole , and bat the cat around the pole with a tennis racket . Although not all adult psychopaths exhibited this degree of cruelty when in their youth , virtually all routinely got themselves into a wide range of difficulties . ADULT ANTISOCIAL BEHAVIOR Psychopaths see the rules and expectations of society as inconvenient and unreasonable impediments to their own behavioral expression . They make their own rules , both as children and as adults . Many of the antisocial acts of psychopaths lead to criminal charges and convictions . Even within the criminal population , psychopaths stand out , largely because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and frequent than are those of other criminals . Psychopaths tend to have no particular affinity , or " specialty , " for one particular type of crime but tend to try everything . But not all psychopaths end up in jail . Many of the things they do escape detection or prosecution , or are on " the shady side of the law . " For them , antisocial behavior may consist of phony stock promotions , questionable business practices , spouse or child abuse , and so forth . Many others do things that , though not necessarily illegal , are nevertheless unethical , immoral , or harmful to others : philandering or cheating on a spouse to name a few . ORIGINS Thinking about psychopathy leads us very quickly to a single fundamental question : Why are some people like this ? Unfortunately , the forces that produce a psychopath are still obscure , an admission those looking for clear answers will find unsatisfying . Nevertheless , there are several rudimentary theories about the cause of psychopathy worth considering . At one end of the spectrum are theories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biological factors ( nature ) , whereas theories at the other end posit that psychopathy results entirely from a faulty early social environment ( nurture ) . The position that I favor is that psychopathy emerges from a complex  --  and poorly understood  --  interplay between biological factors and social forces . It is based on evidence that genetic factors contribute to the biological bases of brain function and to basic personality structure , which in turn influence the way an individual responds to , and interacts with , life experiences and the social environment . In effect , the core elements needed for the development of psychopathy  --  including a profound inability to experience empathy and the complete range of emotions , including fear  --  are in part provided by nature and possibly by some unknown biological influences on the developing fetus and neonate . As a result , the capacity for developing internal controls and conscience and for making emotional " connections " with others is greatly reduced . CAN ANYTHING BE DONE ? In their desperate search for solutions people trapped in a destructive and seemingly hopeless relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and send him for therapy . A basic assumption of psychotherapy is that the patient needs and wants help for distressing or painful psychological and emotional problems . Successful therapy also requires that the patient actively participate , along with the therapist , in the search for relief of his or her symptoms . In short , the patient must recognize there is a problem and must want to do something about it . But here is the crux : Psychopaths do n't feel they have psychological or emotional problems , and they see no reason to change their behavior to conform with societal standards they do not agree with . Thus , in spite of more than a century of clinical study and decades of research , the mystery of the psychopathy still remains . Recent developments have provided us with new insights into the nature of this disturbing disorder , and its borders are becoming more defined . But compared with other major clinical disorders , little research has been devoted to psychopathy , even though it is responsible for more social distress and disruption than all other psychiatric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the pieces after the damage has been done , it would make far greater sense to increase our efforts to understand this perplexing disorder and to search for effective early interventions . The alternatives are to continue devoting massive resources to the prosecution , incarceration , and supervision of psychopaths after they have committed offenses against society , and to continue to ignore the welfare and plight of their victims . We have to learn how to socialize them , not resocialize them . And this will require serious efforts at research and early intervention . It is imperative that we continue the search for clues . A SURVIVAL GUIDE Although no one is completely immune to the devious machinations of the psychopath , there are some things you can do to reduce your vulnerability . * Know what you are dealing with . This sounds easy but in fact can be very difficult . All the reading in the world can not immunize you from the devastating effects of psychopaths . Everyone , including the experts , can be taken in , conned , and left bewildered by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heart strings . * Try not to be influenced by " props . " It is not easy to get beyond the winning smile , the captivating body language , the fast talk of the typical psychopath , all of which blind us to his or her real intentions . Many people find it difficult to deal with the intense , " predatory stare " of the psychopath . The fixated stare is more a prelude to self-gratification and the exercise of power rather than simple interest or empathic caring . * Do n't wear blinders . Enter new relationships with your eyes wide open . Like the rest of us , most psychopathic con-artists and " love-thieves " initially hide their dark side by putting their " best foot forward . " Cracks may soon begin to appear in the mask they wear , but once trapped in their web , it will be difficult to escape financially and emotionally unscathed . * Keep your guard up in high-risk situations . Some situations are tailor-made for psychopaths : singles bars , ship cruises , foreign airports , etc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking for a good time , excitement , or companionship , and there will usually be someone willing to oblige , for a hidden price . * Know yourself . Psychopaths are skilled at detecting and ruthlessly exploiting your weak spots . Your best defense is to understand what these spots are , and to be extremely wary of anyone who zeroes in on them . Unfortunately , even the most careful precautions are no guarantee that you will be safe from a determined psychopath . In such cases , all you can do is try to exert some sort of damage control . This is not easy but some suggestions may be of help : * Obtain professional advice . Make sure the clinician you consult is familiar with the literature on psychopathy and has had experience in dealing with psychopaths. * Do n't blame yourself . Whatever the reasons for being involved with a psychopath , it is important that you not accept blame for his or her attitudes and behavior . Psychopaths play by the same rules  --  their rules  --  with everyone . * Be aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is they who are suffering and that the victims are to blame for their misery . Do n't waste your sympathy on them . * Recognize that you are not alone . Most psychopaths have lots of victims . It is certain that a psychopath who is causing you grief is also causing grief to others . * Be careful about power struggles . Keep in mind that psychopaths have a strong need for psychological and physical control over others . This does n't mean that you should n't stand up for your rights , but it will probably be difficult to do so without risking serious emotional or physical trauma . * Set firm ground rules . Although power struggles with a psychopath are risky , you may be able to set up some clear rules  --  both for yourself and for the psychopath  --  to make your life easier and begin the difficult transition from victim to a person looking out for yourself . * Do n't expect dramatic changes . To a large extent , the personality of psychopaths is " carved in stone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental , sustained changes in how they see themselves or others . * Cut your losses . Most victims of psychopaths end up feeling confused and hopeless , and convinced that they are largely to blame for the problem . The more you give in the more you will be taken advantage of by the psychopath 's insatiable appetite for power and control . * Use support groups . By the time your suspicions have led you to seek a diagnosis , you already know that you 're in for a very long and bumpy ride . Make sure you have all the emotional support you can muster . <p>
