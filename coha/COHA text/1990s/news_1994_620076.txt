<p> STRIKE TALK <p> Editor  --  If the baseball owners make so much money , why is there no waiting line when the Giants or A 's are for sale ? <p> Do you know any player who left baseball for another job because he could n't afford to play ? <p> BILL HORAN <p> Concord <p> . <p> Editor  --  So the baseball season ends in bickering and hard feelings , and everyone loses . All so useless because there was an obvious solution that would have achieved what the owners wanted , which was lower salaries , and which the players could not refuse . <p> Make all players free agents after two years , with absolutely no contracts of more than two years . <p> They say every player should have the opportunity to determine his value on the free market . So give them what they say they want . But what would happen ? The market would be flooded . Every position would have half the players on the market , including good players who are still cheap . With so many free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driving up salaries . The salaries would come down because the huge long-term salaries have been draining the market . <p> ALFRED C. HEXTER <p> Kensington <p> . <p> Editor  --  Baseball fans have been treated badly by the players and owners too long . Reduce salaries and ticket prices . A salary cap of $ 10 million per team , an average of $ 400,000 per player , sounds fair to me . <p> ROBERT BARDEN <p> El Cerrito <p> . <p> Editor  --  Baseball owners are living proof that you do n't have to be real smart to inherit a lot of money . Asking players to restrict their salaries to a percentage of revenue is tantamount to asking them to guarantee profits to the owners . What gall ! <p> TONY LIMA <p> San Carlos <p> . <p> Editor  --  A short reality check . My wife is a teacher . Her yearly income before taxes is just above $ 18,000 . I work with handicapped children and adults . I pull in almost $ 12,000 a year , before taxes . We both love baseball . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city wants to build the Giants a new one . I think we 'll go on strike . <p> Baseball has withstood depressions , wars and the press only to be taken down by greed . Welcome to the ' 90s . <p> SCOTT C. SMITH <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> Editor  --  This is the best of times ! No boring baseball , no monotonous basketball , only football . <p> Baseball is as exciting as watching grass grow . Hope the strike goes on forever . <p> FRED MORATH <p> Millbrae <p> . <p> Editor  --  While I can agree with Bruce Jenkins ( September 15 ) on many points , his comparisons of ball players ' labor problems with problems of working people in the real world is ridiculous . Apples and oranges , Bruce . So what if the average career of a ball player is only 4.8 years . Is he completely useless after that ? Ca n't he go and get a real job , like the rest of us slobs who pay his salary ? <p> And Bruce , a yearly salary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , many players make more than 75 percent of what the working populace make in their lifetimes . <p> Most fans , myself included , can accept the fact that a player should get as much as he can . But when the millions they get is still not enough , and these greedy groups , players and owners , can bring this great game to a halt , it is disgraceful . <p> BILL COOPER <p> Concord <p> . <p> Editor  --  Mr. Jenkins ' position that the owners and players killed the Game could n't be further from the truth . The Game does not realize its life from the displays of a professional league . The Game is what is played by millions of children and adults around the world . It is being part of a local softball league or a local little-league organization , playing with , encouraging and cheering your friends and children as they put forth their effort . The Game is played for sake of ' playing the game , ' to win or lose , to hit the game-winner or catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paid players and owners of exhibition baseball with the Game . The Game will continue , with or without them . <p> JIM McCLELLAND <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> QB TALK <p> Editor  --  The column of Mr. Glenn Dickey , The Best Quarterback ? Steve Young ( September 9 ) , is enlightening . He will not stop at anything which will put Steve Young short of being better than Joe Montana . He always supports his analyses on the basis of statistics . <p> All these statistics are true . In fact , Young is always MVP because of them . But in spite of having been MVP , he still has not delivered even a conference trophy . Is he capable of delivering or not ? Only time will tell . <p> EMMANUEL S. CRISOSTOMO <p> Daly City <p> . <p> Editor  --  Everyone knew a Glenn Dickey in high school . Short , funny-looking , unathletic and unpopular , he got his revenge by getting a job on the school paper and writing columns designed to irritate those who had scorned and ridiculed him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its readers have been tortured for years by columns designed to irritate them by putting down Joe Montana . Many of these columns have been mean-spirited and nasty . This of course has not served to diminish Joe Montana , as was intended , but have only to make Dickey look more desperate and pathetic . But enough is enough . You have plenty of capable sportswriters . Let Monday 's ridiculous column be the last of Mr. Dickey . <p> BILL BLAKEMAN <p> Palo Alto <p> . Editor  --  I have more respect than ever for Steve Young . He was forced to stand in behind a makeshift offensive line and he still continued driving his team forward to what would have been the tying touchdown in the fourth quarter . Young did not complain about the offensive line or the tough hits he took . He continues to be a class act ( unlike another quarterback so reverently worshipped ) and if the 49ers and the Chiefs happen to meet again in January , my money is on Steve . Good Karma follows good people , or does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> . <p> Editor  --  Is n't it time we started facing certain realities ? <p> No matter how many so-called " passing titles " Steve Young collects , he remains perhaps the worst clutch quarterback in the NFL . Would n't it be nice if Young could exhibit the same brilliance in the fourth quarter of a close game as he displays in 44-10 wins over Tampa Bay ? <p> The time is now to recognize the shame : Steve Young is not a winner , nor is he the best . He is the left-handed Marc Wilson <p> ANDREW FEDELL &; <p> TONY MAKWICK <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> Editor  --  As Great as Joe is , he never could have survived the beating that Steve took . When the 49er offensive line again comes together later this season , I say bring on the AFC champs on Super Bowl Sunday and the 49ers front five will be glad to give them a ride to football school . <p> JOHN JACOBSEN <p> Fremont <p> . <p> Editor  --  Steve who ? <p> EDDIE MARTIN <p> San Carlos <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but notice how your writers were raving on about Joe Montana 's performance in today 's paper with nary a quibble about his quiet personality . There was not one word about how boring that was . This is in stark contrast to the numerous comments about Pete Sampras ' alleged lackluster personality which seems to be more important than how skilled he is at his sport . Why such different treatment ? <p> LESLEY ALLEN <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> NO FOR DEION <p> Editor  --  The acquisition of Deion Sanders makes me sick and it goes against the 49ers ' image of class and team play . This hot shot has n't proven to anyone he 's as great as he thinks he is . Besides he tackles like a sissy . <p> It makes the management look so desperate and low that I have lost just about all respect for the organization . I enjoyed it while it lasted , but now it is gone . <p> MATT ROBERTS <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> Editor  --  Deion Sanders a 49er ? DeBartolo and Policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved team of heroes ? This is an ugly sellout . You 're going to need a double-size helmet and a separate playing field to house this egomaniac . He is n't worthy to carry Jerry Rice 's jockstrap . <p> Sanders is a world-class talent wasted on a small-town mentality . Will our Niners now " vogue " down the sidelines ? Will they work the press like P.T. Barnum ? Suddenly nothing is sacred ? <p> Why stop here ? Bring back Charles Haley ! Hire Jimmy Johnson ! How about Tim McKyer  --  you 'll need a stooge to flip Deion the ball before he prances into the end zone , his jewelry sparkling in the light of the thousand flashbulbs . <p> STEVE &; KIT SCHLICH <p> Petaluma <p> . <p> Address all correspondence to Letters to the Green , Sports Department , San Francisco Chronicle , 901 Mission Street , San Francisco , Calif. 94119 .
