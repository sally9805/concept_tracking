WITH A LITTLE prompting I could expound at length on the deep emotional resonances of sports . I could speak , for example , of how , through long and intimate familiarity , I feel implicated in the fate of the Boston Red Sox . I could describe how from grade school to graduate school , from northern Vermont to southern Connecticut , the sounds of Red Sox broadcasts wafted out of car radios and summer cottages : the fortunes of the Sox hovered in the background of life like a long-term romance , varied in intensity , suffused in expectancy . I could mention cruelly sharp memories of a fall afternoon in 1978 when Carl Yastrzemski came to the plate with two outs and the tying runs on base in the bottom of the ninth in the one-game playoff against the Yankees . Overmatched against Goose Gossage , the aging Yaz lofted a weak foul to Nettles at third , and the tavern in New Haven erupted with hated Yankee fans , and my friends and I walked home in ignominy , burdened by the knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get another chance . I could go on in increasingly lyrical terms , but I 've become wary of such impulses after watching Ken Burns 's TV documentary Baseball on PBS . The narrator 's sonorous celebrations of the game , and the rapturous philosophizing and reminiscing engaged in by the various writers , editors and celebrities that Burns interviewed , quickly got cloying . Less talk , more replays , urged the baseball fans in my house . Was Burns so cynical as to think our attachment to the game required the imprimatur of people like George Will , Doris Kearns Goodwin and Billy Crystal ? It 's not that baseball is n't profound or worth celebrating but that , as with food and sex , talking about it is not always the best way to register one 's appreciation . Two currently popular ways of reflecting on sports strike me as especially decadent . The first is seeing a game as an enactment of mythic , quasi-religious themes ( like " going home " ) . This often takes the form of unearthing buried metaphors and then getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late A. Bartlett Giamatti , the literary scholar turned university president turned baseball commissioner : " In baseball , the journey begins at home , negotiates the twists and turns at first , and often founders far out at the edges of the ordered world at rocky second  --  the farthest point from home ... and when it is given one to round third , a long journey seemingly over , the end in sight , then the hunger for home , the drive to rejoin one 's earlier self and one 's fellows is a pressing , growing screaming in the blood " ( Take Time for Paradise ) . Reading this , one is most aware of - all the ways that baseball does not resemble real journeys with real hazards . Giamatti is merely indulging in a clever but misleading conceit  --  what we might call , borrowing a term from the biblical scholars , the " anagogic " or spiritual interpretation of baseball . Those who appreciate the " plain sense " rightly regard such interpretations the way they view analogical readings of scripture : as hermeneutically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the tendency to focus not on the details and mechanics of the game but on its emotional byproducts  --  such as how 1 you felt watching Carlton Fisk 's home run in the ' ' 75 World Series , or how through your son 's love of baseball you feel connected to your father . In The Screwtape Letters : Screwtape advises Wormwood to get people thinking about how they feel when they pray , since it will take their minds off God . The devil is similarly at work urging sports fans to celebrate their feelings rather than the reality which gives rise to them . Hearing people emote about baseball is like hearing people describe how they feel after taking communion : it seems dangerously beside the point . It 's not only the baseball literati who exult in feelings these days . Every player interviewed on a postgame show is bound to be asked , " How did it feel when you hit the home run , muffed the ground ball , recovered the fumble ? " This question may reflect mass media 's reliance on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case , the question is stupefyingly obtuse and , far from being the " sensitive " question it seems , displays a maddening insensitivity to the player and the game . Any fan who 's been paying attention already knows perfectly well how the player feels : the range of feeling is embedded in the drama of the game and crystallized in the development of each situation . How much more respectful of the deeper mysteries of the game are those broadcasters who ask , " So what did he throw ya  --  the slider ? " In various ways we try to make sports useful . We want them to provide lessons for life , metaphors of some larger reality , stimulants for the emotions . Sports encompass all those things , but the danger in concentrating on them is that we trespass on the true mystery and the source of fascination : sports are fundamentally useless . They have no larger point or meaning . There is no point to hitting a baseball , or to tossing a basketball through a hoop  --  no point beyond the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work is not accomplished , mouths are not fed , the world is not improved , but we want to do these things anyway . Inutility is the key to whatever religious meaning sports have . Peter Berger , in his book A Rumor of Angels , in the course of arguing that theology must begin not with revelation or an authoritative tradition but with ordinary human experience , describes certain " signals of transcendence " that surface in everyday life and that point to a " transcendent " reality . Among these " rumors of angels " is the human capacity for playing games . The world of play , Berger says , " sets up a separate universe of discourse , with its own rules , which suspends " for the duration " the rules and general assumptions of the " serious " world . " Reflecting on some girls playing hopscotch , Berger notes how they are " completely intent on their game , closed to the world outside it , happy in their concentration . " Berger sees that what is incipiently religious about baseball and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and enchanted by an alternative universe , one that in terms of everyday life serves no purpose . This other world offers us not a distilled , play-acted version of our own world , but a different world , with its own rules and its own chronology . If we insist on doing so , we can , like Giamatti , translate the meanings of this other world into our own . Yet what is most exciting are the parts that remain untranslatable . We get a sense of the self-contained , otherworldly aspect of sport whenever the ball carrier runs out of bounds and the tacklers ease up , or whenever the third out is made and the runner sprinting for home breaks stride . The universe of the game is interrupted and the ordinary universe resumes its sway until the play starts again . William James once pointed out that the object of football is not simply to carry the ball into the other team 's end zone . If that were true , then players could sneak into the stadium the night before the game and bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the ball within an elaborate set of rules and time constraints . The point , in short , is to inhabit a different universe . These days my sons spend much of their time immersed in alternative worlds . Along with poring over box scores and raptly sorting the cards of their heroes , they tend to ruminate on the rules of the game and ponder the possible eventualities . " What if , " they will suddenly ask at dinner , " the runner fumbles the ball forward and the ball is caught in the air by someone on his own team  --  is it a fumble or an illegal forward pass ? " Such are the meditations of true believers , happy to explore the nooks and crannies of this other world simply because it exists . Despite strikes , rampant commercialization , enormous profits and relentless marketing , a kernel of sports remains otherworldly and incorruptibly irrelevant . When I emerge from absorption in some televised game , a bit numb from the broadcast jargon and disoriented by the incessant alternation between worlds  --  the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background murmurs of the " serious " world  --  it occurs to me to wonder if this was a useful way to spend my afternoon . I reassure myself : No , it was incorrigibly , magically , useless . <p>
