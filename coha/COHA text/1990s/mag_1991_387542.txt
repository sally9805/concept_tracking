Ignoring the Iraqi bomb <p> Now that President Bush is threatening to bomb Iraq for continuing to develop nuclear weapons , maybe it 's unseemly to point out how his own administration acquiesced in Iraq 's nuclear program in the first place . But secret government documents that were recently declassified show how extensive that acquiescence was . Several years ago lower- and mid-level U.S. intelligence and export control bureaucrats began tracing a sinister pattern of Iraqi nuclear acquisitions in the United States and Europe . Yet when they tried to alert members of the Bush Cabinet , they were blocked by queasy superiors . What 's more , officials who tried to raise the early alarm were punished for their temerity , and those who brushed off the warnings were rewarded . <p> The Department of Energy , where much of this drama played out , is the agency with principal responsibility for the design , manufacture , and control of U.S. nuclear weapons . It 's also supposed to play a role in defense and foreign policy , helping to keep tabs , among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To clear up a management mess and bolster morale , President Bush installed as energy secretary James Watkins , a former admiral with a reputation for sensitivity and common sense . But even under Watkins 's stewardship , the department 's top leadership at best appears to have displayed a lack of confidence in its handling of intelligence about Iraq 's nuclear program . At worst , there was dereliction of duty . <p> Some of the most reliable intelligence about a country 's nuclear intentions comes from what nuclear bomb parts it has on its shopping list . By the mid-1980s Iraq 's list was hardly a secret to the U.S. government . Commerce Department documents show that the Iraqis were openly soliciting American companies for nuclear equipment that could be put to military use . The government learned about some Iraqi solicitations directly : American nuclear suppliers applied to the Commerce Department for export licenses , and government computer printouts indicate that from at least 1985 on , Energy Department analysts considered some of these shipments suspect . That year , at the Energy Department 's recommendation , Commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American matriel to the Iraqi atomic agency . One rejected application , submitted by Teledyne Wah Chang , a metals manufacturer , involved zirconium rods , used in nuclear reactors . At least three other export applications involving a company called EG &G,; which makes parts for nuclear bomb triggers , were rejected on Energy Department advice between 1988 and 1990 . <p> Yet the effectiveness of even these limited moves to block obvious American exports to Iraq 's nuclear program is debatable . Intelligence officials today say many of Iraq 's most sensitive nuclear acquisitions were made through front companies either in the West or in Iraq . Several organizations now known to have been fronts for the Iraqi nuclear program figure prominently on the list of purchasers whose American export permits were approved . In many cases , according to its confidential files , the Commerce Department never bothered to run these applications past nuclear weapons experts at the Energy Department , though other less specialized analysts at the Pentagon and State Department were sometimes consulted . <p> Eventually , though , analysts in the Energy Department 's small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's determined effort to acquire nuclear weapon components from export license applications was bolstered by reports from intelligence agencies such as the NSA and the CIA , which were monitoring German shipments of uranium enrichment technology to Iraq , and law enforcement agencies such as Customs , whose officials were trying to arrest international arms smugglers . <p> Beginning in 1988 the Energy Department analysts noted that the Iraqis seemed to have launched a particularly intense effort to acquire the sophisticated devices necessary to detonate a nuclear bomb . In October 1988 , according to a still-confidential government chronology , a Dr. H. Kadim of the Ministry of Higher Education in Baghdad placed an order with a company called Maxwell Laboratories for what U.S. government analysts considered " weapons-grade " capacitors used in atom bomb detonation . The following April , Kadim contacted the British office of a California-based company called Reynolds Industries to ask for a price quotation on sixty high-tech " spark gaps , " another critical component of a nuclear bomb trigger . <p> By this time the Energy Department 's export specialists were seriously concerned that Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . " That is a quote from testimony given last April by A. Bryan Siebert , once the Energy Department 's top export control officer , at a closed hearing of a House oversight subcommittee headed by John Dingell , a longtime Energy Department nemesis . According to Siebert 's written testimony , he concluded the evidence was so alarming that Secretary Watkins should rapidly be briefed . Several draft briefing papers , declassified recently with major deletions , were drawn up by Siebert . Undated , but attached to supporting material dating from April and May 1989 , one paper noted that " manufacture of Iraqi nuclear weapons would further destabilize the Middle East and multiply the chances for a nuclear event .. Should Iraq successfully procure such items in the U.S. , it would embarrass the U.S. government , as well as injure U.S. non-proliferation objectives . " Other drafts , with similar conclusions , included the recommendation that Watkins " contact Secretary Baker to discuss a high level inter-governmental review , under National Security Council auspices to determine options and recommendations . " <p> In hindsight these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Siebert 's testimony , when he tried to send them to Watkins through Energy Department channels , he was blocked by the department 's top intelligence official , Robert J. Walsh . According to Siebert , " The intelligence office did not believe that the information they or we had justified escalating the matter within DOE . " A declassified but bowdlerized memorandum from the department 's intelligence chief states his rationale for blocking Siebert 's proposal in somewhat fragmentary terms : " While we strongly support the concern expressed in Mr. Siebert 's recommendation we would suggest that another approach be considered several sentences deleted .. It may well be worthwhile to apply DOE resources to concentrate on the Iraq issue and we are interested in supporting such a venture . However , we are uncomfortable with a secretarial level initiative , at this time .. " <p> But according to a briefing paper prepared by congressional investigators , the Energy officials who blocked Siebert never made special efforts to check out his analysis . Moreover , what little information about Iraqi nuclear activities the intelligence staff did feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The understated conclusion of Dingell 's staff was that " an opportunity for triggering DOE and U.S. government action was missed . " <p> The contretemps between alarmed export control and complacent intelligence officials of the Energy Department was quickly followed by a further blunder by both the Energy Department and the Pentagon . Over Labor Day weekend in 1989 , the three nuclear weapons labs bankrolled by the Energy Department ( Livermore , Los Alamos , and Sandia ) , along with several military labs , sponsored the ninth in a series of quadrennial international scientific conferences on explosives . Though all of the papers presented at the Portland , Oregon , conference were unclassified and many concerned information useful in industry or conventional weapons , some of the information exchanged clearly related to atomic weapons . In an internal memo last December , the head of the Energy Department 's bomb-making division , Assistant Secretary Richard Claytor , acknowledged that the Portland conference " was the place to be if you were a potential nuclear weapons proliferant . " <p> Among the hundreds of top weapons scientists attending the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now known to have been part of Saddam 's nuclear research network . While at the conference , one of the Iraqis stopped by a display booth set up by Reynolds Industries , which sells detonator parts to the Energy Department 's nuclear bomb program , and filled out a card asking to be put on the company 's mailing list . The Iraqi gave as his address " Al-Qaqaa State Estbt. sic , PO Box 5134 , Baghdad . " When I asked Milton Finger , a senior official at the Livermore Lab who attended the Portland conference , why Iraqis had been invited , he laughed nervously and noted that " Iraq was a friend at one point . " ( Although maintaining that its sponsorship of the 1989 seminar was entirely proper , the Energy Department recently disclosed that it was withdrawing its support for a tenth international detonation symposium scheduled for Boston in 1993 . ) <p> In April 1990 senior Bush administration officials were finally forced to take notice of the evidence their own bureaucrats had been accumulating about the Iraqi nuclear drive when a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wellpublicized arrests of a British-based network of Iraqis , who , at the direction of the Al-Qaqaa State Establishment in Baghdad , had been placing ever larger and more suspicious orders with American manufacturers for nuclear bomb trigger parts . Confidential government documents show that the Energy Department 's export control office had been monitoring the activities of this particular Iraqi network since at least 1988 and took this intelligence into account when launching its abortive effort to devise a tougher policy toward the Iraqis in 1989 . <p> Though the Bush administration touted the sting operation as a major crackdown on the Iraqis , officials with inside knowledge say the undercover operation was brought to fruition primarily as a result of pressure from then British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . After Farzad Bazoft , an Iranian-born journalist working for The London Observer , was arrested in Baghdad while investigating an explosion at a military base , Thatcher put out the word to American and British law enforcement agencies that the timely exposure of a few Iraqi agents could be helpful ; their arrests might help forestall the death sentence Saddam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not spring the trap on its Iraqi quarry until several days after Bazoft was hanged . Even after the hanging and the " sting " arrests , some in the administration were still willing to give Iraq the benefit of the doubt . The Commerce Department was still promoting the sale of American-made high-technology furnaces to Baghdad only days before Saddam invaded Kuwait , even though the furnace manufacturers , a New Jersey manufacturer called Consarc , told authorities the furnaces had " nuclear " applications . <p> Meanwhile , evidence obtained earlier this year by Dingell 's staff indicates that top Energy Department officials appear to have learned little from their mishandling of intelligence about Iraqi nuclear acquisitions . According to an unpublished congressional memo from Dingell to members of his oversight subcommittee , last April Siebert was stripped of his responsibility for export control decisions as a result of a departmental " reorganization . " Siebert 's superiors also gave him a second-rate efficiency rating and ordered him to give a similar rating to his principal deputy , who had supported Siebert 's effort to sound the alarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emel , who against the advice of his superiors had supported Siebert 's initiative , left the Energy Department to work for a private contractor . What 's more , Robert Walsh , the Energy Department intelligence chief who blocked Siebert from alerting Watkins and Secretary of State James Baker , was given the highest performance rating , and under a departmental reorganization he was made Siebert 's new supervisor , according to Dingell 's investigators . <p> It is debatable whether the Bush administration has learned anything from this experience with missed signals about Iraq . Intelligence officials say that information has been flowing in recently about threatening new nuclear activity in the Middle East . Reports now under close study by Pentagon and other government analysts indicate that China and North Korea , which are both desperate for hard currency , are eagerly trying to peddle their nuclear wares to some of the world 's least attractive regimes . One customer is said to be Hafez Assad 's Syria . Another is Iran . Intelligence officials passed several warnings to Baker as he shuttled around the Middle East lining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulating that senior members of Jordanian King Hussein 's inner circle have been involved in attempts to smuggle weapons technology out of the United States and other Western countries . So far , to the frustration of the people with the evidence before them , Baker and other top officials just do n't want to listen . <p> By Mark Hosenball <p> <p> MARK HOSENBALL is a producer at NBC News . <p>
