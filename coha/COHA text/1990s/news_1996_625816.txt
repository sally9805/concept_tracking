<p> It sounds a tad complicated and has been somewhat controversial , but actually it 's a simple judgment call . <p> When the Metropolitan Transit Authority board meets Thursday , it will agree to hand over $ 125 million to the city of Houston over the next 30 months . <p> It is the same agreement that was renewed two years ago and conceived four years ago , totaling a $ 206 million giveaway so far . <p> And it means exactly this : The money is considered better spent on police and potholes than on buses or trains . <p> Put another way , Metro must be so well-funded for its current bus operations and future bus plans and must be doing such a great job that it does n't need the cash . <p> Metro collects a 1-cent sales tax , but " " you can run a good bus company on probably about half a cent , " said County Judge Robert Eckels . <p> " " In the whole scheme of things , it does n't disrupt what Metro 's trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What Metro is trying to do is run a bus service that operates as well as or better than a rail system that Mayor Bob Lanier adamantly opposed as a billion-dollar waste for such a spread-out city . <p> Metro is also charged with improving Houston 's general mobility through road repair and construction . A voter referendum authorized 25 percent of the Metro sales tax to go toward mobility projects , and elected officials have decreed that figure a minimum . <p> This year Metro will spend $ 150 million - about 55 percent of the $ 274 million sales tax it expects to collect - on mobility . <p> Of that mobility money , however , $ 50 million will be a straight cash handout to the city Public Works Department . <p> While the Metro money is technically spent by the city on roads , it means the whole city piggybank grows , and Lanier can spend more money hiring more police and fixing up inner-city neighborhoods . <p> Harris County gets a similar $ 16 million-per-year deal , and the 14 smaller municipalities in Metro 's service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents want , Lanier said emphatically last week when a freshman council member dared challenge him . <p> If Metro has the extra cash to give the city , thanks in part to a war chest saved for the now-defunct rail plan , one might presume Houston 's bus service and future transit funding are satisfactory without it . Metro board members and Lanier say that is the case . <p> " " Metro is probably on a relative basis better funded than any other function in this city , " Lanier said . <p> " " As a matter of fact , at the national level , both the ( Federal ) Transit Administration and the congressional committee said we have moved one of the worst plants in the nation to one of the best , " Lanier said of Metro 's overall performance . <p> Two ways to measure a transit service are by technical standards and community satisfaction , said Chip Bishop , spokesman for the American Public Transit Association . <p> In one technical category , the University of North Carolina at Charlotte last year ranked 108 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards for the years 1988-93 , it ranked Houston 's Metro in the top third at 29th place . <p> San Antonio 's VIA ranked seventh and Dallas Area Rapid Transit Authority ranked 50th . In Metro 's peer group of bus-only urban areas with more than 2 million people , Minneapolis scored 27th and St.Louis scored 76th . <p> But how happy are Harris County residents with their service ? <p> Metro runs 121 regular routes now compared with 109 in 1990 , serving 22 Park &; Ride lots and 14 transit centers . <p> Its buses travel 126,146 service miles per day , compared with 110,496 in 1990 , a gain of 14 percent . <p> Still , bus ridership is down nearly 3 percent from Metro 's peak year of 1992 . That may seem to be a general statement about service . But it is also a statement about the perceived value of taking a bus versus the perceived value of traveling in another fashion . <p> " " Irony of ironies . Metro , as it helps mobility , works against itself , " said Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freeway congestion has improved through massive road spending , in part with Metro funds , driving to work is more tempting , Gee said . Also , a fare increase combined with low consumer gas prices tips the economic balance against Metro . <p> " " I 'd hate to say I want to see our freeways totally clogged or the price of parking downtown to triple , " said Jeff Arndt , Metro 's assistant general manager for transit operations . <p> " " Obviously , we 'd get more ridership from that . " <p> But Metro also could get more ridership in other ways , Arndt admitted , advancing its goals of less crowded roadways and cleaner Houston air . <p> Two of the top passenger requests at Metro are for new service routes and more frequent service on existing routes , Arndt said . Either move would generate more ridership , he said . <p> In its latest service adjustments , however , Metro added and subtracted services to keep its overall operating costs exactly the same . It was a value judgment tailored to a board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city of Houston but wants Metro 's operating budget to toe a line . <p> If you lower bus frequency , you discourage ridership , Gee agreed , but if you raise it , you face taxpayers who see empty buses during nonrush hours . <p> " " Getting that balance is certainly problematical , " he said . <p> A third service issue is travel time . While Metro can get a passenger from the suburbs to downtown quickly on a transit lane , its crosstown service is so slow that few would take it if they had a choice . <p> With more job growth in the suburbs than downtown , Arndt said , Metro is trying to address crosstown needs . An express bus service that travels around the loop rather than downtown is only a year old , but with little apparent marketing effort to support it . <p> Metro 's vanpool service , with 100 participating vans so far , is also pointed out as an innovative suburban service . But it likely will grow less than expected now that Congress has deleted a federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at modified crosstown express buses to cut down on time-consuming stops , Arndt said . <p> As Metro continues to give money to Houston through at least June 1998 , the lasting wisdom of the transfer will be measured in whether the transit system has built all the transit centers and transit lanes that it promised , said Alan Clark , director of the Houston-Galveston Area Council . <p> Many of the lanes and other projects were delayed while the Federal Transit Administration closely scrutinized them , said Francis Britton , Metro assistant general manager for management and budget . The federal agency said that projects like a regional computerization of traffic signals sounded more like aid to automobiles than transit , but Metro finally prevailed . <p> Britton said all parts of Metro 's " " Regional Bus Plan " will be constructed . But as for its timeliness , he said , each year the Metro staff considers transit projects and general mobility on an equal footing . <p> " " Would we have more money available for the Regional Bus Plan ( without general mobility spending ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Clark is a fan of mass transit and warns that Houston 's freeways ca n't expand forever , he said he ca n't completely object to the high spending on general mobility . <p> Many of the projects are needed , he said , and popular support for Metro 's 1 percent tax might falter if citizens do n't see concrete results . <p> Gee , an immigration attorney , said he has spent a good deal of time studying the area 's transportation problems in his year on the board as a Lanier appointee . <p> The 1992 decision to go with buses instead of a rail system was almost certainly the right one , he said . But he agreed that freeways ca n't expand forever , and when Houstonians finally become miserable again in congestion , then a rail-type transit system will come about . <p> It will be much more expensive than building it today , Gee and Clark agreed , and Metro will have to figure out how to fund it . On the other hand , Metro will learn from mistakes made by Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead with rail , Gee said . <p> In the meantime , Gee said , " " I feel we 've got the biggest bang for our buck . I think the ( Metro ) resources have been well spent to serve the city of Houston . " <p> If any residents disagree , they have n't had the clout to change the mind of the City Council , mayor or Metro board with five of nine seats appointed by the mayor . The council approved the new fund-transfer contract last week , and Metro 's board is scheduled to vote Thursday .
