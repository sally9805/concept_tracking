<p> She 's an executive with an Ivy League law degree and a master 's in business administration . She drives a Lexus , sends her kids to private schools , still loves her husband after 20 years and is justifiably proud of her tennis game . <p> She 's also manic-depressive . <p> The diagnosis was made 18 years ago , shortly after she finished her exhaustive schooling . Pregnant with her first child , she was unpacking boxes after a cross-country move to Denver when things began to unravel . <p> Close friends know she had some tough times earlier in life , still sees a therapist and uses anti-depressants . <p> Except for her husband and mother , no one knows she survived " the hell of madness " by opting for electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) 15 years ago . <p> Depression can be a recurring disease . <p> The American Psychiatric Association estimates she is one of 40,000 people in the United States receiving a total of about 1 million ECT treatments a year . In Colorado , 263 people received ECT at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of them , 73 , were seen at Presbyterian-St . Lukes Medical Center . <p> Opponents of the procedure say the patient count is more like 100,000 . <p> " No question , I am alive today because of that machinery , " says the woman , who wo n't let her name be used . " ECT made it possible for me - by clearing up some of the terrible depression , the suicidal stuff - to eventually use anti-depressants and get psychiatric help . " <p> Usually unflappable , she is tapping her desk blotter and crossing and uncrossing her legs . " I will not talk about ECT for attribution because we are such a violent and judgmental society . ECT makes people absolutely wild with anger . " <p> No question . <p> Earlier this year , when Virginia psychologist Martha Manning published " Undercurrents , " an account of her own depression and ECT treatment , she was astounded at the reactions . <p> " We 've had to change our phone number , " she says . " I 'm getting vicious e-mail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusing me of trying to promote some heinous medical boondoggle to fry human minds . <p> " The feminists are in a fury with me . They feel because so many more women are treated with ECT - an estimated 72 percent - this is part of the oppression of women by a paternalistic society . I 'm so surprised . I consider myself one of them . " <p> While some credit ECT with saving their lives , others see it as an unspeakable injury . <p> Although it 's been nearly 30 years since Esso Leete lost her childhood on a hospital bed , she is still angry . <p> The Denver mental-health activist is adamant about the harm done to her as a 19-year-old college freshman . <p> Leete , 48 , was treated with the permission of her well-meaning parents after she became depressed and distracted at school . <p> " I was diagnosed in 1965 with schizophrenia , " says Leete , who works at the Colorado Mental Health Institute at Fort Logan mental hospital . " On my second hospitalization , the doctors convinced my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leete remembers a nurse coming in with a big needle and telling her that the doctor said , " This is good for you . " The nurse would n't explain what was about to happen or why . <p> What happened was horrible , much worse than what doctors predict now , she says . " I lost my whole childhood . I ca n't remember any of it . I feel empty . I do n't have any past to build on . I feel violated by this . Raped . " <p> Leete is still afraid of needles . <p> She thinks that ECT hampered her ability to retain new information . " I can type medical records . I ca n't remember any skills that I might learn now . " <p> While ECT has changed in the past 30 years , Leete still opposes its use . She has been involved with Truth in Psychiatry , an anti-ECT organization in the East , and with Support Coalition , an educational and activist foundation based in Eugene , Ore . <p> " I do n't think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't think they are clear enough about how this works or the memory loss . There is always memory loss , and they ca n't really even tell you how it supposedly works . " <p> Also opposing ECT is the Citizens Commission on Human Rights , established in 1969 by the Church of Scientology . Members lobby state legislatures against ECT , sending out reams of information and offering " ECT survivors " for interviews . <p> Doctors , however , say a new day has dawned for electroconvulsive therapy . Invented in 1936 , it had fallen out of favor by the ' 70s . By then , highly effective psychotropic , anti-psychotic , anti-anxiety and anti-depressant drugs developed in the ' 50s were in vogue . Pills increasingly seemed to be the answer , and ECT was seen as snakepit psychiatry . <p> Drugs do n't work for everyone , though . For the past 15 years , what some doctors claim is an improved ECT technique has racked up impressive success rates in the treatment of depression . Some doctors and patients consider it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethical doctor prescribes it without first trying drugs or psychotherapy , doctors agree . <p> Still , ETC remains a public-relations nightmare . It does n't matter to most of the public that in 100,000 cases studied nationwide , there were no fractures or broken bones - that the paralyzing agent now used prevents convulsing . <p> Most Americans remember Jack Nicholson writhing and drooling in " One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest " and still use the misnomer " shock therapy " for the treatment . <p> " If people witnessed this , they would be disappointed because it 's not very dramatic , " says Dr. Frank Guerra , a **29;1187;TOOLONG and an associate professor at CU . <p> " The patient is entirely still except for one foot which moves slightly , an indication that the stimulus has been effective . " Guerra , at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , does more ECT than any other doctor in the area . <p> The room where the procedure is performed at CU is anti-climatic . It 's institutional white and smells antiseptic . A small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cords and electrodes are coiled neatly on a counter with a few more machines , including an EKG . <p> It 's remarkable more for its lack of bells and whistles than for its high-tech glamor . <p> Remembering the dead frog 's macabre dance after being zapped by an electrical current in high school biology , it 's hard to pay attention to the American Journal of Psychiatry statement : " The efficacy and safety of ECT are well-established , particularly for major depression , bipolar mania and depression , and some forms of schizophrenia " <p> Says Dr. Randy Busan , who works with Guerra , " There is memory loss , generally around the time of the session . But depression itself impairs memory . So how can we tell the cause of the loss ? " <p> Some patients tested months after receiving ECT had higher IQ scores , Busan says . <p> No one understands why a " trickle of electricity of about a half second in duration works , " he says . " But we did n't understand how aspirin worked until the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the 1800s . " <p> ECT is almost unimaginable . <p> The patient is put to sleep and given a muscle relaxant intravenously . Electrodes are attached to the head . Electricity then is passed through the brain for about half a second . <p> The grand mal seizure caused by the electricity changes the brain 's chemistry . No one knows exactly why . <p> Usually , a total of six to 12 sessions of ECT are prescribed , administered two or three times a week . During that time , patients can not drive or work . <p> The consent form for ECT is seven pages long . <p> In Guerra 's experience , the patients most afraid to have ECT are computer scientists . He does n't know why . <p> " This is about understanding the brain in a physical way , " Guerra says . " It is part of better science ; taking psychiatry a step away from Freud . The brain is a physical entity , just as the heart and liver are . What 's extraordinary about this is that you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to the brain . <p> " ECT changes the chemistry of the brain . We can change the way in which a particular set of neurons are firing . We can save people 's lives . " <p> Guerra gets impatient with the controversy , though he is not afraid of discussion . <p> " Psychiatrists are not proselytizers for ECT . We are practitioners of medicine . We are rational people treating depressed , sometimes suicidal , people in the best way that I can . I am sent these patients . I do not seek them out . " <p> Local physicians point to the consent form as an important change in ECT . <p> " This is not cruel and unusual punishment , " says Dr. Edmund Casper , head of Alcohol , Drug and Psychiatric Service at Denver General Hospital . " The consent form , the processes through which we go to ensure that the patient understands the process and side effects , is designed to keep everyone safe . This is not a procedure done without an enormous amount of consultation . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placement of electrodes , how much electricity to emit and better ways to paralyze muscles - the consent form is paramount . <p> " It is the check and balance that helps doctor and patient . It enables us to prepare patients , " he says . " But finally , I think what counts is the heart of the doctor . If the doctor has a good heart , he will treat his patients well . " <p> Another issue that many doctors cite is elitism . All too often , it is a treatment of the upper classes . ECT is fairly expensive - about $ 400 a session in area hospitals , and Medicare pays only $ 85.25 . <p> Guerra does pro-bono work , but says , " I think that social policy should change . I do n't know that many people who could benefit are n't shut out for monetary reasons . And it may be that the more educated among us are more aware of scientific process and reasoning . "
