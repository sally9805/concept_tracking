<p> FIGHTING among rival rebel groups , and not drought , is the main cause of the alarming levels of death and malnutrition in parts of southern Sudan , according to officials of the United Nations World Food Programme providing famine relief here . <p> The infighting is strongly condemned - by the UN , the United States government , and the human rights group Amnesty International - for adding to the misery of civilians in the region . But the leaders of both sides , interviewed in this rebel stronghold in the far south and in Nairobi , Kenya , say they are prepared to keep on fighting each other for supremacy . <p> " It will only be a short time when we shall move , " says Faustino Atem Gualdit , a leader of a breakaway rebel group , warning of an imminent attack on the main faction of the Sudanese People 's Liberation Army ( SPLA ) , a largely non-Muslim movement based in the south of the country , which has fought the Islamic regime in the capital Khartoum since 1983 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the government granted the south more autonomy . The SPLA was formed to resume the battle in 1983 , after autonomy was weakened and Islamic law or sharia was imposed throughout the country . <p> But since 1991 , the rebels have fractured into several rival groups , which have clashed occasionally . The frequency of such battles has increased in recent weeks as three breakaway groups have begun to work together , announcing their formal unity April 5 under the name SPLA United . <p> Interviews with rebel leaders and with independent , non-Sudanese church and academic analysts provide new glimpses into the inner workings of the SPLA . It is a world where dissident rebels allegedly suffer long imprisonment in darkened , tightly packed cells in the bush , and where SPLA leader Col. John Garang has lost considerable support amid criticism that he is a dictator and a poor military strategist . <p> And in an important political development , the rebel dissidents have spoken out in favor of an independent southern Sudan . " We are for independence , through negotiations - or fighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was educated in the US , has long favored a stronger role for the south in a united Sudan free of religious laws . <p> Recently , however , he has begun to speak of two confederated states , one in the north and one in the south " sovereign in their constitution . " <p> The few people who have analyzed the SPLA say that , for the most part , Garang 's army has shown little concern for the people it claims to represent : the civilians of the south . <p> " I have found very few SPLA people who really care about their people , " says a church minister in Nairobi who spoke on condition of anonymity . Two exceptions , the minister says , may be prominent SPLA United leaders Lam Akol Ajawin and Kerubino Kwanyin Bol . Garang , the minister adds , is definitely in this " for his own power . " Personal rivalries <p> The splits " probably begin with ... rivalries in the movement " based not on political differences but on " very personal motives " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Brookings Institution in Washington . Their motives are cloaked in ideological justifications such as furthering democracy and human rights , he adds . <p> Garang and SPLA United leaders have " lost all credibility in the West " for pursing their rivalries while people are starving , says history professor Robert Collins of the University of California at Santa Barbara . <p> James Michel , acting administrator of the US Agency for International Development , recently blasted the fighting among the rebels as " a callous disregard for human life among those who claim to be fighting for the people of the region . " <p> Last November , Amnesty International accused the Nasir faction , one of the SPLA breakaway groups , of killing " over 2,000 Dinka civilians in an assault in January 1992 on Bor , the home area of John Garang . " That , and an attack in the Bahr al-Ghazal region , sent " tens of thousands of civilians " fleeing for safety and food , according to the human rights group . <p> The rival rebel leaders " have no vision about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a telephone interview . " This breeds contempt in Khartoum and Washington , " he said , citing conversations with some members of the US Congress and Western relief officials . <p> Garang 's Chief of Staff , Salva Kiir Mayardit , dismisses the breakaway group as " not a threat to our movement . " <p> Collins predicts the unity forged by the breakaway factions will disintegrate , following a historic pattern among the chiefless people of this Nile region of not uniting between or even within tribes . Sudanese war and politics are based largely on tribalism , and many southerners fear potential domination by the Dinkas , the largest southern tribe . <p> But leaders of the SPLA United and several church sources in Nairobi say unity will eventually prevail , if for no other reason than to allow free movement of cattle across tribal boundaries . <p> For now , fighting continues , with the sides recently clashing near the town of Ayod . <p> In an interview in Nairobi April 12 , the SPLA United 's Mr. Kerubino predicted that Garang would continue to lose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " referring to himself and two fellow escapees from Garang 's prisons , Arok Thon Arok , and Mr. Faustino . <p> Sitting on a bed , for lack of chairs in a house they recently moved into , the three endorsed the idea of a " collective leadership " in the SPLA United , as opposed to what Kerubino described as Garang 's attempt to run a " one-man show . " Imprisoned by Garang <p> When first detained in 1987 after policy disputes with Garang , the three were put in holes in the ground and held for several days , Faustino says . Then , for more than three months , he says , they were held in a container only 5 feet by 7 feet , packed with other prisoners . There was room for only a few at a time to rest . <p> They escaped , he says , by convincing the young guards that their imprisonment was not fair . The guards then escaped with them . <p> Asked to describe the prison conditions in which the three were held , Mr. Salva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taken good care of . Nobody tortured them . " <p> During his imprisonment , Kerubino says , four of his sons - Daniel Malang , 16 ; Aguak , 15 ; Stephen Dumbaai , 12 ; and Lokoni , 11 - were sent by Garang , along with other children , for military training in Cuba and have now been returned , against his will , to southern Sudan . He claims they are being held hostage . <p> A senior SPLA commander , contacted in Nairobi , acknowledged that the children had been returned from Cuba , but said the International Committee of the Red Cross was free to go pick them up in southern Sudan . He did not say why they were not returned to Kerubino in the first place . <p> Even if the southern rebels work out their differences , the war in the south against the Khartoum government is likely to go on for at least another decade , according to Collins , church sources , and key rebel leaders on both sides .
