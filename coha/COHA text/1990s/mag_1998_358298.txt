Investors are courting an old flame : bond mutual funds . But how sincere are their intentions ? The relationship sputtered in 1994 , when bond funds logged their worst year in six decades and investors fled the church in a panic . Now they 're back for another fling . In January net new cash flowing into bond funds surged to an estimated $11.5 billion  --  the most since August 1993 . The disturbing thing is that people probably do n't understand this fickle mate any better today than they did in 1994 . <P> The underappreciated irony of bond funds is that while they invest in bonds they do n't behave like them . Bond funds can not guarantee return of principal because , unlike individual bonds ( and perhaps your ex ) , they never mature ; bond-fund returns , unlike bonds held until maturity , are tied as much to daily price movement as to the interest rate they pay . And the income generated , rather than being fixed , vacillates with market rates . These differences are so fundamental that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're more like a stock . In fact , if you have money in a bond fund , what you really own is common stock in a company that invests in bonds . That stock goes up and down along with the value of the company 's assets , which in this case are mostly bonds but sometimes include exotic derivative securities . Clearly , investors seeking to preserve capital and earn a fixed-income stream for a set period of time have no business flirting with such a beast . They should go for individual bonds . Yet bond funds are routinely marketed and accepted as apt substitutes . <P> Bond funds do have some good features . They are easy to buy and sell . The minimum investment is in the thousands  --  not the tens of thousands , as with many individual bonds . And in a stable interest-rate environment , bond funds really are a suitable bond substitute . Just make sure you know what you 're getting . There are plenty of low-risk , short-maturity funds . It 's the funds that buy 10- , 20- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incidentally , are staples in 401(k) plans . Many people had no idea what they had got into back in ' 94 , when rates soared and , according to Lipper Analytical Services , the average general Treasury-bond fund fell 6% . " Bond-fund risk is just not well understood , " notes John Rea , an economist with the industry trade group Investment Company Institute . <P> So why are bond funds suddenly so popular ? The Asian economic crisis chased some investors to perceived safe havens like Treasury bonds . But mainly it 's a play on interest rates , which could reach dramatic new lows if inflation continues to subside . When rates fall , bond funds excel . That was the case in ' 95 , when T-bond funds returned an average 22% . But there 's an insidious side to bond funds even when rates are falling : the income streams they provide decline because fund managers must buy new bonds that pay ever lower interest . The $1 billion PIMCO High Yield Fund paid 10cents a share in interest income as recently as September . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haircut . The decline is largely the result of $200 billion of new money invested at lower interest rates .
