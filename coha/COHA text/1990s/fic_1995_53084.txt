Bobby wanted to practice it on his mother , but he knew her face would turn red , then purple , and he 'd see all the veins pulsing in her head . Smoke would pour from her ears and nose . Her eyes would pinwheel , and sparks would fly . Her lips would disappear in a tight mean line . She 'd start vibrating and humming , and the top of her head would blow off like the lid of a steam kettle , and everything inside would run down her face , melting her until there 'd be nothing left but a puddle of Mom stuff . So Bobby told her he was going out , instead . <p> He let the rusty spring on the screen door have its way as he ran from the kitchen into the Arizona sunshine and summer bug noise , and he was almost out of sight when he heard the satisfying bang ! that made all the peacocks scream . <p> Bobby lazed on down the street , Main Street , the only street , a dirt road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Swarms of summertime flies buzzed around his head . He pulled at his jeans and the shorts riding up in the crack of his butt . He kept an eye out for whirlwinds to stand in as he practiced flipping birds , the middle finger of his right hand snicking out like the blade of a switchblade knife . <p> Do it once , then do it twice , then do it again , This was a necessary man type skill his cousin fat Edward , who was thirteen and should know , had told him . Necessary for a gee man , Bobby thought Ibut never said because that 's what he was going to be  --  a gee man and maybe get himself a good golly molly . Twist and shout ! Yes . He flipped off the sky . <p> And the sky said , " Hey ! " <p> Bobby tipped his head back to see a man in a cage . The cage hung from a high branch of the biggest oak tree around . Jail tree . Everyone called the prisoner Robert ; everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bar girls . Bobby flipped him off . <p> Robert held the bars of the cage with both hands and glared down at Bobby . " Do n't do that , Bobby B. " <p> " That 's not my name , " Bobby said and held up his fist and triggered his finger again . Just when his middle finger snapped into position , he jabbed at Robert with his whole hand  --  a nice bit of style , Bobby thought . <p> " I told you not to do that ! " Robert yelled . He pumped his legs and the cage swung on its rope . Bobby showed him his bird again . <p> Robert had gotten the cage going around in a circle , and now he crashed it against the trunk of the oak tree . " You just wait till I get out of here ! " <p> Bobby flipped him off again , and then as Robert slumped to the floor of the cage and broke into tears , Bobby ran off down Main Street . <p> What was it about this gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man cry ? Such power and magic . It was like when he 'd called his cousin Edward a cocksucker , a term he 'd gotten from Edward in the first place . Edward had chased him around and around the barn yelling that he 'd kill him if he ever got his hands around Bobby 's pussy neck . Cats and chickens . It did n't make a lot of sense . There was something potent and dirty about sucking on roosters , but Bobby could n't figure what it could be . Cock Robin . Or maybe something to do with devil worship@ he 'd heard they liked to kill things and drink blood , or maybe geeks , the way Edward said they liked to bite the heads off chickens and suck the eggs up through the bleeding top . But would n't that make it hensucking ? <p> Bobby discovered a new refinement . As the middle finger of his right hand snicked out , he slapped the whole hand into his left palm , making a sharp smack that scared birds from the rooftops and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road in front of him . <p> Coiled , pastel pink and blue and orange and green , the duckbill rattlesnake snarled , showing its daffy little needlesharp teeth . It swept its head left and right keeping its bright eyes on Bobby . The snake 's dry rattle was so fast Bobby could n't see the tail move . He stopped in his tracks and flipped off the snake . <p> The snake froze like it could n't believe its eyes , then picked up its rattle twice as fast and hard as before . It hissed and spit at Bobby , who jumped to the side and jabbed his middle finger into the air , yelled " Yii ! " then jumped again . The snake twisted around to follow Bobby , who kept moving and yelling and flipping it off . Just as Bobby thought he 'd finally gotten the snake to knot itself , a car came barreling out of nowhere and honking its horn like crazy . Bobby jumped out of the way , and the car ran over the snake . Squashed it flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when old Mr. Klein poked his head out of the side window to look back and shake his fist at Bobby , Bobby flipped a bird at him . <p> Mr. Klein braked hard , and the car skidded sideways and crashed into the Bait and Tackle Shop . Bobby hurried on down Main Street . <p> Mrs. Stokes stood hugging a brown paper bag on the steps of the Grocery Store . " Do n't slouch so , Bobby , " she said . <p> Bobby flipped her off . <p> Mrs. Stokes collapsed like she 'd suddenly been unplugged . <p> Bobby jerked around like a gun fighter and flipped off the Dime Store , and the store exploded , spewing up electric trains and stuffed animals , comic books and pieces of plastic airplane models . <p> Bobby flipped off the Bright White Church on the corner , and it jumped into the air then fell onto its side with a splintering crash and the sounds of breaking glass . Flipping fast and furious now , Bobby turned the Little Red Schoolhouse into a big pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , and smoke filled its windows . The mayor ran out screaming , " Fire ! Fire ! " <p> Downtown was beginning to look war-torn , worse for wear , maybe tornado-struck . <p> " You 're not being very nice , Bobby , " said the West Witch , ugly as sin his father called her , where she sat on the boardwalk with her plastic bag of empty vegetable cans and bits of bright yarn and corked bottles of powders and potions . Bobby flipped her off . <p> The witch 's eyes got big then she grinned , and Bobby could see she had no teeth . " Maybe you just need something sweet to suck on . A sweet tooth . Or two . " She wiggled her eyebrows up and down at him , and sweetness filled his mouth . Chocolate . He backed away , sucking at his teeth . His front teeth . His chocolate teeth , and they were getting smaller fast , dissolving . <p> The witch sat rocking and slapping her knees and laughing at him , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to do was knock off her ragged bonnet , and that just seemed to make her laugh harder . <p> Bobby swallowed the last of his chocolate and ran on down the street , tonguing the space where his top front teeth had been . He stopped in front of the still standing Hardware Store where he knew there was a mirror in the window . He was so much older now , growing up before his very eyes . He watched in dismay as his new teeth came in . He was a chipmunk . How could he be a gee man if he looked like a big chipmunk ? No , a beaver . Bobby the Beaver . There was something about beavers , too , something that put a sly smile on Edward 's face . He 'd never figure it out in time . You 're always a day late and a dollar short , his father liked to say . Bobby flipped off the Hardware Store , reducing it to piles of lumber and nails , tools and electrical parts , pipes and toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad posture , and slouched on down the smoky street , getting bigger , stumbling into adolescence , feeling mean and shooting I-Meant-To-Do-That ! glances around whenever he tripped over his own feet , kicking the town 's rubble out of his way , taking time to flip off the county deputy and send his car tumbling with the tumble weeds . Stinking black leather jacket and dirty jeans , torn basketball shoes , flattop , a cool fool , coming up on Molly , the East Witch , as beautiful as the other one was ugly , saying , hey baby . The once-over for this one in her tight purple skirt and lacy white deep-vee blouse , brown and white shoes and bobby sox . Once-over was not enough , so the twice-over . Her dog a blond lab , sat by her side giving Bobby the eye , an Elvis sneer on its lips , and a little rumbling growl coming from somewhere deep inside . <p> " Keep your eyes to yourself , Bobby B , " Molly said . <p> So what could he do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " All right for you , Bobby . You asked for it . " She raised an eyebrow . <p> What was it , he wondered , with these women and their eyebrows ? Something pulled his eyes closed , and when he touched his face , he discovered that his eyelashes had grown long and heavy , so long , in fact , that they fell to his chest . He had to take a handful of eyelashes in each hand and pull them up and away from his eyes before he could see Molly standing there smirking with one hand on a cocked hip and a cigarette in the other . She blew a smoky kiss his way . <p> " I do n't suppose you 'd let me shine my gee man flashlight in your face ? " Bobby asked . <p> " JC does n't like that kind of talk , Bobby . " She put her hand on the dog 's head . <p> " You named your dog after Jesus Christ ? " <p> " No . After Joseph Campbell . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , circled around young Bobby B , and bit him in the seat of the pants . <p> Bobby dropped his eyelashes , but he could still see the sudden light . Teen epiphany . He was seized by a sudden need to rip off his clothes , run into the woods , and beat on a drum until his father came down out of the trees . <p> He turned and shouldered his way through the ragged refugees toward the end of Main Street and the wilderness beyond . <p> Just outside the remains of town , Edward jumped up from behind a big Ocotillo and flipped Bobby off with both hands while doing a shimmy like he had a tail to wag . " Take that , beaver face ! " he shouted . <p> " Same to you ! " Bobby grinned and flipped Edward off so hard his cousin 's ears were pinned back . <p> " All right ! " Edward slugged Bobby in the shoulder , and the two of them walked on , and as they walked , guys popped up from behind cacti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Snick . Like a running gun battle , but Bobby and Edward were too fast , and the vanquished soon fell in behind them , and by the time the sun had set , a Society of Men had formed . <p> They built a fire . They killed and cooked some rabbits . The moon soon gave them the cold shoulder . Coyotes sang . Backslapping , spitting , and farting , the men squatted with their drams in a circle around Bobby , who would soon exclaim sweet gee manly poetry . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Wonder Woman : THE CONTEMPLATIVE YEARS <p> <p> By Ray Vukcevich <p> Ray Vukcevich has become a word-of-mouth sensation in the science fiction field .
