Section : A case against peremptory challenges . <p> A black and Hispanic jury in Brooklyn has acquitted the black teenager charged in the murder of Yankel Rosenbaum . A white jury in Simi Valley , California , refused to convict the accused white assailants of Rodney King . The symmetrical verdicts are being invoked to support a radically separatist premise : that jurors can never overcome their racial loyalties and prejudices , that race is inseparable from justice . Multiculturalists on the left and traditionalists on the right are now saying that American juries should be more racially contrived , not less ; and that the false promise of colorblind justice should be abandoned . The truth is the separatist premise is both empirically questionable and constitutionally offensive . And the problem with recent Supreme Court decisions is that they do not go far enough in prohibiting the exclusion of jurors based on stereotypes of any kind . <p> Until recently the Supreme Court 's pronouncements about race and juries were wildly inconsistent . One line of cases steadily expanded the representative character of the jury pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not the actual jury panels  --  reflect a " fair cross-section " of the community from which they were drawn . ( See " Racial Justice " by Andrew Kull , page 17 . ) In a separate line of cases , however , the Court permitted prosecutors and defense attorneys to engage in covert racial discrimination during jury selection . The mechanism was a system of peremptory challenges , in which both sides are allowed to strike a specific number of jurors without giving any reasons at all . <p> Traditionally , prosecutors and defense attorneys used their peremptory challenges to exclude jurors based on the crudest racial stereotypes : a 1973 Dallas County prosecutors manual advised that peremptories should be used to eliminate " any member of a minority group " because " you are not looking for a fair juror , but rather a strong , biased , and sometimes hypocritical individual who believes that Defendants are different from them in kind , rather than degree . " Well into the 1980s , Southern officials used their peremptory challenges to ensure that few blacks actually sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court dramatically reversed itself , holding that when prosecutors use their peremptory challenges to keep blacks off juries , even for strategic reasons , they violate the potential jurors ' right to equal protection of the laws . ( Last June the Court applied the same reasoning to defense attorneys . ) But in a series of dissents and concurrences , the conservative justices  --  Burger , Rehnquist , Scalia , and Thomas  --  have fervently defended the use of racial stereotypes in jury selection . Burger called peremptory challenges " a system that allows the covert expression of what we dare not say but know is true more often than not ' , " namely , that defendants are likely to sympathize with members of their own race and be hostile to members of others . It was reasonable to surmise , Thomas declared , " without direct evidence in any particular case , that all-white juries might judge black defendants unfairly . " <p> The conservative defense of racial stereotyping in jury selection is remarkable on several levels . It is ironic , to say the least , coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmative action programs as a betrayal of colorblind principles . And Rehnquist , Scalia , and Thomas have managed to restrain their concern for black criminal defendants on most other occasions . Their position seems so unprincipled that several legal scholars I talked to suspect some sort of hidden agenda : they think the conservative justices want to preserve peremptory challenges because they fear that Republican white-collar defendants , such as Elliot Abrams , are unlikely to get justice from all-black juries in the District of Columbia . <p> Most surprising of all , the conservative position is hard to distinguish from that of scholars on the left , like Sheri Lynn Johnson of Cornell Law School , who support explicit racial quotas in jury selection . Believing that white jurors are inherently racist , Johnson argues that defendants should have the right to be tried by at least three jurors from their own racial group . Or , as a 1970 note in the Yale Law Journal puts it , " The black litigant and the black community are protected equally not when there is equal opportunity for blacks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This sounds oddly like Clarence Thomas in 1992 . <p> In addition to being constitutionally offensive , these simplistic assertions about the inherent racism of jurors are empirically questionable . Some studies of voting patterns by mock juries do support a phenomenon psychologists call " in-group bias , " in which jurors tend to favor parties of their own race . No one would deny that racial sympathy plays some role in the deliberations of some jurors . But a recent survey of the empirical literature in the Nebraska Law Review also points to a more nuanced conclusion : in many cases , minority jurors tend to favor defendants , regardless of race , because they are suspicious of policemen of all races . <p> The behavior of the predominantly black juries in D.C. seems to support this phenomenon . The percentage of defendants who are not convicted in the D.C. federal court is one of the highest in the nation : 41 percent of jury trials this year have ended in acquittals , hung juries , or mistrials . ( The national average is about 20 percent . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of acquittals in D.C. increased more than five-fold , from eleven in 1989 to sixty-two in 1991 . There are several theories about the increasing reluctance of black jurors in D.C. to convict defendants of all ethnic backgrounds . One is the draconian minimum sentences laws passed by Congress in the 1980s . Jay Stephens , the U.S. Attorney for the District , has made a policy of prosecuting small-time drug cases in federal rather than local court , to take advantage of the new law . According to published interviews , many jurors find the minimum sentences so unfair ( a first offender gets five years for five grams of cocaine ) that they prefer to ignore the law than to apply it . <p> But the most powerful explanation is that black jurors have grown so mistrustful of the ( mostly black ) police force that even trivial inconsistencies in testimony are enough to convince them that the police are lying . As a law clerk last year at the U.S. Court of Appeals in D.C. , I would occasionally steal upstairs to the district court to watch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight to twelve black jurors , and a black or Hispanic defendant accused of possessing a small amount of crack . In several cases , the defendant had been caught with the drugs , but the jury refused to convict because of minor disagreements among the arresting officers . In one of them , the police had a tip that a man was selling drugs out of his apartment , got a warrant , and found the man cooking crack in his kitchen . But because the two arresting officers disagreed at trial about whether the crack pan was on the stove or the kitchen table , jurors refused to convict . <p> Friends who clerked on the district court often went back to talk to the jurors after the verdicts . They reported that the jurors who voted to acquit consistently said they thought the police had been lying . Whatever the source of the jurors ' mistrust  --  the most common theory is that black jurors empathize with defendants of all races because they resent having been unfairly hassled by the police  --  it reflects something more complicated than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 percent black , and the Federal Public Defender 's Office reports that black jurors vote to acquit roughly the same percentage of Hispanic and white defendants as black ones . <p> Perhaps the strongest evidence for the view that minority jurors favor defendants of all races is that prosecutors and defense attorneys have traditionally relied on it in exercising their peremptory challenges . Here is Clarence Darrow in 1936 : <p> The Irishman and the Jew , because of their national background , will put a greater burden on the prosecution and prove more sympathetic and lenient to a defendant , than an Englishman or a Scandinavian whose passion for the enforcement of the law and order is stronger . <p> And here is Jury Selection : Strategy and Science , a comprehensive manual for defense attorneys published in 1991 : <p> Stereotypically , people from a Mediterranean population are considered desirable as jurors for the plaintiff . Those of Italian , Spanish , and French descent are thought to empathize more readily with the human and emotional side of a lawsuit . Also , those of Slavic , Irish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are thought to fall into this stereotypical category . Persons of German , Scandinavian , Swedish , Finnish , Dutch , Nordic , Scottish , Asiatic and Russian heritage tend to be stereotypically better for the criminal prosecution . Law and order is highly regarded among these groups . <p> Clearly , the real problem with the Supreme Court decisions restricting the use of peremptory challenges is that they do not go far enough . Prosecutors and defense attorneys remain free to strike potential jurors for any reason they please  --  body language , sex , religion , sexual orientation , clothing , occupation , or haircut  --  as long as they pretend not to be striking them on the basis of race . In light of the recent Supreme Court decisions , lower courts have upheld peremptory strikes based on a prospective juror 's " posture and demeanor , " " poor attitude in answering questions , " " nodding ... a little bit too much toward defense counsel and not enough toward me , " and even exuding " something that seemed unfavorable . " In a recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seven blacks in the jury pool for " racially neutral " reasons  --  one because he was " unkempt and gruff " ; another because he resembled the ( black ) defendant ; another because he was " unemployed , " and so forth . <p> The only principled solution is the one Justice Thurgood Marshall proposed in 1986 : the elimination of all peremptory challenges . This is the direction in which the Court is heading : the only question is whether it will continue to chip away at the peremptories one at a time , or whether it will do away with them in a clean stroke . The opportunity should present itself in the next year or so , when the Court almost certainly will be asked to decide whether peremptory strikes based on gender are unconstitutional . ( " Stereotypically , " says the 1991 Jury Selection manual , " it has been thought that women jurors are more receptive to emotional arguments regarding pain and suffering .... Men are more tolerant of violence .... Homosexual males are thought to be an exception to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between race and gender discrimination ; but there is also no principled justification for discrimination based on clothing or class . As Albert Alschuler of the University of Chicago argues in a recent issue of the Chicago Law Review , a system of peremptory challenges that allows attorneys to classify and exclude jurors on the basis of crude stereotypes , ugly hunches , and " what we dare not say but know is true " can not be consistent with the Constitution . <p> The abolition of peremptory challenges would transform jury trials in important ways . The peremptory challenge is a convenient way of excluding irrational jurors  --  those who may not show identifiable biases but give the impression of being somehow bizarre . These tend to be the holdout jurors ; and if more of them were seated on jury panels , they would probably produce more hung juries . This would be bad for the government but good for defendants , which makes it all the more suspicious that Scalia and Thomas are fighting to preserve peremptory challenges . <p> But abolishing peremptory challenges would have dramatic benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science experts , and jury selection manuals ; and it would reduce the expense of assembling huge jury pools in the most routine cases . The parties , moreover , would continue to have the option , as they do now , of challenging potential jurors " for cause . " To support a challenge " for cause , " you have to present concrete evidence that an individual juror is likely to be biased in a particular case . Judges would retain the discretion to grant or deny the requests , but would likely take a more liberal view of " for cause " challenges than they do under the current system . <p> Most importantly , eliminating peremptory challenges would put the separatist premise to an acid test : forcing prosecutors and defense attorneys to provide evidence of bias rather than relying on lazy stereotypes . ( The fact that the stereotypes are sometimes true is all the more reason to prove them in individual cases . ) And the competing , colorblind faith  --  that defendants of all races can be judged fairly by juries drawn randomly from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tested as well . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Jeff Rosen <p>
