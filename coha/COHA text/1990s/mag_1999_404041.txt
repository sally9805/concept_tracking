" When I got to ( Grace 's house , the first thing I said to her was Do you have makeup ?

Grace , a human-resources manager at an accounting firm who is still waiting , she says , " to meet the right guy , " admits she sometimes envies Denise 's bustling life . But she has never felt one twinge of bitterness . " Denise has made me so much a part of her family , " she says . " I was her maid of honor , and I 'm her first daughter 's godmother . " In 1981 , when Denise got engaged , she raced to the restaurant where Grace then waited tables to share the news . " I was shaking , I was so excited for her , " says Grace . " You 'd have thought I had just gotten engaged . " Just recently , Grace bought her first house , in Bloomfield , NJ .

The two have also shared sad times . Grace helped Denise through two crises-her mother 's cancer battle and her firefighter husband 's near-fatal fall from a building while on the job . Denise says , " She always comes through for me , no questions asked . One night when my mother was ill and I could n't sleeps I called Grace very late-maybe two or three in the morning-and she just listened to me for hours . And when my husband was in the hospital , Grace immediately took my children so I could be with him . " Grace 's support goes beyond the practical " She 's one of the few people I can break down in front of , " says Denise . " I guess because we 've known each other since we were children , I can really be myself with her in a way that I ca n't with anyone else .

" We 'll each roll our eyes at the exact same time if someone says something stupid , " says Charlene , " or we 'll crack up at something that only we find funny . " When that connection kicks in , it 's as if the two 33-year-old Midwestern moms are kids again , honing their telepathic powers during sleep overs at each other 's houses . Dana remembers : " Charlene would concentrate on something-like an apple-and I 'd try to guess what she was thinking of . " From the day the two 8-year-olds met in Holt , MI , they had their own little world . Not that they lived a Norman Rockwell childhood . Charlene and Dana both struggled with family tensions , and when fights erupted , each found support with the other . " We 'd lie on a blanket , staring at the sky , and talk and talk , " says Dana . By high school , they had earned the nicknames Mutt and Jeff-Dana 's five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't just their heights that distinguished them . " I 'm a little wilder and more of an airhead , " says Dana , who confesses to sporting two tattoos . " Char 's much more down to earth . She grounds me . " Their friendship has also gone through rough patches . When she got married , Dana chose someone else-a close friend of her husband's-to be maid of honor . Charlene was deeply hurt . Two years later , the rift widened dramatically when Charlene got married , and Dana did n't show up at the wedding , did n't call to explain , and did n't even send a gift . Dana did phone a few months later to apologize-she was eight months pregnant and sick with the flu when her friend got married-but Charlene was still angry . Two silent years passed . " One day I started praying , asking for this special friend to come back into my life , " says Charlene . " The next day , she called . " Dana , it turned out , had also been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wished things had been done differently , and we also decided not to talk about it anymore , " says Charlene . In no time the two women , who live near Grand Rapids , MI , were confidantes again . Dana , now a customer-service representative and mother of two , says , " I was out of work for awhile , and Charlene was the one I needed to talk to . She 's supportive in a way that no one else can be . " As for Dana 's devotion to Charlene , a film and camera merchandiser , it was proved beyond question when she acted as labor coach . ( Charlene 's husband had agreed to a third child only if he did n't have to be in the delivery room . ) Though Dana 's very squeamish , when push came to shove ( so to speak ) , she did n't flinch . As Dallas Recker entered the world , both women started sobbing . " It did n't seem gruesome at all , " says Dana . " I guess it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " jo &june:; Photograph " We 've given each other a lot of support-and laughs . says June Kapell. right . of her six-and-a-half  --  decade-long friendship with Jo Wood . // Giving Each Other Strength Gripped by grief , Jo Wood walked to the telephone to call her oldest friend , June Kapell . Jo 's husband , Bill , had just been admitted to the hospital after years of suffering with bladder cancer-a fight he now seemed perilously close to losing . Just then , the phone rang . It was June , breaking the news that her own husband had died of a sudden heart attack . " We both fell apart , " says Jo . " It was quite a phone call . " That winter , after their husbands had died , both women withdrew into their cocoons . " But we talked on the phone , giving each other whatever support we could , " says Jo . Five years later , they 're still coping with the deep pain of losing a husband-together . " We give each other stability , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other laughs . " My daughter thinks we 're a riot , " says Jo , 74 . " She drove us to a party , and somehow we got onto a conversation about basketball . I remembered the green bloomers we had to wear under our skirts when we played basketball in high school , and we just started laughing hysterically . " The friendship of these two women is firmly anchored to the salty beaches and white-clapboard houses of the island of Martha 's Vineyard in Massachusetts . Jo and June were raised on " the Vineyard , " becoming pals at age 5 . In high school , they made a stab at songwriting , entering a contest to come up with a song for their senior class . Showing a distinctly unteenlike taste , they wrote it to the tune of the Largo movement in Dvorak 's New World Symphony ( and lost ) . The duo dissolved after departing for college in different states and then moving on to their adult lives : working and raising children . " It was n't until we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the summer and found that June was my neighbor , that we rekindled our friendship , " says Jo . They now own summer homes across the street from each other  --  but still pick up the phone three times a day " to talk about whatever . " When fall arrives , they separate with a touch of regret : Jo returns to her home in Dix Hills , NY , and June to hers in Teaneck , NJ . " But we still talk on the phone a lot , " says June . Though they 've never had a cross word in six and a half decades , the two women do enjoy poking a bit of fun at each other . " We 're kind of like the Odd Couple , " says Jo . " She 's a bit of a neatnik , and I tease her about that , and she teases me about being messy , " says June . " My kitchen table is a repository for all things . She 's very amused by it . She would never let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two women get together with six other pals from elementary and high school , many of whom still live on the Vineyard . Says June : " We have fun , but Jo and I are always happy to get back to just each other . Our relationship is hard to explain . We have-what do they call it these days ? - energy . There 's something between us that just flows . " * Sidebar Bosom Buddies What does it mean to be a really good friend ? For some answers , we took a look back at classic gal pals from the big and little screens : Lucy &; Ethel Week after week , on I Love Lucy , TV 's zaniest housewives showed us that a good friend is someone who sticks around when the going gets sticky . Take Ethel . Did she bolt when Lucy bluffed , " I 'm a big dipper from way back , " at the chocolate factory , winning them jobs on a superfast assembly line ? No , ma'am-Ethel stood by her ditzy , fibbing friend , frantically helping her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And did she back out when Lucy 's grand announcement of a housework strike ( " We 're revolting ! " ) backfired , forcing the pair to forsake modern appliances ? Hey , no one said best-friendship would be easy . Mary &; Rhoda A friend with lifelong potential has got to be able to tell you what 's what-even when you do n't want to hear it . That 's how it was between those classic TV opposites on The Mary Tyler Moore Show : the ambitious but vulnerable career girl , Mary Richards , and her somewhat clunkier upstairs neighbor , Rhoda Morgenstern . Sure , Rhoda could be pushy with Mary-as in , " Could you lend me your dress , your shoes ... your body ? " But when it came to Sidebar helping her friend , she was all heart ( and mouth ) . For example , rather than let her domestically challenged pal embarrass herself by hosting a dinner party for a visiting congresswoman , Rhoda discreetly suggested that Mary take her guest to one of the many nice restaurants in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave it to her straight : " But , Mary ... you know about your pahhdies .

None of that shakes a good friend 's confidence in you . Or so say Laverne and Shirley , TV 's wisecracking brewery workers who were endlessly supportive of each other . Consider Laverne 's bons mots after Shirley 's plan to snag two eligible bachelors left the pair stranded in an Oshkosh , WI , bus station , with crushed hopes for a double wedding : " You ca n't stop dreaming , Shirl . " " Sniff . Why not ? Sniff . " " Just think-if one of your cockamamy dreams comes true , we 're home free .

Kate &; Allie She always remembers your birthday . The time you locked yourself out in your rattiest pajamas . If you like sugar in your coffee and suspenders on men . The farther back you go , the more she has on you .
