<p> ' WE did n't know how we were going to do it ! Everybody was surprised when it was really , finally done . It 's beautiful . So many hands ... have gone into it . " Brij Gandhi , a member of the strong Asian community of Glasgow , Scotland , speaks with great appreciation . " I think the credit goes to the women who finished it off . " In fact , a fair bit of the credit goes to Mrs. Gandhi . <p> The hand-embroidered panel - " February " - which she is talking about was made a year ago by a multicultural group of women and girls . These volunteers came from the city of Paisley , about 7 miles west of Glasgow , and from the Indian and Pakistani population of Glasgow . <p> Mrs. Gandhi was asked by " Needleworks Enterprises , " the organizers of this 12-panel project , to invite Asian women to take part in its making . They came - in some cases shyly - and greatly enjoyed it . In fact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two Argentinians , and a Brazilian . Also , some Asian school children worked on it and mothers came with their young children . Even some six-year-olds were given the chance to contribute . Since they could n't yet sew , they were provided with beads and glue instead of needles and thread . <p> Some people just came once and helped , but most , once they 'd started , could n't stay away . Although the work took place ( every Thursday and Friday throughout February 1990 ) in full public view at the main Glasgow Museum and Art Gallery , some women worked on separate parts of the panel at home . It was a true community project , a sharing of stories and skills . One participant thought it was like " the old sewing bees " that were once common . " People told you their life history ! " There was a sense of reviving old methods , of remembering . <p> This is confirmed by Susan Green , coordinator for the entire project ( called " Keeping Glasgow in Stitches " ) , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved over 500 people . She describes how " people came and said , ' Oh , I used to do that ! " ' Ms. Green delighted in the " wee Glasgow women coming in - they can do such amazing things . " Some had n't done embroidery for years ; others " sit and knit and crochet all the time anyway , " so the panel was an exciting extension of their normal activity . The enthusiasm generated by the " February " panel in particular was remarkable . <p> It was intended from early on to be a multicultural project . Women from Paisley were asked to take part because the classic design known as the paisley pattern comes from their city . But the origins of the pattern , with its characteristic motif - some call it a " teardrop , " the " pine motif , " or the " pear " - comes , says Irene Woods , one of the Paisley contingent , " from India originally . It traces back to all sorts of ancient origins . " <p> So the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that the ancient yang and yin ( symbol of male and female ) - " the symbol of perfect balance " - appears to be composed of two such paisley motifs conjoined . " It 's black and white , white with a wee touch of black , black with a wee touch of white . " And so this symbol - sewn by Mrs. Woods - was placed right in the middle of the panel , poised like an unlikely monochrome egg in a wonderfully ropy and colorful nest at the exact top of the tree . <p> It is this tree which is the basic design for the 15-foot panel . From its branches are suspended a gorgeous array of paisley motifs worked with great inventiveness and variety , which are meant to be leaves . It was in these " leaves " that the overenthusiasm ran special riot : Far too many were made . But rather than waste them , a further panel has since been made that incorporated many more than the February panel could . <p> To Mrs. Gandhi 's band of Indian and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is a very common one . We love flowers , and mango-type of patterns ... We like very bright colors . " The European women I spoke to remarked on it : Here were combinations of turquoise and vivid pink , shiny royal blue , and sinuous bands of fierce orange running parallel to hard strong reds . To the Scottish Irene Woods such colors together seem , at first , " gaudy " perhaps . But since working on the panel she confesses she has bought a couple of Indian waistcoats in a gallery in Edinburgh . " One of them is so absolutely beautiful , " she says . <p> " Sisha " mirrors featured in the February panel . Some of the Asian women taught the others the difficult and laborious technique involved in securing these little mirrors into the embroidery . " It looks straightforward , " Mrs. Woods says , " but it 's not . You 've got to ... hold the mirror down with your thread and gradually build up - it 's almost like a spider 's web - round the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is caught down , a crisscross round the edges until it 's secure . " Sequins , also much in evidence in the panel , have a hole through them for the thread : much easier . <p> The central tree dominating the panel is meant to represent the " Tree of Life " - again somehow connected with the origins of the paisley pattern , and again a symbol with significance in many different cultures and religions . Making the panel meant a path-crossing of people with different religions . <p> Irene Woods is one of a group who had already made an embroidered panel for its ( Church of Scotland ) church in Paisley , Castlehead Church . Her interest in the project was sparked by an encounter with Clare Higney , head of " Needleworks " and whose idea the project was . She recalls the excitement of starting work on the panel - after much discussion and planning . There was a " mass of materials : scraps , fabrics , threads , and trimming - fabulous ! Wonderful to rummage in , some of it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color goes with that - and then you were off ! " <p> The 12 panels of the project are designed to hang in order , and the patchwork background colors have been carefully arranged so that there is a consistent merging of one panel into the next . These colors were partly dictated by the time of year they symbolize . So the February background is predominantly made up of dull , dark greens . This proved an ideal way of setting off the brilliant , often shiny and iridescent , embroidery imposed on it . The color that sticks out in this rainbow display is a vivid violet . <p> The panel 's basic design was deliberately uncomplicated . " A simple bold design , " says Lorraine Davin , the professional embroiderer and weaver who oversaw its making , " allowing for lots of small detail . " <p> In the tree 's roots flourish a delightful community of insects , beetles , flies , a worm , and flying around the trunk , a bee and a dragonfly . The most exotic birds imaginable perch ( more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while a gossamer dove of peace soars above everything . A horizontal piece of weaving was specially made by a professional , Sarah Sumsion , to represent the river . It is an Ikat weave , a kind of tie-dye technique , permitting a subtle merging of colors . <p> One woman from Paisley modeled a sewn collage after her photographs of the city 's skyline , creating a kind of layered effect of materials depicting towers , spires , and roofs . Some machine stitching was used to stop fraying edges , but almost all of the panel is hand-sewn or hand-embroidered . <p> The upper regions of all 12 panels made for the project were done by a core group organized throughout the year by Malcolm Lochhead , the chief designer . He is elated by the way the project has revived a community sense of craftsmanship . And certainly this Monday group has brought about firm and lasting friendships . It is they who undertook the finishing - the bringing together - of the panel so praised by Mrs. Gandhi . <p> The tree is on a 7-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It includes the large letter " L " ( the panels together spell out " GLASGOW 1990 " ) and a depiction of Glasgow Cathedral , with the city 's largest mosque , and a star of David . " The top of the panel , " reads the wall label at the Glasgow Museum and Art Gallery , where the panels are currently on exhibition , " represents the spiritual origin of the city and its principal religions . " <p> This top space also sports the words " The Clyde made Glasgow and ... " The March panel - on the subject " The Spirit of the Community " - finishes the sentence . It reads : " Glasgow made the Clyde . " It is the River Clyde that not only runs through the city , but also runs symbolically through the 12 panels of the " Keeping Glasgow in Stitches " project , binding them together . A book is promised on the project , presumably going into detail about the amazing degree of commitment and downright invention that went into its completion .
