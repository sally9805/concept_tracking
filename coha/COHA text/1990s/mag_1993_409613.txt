It was the biggest thing to happen in Marion , Ind. , since the high school basketball team won back-to-back state championships in the mid- ' ' 70s . People in the rural town of 32,000 expect to see a church bustling with activity on a Sunday morning  --  but by noon on June 27 , it became apparent that something was brewing at St. James Lutheran Church , and , as one resident said , " this was n't just a typical small-town wedding . " Five tour buses and three stretch limos pulled up near the Grant County Courthouse . When the doors opened , such celebrities as Susan Sarandon and her longtime mate , Tim Robbins , stepped out . Sarandon would say later that " we were all coming in from everywhere , like Noah 's ark . " Maybe , but the bride and groom were each definitely one of a kind . Karen Bostic Weaver , the Grant County court clerk in Marion , will long remember going into the lead bus to get the marriage license signed . Sitting right there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been compared , favorably , to a " thatch of nuclear-radiatted alfalfa sprouts . " And next to him ? A more-than-pretty woman with cascading tawny curls , chestnut brown eyes and a blinding smile . " Are you the real Julia Roberts ? " Weaver asked . After she got a polite " Yes " from the actress  --  along with the required proof that Roberts , besides being beautiful and talented , had also been immunized against German measles  --  Weaver went back into the world with the news that the newlyweds-in-waiting were truly " nice people . I was very impressed but not awestruck , " she said later . " I was awestruck when I met Dan Quayle . " The rest of the world merely felt like Quayle in his first clueless days as a vice presidential candidate . From Klein , Tex . ( where Lovett was raised and still parks his black pickup truck ) , to Vienna , Austria ( where former Roberts fiance Kiefer Sutherland was filming The Three Musketeers ) , people reacted to the news of the wedding  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town that happened to fall conveniently between stops on Lovett 's summer concert tour  --  with a collective and disbelieving ... HUH ! ? Could it be that Roberts , after a history of romances with actors , was , at 25 , really settling down with the self-effacing 35-year-old composer of such darkly humorous love meditations as " She 's Leaving Me Because She Really Wants To " and " Once Is Enough " ( " I used to be so much more open-minded/I used to like to fall in love/And they tell me I was so much sweeter and kinder/But once is enough " ) ? Just as when Mount St. Helens erupted and the Soviet Union collapsed , people came forward with theories . " I think Julia 's tired of the Hollywood pretense , " said country star Tanya Tucker , a friend of Lyle 's . " Maybe she 's ready to be treated like a goddess , the way Lyle will . " Susan Sarandon 's younger brother Terry Tomalin , a sportswriter for Florida 's St. Petersburg Times who was summoned from a fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusion to Julia 's Smyrna , Ga. , roots ) that the marriage was " a private matter between a consummate Southern gentleman and a consummate Southern belle . " And Memphis concert promoter Bob Kelley , noting that both Lovett and Roberts are long and lanky , said , " Well , tall people like tall people , I guess . " But it was Don Ganter , owner of the Dixie Chicken in College Station , Tex. , where Lovett earned a journalism degree from Texas A &M; University in 1980 , who spoke for most folks . Ganter remembers the singer as a " skinny kid , bashful and sensitive . " When he heard about the wedding , Ganter said , " I felt like I was standing in the street and had a semi truck run over me . " The truth is , Lovett and Roberts have been traveling full tilt down love 's highway . The conventional wisdom is that they met during the filming of The Player , a star-studded 1992 spoof of the movie business in which they both played cameo parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Lovett 's sweetheart for three years  --  say that Lyle and Julia never hooked up in Hollywood , since they shot their scenes on different days . " Lyle and I were looking forward to seeing her , we were like stargazing , " says Inman . " But we were gone the day she shot her scene . " No , it seems that the newlyweds had been seeing each other seriously for a grand total of three or four weeks  --  or about as long as it might take Lovett , an extremely meticulous man who has a reputation for being a kind of Seinfeld of the Sunbelt , to pick out a necktie . " I 'm proud of the old guy , because I 've never seen him do anything spontaneous , " says Inman . " I have to applaud a woman who can get him to do something like that . " She and Lyle broke up earlier this year , Inman says , partly because , despite their best efforts , they could n't quite reconcile their very different lives . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " I could n't handle everything that went along with it . So it 's good for him and Julia to find each other , to have somebody who understands . Lyle must be beside himself . I really want him to be happy , because he 's a wonderful person . " But if the courtship was n't conventional , the wedding , in most ways , was . With Julia 's mother , Betty Motes , an acting teacher still living in Georgia , ensconced pertly in the second pew , the ceremony started promptly at 3 on a steamy afternoon . Julia 's maid of honor was her sister , Lisa , 27 , an actress , who flew in from New York City . ( Roberts 's father , Walter , died when she was 10 ; the only key family member missing was Julia 's actor brother , Eric . ) The bride , who was on weekend leave from filming The Pelican Brief in Washington , D.C. , had five attendants , including Sarandon and other close friends . Dressed eclectically in whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marched down the aisle of the sparsely furnished church to the organ strains of Bach 's " Jesu , Joy of Man 's Desiring . " Then the cellist segued stirringly into the " Wedding March , " and Julia  --  preceded by two flower girls  --  entered on the arm of her longtime friend , actor Barry Tubb , 30 , carrying white roses . She wore a simple , unadorned white dress ( size small ) by Commes des Garcons that Lovett himself had bought for a reported $2,000 , and a floor-length tulle scarf . " She looked gorgeous , " says Deborah Goodrich Porter , an actress friend of Roberts 's who served as a bridesmaid . Some guests were surprised by the simplicity of her dress . " It looked more like a slip that should go under a wedding dress , " said one of Lyle 's relatives , who had flown up in one of the chartered jets the singer sent for his parents , William and Bernell , who are retired Exxon employees , and some 16 other family members . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see her toes too : The bride , in what friends immediately recognized as a most Julia-esque fashion fillip , was barefoot . Lovett , for his part , wore the classic dark suit and dazed expression as he stood at the altar , not far from where an American flag hung motionless , and waited for his betrothed . Some of his friends looked even more shocked . One college pal , Robert Earl Keen Jr. , said he came home to find a phone message from Lovett that said , " I 've met this great gal , and I 'm getting married to her tomorrow , and I hope you can make it . " In the end , Keen could n't . But Lovett 's childhood minister , Pastor DeWyth Beltz from Klein 's Trinity Lutheran Church , was there , and he conducted the 20-minute ceremony in conjunction with St. James 's pastor , the Rev. Mark Carlson . After the bride and groom kissed , backup vocalist Francine Reed of Lovett 's Large Band sang " The Lord 's Prayer " a cappella from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band had a gig that night in Nobelsville , Ind. , 60 miles to the south , the newlyweds and their guests boarded the tour buses . Talk about your summer romances : Here it was not even the Fourth of July yet , and Roberts was married to someone she had n't even been dating on Memorial Day weekend . How did things come so far so fast ? That question is still being sorted out by all 75 or so people who were in the church , including Roberts and Lovett . " I 'm afraid I 'm going to wake up , " Julia told a friend soon after the ceremony , " and this will all be just a dream . " Like other Great Moments in Harmony , the Lovett-Roberts romance seems to have started in New Orleans . The couple were first spotted together there on June 8 , midway through The Pelican Brief 's monthlong shoot in that city . They were spotted at Cafe Brasil , where they had gone to hear the New Orleans Klezmer All-Stars , an acoustic band that specializes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this means that , as they go through life , Lyle and Julia will seldom get the chance to look at each other knowingly and say , " Darling , they 're playing our song ! " On the other hand , they did dance a mean hora . " They were nuzzling and dancing together , " recalls one customer . " Everyone knew something special was happening between them . " The couple certainly got caught up in each other 's lives . She was backstage when he played Memphis ; Vienna , W.Va. ; and New York City . He visited her on the Pelican set in New Orleans . A couple of weeks ago , Julia started calling Lyle 's mom just to chat . " When I 'm not singing , " Lyle told a cousin , " I 'm talking to Julia . " And even when he was singing  --  about hats or heartbreak  --  " His songs , " says a band member , " suddenly took on different meaning . " Like many couples , Lyle and Julia developed a secret code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Roberts 's middle name ) or to his " very special friend . " " Fiona likes to think I wrote this song for her , " said Lovett from the stage of New York 's Paramount theater , before breaking into " She Makes Me Feel Good " ( " She 's got big red lips/ She 's got big brown eyes/ When she treats me right/ It 's a big surprise " ) . It was n't till he had moved along to the next town , though , that the New York press figured out that the mysterious cross-dressing woman who had introduced " Stand By Your Man " ( which Lovett also performed for the movie The Crying Game ) was none other than Julia Roberts . What she could n't disguise  --  or even contain  --  was her happiness . " What I really liked about her , " says Trish Shuman , media director for West Virginia 's Wolf Trap Farm Park theater , where Lovett performed June 20 , " is how animated she became during the set . At the end she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much she had enjoyed the show . " During a press conference in Washington for Pelican , when a reporter asked if she felt rusty after not taking on a major role in two years , Roberts retorted , " I do n't feel rusty . Do I look rusty ? " What she looked , as she knew as well as everyone else in that room , was spectacular , her hair grown back to its Pretty Woman curls , her beige linen pantsuit showing off the glow of her flawless complexion . " Actually , " she continued , " I think I came back with some renewed vigor .... I 've been giddy . " That Lyle Lovett was the source of Julia Roberts 's giddiness was probably as much a surprise to his fans as hers . Sure , she had been romantically involved with a number of intense , often hunky actors , including Liam Neeson , Jason Patric , Kiefer Sutherland and , reportedly , Daniel Day-Lewis . Lovett , with his slightly off-center charm , was a clear departure from type . Lyle had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a witty melancholy interspersed with moments of irrational hope . In " I Married Her Just Because She Looks Like You , " the narrator does just that ; in " She 's No Lady , " Lovett sings , " The preacher asked her/ And she said , " I do . ' ' / The preacher asked me/ And she said , " Yes , he does , too . ' ' / And the preacher said , / " I pronounce you 99-to-life. / Son , she 's no lady , she 's your wife . ' ' " On his latest album , Joshua Judges Ruth , Lovett is the victim of unrequited love in no fewer than five songs . Lyle 's appeal to women may fall into the category of things that some men just do n't get . He is not conventionally studly . Yet Mary-Chapin Carpenter won a Grammy for putting to music her fantasy about the singer ; she croons in " I Feel Lucky " that " Lyle Lovett 's right beside me with his hand upon my thigh . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a sex idol , Lovett responded , " ' No " would be an understatement , but no . ' ' " But that 's precisely the source of his appeal . Says Sandy Lovejoy , a reporter on Phoenix radio station WNIX who has known Lovett for years : " What women look for in a man he 's got in spades . He 's sweet , kind and gentle and really a catch . And I bet you he 'd do anything to make a woman happy . Anything . " In an interview earlier this year , Lovett revealed that , for all his skeptical lyrics about relationships and marriage , he had both respect and longing for the institution . " I think anything that 's worth thinking about and spending your life on is a matter of life and death , " he said . " True love is a matter of life and death . " Family , too , clearly has a hold on him . The only child of a couple who have been married for 37 years , Lovett lives in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Klein is named for his great-great-grandfather ) and less than a half mile from nearly a dozen aunts , uncles and cousins . " When I got up there , " Lyle 's uncle Calvin Klein says of the wedding , " I figured as famous as she was and he , that we 'd just be a little number passing by . But Julia was exceptionally warm , and Lyle has always been that way , just first-class . " Roberts 's childhood was , in contrast , marked by loss . Her parents separated when she was 3 years old . Her brother , Eric , went to live with their father , a local theater director , while she and her older sister , Lisa , stayed with their mother . Seven years later her father died . Although she and Eric have career in common , the two have had little contact since clashing over Eric 's contentious breakup with his longtime girlfriend Kelly Cunningham two years ago . Still , Julia and Lovett share the same small-town background  --  and big-time success . He earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has a Golden Globe award for Steel Magnolias and Academy Award nominations for both that movie and Pretty Woman . And yet they are in no way competitive , a problem that may have played a role in Julia 's relationships with other actors . While Lovett has a small part in Player director Robert Altman 's next movie , Short Cuts , based on a series of Raymond Carver short stories , he has said he does n't want an acting career . Nor has Roberts , her portrayal of a rock guitarist in 1988 's Satisfaction notwithstanding , shown real interest in music . While there was no dancing at the couple 's wedding reception , held in a white tent outside the Deer Park Music Center , Roberts gladly tossed her bouquet to the female guests ( it was caught by her agent , Elaine Goldsmith ) and cheerfully hammed it up when Lovett got down on his knees to remove her pale-blue garter . " He makes me so happy , " Julia said . " He 's so good to me . " While there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Roberts returned to the Washington set of The Pelican Brief . There she was greeted by a crew member dressed as Cupid and carrying a bow and arrow . In the first scene shot that day , Roberts was supposed to be talking to actor John Heard on the phone . But director Alan Pakula arranged for Lovett to phone from Ohio and read Heard 's lines . Roberts , recognizing Lovett 's voice immediately , finished the scene , and , after the cut , turned to Pakula and said proudly , " That 's my husband . " And at the party thrown for Roberts later that day , costar Denzel Washington , along with cast and crew members , sported T-shirts that read , on the front , " Welcome Back , Mrs. Lovett " , and on the back , " He 's A Lovely Boy ... But You Really Must Do Something About His Hair . " Who knows , Lovett might just change that trademark coiffure . At his wedding-night concert , after all , fans saw a different Lyle . For starters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the song " Stand By Your Man " in front of 10,000 cheering fans . Then he stood onstage and gave her a long , passionate kiss as the crowd went wild and word of their marriage spread from row to row . Finally , overwhelmed , he did the unthinkable : Lyle Lovett threw irony to the wind and engaged in a blatant , unapologetic , public display of sincerity . " Thank you very much , " he told the audience . " And welcome to the happiest day of my life . " <p>
