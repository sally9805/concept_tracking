Early on the morning of Alice 's wedding , when I was nine , I woke to hear the front door slamming into the quiet , and I got out of my bed and went to the window . Standing on tiptoes , feet bare against floor planks chilled by the air conditioner , the breeze running up my nightgown , I held open a crack in the Venetian blinds and peered through to see my father stepping down the front porch stairs . In one hand he held The Clarion Leger , still in its rubber bands , and with the other he clutched at the banister on account of the polio I knew he 'd had as a child : under his trousers one leg was forever crooked , just slightly . He wore a coat and tie , as if he were going to work down at the insurance office , but it was Saturday . It was odd to me that he would be leaving then , only a few hours before the wedding at noon , ambling with a vague limp along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin Avenue . <p> Just then , I heard the front door again , and my mother rushed onto the porch after him , the hair she 'd had done the day before tied up in a scarf and her jewel-toned caftan billowing . From the angle of my room , I could see her calling to him from the top of the stairs , her chin imploring and forward . I could hear nothing , though , could only see him glance back and mouth a word or two  --  perhaps her name , " Maybelle "  --  close the gate behind him , and continue down the sidewalk toward town . For a little while , my mother waited on the porch , arranging the folds of her caftan and looking after him forlornly , as if she thought he 'd come back , but he did n't , and suddenly she flew inside again , as quickly as she had come out . Yet I stood still , and watched him growing smaller in the distance as Franklin Avenue bore downhill toward the courthouse and downtown , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hydrangea bushes that were bursting forth in clusters of blue and pink blooms . At the bottom of the hill , my father would go to his office , I was sure , and I tried to imagine him behind his desk at the insurance agency on a Saturday , on this Saturday of Saturdays , when Alice was a bride and I was a bridesmaid . I could form a picture of him sitting in the dark there , with the glowing red sign , Car  --  Home  --  Health-Life , blinking long shadows through the picture window onto the linoleum , and I held that scene in my mind until he disappeared from view , then scuttled out into the hall . <p> Stillness lay thick over the house , except for tiny voices from the television in the kitchen and the floorboards which creaked as I shuffled down the dark hall , pushing open all the closed doors to see who was about , and finding no one . Not Gill , Alice 's fiance from out in the county . I had n't seen him since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he came to dinner and sat confounded and awkward at the table , twisting his long , stringy ponytail in hand and mumbling " yes 'm , " and " no sir " to all questions . I did not much care for him . <p> But where was everybody else , I wanted to know , where were all the Memphis cousins who were supposed to be arriving ? The year before , one of them had gotten married , one of the Rands , my mother 's family . We had all gone up to Memphis , my parents , my brother , Rand , Alice , and I to see her in stiff white satin at the Second Presbyterian Church . At the reception CiCi ran about the country club with her husband carrying her train , exclaiming , " I 'm so happy , y'all ! " and taking tiny sips of champagne out of glasses passed on trays by waiters . I had thought it brilliant , sneaking round the hundreds of guests and stealing four rice bags wrapped in tulle and ribbon which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way back down toward home . My cousin had eight attendants who had worn wide-brimmed hats and carried nosegay carnations , which , abandoned on the tables at the reception , I had picked up and admired . " Now you will have one just like them , " Mama had assured me over and over ; it would match my bridesmaid 's dress from Peter Fran 's in Jackson that was waiting in plastic . How many bouquets would be in the refrigerator ? When would all the raucous day begin ? <p> Light from the dining room chandelier burned down the hall , and I walked into it to find my mother settled now at the head of the long table , bent over addressing announcements . She did not see me , and I could see her teeth chewing upon her lower lip as she dashed off an address in her fine longhand , and put the finished envelope on the tottering pile before her . Announcements had to be sent the day of the wedding , she had explained , to all the people who wouldn't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she had read out to me the section on them in the new edition of Emily Post she had bought on the day after we all found out Alice was getting married . " Mama , " I braved the silence , " why come Daddy left ? " <p> She seemed not to hear me , but instead ran a finger from a page of her tapestry address book to a name she was copying out on another envelope . My mother had a tendency to ignore questions that she did not think were appropriate for children to ask , and her children were always asking such questions . I stepped farther into the room and spoke again , this time asking , " Mama ? Where 're Alice and Rand ? " <p> Again she did n't answer , only looked up , softening her face , and said , " Hallie . " She stretched out her arms and drew me into the lap I knew I was too big to sit on anymore . At first I felt comforted , and clutched her around the neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel right and filled me with unease . I could see in Mama 's face how tired she was ; she looked pale and veined and she had n't put on her big eyelashes yet . Her arm was around me tightly . Once again , I tried starting over , " Well , where are all of them ? " <p> Writing out an address , she did not look at me but replied with finality , " Daddy had to go to work for a little while ; Alice is still asleep and then , unsure , " Rand is ... out somewhere . " <p> " Then when are the cousins going to get here ? " I was getting impatient . <p> " You know I told you yesterday that they were going to meet us at the church , be easier that way , " she sighed over the satiny white box of announcements , then silenced me , " Now just wait on me for a little while and I 'll help you get ready . " <p> I fidgeted and caught at one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our address embossed on the back , and the second one with its square of tissue beneath it , running my fingers over the engraving and reading : <p> Mr. and Mrs. William Exum East <p> have the honour to announce <p> the marriage of their daughter <p> Alice Honora <p> to <p> Mr. Gill Thrasher <p> Saturday , the ninth of June <p> nineteen-hundred and seventy-three <p> First Presbyterian Church <p> Anathoth , Mississippi <p> Then I looked around the dining room to see what Mama had done to it , for it had been off-limits all week . The reception was going to be in here , afterwards , with the table set up as a buffet , because the country club had been booked . Every last leaf had been added , and she had draped the table with her best damask linen cloth , but now this morning all was disorder : the stacks of announcements spilled haphazardly around the three-tier cake . On the sideboard she had stacked silverware brought home from the bank vault , next to the great punch bowl , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fifths of rum stuffed in its hold for the planter 's punch . My parents rarely drank , and so my mother had been excited about it , pulling out the recipe their cook had used when she was little . Mama had also set up card tables draped with lawn along the walls , which displayed the presents Alice had received ; there were only a few , for in the short time , Alice had registered neither china pattern nor flatware . And through the open swinging door that led into the kitchen , I could see Vera  --  the maid who had raised Alice and Rand but by my time had retired to the new convalescent home on the edge of town  --  wearing the uniform she only wore for special occasions . She was standing at the counter arranging deviled eggs in circles on a tray , one eye on the small black and white television perched on the counter , which resounded loud and hollow through the room . She was older than I could imagine , but watching a dance show broadcast from Jackson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tray , she stepped shakily into the dining room and set it on the table edge , saying , " Here you go , Mrs. East , " before she disappeared into the kitchen and the door swung shut behind her . <p> Every night my family had dinner at the table , my mother bringing our plates in full from the kitchen , and it was here that two things had happened . The first had been six months before , in the gray lull between Christmas and New Year 's , when Alice had sat down one night in her usual chair next to the sideboard and announced , right after the blessing , " I do n't think I want to go back to school this semester , after all . " She smiled apologetically as she said it , as if she knew nothing could be more unexpected than this , and pushed a loose strand of blond hair out of her face . For a moment , everyone sat tense and glazed until Rand remarked shortly , " Well , where 're you going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orderly code of rules about what was and was not proper . <p> And Alice had replied , too easily , " I think I 'm going to come home and live for a little while . " <p> Diagonally across the table , my mother blanched and asked , " Is there something wrong , sweetheart ? " worrying a napkin ring with her fingers . Alice shook her head slightly , as if only for her to see , and Mama visibly quieted . " AU right , then , " she pronounced . My father only looked sad ; he was the first person in his family to graduate from college , and had all our lives told us if you did n't finish young , you did n't finish at all . <p> But when I thought about Alice back in town , I only felt horrified : In my mind the greatness of her senior year in high school , last year , suddenly crumpled in on itself ; I blurted out , " You cai n't ! You cai n't come back here ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shh , shh , calm down now . " People who had never amounted to much could stay in Anathoth without going to college , girls typing in the offices on Attorneys ' Row and boys doing shifts up at the plant or the cotton compress . They were all around , but invisible . My sister , Alice , however , had shone , and was meant to carry her brilliance far before she brought it back to Franklin Avenue again , I thought . Her senior year at the Academy , she had sat in the back of a showroom Cadillac convertible as it wound around the edge of a new football field eked out of an acre of cotton land ; it was halftime and she was grinning in my mother 's mink stole , carrying a sheaf of roses and wearing a ribbon over her shoulder that spelled out , in glitter , " Demeter . " She had been crowned queen of the Harvest Festival , and sat on a dais adorned with fruits and vegetables and cotton , her hair like corn silk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending over and saying , " These are for you , Hallie , " and I had glowed . Then after the game she had gone off to a party , and out of the window of the car , I had seen her sailing across the school parking lot with her tiara in hand and holding up the skirt of her brocaded silver dress that was luminous under the streetlights . Mama caught sight of her then , and murmured into the dark well of the Impala , " Is n't she beautiful ? " Peering over the top of the back seat , I had seen her give my father a look I do n't think I ever saw again , a look completely open and full of pure gratitude . It was only the second class to be graduated from the colonnaded Academy that rose up brick-new on the road to Vicksburg , and here she walked with the authority of an empress . <p> Then she was graduated and went up to Oxford like my mother and father many years before , where she pledged the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had called home and described-for Mama the parties to which she had been , which houses she had liked and who she had met , as I listened in on the extension . " This boy is pouring champagne for me and I 've never been so happy , " she crowed to her on Bid Day , speaking of unfathomable knowledge I would have to wait to know . <p> But then something happened . All fall after that , whenever the phone rang , I ran into the hall from my television program to answer it , but only rarely was it Alice . As the months progressed , she had less and less to say , and there came into her voice an impatient edge : she was just fine , there were more parties than ever , could she speak to Mama , and was I behaving , anyway ? <p> But in January , Alice did stay home , after the letter from the sorority arrived de-pledging her for such a low average , and a note from the housemother of the dormitory expressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After I heard my parents whispering about the letter , I found it in my mother 's secretary and read it , but could not relate it to the sister I knew : There had been evenings when she disappeared for hours and had to be let in the door by campus security in the small hours of the morning , and she had been visited by boys " who did not appear to attend the University . " <p> " Now what do you suppose that means ? " I heard my mother say to Daddy one evening . Nights , they sat in bed and read , the light from the nightstand shining down through the open door into my room ; they were reading the letter again , I knew , but my father never answered her . It , like everything else , was passed over in perfect silence . <p> So the next Saturday , my parents hauled her belongings back from Oxford in Daddy 's truck , and she took a job at the public library next to the courthouse , where there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all day long , reading magazines or propping her elbows on the counter and staring out the Palladian windows onto Main Street . A couple of times , I dropped by there with Mama to visit , and one day Alice was not at her post . " She always takes too long a break , Miz East , " the librarian , Miss Eloise , complained . <p> " It 's cause that job is a drag Alice replied when my mother timidly confronted her , but she kept on working . As winter passed she began to seem withdrawn , curiously dulled . She began to wear clothes I had not before seen , Empire dresses that trailed the floor and brown leather sandals with bells that jingled as she walked , wandering about the house aimlessly as if she were imprisoned , and smoking cigarettes at the kitchen table against Mama 's raised brow . Sometimes after dinner she would escape in the Impala , and in the morning when my mother drove me to school , the car would smell of lake water . Rand was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were parties , out on the levee , crowds of wild people camping against the dusk . These were the hippie rednecks with long hair who also hung out in the parking lot of the Big Barn Minit Mart that people said smoked drugs . <p> " You would n't believe who I 've heard goes out there , " he told Mama one day after school when they were watching Somerset in the sitting room , after he had told me to go away and I had lingered on the other side of the door . " Which ones of your friends ' children , " he added , but then she turned up the volume . <p> Often that spring my mother had Junior Auxiliary meetings , and Alice picked me up from fourth grade . One day close to Easter , when red buds were beginning to bloom , Alice drove up to the Academy with all four windows down , humming to herself , and when I got in the front and tossed my books into the back seat , she turned and said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , okay ? " She was barefooted and pressed her toes against the gas pedal , steering the wheel in the flat palms of her hands , and the wind blowing through the car smelled of sweet olive . She drove through town , climbing into the hills under trees hung with kudzu , heading for the fertilizer plant that burst forth at the top , overlooking all the delta . Silvery smokestacks thrust against the sky pouring white smoke and yellow sulfur . In the middle , an aluminum tower rose for a dozen stories , laced with pipes and threaded with stairs . A cooling tower , Daddy had once told me . Getting out , Alice went toward it , shouting up , " I 'm here , come on ! " <p> High on a catwalk was a man , with a blond ponytail sticking out of his hard hat , who leaned out over a rail . " Hang on jus ' <p> minute , Alice ! " he called out , and when I heard his unfamiliar voice speak her name , I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming down ; his footsteps rang on the metal staircase rungs . Then he emerged from the entrance , with his hard hat in one hand , and with the other he suddenly clasped her on the shoulder . <p> " Get in the back , Hallie , please ? " she asked , and they got in the car and slammed the doors . " Oh , this is Gill , " she said as she backed out onto the road . <p> He turned and gave me a look that was too immediately friendly , what my mother would call " familiar , " and I mumbled hello . <p> " Guess your sister do n't want to talk to me none , " he said , and turned back around . Coming down from the hills , Alice took the bypass that rounded town toward the delta and then went over the river bridge . <p> " We 're going to take Gill home . His car is broken , " she explained , and turned on the FM rock station from Jackson . On the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road that meandered along the levee , past a country store or two and a rusty , long-defunct gin . Then she pulled off onto a gravel driveway that ran in a long straight line back to a tiny frame house and a single cottonwood tree , where she cut the motor . <p> " Y'all'gn come in a while , " he said , and I followed behind them with arms crossed as they went inside through the unlocked door . The house was filled with gray , empty light because there were no curtains on any of the windows except one , over which was tacked an old bedspread . " Y'all sit down , " he said , and Alice smiled at him , but there was hardly any furniture , only an armchair placed directly in front of a television set into which Alice plopped , a couple of side tables , and a chair that looked as if it were part of a dinette set which I did n't want to sit in because it looked dirty . <p> " You want a Coke ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I answered no . Then he came back in bearing two beers , one of which he gave to Alice , who did not , I noticed , ask for <p> glass . You were always supposed to ask for a glass . <p> He saw that I was still standing . " She do n't want to sit down , eh ? " <p> " Oh , Hallie , " Alice said dismissively . My sister was transforming before my eyes ; she had already metamorphosed into something different than the dreamy princess who moped around our house on Franklin Avenue . Now she was serenely expectant , leaning back languidly in the armchair so that her short sundress came above her knees . The sweat from the beer can was running down her fingers in rivulets , and she was looking up at him . " Well , now , " she pronounced . I sensed that they were waiting for something , and acquiesced , sitting down in the kitchen chair with my feet dangling stupidly above the floor . <p> He picked up a strange pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something down in it with an index finger , then lit a sparking lighter to it and inhaled . Do n't burn yourself , I thought , or maybe you should . Then Alice took the pipe from him and also inhaled as the scent like incense curled again into the room . Bewildered , I stared at an unplugged electric guitar leaning idle against an amplifier , whose silver logo I began to spell out to myself , trying to tune everything else out : Fender . <p> He saw me looking at it , picked up the guitar , and ran his fingers along the strings so that they made soft faint twangs . All of <p> sudden , he got down in my face , leaning toward me with the guitar in his arms , and said , " Are n't you going to smile at me ? " At first I felt embarrassed , then stole a glance at him and saw he had the clearest green eyes , and for an instant before he turned away , I allowed myself to realize they were beautiful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence , and got up from the chair . " We better go . " <p> " I talk to you , " he called from the open doorway as we walked back out to the car . " Thanks for the ride . " All the way home , Alice said nothing , she had not even asked me not to tell , but I never would , anyhow , because no one would believe . <p> That afternoon became like an illusion , half-forgotten , and I had not thought of him at all until two weeks before , on a day that Alice came home late from the library . This was the second thing that had happened at the dining room table . Mama had entrusted me with collecting plates and Rand was asking could he be excused when Alice appeared in the doorway , her long , pale hands clasping the door jamb . For a second she stood very still , then announced , " Mama , Daddy , I 'm going to get married to Gill Thrasher . " He was coming over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , that house and those green eyes , came crashing into my mind , and I yelled out , " Hunh ? Hunh ? " until I fell quiet when I heard my father 's tone , " Be quiet , Hallie . " <p> " Who Thrasher ? " Daddy demanded , turning around in the chair at his end of the table to face her , while Mama clattered <p> spoon through her coffee . <p> There were a thousand Thrashers that farmed on parts and parcels of rented land , and he was one of them . " Gill Thrasher , " Alice repeated hopefully , coloring , " from out in the county . He works at Chemical . I knew him , " she paused for a second , " when I still went to the public schools . " <p> Flushing red , Daddy glared wordless at her until my mother finally waved Rand and me out of the dining room and slid shut the heavy rosewood doors against us . We waited , not saying anything , sitting on the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the quiet , I heard through the doors an awful , strangulated sound . It was my father crying . Then I could hear my father asking her questions , questions that began with her name , Alice , and trailed off , inaudible . Her voice would answer , a constant soft murmur , and I heard the clink of china , Mama sitting there nervously arranging the plates I had not finished stacking . When the doors reopened , Mama emerged briskly , and I could see my father stroking Alice 's hand with his own , imploring , " You do n't want another sin before God , do you ? You think you can live with this Thrasher for the rest of your life in some shack back on a field ? " then leaned close to her and whispered so I could barely hear , " Ca n't I just take you away for a while ? " <p> " Daddy , really , " she said impatiently , rising to follow my mother into the hall . She stopped to kneel before me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hallie , wo n't you ? " Yes , I mouthed nervously , just as Mama returned from the hall closet struggling under a powder-blue box uplifted in her arms . She set it on the hall table , pulling off the top that smelled of mothballs and unfolding a cloud of pastel tissue . Exhilarated , she drew out her wedding dress carefully , fingering seed pearls that sprinkled down the bodice and fluffing out a crinoline that rustled taffeta under the skirt . " Now if we can only let out the waistline a little , it will be perfect . And what should we do for Hallie ? " <p> Through the doorway I saw that my father had laid his head down on the table , but Mama was smiling and excited . Rand sat listlessly beside me , and all I felt was confused . " Oh , do n't make it such a bother , Mama , " Alice cried out . " You always have to make everything a big deal . " She ran up the stairs to her attic room , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mama was finally finishing her preparations , writing out the last announcements and pulling them into a neat stack so that Vera could add more dishes to the table . I watched as she brought in crystal bowls of nuts , silver salvers of pink mint roses , ordering them around the great icing-festooned cake in the center , until the table was filled . " Thank you so much , Vera . Now go on and take you a rest for a while until we 're ready , " my mother said , dismissing her back through the swinging door . Then she hoisted me off her lap and stood . " Now you . We have got to get you dressed and get your hair fixed . " She was hurrying me to my room when footsteps fell behind us in the hall , and she called , " William ? " <p> When she saw it was only Rand , swatting a tennis racket idly against his knee and holding the Impala keys in his other hand , she demanded , " Where have you been ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he shrugged . " Where 'd Daddy go ? " <p> She did n't answer but countered stiffly , " I had things for you to do . What came over you to run off today ? " <p> I waited as he pointed up at the ceiling , indicating Alice 's room , then spoke soft and volcanic , " She does n't care , does she ? " <p> My mother stood straight . " Alice was up late last night . As were you . You ought to know , " she accused . Alice and Rand had come in late the night before from a rehearsal party that Gill 's friends were giving them , even though there had been no rehearsal . It was at the Motel , I heard Alice tell Rand as they left , when they did n't know I was listening . I had fallen asleep visualizing it , the swimming pool glowing blue with underwater bulbs and all the doors around the motor court that winked a haze of pink , then green neon , filled with faceless friends . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dark , hearing thudding steps and stifled giggles , knowing it was way after midnight , and now <p> peered at Rand to inspect him . " Mama , it was n't all that late , all right ? " he protested . <p> " Go get ready , you hear ? " she answered , hustling me into my room by the shoulders and raising my nightgown over my head when I could have done it myself , but all I did was stand quiet . Mama pulled my dress from the chifforobe and buttoned me into it , dotted Swiss that fell to my ankles and a sash with ends that hung down my back , then I found stockings , new shoes from Vicksburg . In my parents ' room I sat before Mama 's dressing table as she coaxed my hair through her big silver brush , parting it sharply and plaiting it to the ends , which she tied with pink ribbon . Last , a single drop of Shalimar on my neck , and I sat while she stepped into a linen suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French twist with White Rain . At the dressing table , she put on eyelashes and liner , pinned on a tiny circlet of hat like no one did anymore , collected her pumps and handbag , then padded off into the hall in stocking feet , calling , " Rand ? Rand ? " <p> " Mama . " I followed her . " Does n't Alice got to get up now ? " But she was not listening . <p> Rand returned with a loud green tie and his hair wet , which my mother combed to the sides with her fingers as I looked on . Except for his longish hair that brushed against the starched collar of his shirt in curly tendrils , he already looked older , polished , as neat and grave as my father 's picture in the Phi Delt composite that hung in the hall , Daddy one tiny black and white square lost in the middle . As she arranged him , he frowned helplessly , resisting her hands , toeing his white bucks into the grooves between the long cypress floorboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? There better not be a lot of people there , is what I say . I do n't feel too well . " So they had been drinking , I thought ; that must have been the only reason he had gone . <p> " Listen , " Mama stopped , her manicured hands outstretched and imperative , " we are all going to make the best of this . " <p> Just then I saw my father on the porch , his features distorted into pieces by the panes of leaded glass in the front door , and he came inside with a look on his face as if he 'd been dreaming . Mama focused on him , " Finally you are back ! Your things are all laid out on the bed  --  " but he disregarded her , interrupting . <p> " I saw all your people down to the cafe , Maybelle . " These were the Memphis cousins . " Drinking coffee and waiting all dressed up . " <p> " William , they 're going to meet us there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the floor . <p> I hung back in the hollow of the staircase curve , wondering how we were supposed to act : everyone was apart somehow , sunk in themselves . Alice . I held up my hem so as not to tread on it , and edged slowly and unnoticed up the stairs . The curiosity of our old family house was that the stairs did n't go anywhere , only to an attic under the roof peak . Our great-great-grandfather on the Rand side had built the house , and put them there " for decoration , " Mama always said . But when Alice came home from Ole Miss , she moved into the attic , dragged up her things , and hung <p> motel " Do Not Disturb " sign on the knob of the battered door that closed shut at the top of the landing . <p> Slowly I pushed the door open , whispering , " Alice ! " feeling for once older than she , getting her up on her own wedding day with everyone acting so strange . Alice had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been here a couple of times , today it seemed as if I were seeing it for the first time . Bare boards ran steep walls fifteen feet up into ceilings , and only two dormer windows shone thin bands of light across the floor . The windows were open because there was no air conditioner up here , only a huge box fan that droned noisily and swirled the stifling air into waves , which licked under the edges of wrinkled posters she had tacked all along the walls . On the floor , album covers were scattered next to a record player still spinning at the end of a side , its needle rasping in the run-out groove , over and over . And in the middle of the room stood Alice 's bed , heaped high with clothes and covers . Alice lay lost among them . <p> I walked toward the bed and saw her asleep , tangled blond hair across bright paisley sheets , the wild pattern winding under and around her . Against the heat she had slept naked , and the covers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking I should avert my eyes , but I was stunned still , seeing her tanned shoulders disappear into the whiteness of breasts that seemed swollen , more pendulous . Suddenly it came to me I knew what Mama , Daddy , Rand knew , the knowledge that I now saw had run like a current under the surface of the house . I stepped back , breathless and filled with shame , feeling myself an ignorant child . But I managed , piping up , " Alice , you got to get up now . " <p> She stirred and , when she saw me , pulled up the sheet over her like it was nothing , smelling of smoke and spirits , mascara smudging her lashes . " Hallie Day , " she said , pronouncing my full name as I stood rigid , not sure what to say . <p> At that moment Mama came yelling up the stairs , " Let 's get you ready , " and Alice stood up , draping the sheet around her like a robe , and loped off to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouquet from the refrigerator , and idled in the hall , picking restlessly at the tight knot of carnations and greenery . I remembered things I had heard adults say , of shotguns , and people counting up on their fingers how many months since the wedding to see if it was nine , and Alice seemed vulnerable to me now , as vulnerable as I , who could only wait for her to come down . <p> She appeared at the top of the staircase with Mama hovering behind her , crowing , " Here she is ! " as Daddy and Rand walked in from the sitting room . Her hair hung across her shoulders like <p> curtain of light and her dress tumbled loose to the floor in yards and yards of white cotton gauze , its wide angel sleeves fluttering as she descended . She hesitated for a second , and in the silence I heard my father 's foot heavy on the cypress planks , saw him limp slowly up the stairs in his seersucker suit to meet her , his face fallen and sad but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and led her down , saying , " Well , come on now , we 're late . " <p> Rand jingled the keys to the Impala and opened the front door to step out , the humid air rushing in , then Mama murmured , " Your flowers , Alice . They 're in the refrigerator . " <p> But Alice said , " No , I want these , " and walked out with a train of gauze behind her into the bright heat of June that spirited through the trees . Looping the gauze over an arm , she broke off <p> stem of hydrangeas from our bush and cradled it in her arms , even as the petals fell on her dress , scattered in her hair . <p> Mama called out , " Vera , " who came out the door wearing an orchid corsage and got in the back seat of the car on the other side of Alice from me . Mama was in the front , squeezed up between Daddy and Rand , so that her elbow was in my face . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I felt faintly ill . <p> " It 's hot in here , " Rand complained , but no one replied , because Daddy soon pulled the Impala up to the vestibule of the church , where a small crowd of people was waiting under the Gothic arches against the sun because we were late . The minute we opened the doors , my mother 's friend Ticey Williamson clambered rapidly toward us , the panels of her long aqua chiffon dress shaking back and forth . My mother had asked her to " direct " the wedding . " Y'all hurry up , " she ordered , marching us through all the people toward the sanctuary . " I have had Estelle playing the organ for half an hour . " As we moved through the cloister behind her , I noticed the piteous looks on the faces of the Memphis cousins and looked away , but beyond them was only a throng of unfamiliar people , loud and fidgeting , the Thrashers upon Thrashers I had imagined . <p> While we waited for everyone to resume their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muddy chords of organ to swell . For a small moment , we seemed to share some kind of understanding , of having something to get done , but then Mrs. Williamson said , " Here , " crooking Rand 's arm around Mama 's and pushing them through the doorway . " Now go . " <p> Then it was my turn , and I trod down the aisle towards the giant , unadorned cross that hung over the altar , then turned my back as I had been told . All too soon , my father and Alice were following . as everyone rose to their feet and admired , as her hair caught the light from the tinted windows and hydrangea petals fluttered to the floor in the wake of her billowing white hem . In front of us all , Gill took her hand from Daddy , and as I looked again at his green eyes , I realized that it was not him , that he was not the reason we were sad . The reverend began speaking then , but though his words sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain on the ears of the people , who did not seem to be listening . Rand was inspecting all the Thrashers across the aisle , while my mother sat with her face perfectly composed , beaming at no one . It appeared as if my father might start crying again . Right then , I closed my eyes and , behind them , saw what <p> was feeling : the dull , empty dark that was bearing us away , each from one another . <p>
