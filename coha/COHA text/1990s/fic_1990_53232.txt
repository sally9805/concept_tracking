AS SOON AS HIS GUESTS LEFT , Martin hurried to the green-house to bring the plants into the living room . As he went , he took off his dinner jacket and tie and dropped them on the front hall table . Unbuttoning the top stud of his shirt , he shooed away the tabby cat who tried to rub against his legs . <p> The larger trees towered over him , but their green wooden tubs rolled easily on casters . They clattered loudly as he pushed them , one by one , over the stone tiles of the hall . Upstairs , Hillie , his new wife , shifted in her sleep , smiled briefly , and went on dreaming . <p> Two orange trees he placed just at the edge of the red oriental carpet , forming a gateway into the rest of the room . His glasses had steamed up and as he polished them with his handkerchief he looked around nearsightedly . He liked to start with the larger trees ; they made a framework for the rest . He did n't move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair amount and talking with his friends about the old days . <p> The banana trees were on rollers , also the palms with their long fringes and the various species of bamboo : the Sinobambusa with its purplish stalks and the giant Dendrocalamus . <p> It was unusually warm for the south of England , and as he unlatched the windows to let in the damp midnight air , he unbuttoned the rest of his shirt . Already the living room smelled less of stale cordials and cigar ash as the orange trees , jostled by the move , gave off their fragrance . <p> Martin worked slowly , pausing sometimes to run his fingers down the central spine of a palm leaf , feeling its resilience . He knew that this arrangement would take the better part of the night . It was n't totally accurate : there had n't been any fig trees behind his cabin in Lower Burma , but he liked the texture they gave to the scene , so he pushed them in anyway . Also he had n't succeeded with tropical Asian fruits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprout , the durians sent up etiolated stalks which dwindled and died . <p> He hugged the pots of jasmines close to him as he carried them in , the white ones with their maddening sweetness , the yellow ones tickling his neck and swaying over his shoulder , lithe and tipsy like young girls at the end of the dance . <p> His view camera stood on its tripod by the couch , its black cape ruffled on top of the teakwood box . He did n't think he would use it tonight , but he felt comfortable having it there-a friendly presenceand he would n't have to explain himself if anyone should happen in on him . <p> It was n't likely that anyone would . Hillie had excused herself before the brandy . She was in the early months of pregnancy and tired easily . <p> They had met in London while she was finishing some research and translation for one of his colleagues . Martin had offered her a job editing his book , Plant Forms of Lower Burma . He was pleased by how quickly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . When she told him he ought to marry again , he had proposed on the spot . She was sweet , bright , and fertile . She caught on quickly . <p> He had been alone for two years after coming back to England . He supposed it would be good for him to have a family ; Hillie told him it would . <p> Upstairs Hillie tossed in her sleep . She enjoyed giving dinners , although it made her uneasy when the talk narrowed down to Rangoon and Moulmein after the war . <p> Martin had left Burma a couple of months after the violent disappearance of Gwen , his first wife . He had n't wanted to leave , had n't thought he could bear to quit the jungle and his primitive photo lab . The Forest Administration boys had pushed him , saying he should rest up in England , then come out again when the fever was gone . Perhaps if Maung Ho had stayed , he could have wrapped himself in his mosquito net and cured himself there , in his hut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone to the north . <p> Lovely Gwen . She 'd photographed people rather than vegetation . She spent her days in the villages , happiest when in the thick of faces and talk . He felt partitioned off , except among the plants . <p> Hillie did not know what Martin did when he stayed up late on summer nights . She did not feel she knew him well at all , but this did not upset her . In some way she had married him not to find out . Coming from a family with too many siblings and too many desires , she found a haven in Martin 's silence . <p> Hillie had left the north of England to go to university in London , where she found she had an amazing love of , and gift for , languages . When she realized that there was nothing God-given about the music of English , she found it simple to grasp the rhythm of any new language and internalize it , humming its music to herself until she was ready to pin meaning onto it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Dorset to work with Martin . And fall in love with him . He echoed her thoughts when he finally put his arms around her , saying , " I am so lucky to have found you . " <p> All she really knew of him after four months of marriage was his gentleness and the way he visited his greenhouse before breakfast , caressing the leaves , looking for new bloom . <p> That morning , with a thin mist rising from the garden in the unusual heat , they had thrown open the windows of the morning room before they sat down . The shimmer of yellow sunlight on the terrace made the caged parrots exclaim loudly . Wild finches chattered back from the shrubbery . Hillie poured tea . <p> " Shall I send them off , then , the proofs ? " she asked . Martin 's book was finally completed . <p> " Yes . It 's time they got off . " <p> " Perfect timing , then . The dinner tonight will be a celebration . " She stirred her tea , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . We have n't danced since the wedding , and I loved doing it with you . Tell me we 'll do it soon . " <p> He blew her an agreeing kiss and she grinned back at him . <p> Spreading a piece of toast with butter and a thick layer of strawberry jam , she gave it to him . " Does it make you sad , sending it in for good ? " <p> " A bit . Yes . A lot , actually . I suppose it 's a farewell to the jungle . " <p> She took his hand and put it to her cheek , as though the warmth and smoothness there would help him . Then she kissed his palm and closed his fingers over it . <p> " And the dedication ? " she asked . " They 're asking what you 've decided to do . Will it be to Gwen ? " <p> " Would that be all right , then ? " He looked down at his hands , opening the one she had kissed , then closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said warmly . " She was your wife . You dedicate it to Gwen , and you can put Maung Ho in the acknowledgements . And also me . " <p> During their courtship , Martin had shown Hillie pictures of the house at the edge of the jungle where he had lived for ten years . His pale blue eyes lit up as he presented his photographic portraits of tropical plants and flowers . He polished a magnifying lens and handed it to her while he pointed out details . He lingered over descriptions of male and female flowers and exotic fruits . <p> " It grows a good twenty feet high , " he said , giving her a picture of a mangosteen tree . " The leaves are large ovals  --  they glisten in the sun . And the skin of the fruit is a deep purplish brown . But the flesh is a creamy white-oh God , and it tastes like peaches and pineapple and strawberries all at once . I have n't been able to get it to grow in England , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you . " Then he kissed her . <p> There was only one photograph of Gwen , her cropped red hair and green eyes appearing weak and faded in the black and white . <p> " But surely you have more pictures of her ? " Hillie asked . <p> " I had her beside me , " Martin explained . " I did n't think to observe her . Besides , she would threaten to turn her camera on me . She would go after the villagers , you know , and photograph them . I could never do that ; it makes me nervous to take pictures of people . But she liked it . That was her job : writing about them , photographing them , and sending it all back to the newspapers here . She would talk to them , and even bring a few home , sometimes . She felt quite close to Maung Ho , our neighbor . Extraordinary fellow . Studied at mission schools , then got sent to Rangoon on a fellowship . He worked for almost a year in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand it . So he quit and came back to the jungle , getting odd jobs as a tracker . Worked for us as a guide and lived in a hut next door . Wonderful specimen . Very upset when Gwen died . " <p> Martin stopped himself and went to his closet , bringing Hillie another white cardboard box of photos . He undid the string around it and handed her the first picture . It showed Gwen 's blouse , light-colored with blackish streaks of blood . The shirt lay stretched flat on the earth . A small rock held down each sleeve at the wrist . <p> " Oh my God , " Hillie burst out . " But why ... ? " <p> " It was all I had left , " he said . " There was a breeze ; I had to put the rocks there to keep it from flapping about . It would not hold still . " <p> There was another view of the front of the shirt , from a different angle , and two pictures of the back , again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collar and along the bottom . The wind must have come up as he worked . <p> " It was green , the shirt . She always wore it . " <p> Speechless , Hillie hugged him , wanting to protect him from his loss . She thought of suggesting he bury the pictures , but in the end decided to keep silent . <p> " I think I was much better out there , until this happened . " He paused . " I 'm not good with people , you know , " he said at last . " I do n't know how to talk about ordinary things . Can you perhaps bear with me ? " <p> She held him close . <p> Hillie never told Martin that the story of his first wife 's death was not totally believable . <p> Martin had not been there when Gwen died . He had gone to Moulmein to pick up a shipment of film and chemicals . The morning that he left , Maung Ho had come over to warn them about tigers . Maneaters , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village . There had been no time for proper burial ceremonies . Instead , the remaining villagers threw the bodies into a ravine . <p> " Tigers came to eat the bodies , " Maung Ho said . " And so now they have the taste for human flesh . Not like before , when they had respect . I have seen tiger prints in the morning in the dirt around my fire ; he has come to see me while I sleep . Come to look . And then go away , because he respects me : I am hunter , he is also hunter . That was before ; not like now . " A village girl had been mauled and carried off the day before , he said , while she was harvesting corn . <p> Martin had tried to extract a promise from Gwen that she would not be foolish . When he had come back from the city , she was gone . <p> After three days Maung Ho came and stood weeping in the door-way , holding Gwen 's green shirt . Martin broke down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> He gathered his gun and water pouch and went off with Maung Ho into the jungle . For a week they hunted spoor , Martin following blindly the path hacked through the undergrowth by his guide . They came upon carcasses , hideous in the heat , but each time Maung Ho said they were not human remains . She was not there . Maung Ho wanted to stop and fish in the deep pools of a stream , using small fruits as lures , but Martin pressed them on , saying they could live on the rice they carried . <p> Feverish and starving , they finally gave up and went home . Martin stayed in his hut , in bed , while Maung Ho set out with a band of his friends to search more . <p> After four days , Maung Ho appeared with Gwen 's camera . He told where he had found it , under a fruit tree , with no signs of struggle or prints . He had lost one of his men . <p> " We were sitting in the jungle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you mean , gambling ' ? " <p> " You cut two tamarind seeds in half , so you have one white side and one black . Then you shake them in a bamboo cup ; it makes a noise : kak kak kak kak . And while you shake , everyone bets . Po Mya was shaking , and everybody sat quiet , concentrating on the color . Kak kak kak kak , no other noise . Like lightning , it came and grabbed him because he was the only thing moving . Everybody else was sitting like stumps of trees . " <p> " Lightning came ? " Martin had not yet understood Maung Ho 's story . <p> " No lightning , " Maung Ho moaned . " Tiger . Like lightning . Very quick , you know . Very quick a tiger came and grabbed Po Mya because he was shaking tamarind seed kak kak kak kak in the cup . Other people all sitting still . The tiger not sure they are alive . All may be stumps of trees . But he is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man . " <p> " How can this be true ? " <p> " Oh , yes . Witnesses . Many people left to tell about this story . One man , he says : ' That is ghost '  --  You know ghost ?  --  Come to take Po Mya away . Come so quickly . Other man says : ' That is God who come to take him . ' So fast he was , that tiger . One man says : ' Yellow tiger . ' I say : ' White tiger . ' Because I do n't know . Very quick . " <p> Maung Ho led Martin to the spot in the jungle where this had happened . Signs of a campfire , a scuffle , tracks of a cat . <p> The village headman called for a hunt . Martin was too sick to leave his hut . He had lost hope that Gwen was still alive and was afraid of what they would find . He was sick at heart ; the jungle he so loved had betrayed him . <p> Maung Ho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the village even by day . He was an old tiger with a peculiarly stubby tail . <p> " So old , old tiger , he came and roared all around the village very strong : ' AAHHM , AAHHM . I want to eat . I want to mate . ' Oh , everyone was shaking . <p> " In the morning , the head of the village hurried very many hunters to make a cage . Bamboo poles thick as my arm , stuck in the soil . Two hunters stay in the cage , with rifles . But they shoot too early , before the tiger comes out of jungle . Failure . " <p> Hillie had watched Martin 's eyes as he told her these stories . He did not show any signs of doubt . As she handed back to him the black and white pictures , she could n't help noticing that the shirt was not torn , front or back , but she did not comment . This was Martin 's story , and she did n't want to press him to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? " Hillie asked . " Did you finally see it ? " <p> " I never saw it . I never saw any tigers at all . " <p> The last few plants would n't fit in the living room ; Martin placed them in the hall . He took his discarded shirt and wiped the sweat from his face and neck . Dirt and green mold streaked his chest where he had cradled the pots . <p> He unlocked a mahogany desk at the side of the room and withdrew a box of small brass bells and a spool of fine string . This he began to weave among the plants in the hall . Keeping the string at a foot 's height from the floor , he tied bells to it  --  making a trip wire to alert him if anyone should come into the hall . <p> The tinkling of the bells , as he secured them in place , woke a pair of striped cats who had been asleep on the cool stone floor by the windows . They came to nudge and nuzzle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all the cats had been hers . <p> When all the strings were in place , Martin went to the morning room and took down the birdcages , leaving their black covers on to keep them quiet . In the living room , he latched all the windows and took out the small parrots , green with dashes of yellow . Cupping them in his hands to calm them , he whispered as he placed them in the branches of the tropical plants . They woke , chirping and muttering , and hopped from branch to branch , watching him with quizzical head-tilted looks . <p> More household cats  --  they were all tabbies , Gwen had liked tabbies-hearing and smelling the uncaged birds began to slink in among the pots . <p> He had brought his rifle back with him from Burma ; he felt it would be expected of him , though he had never used it except to make sure it fired . Loading it with cartridges from his desk , he laid his cheek against the cool of the barrel . It smelled of the sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . <p> Martin said , " Shh , pretty one , do n't worry . " <p> He went around the room and turned out the lights . The night sky was pearling into dawn . Crawling in among the plants with his rifle beside him he lay down on his back . He took off his glasses and the leaves and birds grew larger , wilder . The ruby-colored earth of the carpet smelled of mold and night-blooming jasmine . The birds hopped from branch to branch , taking forays onto bookcases and curtain rods , but always flying back to the greenery . They cackled now at the cats who stalked them . <p> The heavy warm air pressed down on her and Hillie could n't sleep . She flung her arm out , feeling for Martin , but not finding him . He probably had n't been able to sleep either and had n't wanted to wake her . He often kept late hours , sometimes photographing a plant or two in the living room . As she sat up , she felt something inside her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stiflened , waiting for it to happen again . It would n't be real unless it repeated . She placed both hands lightly on her belly and kept still , only turning her head to read the clock . Half past four . It came again , whisk  --  whisk . She leaned back and smiled . She wanted to call it out , to announce it to him . <p> In the bathroom , she splashed her face with cold water and ran a brush through her short blond hair . She checked her naked body in the mirror for any other miracles and thought that maybe her belly was rounder , her breasts not quite so small . Turning sideways she swayed her back , pushing her abdomen out to look the way she thought it should . There , it came again , just a quick flicker of sensation . " I 've woken it up , " she thought , grinning . <p> In the bedroom she threw on her nightgown , pale-green lace  --  she had brought it with her for the wedding  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his study dark , she raced down the corridor connecting the east wing to the rest of the house . Still smiling , she thought of the effect this news would have on him . He had been uncertain about having children . She had assured him it would be wonderful , and now she had proof that it was . <p> A gunshot cracked as Hillie came down the wide curved staircase . Then another . Parrots flew towards her , squawking , beating their way up the stairwell to perch on the chandelier . Potted plants stood clustered in the hall . The living room was a forest . A ringing of small bells . She tripped over a string and caught herself . <p> Everything looked wrong , upside-down . Trees packed into the living room . Martin lying under them half-naked , streaked with dirt . <p> " Martin ? Oh God , are you all right ? " A fall , a stroke , a fight , she thought . Make him be all right . Too many plants to see anything clearly . His gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speak , love . Tell me . What is it ? " <p> The orange cat lay sprawled , bleeding onto the dirt beneath a palm tree . She shuddered , cold with fear . She just wanted Martin to be alive . Anything else she could manage , they could manage together . Something inexplicable in the jungle . <p> " I shot the cat , " he said thickly . He propped himself up on one elbow . <p> " I know , " she said . <p> She slipped in among the plants and lay down next to him . <p> " What are you doing ? " he asked . <p> " I ca n't see from out there . I want to see what it looks like from where you are . " <p> Beside her Martin lay back exhausted and closed his eyes . She saw now that the black marks on his skin were mixed with green , mold from the plant pots . He looked peaceful , as though after a great exertion . <p> Overhead the palm leaves filtered the early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the front hall . The orange trees seemed very far away . <p> Hillie got up slowly and went over to the windows , pulling each of them wide open . <p> " Where are you going ? " he asked . <p> " I think we should get it out of here , " she said . " I think we should bury it before anyone gets up . " <p> She picked up the dead cat . It weighed more than she expected , and she had to hold it against her breasts . Martin came to her . <p> " Look here , do n't you want me to carry it ? You 'll get yourself all bloody . " <p> " I 've got it now . Could you bring your shirt ? " <p> They found a shovel in the garden shed and buried the animal in the black loam underneath the rhododendrons . Then she asked him to dig a smaller hole beside it . Pulling her blood-streaked nightgown over her head , she folded it carefully and laid it in the dirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched her arms above her , saluting the morning . Then she took his white shirt and put it on . He looked at her , radiant in the opalescent light . There was a smear of blood on the pale skin between her breasts . He rubbed softly at the stain with his thumb , wanting to kiss her breasts and the faint mark between them . Instead he closed the shirt , smoothing the pleats , and slowly buttoned it . <p> He pulled her to him , humming a slow waltz . They began to dance , twined around each other , turning slowly across the dew-covered grass . The first rays of golden sun lit now the skin of his bare chest , now her naked thighs . <p> <p> By GRACE DANE MAZUR <p>
