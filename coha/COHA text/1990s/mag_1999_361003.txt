Space and time are relative . Our behavior is ruled by our subconscious mind . The most powerful machines are built one atom at a time . When the history of human civilization is rewritten a few centuries hence , the name Eric Drexler just might appear alongside those of Einstein and Freud . Drexler , 43 , is the founding father of nanotechnology , the idea of using individual atoms and molecules to build practical machines . <P> Drexler was an M.I.T. undergraduate studying genetic engineering in the mid-1970s when he had his epiphany : if you could engineer DNA on a molecular level , why not build machines out of atoms , program them to build more machines and so on , until you had millions of infinitesimal nanobots , endlessly restocking the food supply , say , or swarming through the bloodstream eradicating disease , or building skyscrapers from industrial waste ? If nanotech was viable , it promised a gleaming future of virtually limitless wealth and endlessly renewable resources . <P> That 's an immense if . Drexler 's idea was initially dismissed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time travel and warp drives , nothing about it actually violates the laws of physics . And when in 1989 an IBM team famously spelled the Big Blue logo in xenon atoms , nanotech spread from the basements of feverish acolytes poring over Drexler 's seminal book , Engines of Creation ( 1986 ) , to the research labs of NASA and Xerox PARC . Today nanotech researchers speak not of if but of when . Great leaps forward come from thinking outside the box . Drexler may be remembered as the man who saw how to build a whole new box . <P>  --  By Michael Krantz
