A View from a Developing Society <p> The process of development involves change , which , in itself , implies some degree of conflict . This conflict is usually generated by a clash between the old , established order and the new , emerging ideas and realities , that is , between the traditional and the modern . This tension and conflict impact on virtually all aspects of social and political life and have affected countries at all stages of development . It is the resolution of these problems , and not the absence of them , that advances a country or society along the path of development . <p> That the social , economic , and educational realities in developing societies differ significantly from the corresponding realities in advanced societies hardly needs to be elaborated . Nonetheless , a few pertinent points need to be made . <p> Societies currently classified as developing not only face these conflicts and tensions but also experience the additional stress of the rapidly changing nature of these issues in our constantly developing global village . Thus , the pressures of population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unemployment are far more acute for today 's developing societies than they were for societies at a similar stage of development fifty years , or even twenty years , ago . Similarly , the solutions and strategies that advanced societies , such as those of the United States and Europe , have already evolved to deal with their social and political problems are not always appropriate for developing societies ( Williams 1971 ) . United States society is already an established society with its own norms , sense of values , and sanctions for antisocial behavior . Developing societies in the Caribbean and Latin America , for example , are now in the process of nation building and often may not have such clearly defined norms and values or a highly informed public to articulate and reinforce them . <p> Additionally , many developing societies encounter a number of structural and institutional constraints on the achievement of solutions to these problems . One such constraint may be a weak history of popular social and democratic involvement . In many developing societies , whether in Caribbean or African areas that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participatory democracy was not considered to be in the best interest of the colonizing powers . Consequently , such institutional provisions as local elections or village councils were rarely introduced and seldom encouraged . All the decision-making powers remained in the hands of the central authorities ; and even where any sort of elections were held , the franchise was circumscribed by a number of discriminatory criteria  --  based on wealth and property and sometimes on ethnic grouping  --  that effectively excluded the mass of the population . Universal adult suffrage , for example , was not introduced into the English-speaking Caribbean islands ( see map on page 163 ) until the 1950s . Since then , elections to the national assembly in each territory have been held every five years . <p> In addition , the dominance of this political directorate was reinforced and safeguarded by an educational system whose major function was the transmission of an ethnocentric European culture . Thus , until fairly recently , the curriculum in the English-speaking Caribbean schools was heavily British and European in content and values . Students graduated from high school knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and social structures than they did about the Caribbean . All this tended to reinforce the myth of the intrinsic superiority of things European . Since becoming independent or self-governing territories , however , the curriculum and , to a lesser extent , the whole educational system have been revised to respond better to local needs and realities . There is still , however , a considerable degree of intellectual dependence on metropolitan countries . A third constraint relates to the phenomenon of brain drain . Partly because of the above constraints and partly because of limited economic opportunities in the local society , many of the better educated and more ambitious citizens tended to migrate to more developed countries where opportunities were much greater . As a result , these developing societies regularly lost the very persons they most desperately needed to assist in their development process . Education and Nation Building <p> It is perhaps superfluous to argue whether education has an important role to play in the development process in so-called Third World countries . With respect to this role , however , there is much less of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers view education as an agent of change , but they agree less on whether it is a reactive , interactive , or proactive agent ( Boocock 1985 ; Figueroa and Persaud 1986 ; Robinson 1981 ) . The role of education in development has also been examined and critiqued from a number of perspectives , such as demographic , social inequalities and mobility , productivity , and earnings ( Bowles and Gintis 1976 ; Halsey and Floud 1961 ; Adams 1977 ) . <p> MacIntosh ( in Williams 1971 ) argues that one of the developmental functions of education and schools , in addition to providing skills , is to train minds in order to develop in students pride in their own society , a knowledge of and appreciation for its traditions , and an understanding of the broader world context . This purpose is best realized if the content of the syllabus is relevant and meaningful to the students ' own experience and , by extension , provides a sound cognitive basis on which to explain and explore the social roles of the students in their society and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 8 ) from his perspective , posits that the most significant developmental tasks of education in developing countries are to help students , both young and adult , " to acquire the knowledge , the skills , and the attitudes and values which will enable them to initiate , accept , and adjust constructively to the changes which are both conditions and consequences of modernization . " <p> In the process of nation building , the commitment and input of individual citizens are critical ; and the education system must provide them with the requisite skills and attitudes in order to be effective and useful citizens , as well as with the opportunities to apply these skills constructively and to demonstrate these attitudes . Social Studies in Developing Societies <p> It is against this background that an attempt is made to examine a role for social studies in the development process in developing societies . <p> Dudley Seers , a noted Third World economist , identifies as one of the functions of education in developing societies the task of providing trained and knowledgeable persons with a good and balanced understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see and appreciate the needs of their society and will prepare them to act on these views ( see Wilbur 1973 ) . <p> This call for an informed citizenry capable of effective participation in society and , by extension , in the development process reasserts one of the fundamental goals of social studies education . Seers further observes that many of the obstacles to development policies have their origin in the realm of attitudes toward some of the existing social and economic phenomena , among which he lists manual work , imported goods , and foreign technologies , and to which academic education may be added . A similar veiw has been expressed by Carrington ( 1978 ) . Coincidentally , this focus on attitudes and values also reflects another of the major concerns of social studies . <p> These two important areas of social studies education have recently been restated and re-emphasized by such eminent educators as Longstreet ( 1989 ) , Parker ( 1988 ) , and Engle and Ochoa ( 1988 ) . Engle and Ochoa , in particular , see the major aims of social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state as well as active participants in its development . They also argue for open and regular debates on areas of social conformity , and they see the serious study and analysis of specific social issues as an intergral part of social studies and of education for citizenship . As Jack Nelson ( 1988 , p. 546 ) observed in his review of the Engle and Ochoa text : " If we can produce skeptical and thoughtful citizens capable of critical assessment of society and participation in its improvement , that would be a particularly significant contribution by Social Studies . " <p> In short , these writers , along with others such as Patton ( 1988 ) , strongly support the concept and practice of social participation and the need for social contributions from citizens , informed , as they should be , by a questioning attitude and the application of thinking skills . It would seem , therefore , that social studies is uniquely placed to contribute significantly to the enterprise of nation building . Social Studies in the English-speaking Caribbean <p> Traditionally , the role of social studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been cast more in the conceptual mold of " knowledge of the past " ( Brubaker et al . 1977 ) fused with some knowledge of local institutions . This mix was variously labeled as Civics or Current Affairs or even General Knowledge . In any event , the emphasis has traditionally been on knowledge and the learning of actual information with respect to political , social , and economic institutions  --  in other words , a basic emphasis on " product . " This approach represents the false , but unfortunately still widely held , belief that social studies is mainly about the acquisition of knowledge and facts . <p> There have been , however , some recent changes in this approach and the status of social studies in the English-speaking Caribbean . The term social studies is now generally accepted and has been used since the early 1970s . The regional examining body  --  the Caribbean Examinations Council ( CXC ) , which was established in 1973  --  is offering an examination and certification in social studies . The United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the University of the West Indies ( UWI ) , to develop curricular materials in social studies for use in primary schools in the English-speaking Caribbean . <p> The University of the West Indies ( UWI ) campuses , in Jamaica ( the Mona Campus ) and in Trinidad ( the St. Augustine Campus ) , have developed strong programs in social studies education in their respective Faculties of Education . The Faculty at the St. Augustine Campus has been publishing a journal , Social Studies Education , since 1974 . There is an increasing flow of publications in social studies for Caribbean schools at both the primary and secondary levels and for teachers ( Waterman 1986 ; Beddoe et al . 1989 ; Brathwaite et al . 1988 ; King et al . 1983 ) . The Faculties of Education at Mona and at St. Augustine and at the Cave Hill Campus in Barbados as well as teachers and tutors who have had training abroad in the United Kingdom and North America have infused some of the recent trends and current theories into the field of social studies education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1987 , for example ) was devoted entirely to teaching techniques in social studies . In other words , increasing attention is being paid to process . A Dynamic for Nation Building <p> Based on the foregoing views of the role of education in the process of nation building , the following dynamic for teaching social studies in developing societies is an attempt to synthesize in a diagram those ideas and perceptions expressed above . The dynamic is both cyclical and spiral , yet quite open in concept , with ever-widening and increasingly complex operations . <p> The dynamic attempts to fuse the laudable need for acquiring knowledge and understanding about one 's own society with the desirable and necessary aim of training students to be thinking citizens , equipped and willing to participate in the task of nation building . <p> Any of the topics in a well-structured social studies program lends itself to generating local topical issues that can satisfy Patton 's ( 1980 ) criteria for significance and , at the same time , provide the relevant knowledge base and the opportunity for the application of thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the students ' experience and environment . Moreover , in the process of investigating and researching a given local issue , the students will acquire additional and necessary background knowledge and a more-informed perspective and understanding . Thus , they will become more highly informed about their indigenous culture , heritage , and societal systems . Such knowledge is , in effect , a first step in the whole process of nation building . The understanding gained will also , of necessity , interrelate with the structure of social studies as a discipline , introducing students to the instructional objectives and nature of knowledge in social studies . Therefore , this activity will also enhance the cognitive and intellectual development of the students , requiring the application of both social and thinking skills that can be transferred to other areas of learning . <p> Although values and attitudes are often explicitly included as specific objectives in a social studies curriculum in developing countries , there is reason to believe that many classroom activities treat these objectives as merely intellectual exercises . Far too little time is devoted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If social studies is indeed to contribute effectively to development and nation building , much more emphasis needs to be placed on the study of local , topical issues and on the search for alternatives . Informed , thinking , and involved citizens are perhaps the best guarantee for democracy and , certainly , for nation building and social development . What is needed now are teachers trained in this approach . <p> In this dynamic , the focus on a local topical issue will impact on the value principles of the student , thus necessitating some clarification of these principles . Both students and society will benefit from the clarification because it will result in greater appreciation for local realities and a more clearly defined sense of their responsibility and the potential contributions that they can make to social development . Decisions and choices can therefore be made based on realities , not on social or historical myths and false values . ( For example , although agriculture is the major foreign exchange earner for almost all Caribbean countries , the level of participation by those leaving school is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general perception of agriculture as being a reminder of slavery . Recent research by Caribbean scholars , however , indicates that wages , working conditions , and opportunities are far more critical factors ) . From this point , the students , now as more-informed and thinking citizens , are well placed to articulate and act upon the nature and specifics of their contribution to , and their participation in , the process of nation building in their society . <p> MAP : FIGURE 1  --  Map of the Caribbean Islands . <p> DIAGRAM : FIGURE 2  --  A Dynamic for Nation Building through Social Studies <p>
