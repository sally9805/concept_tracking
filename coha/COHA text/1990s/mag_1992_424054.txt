Section : ACCESS Wild and Scenic Rivers , some of the most stunning in the United States , are preserved as part of the park system . <p> SINCE FEDERAL legislation established the Wild and Scenic Rivers System in 1968 , the National Park Service has been involved in preserving rivers as free-flowing waterways accessible for public use and pleasure . As of last summer , the service counted 31 river components in 13 states under its administration . <p> Some of the most stunning and important rivers in the United States are part of this system . Rivers may be designated wild or scenic to draw attention to their important roles in the country 's natural or cultural history , to protect them from threatened development , or to preserve their unique cultural or natural characteristics for future generations . Designation takes an act of Congress or assignment by the Secretary of the Interior . And it ensures some legal protections against adverse development as well as management mechanisms for river resources and federal lands that are within the river corridor . <p> More than 2,399 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service 's jurisdiction supply habitat for endangered species of birds and fish , offer a glimpse into history , or provide some of the best canoeing in the country . Some rivers are accessible only by trail ; others are easily reached by highway or railroad . All of these rivers offer a variety of activities and foster an appreciation for beautiful and wild places . Kings River <p> In the glacial lakes above the timberline in Kings Canyon and Sequoia national parks in California , the waters of the Kings River begin a journey through deep-sided canyons and open meadows , over falls and cataracts . Fifty-five miles of two Kings River branches  --  the Middle and South Forks  --  are within Kings Canyon National Park , which encompasses more than 450,000 acres of wilderness . To the north and south , the rivers are flanked by cedar forest , and to the southwest are groves of giant sequoias . The sequoias are known as the largest growing trees on Earth , and they grow naturally only along a 280-mile stretch of the Sierra Nevada 's western slopes . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity of Muir Pass ( 11,955feet ) and Black Giant ( 13,330feet ) in the northern end of Kings Canyon National Park and flows for 27 miles before entering Sierra National Forest . One of the last free-flowing , primitive High Sierra rivers left in California , the Kings River cascades through glaciated valleys and alpine meadows and plummets into LeConte Canyon and Devil 's Washbowl in Kings Canyon National Park . It widens slightly as it passes on to the Tehipite Valley close to the park 's western border . Within the park , the river is accessible only by foot in the Tehipite Valley area . <p> The South Fork of the river , flowing through one of the deepest glacial canyons in the United States , picks up speed as it plunges from 4,600 feet at its head to 200 feet where it joins the Middle Fork in the national forest . It runs for 38 miles within Kings Canyon and is most spectacular when currents rage with spring melt . <p> Within the park , visitors may enjoy the South Fork along hiking , motoring , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be used within the park parameters , some swimming is allowed . <p> Visitors to the Kings River branches may consider lodge accommodations at Cedar Grove , within Kings Canyon National Park . About 360 campsites are available in the area , as are flush toilets , telephones , camper store , food service , laundromat , pay showers , and service station . Permits are required for backcountry camping . The access road to the park is open from May through October , though some late fall and winter access is allowed for skiing and hiking . <p> Outstanding natural features in the region include Boyden Cave , part of a five-mile underground system , and Mount Whitney , the highest mountain in the contiguous United States at 14,494 feet of elevation . Mount Whitney is located in Sequoia National Park . <p> For more information about Kings Canyon National Park and the Kings River , call ( 209 ) 565-3134 . Charley Wild River <p> Tucked deep in the unspoiled wilderness of central Alaska , the Charley River runs cold and clear through the 2.5 million-acre Yukon-Charley Rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the designated wild river begins in the Yukon-Tanana uplands and flows north through stream-cut valley and open floodplain . For more than 108 miles , the Charley travels in the shadow of mountain peaks higher than 6,000 feet and passes beneath high bluffs and cliffs to the Yukon Valley , where rapids slow to a crawl , and the Charley eventually joins the Yukon River . <p> The Charley descends from about 4,000 feet at its headwaters to 700 feet at the Yukon . It takes an average of six days to travel the distance in a raft or a kayak , though additional days are needed to float the Yukon for take out at Circle , Alaska . The best boating on the Charley is from June through August , but during low water floaters may have to portage over shallow areas , rocks , or gravel bars . The upper two-thirds of the river drops an average of 31 feet per mile , providing excellent white water for rafters and kayakers . ( Open canoes are discouraged . ) Most of the river is rated " intermediate " on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more difficult . " <p> The area hosts about 20 percent of Alaska 's peregrine falcons , which hatch and raise their young in the steep river bluffs . The area also is calving ground for the Fortymile caribou herd , and grizzly and black bears , moose , and fox are abundant . <p> Access to the region around the Charley River basin is by Taylor Highway to Eagle or Steese Highway from Fairbanks to Circle . Scheduled flights to both towns are available in Fairbanks . <p> Minimal impact camping is allowed within the Yukon-Charley preserve , but group size should be ten people or fewer . Neither fees nor permits are required to use the Yukon and Charley rivers . <p> For additional information , write to the Superintendent , Yukon-Charley Rivers National Preserve , P.O. Box 167 , Eagle , AK , 99738 ; or telephone ( 907 ) 547-2233 . Niobrara River <p> Three segments of Nebraska 's Niobrara River are among the most recent additions to the Wild and Scenic Rivers System , designated as scenic or recreational components in May 1992 . Landowners in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Niobrara be protected in the national river system . <p> The Niobrara River valley is known as a biological crossroads , being the farthest east extension of the ponderosa pine forests and the farthest west extension of deciduous woodlands . With sandhill prairie to the south of the river and mixed prairie grassland to the north , the area is a biological melting pot that boasts plant and animal species of up to six ecological systems . Additionally , the river provides whooping cranes , least terns , piping plovers , and bald eagles  --  endangered or threatened species  --  a place to nest , winter , or roost during migration . <p> The Niobrara Valley also is rich in relics of earlier times . Fossil sites along the river provide clues to animal species of the Miocene , Pliocene , and Pleistocene eras . Evidence of nomadic Plains Indian tribes that used the Niobrara as a highway is scattered along the river tributaries . And canyons off of the river 's southern slope have protected pockets of glacial-age plant communities , such as groves of paper birch trees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range . <p> The Niobrara River lives up to its Indian name , meaning " running water . " Because it is spring fed out of the Nebraskan sandhills and has a consistent drop of 9-1/2 feet per mile , it runs at a steady current of four to seven miles per hour all year . Backpacker magazine has rated the Niobrara among the country 's ten best canoeing rivers . <p> The customary canoe launch site is the Cornell Bridge and Dam , off of Route 12 north of Valentine and on the 40-mile stretch of the upper Niobrara , which is designated as a national scenic river . The Rock Dam area , about 25 miles downriver , is a typical canoe takeout point . Niobrara waters east of Egelhoff Narrows require more attention and skill , because the river is broader , shallower , and interrupted by sandbars . <p> This upper stretch of river , situated between northern woods , the Ozarks to the east , and the Rocky Mountains to the west , also is considered prime camping and hiking territory . Private campgrounds are located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfalls and stretch beyond the canyon rim through open forest and prairie . This year , the state established a 200-acre park near Smith Falls , the highest waterfall in Nebraska . <p> For more information about commercial campgrounds and canoeing outfitters , call the Valentine Chamber of Commerce , 1-800-658-4024 . St. Croix Riverway <p> Before the arrival of whites in the 1600s , the St. Croix River and its valley in the Upper Midwest were home to the Dakota Indians , who later were joined by the Chippewa in plying the water and land for fish , game , and wild rice . The region eventually attracted the French , who sought the pelts of an abundant beaver population . Later still , as white settlements spread along the lower river valley around 1839 , the upper St. Croix valley surrendered its rich white pine forests as timber for a developing nation . Lumbering continued for about 75 years , with logs driven downstream in such numbers , they choked the St. Croix River during spring months . <p> Today St. Croix and its Namekagon River tributary are protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scenic Riverway . Located in Wisconsin and Minnesota , close to the Twin Cities , the clean , free-flowing waterway cuts through some of the least developed country in the region . <p> Wildlife along the river changes with the habitat over 252 miles . New-growth forests of pines , brush , and hardwoods are home to deer , and the riverway marshes are home to wood ducks , mallards , and great blue herons . Osprey and bald eagles nest in the region . Mink , beaver , otter , and muskrat inhabit the rivers , and a variety of songbirds and mammals pervade the valley . Brown trout inhabit the Namekagon , and bass , muskellunge , walleye pike , and sturgeon are among the species found in the St. Croix . <p> The Namekagon and the upper St. Croix are narrow , twisting channels best traveled by canoe . The Namekagon flows from a heavily forested area to a wide valley , sometimes widening into marshy areas popular for viewing waterfowl . In its lower portion , the Namekagon winds through high sandy banks , insulating explorers from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and widens at its confluence with the Namekagon , about 20 miles downstream . From there , much of the river flows through a wide valley with low banks . <p> St. Croix Riverway is not considered a whitewater system , though low , medium , and even high rapids exist on the rivers . On-water activities range from canoeing , innertubing , and boating to water skiing . Explorers also enjoy the waterway by land , taking advantage of hiking trails , which can be used for crosscountry skiing in winter months . <p> Many primitive campsites are accessible through parking areas in the federal region or by water . There are developed campgrounds along the river , including private and Minnesota state park locations . Motels , cabins , and resorts also are established along the riverway , nearby lakes , and rivers . <p> For more information about the St. Croix Riverway , call ( 715 ) 483-3284 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Kings River in Kings Canyon and Sequoia national parks , California . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Niobrara River in Nebraska . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riverway in Wisconsin and Minnesota . <p> By Bess Zarafonitis <p> <p> Bess Zarafonitis is a writer who is based in Gales Ferry , Connecticut .
