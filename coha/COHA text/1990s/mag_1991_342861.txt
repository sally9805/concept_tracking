Excerpts from the President 's letter to Saddam Hussein , given to Tariq Aziz by U.S. Secretary of State James Baker : <P> " There can be no reward for aggression . Nor will there be any negotiation . Principle can not be compromised . However , by its full compliance , Iraq will gain the opportunity to rejoin the international community . <P> " More immediately , Iraq and the Iraqi military establishment will escape destruction . But unless you withdraw from Kuwait completely and without condition , you will lose more than Kuwait . You may be tempted to find solace in the diversity of opinion that is American democracy . You should resist any such temptation . Diversity ought not to be confused with division . Nor should you underestimate , as others have before you , America 's will . "
