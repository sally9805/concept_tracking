One Sudden , Quiet Knowing . <p> I find myself thinking more and more of Mariellen M. , though I knew her only vaguely and am not likely to encounter her again . <p> We had just two conjunctions . The first was a July 4th , in the backyard of an architect-friend . Maybe she was 28 , maybe I was 24 , but no one failed to notice that Mariellen was the woman and I the girl . She had a pornographic figure , so cute and spunky I thought at once of the Barbie doll . Her shorts were azure-colored , brief , easily lifted by the tongue of warned air . Her shirt was a modest IZOD , her feet bare , her black hair feminine and effortless about her neck . <p> In the still-life freeze-frame I carry of Mariellen , she is laughing , sun on her teeth , hand in her husband 's , eyes out beyond the suburban deck where her girls , aged five and three , are skipping , stark naked , between the meager fingers of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time she 's saying , ironic humor in her voice , " Just look at that . Two little girls and already they love being naked . " Maybe Mariellen was n't all doll when she laughed , but the impression she made had its impact . <p> I sit somewhere behind Mariellen M. on the deck in that freeze-frame , catching the sun but not casting a shadow . I sit in a loose dress that hides my formlessness , my boyish smallness , and I sit with my hands to myself , folded in . I am not yet married , though the man who will be my husband stands nearby , and I am moody , reflective , an outsider , a guest at a party of my future husband 's friends . I spend my time watching Mariellen 's family and it occurs to me , strikes me hard at the end of the day , that the four of them are what a family should be : carefree and trusting , fingers entwined . I will aspire to that , I say to myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next time I saw Mariellen M. it was much too cold for that time of year and far too wet to stomping through a half-built house , imagining a roaring fire in the fireplace or a garden out beyond the molten concrete pads . Nevertheless , we were there - Mariellen , the architect-friend , my husband , and me . Yes , I was married by then , four years married to a gentle Salvadoran . I was there in that house with my husband , and I was holding the only child we 'll ever have . <p> Though I did n't know that part yet . What I knew was we had come to that place because my husband was an architect too , and because he and the mutual friend had jointly brought this house to life in the woods , turning drawings into stone . I though it was a beautiful house and Mariellen seemed delighted . Even though her family ( which had grown to include another child , a son ) had not made the trip with her that day , I was confident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those woods . <p> In the house that day there was work to be done . It was raining , and I took my son to the mezzanine level where the windows already had their glass and the bridgeways had railings . Mariellen stayed downstairs and I watched her from where I was . I remember thinking how remarkable the seemed , how much in command . She had energy and ideas and she urged the contractors on with a woman 's wile , measuring the planes with an old-fashioned squaring device and running her polished nails across the sawdust surfaces . " Buddy , " she 'd say to whomever was near , " plane that door one more time , for my sake . " And of course Buddy would , because a doll had addressed him and because nothing was denied Mariellen . <p> Later , the architects came in from outside where they 'd been checking on grout . Mariellen was in front of the fireplace by then , tapping the glazed bricks and smiling . " Not bad , boys , " I heard her say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that and then the architects nodded ; they all traded high fives and proud smiles . So satisfied with the strength of that house . <p> Still upstairs I watched the celebration - a spectator once again , an outsider . It was Mariellen who remembered me first , and with her free hand she gestured me down the stairs . I came , climbing the steps in loud shoes with my son , clumsy in the way that plank boards and small children can make one . <p> By the time I reached the bottom step , my son was sobbing , suddenly hungry for milk , but I was too shy to lift my shirt in front of so many men , in front of Mariellen . Maybe she guessed that . Maybe the noise of a hungry child in her house provoked her . It does n't matter . She chose to speak to me : " Give your whole self , " she counselled , though it was milk that she meant . It was one mother to another , and I complied . <p> Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hearsay , from stories told about her and passed on to me . I learned how she had married young , settling down with her husband in a crowded college dorm . I was told she traded a degree for love , but no one questioned her authority . I was made to imagine how she did it all - cooked , mothered , wived , ran , powered a house right up out of the earth - and how she did it all like an unbound spirit . <p> And then there was the story told about that third and unplanned child . She was nearly five months pregnant before she let on that she was . By then it was too late and there were complications and she was given no choice but to spend the remaining four months inside hospital walls , fighting her body 's urge to empty itself of her burden . She spent the whole time on her side , away from her children , too far from her husband , unable even to read . <p> There were no more Mariellen stories after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had our own lives to live . There was our son and things were n't going as planned . There were issues , unsettling indications that our precious child was not altogether well . <p> For awhile it was life and death to me that the facts not be found out , that my theory of family live on . My husband was smarter than I was , and insisted , in the end , on a diagnosis . When it came back , when the words were there on the white medical page - developmental disorder , language impediments , genetic complications - all that mattered then was that my husband and I clench our fists , love our child , and fight hard and hours of it , and huge hope , and prayers . Our eyes always looking for signs , looking for progress , our hearts always able to find it . Though our bodies grew weary and our lives grew as small as the fists we were making . Our days lost their firmness , their measure . <p> I eventually forgot all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stopped thinking of her , so it shocked me when my husband came home one night with the news that Mariellen was gone . Packed up and left - her husband , her children , her come in the tress - for a man she 'd met 15 years before in that crowded college dorm . <p> I pressed my husband for details , but he had no more to give . " That 's it , that 's all I know , " he said . " Gone . No one has heard from her since . " <p> Ever since my husband 's revelation , Mariellen 's disappearance has been at me , in me . When no one is looking , I give my energy to it . I shuffle the clues like a detective with a portmanteau of freeze-frames . I see the hands clasped . I see the children unbridled . I see the perfect nails inside the pine-board shavings . I hear the voice . In my mind 's eye , I see a woman shaking her petals to the earth , lifting her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to follow . <p> But how could she ? I ask the question and I believe it is valid . How could she , with all that she had ? <p> It 's a tricky business - indeed , it is n't my business - imagining the urge that broke through , the rope that tightened and snapped in a woman I know no better than once-read fiction . But I persist . I take it clue by clue . I do n't let it go . <p> Between a man and a woman , one can not rightly say . The horror , the engulfing horror , is the children . Leaving , as she did , those children in mid-sentence , mid-mood , mid-becoming . I imagine her in their rooms that last night , pressing them with kisses , speaking the fatal final words , turning off the light , guessing the future . I imagine her taking in their odors , holding her breath , closing her lips , afraid to exhale , afraid of losing one small particle of them . I imagine the children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> I think of myself and how , at age 24 , ten years ago , I began my pursuit of a rooting-in place : sun and soil . I had drawn a conclusion , I had made my resolve , I had sketched out the line of my life . I had wanted : a man loved , children , mine . A modest home , a small circle of friends , a name steady and certain , days peeling off bitter and burning sweet as the skin of red certain . As if plans were somehow burning sweet as the skin of red onions . As if plans were somehow guarantees . <p> And yet - finally sprouted with family - I have found myself longing for wind . Ungraciously longing to be swept sparse and stemless through the storm of sky , to be dropped down rootless in a place I can not name . Because a child cries and I can not cure . Because the future asks and I do not know . Because a child cries and I can not cure . Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have talked too long , too insignificantly , and wish to be gone from my own smell . Because I can no longer hold the molecules of my life on the palm of my hand and make sense of the strange markings there . I am guilty of it ; I find myself longing for wind . To be borne off , free . To ascend an unknown distance , to ride the current , to bruise against the cloth of clouds . I am a mother , a wife , a woman at dawn , clenched and dangerous within herself , by herself , faithless with wondering , faithless with imagining , with wanting to know one thing only : What calms a woman in the midst of her storm ? Is it the strengthening of roots , or is it flight ? <p> After all these calculating dawns , after all these hours in the dark alone , I can not conclude . Can not separate the facts , can not cast a line into the blame , can not define my own ambition , my demons . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is it courage or fear that makes a woman run ? <p> Mariellen thought she knew ; I never will . She drew a conclusion , followed her instincts , ripped herself out of the earth in a storm . Has she survived ? I do not know . She is gone . She has left no trace , not even shadows . <p> For me in this morning , at the break of this light , there is only one thing , and that is this : In the room above where I write , two sleep still - a husband , a son , together and apart , churning in their dreams . <p> In his bed , my husband is releasing fragments of Spanish to the air , remembering the jungle of his birth , thinking of the journey he did not think would end here . Even as he sleeps , he wonders . <p> In his bed , my son , my only child , is playing his hand like an instrument , turning his right foot around and around like the time on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snorting , wheezing , giggling , perhaps , amazed and afraid of the night . <p> And I know that when he wakes , my husband will bring his body down to mine - surprised perhaps to find me there , but trusting . And when he wakes , my son will be surprised by the language he finds . He will press his cheek against mine , in need . He will lead me by the hand to a park bench in winter , gather sticks to eat with and leaves for gruel , and show me how to sup like kings . He will remind me of how far he has come and how long the journey still is , and he will trust me to go the distance with him . <p> That , in this dawn , is all there finally is : two sleeping still , three restless hearts , one sudden , quiet knowing that these things I will not surrender , in the midst of this great storm . <p> Article copyright Iris . <p> Article copyright Iris : A Journal About Women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
