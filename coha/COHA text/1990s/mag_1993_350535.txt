The fire that consumed the stolen Chevrolet ambulance was so powerful that it vaporized the vehicle 's upholstery , so there was not much left of Anwar Aziz , the man inside : only a carbonized corpse , its left foot dangling out the driver 's door . Aziz would not have wanted it different , however , for he had set out that day to be Gaza 's Dec. 13 martyr . <P> On Dec. 13 , last Monday , real peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians was supposed to begin . That was the day on which , under the terms of the accord signed on the White House lawn in September , the Israelis were to start withdrawing troops from the Gaza Strip . The withdrawal has been delayed , but to demonstrate their scorn for the deadline before it had even passed , members of Islamic Jihad , an extremist Muslim fundamentalist group , decided to deploy a weapon only recently borrowed from Muslim radicals elsewhere  --  the suicide car bomber . So early Monday morning at a highway intersection just outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israeli patrol .

The p.l.o . has no power , " said an unemployed agricultural worker in the crowd that watched Aziz 's corpse being lifted from the blackened wreckage . Israeli soldiers holding assault rifles stood around the crossroads , where faded Palestinian flags drooped from the rooftops . " Get moving . Get off the streets , " a loudspeaker on an Israeli jeep warned loiterers in Arabic . <P> In Jabaliya , the largest refugee camp in the Gaza Strip and the birthplace of the anti-Israeli intifadeh , Aziz 's family and friends raised a tent for week-long mourning ceremonies .

" Since 1948 we have never been happy , " she said . " We have no land , no security , no hope , no future .

In 1991 Anwar was arrested as a suspected Islamic Jihad supporter , and spent two years in prison in the Negev desert . He was released only last April . <P> Aziz shared a four-room cement blockhouse with 16 relatives . The room he lived in with his wife and two young children is decorated with the wooden model of Jerusalem 's al-Aqsa mosque , which he completed in prison .
