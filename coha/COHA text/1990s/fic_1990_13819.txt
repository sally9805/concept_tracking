We are in Boswell T-Thorp 's apartment . It is nighttime . Boswell T-Thorp , a man in his forties , stands in colorful pants . He is bare-chested . Bright squares are painted around his breasts . There is a small purple square in the center of his forehead . Throughout the following , he dresses . He puts on , a square shirt , a square tie , square shoes , a square wig , a square belt , and so forth . His box attire should be shabby , well-worn . Maxwell T-Thorp , Boswell 's younger brother , follows him around in despair . T-THORP ( To imaginary people . ) Good evening ; good evening . I 'm Boswell T-Thorp . The Box Theory ? Yes , that was mine . I invented it . It came from me . T-THORP I wish you could  --  I do n't understand  --  I need someone to explain . T-THORP ( To imaginary people . ) Quite right . Quite right . There 's no place but box . T-THORP Because , you see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't she love me ? ! What made her stop loving me ? ! T-THORP Please , please , please ! Ca n't you see I 'm trying to get into the party mode ? ! T-THORP Yes , of course . Go ahead . Forgive me. p. 3 T-THORP ( To imaginary people . ) Ho ! Ho , ho ! Of course I recall it . The Box Salute . ( He does the Box Salute . ) T-THORP It 's all so funny ! It 's funny . Because you never know how it will end . What it all will come to . I thought it was good . But it was not good . I was wrong . I was mistaken . A mistake was made ! T-THORP I 'm thinking you should leave . Tab some ear fuel and dust . T-THORP Please , you 're my brother . I need a helping hand . T-THORP I 'm preparing for the party . T-THORP No doubt you 're a hobnob . No doubt . T-THORP Ho , ho , Do you think I enjoy Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig ? You must know how I suffer around the social scene . T-THORP Yes , yes , of course . T-THORP But a man must eat . After all , there are price tags to be paid . Bills to be swallowed . T-THORP Yes , please , you must go on the Celebrity Chase . You must return to the limelight . T-THORP Well , I 'm glad you comprehend . After all , tonight you are not on my menu . Now tab the fuel . p. 4 T-THORP ( Tabbing some ear fuel . ) They say this stuff 'll eventually kill you . T-THORP Yes , well , breathing will eventually kill you . ( William , a women in her twenties , enters . She wears an orange splatter 's suit , helmet , and boots . ) SMIT Hello . T-THORP Is this your tenant ? T-THORP Yes , yes , I 'm forced to take in government tenants now . Look at this one ! A splatterer from the CTZ . I hope you 're satisfied . If only you would lend me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear fuel . ) The Tank Bureau 's cut back . What can I do ? T-THORP Personal sacrifice , more work hours , Lotto Dot ! What do I care ? Get me K ! I need K ! T-THORP Please , stop harping . I 'm suffering here ; I 'm suffering . ( Max clutches his heart in agony . ) My God ! T-THORP What ? T-THORP My heart is bleeding . Look , it 's bleeding . Blood . Black blood . I 'm dying . Oh my God . I 'm dying . T-THORP Let me see . Hold still ! You are a swizzle-headed goat . This is an ink stain . It 's ink . From a pen in your pocket . p. 5 T-THORP It 's the pen she gave me . It 's my moon pen . Oh , how can I live without her ? T-THORP What is your problem ? No one has died . No one 's been maimed . No money has been lost . She noosed you . She shuttled you . She broke your heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I loved her . I lover her . I 'm loving her still . T-THORP Fine . You loved her . Good . Go love somebody else . T-THORP There 's no one else I can love . T-THORP Yo , yo , yo ! Wake up ! Love is cheaper than free . It grows all over your feet like yellow fungus in tent town . It drops like acid rain from the sky . Just go outside and open your mouth . Let it fall down your throat and burn up your insides . Aah . What do you think love is ? Why , it 's nothing more than an archaic form of egotism . A tawdry reflection of all the holes in your own shredded soul . Be a human being . Forget about love . T-THORP You 're a monster . T-THORP Rumba ! ( The TVP television phone starts bleeping . L-Tip appears on the TVP screen . She is a tall , striking woman in her thirties . She is dressed in an array of ghastly colored flowers . Strange antennas poke out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is looking at it , trying to get the picture of Boswell to click in . ) T-THORP ( On the screen . ) Box ? Are you there ? Boswell , puppetto ? I 'm below , are you there ? p. 6 T-THORP It 's her . Oh my God . It 's her . She 's there . My beloved . T-THORP ( On screen , waving two Day-glo tickets . ) I got us floor one chase passes . I pulled every pony I knew , but we 're on the main rug . Hello ? T-THORP She 's going with you ? She 's escorting you to the great suckathon ? T-THORP Shut up . ( Talking into his TVP remote . ) I 'm here , L-Tip . T-THORP ( On the screen . ) I ca n't see you on my TVP screen . Click in . T-THORP I want to surprise you with my outfit . T-THORP Traitor . Hoodlum . T-THORP Nick off . T-THORP ( On the screen . ) Yeah ? Well , what do you think of my outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Pansy Martin . Watch this . ( She does an impersonation of Pansy Martin the Fantasy Puppet . ) " I just love t'eat my platter of tulips in the morning dew . Jacka , jacka , jacka ! " ( L-Tip drops character . ) I make a good Pansy Martin , do n't I ? T-THORP Brill , dear . T-THORP ( On the screen . ) Oh , you reindeer you ! p. 7 T-THORP Look , I 'll be right down . T-THORP ( On the screen . ) Well , click , click , Box . We got ta go slide , spill , splatter , and burn ! It 's suck time . Jacka , jacka , jacka ! ( L-Tip starts putting in some ear fuel . Boswell clicks L-Tip off the screen . There is a moment of silence . ) T-THORP ( Stricken . ) She knows how to put on a front . You would n't know she was suffering . Unless you knew her very well , you might not be able to perceive it . T-THORP I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Celebrity Chase ? T-THORP She 's my manager . That 's all . You know that . T-THORP She 's a rotten manager . you 're her only client . You never work . You should fire her . I wish you would Boz . I wish you would fire her . T-THORP Maybe . I 'll give it some thought . She does look ridiculous . ( Boswell exits . ) T-THORP ( To William . ) I did n't think she looked ridiculous . Did you ? SMIT No . But the real Pansy Martin has pansy eyes and there are real flowers growing from her ears . Different kinds . All different kinds . p. 8 T-THORP The real Pansy Martin is a Fantasy Puppet . L-Tip 's a person . SMIT Righto . T-THORP I do n't know . It 's a problem . She 's going to beg me to come back . And I do n't want to be hard-hearted . But she has to see . I mean , there are certain consequences she should face . She baked her cake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . I wo n't just come crawling back . That 's not how thing work . Not on my screen . ( As the lights fade to black , we hear the clatter , conversation , music , etc. , of a strange cocktail party . On the TVP screen we see askew images of a decadent party. ) p. 9 Act 1 , Scene 2 SCENE II Boswell 's apartment . Later that same night . William wears a green union suit . She lies on her mat . L-Tip and Boswell are heard coming up the stairway . The cocktail party noises begin to fade . The following scene is played fast . T-THORP ( Offstage . ) Doomed . I always thought you meant that we were doomed ! Completely doomed . T-THORP ( Offstage . ) That 's general misconception . ( Boswell and L-Tip enter . They bring in an air of exhilaration . They have been to a big party . They have been doing drugs . ) T-THORP You see , to me , Boxdom translated : boxed in , cornered , trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings  --  T-THORP No , no , no . The whole thesis is that one may put a box around anything : a circle , a rectangle , a triangle , a moving spill ! If only the box is big enough , everything will fit . It 's all so  --  so freeing ! T-THORP Yes . Exactly . Yes . God , you are so brill . You make me sin , and sin and sin . Have one more vial . ( She produces two vials of a red liquid . Boswell takes one of the vials . ) T-THORP It would all be so apparent , if only you could have seen the original Boxdom poster . The lasomicrograph is simply not the same . It does n't grasp the colors , the size , the shape . In the original , you could comprehendit was all apparent . p. 10 T-THORP It must have been an awful big dose when your great poster was destroyed . T-THORP Actually , in some ways , I reveled in it . Me and Wanda stood on a balcony across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ribbons . We were eating lemon snaps and drinking dirty water . She was crying . It was laughing in the face of it . Slinging lemon snaps up into the air . ( He demonstrates . ) " Ho ! Ho ! " That 's how I was back then . Very ebullient . T-THORP And it did . It all turned around . The Opposition was overthrown . The No Good Solution Party came to power . You were awarded the Grand Poster Prize . Boxdom became a phenomenon . T-THORP I was very confident . People were always seeking me out for appointments and dinners . Funny , so many people have forgotten all about it . T-THORP There were several members of the old Guard who came up to you this evening . One of them gave you the Box Salute . T-THORP ( Doing a Box Salute . ) Yes , yes . T-THORP And the little , pasty man serving decorative crackers , he asked for your autograph . T-THORP God , what a pathetically hollow practice that is. p. 11 T-THORP Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-THORP No , Not the lady I swiped with my boxed hairdo ? T-THORP Yes , I spoke to her quite a while , all about you . T-THORP Me ? T-THORP Yes . She has her own channel . T-THORP That woman with the rubber nose has her own channel ? T-THORP It 's on the Rehab Circuit . T-THORP Oh . T-THORP But she 's got good time slots . And I think  --  Well , she seemed very interested in having you on one of her shows . T-THORP Me ? T-THORP Yes ! T-THORP Which show ? T-THORP The  --  well , it 's called " The Whatever Happened To Show . " T-THORP " Whatever happened to ? " T-THORP Yes ! They do very few celebrities ! In fact , you 'd be the only one on the show your week . T-THORP I  --  I 'm ill . This is an insult . Why , I 'm not some out-fad Fantasy Puppet . I 'm an art philosopher . What more do they want from me ? ! p. 12 T-THORP They want you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! T-THORP Look , I know what you 're done . But you 've been out of orbit for a very long time . Things change . T-THORP I ca n't stomach it . Look who the Big Splash of the season is . That newcomer , K.Y. Von Ludwig . Him with his loathsome octagons and zigzags . He 'd better hope he makes his mark before his hairdo unglues , the smug little toast . T-THORP Hey , now try not to unzap . T-THORP I should have answered my fan mail ; I should have consorted with celebrity swine ; I should have been a grinning , glad-handing salt lick for the press . T-THORP ( Giving him a blue dot . ) Here , lap a blue dot . T-THORP ( Lapping up the blue dot . ) So what else  --  who else would  --  would be on the show ? T-THORP Oh , well , let 's see . ( She produces a list . ) We got : whatever happened to a clear blue sky , good clean fun , a day at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-gravity gowns : micro pets , the downfall of capitalism , the coalition of fetuses , vulture hairdos , and things that last . p. 13 T-THORP How much do they pay ? T-THORP Scale . T-THORP When do they want me on the show ? T-THORP Well , two weeks from Thursday . I mean  --  if  --  well . There 's one thing . T-THORP What ? T-THORP You 're kind of an alternate . You and " vulture hairdos " are alternates , in case any of the other stories drop out . But they always do . Always it happens . T-THORP Let me got this flat . I 'm an alternate on " The Whatever Happened To Show ? " T-THORP Well , for now temporarily . T-THORP Maybe I 'll just call the Euthanasia Hot Line . T-THORP Please , try to be up . Up is in . T-THORP ( Walking over to the TVP . ) They do it for free now . Government dole . Of course , I hear the paperwork 's appalling . T-THORP You know they have this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permanent smile . They say smiling twenty-four hours a day does wonders for your emotional health , as well as your appearance . T-THORP May be you have n't grasped this , L-Tip , but I 'm nicked , I 'm busted , my plastic is pulp . I do n't have money for fucking smile surgery . p. 14 T-THORP Alright . Relax . That 's what I 'm here to remedy . Here , I 'll turn on the galaxy satellite . There 's supposed to be  --  ( She turns on the G.S . The screen lights up with a glorious view of the night 's sky . ) Oh , look . There it is . The moon . A full moon . T-THORP A cloud 's passing over . T-THORP There 's the Big Dipper . T-THORP A band of stars . T-THORP The Milky Way . T-THORP Luminous . T-THORP Boswell ? T-THORP Yes ? T-THORP Are you available for sex ? T-THORP Umno . I 'm under surveillance . T-THORP Oh . I did n't know . So sorry . T-THORP Nothing 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Well , if you get a launch window , let me know . T-THORP Sure . I 'm sure I will , very soon . T-THORP Sin . T-THORP What about Max ? T-THORP I 've made an appointment with Video Divorce for this Saturday . That 'll be the end of it . p. 15 T-THORP Umm . Regrettable . T-THORP Yes . But he just  --  and we were  --  anyway , things do n't always T-THORP Yes . T-THORP I have all these  --  and with him I never could  --  T-THORP No . T-THORP Great moon . And stars . Always up there , right ? T-THORP I suppose . T-THORP Late . Better go . T-THORP Good night . T-THORP I 'll let you know about the show . Shine on , Boxey . Jacka , jacka , jacka . ( She exits . Boswell stares up at the stars . William sits up in bed . ) SMIT Hello . T-THORP Hi . SMIT Can I mix you your concoction ? T-THORP Yes . ( William gets up and goes to mix Boswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  at the party ? What kinda food did they serve to eat ? T-THORP I do n't really recall . SMIT Was it pretty food ? p. 16 T-THORP I suppose . SMIT Tell me about it . T-THORP I 'm really not interested . SMIT Here 's your concoction . T-THORP Thanks . ( Boswell drinks the concoction . ) SMIT I 'm sure it will make you well . I know it will . It 's very good for you . ( Boswell hands her back he glass . She sets the glass down , then goes to her mat and sits down , hugging herself with arms . Boswell has settled down on his own mat . He looks up at the stars , looks up at her , look back to the stars . ) T-THORP Why are you hugging yourself ? SMIT Just ' cause I  --  just am . T-THORP You  --  SMIT Huh ? T-THORP Umm . SMIT ( Softly . ) Can I ? ( Boswell gives a nearly imperceivable nod . William moves over to his mat . Boswell keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She folds her arms . They do not touch . ) T-THORP There were pink bubble shrimp served on a lavender platter surrounded by electric oysters . There was a marvelous blue dot dip , a crouton tray , some rainbow cheese balls garnished with yellow sea clover , sizzling clay steaks on a fried and refried tray , succulent duck bills p. 17 ( As Boswell talks , William slowly leans over and sets her head on his shoulder . The lights fade . Street noises come up . We hear the sound of wind and trash being blown down alleyways . Strange animals are howling. ) p. 18 Act 1 , Scene 3 SCENE III The lights fade up on the stoop in front of L-Tips 's apartment building . It is later that same night . There are two filthy , ragged homeless people sleeping out on the streets ( Reader and C-Boy . ) They stay huddled under their rags throughout the following scene . L-Tip enters . She starts up the stoop . Max steps out of the shadows . His face is pale and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I just want you to tell me . About my fingers . What am I  --  I mean  --  my fingers ? T-THORP I 'm not  --  I wo n't  --  T-THORP These fingers on my hands . They 're part of me , and yet they know where you dream . They 've been all over you , journeyed through you and up you and in you . I can never change where they have traveled . T-THORP There are parts of me  --  parts of my life , that have nothing to do with you . T-THORP So you 're just walking on . Walking right on over me . Stepping on my forehead with your highest heel . Impaling my heart with your red spiked shoe . Go on . I do n't mind . I wo n't even squirm . Just please do n't  --  please do n't make that call . T-THORP It 's over . p. 19 T-THORP Nothing is over . You know , nothing is over . T-THORP It is . T-THORP No . Not when I am willing to do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scream out your name . Lie down like a dog and let you kick in my brains . Or crawl , I will crawl ; I will crawl at your feet . ( He gets down on all fours and starts crawling to her . ) Yes , I know , it 's always better to kick someone who has risen to all fours than to pummel away at a motionless supine target . Come on . Kick me . I 'm crawling . Kick in my gums , my lips , my face  --  whatever you want . Whatever you want . ( He crawls up to her and starts climbing up her legs . She kicks and shoves him away . ) T-THORP ( Overlapping . ) Get away . Leave me . There is nothing I want from you . There is not one thing that belongs to you that I would have . Not a notion , not a smile , not the time of day , or a cut of gum . ( She stops kicking him . ) He looks up at her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Please . This is not the way I normally behave . This is not who I am . I ca n't  --  I have never  --  And it iskilling me . I wish , for both our sakes , I wish I was dead . p. 20 ( Max gets up and exits . L-Tip looks after him . She clutches her arms around herself and leans against the stoop ; garbage whirls around her . There is the sound of rushing water and wind . The lights fade. ) p. 21 Act 1 , Scene 4 SCENE IV The lights fade up on Boswell 's apartment . The sound of a shower is heard from behind the lavatory door . It is night . William stands at attention before the TVP screen . She wears her orange splatter pants over her green long johns . She wears a crisp white bow tie around her neck , white gloves , a white visor , and spotless white shoes . She is talking to an Official on the TVP screen . William speaks into the TVP remote . OFFICIAL ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rescue tab , par X ; attitude par X ; 129 O.T . hours . " You could be headed for the W.Y. Badge . SMIT Thank you , sire . I intend to get it .

The one about the beautiful girl who are the toxic apple given to her by the evil queen ? I  --  ( The screen flickers with zigzags , then goes dark . ) SMIT Oh , oh . Good-bye , Tabell . Bonnie . Good-bye . p. 23 ( William puts down the TVP remote . She carefully begins removing her whites and placing them into the pristine box where they are kept . The water stops running in the bathroom . The front doorbell buzzes , then we hear Max 's voice over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door speaker . ) Hello . This is Max . I stopped by . ( William clicks Max in with the laser remote . Max enters . He is pale and sweaty . His clothes are rumpled and dirty . ) SMIT Hello . T-THORP Hi . Where 's Boswell ? SMIT ( Indicating the lavatory . ) In there . He 's washing . T-THORP I need to discuss something . A matter . With him . You 're William , right ? SMIT Yeah . T-THORP They bring you in from the CTZ ? SMIT Yes . T-THORP They still got sheep there ? SMIT Uh-huh . T-THORP I remember sheep . Wool trousers , lamb chops , bah , bah , bah ? They got you working down on the shore ? SMIT Uh-huh . p. 24 T-THORP You Quake , Spill , Burn , or Splatter Crew ? SMIT Splatter . T-THORP Big mess , all that . Hard to contain . A real job for somebody . SMIT I do my best .

T-THORP From me ? From me ? T-THORP You 're my brother . I thought I 'd ask . T-THORP Look , I borrow from you . You do n't borrow from me . You 're the steady one . You earn the living . You know how that 's done . p. 25 T-THORP I 've been fired , noosed , chucked ! They let me go ! T-THORP For God 's sake , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-THORP She did it . It 's her fault . She divorced me . T-THORP Be that as it may , I have to eat my dinner . T-THORP Please , help me . I 'm homeless . I could use anything . A tin cup . A cardboard box . T-THORP I do n't want to . I do n't have any time . You have to go . T-THORP Is it because of the monkey ? It is . Is n't it ? T-THORP What ? T-THORP Our stuffed monkey , Mr. Yips . The one our father micro-charred , all because you would n't stop sucking your fingers . These two fingers here . He warned you . But you loved slurping them so much , you caused the torture death of our beloved Mr. Yips . That 's why you hate me . Because I know you for the finger-slurping monkey killer you really are . ( The brothers glare at each other for several horrible moments . Then Boswell turns very slowly and deliberately to William . ) T-THORP William , what am I having for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits in a heartbroken fury . ) T-THORP I posed a question . SMIT Deluxe Banquet Festival . T-THORP I 'm ready to eat . SMIT Alright . ( William goes to the micro-meal machine . She punches a button . ) T-THORP What are you having ? SMIT Dotted broccoli . ( Two micro meals come out , with disposable silverware and napkins included . ) T-THORP Do n't you ever get sick of dotted broccoli ? SMIT I like broccoli . T-THORP But you have it repeatedly . SMIT Sometimes I 'll vary . I have cauliflower , or brocflower , or flowercauli . T-THORP Never a dull moment with you . SMIT Every Sunday I have a sausage . T-THORP I 've seen that sausage you eat . It 's a pitiful sausage . A sad little parsley sausage . SMIT ( Maintaining her dignity . ) I enjoy my sausage . T-THORP I suppose it 's all you can afford . You do the best with what you have . In a certain sense , you 're to be applauded . Here , have a tomato . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , William . I know how much you like tomatoes . Go on , take it . SMIT I do n't feel like a tomato .

For God 's sake , take the tomato ! I 'm begging you , please , now , please . SMIT I 'll take it . ( William takes the tomato . ) T-THORP Fine . I just happen to know you like them . That 's all . How was your day ? Let 's hear about your day . ( Quietly , desperate . ) I 'd like for you to talk . SMIT Well , there was this sea lamb in the tubs out at the rescue center . Her eyes were sick and yellow and she was all covered in thick , black splatter . I put on my mask and gloves and started combing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scraped and tugged . It was tough going . Her eyes were frightened . This was a new experience for her . This furball remover procedure . But , eventually , I was able to scrape off most of the splat , and underneath I could see her skin was pink . A powder pink . I felt accomplishment , seeing that clean skin . It was a good day 's work . p. 28 T-THORP A good day 's work . My , how I 've come to envy you , William . You with your non-skilled job . Picking lethal stickem off of dying plants and beasts . A mindless job , unglamorous , unrewarding , unbearably dull and useless . SMIT Some are saved . T-THORP Saved ? Saved for what ? A miserable life in a filth-ridden world . One percent of one splatter is cleaned up before there is a whole new splat out . You save a thimbleful of sand on a blackened beach . You sit a legless dancer at a harp with no strings . Good work . Well done . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got the Final Report today . SMIT ( A beat . ) What did it say ? T-THORP It was unanimous . SMIT Oh . T-THORP Um . SMIT Does that mean ? T-THORP Yes .

I do n't want you to die . To leave . You 'll be gone . And I got to see you . Every day I got to see you . Oh , where will they take you when you have died ? Where will you be ? I do n't want you to be there . It 's too far . T-THORP Oblivion . I 'll be in oblivion , where I 'm sure I 'll be perfectly dead and wo n't be plagued with any cares or woes .

The chaotic sounds fade . T-THORP L.A. has changed . I ca n't quite put my finger on it , but things are different . Things are  --  not so good . You may not realize all this . You 're sitting pretty . You get a government food box every day . What 'd you get in there this time ? Any Fig Bolts ? You get a Fig Bolt ?

He reads one of them to himself . ) ( L-Tip appears at the top of the stoop , carrying an air contraption . She is scantily clad and is perspiring heavily because of the relentless heat . There are green stripes painted up the back of her legs . ) T-THORP Hi . p. 32 T-THORP Hi . T-THORP Hot day . T-THORP Yes . T-THORP Here 's the air contraption . T-THORP Thanks . T-THORP I do n't know how you 're going to use it . You do n't have a home . T-THORP It 's part of the settlement . T-THORP Right . ( She turns to go . ) T-THORP ( Sincerely . ) Hey , I was wondering ? T-THORP What ? T-THORP ( Kindly . ) Just  --  How are things with you ? T-THORP Sin , really sin . I 've got five new clients . And I 'm right on the verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's the Big Splash of the season , you know . T-THORP So what makes you think he 'll go with you ? T-THORP You probably do n't realize this , Max , but I 'm starting to make a real name for myself around this town . People are calling me " L-Tip the Hip Lip . " I 'm really dishing up . T-THORP Hmm . So this Von Ludwig 's impressed with you ? p. 33 T-THORP Yeah . T-THORP Oh , then he does n't realize you 're really a nobody . I mean , in the scheme of things . In this town . T-THORP He thinks I 'm sin . T-THORP Oh . What about you does he think is sin ? T-THORP The green stripes I paint up the back of my legs . The ones you said were trash class . He says they suit me . He says I have legs like trees . Wilderness legs , he calls me . T-THORP What are you saying ? Are you pogoing this toast ? You out there hawking yourself like meat wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at you . You 're curling up with jeally and you got no track . T-THORP Hey , I 'm not jeally . Not me . I 'm not the type . And do n't you zap labels on me . Do n't zoom price tags on my forehead . T-THORP Chuck you . ( She starts up the steps . ) T-THORP Hey , L-Tip . There 's one thing I forgot to tell you . There 's one big thing I lied about . Our whole marriage I told end big lie . T-THORP What ? T-THORP You are fat . You 're a pig . Your things are pure blubber . p. 34 T-THORP Bastard . You bastard . ( She exits up the stairs . ) T-THORP I knew that would cut her to the quick . Calling her a pig . That was a good one . It got her . It made an impression . I do n't really need the air contraption . It was just an excuse to see her . To make some headway . I wanted to read her my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , why did I call her a pig ? What a mistake . What a misguided blunder ! ( He slaps himself in the face . ) What now ? What now ? I guess , I 'll just  --  have to  --  grip on . Right . That 's all . Grip on . Next time it will go better . Next time I 'll do things right . Next time I 'll be the way I should have been now . p. 35 Act 1 , Scene 6 SCENE VI ( Boswell 's apartment . Late afternoon . Boswell is anxiously sorting through a box of memorabilia . He is bare-chested . Grey sores are visible on his chest . William sits on her mat . She wears her splatter suit and helmet . She is cleaning black spill off of a strange creature with a wire brush . ) T-THORP ( To himself . ) Very good . Very good . I must display important items from my memorabilia box . L-Tip will need to be familiarized with all facets of my career . ( Holding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a request for my autograph . ( Grandly . ) Someone once wanted a copy of my signature . ( There is a loud buzz . ) T-THORP L-Tip ! Darling , please enter . T-THORP ( Over loudspeaker . ) It 's Jennifer . T-THORP Who ? T-THORP ( Over loudspeaker . ) Jennifer T-Thorp . One of your daughters . The middle one . T-THORP Shit . One of my swarmy brats . ( Boswell turns on the TVP . Jennifer , eight , appears on the screen . She wears a kerchief on her head and holds a Blue Dot Cactus . ) T-THORP What do you want ? p. 36 T-THORP ( On the screen . ) I brought you a Blue Dot Cactus . Mum said you would like it . T-THORP Oh , how sug . No doubt you read about my condition in the Up And Coming Obits . T-THORP ( On the screen . ) Yes , we did . Can I come bring it up to you ? T-THORP No . Just put it in the laser box . T-THORP ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boswell clicks her off the screen . ) T-THORP I 'm sorry but I simply do n't have time . After all I am someone whose face has been on a button . ( He holds up a square button with his face on it . A Blue Dot Cactus appears in the laser tray . ) Oh , very good , here it is . A Blue Dot Cactus . At one time Wanda and I had a whole garden of Blue Dot Cacti . Poor Wanda . She does n't realize how I 've grown . ( He picks up the cactus . ) I do n't want this . I 'm throwing it away . ( William lifts her face guard . ) SMIT Could I have it ? ( Boswell glares at her then throws the plant into the receptacle . ) T-THORP It 's in the receptacle . Now get your clap back down . I 've told you I can no longer tolerate the sight of your face . p. 37 ( William lowers her face guard . ) T-THORP I do not like looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animal . ) T-THORP And another thing . I 'm getting sick of you bringing in these wretched creatures . Picking away at them all through the night . SMIT I want to get selected Worker of the Year . T-THORP God , how pathetic to live a life where every bone is a treasure . SMIT If I get the W.Y. badge , I 'll be allowed a quarter cubicle . Then I 'll be able to start the defrost on my kids . T-THORP Forget about those kids . You do n't know how lucky you are they 've got them on ice . ( L-Tip 's voice is heard over the door speaker . ) T-THORP ( Through the door speaker . ) Boswell ? Hi . Hi . It 's L-Tip . T-THORP Darling , darling , darling . Entree . Entree . ( Boswell clicks in L-Tip . ) ( L-Tip enters looking more trendy and today than ever . She wears a dress decorated with packages of food and drug vials . She is uncomfortable visiting her dying friend . ) T-THORP Boswell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . p. 38 T-THORP Yes , and you 're looking even more , more than ever . T-THORP ( About her dress . ) Is n't it sin ? It 's a fuel frock . Saves all sorts of time . You never have to stop for meals . ( Offering him food off of the dress . ) Here , are you hungry ? T-THORP No thanks . T-THORP Save it for later . I mean , well , soon later . T-THORP Listen , L-Tip , I do n't want your Fig Bolt , but I do have a proposal to make to you as my manager . T-THORP Whatever you want . Whatever I can do . ( Offering him grapes from her dress . ) Sure you  --  T-THORP No . T-THORP ( Eating the grapes . ) I missed lunch . T-THORP I just thought , in light of my present  --  state . That perhaps we could organize a salute to Boxdom . Something along the line of a Grand Memorial Dinner . Charge , say , two thousand K per tic . Get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laser lead could read " Come See Box Before He 's Boxed . " I like that . It 's thematic , yet wittyWhat are you thinking ? T-THORP Hmm . I do n't know . It 's the future . Boxdom is way-out fad . It has n't got any bite for today 's market . p. 39 T-THORP No bite ? I 'm talking about handing you a dying artist 's retrospective with the dying artist in tow , and you 're telling me there 's no bite ? T-THORP If only you had n't stopped so abruptly at the Box Theory . If only you 'd done something more . T-THORP Yes , well , due to my remarkable intelligence , I realized early on this world was not an oyster I wanted to try and swallow . Thus I went on to other things . Like maintaining an image which was a vital part of securing government subsidy . I made replica posters , sold souvenir boxes . I did that ad for box perfumeBut I do n't have to stand here and sell myself to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used me to worm her way into the Celebrity Chase . We went in there to get me work , me ! Instead , you come out with five new clients , while I 'm still standing here surrounded by the smell of zed . T-THORP Believe me , Boz . I 've tried every sin in the book to got a job in Hollywood  --  T-THORP I 'm not asking for a job . I 'm asking for a dinner . T-THORP Do n't you understand , it 's trash class to give a Grand Memorial Dinner for yourself before you 're really even dosed . T-THORP Fine , fine . We 'll just wait till I 'm all dosed out , so we can leave it up to you to make me look good . You who have the infallible fashion sense to parade around town dressed up like a fucking Bee Jam 's Supermarket . ( He rips food off of her frock. ) p. 40 T-THORP Hey , those are mine . T-THORP Goo Goo Pops , indeed ! T-THORP You got no track ! T-THORP You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Boswell exits . ) T-THORP ( Yelling after him . ) Yeah ! Oh , yeah ? ! Yeah ! Ding-a-roo . Look , he tore off my snacks . I do n't have to take this anymore . I got clients . I 'm a professional woman . All my dreams are coming true . SMIT He thinks he 's some big , fat bing . Well , he 's not . If you wan na know the truth , before I moved in here , I never even heard of Boxdom . T-THORP Oh , it had its day . It lived for about as long as a fish can breathe in cement . But it 's over , it 's zapped , it 's glue rot . He 's not in step . I 've got this theory . I 've developed it . SMIT Yeah ? T-THORP Trend is life . SMIT Yeah ? T-THORP If you 're doing what 's doing now , at least you know you 're doing something . Even if it 's stupid and fleeting , dangerous and dull , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing you are participating in an era . Have some Red Dogs . p. 41 ( L-Tip hands William some Red Dogs . Throughout the following , they eat and drink from L-Tip 's dress . ) SMIT Thanks . T-THORP Before I had this theory , I was n't anybody . All I knew about myself was I was in my thirties , I was Max 's wife , I worked at a noodle stand , and Chee Chee Kitty was my favorite Fantasy Puppet . I had all the Chee Chee Kitty fashion attire , laser dots , kitchen equipment , toiletries . SMIT Moe Zoe Beam is my favorite Fantasy Puppet . But I do n't have any of his stuff . T-THORP The thing is , all that stuff does n't make you happy , ' cause you 're still sitting on the sidelines . I ultimately realized , what I really wanted to be doing was all the things the real Chee Chee Kitty was doing on Celeb Bites  --  wearing outfits made of sugar stars lapping up the limelight , dancing at Cafe Who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , I decided to turn my life around and become a manager . SMIT You just decided ? T-THORP With every hair on my flesh . It thrills me knowing what I want going out and getting it , taking it , swallowing it whole , wiping my lips and coming back for more . Mmm . ( L-Tip wipes her lips with her hand . William imitates her . ) SMIT Mmm . p. 42 T-THORP Ya got ta slurp up the stars . That 's why they 're up in the sky . SMIT Go . I feel like a puff next to you . T-THORP ( Showing her finger with a big laser ring on it . ) Tomorrow I 'm marrying K.Y. Von Ludwig , the Big Splash of the season . SMIT Ding-a-roo . I saw his picture . He 's dish . T-THORP Oh yeah , he 's been on the front of five zill videozines this month . He 's the Big Splash . I mean , he is unbearably conceited and self-sucking . But I do n't think he can help that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't expect my marriage to work out . It 's more like a career move . I 'll do anything to get out ahead . ' Cause that 's what I believe in . I mean , you got ta believe in something , right ? Otherwise , what 's the point ? ( There is a loud banging at the door . Max 's voice comes over the loudspeaker . ) T-THORP ( Over speaker . ) L-Tip , I know you 're in there . They told me you 're in there . Open this door . Open this fucking door ! SMIT ( Overlapping . ) It 's Max . He sounds like he 's detonating . T-THORP Click me in ! Now , for fuck 's sake ! Now ! Click me in ! ( He continues banging. ) p. 43 T-THORP ( Overlapping . ) I 'll click him in . I 'll show him what for . Calling me a pig . Come on , you bastard . ( L-Tip crawls to the remote and clicks Max in . Max enters . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried on his face and on his dirty garments . ) T-THORP You gon na marry that fuck ? T-THORP Yeah , I am . T-THORP But do you love him ? You love that fuck ? You think you 're in love with him ? It 's  --  true love ? T-THORP Yes . T-THORP You do ? You love that fucking fuck ? T-THORP Yes . T-THORP More than me ? T-THORP Oh , yes . T-THORP But you did love me ? At one time ? You did ? T-THORP I guess . I suppose . T-THORP But you stopped . It ended . You stopped loving me . Why did you stop ? What made you stop ? What ? I  --  Look , I 've written poems for you . ( He pulls out endless poems , all crumpled and dirty , from his pockets , shirt , shoes , etc . ) All these poems . Love poems . Passion notes , erotica . And these ! And this ! And that ! p. 44 T-THORP What ? What ? I do n't want these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You held its fluttering wings in your hands and crushed it slowly to death . Now you hold up its breathless body , look at it and say you 're very , very sad . T-THORP I did n't  --  I would n't crush  --  No  --  Untrue . T-THORP Yeah , well , the whole time we were together you never stopped pogoing every woman who ever gave you change . T-THORP You 're the only one I loved . T-THORP Go . You did n't even know me . You thought you were married to Chee Chee Kitty . Remember how I always had to make those kitty whispers ? T-THORP I thought you liked that . T-THORP I thought I did , too . We were both wrong . I 'm leaving . ( She gathers herself together and heads for the door . ) T-THORP Please , tell me , I do n't understand . What 's happened to our love ? Fourteen years of love . We were each other 's lives . Can all that be wiped clean like dust across piano keys , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other speechlessly for several deafening moments of silence . Then L-Tip exits . Max starts to breathe heavily . ) SMIT You 're bleeding . p. 45 T-THORP I  --  Yes , I was hit by something . It was dropped on my head as I was walking down the street . A boulder , a Dr. Pop bottle , I do n't know what ? Something that could kill you . SMIT Did you hear the news ? About M. Boswell ? T-THORP Oh , yes , has n't he always been the lucky one . SMIT I do n't think it 's lucky . T-THORP Maybe then you have something to live for . SMIT Sure . I do . I want a home to live in and I want my kids out of F.D. Then I want us all to learn to read and write and clap to music . T-THORP May I use your TVP ? SMIT Uh-huh . ( Max goes to the TVP screen . Max 's click goes through on the TVP . An amiable woman dressed in white surrounded by pink carnations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TVP screen . ) Hello . Euthanasia Hot line . May I help you ? T-THORP ( Into TVP . ) Yes . This is Maxwell T-Thorp . I want to be euthed . WOMAN ( On the TVP screen . ) So you 're calling to euth yourself , not a friend or relative . p. 46 T-THORP ( Into TVP . ) Yes . Correct . WOMAN ( On the TVP screen . ) Very well . If you 'll just hold on a minute , I 'll transfer you to the P.W . Department and we 'll get started on your paperwork . ( Happy cartoons of people dying peacefully come up on the screen , as Max is put on hold . ) SMIT Max , do n't . Click off . Do n't . T-THORP I can no longer live caked in this awful pain . ( A rosy , pink man appears on the TVP screen . He sits behind a computer . ) PINK MAN ( On the TVP screen . ) Hello . M. Maxwell T-Thorp ?

She clutches her right breast . It throbs with a painful longing , a longing for Boswell . ) READER Oh . God . Oh . God . Boswell . Boswell T-Thorp . Boswell . How long till you are mine ? How long ?

Her tears are light blue in color . ) T-THORP L-Tip , I did n't know you felt this way . T-THORP Oh , I do n't . It 's my hormones . They 're the ones with feelings . As soon as they open up this spoon store , I 'll fix it all out . ( She cries some more . ) T-THORP I ca n't help it . I love to watch you cry . You 're the only one I 've ever known who cries blue tears . Remember how I used to pinch and scare you just to see you cry blue tears . p. 65 T-THORP Yeah . Well , too bad it does n't earn me any K.

Time ? T-THORP ( Showing her his watch . ) Close . T-THORP ( Looking at his watch . ) Close . ( As the lights fade , we hear the sound of a clock ticking. ) p. 66 Act 2 , Scene 4 SCENE IV The Boardwalk . The sound of a clock ticking continues . Reader is at her box . Her hair and braid are neatly braided with a pink ribbon . She wears a sleeveless blouse . Incredible , long , black hair grows from her armpits . This hair is also neatly braided and tied with pink ribbon . She strokes her lips with the tip of this hair . She is waiting expectantly . The ocean roars . Sea birds squawk . Offshore machinery rumbles in the distance . The sound of a clock ticking starts to fade as Boswell appears . He is walking with a cane . He is distracted yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spots Reader and waves the sheet at her . T-THORP Ah ho ! You were right . You knew . Pickles . Yes , pickles . It is coming to me for the first time in all this time . A torrential outpouring of creative bliss . I 'm calling it , " Death and a Jar of Pickles . " Compared to this Boxdom is nothing more than puerile dribble . Why , if I can capture this poster , if it is fully grasped , it may be all we ever need to know . Finished ! Done ! Complete ! ! READER You have n't said anything about my hair . T-THORP Oh . No . Well , yes , I see . Now , about these pickles . These universal pickles ; these monolithic pickles  --  they 're just swimming and soaking in a sea of wretched , godless juices . p. 67 READER Let me see the writing . Where 's the writing ? T-THORP ( Handing over the pages . ) Yes , of course . Pickle , pickle pickle . READER ( Looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . T-THORP What ? READER You 're not whole . You 're incomplete . Something is missing . T-THORP What ? What could be missing ? I have my pickles . My poster . When it is complete , I 'll have something to display . My masterpiece . I can hold it up to the whole world . READER And who will hold you back ? T-THORP Everyone . Everyone will be awed and amazed . READER Who will hold the real one ? The one that feels and stinks and eats and ca n't sleep and gets so frightened by , by , by , by rainstorms and unpleasant faces and sores that do n't heal in the cracks of his hands . T-THORP What do you want from me ? You know my condition . It 's too late for all that . I have to be reasonable . READER Maybe it 's time for you to blow your nose on the sleeve of reason . Go past the numbness , tear off the layers of fear and self-loathing , look at the pain , stick your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , weak , watery eyes . Let your blood howl. p. 68 T-THORP I do n't know what you mean . Such nonsense . Just tell me what to write and it will be written . READER Feel my orbs . T-THORP What ? READER Both of them . Feel both of them . ( Boswell feels her breasts with his hands . ) T-THORP ( With his hands on her breasts . ) There . Now please , you must tell me what to write . What do I write ? READER People . T-THORP Yes ? READER People come through the trees and look into your eyes . You stop them walking toward you . You stand still and shut your eyes . T-THORP ( Averting his eyes and removing his hands from her breasts . ) I do n't know that I do that . READER You do . ( Boswell looks at his hands . They are stained with blood and mud and milk . ) READER What 's that on your hands ? T-THORP I  --  do n't know . READER Look at it . T-THORP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's red and black ink stains . READER Where 'd it come from ? T-THORP From a pen in my pocket . Tell me what to write . READER You tell me . Where did it come from ? Who does it belong to ? It does n't smell like ink . T-THORP Tell me what to write . Tell me . I 'm telling you . If you can you should tell me now . ( He grabs her by the throat . ) Because I can not go away empty-handed . READER Write the name of your beloved . T-THORP I do n't have a beloved . READER Write it one hundred times . ( He lets her go . She gasps for air . ) READER Where did it come from ? Who does it belong to ? It does n't smell like ink . T-THORP I do n't have a beloved . ( Soul music comes up , as the lights fade. ) p. 70 Act 2 , Scene 5 SCENE V Boswell 's apartment . Later that same day . C-Boy and William are dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of way . William wears a decorated orange splatter suit . They are rehearsing a lip sync routine to a soulful love song filled with joyful longing and a hot beat ; i.e. , Jackie Wilson 's " Lonely Teardrops . " William is struggling to keep up with C-Boy who incredibly is a dancing genius . He is capable of all sorts of fantastic feats . His emaciated body twists and turns like rubber . William attempts to spin into his arms and stumbles . C-Boy , the utter perfectionist , shakes his head dismally . C-BOY ( No , no , no . ) SMIT I 'll get it . C-BOY ( Please observe . ) ( He demonstrates with a flourish . ) SMIT Okay . I see . More like this . ( She tries again . C-Boy nods his head in measured approval . He motions to her to try the step with him . They are in mid-spin when Boswell enters . They stop rehearsing immediately . William rushes to click off the music . ) SMIT Boswell , hello . I thought  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I have to  --  ( He wipes his soiled hands with a rag . ) These modern pens they do n't function . They malfunction . Inconvenient all the mess . p. 71 SMIT We thought you 'd be working on your poster . T-THORP What ? No . I ca n't . It 's been  --  you see there 's no one to write down . I have no beloved . SMIT Well , I 'm sorry . We 'll get out of your way . T-THORP What are you  --  your apparel is strange . SMIT These are our outfits . Tonight we perform in the Spectacular Splat Out Fund Raiser . We 're lip syncing to an antique tune . C-Boy , he made up our whole dance . ( C-Boy beams in a strange , sheepish way . ) T-THORP Dance ? You dance ? SMIT He 's very good . He taught me how . T-THORP How what ? SMIT To dance . T-THORP Dance . SMIT Yes , if you wanted  --  I mean , we could show you . T-THORP Show me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  because I simply do not care for entertainment of any sort . SMIT Yes , well , we should go . T-THORP Alright . Do it . Go ahead . Let me see your dance . I will watch it if I must . p. 72 SMIT Okay . Yes . C-Boy , click it . ( C-Boy clicks on the music and they do their dance . The gist of the dance is a crazed C-Boy begging , pleading , cajoling , and romancing William to come back to him . Boswell watches with gripped amazement . He finds himself totally identifying with the demonic C-Boy who is wholly possessed by William and her relentless joy . The song ends . The dancers stop , then slowly , almost sadly , they both look to Boswell for approval . Boswell sits for a moment stupefied . ) T-THORP I  --  I  --  Stunning . ( He rises to his feet and applauds . ) Stunning . Hear , hear . Remarkable . I  --  hear , hear . SMIT ( Numb with shock . ) You liked it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He liked it . ( William and C-Boy hug each other joyfully . Boswell stands awkwardly alone . ) SMIT Now we do n't have to worry about tonight . Why , if M. Boswell liked it you know everyone else will . Thank you , M. Boswell . Thank you . ( C-Boy salutes Boswell with the Box Salute . ) T-THORP I  --  You 're welcome . SMIT Well , we should go on over . They want us there early . p. 73 ( C-Boy gestures to their faces . ) SMIT Yes , we have to do our makeup . They 're gon na put us in makeup . ( C-Boy and William gather their coats , ears , props , etc. throughout the following . C-Boy communicates to William through pantomime . ) SMIT Now should we wear the rubber noses ? ( C-Boy gives a definite " yes . " ) SMIT Yeah , I think so , too . They 're so zog . Well , ' bye , Boswell , have a good night . T-THORP I  --  when will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  wellHave a good time . SMIT We will . T-THORP Ah , wait a minute . SMIT Yes ? T-THORP Good luck . SMIT ( Stunned and honored . ) Thanks . Thanks a lot , M. Boswell . Thank you . T-THORP Yes . Well . ' Bye . SMIT ' Bye . ( William and C-Boy start to leave . ) T-THORP William ? p. 74 SMIT What ? T-THORP Could I come ? SMIT Sure . Of course . Boswell 's coming . T-THORP I 'll get my coat . SMIT Oh , he 's gon na come see us do our act in person . Boswell 's coming . Is n't it wonderful . He 's coming . This is so wonderful . T-THORP Well , now let 's go . Come on . We do n't have all night . Put on your ears . You know how the temperature drops . ( They all three exit in a flurry . The lights start to fade as the Celeb Bites ' theme music comes up. ) p. 75 Act 2 , Scene 6 SCENE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays . L-Tip is interviewing Max on Celeb Bites . Max wears his charm suit and turban . He looks the perfect lost poet . L-Tip wears a dress made of different colored eyeglasses . She has green eyeglasses painted around her eyes . Her persona is that of the highly sexual intellectual . They both wear heavy makeup . A bright pink light burns down on them . The theme music dies down . L-Tip smiles into the camera . T-THORP Welcome to Celeb Bites . I 'm L-Tip the Hip Lip , your guest host . Tonight we are chewing it up with poet , Maxwell T-Thorp , the man who is going to euth himself for love . Is he a romantic hero or a cowardly imbecile ? Let 's find out . Hello , Max . T-THORP Hello , L-Tip . T-THORP So , tell us , Max , how long do you have ? T-THORP It 's just a matter of completing the paperwork . T-THORP I hear the paperwork 's appalling . T-THORP Yes . Dreadful . It could takewho knows ? T-THORP Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . How did you ever reach this point of desperation ? T-THORP I , well , I met her when we were very young . We went to school together . She 'd sit at her terminal and make little cooing sounds . At recess one day she shared her soyball sandwich with me . Later we were married . I got a job at the Tank Bureau . I had half a cubicle , access to coffee dot , a key to the M. room , all your basic extra features . Then she divorced me . That 's when I discovered , love can kill you . p. 76 T-THORP And yet you sit here looking very zog . Your poems are today 's craze . The laser show 's in the works . I mean , are n't you being peculiarly shorteyed ? Things change very fast in this world . Why , you could find a new love tomorrow . Or perhaps even tonight . T-THORP I do n't think so . You see , I 'm not one of your twenty-first century use and cruisers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel frock . T-THORP Yet could n't it be argued that you are wasting a life that should be cherished by committing this cowardly act of self-aggrandizement ? T-THORP I do n't see that I 'm wasting my life . In fact , just the opposite . Certainly to go on living would be the real coward 's play . But I refuse to desecrate my profound love by adhering to the notion that it can be replaced , or forgotten , or lived without . I believe by dying I 'm tipping my hat to life and the grand effect it can have on the living . T-THORP I 'm sorry to say this but listening to you , I do n't think you have any idea what real love is . Why , if you understood mature love , you would come to love and accept yourself and not degenerate into this destructive , distorted masochistic indulgence . T-THORP Yes , I 'm afraid it 's true . I do n't know what real or mature love is . It 's a mystery to me as I believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I dove into the ocean anyway , having no idea how to swim , and now I 'm going down for the third count and I have no regrets ; the water is green and cool and I would rather be here than standing endlessly alone on the parched , dry shore . p. 77 T-THORP I do n't understand you . You never even treated her that well . This woman . I  --  I 've done my research . And you pogoed around . You always pogoed around . You forgot her birthday eleven times . You ignored her at parties . You complained about the meals she clicked . You tore the arms off her Chee Chee Kitty . T-THORP All the more reason . All the more reason to salvage the remnants of a love I shattered through reckless abuse . T-THORP But there you are again , only thinking of yourself . Why , she would n't want  --  any of this . T-THORP How do you know ? T-THORP I  --  she  --  we 've talked . T-THORP Yes . And what does she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . She  --  She would take you back . If you did not do that . T-THORP But does she ? Is she ? Could she love me still ? T-THORP I  --  do n't know . Things are so different . Everything . T-THORP I ca n't go back without it . Always hoping for its return like sawed off legs that will never grow back . Please . Tell me . What ? T-THORP I  --  How can I ? It 's  --  You 'll have to ask her . p. 78 T-THORP There 's nothing to ask . T-THORP You 're a charlatan . You 're just doing this to sell your book . You 'll call it off before it 's over . ( To the camera . ) M. 's and M. 's that is my prediction . T-THORP I understand your stupidity . You ca n't help it . You do n't know her . The woman , I love . She 's like no one else . She cries blue tears . ( They look at each other silently . We hear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 79 Act 2 , Scene 7 SCENE VII Boswell 's apartment . Night . Boswell walks with a cane . There is a nearly subliminal sound of distant thunder . C-Boy has been showing Boswell how to click a meal . T-THORP So once more , I walk over there  --  ( He indicates the micromachine . ) I punch the top button , the red one , the one that comes first . Then I remove my finger and the meals will appear . ( C-Boy nods . ) T-THORP I want to get this right . ( C-Boy starts to comb Boswell 's hair . ) T-THORP I hope she likes rainbow duck . It 's a delicacy . Perhaps she does n't like delicacies . I do n't know . How should I know ? ( C-Boy stops combing Boswell 's hair . He removes a large hairball from the comb and tosses it into the receptacle . Boswell watches this with fine misery . He feels his thinning hair . ) T-THORP Oh God . Hair is so much more attractive when it stays on the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How do my sores look ? Are they very ugly ? I  --  I should n't be doing this . This is all very silly . I 'm going to change my mind in a minute . I 'd better come to my senses . I 'd better do it fast . ( Boswell exits into the lavatory . C-Boy goes to get his coat and ears . William enters . She wears her splatter suit . She is carrying her helmet and wears a dandy in her hair . ) SMIT C-Boy , hi . I  --  I 'm so glad you 're here . Where is he ! ? p. 80 ( C-Boy motions to the lavatory . ) SMIT He 's clicking dinner for me . Why do you think he 's doing that ? What do you think it means ? ( C-Boy shrugs and heads for the door . ) SMIT Where are you going ? ( C-Boy shows her a pass . ) SMIT Go . The recreation machine . Did he buy you that pass ? ( C-Boy nods . ) SMIT Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see me alone . But why ? What 's going to happen ? Oh , why is he clicking me dinner ? ( C-Boy shrugs and exits . William takes off her orange parka and boots . She puts on her white shoes and fools with the dandy in her hair . She is miserable with anticipation . Boswell comes out of the lavatory . He has sprayed black polish on his head . He walks with his cane . ) T-THORP I do n't know . I do n't know . They should uninvent hair . It 's nothing but a scourge . ( He realizes he is not talking to C-Boy . ) Oh . AhHas C-Boy ? Gone ? SMIT Um . T-THORP Oh . Well . Are you ready for dinner ? SMIT Uh-huh . ( Boswell walks with stiff self-consciousness over to the micromachine . He hesitates a moment , then punches a button . Gravel music plays loudly . ) T-THORP I  --  I  --  that was the wrong button . A mistake has been made . Wait . Wait . p. 81 ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alarm goes off . It rings frantically . He keeps pressing buttons . Finally , the alarm shuts off , the micromachine opens up , the dinners come out burnt and charred . Boswell looks at William with blank helplessness . ) T-THORP I charred our dinners . SMIT Oh , well . T-THORP Dinner is charred . SMIT I have two carrots . T-THORP Carrots . We ca n't be eating carrots . Not when I 'm proposing marriage . SMIT You 're  --  Who ? ( She looks around . ) Me ? T-THORP Yep . SMIT Go . T-THORP Do n't answer . Please , do n't answer . Not until  --  There are  --  I have some reasons . ( He produces a list . ) Number one : If my poster makes a big splash , you could be very rich . Number two : You know my condition ; I wo n't last long ; so even if it is a bad marriage , at least it will be short Number three : You 're already living here anyway . Number four : They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using them , even healthy people . They say the results make nature a thing of the past . This would be so much better if I had n't charred the meals . If the meals were sitting here like I had planned . p. 82 ( There is the sound of thunder approaching . ) T-THORP Oh , my God . A rainstorm . Thunder . I hate those things . SMIT Boswell  --  T-THORP Please . You do n't have to answer now . Just take your time . Think it over . SMIT There are things  --  I could never  --  Boswell  --  T-THORP ( Overlapping from " I could . " ) Please , I can not hear an answer now . Not with the storm . Not tonight . ( The sound of thunder grows louder . ) T-THORP Oh God , there 's thunder . I hate it so much . SMIT ( Overlapping from " thunder . " ) You must listen  --  I have to  --  it 's wrong  --  it is  --  T-THORP ( Overlapping from " have . " ) Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMIT ( Running on . ) I 'm wrong . All wrong ! You think I 'm nice , but I 'm not . I used to kill animals , little animals . I liked to kill them . It made me feel in charge , like I was the boss or a Being , a real high Being . That was a long time ago , but it 's still inside me . And I do n't know what to do . It will always have been done . p. 83 ( She stands before him stricken . He longs to comfort her , but is afraid he does n't know how . ) T-THORP Please . It'sDo n't . You were young . It 's forgotten . Believe me . I swear to you . None of that matters . I want you with me . You are my beloved . Just please now . Please . ( He finally puts his arm around her . The thunder rages . Rain pours down . He holds her tightly . She holds him back . ) T-THORP Oh God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Nothing . Now . I 'm not scared of nothing . ( They hold each other as the rain pours down in corrents and the thunder clashes . As the lights fade , beautiful green rain appears on the TVP screen. ) p. 84 Act 2 , Scene 8 SCENE VIII The Boardwalk . It is sunset . The sky is orange and green . Waves are crashing . Thunder rumbles . Lightning flashes . The Reader is tearing apart her box . Her shirt is torn , exposing her breasts . Her left breast is caked with mud , her right with blood . Her hair and beard are tangled and bedraggled . Boswell appears . He clings to a sheet of paper . T-THORP Reader ! Reader ! Where are you ? Her name . I have her name . My beloved . Reader ! Reader . I  --  what 's happened to you ? READER I can no longer bear the overwhelming stench of other people 's lives . I 'm closing up shop . T-THORP Here , let me offer you some K.

The rancid smell of her stubby hands . T-THORP She works very hard . p. 85 READER Of course . Do n't despair . You 've done what you have done . T-THORP I  --  I 've never been so happy . We 'll start the defrost on her kids , then plan the wedding . She wants an orange dress . If the kids thaw in time , they can be there . I 'll buy them orange suits . Later I 'll have to teach them all to read and write and clap to music . The alphabet is important . I 'll make certain they learn how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure it can all be done . READER No , I would n't worry about the poster . T-THORP The poster . No . I can always mark out some time . READER Your sores are red now . Time is ticking . T-THORP ( He looks at his sores ; they have turned blood red . ) Well , it was really just some pickles . READER Exactly . T-THORP I thought perhaps it could have been good . READER Your best . Your signature . T-THORP My signature . But still it 's not that important . I mean , after all , she , William , she is the one . READER And it would have been such pressure for her being a great man 's wife . People might question her . They might not understand your reasons for choosing an unattractive , uneducated , dimwitted splatterer from the CTZ with frozen children that are not even your own . You know ; people talk . p. 86 T-THORP Still , I 'm thinking even so , she is the one . Look at the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He hands the sheet of paper out to her . ) READER You 're sure ? T-THORP Yes . READER You 're very sure . T-THORP I  --  yes . READER Then why are you asking me ? T-THORP To beto be certainI have to be certain . ( The Reader takes the paper from him and looks at it for a long moment . ) READER M. William Smit . No , she 's not the one . You 've made a mistake . A mistake has been made . ( She hands the sheet of paper back to Boswell . He takes it in his hand and then walks back to his apartment . He hobbles on his cane in a ghostlike trance . The sunset fades . The sky turns dark. ) p. 87 Act 2 , Scene 9 SCENE IX Boswell 's apartment . William is wearing a frilly orange dress and has orange dandies in her hair . Boswell enters . His face is white . He looks at the red sores that have appeared on his skin . SMIT Hello . T-THORP Hello . SMIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice . SMIT I like it so much . Thank you for giving it to me . It makes me  --  it 's so beautiful . ( The TVP begins to bleep . Boswell clicks it up . An Official appears on the screen . C-Boy is with him . ) T-THORP ( To the Official on the screen . ) Yes ? Hello . OFFICIAL ( On the screen . ) I wanted to inform you that we have retrieved your x-ward , M. C-Boy K-Trill , on his food box pickup . He is officially reinstated as a full-time Gov. ward .

SMIT I do n't know . T-THORP You do n't know what ? SMIT Nothing . T-THORP Yes , well , there it is . Do n't you see how impossible this is . You do n't know anything . You have no idea how to think . It simply is not something you do on a regular basis . I mean , can you tell me  --  have you ever wondered  --  What is your purpose ? SMIT Uh-uh . T-THORP That does n't surprise me . And yet it seems apparent that , if you are going to be alive , you should know your purpose . But you do n't know . You do n't even think . See how we are incapable of having any sort of intelligent , meaningful exchange ! p. 89 SMIT I thought  --  it seemed  --  you do love me . T-THORP Did I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not recall saying that . SMIT You do n't have to say . T-THORP Well , if I do n't say , if I did n't say , what made you think  --  excuse me , I forgot , you do n't think . So I suppose I have to sit here and explain everything to you . Well , get this flat . Love is a mendacious myth . Everyone is just an egg . A slimy yolk in their own shell . Smash two eggs together , what happens ? They break . The result is two chickens are killed , a runny omelet is served , " Good morning , everyone . " H.A.N . fucking D. SMIT You want to call off the marriage ? T-THORP I think , perhaps . SMIT Alright . T-THORP I 'm going to devote myself entirely to the pickle . SMIT I  --  I. T-THORP What ? SMIT I 'll fix you a medical concoction . T-THORP It 's not time . SMIT But , I see  --  your sores , they 're  --  T-THORP What ? p. 90 SMIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leave ? T-THORP Yes . I do n't want you around me while I 'm dying . I know how you like to kill and torture dying prey . It 's part of your makeup . It 's who you are . It makes you feel good . Like you 're a Being , a real high Being . SMIT Oh no , please . Do n't . I ca n't . I 'll go . I 'll pack . ( She starts to pack . ) I 'll go . I  --  where ? If only  --  I just  --  I  --  I wan na go home . I do . But it 's  --  all gone . My home . My family , the silk elm , the red saucer I ate from . And my brother , Andy . How fast he could run across the dirt . How he recited to me such things he would write if ever he could learn to read . I want so much to go see my home . I do . I do . I wish I could dream it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go home again . You 'd know that if you had an education . But you do n't , so you have to learn everything through personal experience . It must be so exhausting . Do you have all of your things ? SMIT Yes . T-THORP Then you should go . ( William picks up all of her belongings and exits . ) T-THORP Good then . She 's gone . Now I can work , Back to the pickle . My signature . p. 91 ( Boswell goes back to his writing . As the lights fade , " Celeb Bites " theme music comes up . A huge poster shaped like a pickle comes up on the TVP screen . The poster is covered with a tarp . Various highbrows are eyeing it with anticipation. ) p. 92 Act 2 , Scene 10 SCENE X A grassy knoll . Day . L-Tip is interviewing Boswell . A harsh , pink light encircles them . L-Tip wears a skintight dress and a peculiar headdress that bobbles . Boswell has lost most of his hair . He stands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes are still burning . The Celeb Bites ' music starts to fade . T-THORP Hello , this is L-Tip the Hip Lip and I 'm standing here with art philosopher , M. Boswell T-Thorp . Any moment now the A.P . Bureau Chiefs will be unveiling M. T-Thorp 's new poster , " Death and a Jar of Pickles . " Are you nervous , M. T-Thorp ? T-THORP Not in the least . In fact , I 've never been so relaxed in my entire life . T-THORP May I ask , why you have chosen to retreat to this grassy knoll rather than to be present at the Show All Pavilion to see how your poster is publicly received ? T-THORP Well , L-Tip , I 'll tell you , I love the public . They 're all wonderful folks , I 'm sure . But I really have no interest in their opinions . I 'm secure and fulfilled in whom I am . My poster stands on its own . T-THORP Well , M. T-Thorp , you certainly are a man of Himalayan values . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93 T-THORP Thank you for talking to us . It 's been a true bang-a-roo . And please , H.A.N.D . T-THORP H.A.N.D. ? ( The pink circle of light abruptly disappears . ) T-THORP ( Talking to the crew . ) Okay , fine , Click . Were you able to get in all of my headgear ? Sin . Now let 's pack up and dust to the Show All . T-THORP ( Coming up to her . ) I thought you were going to ask me for my interpretation of the poster . Why , that interview was vulgarly anorexic and evisceratingly inane ! T-THORP Please , Boswell , do n't start giving me shit . I 've just spent the entire morning trying to suck in my stomach . T-THORP You think just because you have your own satellite show  --  why , I 'm getting ready to take this world by storm . When people see these pickles , nothing will ever be the same . There may well be a referendum to reinstate the office of king . T-THORP Well , are n't you just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any road maps . T-THORP You 're just jeally . T-THORP I 'm jeally ! God ! ( Max enters ; he is horribly distressed . ) T-THORP There you are  --  I  --  have you heard ? p. 94 T-THORP What ? T-THORP Your poster ? The unveiling ? T-THORP No . T-THORP Do n't go down there . It 's  --  they did n't  --  T-THORP What ? It 's not good . I can see this is n't good . ( L-Tip clicks in her portable TVP . ) T-THORP ( Into the TVP remote . ) Stringer  --  K , are you down there ? What 's going on ? Pan over . ( She watches the action on the tiny TVP screen . ) Oh my God . They 're throwing things at your poster . T-THORP Things ? What things ? T-THORP Fruit cores , chairs , mudballs . Look at this , an evil pork is setting it on fire . T-THORP Oh , my God . My poor pickles . Stop them . Wo n't somebody stop them ? Wo n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Looks like the Stick Guards are in on it , too . Why , they 're beating on it with spiked mallets . T-THORP My precious poster . My dearest pickles . Why ? Oh , why ? T-THORP I do n't know , I heard they thought it was making fun of our Food Suppliers . p. 95 T-THORP Our Food Suppliers ? ? ! ! But I was n't  --  I did n't  --  this was not a joke . This was not in fun . I wanted the people , I wanted them to understand my pickles . Their thoughts , their feelings , their predicament . What it was like for them inside that jar . Oh , why ca n't they see what I see ? If only I had a laser zap . Quick ! Someone bring me a laser zap . Bring me a zap . T-THORP Stabilize . Stabilize . Remember what you said about your work standing on its own ? How you are secure and fulfilled in who you are ? T-THORP Lies . All lies . Nothing but lies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down there . Remember , you 're stronger than you think . T-THORP That would be inevitable . T-THORP ( To L-Tip . ) Nice suit . T-THORP Drop dead . ( L-Tip hurries off . ) T-THORP Hey , look . I 'm sorry , Boz . I 'm really sorry . But I suppose if you were , well , grasping at straws , you might see it as something of a compliment that the people would take the time to so brutally and viciously destroy your work . T-THORP Yes , well , why do n't we just leave that chaff in the crib. p. 96 T-THORP Sure , of course . ( A beat . ) Wellis n't it strange . T-THORP What ? T-THORP We 're bothstanding here . ( Boswell looks at Max standing on the grassy knoll . He then becomes horribly aware of his own body standing on the surface of the world . Slowly , Boswell starts to breathe very heavily . Max tries to grin , but he seems to lack sincerity . As the lights fade , cheerful piped-in euth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 SCENE XI Euthanasia Gardens . Flowery euth music plays . L-Tip sits on a stone bench . She wears a red coat decorated with hearts , and a red hat with a veil . She carries a TVP remote . William enters dressed in her orange dress that has been dyed red . She wears her W.Y. badge . She also carries a TVP remote . SMIT Hi . T-THORP William . SMIT Hi . T-THORP It 's been SMIT Yes . Long . T-THORP Where 's C-Boy ? I heard he 's become your ward . SMIT Yes , he has . He 'll be here today . After I come , he 's coming . We 're trading off staying with my kids . They 're in final thaw . T-THORP Oh , brill . That 's just brill . SMIT Yes . It 's been a very fortunate time for me . I got elected Worker of the Year . Plus we won a bonus vacation to anyplace in the zone that has n't been splattered . T-THORP Oh . Where will you go ? SMIT Anaheim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceiling they brought over . T-THORP What ceiling ? p. 98 SMIT The one with all sorts of old-fashioned , heavyset people painted on it . I think it 's got God in it somewhere and he 's going like this  --  ( William reaches her arm out and extends her index finger . ) T-THORP Oh , yes . That 's very popular . SMIT Uh-huh . ( A beat . ) Is he  --  I mean  --  Have you seen Boswell ? T-THORP No . He 's not here yet . SMIT Do you know how he is ? T-THORP Not good . His sores are black now . SMIT Oh . I just  --  I hope I can leave before he comes . I do n't ever wan na see him again . Why are we waiting ? T-THORP The body 's being capsulized . It should n't be much longer . SMIT Umm . Would you like to see my kids ? T-THORP Oh yes . SMIT I 'll click them up . ( William takes her remote TVP and clicks through her number . ) SMIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Look who 's here . ( L-Tip waves into William 's TVP screen . ) T-THORP Hi , C-Boy . Jacka , jacka. p. 99 SMIT ( Into the TVP . ) C-Boy , show her the kids . Look , there they are . T-THORP Oh . Oh . Are n't they shug . SMIT ( Pointing at the screen . ) That one 's Bonnie . And that 's Tabell . Look how they can move their hands and toes . In just about a week their lids will start to open . T-THORP Sin . Simply , sin . SMIT ( Into the TVP . ) Thanks , C-Boy . I 'll be back as soon as I can . H.A.N.D . ( She clicks off . ) T-THORP I  --  did you know I have a child now ? SMIT No . T-THORP Yes , I 've been desperate for one for a long time . Here , I 'll click her up . ( She clicks through her number . ) Her name 's Grace . ( Into her TVP . ) Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Looking at L-Tip 's TVP screen . ) Oh , she 's very pretty . T-THORP Is n't she the cutest and most cuddly . She 's the newest thing . They call them Toss ' Em Toddlers . Her natural life span is only three years . Is n't it wonderful . She 'll be adorable her whole life . And I wo n't ever have to worry about those awkward years . Not to mention the high cost of education . p. 100 ( L-Tip waves good-bye to Grace and clicks her off . ) SMIT Wo n't it be sad though ? T-THORP Oh no . It 's all completely natural . See , I do n't have time for a full-term child . I mean , I 'm competing in a world where fantasy puppets set the step . They never take time out for children or family , ultra surgery or even rehab . They 're completely consumed with constructing careers . The pressure gets to be devastating . Of course , I 'm terrifically unhappy . Before I started going to my therochief I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm totally aware of my misery . It 's a big improvement . ( Reader appears in a white dress , decorated with pink carnations . She has shaved her beard and her hair is neatly bubbled and coiffed . Her demeanor has completely changed . She is vapid , calm , and glazed . ) READER Good morning M. 's . You may come in now , if you like , the capsulation has been completed . T-THORP Thanks . ( L-Tip and William head toward the entrance . ) T-THORP God , do n't we look silly . I hate these theme funerals . ( They all three exit . Boswell enters . He walks with two canes . His black sores have spread . He slowly hobbles to the bench and sits down . William reenters . She is wiping away tears . Boswell sees her . ) T-THORP Hello . p. 101 SMIT Hi . T-THORP Did you go in ? SMIT Yes . Yes . Max . Poor Max . He 's so small . They 've made him so small . T-THORP They 've capsulized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 've got him smiling . It 's this small , little , tiny , little smile . T-THORP Well , they do that , I suppose . SMIT Uh huh . T-THORP William . SMIT What ? T-THORP I thought I might never see you again . SMIT Yes , I thought so , too . T-THORP Would you shake my hand ? SMIT Why ? T-THORP I do n't know . No rock feelings ? SMIT But I do ; I have them . I have rock feelings . T-THORP Well , then , I do n't know . What is there to do ? It 's all too late . What is there to do ? SMIT I have to go . T-THORP Yes , well , H.A.N.D . ( William exits . Reader enters . She approaches Boswell . ) READER Hello . Would you like me to show you to the viewing room ? The capsule is on display . p. 102 T-THORP No . Not just yet . READER Take your time . ( Reader strolls around the garden . He watches her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? READER Me ? I do n't think so . T-THORP There 's something about you . You remind meDid you ever have a beard ? READER Yes , I think , perhaps . You see , I was very ill at one point . I 've had brain fiber treatments . I 'm much better now . T-THORP What was  --  the problem ? READER I was malignantly insane . I thought I could read people 's lives through their handwriting . I 'd take people 's K. and spin deluded tales . I made one pathetic man write the word pickle ten thousand times . But I 'm much better now . T-THORP Then you  --  it was all  --  you never knewanything ? READER What could I know ? I was crippled with a fevered cranium . T-THORP Oh my God . Oh my God . A mistake has been made . ( L-Tip enters . She is crying blue tears . ) T-THORP Max . Dear Max . God . How can I live without him ? How can I ever live without him ? Boswell  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises to his feet and hobbles in the same direction William departed . ) T-THORP YesBut I didI realize now , I did love him . I loved him all along . ( Boswell stops . He is gasping for air . He points one of his canes in William 's direction trembling with determination . ) T-THORP It 's too late though ! T-THORP Yes , all along . I loved him all along . ( Boswell lowers his cane . ) READER I have to believe . I am ; I 'm much better now . T-THORP William ! My beloved ! William ! ( Boswell moves forward and goes to find William . The lights fade to blackout )
