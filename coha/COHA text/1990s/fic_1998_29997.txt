Slowly , silently , its lights a faint glitter of life amid the darkness , the Imperial Star Destroyer Chimaera glided through space . Empty space . Oppressively dark space . Long , lonely light-years from the nearest of the tiny islands that were the star systems of the galaxy , drifting at the edge of the boundary between the Outer Rim worlds and the vast regions of territory known as Unknown Space . At the very edge of the Empire . Or rather , at the edge of the pitiful scraps of what had once been the Empire . Standing beside one of the Chimaera 's side viewports , Admiral Pellaeon , Supreme Commander of the Imperial Fleet , gazed out at the emptiness , the weight of all too many years pressing heavily across his shoulders . Too many years , too many battles , too many defeats . Perhaps the Chimaera 's bridge crew was feeling the weight , too . Certainly the sounds of activity going on behind him seemed more muted than usual today . But perhaps it was merely the effect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No , of course that had to be it . The men of the Chimaera were the finest the Fleet had to offer . They were Imperial officers and crewers , and Imperials did n't give up . Ever . There was a tentative footstep at his side . " Admiral ? " Captain Ardiff said quietly . " We 're ready to begin , sir . " For a moment Pellaeon 's mind flashed back ten years , to another very similar moment . Then , it had been Pellaeon and Grand Admiral Thrawn who 'd been here on the Chimaera 's bridge , watching the final test of the prototype cloaking shield Thrawn had recovered from among the Emperor 's trophies inside Mount Tantiss . Pellaeon could remember the excitement he 'd felt then , despite his misgivings about the insane Jedi clone Joruus C'baoth , as he watched Thrawn single-handedly breathing new life and vigor back into the Empire . But Mount Tantiss was gone , destroyed by agents of the New Republic and C'baoth 's own madness and treason . And Grand Admiral Thrawn was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pellaeon shook the shadows of the past away . He was an Imperial officer , and Imperials did n't give up . " Thank you , " he said to Ardiff . " At your convenience , Captain . " " Yes , sir . " Ardiff half turned , gestured to the fighter coordinator in the portside crew pit . " Signal the attack , " he ordered . The officer acknowledged and gestured in turn to one of his crewers . Pellaeon turned his attention back to the viewport  - -  Just in time to see eight SoroSuub Preybird-class starfighters in tight formation roar in from behind them . Cutting tight to the Chimaera 's command superstructure , they passed over the forward ridgeline , raking it with low-power blaster fire , then split smoothly out in eight different directions . Corkscrewing out and forward , they kept up their fire until they were out of the Star Destroyer 's primary attack zone . Then , curving smoothly around , they swung around and regrouped . " Admiral ? " Ardiff prompted . " Let 's give them one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more flight data the Predictor has to work with , the better it should function . " He caught the eye of one of the crew pit officers . " Damage report ? " " Minor damage to the forward ridgeline , sir , " the officer reported . " One sensor array knocked out , leaving five turbolasers without ranging data . " " Acknowledged . " All theoretical damage , of course , calculated under the assumption that the Preybirds were using full-power capital-ship turbolasers . Pellaeon had always loved war games when he was younger ; had relished the chance to play with technique and tactics without the risks of true combat . Somewhere in all those years , the excitement had faded away . " Helm , bring us around twenty degrees to starboard , " he ordered . " Starboard turbolasers will lay down dispersion fire as they make their next pass . " The Preybirds were back in tight formation now , once again approaching their target . The Chimaera 's turbolasers opened up as they came , their low-level fire splattering across the Preybirds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opponents traded fire ; then , the Preybirds broke formation again , splitting apart like the fingertips of an opening hand . Twisting over and under the Chimaera , they shot past , scrambling for the safety of distance . " Damage report ? " Pellaeon called . " Three starboard turbolaser batteries knocked out , " the officer called back . " We 've also lost one tractor beam projector and two ion cannon . " " Enemy damage ? " " One attacker appears to have lost its deflector shields , and two others are reading diminished turbolaser capability . " " Hardly counts as damage , " Ardiff murmured . " Of course , the situation here is n't exactly fair . Ships that small and maneuverable would never have the kind of shields or firepower we 're crediting them with . " " If you want fairness , organize a shockball tournament , " Pellaeon said acidly . " Do n't look for it in warfare . " Ardiff 's cheek twitched . " I 'm sorry , sir . " Pellaeon sighed . The finest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloaking shield , Captain , " he ordered , watching the faint drive glows as the Preybirds regrouped again in the distance . " Activate on my command . " " Yes , Admiral . " There was a sudden flare of drive glow , partially eclipsed by the Preybirds themselves , as the enemy kicked into high acceleration . " Here they come , " Pellaeon said , watching as the single glowing dot rapidly resolved itself into eight close-formation ships . " Lock Predictor into fire control . Stand by cloaking shield . " " Predictor and cloaking shield standing by , " Ardiff confirmed . Pellaeon nodded , his full attention on the Preybirds . Nearly to the point where they 'd broken formation last time ... " Cloaking shield : now . " And with a brief flicker of bridge lighting , the stars and incoming Preybirds vanished as the cloaking shield plunged the Chimaera into total darkness . " Cloaking shield activated and stabilized , " Ardiff said . " Helm , come around portside : thirty degrees by eight , " Pellaeon ordered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Acknowledged , " an officer called . " Turbolasers are firing . " Pellaeon took a step closer to the viewport and looked down along the Chimaera 's sides . The faint blasts of low-level fire were visible , lancing a short distance out from the Star Destroyer and then disappearing as they penetrated the spherical edge of the Star Destroyer 's cloaking shield . Blinded by the very device that was now shielding it from its opponents ' view , the Chimaera was firing wildly in an attempt to destroy those opponents . Or perhaps not quite so wildly . If the Predictor worked as well as its designers hoped , perhaps the Empire still had a chance in this war . It was a long time before the Chimaera 's turbolasers finally ceased fire . Far too long . " Is that it ? " he asked Ardiff . " Yes , sir , " the other said . " Five hundred shots , as preprogrammed . " Pellaeon nodded . " Deactivate cloaking shield . Let 's see how well we did . " There was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mentally crossing his fingers , Pellaeon peered out the viewport . For a moment there was nothing . Then , from starboard , he spotted the approaching drive glows . Seven of them . " Signal from Adversary Commander , Admiral , " the comm officer called . " Target Three reports receiving a disabling hit and has gone dormant ; all other targets have sustained only minimal damage . Requesting orders . " Pellaeon grimaced . One . Out of eight targets , the Chimaera had been able to hit exactly one . And that great feat had required five hundred shots to achieve . So that was that . The wonderful Computerized Combat Predictor , touted by its creators and sponsors as the best approach to practical use of the cloaking shield , had been put to the test . And to be fair , it had probably done better than simple random shooting . But it had n't done enough better . Not nearly enough . " Inform Adversary Commander that the exercise is over , " Pellaeon told the comm officer . " Target Three may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chimaera . I want their reports filed within the next two hours . " " Yes , sir . " " I 'm sure they 'll be able to improve it , Admiral , " Ardiff said at Pellaeon 's side . " This was just the first field test . Surely they 'll be able to improve it . " " How ? " Pellaeon retorted . " Train the Predictor to be omniscient ? Or simply teach it how to read our enemies ' minds ? " " You only gave it two passes to study the targets ' flight patterns , " Ardiff reminded him . " With more data , it could have better anticipated their movements . " Pellaeon snorted gently . " It 's a nice theory , Captain , and under certain controlled situations it might even work . But combat is hardly a controlled situation . There are far too many variables and unknowns , especially considering the hundreds of alien species and combat styles we have to contend with . I knew from the beginning that this Predictor idea was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , then , we just have to go back to mark zero , " Ardiff said . " Come up with something else . There have to be practical uses for this cloaking shield device . " " Of course there are , " Pellaeon agreed heavily . " Grand Admiral Thrawn devised three of them himself . But there 's no one left in the Empire with his military genius . " He sighed . " No , Captain . It 's over . It 's all over . And we 've lost . " For a long moment the low murmur of background conversation was the only sound on the bridge . " You ca n't mean that , Admiral , " Ardiff said at last . " And if I may say so , sir , this is not the sort of thing the Supreme Commander of Imperial forces should be talking about . " " Why not ? " Pellaeon countered . " It 's obvious to everyone else . " " It most certainly is not , sir , " Ardiff said stiffly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabited systems . We have the Fleet , nearly two hundred Star Destroyers strong . We 're still very much a force to be reckoned with . "
