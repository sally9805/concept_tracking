<p> An appearance on national television for the University of Houston basketball team during the Clyde Drexler coaching experiment could mean more than increased revenue and exposure for the school . <p> It also could mean a boost for Drexler 's bank account . <p> An arrangement in which Drexler will pocket $ 10,000 for certain national TV appearances by the Cougars is one of several unusual facets of the deal that brought the former NBA star back to his alma mater as head basketball coach . <p> Drexler , who earned $ 11 million in his last two years with the Rockets , will receive $ 250,000 a year in guaranteed income at UH - a base salary of $ 150,000 and guaranteed revenue totaling $ 100,000 from a summer camp and radio and TV shows . <p> Considering those numbers , Drexler will be underpaid in comparison to others in college coaching . But the terms of his contract , provided to the Chronicle by UH , include several ways in which he can obtain thousands of dollars in additional income if he is able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local and national interest in the Cougars program . <p> UH athletic director Chet Gladchuk said the contract terms are unique because they are an attempt to provide fair compensation within the context of the athletic department 's tough financial circumstances . <p> " The concept behind this contract is two things , " said Gladchuk , who came to UH last year after previously serving as athletic director at Tulane and Boston College . " No. 1 , we wanted to put a reasonable base salary in place . I 've negotiated a dozen coaches ' contracts , and everybody makes $ 150,000 , or at least they should . That 's the basic institutional commitment . <p> " The way to close the gap after that was to try and find innovative ways to generate the external funding that would allow us to pay Clyde a reasonable salary , if in fact the staff earned it . As you know , with our fiscal issues here , it 's not as though we can go out and put $ 500,000 down and bet on the come . What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit based on the growth and success of the program . " <p> Drexler 's contract contains many of the incentives typically found in such deals , including payments for winning the Conference USA regular-season and tournament titles ( $ 10,000 each ) , finishing in the top 25 in the USA Today poll ( $ 10,000 ) and making the NCAA Tournament ( $ 25,000 ) . <p> It also contains several atypical elements , one being a clause dealing with appearances by the Cougars on CBS . Drexler will receive $ 10,000 for each appearance , starting with the second such appearance in a given season . <p> Gladchuk said one game on CBS in a season would be possible for UH even if the Cougars are mediocre because the network might look to feature Louisville , Cincinnati or another Conference USA program with a recent history of success . But a second game , he said , would indicate UH had earned its " stripes " and that Drexler would deserve a cut of the school 's revenue ( about $ 25,000 per appearance ) . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It could be a split regional ( broadcast ) , but it has to be a network game . Once he ( Drexler ) realizes a network game , we generate new income , and he gets a piece of it . " <p> UH has not appeared on a network TV broadcast other than those of ESPN or ESPN2 since the Cougars played Louisville in a game shown regionally by ABC in February 1993 , a year before the breakup of the Southwest Conference . CBS televised six regular-season games involving Conference USA teams last season ; ABC did three . <p> Another source of supplemental income for Drexler will emerge if UH averages more than 6,000 per game in paid attendance at Hofheinz Pavilion . He will get 20 percent of a figure computed by multiplying the average number of tickets above 6,000 by the average price per ticket . <p> During Alvin Brooks ' five years as UH coach , the best the university could do as far as home attendance was an average of 4,698 in 1995-96 . The worst occurred last season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Said Gladchuk : " I took the 6,000 tickets and calculated out what that generated in terms of revenue . I factored in other revenue-generating entities and said , ' Jeez , if I can get 6,000 on the ticket side coupled with advertising and radio and TV ( revenue ) , etc. , that 's what I need ( to cover operating costs ) . ' Anything beyond that is gravy for us . Therefore , his ( Drexler 's ) incentive is to be part of a program that delivers more than 6,000 per game . " <p> Although recent history says 6,000 is a pipe dream , Drexler 's last season as a player at UH , 1982-83 , saw the Cougars draw an average of 7,990 at Hofheinz . And people do seem willing to buy into Phi Slama Jama Jr . Spurred by Drexler 's hiring as coach March 18 , UH has 4,154 commitments for season tickets for next season , far surpassing the 1,200 that were sold for 1997-98 . <p> " Clyde will own a piece of the rock , so to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Drexler will be paid $ 20,000 if his program has a graduation rate of at least 60 percent over a two-year period and $ 10,000 if the Cougars win the Conference USA tournament while posting a grade-point average of 2.5 . <p> As for Drexler 's academic situation , reportedly 43 hours short of an undergraduate degree , the contract states that , starting with the 1999-2000 academic year , he will make " reasonable part-time efforts " to obtain his degree from UH . <p> Asked how the university will define such effort , Gladchuk said : " There are no specifics other than he would be pursuing his degree . What 's reasonable ? Maybe summer courses . Maybe courses in the fall and not the spring . We 'll have to sit down and determine the way to go . <p> " It 's basically just a reminder that it ( the idea of Drexler completing his degree ) was a very serious discussion we had , that he 's going to graduate from the University of Houston and we 're going to support him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both made . " <p> Gladchuk acknowledged that Drexler 's lack of a degree could be an issue for some educators . But he said the matter should be considered in light of the fact Drexler left school early for NBA riches , a path many in his shoes would have chosen . <p> " We knew that , as an educational institution hiring someone in a leadership role , the question of finishing his degree would surface , " Gladchuk said . " But the more you think about it , Clyde is reflective of the profile of a lot of students at the University of Houston . Many come and go . The banner that 's being waved here is , ' No matter what you do , no matter how long you 're gone , come back and get your degree . ' Clyde had a very legitimate business reason to leave . The clause in his contract represents his personal commitment to education . " <p> Another unique aspect of Drexler 's contract is a buyout clause that could require him to pay UH as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball-related job . <p> According to the contract , if Drexler takes another basketball job within a year of leaving UH , he will be required to repay a sum equal to all funds he earned at the university in base salary up to $ 500,000 . The only way around the stipulation is if , at the time Drexler moves to another job , $ 1.5 million has been collected to endow UH 's head coaching position . <p> Gladchuk said he and Drexler plan to raise the funds for the endowment , which will be named after former Cougars coach Guy V. Lewis . <p> " One of Clyde 's commitments is that whenever his tenure ends - and hopefully it 's 20 years down the road - he would leave behind a fully endowed head basketball coach 's position , " Gladchuk said . " If we do n't get it ( the endowment ) done and , say , Rudy ( Tomjanovich ) leaves the Rockets and they ca n't live without Clyde , then he ( Drexler ) would factor into our next negotiation ( with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as $ 500,000 to put toward the endowment . " <p> <p> Drexler 's contract <p> Length : Five years ( June 1 , 1998 , to May 31 , 2003 ) . Contract is subject to renegotiation after three years or when UH earns a berth in the NCAA Tournament . <p> Base salary : $ 150,000 annually . <p> Income from coach 's radio and TV shows : First $ 50,000 to coach ( guaranteed ) , second $ 50,000 to university , next $ 25,000 to coach , next $ 25,000 to university .
