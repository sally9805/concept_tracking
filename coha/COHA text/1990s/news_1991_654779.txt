<p> BARBARA ROBERTS 'S path to the governorship of Oregon is a textbook case in grass-roots politics - in taking chances and making chances , in speaking plainly on controversial issues , in working hard on the things you know about , and in steadily developing expertise on those you do n't . She did it at a time when there were few role models for women . And now she is giving advice to younger women also coming up the ladder . <p> Governor Roberts is a relatively liberal Democrat who started her political life as a campaign worker for John F. Kennedy . " He excited me , he inspired me , he made me feel good about my country , he made me feel good about being an American , " she recalled in a recent interview . But as a young housewife and mother , it was something closer to home that really got her involved in politics . <p> One of her sons was autistic , but the state had no programs for children with special needs . So she became a one-woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislators , and eventually prevailing . " I had to fight the education association , the state school boards association , the school administrators ' association , " she says . " I basically took on all of the special interests of education and won . " <p> Following a series of elected and appointed positions on boards , commissions , and councils in Oregon , she ran for the state legislature and won there too , serving two terms as House Speaker . For much of this time she was a single mother , working as a bookkeeper and office manager . Then she ran statewide for the post of secretary of state , and won that as well . <p> When Gov . Neil Goldschmidt surprised the political establishment last year by announcing he would not run for reelection due to marital difficulties , Roberts jumped in . Her Republican opponent , state Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer , was strongly favored early in the campaign , but by election time Roberts had passed him by . <p> Over the past 15 years or so , while the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level , the number serving in state and local offices has grown steadily . Roberts sees three reasons for this . First , most women in politics started out working for abortion rights or the Equal Rights Amendment , and then moved on to boards and councils along the grass-roots path , as she did . " They came to make a difference , and they began to find that in the process they were capable of being the decisionmaker . " <p> Second , the cost of running for the United States Congress or Senate has become especially prohibitive for those without connections , which includes most fledgling politicians who are women . " Women do n't say , ' I think I want to be a US senator and I 've got $5 million and my daddy can provide the rest and I have lots of political friends , ' " she says , without any tone of cynicism . " They tend to come up through the ranks . " <p> The third reason women have yet to move fully into national politics , she says , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female is acceptable because women ' do kids , ' women can do the city council because that 's sort of OK , and the legislature is beginning to be acceptable in most states because we deal with a lot of issues that are OK for women to deal with . <p> " But the higher you come up that political scale in people 's minds , " she goes on , " the more it 's a question of leadership , strength , and courage - attributes that we usually give to men . " <p> As Roberts surveys the political scene today , she says she believes women bring qualities and attitudes that are increasingly attractive to voters of both sexes . The women she knows in politics are more direct than men , yet at the same time more willing to work cooperatively toward solving public problems . " Women represent a very different kind of leadership , " she says . <p> Roberts 's advice to other women seeking elective office is threefold : " Demonstrate your courage very clearly ... , learn how to cite your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If someone said to me , ' Barbara Roberts , why are you supporting the sales tax ? ' I 'd say , ' As a person who worked in business for 15 years and spent four years on the revenue and school-finance committee , I 'll tell you why I think this . ' ... I cited my credentials before I gave my opinion . " <p> In last year 's gubernatorial race , Roberts stuck her neck out on several issues . She favored a ballot measure to close the Trojan nuclear power plant , citing concerns about on-site radioactive waste storage near the Columbia River . Although the measure was rejected ( industry groups outspent backers 6 to 1 ) , voters respected her position , based as it was on her experience on the Oregon-Washington board that deals with the Hanford nuclear reactor upstream on the Columbia River . <p> The more visceral issue in Oregon is the future of the timber industry in light of the listing of the northern spotted owl as a threatened species . While Republican Frohnmayer was more inclined to fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adjust in light of dwindling wood supplies , increasing exports , and plant modernization that sees machines replacing loggers and mill workers . <p> " People thought I was dead . They thought I could not win the election talking about that , " she says . " But I went right into the mills and talked with the workers . I went right into timber rallies and talked with people . And I told environmental groups never to be smug when people are losing their jobs and their homes and their livelihood . " <p> Now that she is the governor , Roberts has big challenges ahead : to straighten out Oregon 's tax structure ( it has no sales tax and voters approved property tax limits ) ; to reorganize the state 's education and training structure ; and to prepare for the transportation , housing , and land-use needs that are as inevitable as the thousands of newcomers who move here every month . <p> Asked what her next job might be , Barbara Roberts demurs . " I said in my inaugural address that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's OK if that 's how it works out . If I know that I 've done the best I can do , the most I can do for my state and its people during these four years , I 'll be very happy . "
