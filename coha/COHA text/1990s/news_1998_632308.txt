<p> Ninety minutes out of Tokyo on the new Shinkansen train , I arrived at the tourist intersection of the 1998 Winter Olympics and 14 centuries of Japanese Buddhism . <p> While gleaming and sleek Olympic structures have cropped up on the former farm fields in Nagano , one place in town has changed little and that is Zenko-ji Temple . This place first opened in the 6th century . <p> A Jodo sect priest dressed in flowing black robes with shiny golden embroidery met me at the temple entrance . The scent of incense was everywhere . <p> Lucky for me , the priest spoke perfect English ; I knew nothing about the Japanese language except for konnichiwa ( good afternoon ) and arigato ( thank you ) . <p> The priest , Kiwa Fukushima , flashed huge smiles and spoke with patience , a change from five years ago when he stood at a lectern and taught chemical engineering at Yokohama University outside Tokyo . <p> About his personal conversion , he said : ##v , &lt; ! ! " ! ! ##$ . # &%; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be part of the big change here . " <p> Fukushima does a great job making foreigners feel comfortable in one of the most famous temples in Japan . <p> Zenko-ji still commands the maximum amount of attention in this town of 347,000 people . Five million visitors arrive at the temple each year , particularly because Zenko-ji is open to women and Buddhists from all sects . <p> The building itself is in its 11th incarnation  --  10 times down through the ages the structure has burned and each time has been rebuilt pretty much in its earlier likeness . The present temple was built in 1707 . It is regal and stately and set up on a hill among a grouping of sub-temples . <p> Followers from all around Japan and the world come to this place in hopes of being blessed by the high priest before the morning chant or finding the key to paradise after a dark cavernous search . <p> Visitors walk through a deep , dark , winding tunnel built under Zenko-ji . After a few hundred yards , turning two times to the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock at hip level . <p> The priests tell you where to look . The rod marks the spot where the holy image is enshrined above . I was told it is a sacred place , but equally sacred for me was the scene that takes place every dawn at Zenko-ji . I challenged myself to wake early the next morning to witness it . <p> I rose at 6 a.m. to a crisp fall morning . By 6:20 the sun had risen and I could see a little bustle of activity  --  the priests gathering in front of me . The head priest was being shielded by an aide carrying a red umbrella . <p> I dropped my pen and paper and ran with my camera banging against my chest . I just wanted to get close enough for the right shot . I scurried up the stairs and through the gates guarded by what appeared to be two big , fierce , man-faced lions . In front of me elderly Japanese began to kneel in a line awaiting the touch of the ojuzu ( prayer beads ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you are blessed in this fashion , you will receive the Buddha 's favor forever . <p> The morning chant I heard inside the temple was extraordinary . Eleven priests merged their voices together and sent their harmonic tones emanating through this ageless hall built of massive beams and timbers . Huge barrel drums and the clang of an ancient gong accompanied them . <p> One American woman standing near me was ecstatic , having been blessed twice in one day . She arrived just as the priests entered the building about 6:30 a.m. , and she was alert as the morning chants stopped about 7:20 and a line of Buddhist priests exited through the side door , walked the length of the long wooden-beamed building and emerged at the bottom of the front steps . <p> She was there waiting again . " I 'm always up for new religious experiences , " Qshe said with a smile . <p> Heading out to see Nagano 's neighbors offers visitors a different kind of experience . <p> To satisfy my appetite for history , I made a visit to Matsumoto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Tsumago , a restored old post town along the Nakasendo Highway that linked Kyoto and Edo-era Tokyo . <p> Matsumoto features a lovely castle that gave me a taste of what life was like in a fortified castle with secret passageways and hidden floors , no heat and seven steep staircases . The three-turreted donjon is the oldest in the country . The castle was built in 1594 by the feudal lord of the time who took refuge in it whenever the area was under attack . As it turned out , that was quite often . <p> The people of Matsumoto had established a salt trail through the mountains to the Japan Sea and that drew attacks from other feudal lords who wanted part of the salt stash . The Shiyohnomichi Trail ( Salt Trail ) over the Japanese Alps is a five-hour journey by car , but each year many Japanese undertake a symbolic pilgrimage . Along the way , people offer the walkers sake , the liquor made of fermented rice . <p> One museum in Matsumoto is a real stand-out . The Ukiyo-e Museum provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Wood block prints show life around the ritual baths , which before the arrival of the Dutch and Portuguese missionaries were communal ; rural scenes of the annual rice harvest , and Kitagawa Utamaro 's world-famous closeup scenes of beautiful women brushing their hair over their shoulders . <p> The colorful imagery and style are said to have influenced artists such as Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec . The entire collection consists of 100,000 prints , paintings , screens and old books  --  the largest private collection of its kind in the world . <p> Just 20 minutes out of Matsumoto my train lifted into the mountains surrounding the Kiso Valley and whirled by tall evergreens and a sprinkling of maples about to turn red . In less than a half hour , I arrive on the outskirts of Tsumago , one of 11 post towns along the Nakasendo Highway that linked Edo-era Tokyo and old Kyoto . <p> Tsumago is a town of 300-year-old buildings . <p> This stretch of road made up a large segment of the even more famous Tokaido Highway , of which novels have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used by retainers of the shogun who were sent to guard Osaka Castle . Post towns popped up usually a day 's walking distance apart . <p> It was here , my guide told me , that the Japanese preservation movement was born in 1968 . Tsumago was the first ancient city to be fully protected by law . No modern developments such as telephone lines or TV aerials are allowed to mar the scene . <p> A house in the center of town once served as a post town inn . Today it is the Okuya Kyodokan Folk Museum . The displays tell the history of the time period . The Okuya house , owned by the Hayashi family , was rebuilt in 1877 from the prized hinoki or cypress wood , which had been banned for use by the public during the Edo period . <p> Japanese home interiors are often made of exposed woods , and throughout the ages cypress has been prized for its tight grain and insect resistance . But for stealing trees from the forest , violators could be put to death . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one neck . The ban on using cypress was lifted in 1868 , when a great liberalization swept through Japan . The wooden buildings in this town are exquisite to behold . <p> I contemplated a three-hour walk between Tsumago and the post town nearest it called Magome , which also is filled with rows of traditional houses and post inns and an array of souvenir shops . <p> As a special service for walkers on the trail between Magome and Tsumago , the tourist offices in both villages offer an inexpensive baggage-forwarding service during peak visiting seasons . <p> Although the walk sounded invigorating , I opted to return to the Onsen Fukinomori , a traditional hot-springs resort . It was about time for another round of muscle-melting baths under the stars . <p> Stuart Wasserman is a Washington state free-lance writer .
