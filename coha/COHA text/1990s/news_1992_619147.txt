<p> THE ' VISION THING ' <p> Editor  --  New Hampshire should have told Bush something . I 'd like to add a little more . I am registered as a Republican , but I will vote for any Democrat who will challenge and beat George Bush . It 's the " Vision Thing "  --  really the lack of vision regarding the future of my kids , our country and our world . If humanity is going to have a viable 21st century , there are problems that George Bush is not addressing . <p> 1 . Nuclear holocaust : The fall of communism has brought our lifetime 's greatest opportunity for political cooperation and nuclear rollback . But George Bush wo n't take the lead in sending food ( beyond an airlifted token ) to stave off anarchy . A winter of starvation could lead right back to totalitarianism and resumption of the nuclear standoff . <p> 2 . The world population explosion : The second most serious problem for our future is population growth . It will lead to endless local wars , billions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . George Bush had once recognized the importance of this problem , but he caved in politically to his right-to-life constituency who tied this issue to the abortion issue . <p> 3 . Environmental degradation : The " ozone hole " is now turning out worse than anticipated  --  and global warming could easily be the same . Everybody knows that the U.S.A. is overwhelmingly the world 's biggest energy burner . And world leaders are begging us to take a leadership role in attacking this problem . Bush is stonewalling . <p> 4 . National and world economic growth : Are we going to use money to solve problems or to create problems ? Making armaments is a great business . Making cars is quite a business , too . Building castles and golf courses for billionaires is good business , too . Instead , we could be creating tremendous employment , both nationally and internationally , by tackling problems of environment , education , infrastructure , drug rehabilitation and reduction of poverty . George Bush seems to favor manipulation and the making of paper billionaires over truly productive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldwide : With democracies and free markets trying to rise from the ashes of communism , there is an overwhelming need for knowledge and skills from America . But here at home education is failing . Are there good Republicans who could admit the truth of this and suggest real solutions instead of phony ones ? <p> My own father , a good Republican born in Maine in 1894 , made it very clear to me that the worst thing you could say about any man in power was that he lacked imagination . New World Order ? It needs more imagination than George Bush will ever show . <p> W. LAWSON JONES <p> Los Altos <p> DIXVILLE NOTCH <p> Editor  --  I have been watching with both amusement and despair the total befuddlement of the American press over Libertarian Andre Marrou 's stunning victory in the Dixville Notch , N.H. , primary . <p> Marrou 's strategy was the ultimate in simplicity . He went there . He talked to them . They voted for him . <p> In the words of one voter , " ( Marrou ) just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . " This voter obviously had no problem with voting for an " unknown " who made sense . <p> Why is it then that the national media establishment has so much trouble understanding that the American people care about a lot more than who wins , that they do n't pick candidates as though they were betting on a horse race ? <p> Dixville Notch clearly tells us that people are interested in the Libertarian alternative . Given the opportunity to hear about it they are choosing it over the incumbent parties . Why then is the American press apparently doing everything it can to hinder voter efforts to learn more about us ? Why are Libertarians virtually blacked out of national media coverage unless we can pull off something like Dixville Notch ? <p> For now it appears that voters will just have to make a little more effort to become informed . So call us  --  we 're in the White Pages . <p> JUNE R. GENIS <p> Libertarian for U.S. Senate <p> Woodside <p> DRAFT CARTER <p> Editor  --  After looking at the present crop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for Jimmy Carter 's second term . Draft Carter ! <p> RICHARD Di GRAZIA <p> Albany <p> CALIFORNIA DREAMING <p> Editor  --  It is appalling that California is this country 's most populous state and yet we hold the last presidential primary ! I am tired of this state being looked upon as a money pot by presidential wannabees , who come here to fill their pockets to run campaigns which may not even make our primary when it comes dragging up in June . Californians deserve a real opportunity to shape the face of the race . <p> Californians deserve a voice ! Give us an earlier , meaningful primary ! <p> LARRY R. SHOCKEY <p> San Francisco <p> JOE DOHERTY <p> Editor  --  Well Maggie , you finally got your wish . Joe Doherty has been whisked away in the middle of the night to Northern Ireland . Ronnie , yourself , George and John , have succeeded in making Joe 's " American Dream , into a nightmare . " Of course you had help , from such noble , moralistic people like Ed Meese and Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all the people that supported " Joe 's " quest will double their efforts , to make sure that the perpetrators of this vindictive decision will not be elected to do it again . <p> PAUL BOYLE <p> San Jose <p> OZONE LAYER THREAT <p> Editor  --  The media apparently appreciates the public 's need to be aware of some of the threats to our atmosphere , as indicated by recent coverage of NASA 's reports on grave new threats to the northern ozone layer . However , the role of the Bush administration in impeding international efforts to meet the challenge are still scantily reported . <p> For example , among industrialized nations , the U.S. is virtually alone in its refusal to place specific limits on CO2 emissions . In fact , present policy would actually increase them . Have you ever pointed out that the greatest obstacle to meaningful progress has been the Bush administration ? Or that under his leadership the U.S. has : refused to agree on specific targets for reducing CO2 emissions ; has refused to commit adequate funds to assist Third World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggestions that industrialized countries , which now produce far more than their share of air pollution , must alter their energy-consumption habits ? <p> The media bears a responsibility  --  and has a unique opportunity  --  to help put these issues onto the front-burner . I am alarmed for the future of our children and those who will follow them into the 21st century if we fail to reduce our own excess emissions and to exercise effective leadership in the global community . <p> LARRY DEAN <p> MICHE BEAUDOIN <p> Concord <p> INVESTMENT <p> Editor  --  Let 's get real , human nature always works . Our country 's success and capitalism has been built on the premise that people will work in their own best interest . Give an employer a reason to hire , build in the inner city , invest in new equipment . Give our citizens a reason to save or invest in real estate and the market . Make it possible to realize a gain from investment without it all going back to big government and people will sell and buy . <p> Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against job makers and investors make this a Third World country . Kick the liberals out and give our system a chance to work again . <p> RICHARD P. WENTNER <p> Lafayette <p> HEALTH CARE DEBATE <p> Editor  --  The national debate on health-care reform has begun . It is an extremely important issue for all Americans . As politicians take control of this issue , they will no doubt seek to achieve a compromise palatable to the largest number of voters . We , the voters , need to give them our opinions . But whether you favor a privatized or a nationalized approach , you must demand that long- term care be included in the solution . The system has funded care for the frail elderly inadequately for decades . And with few speaking in their behalf , it has been easy for the politicians to ignore this invisible minority . We must not allow this national debate to avoid this most glaring weakness any longer . Let us demand of our politicians , no health care reform without long-term care . Quality long-term care , both in-patient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea Shell Communities <p> Morro Bay <p> ( San Luis Obispo County )
