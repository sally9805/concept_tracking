Last week that trust was deeply shaken when air force Brigadier General Rami Dotan , former chief of logistics and Israel 's leading expert on aircraft engines , started talking about his role in the biggest bribery scandal ever to rock the defense establishment . <P> Dotan , who was arrested in October after a lengthy investigation , has allegedly confessed to pocketing more than $10 million in kickbacks , bribes and fictitious charges from American and Israeli defense firms over an eight- year period . Four other Israelis , including the air force 's chief quartermaster , have also been detained . <P> The government says the money was siphoned from the hefty military aid that Washington gives Israel ( $1.8 billion this year ) , and officials fear the scandal will further strain relations with the U.S. Others have called for air force chief Major General Avihu Bin-Nun 's resignation .
