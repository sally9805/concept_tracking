<p> It 's in the full glory of summer that we begin to glimpse the season 's death . Perhaps a small cool breeze blows through the still-bright evening , eclipsing the scent of iris with something recognized but unidentifiable , a faint aroma of regret . Or maybe a black walnut or hickory tree , last to green , first to bare , drops one precocious leaf . In the great cities , these whispers of change would probably not be heard , but to one raised in the country , or even one whose blood has only begun to ebb and flow to rural rhythm , the hint of fall sends the body into a flush composed of equal parts of a vague loneliness and a delicious anticipation . Autumn is the season of the field and forest ; inside some of us an ancient ancestor anticipates the hunt . <p> For those new to country life , though , this eagerness may be blasted apart by a decidedly modern uncertainty . " Hell , " he or she might mutter . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Fortunately , this problem is far from difficult to solve . The selection of basic hunting arms , for the beginner , is a much simpler matter than it is for the more experienced hunter who may be stricken by the equipment mania that seems to infect just about every sport nowadays . Of course , there are a great many models among even the few firearm types discussed here , but the parameters are relatively easy to deal with . For the beginning nimrod ( or for any hunter , as many with years in the field sometimes forget ) , the important consideration is n't necessarily to have a weapon specifically designed for each and every situation , but rather to have one or more reliable , well-made guns and-here 's the key-to learn to be able to get something approaching their built-in potential from them . Paying for a Plinker <p> For a great many aging country kids , one Christmas day in late childhood or early adolescence will be forever burned into the memory because of a long box propped against the wall behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility and trust , a first sweet taste of independence , the thin edge of the wedge into a door that would one day open to adulthood . <p> The .22 is probably the ideal first gun , both for a youngster and for an adult whose interest in hunting has just surfaced . It can be used to take squirrels ( a delicious and common game animal ) and , under the right circumstances , rabbits . More important , though , this small-caliber rifle is inexpensive to shoot and neither too loud nor too physically punishing . <p> Of the several varieties of .22s available , you 'll want , first , a rifle chambered to accept the .22 long rifle cartridge rather than the underpowered .22 short or the relatively expensive .22 magnum . From there , you can choose among a variety of types of firearms . The most common of these are the single-shot , the bolt action , the semiautomatic , and the pump . Each has its purposes and its devotees , but many believe the bolt action does the best job of developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are several reasons for this . The most important is the fact that a good bolt-action .22 can effectively mimic the larger-caliber deer rifle that the same owner will most likely later acquire , and will thus give him or her counterfeit experience with the bigger gun at much less expense . <p> The bolt action , forcing the shooter to eject the spent shell manually and insert a live cartridge by manipulating the bolt after each shot , also encourages better field habits than does the semiautomatic , which allows the shooter to keep on firing as quickly as the trigger can be pulled . Do n't misunderstand ; there are many fine and conscientious marksmen who prefer the semiautomatic . Unfortunately , there are also some beginning shooters who 've been seduced by the awesome rate of fire possible with these weapons and who tend to substitute quantity of shots for quality . Searching for a Scattergun <p> If the first .22 provides a novice hunter with a ticket to the world of outdoor sport , owning a shotgun is the equivalent of a full-season pass . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States that ca n't be hunted with one of these versatile weapons . Squirrel , rabbit , waterfowl and such upland game birds as grouse , dove , quail , woodcock , and pheasant are probably the first to come to mind when one thinks of shotgunning , but load that firearm with a single rifled slug rather than small shot , and you have a very effective short-range weapon for deer or even black bear . In fact , in some parts of the country the shotgun is the only legal deer weapon . <p> Scatterguns are available in most of the varieties offered by .22 manufacturers ( pump , singleshot , bolt action , semiautomatic ) and also in side-by-side and over/under double-barreled configurations . And , to meet the challenge of multiple usage , some manufacturers now offer single-barreled scatterguns with interchangeable barrels ; one suited to firing shot and the other designed to throw a rifled slug efficiently at big game . <p> Your first decision will concern gauge . ( Gauge is to shotguns as caliber is to rifles , and reflects the number of balls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the pound . Thus a dozen 12-gauge slugs would weigh approximately one pound . ) The most common options are .410 ( which , perversely , is not a gauge but a caliber , which refers to the diameter of the bore of the firearm ) , 20-gauge , 16-gauge ( which has been in a popularity slump in recent years , so you may find it difficult to locate shells ) , and 12-gauge . <p> Each of these has advantages and disadvantages , and a shotgun enthusiast will most likely own several gauges . The .410 is light and does n't " kick " much when shot , so it 's often recommended to young or physically small shooters . It 's also by far the least effective game-taker , a fact which would suggest that you start with nothing smaller than a 20-gauge . The 20 is also a compromise , trading its easy handling for limited knockdown power . Still , in capable hands this is a very effectives hunting weapon . If you fear that the weight and kick of a larger gun would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a worthwhile first choice . Do be sure , though , to purchase a gun capable of handling 3-inch magnum shells , which give the little gun a lot more punch . <p> With the 16-gauge in limbo of sorts , the 12-gauge stands out as the most versatile of the bunch , and probably the most versatile all-around hunting weapon . Choose a single-shot if price is a major concern ; a pump or semiautomatic , preferably with interchangeable barrels , if you plan to mix small-game hunting with the pursuit of deer ; and a double either side-by-side or over/under  --  if you plan to concentrate on birds and are susceptible to the romance and nostalgia that surround these " classic " shotguns . Such recommendations are , of course , quite subjective . If possible , try to shoot a variety of guns before making a decision . <p> Finally , you 'll have to select the appropriate choke for your gun . This term refers to the degree of restriction in the muzzle of the barrel , which controls the spread of the shot . Many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ select an open pattern for , say , close-flushing grouse in tight woods , or a tighter , more distance-stable pattern for fast-flying , long-range waterfowl . If you do n't have hunting friends to turn to , let the seller know the uses you intend to put your gun to . And it 's always a good idea to get more than one recommendation . Buying ' The Big Gun ' <p> The high-powered firearms often referred to as deer rifles are used for pronghorn antelope , black bear , and even elk in addition to whitetail or mule deer . Again , there are a number of actions available , including bolt action , semiautomatic , lever-action , single-shot , and pump . As with the .22s , a good first choice is the bolt action . <p> Of the many calibers available , the first-time buyer should probably stick to either the .30-.30 , the .270 ( for long-range hunting in the open country of the West ) or the .30-06 ( probably the best choice for a do-it-all cartridge ) . There are any number of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available at any sporting-goods shop and at many country stores , while a more exotic cartridge may be difficult to find should you run short on shells while hunting . <p> Whichever deer rifle you choose , though , remember that the marksman , not the rifle , makes the shot . One of the worst possible endings to a hunt is to be left haunted with the memory of a poorly hit animal that escaped to suffer and probably die . As noted above , having a .22 similar to your deer rifle will increase your familiarity with the bigger gun at minimal cost . Take advantage of that technique , but be willing to spend the money and time it takes to become comfortable and proficient with the larger caliber , too , before you set your sights on living muscle . And Practice Makes ... <p> Put yourself a few months into the future . The last sip of coffee still smoky on your palate , you leave your car and enter the foggy mystery of a predawn field . Your coat hangs warm and comfortable on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each step feels more purposeful , stronger , than usual . Your day pack waddles a bit across your back as you step , bringing visions of a lunch to be enjoyed while snuggled up to a stump , with sunlight stroking its tree-limb tattoos across your face . On your shoulder is a firearm that long practice has decorated with the golden familiarity of all good tools . You know what it can do and what you can do with it . You may not raise it to fire all day , but a hunt that begins with a morning like this , and feelings like this , can never be considered less than a great success . <p> ILLUSTRATIONS ( 2 ) <p> <p> From The Backcountry Handbook by Mother Earth News Partners . <p>
