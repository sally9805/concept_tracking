The middle-aged man had fled Cambodia to save his family from the genocidal Khmer Rouge . Now , as he stalked furiously back and forth across the grimy patio behind a cramped bungalow in the Little Phnom Penh section of Long Beach , he saw a very different threat materializing  --  within his own family . His 14-year-old son , gang-named Flipper , and another homeboy , Slicc , 18 , were bragging to a stranger about a shoot-out . <P> " I 'm on the corner phone with my girlfriend , " Slicc recounted . " The Mexican drives up and yells , ' What set you from ? ' I yell it ai n't none of his business , and he busts three caps ( ( shoots three bullets ) ) at me . I take out my gun and bust four back . . . " At that point , the father began to wave his arms and shout . Friends of Slicc 's and Flipper 's pushed the man firmly back inside his house .

Three decades later , Cambodian immigrants seeking affordable homes arrived .

" We saw that American people had groups , white with white , black with black . We decided to become more famous . If they could steal cars and do drive-by shootings , so could we .
