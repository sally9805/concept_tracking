What is a King good for ? Perhaps no question better illustrates the political gap separating Britain from America . The British royal family is simultaneously venerated and dragged through the mud , looked up to for stability and moral authority , and disparaged as powerless and irrelevant . Imagine if Bill Clinton had to answer to Queen Elizabeth as well as Bob Dole . <P> Better yet , watch Francis Urquhart ( Ian Richardson ) face a similar problem in To Play the King , a wickedly entertaining BBC mini-series that has just debuted on PBS 's Masterpiece Theatre for a four-week run . Urquhart , the Machiavellian party hack who schemed his way to the prime ministry in the 1990 mini-series House of Cards , is now ensconced in power but facing an unexpected challenge from the newly crowned King of England . The politically naive but idealistic monarch ( modeled loosely on Prince Charles ) has taken to delivering feisty , compassionate speeches about the poor and staging canny photo ops in the ghetto  --  a campaign that is starting to turn the nation against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Royal Majesty is nothing but a royal pain . " The trouble is , he has ideas , " he tells an aide , words dripping with scorn . " He has a conscience . He wants to contribute . " <P> Surrounding this clash between King and commoner is a whirl of political intrigue . There 's a Fergie-like princess with a potentially explosive diary , a royal aide hiding a homosexual affair and assorted political tricksters , both dirty and deadly . Like its predecessor , To Play the King is a wonderfully savvy , supremely cynical picture of real-world politics that makes American efforts in the same vein ( JFK : Reckless Youth ) look like Saturday-morning cartoons . Michael Kitchen , as the King , is starchy yet appealingly human ; in its fictional way , To Play the King does more to demystify the British monarchy than any Daily Mail photos of Princess Di in the exercise gym . The face-to-face confrontations between King and Prime Minister are epic battles of wills and words worthy of George Bernard Shaw . Yet Urquhart 's monstrousness ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended Part I continues to haunt him like Banquo 's ghost . <P> With the key creative people from House of Cards returning ( writer Andrew Davies , director Paul Seed ) , To Play the King is a rare sequel that advances rather than diminishes the original . But it does n't entirely escape redundancy . Urquhart hires a pretty young political operative ( Kitty Aldridge ) who is seduced by his power just as investigative reporter Mattie Storin was in House of Cards . Urquhart 's asides to the camera , charming in the first part , become somewhat precious and predictable by the end of the second . <P> But Richardson remains a marvel ; we feast on a face that reveals everything with the arch of an eyebrow or the sag of a cheek muscle . His calculated temper tantrums are as believable as the silky menace in his most understated lines ( " I could n't possibly comment " ) . This is TV 's scariest , most alluring villain since J.R . Ewing .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
