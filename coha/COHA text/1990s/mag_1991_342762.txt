The ominous silence after distress calls from Amelia Earhart 's twin-engine Lockheed 10-E Electra in the Pacific in 1937 touched off one of aviation 's greatest mysteries . Last week the FBI confirmed that a likely clue to her last landing site had been found . It was an aluminum map case recovered by a group of aircraft archaeologists on Nikumaroro , an atoll 420 miles southeast of Howland Island , her destination . <P> The FBI analysis of the breadbox-size container revealed that its paint was a type used at the time on civilian versions of a military navigator 's case . The box could have fit exactly under the table used by Earhart 's navigator , Fred Noonan . Richard Gillespie , executive director of the International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery , which found the case , suggested that Earhart had landed on a reef . With temperatures up to 120 degrees F and no fresh water available , survival was virtually impossible .
