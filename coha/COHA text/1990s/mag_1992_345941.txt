Q. In 1991 , your first year in office , you established Connecticut 's first income tax , clashed with legislators by vetoing four attempts to overturn the levy , and in the process discovered that many residents hate you . Any regrets ? <P> A. You have regrets when you have failed policies . My policy when I came in was no income tax , but that fell apart on the rocks of fiscal fact . Obviously I would have liked to have ended up the most popular guy in the state of Connecticut . For fiscal year 1993 , I have proposed $1.1 billion in cuts from current services . But I think we took a very large step to becoming the most financially credible state in the union by reversing a decade of spend-it-but- don't-pay-for - it policies as espoused by Presidents of the U.S. <P> Q. Well , a lot of people were offended by your swift turnaround on the tax issue . You opposed it when you ran for Governor . <P> A. In the campaign I made one statement over and over : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you no new taxes . During the campaign the estimates on the deficit ranged between $50 million and $100 million . When we closed our books in June 1991 , the state had a $1 billion deficit . I would suggest to you that is a new problem . <P> Q. Were you surprised by all the anger about the new taxes ? <P> A. No . <P> Q. But 40,000 people turned out at an antitax rally . When you ventured into the crowd , you were spat on and the state police had to hustle you away . <P> A. I was surprised only at the fact that given the facts , people just walk away from them . People said , " Well , I do n't care what we owe . " Some others went way beyond the bounds of polite discourse , but nobody 's knuckling under to them . <P> Q. But both of Connecticut 's U.S. Senators said they opposed the tax , even though it was a local issue . <P> A. They were covering their political buns . <P> Q. In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial situation on both federal and state levels ? <P> A. Of course they are . But they 've been subjected to 12 years of the highest authority in the land saying you can spend it and you do n't have to pay for it . We can have wars , and we do n't have to tax for it . But now we have to take a look at the domestic devastation in the U.S. We have no financial credibility at all , and we 're going around the world begging for other nations to accommodate us . Why should they ? This nation has turned its back on children , the disabled , the poor ; it 's a horrible record out there . I 've long said that if you want to cut through all the bullshit of politicians , take a look at a budget . It tells you exactly what your priorities are . We spent a lot on the military . Now it should n't come as any mystery as to why we have difficulties given the budgets of the past 12 years . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you have the urge to tell the state residents , " Oh , grow up " ? <P> A. Well , I 've made a couple of pointed remarks about that . But the facts are bad enough ; I do n't really need to heap on much rhetoric . But people really ought to start voting in this society and stop grumbling , see the facts as they are . <P> Q. What should the Federal Government do to help states like yours ?
