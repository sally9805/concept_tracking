<p> THE LAST thing Darryl Crenshaw remembers before passing out was talking to an acquaintance on Travis Street , doing nothing , hanging out , unwittingly waiting for the alien microbes in his body to consume him . <p> Crenshaw 's world was a cycle of day-labor pools , mindless jobs , flophouses , idle time and bottles  --  too many beer bottles to count . His friends knew he was sick , though not the cause of his sickness . Within three months they watched him slowly fold into himself , a sad sack unable to muster a trace of the spirit that he usually showed . <p> Crenshaw himself knew something was terribly wrong . What had seemed in the beginning nothing more than a cold had gradually robbed him of his appetite , first for food and then for beer . He could not walk a city block without stopping to rest . Some people told him he should get checked out . Yeah , he thought , I guess . One of these days . <p> And then one day in January , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was in the VA Hospital . <p> " " They said I damn near died , " the 36-year-old Crenshaw said . <p> On this summer afternoon he was parked in a different hospital , the San Antonio Chest Hospital , to which he had been moved and where he was surrounded by a dozen men who had had similar brushes with death . They sat on worn vinyl couches and watched television or took the sun on the porch outside the ward : each a fresh casualty of a war long considered won . <p> The defeat of tuberculosis , one of mankind 's oldest scourges , was one of the great victories of modern medicine . A disease that slowly and painfully breaks down the human lungs , TB can be stopped even in advanced stages , or prevented if exposure is detected , by a thorough application of antibiotics . <p> So confident were U.S. medical bureaucracies that the disease was virtually gone that funding to fight it was gradually reduced to a trickle . A generation of doctors grew up knowing almost nothing about TB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roamed the state taking X-rays were finally retired . The big foe became cancer . And heart disease . And AIDS . <p> But a funny thing happened after the cheering died and all the sanitariums closed . TB bounced back . <p> It is now rampant in underdeveloped countries where it will claim an estimated 3 million lives this year , common in the HIV community which is particularly vulnerable , and making dangerous inroads in the poor neighborhoods of Houston , a city with a case rate now more than three times the national average . <p> Children hardest hit <p> Locally , no group has been slapped harder than children , especially young children . The Houston TB rate last year for those under the age of 4 was roughly 10 times the historical average . <p> " " We 're in trouble , and the whole thing is stupid , " said Jeff Starke , a Houston pediatrician who chairs the state health department 's TB advisory committee . " " This is not AIDS . We know exactly how to cure it . " <p> Starke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office at Texas Children 's Hospital , and what he sees disturbs him : a vast medical complex representing hundreds of millions of dollars , and beyond it hundreds of people who are getting sick needlessly every year and spreading their illness into future generations . <p> The problem , as he sees it , is utterly reducible to money , and not much money at that . <p> Controlling tuberculosis is labor-intensive work . It requires that the health department not only monitor the treatment of people with TB , but that its field workers find every person known to have been in close contact with a contagious person and give them skin tests to see if they have been infected with the organism . The average is six to eight contacts for each active case . <p> Houston 's TB control program , once comparable in effectiveness with those of Texas ' other major cities , now lags far behind . It has a hard time keeping up with active cases or catching up with contacts . <p> " " We have between 100 and 120 cases per worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it , " said Cathy Barnett , who supervises contact workers . " " All we 've been doing for the last two years is put out fires . " <p> Two statistics are particularly telling . The first is the percentage of active TB patients under health department management who continue their drug therapy for the recommended six months . <p> This is a crucial matter , so the goal set down by the state Department of Health is 95 percent . Harris County 's rate for the six months ending last Dec. 31 was 49.7 . No other urban county in Texas was below 80 percent . <p> The second statistic follows from the first . TB patients receiving treatment should convert from a contagious to non-contagious state within three months , certainly within six . <p> Again the state goal for six-month conversion is 95 percent . And again Harris County fared poorly at 34 percent . <p> " " I ca n't make excuses for the statistics , " said John Bybee , who directs the state 's Tuberculosis Elimination Division . " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . <p> They get more patients than they can handle . " <p> Business is so good at Starke 's pediatric TB clinic at Ben Taub Hospital that one of his associates has opened a clinic of her own . Some of the children they see are immigrants and probably picked up the disease in their country of birth . But many are not . <p> Last year , Houston had 41 active TB cases among children under age 4 , a rate of approximately 30 per 100,000 . Dallas and San Antonio , by comparison , had five such cases each . <p> Add in the cases among children 5 to 14 , typically a time when TB infection does not develop into disease , and the Houston rate drops only to 17.9 , still an alarmingly high figure . Historically , the national average for childhood TB ( age 14 and younger ) has been approximately 3 per 100,000 . <p> The upshot of these numbers is troubling . Since children can not by definition be longtime carriers of the TB bacteria , an increased number of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " " We have the highest rate of childhood TB of any place in the country , " Starke said . " " It 's typically four to five times the national average . This means we have one of the highest rates of transmission in the country . " He paused for a moment . <p> " " We are going to develop a whole lot of TB in the future . " <p> Relatively speaking , we already have a whole lot of TB . <p> Houston led the state by far in 1992 with 720 new , active cases reported . That translates into a rate of 42.4 per 100,000 ( compared to a U.S. rate of 10.5 ) . More bad news is suggested by 1993 data : Houston 's numbers are going up while reports from other Texas cities are down . <p> The only consolation provided by Houston 's high rate is that it finally has caught the attention of politicians and government officials . The health department recently received a budget boost of more than $ 2 million from local and federal sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients and to find those they may have infected . Whether that 's enough may not be known for a couple of years . <p> Statistics , understandably , mean a lot more to Starke than to Crenshaw , a short , slender man who like most recovering TB patients walks with some effort . <p> An amiable former Army medic , Crenshaw has lived in Houston since 1980 . He worked regularly at the Blue Ribbon rice mill on Washington until it closed in 1987 . From then it was a steady spiral down to the day-labor halls and street life . It was n't much of a life , he admits , but it was made a whole lot worse when he started getting sick last fall . <p> " " I felt real bad , " he recalled as the afternoon cartoons droned on from the TV in the corner of the hospital lounge . " " I ate very little . I could n't even think about eating . Once you 'd get food in front of you .. . just to look at it , forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Crenshaw does not know where he picked up the TB bug . A logical guess would be one of the downtown shelters where he sometimes flopped . TB is transmitted by being in close quarters with a contagious person , of whom there are likely many in the city shelters and bunkhouses . Coughing is the usual means of transmission . <p> An illness of stress <p> The good news , such as it is , is that those who receive the mycobacterium have only a 10 percent likelihood of developing disease . The bad news is that percentage rises greatly for people whose immune systems are weakened , whether by youth , old age , HIV or unhealthy living conditions . Starke calls TB an illness of stress , a barometer of social conditions . He worries that there are pockets of untreated TB in Houston . <p> Thus Darryl Crenshaw , a modern-day coal miner 's canary , warns us of spreading disease . Social commentators , whatever their politics , might find in Crenshaw a useful example . He could be typical of young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity . Or he could be typical of broken-down families headed by ineffectual parents who fail to instill a sense of responsibility . <p> But to Barbara Seaworth , a physician at the state chest hospital , he symbolizes something else : Houston . Among certain populations here , she said , the disease is epidemic . <p> " " Most of the people we get from Houston are minorities , poor , homeless , " Seaworth said . " " And they usually have incredibly advanced disease . " <p> Which makes them not only very sick , but very dangerous . TB victims do not live or work in exile . Harris County Jail guards know that ; 43 of them tested positive for TB exposure earlier this year , many of them no doubt infected by the prisoners in that overcrowded , underventilated facility . Just last month , 31 of 65 workers at a Houston solid waste facility tested positive for exposure to TB . <p> Were they infected at their job or in their home environment ? <p> Either way , the answer is not reassuring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will never hit " us , ' " Seaworth said of the bug that used to scare everybody . " " Your neighbors are n't going to be the ones cleaning your house . " <p> For the record , health department data indicates that 317 of Houston 's 582 census tracts had at least one new TB case last year . <p> LINDA WILLIAMS looked at her sleeping baby girl with a special sort of affection , one that has been hardened by a yearlong blast of indignation . When she sleeps , one can imagine what she used to be . <p> " " She was perfectly normal at 1 year old , " Williams said . <p> And is a perfect mockery of it at 2 . Blind , mentally retarded and quadriplegic , Kimberly Williams ' face is a tragic mixture of beauty and torment . Life as she might have known it ended in April 1992 when she was admitted to a hospital in Nacogdoches while running a very high fever . The underlying infection was TB , which spread quickly to her brain . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Linda 's best friend , a woman baby sitter Kimberly had while her mother worked at a nursing home . As is often the case in children , Kimberly displayed no symptoms until she became very sick . She never had a chance . Only if her potential exposure had been caught by the city health department would Linda have known to have her tested . <p> Therein lies the source of Linda 's outrage . The boyfriend had been in Harris County Jail and supposedly had been suspected of having active TB following a routine jail screening . <p> " " He was tested in jail , " she said . " " The health department did not follow through ( after he got out ) . He knew he was sick . He laughed about it later . I 'm very angry . " <p> She also is burning out . Her life changed so radically in the course of a few months she can hardly fathom it . She already was a single mother and admittedly a few steps shy of middle class , but now she can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has been reduced to poverty and now relies on public assistance . <p> " " I was brought up against it , " she said of welfare . " " I never believed in it . I worked all my life . And now I 'm having to eat my words . " It is cases like Kimberly 's that stir the already animated Starke to great fits of vituperation . Her illness is one of many that he feels would have been prevented if TB control had enough people to promptly investigate its cases . <p> Starke said he remembers being called by TB workers trying to find Kimberly . By the time they found her , it was too late . <p> " " We know children are getting sick under our noses because we 're not getting to them fast enough , " Starke said . <p> He and a colleague researched 139 pediatric TB cases between 1985-87 and found at least 25 percent to have been preventable . <p> Some of those 25 percent were serious cases . A few were fatal . <p> Others like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimberly ) , including some who have died . I 've got files of at least 30 kids with TB meningitis . Today , I saw a kid who 'd had a stroke because of TB meningitis , " Starke said . <p> Infants and toddlers are at greater risk than older children or adults of developing disease , and it 's usually a nastier , more dangerous manifestation of the disease . Fortunately , most children are luckier than Kimberly . Of Veronica Washington 's four children , each of whom had been infected with the TB organism , only her 2-year-old daughter got seriously ill . <p> " " When the sickness came down on her , she started laying around , " said Washington , which is not her real name . " " She would n't eat , would n't drink , nothing . She went from 30 pounds to 19 pounds . " Washington and her daughter went back and forth to several hospitals before a proper diagnosis was made . This is not surprising . Children do n't display the illness in the same way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until they get really sick  --  and combined with a widespread lack of familiarity with the disease by doctors , it can take a while to find out what is wrong . <p> Washington 's daughter spent a month in the hospital last November . Her 1-year-old brother spent a week . Another sister was treated for an active case . All are recovered or close to it and still on medication . <p> Everyone was infected <p> The family was infected by the father of the baby boy , Washington said . The man himself eventually ended up in the hospital , she said . No one in her crowded apartment in southeast Houston escaped infection . <p> Washington and her other daughter , as well as various other family members and friends of family members , did not get sick but had positive skin tests . They are on preventive antibiotics . <p> The medication for all of them is brought twice a week by a TB worker , who watches to make sure everyone takes it . This practice is known as directly observed therapy . TB officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it assures that the patient will complete therapy  --  or at least they will know about it if he or she does not . <p> When considering Houston 's high incidence of TB , it is not coincidental that its health department has the lowest percentage of patients on directly observed therapy of any major Texas city  - -  17 percent , according to the state department of health . If that number does not go up significantly , TB experts predict an inevitable rise in multidrug-resistant TB , which develops when patients fail to complete the full course of treatment . <p> Drug-resistant TB , expensive to treat and often fatal , is the specter on the horizon . <p> " " We 're gon na have to jump up and down to get the tools we need to do our job , " said Marilyn Metcalfe , who heads the state health department 's efforts against drug-resistant TB . <p> She said directly observed therapy must become the standard method of treating active cases , as was recently recommended by the federal Centers for Disease Control . Directly observed therapy means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower mortality rate and much less drug resistance , she said . At a Houston conference on TB in June , Metcalfe finished her presentation by displaying a cartoon . A fat dragon leaned against a tree , stuffed and content . Around him lay various spears , lances and bits of armor . <p> The caption : " " Sometimes the dragon wins . " <p> Nobody laughed . <p> DANNY HARRISON has been in every lousy shotgun shack , flophouse , crack joint and homeless shelter in Houston , or at least it seems that way . He 's been with the health department for 21 years . He calls himself the city 's " " last resort " when it comes to TB . <p> It 's his job to keep track of TB patients who are hard to keep track of . Patients who move often , who wander , who get arrested , who take drugs , who sell themselves . He is streetwise and jive fluent . <p> Harrison , 42 , leafs through the paperwork of a new case that had been tossed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> She is supposedly infectious with TB and not cooperating with health workers . <p> " " Her grandmother said the girl hates her mother , has been put out of school and needs to be placed somewhere , " Harrison says . " " Her next step is what ? To take to the streets . " Which is her business except for one thing . She is dangerously ill . <p> The other new case on his desk presents a similar problem . <p> There are two children , 4 and 5 , who are believed to have been infected by their mother 's boyfriend . They had moved , however , and health workers could not find them . It is Harrison 's job to talk to the boyfriend , who was in Harris County Jail , and convince him to provide their new address . <p> He is confident the man will tell him . He knows how to talk to people like that , he says . <p> A man with an attitude <p> " " You ca n't walk up to the door with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got kind of a rapport even with people in the crack neighborhoods . People know I 'm trying to help them . If they 're on crack , I do n't give a damn . " Later in the day , as if to prove his point , Harrison drives to what he calls " " crack town , " a narrow slice of the Fifth Ward . <p> He stops his Ford Bronco in front of a small , dirty frame house . <p> " " This is one of my crack houses , " he says . <p> Two dissolute young men sit on the sagging porch . They begin to stir uneasily as the vehicle stops . He gets out and asks them about someone he used to monitor who lived in the house . The answer is noncommittal . <p> Before he can leave , a female cry comes from across the street . <p> " " Danny ! Danny ! " shouts a woman who comes running up to the Blazer . Harrison gets out and gives her a hug . She 's a hooker on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her some condoms and inquires after her best friend , who has been sent to a hospital in Tyler with TB . <p> " " You keeping a low profile ? " he asks . <p> " " Do n't you know it , " she says . " " Ai n't been nothing . The neighborhood 's been real peaceful and quiet . " <p> " " I 'll be checking with you , " he says and drives on . He cruises down Jensen , where the hookers hang out , and then over to Brackenridge . He pulls up in front of one of a handful of shotgun shacks . <p> A woman he introduces as Miss Green walks up to chat . She is a recovered TB patient . She begins talking about the woman next door , Miss Lillian , who lives with her grandson . Miss Lillian is 57 and makes a little money taking care of an older woman . Miss Lillian is very sick , Miss Green says . <p> " " Somebody needs to help her , " Miss Green says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose . I tell her , " What you gon na do with that boy if you die ? What you gon na do when they pull up out front with the sheriff and you have to go ( to the hospital ) ? ' " She says Miss Lillian has been to the clinic but does not take her TB medicine regularly . <p> " " She ca n't walk 10 feet without coughing and pissing . " <p> Harrison promises to have someone check up on her and then heads over to the Do Drop Inn , a nondescript one-story building on Austin Street just south of downtown . As he gets out , a shirtless man with a large , scarred belly and a cut on his forehead greets him . <p> " " I know that crippled son of a bitch , " the man bellows , referring to Harrison 's limp and cane , the result of an auto accident . <p> The man goes on and on , talking about the shots he used to get for TB every day from a nurse . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often could not keep them down . <p> " " I wanted to haul off and pop her , " he says , " " and I would have too if she had n't been so pretty . " <p> " Do n't cross me ' <p> Harrison moves on past him . As he gets inside , he admits to not liking the fellow . At the beginning of his treatment , they 'd had a difficult time . <p> " " I 'm cool , " Harrison says , " " but do n't cross me , and do n't cuss me . " <p> The Do Drop Inn is a bunkhouse for men . The smell of disinfectant does not entirely mask a stale odor . In the sleeping quarters , bunk beds are jammed tightly end to end . The walkway between them is perhaps 3 feet wide . The ceiling is low , a few feet above the top bunk . <p> One might as well have designed the place for the transmission of tuberculosis . <p> " " Smitty , " a patient Harrison has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills , the whole fistful of them , every day . He is no longer contagious . Although the Do Drop 's owner works with the health department to keep out sick people , it 's an impossible goal . <p> Asked if there are others staying there who might have TB , Smitty says yes . <p> " " You see them coughing , " he says in a voice made gravelly by drink , TB or perhaps just a hard life . " " But you do n't say nothing . You do n't want to be telling no one he 's got TB . " <p> The city health department offered voluntary skin tests to Do Drop Inn residents at the end of June . Of the 20 who accepted , 11 tested positive for TB . <p> From the Do Drop it 's a quick spin by the corner of Preston and Crawford where the street bums hang out . Harrison says he knows them all , an exaggeration , perhaps , but given the infiltration of TB into their ranks , not much of one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop by the Thomas Street Clinic , an AIDS clinic , to touch base with one of the caseworkers . She immediately confronts him with a question about a patient named Jose . <p> " " Have you seen him ? " she asks . " " Is he dead ? He 's got violent TB . " Harrison says he has n't seen him . <p> The caseworker talks about her fear of getting the disease and of precautions she feels the clinic does not take . Her mother used to be a nurse , and was assigned to work with the TB patients . <p> In time she caught it herself and had to spend a year in a sanitarium . <p> The caseworker wonders if this disease will ever be taken seriously . <p> " " This TB has to go and hit the middle class to hit home with the powers that be , " the caseworker says . " " They see poor people , the working class , street people , prostitutes and let it go . That 's the attitude I get from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Once considered conquered , tuberculosis has made a comeback since the mid-1980s . The disease is particularly pronounced among the homeless and those with HIV , and is making inroads in many inner-city areas . Houston 's TB control program , which was once on par with those in other Texas cities , started falling behind in 1989 and has never recovered .
