Maybe the happiest moment of David Mixner 's life came a year ago , when he introduced his old friend Bill Clinton to 700 celebratory gays at the Hollywood dance club Palace . This was going to be the first President to fight for gay civil rights , and Mixner was going to be his main man on those issues , advising and orchestrating outreach the way he does for Fortune 500 companies in his thriving business life . The candidate , for whom Mixner helped raise $3.5 million in gay support , responded passionately . " I have a vision of the future , and you are a part of it . " <P> A more ambivalent moment in Mixner 's life came this month , when Clinton became the first President to meet with an all-gay group at the White House . Mixner was n't there , in part because of his own suggestion that the invitations go to the heads of major gay organizations . Yet his absence was symbolically correct . He has damaged his relationship with Clinton , some people fear irreparably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just when Mixner seemed poised to become the unofficial head of a community that has never had a Martin Luther King Jr . or a Jesse Jackson  --  although plenty of Eldridge Cleavers and Al Sharptons  --  he ceased to be its pre-eminent symbol of mainstream access to power .

Do they settle for whatever he offers , recognizing that other quarters of government are bound to be less helpful ? Or do they fight for what they want and risk alienating their vital ally ? <P> For Mixner , the decision to speak up was painful but inescapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than other gay leaders by the postelection outcry against Clinton 's proposal to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military , which caused barely a murmur during the campaign . Rather than demand that the President sign an Executive Order as pledged , Mixner collaborated with the White House in shaping a compromise . <P> Mixner was aghast , however , when Clinton offhandedly suggested that he might be open to treating gays in uniform differently from heterosexuals : giving them special assignments or separate accommodation , and requiring them to keep their sexual preference in the closet . This idea would have denied gays what they seek and what their critics want to withhold : recognition as a legitimate part of the community . Mixner telephoned the White House repeatedly to express his disapproval , but his calls were not returned . When he spoke at a gay- oriented church and agreed to appear on ABC 's Nightline , a White House aide tried to scare him off with implicit threats of ostracism . But at a subsequent meeting with gay leaders , Clinton left them optimistic that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
