The Set : Spiderwoman 's vision was to have a space out in the ether , a place where time was diffused , a place where long distances were short , short distances shorter or longer , somewhat like the light of a star flickering through the eons . There is a large backdrop which curve down to the floor . It is a sky blue with an infinite spiral painted on it which becomes a road . There are three legs cut out in the shape of abstract trees which are also painted with gold spirals . USC there is a hammock because the Kuna people use them and also to create that suspension in space . A chime is attached to the hammock to create incidental sound . We were always told that clicks , breezes and sound were the spirits talking to you . DSL , there is a round tea table with 3 chairs with the Spiderwoman drop , a large drop made of quilts , surrounding it . There is a large Cochiti drum USL with 3 stools around it . Our drum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we perform , we bless the drum . It is placed on a special blanket , never on the bare floor . The women of Spiderwoman are at an age where we feel we can sit at the drum . Spiderwoman is at an age where it is important to listen to the heartbeat of all our communities and the drum is our heartbeat . ( The preshow music is Pow Wow music , Grand Entry . As the lights and music go down , we hear Kakik Bali , Balinese music . The Balinese music is interrupted by the Noise Band #1 in the dark . Lisa is " playing " an aluminum garbage can , Gloria , a toy violin and Muriel , a heavy chain . First , Muriel throws the heavy chain and yells a continuous sound , the others join in . Out of the sound comes the first words ) GLORIA Elizabeth ! p. 3 MAYO What ? GLORIA What was that ? MAYO Where 's Muriel ? MURIEL I have to pee ! MAYO Not now , not now !
