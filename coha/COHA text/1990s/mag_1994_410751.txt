April 28 , 1993 , Air Force 2nd Lt. Jeannie Flynn took her place among the first women in the history of the military to be assigned to fly combat aircraft . Since 1948 , women officially had been banned from serving in combat positions in the American armed forces . Pres. Clinton and Secretary of Defense Les Aspin announced the new policy , effectively removing one of the last major barriers to their full utilization in the military , though they still are barred from participating in ground combat . This historic change did not come about by chance . For more than two centuries , women have played a role in the American armed forces . Their stories of courage , dedication , sacrifice , and valor are a part of the fabric of the nation 's history . Nearly 2,000,000 women have served since the Revolutionary War , each a pioneer in the march toward progress and equality . American Revolution , In 1782 , 25-year-old Deborah Sampson decided to enlist in the Continental Army by disguising herself as a man . She became Pvt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one raid , the company encountered a band of Tories outside of White Plains , N.Y . In the ensuing battle , she engaged in hand-to-hand combat , receiving her first wound , a saber slash across the left side of the head . A few weeks later , the company was ambushed at East Chester , Pa . In a bloody battle , the Americans fought their way free , but not before Shurtleff took a musket ball in the thigh . The location of the wound made Shurtleff dread that doctors would learn her secret , so she called out to her comrades that she was mortally wounded and should be left on the battlefield . Not heeding her words , they carried her to safety to a field hospital . At the field station , the doctors were overwhelmed with injured soldiers , and Shurtleff crawled off into the woods to treat her wound in privacy . She hid out for several days , washing and dressing the wound . She returned to the camp later , with the musket ball still imbedded in her thigh , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical care . She was transferred to Philadelphia to serve as an orderly to Maj. Gen. John Paterson and was struck down with a fever that was sweeping the city . After she became unconscious , her identity finally was discovered by the surprised doctor who treated her . Gen. George Washington was notified of the situation and Pvt . Robert Shurtleff was given an honorable discharge . In addition to the numerous recorded incidents of females disguising themselves as men to fight in the American Revolution , they served as nurses , cooks , and camp helpers . It was a common and accepted practice for wives , mothers , and daughters to go along with their men when they went off to war , helping out in a myriad of ways in the camps and on the field of battle . Civil War . During the Civil War , women on both sides , black and white , served in a variety of capacities  --  as color bearers , saboteurs , spies , nurses , cooks , and scouts . When the war broke out , Dr. Mary Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D.C. , seeking an appointment as an army surgeon . The Army Surgeon General rejected her application because she was a woman , even though there was a shortage of doctors . She became a nurse instead and eventually served at tent hospitals in Warrenton and Fredericksburg , Va . Walker pursued her volunteer work and , when there were lulls in the fighting , would travel behind enemy lines to treat the wounded . It was during one of these mercy missions that she overheard some Confederate officers discussing various strategies against Union Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman . She reported back and was able to avert a costly battle for the Union troops . On April 10 , 1864 , while on another of her " spy " missions , Walker was captured . She was imprisoned by the Confederate Army in Castle Thunder until the following August , when she was exchanged for a male prisoner held by the Union Army . Walker became the only woman to receive the Congressional Medal of Honor , the U.S. 's highest military decoration , for her service to the Union Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescinded the Medal , and her name was stricken from the rolls . She refused to give it up and wore it until her death . In 1977 , her medal was restored posthumously . Spanish-American War . During the Spanish-American War of 1898 , an epidemic of yellow fever prompted the recruitment of women by the Army under a civilian contract . Clara Louise Maass responded to the call for nurses and worked in fever-ridden camps throughout the South and in Cuba . George M. Sternberg , Surgeon General of the U.S. Army , was desperately seeking a cure for the disease . He and Maj. Walter Reed agreed to experiment , using human beings to prove their theory that mosquitoes were responsible for the spread of yellow fever . In 1900 , they traveled to Havana for volunteers . Maass offered to be bitten by the mosquito Stegomyia , suspected as a carrier , in order that she might help , in her words , " to add to man 's knowledge of the disease and to be a better nurse . " She died on Aug. 21 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only American to succumb to the test . Her death established the fact that yellow fever was carried by mosquitoes . From the knowledge gained , doctors were able to control the disease and pave the way for the construction of the Panama Canal . The performance of the 1,500 nurses who served during the Spanish-American War led to the formation of the Army Nurse Corps in 1901 and the Navy Nurse Corps in 1908 . World War I. When U.S. involvement in World War I became inevitable , the Nurse Corps was organized , but full military status would not be accorded women until much later . Throughout the conflict , approximately 23,000 Army and Navy nurses served in field , mobile , evacuation , base , and convalescent hospitals , as well as on troop trains and transport ships , with more than 10,000 of them sent overseas . Although there were no official combat deaths recorded , more than 200 died of illness , most of them from the influenza epidemic that swept through the field hospitals . World War I also was the first time enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. armed forces were Navy yeomen . There was a problem that had to be overcome , however . While Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels needed women to serve as clerical staff or yeomen , by law , all yeomen had to be able to serve at sea  --  and , also by law , women were prohibited to serve on board ships . Daniels solution was to assign " yeomanettes " to ships that had been sunk . Beginning in March , 1917 , approximately 11,000 women enlisted in the Navy . They served as Marine Reservists and Coast Guard yeomen as well , mostly as clerks , translators , and radio electricians . In 1917 , Gen. John J. Pershing requested bilingual enlisted women to serve with the American Expeditionary Forces overseas on the front line as telephone operators . The existing laws only permitted females to join the Army as nurses . However , 223 civilian women volunteered to serve with the AEF in France and England as telephone operators under contract with the Signal Corps , starting in March , 1918 . They became known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all enlisted women were transferred to inactive status in 1919 and eventually discharged . The number of nurses was reduced to peacetime levels . World War II . When World War II loomed on the horizon , females were called on again . In 1942 , the Women 's Army Auxiliary Corps ( WAAC , later the Women 's Army Corps ) was formed and women soon were in all branches of the service . The first class of female officers in the history of the U.S. armed forces assembled for training at Ft . Des Moines , Iowa , in July , 1942 . In her speech to the new recruits , Col. Oveta Culp Hobby , the first WAAC director , noted : " You are the first women to serve . Never forget it . You have just made the change from peacetime pursuits to wartime tasks  --  from the individualism of civilian life to the anonymity of mass military life . You have given up comfortable homes , highly paid positions , leisure . You have taken off silk and put on khaki . And all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a date . A debt to democracy , a date with destiny .... In the final analysis , the only testament free people can give to the quality of freedom is the way in which they resist the forces that peril freedom . " Nearly 400,000 women  --  all volunteers  --  answered the call to " free a man to fight . " As the world soon discovered , they were not impervious to the dangers of war . As combat progressed in the Pacific Theater , the Japanese forced U.S. personnel to begin evacuation from the Philippines . Eventually , the remaining Americans there . including 77 nurses , had to surrender and became prisoners of war . These women were held for three years before they were released , unharmed , but significantly thinner than when captured . In America , as the war continued and manpower was scarce , females were recruited to form the Women Airforce Service Pilots ( WASP ) . They flight-tested aircraft , towed targets for anti-aircraft practice , and ferried planes . Jacqueline Cochran , the founder of the WASP , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to break the sound barrier in 1953 . At the time of her death in 1980 , she held more official flight records than any other pilot , male or female . The 1948 passage of the Women Armed Services Integration Act finally established a permanent place for females in the Army , Navy , Air Force , Marine Corps , and Coast Guard . Korea . On July 5. 1950 , within four days of the first U.S. troops landing in Korea , 57 Army nurses arrived at Pusan to help set up a hospital . A few days later , a contingent of nurses moved forward with a MASH ( mobile army surgical hospital ) unit to Taejon on the war zone 's perimeter . Less than a month after the hostilities began , there were more than 100 nurses on duty in South Korea . Due to their proximity to the war zone and the number of nurses serving flight duty , there were several female casualties in Korea , These included four Air Force and 11 Navy nurses , as well as Genevieve Smith , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chief Army Nurse in Korea . Army nurse Eunice Coleman received a Bronze Star for her bravery and dedication in the evacuation of wounded Americans from Seoul to Japan , and flight nurse Juanita Bonham was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross . The Integration Act was meant to ensure a permanent place for females in the military . Nevertheless , other than nurses , women were afforded few opportunities in Korea to serve in the variety of roles that they had filled during World War II . Vietnam . More than 7,500 women served in Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia in land-based medical facilities and aboard hospital ships and aeromedical evacuation aircraft . They also were utilized in logistics , intelligence , and other administrative areas . Nurses in Vietnam faced a great deal of enemy fire , but often felt defenseless because they were not given the proper military training . In January , 1965 , four Navy nurses were the first American women to receive the Purple Heart in Vietnam when they were injured during a Viet Cong terrorist bombing . Army nurse Sharon A. Lane was killed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 312th Evacuation Hospital in Chu Lai . Her name is among eight women commemorated on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington , D.C. Desert Storm , More than 40,000 women served in the Persian Gulf during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm , the largest single female deployment in military history . In the Gulf , the line between combat and non-combat was difficult to draw because of the high-technology weapons available . Five of the 13 women casualties during the conflict were killed in action  --  in a campaign that saw relatively little action , all told . Two women also were taken prisoner . On Feb. 27 , 1991 , Maj. Rhonda Cornum , serving as a flight surgeon assigned to the 2nd Battalion , 229th Attack Helicopter Regiment , was aboard a Black Hawk utility helicopter responding to a request for search-and-rescue of an Air Force F-16 pilot shot down behind enemy lines deep in Iraq . The crew of eight was within a few miles of the downed airman 's position when the helicopter was brought down by intense anti-aircraft and automatic weapons fire . Five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were taken prisoner by Iraqi forces . After escaping the crash with two broken arms , a broken finger , a gunshot wound , torn knee ligaments , and other injuries , Cornum did not receive medical treatment for several days , as she was moved from one Iraqi headquarters to another . After her release , she acknowledged sexual abuse at the hands of her captors , noting , however , that of all the bad things that can happen to a prisoner of war , that was just one more . It was women 's performance in the Persian Gulf that led the American public , Congress , and the Department of Defense to re-evaluate the policy on females in combat . Inarguably , they have served with great courage and routinely have been exposed to the dangers of combat , without receiving the advanced opportunities and recognition that come with such duty . America 's servicewomen , whether on duty during peacetime or times of conflict , are an integral and valued part of the nation 's military force . For the women of today and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blazed the trail and unlocked the doors . From now on , truly , the sky is no limit . Brig . Gen. Wilma L.
