Section : report on reports Synthesis Panel of the Committee on Science , Engineering , and Public Policy U. S. National Academy of Sciences , National Academy of Engineering , and the Institute of Medicine <p> The 1972 United Nations Conference on the Human Environment , held in Stockholm , placed the environment on the international agenda . The United Nations Conference on Environment and Development ( UNCED ) , held in Rio de Janeiro this past June , attempted to find a viable and equitable balance between environmental and developmental concerns . Over the past 20 years , too little has been done to make these concerns an essential part of economic planning and the decisionmaking process . The leading nations of the world , especially the United States , are being called upon to take practical measures now because the world can not afford another 20 years of inaction . <p> Concerned about the problems of global warming , the U.S. Congress in 1988 called for a National Academy of Sciences ( NAS ) study of global climate change . In response , an NAS Synthesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Policy prepared a report not only reflecting its own deliberations but also summarizing the main results of the NAS panels on climate change effects , mitigation , and adaptation . According to synthesis panel chairman Daniel J. Evans , a former U.S. senator and governor of the state of Washington , <p> The report identifies what should be done now to counter potential greenhouse warming or deal with its likely consequences . The recommendations of the Synthesis Panel , if followed , should provide the United States with a framework for responding to this very important concern. 1 <p> After a brief introduction , the report of the synthesis panel presents in chapters 2 and 3 the usual account of the nature of the greenhouse effect and the possible changes to be expected . There is also a valuable appendix with 55 questions and answers about the greenhouse effect . Chapter 4 gives an overview of the policy framework , including a discussion of the mitigation and adaptation options , which are elaborated in some detail in chapters 5 and 6 . The international aspects of greenhouse warming are discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ findings and , on the basis of the conclusions , provide specific recommendations , including reducing or offsetting greenhouse-gas emissions , enhancing adaptation to a warmer world , evaluating engineering options , improving knowledge , and exercising leadership . <p> The first three chapters of the report are supposed to familiarize the reader with the kind of factual information necessary to appreciate the subsequent , more policy-oriented parts . Apart from overly cautious wordings and generalities-such as " the possible warming due to increased concentrations .... continued increases in atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases would affect the earth 's radiation balance and might cause . . . additional greenhouse warming " - there is very little factual information in the NAS report . The panel , however , could have cited many observations. 2 For example , from 1949 to 1989 , there was a 0.5 degrees C increase in tropical sea surface temperature with a concomitant increase in evaporation of about 16 percent ; over the past 20 years , mean surface wind speed has increased by 20 percent in the tropics , by 9 percent in the midlatitudes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kilometers ; between 1966 and 1989 , the relative frequency of storms increased from 18 to 26 percent for the Icelandic Low and from 17 to 32 percent for the Aleutian Low ; snow cover on the continents of the Northern Hemisphere has decreased by about 8 percent since 1973 ; the mass of Alpine glaciers has decreased by about 50 percent since 1850 ; and satellite data clearly show a retreat of glacier tongues on Greenland and a significant reduction in the extent of sea ice north of Greenland between 1978 and 1987 . All of these facts are significant indications of ongoing changes in the climate system that , at least , should have been mentioned . <p> Moreover , important new findings have been summarized by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. 3 The following findings should have been at least briefly reported by the NAS panel : Ozone depletion in the lower stratosphere of the middle and high latitudes is believed to have offset approximately the radiative forcing caused by chlorofluorocarbons ( CFCs ) and halons during the past decade ; the cooling effect of sulfur aerosols @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset some of the greenhouse warming in the Northern Hemisphere during the past decades ; and the otherwise useful concept of global warming potential ( GWP ) has recently come under fire because of an increase in uncertainty about the calculation of the different average lifetimes of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere , the gases ' heat-trapping abilities , and their indirect chemical effects . <p> The NAS report presents tables with greenhouse-gas emission data , especially for carbon dioxide ( CO , ) . It is important that the various contributions by the different countries are clearly spelled out . For example , in 1986 , the largest C02 emissions were made by the United States ( 24 percent ) , the USSR ( 19 percent ) , China ( 10 percent ) , and both Germanies ( 5 percent ) ; East Germany and the United States each emitted almost 20 tons Of C02 per capita-30 times higher than the rate for India ; and from 1950 to 1986 , the United States contributed 29 percent , the USSR contributed 17 percent , and the combined Germanies and China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the atmosphere . This information is important for equitable burden sharing . <p> For quite some time , it has been known that there are large discrepancies in the available data sets on CO , emission by fuel and country . The report should have at least acknowledged this problem and , perhaps , suggested a remedy . For example , the 1986 C02 emissions listed in Table 1 on this page differ by up to 37 percent between the data sets . For 1988 , the difference is somewhat smaller . The differences stem from such factors as whether bunker fuel use and the oxidation of nonfuel products are accounted for and from accounting difficulties . Differences may also occur within the same country ; the 1987 total West German C02 emission data collected by six different research outfits and agencies range from 716 million to 736 million tons , and for the transportation sector , range from 137 million to 16 million tons4 Because all of the agencies used the same official energy-consumption data , the differences can only b explained by the use of different computation methods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversion factors , which depend on the heating value , the amount of fugitive substances , the sulfur and ash content , and the ignition point of the respective fossil fuels . <p> At present , nobody knows which of the " official " data sets is the most accurate , and perhaps none of the national emission inventories conducted so far is totally correct . Surely , this is an unbearable situation in view of the emission reduction quotas , target setting , and burden sharing that are required to reduce the risks of global warming . The Framework Convention on Climate Change signed at UNCED requires the development of reliable and comparable data sets as well as the preparation of national emission inventories . Therefore , the harmonization of data sets should have a very high priority . <p> Chapters 4 , 5 , and 6 deal with the Policy framework and the available policy options- Three types of options are considered : options that eliminate or reduce greenhouse-gas emissions ; options that offset emissions by removing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere or by altering the Earth 's heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust or adapt to new climatic conditions . The first and second options constitute mitigation that takes effect at the onset of climatic change . The third option is adaptation , whose effects come into play after the climate has changed . The report claims that taking steps now to prevent future impacts is not justifiable given the ability of U.S. industry and agriculture to adjust and given human adaptability . This egocentric U.S. perspective is based in part on the availability of high technology and may not be applicable to the Third World , where present problems of poverty , hunger , and migration are expected to be aggravated by increased greenhouse warming . <p> Many countries , however , favor the mitigation options and press for a specific timetable for CO , emission reductions . According to the latest count of the International Energy Agency , 5 the following countries endorse a stabilization of CO , emissions by 2000 at the 1990 level : Australia , Canada , Finland , France , Japan , Norway , Sweden , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom . The following countries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the year 2005 as compared to the level of 1990 or an earlier date : Australia ( 20 percent ) , Austria ( 20 percent ) , Belgium ( 4 percent ) , Denmark ( 20 percent ) , Germany ( 25 to 30 percent ) , Italy ( 20 percent ) , the Netherlands ( 20 to 25 percent ) , and New Zealand ( 20 percent ) . There are also some countries , however , that want to increase their emissions , including Greece ( 15 percent ) , Ireland ( 15 percent ) , Portugal ( 25 percent ) , and Spain ( 25 percent ) . The official <p> U.S. Position is to wait and make no commitments until studies show how those commitments could be achieved and what the economic impacts would be . The question is : Is the Bush administration 's position justified ? <p> On the basis of a detailed cost-effectiveness assessment , the report concludes that greenhouse-gas emissions in the United States could be reduced or offset at a very reasonable cost . For example , increased building and vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 300 million tons , respectively , and still save money . Industrial energy management , transportation system management , and power-plant heat rate improvements could , at a net benefit or low cost ( between $1 and $9 per ton of CO , equivalent ) , result in a reduction of 500 million , 50 million , and 50 million tons of C02 , respectively . Landfill-gas collection , halocarbon emission reduction , and agricultural improvements could reduce another 200 million , 1,400 million , and 200 million tons of C02 equivalent , respectively , at low cost . At low to moderate cost ( between $10 and $99 per ton of CO , equivalent ) , reforestation would sequester about 200 million tons and electric utilities could avoid emitting another 1,000 million tons . The 1988 C02-equivalent emissions of the United States amounted to a little more than 10,000 million tons , based on emissions of C02 , methane , nitrogen dioxide , and CFC 11 and 12 . Thus , the NAS analysis suggests that the United States could reduce its greenhouse-gas emissions by about 36 percent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 percent at low or moderate cost . <p> The Congressional Office of Technology Assessment has calculated that the United States can reduce CO , emissions by 35 percent by 2015 , while using only currently available technologies and assuming no sacrifices of convenience or comfort. 6 In the worst case , such a policy would cost the United States some $150 billion per year , a sum slightly more than what is currently being spent on all measures to control pollution . If fuel prices rose substantially in the future , this policy could also save the nation some $20 billion a year . Furthermore , a study coordinated by the Union of Concerned Scientists has found that , although cutting CO , emissions by 70 percent until 2030 would cost the U.S. economy some $2.7 trillion , taking the waste out of the energy-economic system would reduce fuel and utility bills by $5 trillion. 7 <p> A study for the Natural Resources Defense Council has shown that policies and programs already introduced by the U.S. government will stabilize CO , emissions at the 1990 level by 2000 at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrealistically high 3.2 percent per year from 1990 to 2000. 8 Building and industrial efficiency measures and transportation policy measures , as well as the pending National Energy Strategy , would reduce U.S. C02 emissions by more than 1 . 1 billion tons . The greatest reductions are expected from building-efficiency improvements ( about 444 million tons ) and industrial efficiency measures ( about 400 million tons ) . All of this would be more than enough to reach the stabilization goal . <p> A study by the U.S. Department of Energy ( DOE ) has found that a tax of $500 per ton of carbon emissions would be required to reduce the U.S. emission level to 20 percent below the 1990 level by 2000. 9 No other study c@ms such high perton reduction costs . Given its exorbitant cost assumption , DOE says that the required tax would drop to between $28 and $42 per ton of carbon if it were combined with a tree-planting program . Most top-down macroeconomic analyses such as that of DOE find that , by definition , emission reductions incur additional costs , whereas bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The substantial differences between the two approaches are brought out by an analysis that compared 11 end-use efficiency measures and supply strategies that save energy and reduce CO , emissions at a given net benefit or cost with the DOE C02 emission forecast of 1.7 billion tons of carbon for the year 2000. 10 The forecast assumes 2.5 percent real economic growth . In the DOE approach , U.S. carbon emissions would result in an increase of 200 million tons by 2000 - 13 percent more than in 1988 . In contrast , the introduction of the 11 policy strategies would lead to a reduction of 170 million tons by 2000-11 percent less than in 1988 . At an average economic benefit ( savings ) of $231 per ton of carbon , the strategies lead to an overall savings of close to $40 billion . Moreover , this study reflects only 11 specific end-use efficiency improvements available over a 1O-year period ; renewable supply-side strategies were not included . <p> In light of these U.S. studies , the obstructive stance of the official U.S. delegation on the international circuit is hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very conducive to encouraging cooperation from countries whose financial and technological potential is much less than that of the United States . <p> The calamitous official U.S. position is somewhat reflected in the report 's final chapter of recommendations in that the panel has sorted the response strategies into five categories with leadership in last place . The categories are reducing or offsetting greenhouse-gas emissions ; enhancing adaptation to greenhouse warming ; improving knowledge for future decisions ; evaluating geoengineering options ; and exercising international leadership . But in a world in which the impoverished South is struggling for survival and Eastern Europe is trying to pull itself hack together after its ideological and economic collapse , the world needs strong leadership that can only come from the United States , which is the only real world power left today . The lack of U.S. leadership and the refusal to make concrete commitments to help solve global problems are only exceeded by the paucity of the panel 's two recommendations on U.S. leadership , which are that the United States should " resume full participation in international programs to slow population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other support " and should " participate fully with officials at an appropriate level in international agreements and in programs to address greenhouse warming , including diplomatic conventions and research and development efforts . " <p> Unless the United States reverses its decision not to support financially and morally international birth-control programs , there will not be any noticeable progress . Also , unless the nation that has most induced global climatic change gives up its obstruction of specific reduction commitments , there will be only a small chance for the joint effort needed to reverse the adverse trends . From a panel as influential as this one , one might have expected clear and strong recommendations on these vital matters . <p> The world has drifted apart into rich and poor countries , and the gap between these two groups is widening . Indications are that only through growth reduction , redistribution , and sharing on an equitable basis can this division be overcome. 11 These three are at the heart of international cooperation and partnership involving the transfer of technology , the provision of new and additional funds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resource use . If the South is expected to contribute to sustainable development , the North has to transfer , free of charge ( because it is in its own best interest ) , socially benign and environmentally safe and sound technologies in the areas of environment , energy , transportation , agriculture , and forestry . Appropriate training of scientific , technical , and managerial personnel on the new technologies , equipment , and installations is also vital . Moreover , the North has to guarantee fairer terms of trade and must open its markets to the South . <p> The sustainable survival of this world is estimated to cost several hundred billion dollars per year . The South does not see itself in a position to make much of a contribution to save the environment without substantial new and additional financial resources from the North . According to UNCED estimates , some $70 billion would have to be transferred annually . But the North refuses to commit itself even to one-tenth of this amount . The United Nations ' goal for official aid from the North is 0.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 , this bench mark was only exceeded by Norway ( 1.17 percent ) , the Netherlands ( 0.94 percent ) , Denmark ( 0.93 percent ) , Sweden ( 0.90 percent ) , and France ( 0.79 percent ) . The richest countries , such as Germany ( 0.42 percent ) , Japan ( 0.31 percent ) , Switzerland ( 0.31 percent ) , and the United States ( 0.21 percent ) , fall shamefully short of the target . <p> If the world continued its past wasteful course into the future , increased fossil fuel use and population growth would be among the most decisive influencing factors determining future global warming . In 1987 , the North , with only about 26 percent of the world 's population , contributed some 74 percent of the world 's C02 emissions. 12 Carbon dioxide emissions in the industrialized countries amounted to about 12.9 tons Of C02 per capita , while , in the developing countries , the emission rate was only some 1.4 tons of CO , per capita . Equity demands redistribution . The decisive question is : To what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered and the developing countries be lifted ? <p> One of the most authoritative studies of developing countries states that it would be feasible to double final commercial energy use from the current rate of 0.55 kilowatts per capita to about 1 kilowatt per capita by 2020 and that this increase would provide enough energy services not only to satisfy all basic needs but also to raise the developing countries ' standards of living to the level found in Western Europe in the 1970s. 13 ( The current corresponding values are about 4 kilowatts per capita in Western Europe and about 10 kilowatts per capita in the United States. ) 14 Unfortunately , this increase translates into an almost threefold rise in C02 emissions from the current 4.7 billion tons to 12.7 billion tons . This rise would be due mainly to the developing countries ' population , which is expected almost to double by 2020 , and to the type of fossil fuel mix changes considered. 15 <p> If a warming rate of 0.1 degrees C per decade is taken as the limiting criterion for natural terrestrial ecosystems to migrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce world C02 output by 50 percent by 2050 ( relative to the level in 1987 ) and to reduce the C02 output by the industrialized countries by 60 to 80 percent , if an increase of a little more than 30 percent in the emissions of developing countries is to be conceded . ( This calculation was done with the Muenster Climate Model , using appropriate emission changes for the other greenhouse gases . ) Finally , translating the total emission values into per-capita values shows that the protection of the ecosystems requires that , between 1987 and 2050 , percapita CO , emissions be reduced from 12.9 tons to 2.5 tons in the industrialized countries , from 1.4 tons to 0.8 tons in the developing countries , and from 4.5 tons to 1.1 tons in the total world . This is due to the differences in the countries ' projected population growth rates . Ecosystem protection clearly demands a convergence to smaller per-capita C02 emissions , with drastic reductions in the North but also some reduction in the South . This fact drives home the dynamics of strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the required protection of ecosystems is not compatible with an inefficient energy economy based largely on fossil fuel use . Growth , equity , and the redistribution of wealth are among humanity 's most vital problems that need immediate and constant attention . <p> UNCED , however , was only the beginning of a long process . The most difficult negotiations still lie ahead , and the time left is perhaps only the remainder of this decade . Getting through these trying times will require excellent advice based on the available collective knowledge of the scientific community . Such guidance should have been expected from such a prestigious body as this NAS panel . Unfortunately , the great opportunity was missed . On the international scene , the world is now demanding U.S. leadership , not naysaying . <p> NOTES <p> Synthesis Panel of the Committee on Science , Engineering , and Public Policy , Policy Implications of Greenhouse Warming ( Washington , D.C. : National Academy Press , 1991 ) , viii .
