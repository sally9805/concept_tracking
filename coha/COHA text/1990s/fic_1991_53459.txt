WHEN I LOOK IN THE MIRROR for the scar , I ca n't see it . But I run my finger above my upper lip and I feel a slight ridge . So much lost to sight remains for the touch . That morning , the first thing I said was , " I wo n't go to Willie 's . " <p> " Now hush . She 'll hear you . Think of someone other than yourself . " Years from then , when I heard " the walls have ears " in history class , no one had to explain it to me . In my childhood , someone always was almost in earshot , about to hear the truth , which , of course , they must be protected from . My mother tips the Shalimar bottle and dabs the ground glass stopper behind her ears and on her wrist pulses . Willie comes in to tell her Mrs. Parrott does n't like to be late and she better hurry . Willie looks down at me . <p> " What ails you ? You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judy Sykes is the teacher 's pet . " <p> " That 's not true . " My mother brushes her hair back and opens her Fire and Ice lipstick . It 's shaped like one of the Monopoly " men , " like the top of a circus tent . " Miss Goff told me you were adorable . She said you were in A group . Put that lip in ; I could ride to town on it . " <p> Soon I would be in the room with all the letters of the alphabet cut out of colored construction paper and tacked around the blackboard . There I can watch the clock 's long minute hand click and jump from one line to the next , see time pass between the numbers . At recess I 'd play Red Light . " I like school , " I say softly . <p> " There , I knowed you did all along . " Willie pulls up my socks and ties my sash for the third time . Mother , still in a peach satin and lace slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quickly dresses , <p> On mornings when Mother got up before I went to school , I 'd know what was up . She 'd stand at the mirror , dip on square topaz earrings , pat two triangles of rouge on her cheekbones , then rub them in with fast little upward motions . I begged to go to Macon , too , thought of Morrison 's cafeteria next to Davison 's where we shopped , green plastic trays sliding along shiny tracks . Rows of red Jello cut in cubes , cream pies with banana slices , an enormous roast beef , and stainless steel boxes of steaming limp vegetables . I could take two desserts without her noticing until the end of the line when it was too late . She went three or four times a year on major shopping expeditions . My father , who later would find bills hidden among the tablecloths in the sideboard , was never told until after the fact . He 'd come home and hear her car still ticking from the fast ninety-mile drive . He put his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashed on the windshield . <p> Last time in Davison 's , I threw a tantrum for a little white dog that played a song when you wound him up . I 'd never seen anything like that and had to have it . I hit the floor , kicked , and rolled . My mother grabbed my hand and , squeezing until the birthstone ring cut through my fingers , pulled me along the floor . Sitting on the floor of her bedroom , I almost hear my shouts , " I want it ! I want it ! " and I smile a little . My mother slips on her alligator pumps . What will she bring ? A full skirt with wide rick-rack to twirl in , patent leather shoes with a button on the side strap , a white angora sweater ? I think of Willie 's , chickens scratching under the porch , and how dark it is beyond the screen door with its balls of cotton stuck on with bobby pins to catch the flies . Even from there the smell of boiling turnip greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play on the swings , but I 'm supposed to go straight home . I can feel how cold the blue bars of the jungle gym would be if I stopped to climb . The janitor , Mr. Fountain , rakes leaves into a ring of small piles . He has a dozen children , a wife with wonky eyes , and they live in one room . He leans on his rake , watching the sycamore leaves catch , smolder . The air fills with eye-stinging smoke . I wave my painting of my own handprint , with many ruby and emerald rings drawn on the fingers . Judy Sykes skips across the playground toward her mother 's car . Her dress is too short , and I see her ugly underwear . Her mother has something wrong and wo n't go anywhere , except to drive Judy . My mother picks me up sometimes , but she is busy . The Magnolia Garden Club has to replant the parks that went to weeds during the war . They have luncheons to plan the flowers . They play bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( named for the uniforms of both sides in the real war ) , passing the Northern marker near the street and the Confederate one close to the creek . Once I saw a Negro man in the sourgrass , peeing against the Confederate stone . <p> From a block away , Willie recognizes the triangle of my red skirt running under the pine trees and begins to wave . She 's ready to go . She has changed from her black uniform into a skirt and a sweater set that used to be Mother 's . " We 're going by a viewing on the way . Now if you 're good  --  and you know what good means  --  we 'll get you a drink afterwards . " <p> " What viewing ? " <p> " There 's nothing for you to pay no mind to . My Auntie "  --  she pronounced it ontee  --  " passed away and she 's up at George Rigg 's . I want to pay respects . " <p> " Do what ? " <p> " It just means good-bye . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister . You knowed Auntie , she worked for the Earlys . " We turned left down Sherman . Willie walked fast toward colored town . <p> " Was Sherman a Southern or Northern , Willie ? " The town of Fitzgerald was founded as a refuge for soldiers from both sides , and the streets were named either for generals , battleships , or southern trees and rivers . The town plan , a solid grid one mile square , guarantees you never can get lost here . <p> " I do n't know , honey . That was too long ago , but we 're almost there . I want you real quiet . It 's disrespectful to the dead to make noise . " She opens a door under a flaking sign that says " Nearer My God To Thee . " An oily black man in a suit with white lines on the pants steps up to us . The lights are dim and the smell of roses feels so heavy it 's as if we 've stepped inside a flower . Pink shades on hanging lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a minute I see racks and wreathes of flowers . " You stay right here till I get back , you hear ? " <p> I hunch down on the red rug between the feet of a coat rack . I understand dead . People die all the time . I 'd just seen a hump of clay at the cemetery with a pot of purple plastic tulips . Mother said how cheap that was of Mrs. Parker , him not dead two months . In the flower room , I see Willie talking to two old women . All around them are roses , carnations , bows sprinkled with sequins , and big gold flowers like my sisters wear to football games at college . Waves of scent roll out of the room every time the front door opens . The old women come out . Leaning on each other they almost step on my outstretched legs . The shriveled woman has a handkerchief pressed to her nose , and her cheeks are streaked with tears . As they leave they sign in a book on a stand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks you up when you get up to heaven . I stand up and walk to the doorway . The man in the suit slowly walks over to me with his hands behind his back . He leans over . ! do n't like his stuck-together mustache . It curls down around big pink lips that look like a plucked dove . He smiles a big gold smile at me . I see a long box up on a table draped with a shiny pink skirt . " I expect you better wait over here . You just wait pretty . " The fat man goes to the door to greet someone , and I slip around the corner quietly into the flower room . Willie 's kneeling , her face in her hands . Everything 's swagged like a puppet show . There 's another smell now , the same as the back of my mother 's closet where the old shoes get mildew on the insides and the summer dresses crush together with their stale perfume . I look in the box . <p> Auntie Gray . But her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the color of rust , and she has on her little gold glasses even though her eyes are closed . Is she really dead ? In the tiny space between her lips she might , secretly , still be breathing . Her hands are folded over her stomach like Daddy Jack 's when he naps . Suddenly I have to go to the bathroom . I cross my legs to hold it . I reach out and put my hand on Auntie 's . She 's hard as a candle . I try to lift up the hand , but it 's frozen like the frog I found in a bucket . Auntie sometimes stopped by to see Willie . She 'd pour her coffee into the saucer , then pour it back into the cup . Then , she was just one of the maids who walked home down Lemon every afternoon . Now she looks so important with purple crepe dress and lace collar . She had a soft cackle of a laugh ; now her fingernails are the greenish color of old bruises , and her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a doll of herself . Someone behind me breathes fast and I turn , expecting the owner . It is a man with a hat in his hands . He looks at Auntie , not me . His lips begin working , but I hear no sound . His eyes , popped out and cloudy like a dead rockfish 's eyes . Swallowing down the sound my throat suddenly wants to make , I run back to the other room , hunch against the coats again . <p> Willie comes out walking fast . She reaches over me for her sweater . " You were good ; you can be good when you try . Let 's go get you that drink . " I jump out into the hard winter light of colored town . Everything looks the same : the mean little stores and men in overalls leaning along the walls , pale sun that looks as if it shines through white tissue paper . I want to ask Willie something . What ? And Willie has her shoulders hunched up , her big lips stuck out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sidewalk , not caring if my panties show , and wipe the mud on my skirt . <p> In Lester 's , Willie unknots her handkerchief and takes out the change Mother gave her for me . I open the drink box and look down at the bottles standing in the dark , cold water . I fish out an orange Nehi from all the RC Colas . " Who 's that you got , Willie , one of Cap'n Jack 's granbabies ? " Lester had a wad of something in his jaw . " Just the spit of her old man , ai n't she ? " <p> " She 's like her Mama some , too . " <p> " Yessir , I guess nobody will have to show the bobcat 's chil ' how to spring , " he laughs . " I 'll bring the bottle back tomorrow . " Willie snaps her purse shut , cutting off further talk . <p> I follow Willie through her dark living room into the kitchen . From her paper sack she takes out a new coloring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me at the white porcelain table , then turns on the iron . The kitchen had two other tables instead of counters , and Willie covered them in red oilcloth and stapled it underneath the tops . Over the drain-board hung a picture of Jesus with his eyes rolled back and three iron pots swinging from nails . I like the things Willie has  --  the straight chairs with pony skin bottoms and the cigar box of forks stamped with U.S. Navy and the Henry Grady Hotel , which I recognize because we always stay there when we go shopping in Atlanta . Her plates are each a different bright color . <p> While the iron heats , Willie sits down . " What are you going to color me ? You color me a pretty picture and I 'll hang it there by the door so 's I see it every time I go out . " <p> I study the pages and select a colt looking down at a daisy in a meadow . I begin to zigzag two shades of green crayon over the grass . Willie takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holds it up to the window . " I 've got to get this dress ready to go to the funeral . " She dips a corner of a rag into the pot on the stove and rubs at the sleeve . <p> " What are you doing ? " <p> " I clean off spots with coffee . You ca n't wash this kinda material . " When she irons , the smell of scorched sweat rises in a steam around the iron . I remember the flowery mildew smell around Auntie . <p> " Where is Auntie ? " I make dark blue loops in the sky . <p> " Why you know , she 's laying out at Rigg 's . " <p> I put my face down on the cool porcelain . I keep coloring slowly . " I saw her , too . " <p> " What ? Yo ' mama ai n't going to like that one bit . " <p> " I wo n't tell her . I wanted to see . What happened to her ? " <p> Willie pushed back my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fit . She 's just gone , that 's all . " <p> " Did she go to heaven ? " <p> " Yes , they says so . " I wait for her to say more , but she goes back to the iron and carefully presses the pique collar . What 's a seizure , I wonder ; something like an enormous hand shaking you ? I imagine Auntie walking down Lemon and an enormous hand coming out of the pecan trees and shaking her to death . Could a seizure happen anytime ? I run my tongue around my mouth , counting my teeth to myself . <p> Outside the window I see the wooden shed over the well . I remember Mother reading me a story out of the Atlanta Journal about a little girl who fell down an old well in a vacant lot . Running in any field the ground could collapse , I could fall , fall , fall , splash into black water , and no one would hear me scream . If I tried to climb up the sides , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back down the slimy stones . I remember Willie has a well , too . " Ca n't we get a drink from the well ? I 'm thirsty again . " <p> Willie slides the cover off and I lean over and see my face , small as a nickel way down in the water . The bucket goes down on a rope , tips and slips under water , then Willie cranks it up , dips in a gourd , and pours a drink into a jelly glass . I hold up the glass and see little specks swimming . Just as I am about to ask Willie why it does n't taste like the water at home , a rooster comes out of a row of dry corn stubble . He flexes his wings and rises up on his daws . Every instinct I have turns me toward Willie , but she is taking sheets off the line , just out of reach . The rooster gives a low , broken cackle . I raise my arms with a little cry just as he squawks and flies at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sheets . In one motion she kicks the rooster hard and jerks me away . The rooster , suddenly indifferent , ruffles his feathers and struts around the house . Willie slings a clod after him . <p> A thin line of red drops darkens my red skirt , as in summer when I got nosebleeds that would n't stop until Willie held cold scissors against my back . Willie lifts me on the kitchen table and swabs my face with water . I stare into her brown face as she paints the cut with a cold wand of iodine . She looks as though it hurts her , too . She frowns and makes little clicking noises . " Lord , Lord . " I kick at the table legs as the medicine burns into my cheek . Sudden stings of pain force my tears . I burrow against Willie 's arm . " You cry all you want to . " Willie holds me on her lap , rocking me back and forth . The rooster seems to fly at me over and over . The hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I never can get away from the feeling of his feathers all over my body , and I am right . I curl as small as I can , crying until I stop , and my chest feels tight with no more tears . Something dense and heavy , like a stone growing inside , keeps me still . <p> At six o'clock , the blare of the Oldsmobile horn . My hair stuck to my forehead . As I open my eyes I see Willie 's black dress still draped over the ironing board . Willie buttons my sweater and hands me the crayons and coloring book in a paper sack . " You can finish tomorrow . Now run on , yo ' mama 's waiting . " <p> I climb in the backseat . My mother looks at me through the mirror , then turns around , her smile disappearing as she sees my face . I watch her mouth move into an O. " What on earth happened to you ? You look awful . " <p> " A rooster pecked me and scratched me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was not . You always ... " I run my finger over the rough welt that is now my face . <p> " Always what ? " <p> I do n't answer . ! do n't know what I even started to say . <p> " Well , look in the pink bag on the floor and you 'll feel better . " I find the bag among the other boxes and bags . Before I see it , I feel the white musical puppy with blue velvet under his ears . I wind him and put him to my ear . He smells new and I hear the little mechanical purr under the sound of the music . <p> " Mama , did you know Auntie died ? " " Urn hum . That was sad , was n't it ? " " I was scared of that rooster . " <p> " Awful . Was n't Willie looking after you ? " <p> " Yes , but she could n't help it . He was too fast . He shook me in his beak . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I see my mother 's eyes in the rearview mirror . She is looking straight ahead at Roanoke Drive . Even in the dusky light they are blankly clear , almost like the blind beggar I saw on the sidewalk the last time I went shopping in Macon . He sold a cup of yellow pencils , his blue eyes tipped up toward heaven . But my mother looks soft , too , especially with the rustycolored foxes around her neck . I overwind the new dog , and he plays his song double-time all the way home . <p> <p> By FRANCES MAYES <p>
