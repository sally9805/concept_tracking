<p> Our busy existences are becoming increasingly so , as we live in a world of the moment . . . faster computers , cars , conversations , lives . <p> There you are , grinding through yet another hellacious day at your own personal salt mine , making one pile of paper smaller as another grows larger , when a colleague strolls up to you , to utter a seemingly harmless phrase . <p> " So , whatcha doing tomorrow for Valentine 's Day ? " <p> At which point your self-possessed , harried little world halts in a guttural , chagrined , " d-oh ! " You forgot the only holiday that celebrates the one thing we all crave  --  luuuuvvvve . <p> Songs have celebrated it , such as Led Zeppelin 's " Whole Lotta Love , " with the lyric Waaay down inside/Woman/You need/Loooovvvve ! <p> Books are written about it , telling you how to get more of it , how to keep what you have , how to find what you lost  --  and you forgot . <p> Go ahead , admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hope . Contained below is a cornucopia of sure-fire ideas for the last-minute , forgetful or procrastinating romantic that will make you seem like Cupid himself , every fiber of your being imbued with advance-planned , romantic aplomb . <p> Just hide this section from your beloved and plot away . <p> But first a bit of history , which will make you seem even more dialed in . <p> St. Valentine 's Feast occurs on Feb. 14 , celebrating one of two people , who might in fact be the same person : Valentine of Rome was martyred in 269 A.D. , slain by Claudius II ( the Goth ) . The other Valentine was a bishop in Terni , Italy . <p> The death of one or both of these fellows led to Saint Valentine , who became the patron saint of lovers . <p> However , the exchange of love notes on Feb. 14 dates to the 16th century , possibly based on the theory that birds began to mate on this day . You should also note that this stuff means about as much as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious homages on Feb. 14 have long been obliterated by the frantic passing of greeting cards , roses and chocolate . . . . <p> Those gifts are strictly for pedestrian holiday forgetters , and only one of them is among the helpful hints below . As you make some of the love stops on this grand tour , you can seem wildly spontaneous or rigidly pre-planned , depending upon which of the aforementioned attributes you have been accused of lacking . <p> Go ice skating . Almost every community has an ice rink.Ice skates are also one of the cheapest things to be found at resale shops or sporting goods stores , in case you ca n't rent a pair . <p> Ice skating is unbelievably romantic , for reasons fathomable to a select few . But think of the Meet Cute episodes in movies that revolve around ice skating , or the dating situations that escalate on metal blades as a couple bonds because they 're both terrible . This can work for you , too . Skate on State is also available , but it will probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <p> Also , the annual wedding extravaganza is being held at Skate on State , where bladed couples tie the knot on ice . Of course , given the state of the weather , they might have to wed on in-line skates , but there are few things as romantic as seeing someone else jump the broom . ( Helpful hint : Try to get hockey skates , which tend to have more support , like in-line skates , eliminating wobbly ankles . ) <p> This sounds hokey , but go to a romantic movie . Sure it 's obvious ; it 's so completely obvious that you might actually have the theater to yourself ( well , you wo n't after this ) . Some call ' em chick movies , others call ' em a gold mine , but a romantic film is a surefire way to earn style points for the forgetful lover . Some suggestions are " Great Expectations , " " Afterglow " or " Titanic . " Sure , that blockbuster ends with disaster , but it 's also chock-full o ' romance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a chick movie . ) <p> Read aloud to your loved one . Literary history is crammed with the delectable , sometimes scatalogically intact , other times unspeakably beautiful musings from authors of various stripes . There are Henry Miller , Anais Nin , Jackie Collins ( for the trailer dwellers ) , Shakespeare ( romantic , but not particularly heated ) and the undisputed king of bawdy talk , the Marquis de Sade . Sure he writes about floggings and torture , but there are also plenty of normal , fanciful episodes of more conventional erotic bonding . <p> Best of all , you can get his books at the library , which earns you bonus points for the look you 'll earn from the librarian as you check them out . Try for Juliette , or Philosophy in the Bedroom . When you get De Sade 's social philosophizing , you can just skip it . ( Helpful hint for guys : Tom Clancy does n't cut it , no matter how cool wars and stuff are . ) <p> Plan a romantic dinner , but go shopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't go to the usual market . Indeed , supermarkets are cool stores , and will certainly suffice for any culinary excursions , but you want romance , you forgetful boob . Try a Treasure Island , or even a Whole Foods , places that smell of herbs and have exotic concoctions for your palate . Be sure to stop by the chocolate aisle for my preferred brand , Valhrona . ( Helpful hint : Hershey 's will do here , just so long as you have some chocolate . You 're darn right it 's an aphrodisiac . ) <p> An elegant , romantic meal might include items like grapes , shrimp or a succulent filet mignon accompanied by a robust bottle of red wine . The astute noticed the emphasis on finger foods , since there 's nothing quite like feeding the object of your affection . <p> A private ballroom dancing session . This is a post-dinner activity . Get dressed in your best duds , light some candles , push the furniture aside and put on some great music . Recommendations are Piazzola tangos or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra . <p> If you do n't know how to waltz , it does n't matter , because you 're in your own living room . Much of the stigma associated with not being able to dance is removed when no one else can see you . An option is basic slow dancing , to whatever languid groove you can lay your hands on . ( Helpful hint : Anita Baker . ) <p> Buy naughty bits . The imagination is a powerful thing , and there 's nothing like the sight of your loved one in a delectably unmentionable little garment to inflame the senses . Your guy wears dowdy boxers all year ? Break out the French cut , slim-line action , or the tried-and-true red silk . <p> Even cooler is to shop together , letting the excursion turn into an anticipation-building modeling session . ( Helpful hint : Rub your cheek with the garment before final purchase , for a tactile check . It matters . ) <p> Go for a walk . Yeah , that 's right , get outside and go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be snow for those cutesy snowball fights . The weather 's bad ? So what . Snuggle closer . Many a romantic pact has been solidified under a small umbrella . <p> There 's something about the outside air that wakes up the senses and stimulates fond feelings . Go for a run together , ride bikes , do something , just get outside . ( Helpful hint to serious athletes : Make it something easy , and do n't hammer your beloved . Sure , you can speed skate , but . . . ) <p> Schedule a rendezvous . Every couple has a meaningful location in their lives together . Even if it 's some joint that might be infested with people frantically making eyes at each other , it 's still romantic to call someone to say , " Meet me at the 95th ( atop the John Hancock Center ) . " Just because it 's obvious does n't mean it 's not romantic . ( Helpful hint : Be prompt . Nothing quashes a great night like a little tiff because somebody was late . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be a good way to get into a romantic restaurant . Just because everything here is filled does n't mean some little hideaway in , say , Milwaukee is n't begging for amorous diners . Consult an Amtrak schedule , get down to the station and get away . You do n't even have to get off the train at the destination if you do n't want to , provided the train is turning right around . But rail trips ( especially those involving sleeper cars ) are filled with romance that the rapidity of airplanes just ca n't contend with . ( Helpful hint : In a pinch , the CTA will do . Who can forget the L scene between Tom Cruise and Rebecca DeMornay in " Risky Business " ? ) <p> Give ' em a pedicure . Why , because anybody can give a manicure , you knucklehead ! There 's something about feet , whether it 's their sensitivity or just the fact that you love someone enough to deal with their gnarly toes that makes interaction with those peds something special . <p> Begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a gentle drying with a soft towel . Nail polish is , obviously , an option for the advanced , or those who do n't mind waiting for the stuff to dry . But clipping , filing and/or buffing is decidedly not . ( Helpful hint to guys : This one 's for you , obviously . Men do n't get pedicures , and there 's a reason . ) <p> So , during the chronicling of all these romantic exploits , we appear to have neglected something obvious . . . what if you do n't have a date ? <p> Well , if you 've forgotten that much , you might be beyond all hope , but there 's life on Valentine 's Day for you people , as well . <p> Buy one . No , not like that , silly . But tonight , beginning at 6 o'clock , the Starlight Foundation is conducting its seventh annual Dream Date Auction at the Park West . <p> What are being touted as some of Chicago 's hottest bachelors and bachelorettes are going to the highest bidder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starlight Foundation makes wishes come true for ill children . Tickets are $ 30 in advance and $ 35 at the door . Call Starlight at ( 312 ) 251-7827 . <p> Find one on the telephone . Almost every newspaper has a personals section these days , with telephone access . When you call an advertiser , you get a voice introduction , which allows you to hear the dulcet tones of your potential intended . You can leave a message , then sit by the telephone . And yes , you 'd better believe that every person not already linked up will be checking their voice mailbox every five minutes on Feb. 13 and 14 , waiting for the right voice . <p> ( Helpful hint . These work . Your author met his wife of more than six happy years through a personals ad . ) <p> Now that you 've got ' em , buy a bottle of wine and drink it . Davis &; Company Wine Auctioneers is holding its first major sale of the year on Saturday at the University Club , 76 E. Monroe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fine and rare vintages are going on the block from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m . <p> Purchase a bottle that needs to age to commemorate the occasion , or buy one ready to drink and savor it together . Bidding is sure to be hot for the Chateau Calon-Segur , a Bordeaux that carries a heart-shaped graphic on the label . ( Helpful hint : Wine snobs are funny sometimes , especially at the tasting , which is being held from 10-11 a.m . Laughter is a surefire couples bonding activity . ) For more information , call ( 312 ) 587-9500 . <p> Take a picture . Sure , if you want they can be those kinds of pictures , but people who want to keep their clothes on can have fun , too . You can find a last-minute photographer to chronicle you and your partner in a loving embrace in the telephone book . There are also those cozy photo booths , where a dollar or two gets you a little strip of black and white photos of you and yours . <p> There 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but oh , so cool . Hordes of hotels have getaway packages for Valentine 's Day , often including lodging and other perks such as champagne and chocolate . To be sure , this might require a bit of calling around to find one with space , but it serves you right for letting this go until the day before the holiday . <p> And think lap of luxury , since there is nothing quite as sumptuous as a top-flight hotel . The Ambassador East , Whitehall and Ritz-Carlton are but a few of the upscale sleeperies that are having special offers for the weekend . <p> Be a grump . Sure , you 're being bombarded with appeals to your romantic side , friends are embarking on pre-planned nights of fantasy or dashing about , clutching this section , making plans . You , however , can stand resolute , saying , " My partner and I do n't go for that hype . Every day is Valentine 's Day for us . " You 'll feel superior , but you 'd better clear this attitude with your significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singles , can resolve to have a cool night all by your lonesome . It might consist of a video you 've always wanted to see , a decadent dinner , or an in-home massage . Just make yourself happy , and do n't go feeling guilty because you are n't hooked up . <p> So that 's it , folks . Hope there 's something on this list to make you all tingly inside , whether you 're perusing it with a loved one or by yourself , trying not to look like you spaced it . Just have fun .
