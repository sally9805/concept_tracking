If you think cliched expressions are for the birds , you may just have hit the nail on the head . <p> Cliches , for the uninitiated , are those trite phrases we 're all too familiar with . Some examples include " once in a blue moon , " " armed to the teeth , " " a sight for sore eyes , " and " the handwriting on the wall . " <p> How do you react when you encounter them ? Do you laugh up your sleeve ? Blow hot and cold ? Do you see red ? Flip your lid ? <p> What follows is an acid test for recognizing cliches . And if you 're cooking with gas , you 'll come through with flying colors . Incidentally , this test is for the rank and file , as well as those who are smart as a whip . <p> Ready ? Put your nose to the grindstone and give it your best shot , but if you fall by the wayside , you may have to eat humble pie . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our son , Hercules , a high school senior , walked in . Here does well with dumbbells , but he does even better with dumb belles . <p> Anyway , in a huff and a puff , he announced that his late-model Grand Prix had folded like an accordion in a fender bender , so I promptly hit the ceiling and almost blew my top . After a while , you could have heard a pin drop ! <p> " How did it happen ? " I finally asked , trying to remain as cool as a cucumber . <p> " It was raining cats and dogs ; the brakes got wet and did n't hold . Then this living doll slammed into my rear like a ton of bricks . " <p> " What was her name ? " <p> " Claudia ! Honest to goodness , Dad , she 's pretty as a picture and she 's really something else .

He 's a yo-yo expert , second to none . " <p> Gabrielle , her mother , became as mad as a wet hen , while I just stood there , all ears . " A career and love do n't mix , " admonished Gabrielle . " If you try to burn the candle at both ends , you 'll fall flat on your face . " <p> " Oh , for crying out loud ! " Ophelia replied . " Stop beating around the bush ! " <p> " OK ! Six months ago , you got into hot water with Angelo , the house-to-house pizza salesman , who proved rotten to the core . And how about Cecil , the Philadelphia lawyer , who got sick to his stomach whenever anyone mentioned marriage ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the belt . " <p> " Is that so ? But you must agree they were all birds of a feather . " <p> " Anyway , Cornelius is out of this world , and we intend to tie the knot next month . " <p> " Over my dead body ! " yelled her mother . " It 's all puppy love , and you 're still chasing rainbows . But this time , I 'm putting my foot down ! " <p> At this point , they both beat a hasty retreat , and I heaved a sigh of relief . <p> Later , when I saw Gabrielle , I said , " Ophelia 's living in a fool 's paradise , but maybe there 's more to this than meets the eye . Anyway , just try to keep your cool and maintain a stiffupper lip . " <p> But Gabrielle was still fit to be tied . " Go tell it to the marines , " she snapped .

Poor Cornelius fell out of the limelight and went back to pulling strings . <p> <p> Now , in using cliches , Gabrielle and I are in a class by ourselves , always having them at the tips of our tongues and ready to use at the drop of a hat . <p> I have been a sun lover since I was in diapers . Gabrielle , on the other hand , thinks all sun worshippers are sick in the head . One day , I was sunbathing on the hood of our old Buick in the parking lot of Goosefeather 's Supermarket Barn , waiting for Gabrielle to finish shopping . When she did come back , she eyed me up and down . <p> " You idiot ! " she screamed . " You 're burned to a crisp ! " <p> " You mean I 'm as red as a lobster ? " I joked . <p> " I 'm at the end of my rope with your shenanigans , " she yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd rather see you whim as a sheet than red as a beet ! " <p> When I saw her eyes blazing , it suddenly dawned on me that I had to handle her with kid gloves , because I was treading on thin ice . So I kissed her passionately and , naturally , she ate it up . <p> Later , I smelled the delicious aroma of my favorite dinner , eggplant parmigiana , so I knew that all was quiet on the Potomac once again . <p> <p> One day my brother , Sabu , a health nut and always in the pink , shocked me . " Do you have any aspirin ? " he asked . " Believe it or not , I 'm sick as a dog . " <p> " You look fit as a fiddle to me , " I replied . " Besides , I thought you did n't believe in medicine .

If you got between 80 and 90 , you obviously had both feet on the ground , and you almost hit the nail on the head . <p> What ? You say you got them all ?
