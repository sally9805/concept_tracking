<p> CRACOW , Poland - At a railway siding , a Nazi commandant and his servile lieutenants feasted on fruit and drank punch from a crystal bowl while hundreds of terrified Jews - penned in stifling cattle cars - beseeched their captors for water . <p> Sixty miles from Auschwitz , near the site where this horror unfolded a half century ago , Steven Spielberg was directing this scene from Schindler 's List . Based on the acclaimed 1982 book by Thomas Keneally , the film tells the story of a vain German businessman , Oskar Schindler , who saved the lives of his 1,300 Jewish factory workers at the height of the Holocaust . <p> For Spielberg , Schindler 's List represents the culmination of more than a decade of preparation , a test of the range of his talent and a re-immersion in his Jewish faith . The long incubation period proved to be fortuitous . Amid renewed debate over the Holocaust , some of it stirred by the opening this spring of the Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington , D.C. , the movie seems well-timed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shadow of the Nazi death camps , Spielberg was emphasizing a point to his star , Liam Neeson . For his portrayal of Schindler , Neeson was clad in a pale summer suit and Panama hat as he displayed pity for the Jews en route to Auschwitz . <p> But Spielberg , who has just completed filming the $ 23 million movie , which will be released in December , wanted to emphasize that the man depicted in popular history as a saint was not untainted . Schindler , an entrepreneur with an eye as keen for women as for the bottom line , may have saved Jews , but he also befriended Nazis . <p> The director encouraged Neeson to joke with the murderers and thump their table in an outburst of conviviality . When the actors reached the proper pitch of merriment , Spielberg grinned and shouted from behind his monitor , " " Print ! I love it ! " <p> Later , he said , " " I did n't want this to be a movie about St. Schindler . That 's too easy . Schindler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did n't care who the ruse was on ; it could be a Jew or the Germans . " <p> Schindler 's List seems a departure for a filmmaker best-known for high-grossing diversions like Jaws ( 1975 ) and E.T. , the Extra-Terrestrial ( 1982 ) . He is also the man whose latest excursion into fantasy , Jurassic Park , based on Michael Crichton 's best seller about dinosaurs on the loose , is regarded as a likely summer blockbuster . <p> Spielberg has ventured into serious literary territory before : in 1985 with The Color Purple , based on Alice Walker 's best seller about a black woman 's tumultuous life , and two years later with Empire of the Sun , based on J.G. Ballard 's autobiographical novel of a boy 's wartime experiences in China . <p> But neither effort was rewarded with the popularity or praise that greeted Spielberg movies like Close Encounters of the Third Kind in 1977 or Raiders of the Lost Ark in 1981 , and some critics questioned his ability to deal successfully with complex material . <p> " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every morning I have to think of Schindler and the Jews , " Spielberg said , relaxing between takes in his baggy jeans , work shirt and blue baseball cap . " " In the other movies , I always have the audience in my mind . It 's always , " How is the audience going to like the villain ? Is there enough comedy ? ' " <p> But at work on a film that addresses the most serious of subjects , he said , " " I feel I 'm more a journalist behind a camera . <p> I feel more like a reporter on this job . " <p> Spielberg grew up in an observant Jewish household in which his mother referred to Germans as " " those murderers . " <p> " " I 'm third-generation , " he said . " " My parents and grandparents talked about the Holocaust . They were Americans ; it was easy to talk about it . I was religious until I was 14 , when my grandparents died . But I was ashamed of being Jewish , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Christmas , ours was the only dark house - everyone else 's was lit up . " <p> In making Schindler 's List , based on a screenplay by Steve Zaillian , who wrote the scripts for Awakenings and Jack the Bear , Spielberg went beyond the book that inspired it . He piled his own research onto Keneally 's , interviewed survivors and invited some of them onto his set . <p> The Schindler-Juden , as they are known , are in their 70s and 80s and scattered from Israel to Long Island . Schindler first hired Jews for his enamelware works in Cracow and then , by cajoling and humoring the Nazis , managed to relocate his contingent of " " skilled workers " - including rabbis , children , women , a girl dying of cancer - to a munitions factory in Czechoslovakia . There they were safe from the death camps . <p> The book recreates violent shootings in the Cracow ghetto , brutalities in the Plaszow labor camp outside the city , and the plight of starving women , weighing as little as 70 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was refused entry into the United States after the war because his factory was classified as a forced-labor camp , died in Germany in 1974 . <p> Over lunch on location , Spielberg talked about his perception of Schindler with some visitors : Tom Pollock , the chairman of the MCA Motion Picture Group ; and Sidney Sheinberg , the president of MCA . It was Sheinberg who first brought the Schindler story to Spielberg 's attention and whose company will distribute the movie . <p> Schindler 's List has been gestating in Spielberg 's imagination for more than 10 years . Sheinberg had sent an early review of the book to Spielberg not only because the subject was so compelling but also because he believed it suited the director . <p> " " I 've always felt Steven 's capabilities were so much broader than the world realizes , " Sheinberg said . " " I hope he has finally emerged from the notion that he can only do two-dimensional movies . " <p> But there were delays . The wealth of material - so many passionate , often grisly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spielberg had doubts about his emotional readiness to deal with the Holocaust . These concerns were deepened , he said , by his unwillingness until now to make a movie that did not promise immense commercial success . <p> He also had to decide whether to use major stars or less-well-known actors . He chose the latter . There are no American actors . Besides the Irish-born Neeson , Ben Kingsley of England may be the best-known name , and many parts are played by Israelis . <p> Spielberg chose as one of his producers a Croatian , Branko Lustig , who was interned at Auschwitz as a child and has spent most of his life in Europe . Lustig bears a tattoo from Auschwitz - No.83317 - on the lower part of his left arm . The correct position of the tattoos for the hundreds of extras was one of many details that Lustig relayed to the set and costume designers from personal experience . <p> About his decision to use little color , the director said , " " All the photos of the Holocaust are in black-and-white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the graphic scenes of Jews being herded into trains and shot in the labor camps were filmed with hand-held cameras .
