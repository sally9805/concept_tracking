Section : THE FORBES NONPROFIT 500 Introducing the Forbes Nonprofit 5001 A group that turns out to be not so nonprofit after all . <p> WITH CONGRESS scraping the bottom of the barrel for new revenue sources , one of the most sacred of all cows  --  the nonprofit sector  --  may be called upon next to help meet the growing cost of government . <p> Untaxed and effectively unregulated , the nonprofits command well-nigh universal reverence , respect and unprecedented power in the economy . <p> And that power is growing . The number of nonprofit institutions rose almost 15% during the decade ending in 1987 , to 1.3 million , while the number of charitable nonprofits rose nearly 40% . This highly fragmented sector  --  which includes hospitals , universities , credit unions , cooperatives and charitable institutions  --  already accounts for well over $750 billion in annual revenues , or about 15% of the gross national product . <p> What organizations compose this potent , if little scrutinized , part of the economy ? What do they do ? Who runs them ? With this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Organizations . Beyond showing the breadth and depth of the sector , the lists show that the nonprofits are good at making money . With very few exceptions , revenues handily exceed expenses . Even among those enterprises that give most of their services away , in fact , there is usually plenty of retained excess . Farmland Industries , for instance , an agricultural cooperative , netted $99 million last year , the Mayo Foundation $167 million , and the American Red Cross $35 million . <p> The nonprofits ' biggest advantage is the exemption of their profits from federal and other levels of taxation . But there are other advantages . For example , many nonprofits are able to use the mails at two-thirds of what it costs their for-profit counterparts . <p> The nonprofit designation is itself a powerful marketing tool . These institutions come armed with what the for-profit sector calls the halo effect : Because of the purity and nobility of their goals , most people expect them to provide superior quality and services . <p> Combine these commercial advantages with the nonprofits ' recent rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private for-profit businesses on terms that are not only unfair but also probably economically destructive . <p> The electric utilities used to complain about competition from the electric cooperatives . The banks and the for-profit hospitals still gripe about nonprofit credit unions and hospitals . But these days the loudest complaints are coming from small businesses . They have a sympathetic ear : Since the early Eighties the Small Business Administration under the instigation of Frank Swain , its former chief counsel for advocacy , has been pressuring Congress to do something about nonprofit competition . <p> " Allowing nonprofits to compete on the backs of for-profit businesses is not where our economy is best served , " argues John Satagaj , president of the Small Business Legislative Council in Washington , D.C. " It 's just not the most efficient use of the system . " <p> Why should Nation 's Business , a magazine published by the nonprofit U.S. Chamber of Commerce , be tax-exempt when FORBES , Fortune and Business Week are n't ? Why are Ocean Spray Cranberries and Land O'Lakes tax-exempt , when competitors Kraft and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; neighboring Dominion Resources is not . <p> In practice if not in theory , Congress has tended to view the tax exemption as a sort of for-profit incubator . It uses the exemption to encourage the development of services that the for-profit economy is incapable of producing . The tendency is then to withdraw the exemption once the nonprofit becomes indistinguishable from for-profit institutions . <p> Thus Congress ended the tax exemption on mutual life insurance companies in 1942 , on savings and loans and mutual savings banks in 1951 . It began taxing unrelated business income in 1950 , and in 1986 it moved on to tax the large mutual fire and casualty insurance companies and outfits like Blue Cross/Blue Shield . <p> And nowadays there 's talk about ending the exemption for credit unions , hospitals and electric cooperatives , as well as proposals to tax corporate contributions to employee benefit funds . Mail discounts alone cost the Postal Service over $450 million in revenue last year , revenue which Congress and taxpayers in general compensate it for . <p> The services the nonprofits provide are spread across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grave  --  from birth control and child care to health insurance and burial societies . Nonprofit labor unions set the terms under which many Americans work . Nonprofit credit unions finance their consumer and housing needs . Nonprofit cooperatives put food on their tables and light their lives . The permutations go on and on . <p> Without anyone 's paying much attention , many nonprofits have become household words : Ocean Spray and Sunkist , Underwriters Laboratories and Harvard University , National Geographic and Modern Maturity , the Mayo Clinic , the AFL-CIO and the National Football League . Each produces an economic good or service , in actual or potential competition with a for-profit producer . <p> Some nonprofits  --  like chambers of commerce , lodges and labor unions  --  are membership organizations and live off their membership fees . Others ' are quasi-business organizations producing services for a fee  --  electric power , agricultural marketing , health care . Still others , the conventional charitable nonprofits , depend on the donations of individual , foundation and government supporters . And then others fall somewhere in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as hospitals , colleges and universities are , on the fees they charge for their services . <p> As the nonprofits see it , they 've had little choice but to increase their fee-generating activities . The 1986 tax reform ended the charitable tax deduction for taxpayers who did not itemize , while the Reagan presidency began stanching government funding in nonprofit areas . In real terms , federal government support of nonprofit enterprises ( exclusive at Medicare and Medicaid ) fell 20% in the Eighties , and as it did the nonprofits began beating the bushes for other sources of income . Program service fees and other revenues went from 71% of the total in 1975 to 81% by 1982 , and since then have continued to mount . <p> The major thrust has been into new businesses , sometimes directly related , sometimes much less so . Colleges and universities , for example , have long sold books , souvenirs , T shirts and toiletries in their nonprofit ( but profitable ) college stores . But in recent years they have been peddling travel tours , audiovisual materials , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Association of Retired Persons , one of the largest membership organizations in the U.S. , even markets the halo . Under the AARP label , it offers its members such services as prescription drugs , homeowners ' insurance , mutual tunas , motoring and travel services and , until recently , a credit union membership . As it happens , most of these services are provided not by AARP but by outsiders who pay AARP tar access to its membership . <p> Nonprofit institutions are exempt from the Robinson-Patman Act , which requires suppliers to sell goods without discrimination at the same price to all customers . In other words , nonprofits can buy their supplies cheaper than their for-profit competitors . One result of this exemption is that colleges and universities frequently sell computer equipment and software at ruinously low prices . One computer dealer complains that one IBM computer retails in the education market at the same price the dealer has to pay wholesale , while the list price of an IBM monochrome monitor was actually $15 less than the wholesale price . <p> The University of Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related items in fiscal 1988 and 1989  --  and 10% of them went to nonuniversity customers . According to Connecting Point , a local for-profit Kansas computer center , its sales fell 91% in two years once the state universities went into the business . When Connecting Point cut its prices back to compete , the universities cut back even further . The competition was good for consumers but terrible for the U.S. Treasury . <p> The Young Men 's Christian Association has traditionally concentrated on providing residences for transients and gymnasiums for young people , especially the underprivileged . Recently , however , the Y has begun opening fancy health clubs , built with tax-free money , and offering services that the for-profit health clubs are hard put to meet . According to one calculation , the Y 's have a 25% to 33% cost advantage over the commercial health clubs . Once the Oakland , Calif . YMCA opened its health club in 1986 , it was only a matter of time before the 50-year-old private taxpaying health club down the street went out of business . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Y 's tax-exempt status in several states around the country , but in the end they have been unsuccessful almost everywhere . The Y 's argue that their job is to serve the needs of the community and not just the poor . The problem is n't simply that of for-profit and nonprofit competition ; it 's the competition between small business and any large competitor . <p> Nobody is so crass as to complain about Goodwill Industries ' selling below-cost goods made by disabled workers , or about the Girl Scouts ' selling cookies . But complaints from struggling for-profit business people are increasing as a host of other nonprofit competitors use their tax and other advantages to compete unfairly . Veterinarians fret about the competition from animal shelter clinics . Hearing-aid retailers are up in arms against hospitals and clinics . Even the Lake Tahoe Wedding Chapel Association complains that the $15 the local county clerks charge for a wedding ceremony undercuts the $100-and-up service offered by the chapels . <p> Since 1950 the nonprofits have been required to pay taxes on any unrelated business income they generate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Chamber of Commerce , for instance , does everything it can to avoid paying taxes on the advertising revenues generated by Nation 's Business . " If you get into the black , " explains the Chamber 's president , Richard L. Lesher , " you spread the overhead around a ways , so you do n't show too much profit  --  you know how that works . " <p> The macroresult is that , though 30,000 nonprofits file tax returns for their unrelated business activities , total tax receipts amount to not much over $130 million a year . <p> " The nonprofit gets to decide whether a business is related or unrelated , " gripes Kenton Pattie , a founder of the Business Coalition for Fair Competition , " and then pays the taxes on that business . They 've taken the position , if the ms does n't like it , come and convince us we 're wrong . " The Coalition has drawn up a bill that would prohibit government agencies , colleges and universities and other nonprofits from providing goods and services that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet got off the ground . <p> What , if anything , should be done ? The IRS is completing a study of 3,000 randomly selected returns to chart compliance with the Unrelated Business Income Tax . But however devastating nonprofit competition can be to individual for-profit companies , taxing the nonprofits ' unrelated business income is n't likely to generate any large tax revenues . According to the Independent Sector , a Washington , D.C.-based organization that monitors and encourages nonprofit enterprise , the charitable nonprofits ' revenue from sources other than contributions and program services amounts to a mere $14 billion , and only a fraction of that comes from unrelated business . <p> One could argue that it would make sense to end the tax exemption for any organization that gets the bulk of its income from fees . What difference would it make ? Very little . Grant Thornton 's nonprofit specialist , Christi Kasler , observes : " Many nonprofits could easily be run for-profit  --  or as state or municipal agencies . " <p> That would end the worst of the nonprofits ' unfair competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonanza . Assuming the nonprofits netted as much as 5% on the maybe $450 billion or so in essentially commercial revenues generated by their programs , and paid taxes at the standard 34% rate , the tax revenue gain would be at most $8 billion . That 's roughly half what the Treasury could recover if all deductibility of charitable contributions were ended . <p> What 's perhaps even more alarming about the spread of the nonprofit economy is the proposition that the nonprofits are not only morally superior to for-profit organizations but that they 're somehow also more efficient . Some of them  --  like the American Red Cross , the United Way , the Salvation Army and the Girl Scouts  --  do skillfully manage their objectives . But what sets the nonprofits apart from for-profit companies is that they have no legal owners . No stockholders . No proprietary interests to call their managers to account . And so , except for the agricultural co-ops , the surpluses  --  profits by any other name  --  that accumulate have no place to go but back into advancing the mission of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needs of the organization 's nonprofit mission , they tend to accrue to the benefit of the staff  --  if not in taxable money , then in such employee perks as travel allowances , low-interest loans and elaborate headquarters facilities  --  like the Ford Foundation 's crystal palace in New York or the American Red Cross ' Beaux Arts headquarters in Washington . <p> Alan Miller , chairman of Universal Health Services , the U.S. ' third-largest publicly traded hospital management company , sums up the economic dilemma presented by the nonprofits . " The problem , " says Miller , " is that the nonprofits do n't react in a rational way , the way a businessman would . They have n't the basic underlying concern that they can go out of business . They fool themselves . If you start off with that premise , spending money becomes a lot less difficult . " <p> It 's not easy running a business and being an angel all at the same time . From churches to credit unions : the dimensions of the nonprofit economy <p> The nonprofit economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost escapes detection . Nobody monitors the whole , and to capture it you have to tap a wide range of not wholly compatible resources . Some segments like the electric cooperatives and the pension and health and welfare funds are closely monitored by government agencies , others by industry consultants , or by Independent Sector . Of the rest , most , but not all , simply file tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service . As a result , the dimension of the nonprofit economy detailed below represent a mixture of solid statistics , informed estimates , and seat-of-the-pants guesstimates . What emerges , however , is a distinct third sector of the American economy and one unique among the capitalist societies of the Western World .
