When the courtiers came calling on Prince George down in Austin this winter , the Texas Governor liked to talk about how much he needed to learn to become a strong candidate for the White House . Bush would tell visitors about his crash course in foreign policy with the Republican Party 's best and brightest . And he would cite the Balkans as an example : " For instance , " he 'd say , " a year ago , I did n't know where Kosovo was . But I bet you did n't either . " <P> He knows now . And he also knows that sooner than anyone planned , the candidates are having to take their first test , and ca n't quite get away with giving true-or-false answers to the essay questions . Yes , they all support the American troops . They all hope that NATO wins , whatever that would mean . They all believe the Clinton Administration has botched the job somehow or other . But beyond the safe consensus , the problem of figuring out what to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is turning out to be the first test of the candidates ' reflexes , a measure of their principles and their political skills . It is also demonstrating that contrary to the advice of the party wise men all winter , foreign policy may not be such an easy issue for the Republicans after all . <P> Instead of rallying Republicans , the Balkan showdown has exposed how divided the party is over America 's duties in the post-cold war world . After days of tap dancing , by late last week the Republicans had cleaved fairly cleanly between two camps : those in Pat Buchanan 's populist , isolationist fortress who were arguing we should leave Europe to the Europeans , and those who , belatedly in some cases , fell in step behind Arizona Senator John McCain , the former prisoner of war in Vietnam , and called for NATO to fight on even harder to preserve the credibility of U.S. power . <P> The split first surfaced two weeks ago on the Senate floor , when only 16 Republicans voted to support the NATO air strikes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says a top G.O.P. official on Capitol Hill . " This is a party that likes to think of itself as the mirror image of those antiwar protesters who undermined those American boys in Vietnam . But because the situation is so volatile and the President has n't laid out an endgame , it 's hard to react to it . " <P> Forced to try on their Commander in Chief uniforms a little earlier than they might have liked , it was no wonder so many of the presidential candidates at first went searching for camouflage . Most had planned to pad through the complexities of the post-cold war world in careful speeches in front of think tanks that would be largely ignored . Now their strengths and weaknesses are in full view : Buchanan , McCain and Gary Bauer ( on leave as Family Research Council president ) at least have the benefit of strong , albeit wildly different , convictions . Bush has to confront his inexperience ; Elizabeth Dole is determined to show that her positions come from her own work with desperate refugees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Clinton 's envoy on one Kosovo mission in early March ; billionaire publisher Steve Forbes wants to show he really knows the issues , the boy in the front row with his hand up who can tell you his five-point plan , complete with exactly how many tanks there are in Kosovo and Belgrade .
