<p> Almost single-handedly , teenagers have brought to a halt 30 years of steady decline in the number of U.S. smokers . <p> Now , as parents ' admonitions to " just say no " meet with the usual lack of success , government officials have stepped up efforts to stem the rising tide of young smokers . <p> Nobody knows what strategy will work , but the hope is that a combination will decrease the numbers of young people who light up . <p> The most effective public policy to reduce teen smoking so far has been an increase in cigarette taxes . A Colorado ballot initiative for that purpose failed miserably last year in the face of a $ 5 million campaign paid for by the tobacco industry . <p> But studies show that if cigarette prices are increased by 10 percent , the rate of smoking among younger teenagers is likely to decline by 7.6 to 12 percent , says the Government Accounting Office . And in the Journal of the American Medical Association , economist Kenneth Warner estimated that doubling this tax would reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But raising the tax would n't cause Lisa Gedgaudas to quit smoking . The Lakewood 15-year-old said , " I would pay 5 bucks for a pack of cigarettes . " On the other hand , if cigarettes ( a pack now costs about $ 2 ) were that expensive , " maybe I would n't smoke as often . " <p> Lisa gets her cigarettes at Sinclair gas stations - " or any hole-in-the-wall gas station " - and at vending machines at Spinnaker 's in the Cherry Creek mall or Bennigan 's restaurants . In a pinch , her sister and 18-year-old friends get them for her . <p> The issue of cigarette vending machines - once the norm in places like diners , pool halls and coffeehouses - has been thrust front and center . Denver Mayor Wellington Webb wants them banned except from private clubs , businesses that do n't employ minors , and restaurant bar areas - much like an ordinance already passed in Colorado Springs . <p> President Clinton wants them banned altogether . <p> But bans are n't likely to help , contends Sheldon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says only 1.2 percent of cigarette packs were sold in vending machines in 1993 , the last year for which figures are available . <p> Silver 's group surveyed teenagers ages 13 to 17 about where they purchased their smokes . Forty-three percent named convenience stores , 29 percent used gas stations , 11 percent grocery stores , 9 percent vending machines and 6 percent drugstores , said Silver in an interview on National Public Radio . <p> The vending-machine survey also found that 22 percent of 13-year-olds used vending machines compared with only 2 percent of 17-year-old smokers , according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . <p> Colorado another case <p> In Colorado , the number may vary . When Colorado Springs passed its ordinance limiting cigarette vending machines , Cancer Society director Jeanette Minniti said it is found that 40 percent of children 10 to 15 bought their cigarettes that way . <p> After conducting a sting from March to November of 1994 , the Denver Public Health Department found it was easy for minors to buy cigarettes from a variety of sources . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - 84.6 percent - were successful . <p> While Mayor Webb executed an executive order banning sale and advertisement of tobacco products on property owned or operated by the city , the president went after tobacco advertising on a broader scale . Clinton proposed outlawing : <p> Brand-name sponsorship of sporting events . <p> Brand-name advertising on items like hats and T-shirts . <p> Full-color ads in publications with significant youth readership . <p> Smokers say no way <p> Teenagers adamantly deny they are influenced by tobacco ads . Lisa 's 17-year-old friend Alex Crane smokes a pack to a pack and a half a day and thinks it 's absurd to believe anybody would buy cigarettes because of Joe Camel . ( Camels and Marlboros seem to be the cigarettes of choice among teen smokers . ) <p> Alex says he smokes Camels only because he wanted to go to a " lighter " cigarette . " The reason I switched to Camels is I decided to kill myself a little bit less , " said Alex , who purchases his cigarettes in gas stations and liquor stores . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll sell me cigarettes . " ) <p> Lisa , who also smokes Camels , said she had tried to quit , " but it 's hard when all your friends are doing it . As soon as I get back around them , I do it again . " <p> Pediatrician Steve Berman , director of health policy at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , says teens are much more vulnerable than adults to the kind of peer pressure to smoke that Lisa describes . And that peer pressure comes from advertising . <p> They deny advertising is an influence because when teenagers think of advertising , they remember the ads of their childhood - toys and sugared cereal sold with Saturday-morning cartoons , Berman said . But what influences them now is subliminal and much more effective . <p> Cool thing to do <p> Nicotine-addicted teenagers who seek Berman 's help in quitting tell him they started smoking because it 's cool . <p> " Now why is it cool ? " he asked . " It 's all subliminal messages - beautiful people , tough cowboys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Young people are " tremendously vulnerable to the icons and symbols that represent independence , physical attractiveness , rebellion , doing your own thing , telling your parents and other authority figures where to get off , " said Dr. Franklyn Judson , Denver director of public health . <p> " And the tobacco industry would not be spending $ 6 billion with a significant amount of it going to the youth market if they did n't believe it worked . There 's every evidence that it does work . Joe Camel is not directed at adults . " <p> In 1973 tobacco advertising was banned from television but not from print vehicles . <p> " What 's striking to me today is the prevalence of tobacco advertising that still exists in the media , " said Dr. Thomas MacKenzie , who , with Carl Bartecchi and Robert Schrier of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center , published an article in the May issue of Scientific American on " The Global Tobacco Epidemic . " <p> Bombardment of images <p> In televised coverage of the 1989 Marlboro Grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 minutes of the 90-minute production , MacKenzie said . There 's the Virginia Slims tennis tournament and the Camel Motocross . " All of that is advertising , " MacKenzie said , and " images is how people learn to recognize products that are advertised . " <p> One study showed kids ages 3 and 6 logos and products to see if they could be matched . Thirty percent of 3-year-olds matched Joe Camel and cigarettes ; 90 percent of 6-year-olds made the association , the same percentage linking Mickey Mouse with the Disney Channel . <p> To combat this onslaught of pro-smoking propaganda , President Clinton has proposed that tobacco companies be required to donate an annual $ 150 million to anti-smoking campaigns . But MacKenzie said tobacco companies are such master manipulators that they should n't be allowed to create the anti-smoking ads . <p> " I think that 's basically tainted money , " Judson agreed . Last year at school , one of his daughters was given anti-smoking materials that were created by a tobacco company . <p> " It was advanced child psychology , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to get the opposite effect : ' This is an adult habit that is not for you little children . You do what we tell you to do and we are telling you not to smoke . ' " <p> It remains to be seen how much underfunded public policymakers can accomplish by manipulating the law . Nationally , tobacco companies are threatening to sue the Food and Drug Administration ; locally , a package of bills will be presented to Denver City Council . <p> Judson has high hopes , but he is realistic : " One never underestimates the power of the tobacco industry . " <p> SALES POLICY <p> Despite state laws prohibiting sale of tobacco to minors , children can easily buy tobacco products . A review of 13 studies of over-the-counter sales found that on average , children and adolescents were able to successfully buy tobacco products 67 percent of the time . <p> Vending machines are a primary source of tobacco products for young smokers . A study by the vending-machine industry found that 22 percent of 13-year-old smokers use vending machines compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Report found that young people were able to buy cigarettes in vending machines an average of 88 percent of the time . <p> Mail-order sales provide no sure way of verifying age . Current industry practice only asks the consumer to provide a birth date or check a box to verify age . <p> Self-service displays allow children to obtain tobacco products easily . A 1994 Institute of Medicine report titled " Growing Up Tobacco Free " concluded that placing tobacco products out of reach " reinforces the message that tobacco products are not in the same class as candy or potato chips . " <p> Free samples are obtained by children , including those in elementary school , despite an industry code prohibiting distribution to anyone under 21 . Free samples turn up on street corners , at shopping malls and sporting events . A New Jersey survey found that one-third of high school students who were smokers or ex-smokers reported receiving free samples before the age of 16 . <p> Source : U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
