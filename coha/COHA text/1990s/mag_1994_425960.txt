Section : Business Stocks : A sagging Dow and a rush into bonds do n't mean the economy is sick <p> If you 'd listened to David Shulman , the chief investment strategist at Salomon Brothers , you would n't have been surprised by last week 's 3 percent drop in the stock market . Shulman had been expecting it for a while . Stock prices were too high , dividends too low . By last week , thousands of investors seemed to agree . They switched from stocks to bonds , causing the Dow Jones industrial average to drop 107 points to 3708 , which was close to the year 's low of 3593 , reached in April . Shulman expects it to break that barrier and go a bit lower . Meanwhile , the flood of money into the bond market depressed long-term interest rates . The rate on a 30-year Treasury bond dropped to 7.93 percent , down from 8.13 percent at the week 's start . <p> What 's behind this stock-market spasm ? Inevitably , it invites multiple interpretations  --  from a random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plausible explanation seems to be that , collectively , investors are finally convinced that higher interest rates will slow the economy . Surging profits , which had buoyed the market , would then flatten . Shulman , for example , expects inflation-adjusted profits to peak in 1995 , then decline . So the market has buckled under the combined weight of higher rates and disappointed profit expectations . Hardly anyone , however , thinks the sinking Dow is flashing doom . Says economist Anirvan Banerji , a business-cycle researcher at Columbia University , There 's no way we 're going to get a recession . ' <p> It 's true that a stock-market decline has preceded every one of the nine postwar recessions , usually by about five months . But it 's also true that the stock market has frequently dropped sharply without sig-naling a broader economic slump . The best-known examples of these false warnings were the Crash of 1987 ( when the market collapsed 23 percent in one day ) and the Kennedy bear market in 1962 ( when share prices declined 27 percent between late 1961 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sixties expansion continued another seven years , and a recession did n't show up until three years after 1987 's Black Friday . In both cases , Wall Street reached new peaks before recessions began . <p> The economy certainly is n't showing signs of recession now . In October , the number of new building permits ran at a 1.4 million annual rate , up 8 percent from a year earlier . Through September , shipments of appliances ( kitchen ranges , dishwashers ) were 11 percent ahead of the 1993 rate . Nor is there any noticeable sag in consumer and business spirits . The latest Cahners survey of business confidence reports that 69 percent of respondents think sales will be better in three months than they are today . Strong demand has lengthened delivery times and caused scattered scarcities . Transportation bottlenecks  --  freight-car shortages , trucking companies without drivers  --  are more common . Indeed , the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates six times this year , most recently on Nov. 15 , because it fears that excessively rapid growth could increase inflation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliding stock market serves the Fed 's goal of retarding the economy . Almost any story of an economic slowdown goes with a decline of the stock market that leads to a slowdown in consumer spending , ' says economist Laurence Meyer of the St. Louis forecasting firm that bears his name . The theory is simple : with lower stock prices , consumers feel poorer and , therefore , spend less and save more . <p> Superficially at least , Americans are vulnerable to this sort of coercion . Since the late 1980s , they have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into stocks and stock mutual funds . From year-end 1988 through September , assets of stock mutual funds grew from $195 billion to $867 billion , according to the Investment Company Institute . Roughly half the gain stemmed from higher share prices ; the other half reflected new investment . Almost 20 percent of households now own stock mutual funds . <p> As a result , a greater share of personal wealth is now committed to the stock market than at any time since the early 1970s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of households ' net worth , estimates Susan Sterne of Economic Analysis Associates in Greenwich , Conn . This was up from 10 percent in 1980 . Even before the market 's recent decline , Sterne projected that consumers ' real ' net worth ( total assets minus total indebtedness , adjusted for inflation ) would drop in 1994 for the first time since 1990 . The stock-market slump merely worsens the decline . Still , Sterne thinks that consumer spending , adjusted for inflation , will advance 2 percent in 1995 ( down from 3 percent this year ) and that the economic expansion  --  driven by higher exports and strong business investment  --  will continue . It would be extraordinary if consumer spending actually declined ; it has done so only three times since 1950 . Similarly , Meyer predicts that the recovery will last through at least 1996 . <p> Interest rates : The most intriguing forecast comes from the Center for International Business Cycle Research at Columbia University , which sees the next recession starting between mid-1996 and early 1997 . Economists Geoffrey Moore and Banerji @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expansions last . Studying past recoveries , they noticed a connection between changes in banks ' prime ' lend-ing rate and the length of an expansion . The longer the prime rate stayed down , the longer the expansion continued  --  and the relationship is almost perfectly predictable . In the 1960s , the prime rate did n't rise for 58 months , and the expansion lasted nearly nine years . In the present recovery , the prime rate ( now 8.5 percent ) stayed down for 35 months , until last February . That implies an economic expansion between five and six years , beginning in the spring of 1991 . A long period of low rates , says Banerji , allows the economy to build up momentum with investment projects ' that , once started , are hard to stop . <p> Just what all this bodes for the stock market is , as always , everybody 's guess . Last week 's stock sell-off does n't seem to have panicked individual investors . The behavioral shift is among portfolio managers , ' says Richard Hoey , chief economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment funds . Pension-fund , insurance-company and mutual-fund advisers are being urged by investment strategists to shift their emphasis from stocks to bonds . If institutional investors disdain stocks , individual investors might do likewise . <p> All year long , they have committed massive amounts to stock mutual funds  --  $104 billion through September  --  while selling bonds . These shifts helped sustain the stock market and depress the bond market . A dramatic reversal now could have the opposite effect . According to Hoey , inflows into stock mutual funds have recently slowed , although there have not been net redemptions . If there were , funds could temporarily meet them out of cash reserves ( about 8 percent of their assets ) before reducing stock portfolios . But lower mutual-fund sales could hurt the market : mutual-fund activity is a widely watched indicator of market sentiment , and demand for stocks would drop . <p> Market changes , though , tend to be self-correcting . If both stock prices and bond interest rates drop , stocks will become relatively more attractive . The public has been trained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Shulman . Moreover , a lower market would also dry up the underwriting of new stocks . To some extent , then , the lower demand for stocks would be offset by a lower supply of new shares . <p> What really divides market optimists and pessimists now is the outlook for profits . Shulman 's gloomy prognosis , for example , contrasts sharply with the cheerier outlook of Abby Cohen , strategist for Goldman Sachs . She expects profits to rise 10 percent in 1995 and another 6 to 8 percent in 1996  --  well beyond any expected inflation . Once profit reports dispel today 's pessimism , stocks will rebound . A real bear market , she argues , will mean a real recession . Sooner or later , it surely will . Unfortunately , Wall Street 's latest slide does n't say when . <p> PHOTO : Selling all that factories can churn out : Higher interest rates have not slowed appliance sales , which are running 11 percent ahead of 1993 's pace <p> PHOTO : Going up ; The boomlet in construction is far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maine <p> PHOTO : Fully loaded ; Railroads have n't seen a boom like this for decades . <p> By Robert J.
