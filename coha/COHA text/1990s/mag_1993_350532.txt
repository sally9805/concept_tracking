Maybe it 's Mission : Impossible to be Bill Clinton 's Secretary of Defense . Just how do you bridge the gap between a White House focused on domestic problems  --  and headed by a man with no time in uniform  --  and a military wary , to put it mildly , of the new Commander in Chief ? And how do you act convincingly at a time when the U.S. is still defining how it should project its power in a world where the ideological certitudes of the cold war have been replaced by raucous warlords and wild-eyed nationalists ? When Clinton made his choice for the job last December , he could be sure that Les Aspin , who had made a career in Congress as an expert on defense policy , possessed the necessary devotion to the task . As it turns out , he should have wondered more whether Aspin also + had the bureaucratic agility and credibility to work with the armed services . <P> By last Tuesday Clinton had his answer . No one spoke the word fired when he and Aspin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary would be leaving his job in January . But Washington gossip had been building for months that one or more members of the President 's foreign-policy team would have to go . The October battles in Somalia that left 18 American servicemen dead had merely provided a focus for the growing sense that every time the Administration stepped abroad it stumbled . Though Aspin may not have been the man most responsible , he was one of the most visible and vulnerable symbols of the problem . <P> It was a sign of how long the White House had been mulling over the Aspin departure  --  and how badly it wanted to head off another cycle of news stories about the frailty of Clinton 's foreign-policy team  --  that it took just one day for the President to rush out his next choice for the job . Retired Navy Admiral Bobby Ray Inman , a former CIA deputy chief , inherits some of the same problems that bedeviled Aspin from the day he stepped into the job , including gays in the military and the question of when and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small regional conflicts . It also remains to be seen how even an adroit bureaucratic navigator like Inman will manage to court the brass while squeezing their budgets . But from the start it appeared that he would have the stature with both the Pentagon and the public that Aspin never achieved . Even Georgia Senator Sam Nunn , a man accustomed to shaking his head mournfully over Clinton 's judgments on military matters , was full of praise for Inman . " I think it 's a good selection , " said Nunn , adding that he had been consulted in the choice . <P> Aspin 's problems had as much to do with his lumpish style as his policy positions . Rather than narrowing the cultural gap between the Oval Office and the war rooms , Aspin seemed to symbolize it . To the creased uniforms at the Pentagon , Aspin 's rumpled suits and looping , ruminative pronouncements made him seem tweedy and hapless . Oddly for a man who first came to the Defense Department in the mid-1960s as one of the chart-toting whiz kids ushered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a place accustomed to firm decisions and stopwatch timing , he drove Pentagon planners crazy with meetings run like academic seminars , marked by late starts , later finishes and stretches of sedative analysis in between .
