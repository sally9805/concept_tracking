THE FIRST TIME I WAS HONORED BEYOND DESERVING was on a tour of a Hollywood studio as a child . For some reason , I was chosen to go onstage and pet a fake gorilla while it growled dramatically . I got a big hand . For several months after I was badly hurt by a mail bomb , it was the same story , roughly speaking : gratifying but undeserved applause . The public figured that computer technology had been ( in some sense ) the intended victim , and so I became Mr. Computer Science . I was proud to represent a field that has contributed so much in the way of knowledge , jobs , wealth and space-invader games over its brief history , but it was an honor I did n't deserve . There are computer scientists far more distinguished than I , and to tell the truth , I do n't even like computers very much . They pose technical problems that are deep and engrossing , but when there is playing to be done , I 'd much rather play with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to untangle the minor problems the boys ' computer is prone to only when I am up against a wall and Prince of Persia has ground to a dead halt . I do n't want any kidnapped princesses on my conscience . <P> I was especially unworthy to take on the role of representing computer science , because I had written pieces that many colleagues regarded as traitorous . The aspect of my first book , Mirror Worlds , that attracted the most attention was the debate between pro- and antitechnology alter egos ; my skeptical side won . I 'd also published attacks on the use of computers in school . Parents plead for a decent education in the basics , reading and writing and history and arithmetic , and too many teachers respond with vacuous fun and games with computers . <P> As for the suspect to whom ( evidently ) I owe the distinction , I will pass over in silence the fact that he is a Harvard man , and otherwise he does n't interest me . The tendency among some intellectuals and journalists to dignify with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as low and contemptible . I could n't care less what the man 's views on technology are or what message he intended to deliver ; the message I got was that in any society , no matter how rich , just and free , you can rely on there being a certain number of evil cowards . I thank him for passing it along , but I knew that anyway . <P> When I made it back to my office several months after the explosion , it was immaculate for the first time in my career . There had been a fire and the sprinklers triggered , but my friends , colleagues and graduate students had lugged everything to a new office and set things up beautifully . At the bottom of one crate , I found my battered but legible copy of essays by E.B. White . I knew immediately what it was doing there and why it had survived the blast ; it included a short piece called " What Do Our Hearts Treasure ? " White tells in his unsentimental , concrete way about a Christmas he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vague unhappiness and forced cheer  --  and their pleasure when a box arrived from back home in Maine , out of the blue , and proved to be full of fir branches whose scent filled the room .
