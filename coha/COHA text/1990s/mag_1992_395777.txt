WHY IS IT THAT A GREAT many boats supposedly built for fishing come from the factory with rod racks that are incredibly deficient ? Some are so bad they are more likely to ensure rod damage than promote rod safety . To add insult to injury , very few of these racks hold enough rods to satisfy today 's more advanced light-tackle anglers . And considering the rapidly growing popularity of fly fishing in both freshwater and saltwater , the number of rod racks that can not handle anything much over 7 feet in length never ceases to amaze me . The skiff I own today has super rod racks , primarily because over twenty years ago several of us were able to convince the owner of that small boat company that a good horizontal under-the-gunwale rod-holding system had many advantages . I 've also helped build up or modify quite a few other boats over the years  --  two of them for my own use  --  with do-it-yourself rod racks that really worked . Bigger boats can use a combination of storage schemes : horizontally under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the aft edge of a tuna tower , etc . Some of the really good designs on the market even have horizontal rod storage inside lockers ( e.g. the recessed foredeck of an open fishing boat ) . As far as I 'm concerned , angled rodholders in the gunwales are fine for fishing applications such as trolling or live baiting , but poor for long runs at high speeds or trailering on the road . I once had a rod carelessly left in a gunwale angled holder disappear over the side of the boat during a relatively short but fast run in a moderately choppy sea ; I never missed the rod until I arrived at my next stop . On several occasions I 've seen rods bounce out of identical gunwale holders on trailered boats if the road happened to be a little bumpy . Even if recovered , the rods are usually damaged and the reels do n't work very well anymore . Horizontal rod racks are feasible on all but the very smallest of boats . Admittedly , it is n't very practical to stow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartopper , at least not fully assembled , and you wo n't be able to carry six rods per side in a boat that small  --  not even ultralight 5-foot spinning rigs . But I can easily get eight casting/fly rods per side in my 16-foot skiff , and even a 14-footer two of us built up almost a decade ago could carry four to six rods per side . Assuming your boat already has sufficient gunwale overhang inside the cockpit to help protect the rods stowed thereunder , adding suitable racks is essentially a matter of installing two vertical supports per side . Extra-long rods like fly rods or casting sticks over 7-1/2 feet , however , will often require some additional support . If you do n't have inside gunwale overhang but would like to add that too , there 's a relatively easy way to do so . The rod racks can be made of wood , which is n't expensive , and you can easily cut it yourself . Plastic is another option , but this is much more costly , and in most cases you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Since wood will last virtually forever , I 'd suggest it as the most practical choice  --  at least for your first effort . The easiest way to get the right fit for under-gunwale rod supports is to first make templates out of cardboard . The supports should be no more than 48 inches apart ; otherwise short rods will flex up and down severely when the going gets bumpy . There must also be enough space between the aft support and the transom or any other bulkhead for the rod handles . All rods except fly rods are best supported immediately below the reels . As for the tips , if there is excessive curvature where the longer rods makes contact with the hull , you might want to add the protection of PVC tubing . The heavy walled variety is n't needed , and in fact is more difficult to work with , so use the lightest you can buy . The tubing can be supported in any way that 's suitable for your boat , since it wo n't have to carry any weight . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the longest rod can not project beyond the far end , or you 're likely to damage some line guides . And , if you wish , you can easily flare the rear end of the PVC by dipping it in boiling water for a minute or so , then expanding it with anything large enough to get the job done  --  a soft drink bottle , for instance . Unless there 's so much curvature in the hull that the tubing can not be made to conform by hand , you wo n't have to heat it to bend it . But if you do , the easiest way is to plug one end and fill it full of boiling water . Pour the water out after a minute or so , and then quickly push the tubing against the curvature of the hull so that it fits . Hold the tubing there until it cools sufficiently to retain the desired shape . Obviously , it is prudent to wear thick gloves or use potholders while engaged in this maneuver . The rod supports can be anchored from the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the boat is made of aluminum . They can also be fiberglassed to the inner hull or inner sides of a fiberglass hull . Top support , along with a flexible adhesive ( like 3M 5200 ) used to anchor the supports to the side of the boat , is the method I 've obtained the most satisfactory results with . If you do n't want to drill down through the gunwales to attach the supports , you can use sturdy aluminum angle stock to do the same from the underside . Both methods have worked well for me . If you find it desirable to add gunwale overhang inside the boat , you might want to use the rod racks as vertical supports . This usually is n't necessary , however , so whether or not the racks themselves actually touch the cockpit floor is n't important . On some of the smaller round-chine aluminum skiffs I 've modified , it was n't even practical . Adding gunwale overhang is n't difficult , and can be done even with aluminum utility boats that have just a small boxed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diagram omitted ) All it takes is a few pieces of clear ( knot free ) 1x2-inch lumber , and maybe some 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch exterior or marine grade plywood in you want the results even wider . For sections where the hull curvature is too much for the 1x2 to bend without the risk of breaking , make relief cuts 2 inches apart , halfway through the wood . The last time I widened a gunwale this way , it was still as stiff and strong as ever many years later. , long after the hull was completely worn out . The wider , stiffer gunwales also considerably reduced the tinny sound of the aluminum hull . To keep the rods in place in the racks , the horizontal U-shaped cuts should be angled downward around 30 degrees . A short piece of elastic shock cord ( bungee ) for each separate rack will prevent the rods from bouncing out on choppy days . Since the cord will need to be replaced every year or two , I drilled a hole through the top of my rack , then added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A round electrical connector with a base large enough for the bungee to slip through fits over the screwhead . Just knot one end of the bungee , slip it through the hole in the top of the rack and then through the base of the electrical connector , and tie another overhand on that end . For a worthwhile finishing touch , line the U-shaped cutouts with cork sheeting or thin indoor carpet , which will protect the finish on the rods . Contact cement will keep the lining in place . <p>
