Beatee 's lover was made of lip . She would n't say more , just smiled , delicately tracing the edge of her glass with one finger . Susannah , more than anyone else there , knew Beatrice 's theatricality , her beautifully detailed gestures . Susannah , more than anyone else there , knew that to give way to her curiosity was to give way to Beatrice . <p> Still , " Lip , Beatrie ? " she murmured , trying to sound wry and doubtful . <p> " Uh huh . " Beatrice 's smile broadened and shone on Susannah ; she finished her wine and turned to get more . <p> Was she the only one in Renata 's living room who had heard Beatrice ? Susannah wondered . Or did the others take the casual statement as an example , either of Beatrice 's extravagance or of her hyperbole ? No one but Susannah seemed particularly interested . And beside the delicious , disturbing image of Beatrice 's lover there was only one though t in Susannah 's mind : not to show Beatrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the old days . <p> " Wan na see something ? " Beatrice would whisper . They were sammies then , refugee kids at a Samaritan school after the Big Everything the disaster of ' 19 which had wiped out so much of New York City . " It 'll cost you a halfie . " And Susannah had found the half-dollar coin hidden in her pocket and given it to Beatrice , and had been permitted to view the dead cat or the page tom from an old pom magazine or , once , the body of a bum who had frozen to death outside the school the night before . <p> " Wan na see something ? " Beatrice would whisper . And every time , every damned time she fell for it . <p> Even now , twenty-five years later . The most Susannah had learned to do was look indifferent so that the others at the party  --  friends of Renata 's , who was a sammie too  --  would n't notice her fascination . <p> Later , when the party was breaking up , Beatrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamerlane . " I have to stop home , anyway . Come in , I 'll give you some real coffee . " <p> Susannah opened her mouth to say no , and was unsurprised to hear herself say Yes . Old habit , old captivations . She followed Beatrice up to the copter on Renata 's roof . <p> " I 've named it Abelard , " Beatrice said as she fastened her seatbelt . <p> " Why not Dante ? " Susannah asked , trying to play the game . <p> " Too obvious . " Beatrice smiled , a whiteness glittering in the dusk . She flicked a row of switches and the copter hummed to life . In the fading daylight and the green glow of the instrument panel , Beatrice looked unearthly , vivid and perfect , her long fingers manipulating the toggles and dials expertly . <p> " Besides , " she added once they were up in the air . " Abelard sounds sexier . " It certainly did the way Beatrice said it , a sigh rolled along the tongue . <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where did it come from ? " Finally , unasked , Beatrice said , " I had him made for me . One of the bioengineering places squeezed my order in between batches of interferon or something , I understand it is n't hard to do . Just expensive . " Beatrice lingered on the word . " A parent tissue , a little fuddling with DNA , program in some instincts . . . . " Her voice was an elegant drawl , only her smile in the near-darkness was lewd . " There 's only one in the world , and it 's mine . " <p> " Beatie  --  " Susannah murmured . <p> " I know you 'll keep this a secret , love . It 's not breaking the law , but . . . bending it a little . " <p> Susannah stared into the deepening gloom . Below them scavenger boats fished scrap metal from the Long Island Sound ; to the right in the distance the squat buildings of the rebuilt South Bronx Hospice glittered silently . After their hungry , grubby childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , built up a small independence for herself . Grubbed for money , Beatrice said , and shook her head . Her path had been very different . Beatrice had worked only as long as it took to find , and marry , Felix Ferrar-Giroux , one of the mysteriously wealthy men who had emerged after the Everything . He took her home to Tamerlane , a huge house on the Sound that unfolded like a tesseract , disclosing rooms where none could logically be , and there Beatrice learned to spend his money . He encouraged her extravagances as if he were feeding a rare bird . No impulse too wild , no whim too expensive . Including , it appeared , this new extravagance . <p> I will keep my mouth shut , Susannah thought grimly . I will look at her new toy  --  despite herself a flush of warmth spread through her at the thought  --  and then I will go home . <p> At Tamerlane they were met at the door by a superior-looking manservant who took Susannah 's three-year-old cloth coat with as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sue to a small den and poured wine for them both . <p> " You must relax , Susah ! You take everything so seriously . There , drink that . Why are you so edgy ? " <p> " I 'm not edgy , but I have work at home I need to get through tonight . " <p> " Susah , you ca n't let work rule your life , " Beatrice said irritably . " <p> I do n't let it rule my life , Beatrice  --  " <p> " What else rules your life , then ? You have n't had a love ; since whatsisname walked out  --  " <p> " Greg , " Susannah whispered . <p> Beatrice made no sign of hearing . " You wo n't enjoy yourself , you act like you have n't earned the fight . That 's the difference between us : you think you have n't earned anything . I know I 've earned everything I can lay my hands on . We survived , Susah . We 're alive . We do n't owe anyone anything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair back from her broad forehead with one hand and looked up at the ceiling . " Why do I bother ? Come on , love . Let 's go meet Abelard . " <p> They went down a string of corridors , stopping just as Susannah began to get seriously lost . The room Beatrice led Sue into was almost empty , uncarpeted , dimly lit , painted a shining white . The floor was a parquet pattern , doubtless of real wood . There was a clean soft smell to the air , like talc or running water ; two lush throw rugs and a futon in the comer , a fern hanging in a ceramic pot . Nothing stirred . <p> Beatrice crossed the room . " Shut the door behind you , Susah . " Then she went through a door at the far side of the room . Susannah had a moment to look around curiously , breathe the sweet air , wait for revelation . <p> " Come on , precious . Come on , sweetie-pie . " Beatrice stood in the doorway a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Something moist and gibbous squirmed uneasily into the room behind her , moving by throwing its weight forward , falling and rolling over until it " stood " again . It was ovoid , dull red , strangely plastic , with a faint sheen that gave no impression of sliminess . Ugh , Susannah thought , but was unable to take her eyes away as the thing rolled after Beatrice like a puppy after its master , struggling with that sidling somersault to keep up with Beatrice 's elegant long stride . <p> " Abelard . " Beatrice stopped in the center of the room , one palm extended to present the thing to Susannah . With the other hand she reached caressingly down to it and it responded , stretching upward in an effort to reach her circling finger . At last they touched , and the thing grew round her finger , nursed it . For the first time in all the years she had known Beatrice , Susannah saw her entirely captivated , not thin king of the next moment or the next , caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one finger . <p> The mood was contagious . Susannah 's faint revulsion at her first sight of the thing dissipated . She felt a warmth and sweet laziness born of the fragrant humidity of the room and the unsettlingly erotic sight of the creature suckling Beatrice 's manicured finger . She sighed quietly in the stillness . <p> " Do you want to touch him ? " Beatrice 's voice sounded abnormally loud . <p> Susannah tried to make her murmured Yes seem casual . She stepped near , reached out a finger and touched , tentatively , at the side of the lover . " Abelard ? " she murmured . The thing did not move toward her , but it did not move away , either . Sue pushed her finger a little harder . The surface of the lover was warm , firmer than she had expected . Like lip . It gave slightly , then closed around her fingertip and nursed at it , tasted it . Susannah felt a string of electric pulses ripple up her spine ; the flesh surrounding hers was damp and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like him , " Beatrice said smugly . At the sound of her voice Abelard released its grip on Susannah 's finger , dropped away and shrank back , its rolling weight carrying it toward Beatrice . " Hello , Pet , " Beatrice crooned . " Is devoted to Beatie , is n't its . Is got Beatie under its skin , has n't it ? " She ran a caressing palm flat along one side of Abelard 's top while Susannah , shivering in the warm air , tried to regain her composure . Then , abruptly , Beatrice pulled away from the lover and turned to the door . " Come on , Susah . " <p> Susannah followed , trying to ignore the tremor that lingered in her arms and breasts and knees , making walking a shaky , uncertain chore . From the doorway she took one backward look and saw Abelard , shrunken and forlorn , abandoned in the center of the room . <p> " Potter will move it back to the tank later . " Beatrice waved a vague hand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tanks . " <p> " It spends most of its time in a nutrient bath . Or something . I told the people at Bioform I did n't want to know particulars , they 're so unromantic . Potter takes care of him . It . Now , I promised you real coffee , did n't I ? " <p> Susannah had forgotten about the work she had waiting in Manhattan . She followed Beatrice mutely back to the sitting room where a lavish meal , with the promised coffee , had been laid out . Through the meal and the copter ride into the city , where Beatrice landed on the roof of Susannah 's building in violation of any number of ordinances , through the rest of the evening and the next day , Susannah was haunted by the memory , the teasing sensation of that warm flesh suckling at her finger . Which was just what Beatrice wanted , she told herself scornfully . An audience , someone to want what she has . <p> Which is just what Susannah wanted . <p> Sue saw Beatrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut , sometimes at a restaurant in the city for lunch . With her usual perversity Beatrice did not mention Abelard , but sometimes in the midst of talking she would break off in mid-sentence and smile deliciously into space for a moment , then start theatrically , " What was I saying ? " Sue believed these lapses were contrived for her benefit , but that did n't diminish their power . She was grimly certain that Beatrice understood that all too well , and was grimly determined to show herself unmoved . <p> Other than lunches with Beatrice , parties or weekends at Renata 's , or her occasional work-related social duties , Susannah did n't seek out contacts , friends , lovers . Her last man had decamped more than a year before , in a shower of mutual accusation and disappointment , and Susannah could n't nerve herself to try again , even approach trying again . Too messy , certain to fail , just not worth it , she said to Renata when she asked about Susannah 's love life . To Beatrice she said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . She was not quite busy enough to forget the unsettling image of Beatrice 's lover , nor the ghost sensation of the thing sucking on her own finger , even after months had gone by . <p> One day , several months after the visit to Tamerlane , Beatrice called her at work , arranged to meet for lunch . She bubbled and enthused , every word was an event , and by the time she put the phone down Susannah knew that Beatrice had some new extravagance and needed an audience . Needed her . She made arrangements to take an extra hour for lunch ; her superiors looked kindly on her lunches with Beatrice Ferrar-Giroux . <p> They met at a small restaurant in the rehabilitated section of the east Fifties . The place had not yet been discovered by anyone but Beatrice , who would relentlessly drag it into fashion and then tire of it . Today she was dressed like a wealthy gypsy , scarves and beads and skirts layered around her so that she looked half-buried in bright fabric . Her hair was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , radiantly pleased with herself and the world , and Susannah immediately loathed her own blue suit , which that morning had seemed fashionable and attractive , and her simply dressed dark hair . <p> " Susannah ! " Beatrice rose and enveloped Susannah in a spicy , overwhelming embrace full of foreign enthusiasms and endearments . Susannah returned it carefully , fearful of disturbing Beatrice 's artful disarray . <p> Before the first drink had arrived Beatrice was launched on an epic , a saga of her life since they had last met . By the time the second drink and the faux salmon appeared Beatrice had arrived at the crux of her story . A new lover , a man . He was beautiful , he was bright and shining , incredibly sensual , a gypsy , a madman . He had been , until Beatrice discovered him , a gardener at Tamerlane . <p> " Who 's doing the garden now ? " Sue asked dryly . Beatrice blinked , laughed , and went on . By the time the consomme arrived Beatrice had descended from flowery abstracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not until the waiter served the veal and poured more wine that Susannah could get a word in edgewise . " What 's going to happen to Abelard ? " <p> Beatrice looked at her blankly for a moment . Then , " Oh God , that 's right . I had n't even thought . Well , after all , Susah , it 's only a blob , is n't it ? I 'll have to tell Potter to take it back to Bioform . " <p> Beatrice was paying for the meal ; it was not often that Susannah could afford real meat , let alone cheese and fruit and wine this good . She ate every bite . It tasted like dust . Over coffee she asked , " What will Bioform do with him ? " <p> It took Beatrice a moment to understand what Susannah was talking about . <p> " Put it back in the vat or something , I suppose . Recycle the ingredients . Something . Really , Susannah , " Beatrice drawled . " It was only a toy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew . She was supposed to change fascinations as Beatrice did , just one step behind . She shook her head and changed the subject back to Beatrice 's new lover . <p> When they were putting on their coats , Beatrice regarded Susannah with the old look : satisfaction wanting to flaunt itself . " Susah , you must come meet him . When can you come out to Tamerlane ? " <p> She faltered , thinking of the work on her desk , the reports in her briefcase waiting to be taken home . Then Susannah surprised herself . " Tonight . I can come tonight , after work . " And do what ? Fight free of the place with Abelard tucked under one arm ? Ridiculous . Still , " Tonight , " she said . <p> " I wo n't say good-bye , then , " Beatrice said . " I 'll pick you up at six ! " She smiled again , suddenly irresistible and childlike . " Ooo , Susah , wait till you see ! " And then was gone . <p> Flying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her like warm , scented water . Potter waited at the door to receive their coats and lead them to a different small den . Susannah wondered briefly if Beatrice had a suite of mores for each lover she took : row on row of white rooms with the small of running water and one green vine in a whit e ceramic pot . She settled herself in a deep soft chair and sipped wine , thinking . A young man , very tall and muscular , with a face of masculine prettiness and a slow , assured walk , joined them . Susannah noted that he was as besotted with Beatrice as she was with him . <p> " Susannah , this is John . " Beatrice pulled the young man down to sit beside her on the sofa ; their fingers found occasions to touch , and the air between them rippled as though superheated . Susannah looked away uncomfortably , embarrassed . When Potter announced a call for Beatrice the lovers rose together and left the room . Potter looked at Susannah as if she were part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hear Beatrice 's soft murmuring from the antechamber , the click of the phoneset replaced in its cradle , but neither Beatrice nor John returned . She thought she heard more murmurings , the soft sighing of silk against skin and skin against skin . Her face warmed as she realized that Beatrice meant her to hear , wanted her to hear . Probably thought it was a great gift to her poor friend Susah , she thought in disgust . <p> She rose and left the room . If anyone stopped her , she would say she was looking for the lavatory . No one stopped her . It took her three tries to find the right corridor , the right door . When she entered the room she found it empty ; the futon and white rugs had been rolled up and piled on one side , the vine trailed unwatered from its dusty pot . The air was still and musty . She walked across the bare floor and opened the door to the inner room carefully , afraid she might startle the creature . <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brimmed with viscous pink fluid . It looked like photographs Susannah had seen of human hearts prepared for transplant ; there was something lonely and pathetic about it . Ugh , she thought . How could anyone  --  but Susannah thought she knew how . She stood very still , just inside the room , listening to her own pulse and breathing watching the faint pulse of the lover in its tank . She was only aware that Potter had entered the room behind her when he cleared his throat . <p> " I was only looking  --  " she began . <p> Potter regarded her steadily and said nothing . <p> " I mean , it 's horrible , just putting the poor thing back in some sort of vat , as if it were clay or something . I mean  --  " she faltered . " When does he  --  it  --  go ? " <p> Potter smiled thinly . " When Madame remembers to instruct me . " <p> Susannah nodded , still staring at Abelard in the tank . " I just mean , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just destroy it . It must feel something . . . . " <p> " You want it , " Potter stated baldly . <p> " It should be saved , " Susannah corrected . She kept her gaze fixed on the lover . " We ca n't just let Beatrice throw it out . lt 's alive . It just seems . . . . " She faded off . The only sound in the room was a faint hiss and bubble from the tank . <p> Then , We might arrange something , " Potter said . He closed the door behind them , shutting , them into the humid , medicinal-smelling room with the creature " Something could be arranged , " he repeated . Sussanah looked at him as he told her what . <p> They negotiated , As Potter made his offer and Susannah her counter offer , she thought of the warm sucking at her finger , the firm plastic surface of the lover . Her breath came faster as she calculated her slender resources , the money she had saved for years , hoping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought of little economies she could make , freelance work , extra income . <p> When she left the white suite Susannah and Potter had come to an agreement . <p> All the way back to Manhattan , tiding with Beatrice in the copter , Susannah was aware of a new sensation , a smugness Beatrice herself would have recognized . She had taken something from Beatrice , sad Beatie would never know it . It would be her own . <p> Sussanah spent her lunch hour st the bank the next day , transferring money to the account Potter had named . As she wrote the figures out Susannah had a brassy taste in her mouth , a moment of cautionary fear : What am I doing ? Then sanity was overwhelmed by the rising image , the image she had lived with for months now , of the lover at her fingertip , nursing gently . Susannah signed the bank chit recklessly and went back to work . <p> Potter was early . When the security guard at her building door called up for clearance Susannah was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painfully neat room on which she had lavished all her energy , choosing fabrics and art that would create s sense of space and graciousness . Except for the dark wood folding table on which her dinner sat half-eaten , the apartment was in order . She went to the door to wait . <p> " Good evening , Miss . " Potter might have been opening the door at Tamerlane for her , rather than she for him . <p> " Good evening , " Susannah replied seriously . <p> It took only a few minutes to move the shrouded can across the room , slide the tank as gently as possible onto the floor , unstack the cans of nutrient fluid which Potter had brought along . " Part of the accouterments , " he told her . Then he looked around the apartment once , shook his head as if his worst fears had been confirmed . <p> " Well , Miss , " he said at the door . " I hope it gives you great . . . pleasure . " <p> Susannah blushed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gave that up . " Good night , Potter . " <p> " I certainly hope so , Miss . " <p> When he was gone , Susannah turned back to the apartment , seeing the drying track of fluid dribbled from the tank and the shifting sprawl of Abelard against the plastiglass walls . The tank and cans of fluid took up a space about a meter square , displacing an armchair she had stored away in the basement . Her heart beat so strongly she felt the pulse under her jaw . Susannah walked toward the tank . The pink fluid on the floor smeared greasily under her foot . But when she reached out a hand and touched the lover its surface was not greasy , scarcely even damp . At her touch , Abelard slowly stirred , enveloping her fingertip in warm , firm flesh , just as she remembered . <p> Susannah drew away . Some ritual was demanded . The lover sank down into its tank again while she cleared the dishes and started a bath . She soaked for a long time in water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toweled herself dry . When she could think of no further reason to delay , she set about her seduction . <p> First there was the clumsy process of getting Abelard out of the tank . The lover did not reach for her as it did to Beatrice , nor follow the sound of her murmurs , her heat and scent . But when touched it did respond , reaching upward to her . After a moment Susannah figured out how to use its weight to move it , letting the lover overbalance and roll forward over the beveled top of the tank wall . Even so , Susannah had to pull with both hands , palms flat against the malleable flesh , until the creature was wholly out of the tank . Susannah stared at her palms , which tingled from the contact . <p> Abelard waited , unmoving . Tentatively Susannah reached out again and touched it , stroking the warm surface . The flesh of the lover kissed her hand , rising to follow the line of her arm , nibbling tenderly at the soft skin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting , pushed gently at Abelard 's surface with her free hand until it was enveloped in soft , suckling tissue . The lover was warm like the touch of breath against her skin . Seen closely its surface was a dusty rose , lined , porous and unappealing ; after a moment Susannah closed her eyes . Then there was only the touch , the slow sliding pressure on her arms , a kissing of flesh on flesh . <p> In the still of the room there was the faint singing of her breath and nothing else . She floated from touch to touch at the lover 's whim ; there was nothing to do but be there , be touched . No responsibility for the lover 's pleasure , no necessity for talk or reassurance . Just her own sensations , intoxicating . Abelard swarmed over her , nuzzling and kissing , rocking her gently in the first orgasm , clinging warmly . <p> Gradually the stroking at her throat , her breasts , her inner thighs and labia became more insistent , probing . The lover seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Susannah was once distantly aware of how strange it was to have no one to hold on to , no shoulders or buttocks to knead . When she stroked the lover its skin kissed back , another sensation , distracting , and after a moment or two she let her hands fall to her sides . <p> The lover went on stroking , probing , kissing , shape-changing . Susannah grew tired , overexcited and raw . Her languor turned into heavy-limbed paralysis : it was impossible even to shudder away from the ceaseless warm caress that went on and on . At last , dizzy to fainting , Susannah rolled away from the lover , shivering in the sudden uncovered cool of the room . She lay for a long time , boneless , flushed and exhausted against the pillows . When she turned over she saw Abelard , vaguely forlorn , returned to its squat ovoid Shape . She knew she should put it back in its tank again  --  how long since she had coaxed it out ?  --  but it was still difficult to move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a robe , to attend to the lover , urging it back toward the tank and , at the last , pushing it over the shallow rim again into the nutrient bath . At the first touch of her hands the creature began its slow kissing again . Susannah felt as if every cell in her body was electrified by sensory memory ; after the quick shove it took to up-end Abelard into the tank , she pulled away , panting again , waiting for the electric charge to dissipate . Foggy with surfeit she sank back to the floor . After a while she drifted to sleep where she lay . <p> At work the next day Susannah was tired and stiff . She found herself drifting into daydreams , her eyelids suddenly heavy and her mouth pursed in a soft " o " as if by surprise . Pressing her legs together she could summon up a flush of physical memory that was momentarily incapacitating . She felt a little drunk ; she smiled often . At the stroke of five she cleared her desk and left . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tinted pink or filled with musky scent , something exotic . It was the same two small rooms , her careful decorating scheme knocked awry by the tank in the comer . Susannah allowed herself a brief glance at the lover , then committed herself to ritual : dinner , small chores , a bath , all prolonging the expectation . Finally , when she could not distract herself further , she took Abelard from the tank . <p> It was as it had been the night before : soft caressing flesh , ripplings of sensation , her body bathed in warm kisses . Even when the pleasure began to mix with pain she could not stop , convinced by her body that the final sensation , the perfect sensation , was only a moment away . When languor gave over to exhaustion , sensation which broke itself , pleasure which hurt too much to bear , Susannah rolled away shaking , listening to her heart pound in the silence of the room . <p> In the next few days Susannah developed dark patches under her eyes , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be in the apartment and not eventually succumb to the lover 's allure . Beatrice called and Susannah said guiltily that she had no time for lunch . Renata called and Susannah pleaded a head cold . At home it piqued her that Abelard still had to be cored to her . She remembered the way the creature had yearned toward Beatrice 's hand , her voice . What had Beatrice said ? That it was programmed to respond to her physical chemistry . In time , Susannah thought , the lover would learn her chemistry , respond to her , not Beatrice . <p> Abelard had been in her apartment for a week when Susannah noticed a callus , a small rough patch on its surface . When she touched the patch the lover responded instantly , sucking gently at her finger . <p> " No , sweetie , " she murmured absently . Concerned , she checked the nutrient fluid , but it was the same dear , uncontaminated pink it was supposed to be . For a moment Susannah entertained thoughts of sexually transmitted diseases , explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chided the creature . " There is nothing wrong with you . " Still , when she took him from the tank that evening she made sure the leathery patch was turned away from her . <p> The next night the patch seemed larger . <p> Beatrice called again , insisting upon lunch . They met , embraced , and Beatrice was launched into her narrative before they had taken their seats . This time , though , there was a difference . After a few minutes , Beatrice broke off and stared curiously at Susannah . <p> " All right , what is it ! " she asked . Susannah trembled . " What is what ? " <p> " Susah , you 're off in neverland somewhere , you have n't heard a thing I 've said . It must be something . You 've met a man ! Tell me . " <p> " I have n't met a man . " Susannah was enjoying herself . " All right , a woman , then . Tell . " <p> " I have n't met anyone , Beatrice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susannah smiled seraphically . Beatrice 's frown was petulant . <p> " Well , do n't tell me . " Her bad humor lasted another few minutes and then was forgotten as she launched into gossip about her gardener-lover at Tamerlane , about Felix and their parties . By the end of lunch she had talked herself into charity with Susannah again : " You must come out to Tamerlane soon . I 'll even find a gardener for you . " <p> Susannah smiled politely . They embraced again and she turned away . Behind her she felt Beatrice watching curiously , for once in all their lives the puzzled one . <p> That night as the lover churned over her body Susannah was suddenly aware of the complete silence , the lack of another breath contrapuntal to hers , no words , no noise at all . Later , when she rolled Abelard back into the tank , she found two new leathery patches , and the first was definitely larger , and cracking faintly . Before she left for work the next morning Susannah examined the lover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she opened two cans of nutrient and recklessly dumped them into the tank . As her hand grazed the lover it nestled sluggishly . Poor thing , she thought . Up close in the light of day it was really kind of awful looking . <p> She was late at work , haranguing with a customer in Zurich over duty compensation ; when she got home she had only enough energy to wash her face and fall into bed with a curious sense of relief . She did remember to check Abelard for further sores then or in the morning . All day she was conscious of an edginess ; that night , for the first time , she did not bother with her rituals but pulled off her clothes and tumbled the lover out of its tank as soon as she arrived home . She did not really look at it until later , afterward . The firm , pliant skin was scaly and withered , as if the creature itself had shrunk inside its flesh . The first of the calluses was cracked and oozing faintly . Susannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower the touch of it from her . She did feel some brief compunction , and dropped more fluid into the already brimming tank before she went to sleep . <p> The lover was dull brown by morning and the fluid in the tank was contaminated with small particles . Susannah was horrified , thinking of the touch of that thing on her body only hours before . When she got home the lover was dead . <p> Susannah knew it the moment she opened the door ; there was no smell , but a sense of presence in the apartment was abruptly not there . Abelard floated in the tank , shriveled and dark , strands of peeling skin suspended in the murky fluid that surrounded it . Susannah wanted to close and lock the door to her apartment and disappear . <p> It took her a while to think what to do . Finally Susannah dragged the lover out of the tank and wrapped it in an old towel . Its withered form was surprisingly light and much smaller than it had been alive . Clutching the bundle tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garbage room in the basement . Then she pushed it away from her violently , heaving the creature and the towel into a trash can . The sight of the gray-brown husk half hidden by terry cloth in the bottom of the can was the final straw . Susannah fled , weeping , back to her apartment . It was some time before she thought to empty the tank of its tainted nutrient and bring it , and the remaining cans of fluid , down to the basement . <p> Then Susannah went into some kind of mourning , reducing her already small world to a simple loop of work and sleep . She lost weight , the former tidiness of her apartment declined into dusty clutter . She saw no one outside of work . The thought of people dismayed her . Friends called , Beatrice and Renata , an old boyfriend back in town , a man from work . Susannah left the phone off the hook and fell asleep each night to the rhythmic whine of the signal . Daily she watched what she was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nothing changed . <p> At last Renata got through to her . A party at her place in Connecticut . Susannah would have to come , someone would certainly give her a lift out . Of all the people she had known from the Samaritan school , emphatic , generous Renata was the one Susannah liked best , feared least , and was most likely to ignore . But today Renata used her most persuasive voice and best blandishments . Perhaps , Susannah thought , it was time to go out . <p> Renata was delighted . " Wonderful , wonderful ! Listen , Beatie 's coming I 'll tell her to give you a ride out . Wonderful ! Wear something nice , sweetie . There will be some lovely men . " <p> Men . Susannah was not ready to consider the idea . And of all the people in the world Beatrice was the last one with whom she wanted to ride out to Connecticut . She thought of calling back and canceling , but the habit of inaction was just too strong . It was easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattering before Susannah had closed the door of the copier : how had she been , where had she been , why all the mystery ? " You look marvelous , Susah , so thin ! But you just dropped out of sight . I was right , was n't I ? You had a new lover ? My God , love , it 's been months since I 've seen yOU . " <p> Susannah agreed that it had been months , and stared stolidly down at the forest of spires below them , the slowly reemerging Manhattan skyscape . <p> " I should have tried harder to get hold of you , I know , " Beatrice went on , expertly guiding the copter east over the Sound . " We 've been all at sixes and sevens out at the house , even poor Felix had to get tangled up in it . Can you imagine ? We had to fire Potter . " <p> Susannah felt a hollowness in her stomach , as if the copter had suddenly made a two hundred foot drop . " Fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 'd been taking advantage  --  they all do , it 's expected , up to a point . But Potter overstepped the bounds . " Beatrice 's long eyebrows arched in amusement . " Do you know , he actually took it upon himself to throw out my little toy ? You know , that thing I had made  --  " <p> " Abelard , " Susannah whispered . <p> " God , Abelard . What a memory you have . Felix was convinced that Potter had sold the poor little thing on the black market , but I ca n't imagine anyone buying it . " <p> Susannah stared straight ahead . What did Beatrice know ? Was this one of her dreadful teasing games ? <p> " I mean , there would n't have been any point , " Beatrice continued . <p> She 's waiting , Susannah thought , for me to pick up my cues . " Why not ? " she asked . <p> " It could n't have been used by anyone but me , love . Not for long , anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way would have poisoned it , like an allergy . Potter knew that , the Bioform people told him , for heaven 's sake . He knew there was no point in anyone buying it . Unless he sold it as food , and that 's too revolting a thought even  --  " <p> Susannah leaned against the door of the copter , wishing it would open and drop her into the water five hundred feet below . Beatrice went on and on and on . Susannah did n't listen . She was concentrating on not throwing up as the copter dipped and canted in the early evening breeze . In her mind she played over the picture of the lover , of Abelard , draped in her bathroom towel and discarded in the trash . <p> Renata was waiting for them , chivvied them into her small house , already packed with people . " Susannah , sweetie , you look like death . You were airsick , were n't you ? Beatie , you fly that damned thing like a maniac . Go take off that dreadful fur and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bathroom . <p> " Really , Susie , are you all right ? Do you want to talk ? " Her ann around Susannah 's shoulders , Renata sat them both down on the side of the tub . Distantly Susannah felt the warmth and weight of Renata 's arm around her . " Susie ? " <p> Susannah shook her head , afraid to speak . Finally she managed , " Fighting off a bug or something . I 'll be okay . Thank you . " <p> Renata squeezed her again , then stood up . " All right , Susie . You do n't have to tell me what it is , but fix yourself up and come out as soon as you can , will you ? This is a party , love . You 're here to . . . to part . " She smiled with pleasure at her own silliness , kissed Susannah 's cheek and left her . <p> Susannah stared around the blue and white lavatory , at the embroidered hand towels and sculpted soap . Here to part . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Maybe . With Abelard ? Another wave of deep nausea : she had killed Beatrice 's lover , she had been deadly , the damned thing had died giving her pleasure . <p> She looked at herself in the mirror . Her face was pasty white ; she splashed in icy water until some color returned to her face , then pushed at her hair until it fell a little more softly about her face , so that some of the stricken look diminished to mere fragility . Come out as soon as you can , Renata had said . <p> She thought of the lover , of the cool silence in her apartment , the safety of it . Then , with sudden warmth , she wanted caring , the human clamor that filled Renata 's hallway , the sticky , confusing , demanding and personal world outside the bathroom door . Friendships . Chaos . Love . It was time to go out . As she opened the door she thought she felt something warm at the nape of her neck . A brush of memory like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Madeleine Robins has published several novels , and now works as an editor for Acclaim Comics . She last appeared in F &SF; in July of 1944 with an historical fantasy . This time she returns with an odd bit of sf . When Madeleine sent us this story , she billed it as " an sf story about two women and a lip . " It is that , and oh , so much more . <p>
