Section : Articles This is the second and last installment of our symposium on the Middle East peace process , begun in our August 26 issue . <p> <p> <p> Yitzhak Rabin <p> <p> AN UNUSUAL coincidence of events has in the last two years substantially improved the prospects for advancing the peace process in the Middle East . There is no certainty that this extraordinary situation will persist beyond the next two or three years , and if the peace process does not begin during the next few months , this historic opportunity will be in jeopardy . <p> This coincidence of circumstances is mainly connected with the dramatic change occurring in the Soviet Union , which put an end to the cold war . As a result there is now in fact only one superpower , namely , the United States . The Soviet Union is now a sort of American satellite , as we saw during the Gulf War and in the message brought by the Soviet ex-Foreign Minister , Mr. Bessmertnykh , during his mission to the Middle East some weeks ago . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i.e. , accept Baker 's proposal to convene an international peace conference . <p> The second event is the Intifada of the Palestinians in the territories administered by Israel . For the first time since 1948 , the people living in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip now lead in the struggle for their self-determination , thus effectively shifting the focal point of the Palestinian issue from the PLO officials in Tunisia and Baghdad to the local leadership . These leaders now are in the international limelight and have more practical and moral weight than the outside ' Palestinians . Another important event is also connected with the situation in the Soviet Union . The gates of that country now are wide open to Jewish emigration . Nothing is more important for the future of the state of Israel , its existence and security , than substantially increasing its Jewish population . The flow of Jewish immigrants from the Soviet Union is now very considerable , and can be even larger . Israel urgently needs loans , subsidies , and strong economic relations for the sake of its immigrants as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the political process stalls , Israel will have difficulty in getting the financial assistance required to absorb the new immigrants . Moreover , in view of the recent revolutionary changes in the USSR , it is feared that Jewish immigration to Israel may dwindle , and so the Jewish people and the state of Israel risk losing a unique historic opportunity . <p> In my opinion , the peace process can begin very soon , but no one should expect magic formulas and shortcuts . The process will be complex and difficult , there will be ups and downs , but the chances for success are greater than the dangers . <p> There are in Israel two approaches toward the peace process and how it should be conducted . The first approach has proved its effectiveness since 1949 ( the armistice agreements between Israel and its four Arab neighbors ) and up to the peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 . According to this step-by-step approach , Israel should not simultaneously negotiate with more than one Arab country at a time . Egypt has been the first partner for negotiations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations with one country are concluded and a peace treaty is signed should the negotiations with another Arab country begin . <p> The second approach attempts to solve the Arab - Israeli conflict as a whole , by convening an international or regional peace conference in which Israel and all its Arab neighbors would take part . This approach has not yet led to any tangible results . <p> The peace initiative of the U.S. Secretary of State , James Baker , based on the second approach , calls for a regional conference to be convoked . The meetings will begin with a plenary session . After the opening session , the talks will break up into bilateral , face-to-face negotiations : Israeli - Jordanian - Palestinian discussions , and negotiations between Israel and every Arab country that wishes to join the talks . <p> I believe that the first approach , as expressed in the peace initiative of the National Unity government in May 1989 , had better chances to succeed . This was an Israeli initiative supported by the U.S. and Egypt , and its main emphasis was on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this initiative an elected or agreed-upon Palestinian delegation from the residents of the Territories would be an equal partner in negotiations with Israel and Jordan . This initiative was built on a three-step process . The first step was to be establishing a representation elected by and from among the Palestinians living in the Territories . The second step was to be establishing a self-governing authority in the Territories ( not including East Jerusalem ) , as an interim solution for a five-year transition period . The third phase , which would have begun no later than three years after the establishment of Palestinian autonomy , called for beginning negotiations toward a permanent solution . These talks were to be attended by Israel , Jordan , the Palestinian representation , and other interested parties . The negotiations were to be based on Resolutions 242 and 338 of the UN Security Council . By the way , the nomination of the Palestinian delegates to the preliminary meeting in Cairo was almost agreed on in February/March 1990 , when Likud ministers of the National Union government thwarted the process . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only operative proposal . The initiative will be deemed successful if the meeting actually takes place and if the promoters succeed in separating the negotiations with the Palestinian ( or Jordanian - Palestinian ) delegation from the talks on the second track , i.e. , between Israel and other Arab countries  --  or , in fact , with Syria . Any attempt to connect the two tracks will lead to a deterioration of the general situation in the area . <p> For all the above reasons , the ability of the statesmen who are responsible for implementing the Baker initiative , and who wish to advance the peace process , will be proved if they succeed in convening the regional peace conference isolating the Palestinian issue from the negotiations with Syria . <p> <p> <p> Hafez Ismail <p> <p> THE MIDEAST conflict results from an accumulation of problems during the last century . The central problem is the confrontation between Jewish and Arab nationalisms . This conflict , however , has spread to neighbors of Palestine , raising questions of sovereignty and security . And the conflict has been exacerbated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . <p> Nonetheless , the central problem remains the relationship between Jews and Arabs in Palestine . No line can be drawn within Palestine to satisfy the security and sovereignty claims of both peoples . And the approaches to a resolution of this central problem  --  whether the resolution is seen as a unified secular and democratic state ( as the PLO suggests ) or a Zionist state with a genuinely safeguarded Arab minority  --  are completely blocked by the subsidiary problems that it has created . Advocates of any long-term settlement must first help create the conditions where it can be possible . <p> The Palestine problem will require at least a two- stage solution . The immediate goal is self-government for the Arabs in the territories occupied since 1967 . Within three years , negotiations toward the longer-term Palestinian goal , the formation of an independent state , should begin . This second stage , however , can not begin until other Israeli - Arab conflicts  --  the occupation of the Golan , the security zone ' in Lebanon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The last stage  --  which should begin within five years  --  is gradual movement toward a final settlement , guaranteed by the Great Powers , of relations within Palestine and of Jewish - Arab relations generally . <p> Certain matters of procedure will be essential during that long move . ' An international conference must reinforce the role of the UN in the new world order and provide guarantees for the initial agreements . And the right to self-determination for the Arabs of Palestine  --  recognized by the UN 's Universal Declaration of Human Rights  --  must be defended by all world democracies . <p> While negotiations must proceed step by step , ' the final goal must be clear . The U.S. should give the Arabs written confirmation of its recent promises regarding elements of a final settlement . It should also reveal what commitments were made to Israel by previous Administrations , e.g. , on Jerusalem and its Arab population . Finally , the Jewish settlers in the occupied territories must be withdrawn , or agree to accept Arab control of the areas in which they live . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territories , in exchange ceding Arab areas it has controlled since 1948 . <p> A conference of Israeli and Arab representatives , with European and Gulf observers , ' now seems likely in the near future . Many important conditions , including the composition of the Palestinian delegation , are as yet ambiguous . Moreover , Israel will seek to delay negotiations in order to improve its negotiating position  --  first by holding its own general elections , then by taking advantage of the United States ' absorption in its 1992 presidential campaigns . <p> Nonetheless , a two-track direct negotiation among existing territorial states will take place . One track will be negotiations concerning the Golan ( the results should be similar to those of the 1978 Sinai settlement ) and Lebanon , where access to water , border security , and terms of Israeli and Syrian withdrawal must be established . <p> What direction the Palestine negotiations will take will depend on the composition of the Palestinian delegation . If Palestine is represented by inhabitants of the occupied territories , the conference can begin the step-by-step negotiation described above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions for its permanent domination of the West Bank and Gaza . <p> A joint Jordanian - Palestinian delegation to the conference would probably try to avoid the step-by-step negotiation and reach an immediate settlement permitting Jordan to assume sovereignty ' over the territories while allowing Israel to guarantee their security '  --  to keep its troops on the Jordan River . However , such a settlement  --  the Jordanian option  --  is unlikely to succeed , events having proven that security has no frontiers . ' <p> The Great Powers will attempt to guarantee the conference settlement . However , this alone may not guarantee stability in the region . Arab public opinion may determine future developments , particularly if there is a failure to realize a just peace . <p> <p> <p> James Craig <p> <p> I HAVE always been a pessimist about the chances of finding a solution to the Arab - Israeli dispute . But if ever there were a chink of light at the end of what continues to be a very long tunnel , it is now . <p> That 's because President Bush and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as many of their predecessors were not ) that the dispute is so harmful and dangerous that a really serious effort must be made to find a solution ; that in the new , post-Gulf-crisis situation the international scene , both in the Middle East and in New York , offers a mood and line-up in which the possibility of devising a solution has been greatly enhanced ; and that the principles of the available solution ( roughly speaking , land for peace , the return of most of the occupied territories to Arab administration in exchange for Arab recognition of Israel 's sovereignty and guarantees of her security ) are both just and expedient . <p> This solution has been acceptable to both sides , but never to both sides at the same time . Before 1967 Israel would have warmly welcomed Arab recognition and would have accepted a Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza , which were already under Arab administration . But at that time the Arabs were not offering such terms . Now the Arabs are offering them ; but Israel , being in possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear is that in future years , when changes in power and demography have had their effect , the Israelis will become interested but the Arabs will by then have withdrawn the offer . <p> So now is the time . The Arabs have come a long way to meet the American proposals . They may well come further once negotiations start . For a ) the old polarization of the dispute ( Arabs + USSR v. Israel + USA ) has broken up , and the Arabs realize they are dependent on the U.S. broker ; and b ) because of the Gulf crisis the leading players on the Arab side  --  Syria , Egypt , and Saudi Arabia  --  have come , at least temporarily , into the habit of co-operation with the U.S. and are more hopeful of American bona fides . <p> But that bona fides has to be demonstrated . The way it ought to be demonstrated is by real pressure on a reluctant and over-cautious Israel to accept the principle of land for peace and to haggle only about details ( boundaries , guarantees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the negotiations reach that stage , a settlement will be in sight , even if it has to be achieved in stages . <p> With peace envisageable , albeit over the horizon , even an answer to the knotty problem of Jerusalem should not be beyond the wit of man . There are plenty of ingenious constitutional lawyers who could devise ingenious arrangements to preserve an open city and shared sovereignty . There are precedents in other parts of the world for compromise systems of this sort mutatis mutandis ( e.g. , the Vatican , Andorra ) . <p> But before we reach that stage , what will certainly be needed is genuine pressure on Israel to accept the idea of compromise . That is where what I want to see diverges from what I expect to see . Moral suasion is not going to be enough . The wielded stick and the withheld carrot will have to be brought into play . Yet no American President since Eisenhower has been willing to get so tough with Israel . And even if Mr. Bush were willing , would Congress let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public opinion about Israel ( though not so big as in Europe ) . Mr. Shamir 's intransigence has been severely criticized , even by organs of the Zionist lobby . The notion that Israel is a pillar of liberal values has been weakened by the harsh handling of the Intifada , by various public scandals , and by the presence of men like General Sharon in the Israeli government . The idea that Israel is a Western fortress in the Middle East , a stationary aircraft carrier from which Western interests in the region can be defended , has been exploded by the events of the Gulf crisis , when , so far from exploiting Israel , we had to bribe her to keep out . In Europe at any rate Israel is seen as a liability to which we have a moral obligation , not an asset from which we can derive benefit . <p> All this is true . But viewed from London , thousands of miles from Capitol Hill , it did not seem nearly enough to encourage or even to permit President Bush to threaten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least until the controversy over the deferral of loan guarantees . If I am right , I fear Shamir will stand pat . That is what I expect . If it happens it will be followed by the increasing alienation of the Islamic world , a process whose shadow we have already seen in Jordan , in Algeria , in Pakistan , and even , in a paler but still threatening form , in countries that are allies of the West , like Egypt and Saudi Arabia . Such a divide between East and West might well be a disaster : it would certainly be a danger to peace , to oil supplies , and to our hopes for democracy . <p> <p> <p> Ralph de Toledano <p> <p> HISTORICALLY , the concept of a Middle East peace is oxymoronic . From ancient times , competing imperialisms have fought for this junction of three continents . Under the Ottomans there came to be a semblance of peace in what the Romans had called Palestine , but a ruinous one as the land slipped into depopulated swamp and desert , wrapped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The countryside was sparsely inhabited by roving bands of Bedouins and the cities predominantly by Jews who had remained from Roman times or returned in the following centuries. * For the Middle East as a whole , the situation changed with the discovery of oil . For Palestine , the League of Nations mandate accelerated the Zionist tide ; high wages and superior living conditions brought in a flood of Arabs from other areas . <p> Discussions of peace in the Middle East seem always to focus on an Arab - Israeli conflict which is of minor dimension when compared to the internecine wars of Islam . The Iran - Iraq conflict lasted for eight years and cost well over a million casualties . The Syrians under the bloody dictatorship of Hafez Assad claim the entire Fertile Crescent as Greater Syria '  --  and their invasion and occupation of Lebanon was but a first step . Saddam Hussein 's irredentist Iraq makes similar claims . Jordan , carved out of two-thirds of the mandated Jewish homeland by the British , ostensibly to create a homeland for the Palestinians , ' has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries that pointedly refused to recognize the illegal incorporation of the West Bank by King Hussein 's invading armies . Jordan went to war with the PLO during Black September '  --  driving it into Lebanon and killing off more Palestinian Arabs than Israel has ever done . <p> If Israel were to disappear tomorrow , the Middle East would remain a cockpit in which Moslem dictators fought for hegemony . Yet each day 's news is full of press accounts about the Israeli-occupied lands '  --  though those lands were formally granted to the Jews after World War I by the League of Nations , whose mandate was recognized by the UN after World War II . It is never mentioned that the so-called West Bank holds Safed and Hebron  --  two of Judaism 's holy cities  --  or that the pre-1967 boundaries ' so hallowed in propaganda song and story were not boundaries at all but truce lines fixed when the UN stopped the expulsion of Jordanian and Egyptian invaders by Haganah in 1949 . The actual boundaries were to be determined by a peace conference , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been ready to negotiate with Israel . <p> Subsequent peace efforts have always foundered on the rock of U.S. ignorance and State Department ill-will toward Israel . The Arabism of State is well known , but the efforts of Secretary of State Henry Kissinger to double-cross Israel  --  efforts which led even the motherly Prime Minister Golda Meir to declare that she would have nothing more to do with him  --  have never been given currency by the American media . On the other hand , there was also the rescue of Israel by President Nixon during the Yom Kippur War in 1972 , in spite of his ambivalent feelings toward Jews in general . <p> Before there can be Israeli - Arab peace , there must first be a recognition by the United States that it is not wedded to the forgotten dictum of Lyndon Johnson when he was in the Senate : I do n't have to worry about Israelis or Jews ; I come from an Arab state . ' Israelis fear that what Senator Johnson said half in jest , Secretary of State Baker believes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an Administration which grows apoplectic when Israeli police kill nine Arabs in putting down a violent riot , but have not a word to say when the Syrians in Beirut kill five hundred Arab Christian prisoners . <p> There will be fruitful negotiations only when President Bush and Secretary Baker lean on the Arab states to sit down at the conference table with Israel and to recognize the legitimate existence of the Jewish state . But so far , all that Secretary Baker 's several missions have achieved is the introduction of the Soviet Union into what is laughingly called the peace process . ' In so doing , he has antagonized not only the Jews but the Arabs . He has also made no objection when Saudi Arabia , which leaves a blank on its maps for the land of Israel , has refused to talk peace with Israel and brought the other Gulf states along with her . On the other hand , he glowers at Israeli leaders because they want guarantees that he will not lead them to a Middle East Munich . <p> The United Nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borders were defined in a 1970 Pentagon study which held that the country would be perilously vulnerable unless its borders were set close to the Jordan River , leaving but a sliver of territory to the Palestinians . The Israelis today would not go that far . The Arabs , however , want all or nothing at all  --  as their internal propaganda discloses . They stand no chance to eliminate Israel , even with the help of Secretary Baker . So as has been true ever since World War II  --  when the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem , vociferating from Berlin , called for the slaughter of the Jews and the British as well  --  the chances are that the Arabs will get nothing at all . Or at least until Secretary Baker stops peddling rugs and turns to honest diplomacy . <p> * An Ottoman census of 1844 gives the population of Jerusalem as 7,120 Jews , 5,000 Moslems , and 3,000 Christians . In 1922 , when the British Mandate began , the population of Jerusalem was 33,971 Jews , 13,413 Moslems , and 14,699 Christians . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerusalem and expelled the Jews , the mix was 100,000 Jews , 40,000 Arabs , and 25,000 Christians . <p> ILLUSTRATION : Map of the Middle East .
