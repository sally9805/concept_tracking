The blind Muslim cleric stumbled forward and butted the microphone with his head before a minder steadied him . Another aide whispered the presidential oath in his ear as he pretended to read the words out loud from the folder thrust into his hands . It was an awkward beginning in front of the national assembly for Abdurrahman Wahid , a stroke victim who last Wednesday became the first freely elected President of Indonesia . And it was a bitter denouement for Megawati Sukarnoputri , the presumed front runner who had been left sucking for air by a series of political maneuvers she had n't even seen coming . <P> Back in his seat , Wahid , 59 , appeared to doze for a time until he was helped to the podium again to make his acceptance speech . After promising economic reform , Wahid cut his speech short , " because the longer I speak , the more we will have to account for later . " The 700 delegates burst into laughter as the tension evaporated . The man fondly known by the nickname " Gus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frailty , neither his wit nor his wits had deserted him . <P> His truly brilliant piece of manipulation was yet to come . Even as Megawati dabbed at her tears and her supporters were rioting in the streets outside , the wily Wahid was engineering a compromise under which she would be voted Vice President the following day . Indonesia underwent yet another of its dizzying mood swings . Within 24 hrs. , the Molotov cocktails and rocks that had pelted the police were replaced by victory chants and firecrackers as Megawati 's followers turned the center of Jakarta into a street party that lasted into the small hours of Friday morning . <P> Indonesia would be an easy diagnosis for a psychiatrist : manic-depressive . In the 18 months since former President Suharto was deposed , the country has lurched repeatedly from giddy euphoria to violent despair and back . But despite the ethnic violence , lynchings and looting in major cities and the carnage in seceding East Timor , this sprawling archipelago of 210 million people has not disintegrated into ungovernability or civil war . Some had predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Indonesia had instead completed its graduation from a military-backed dictatorship to the world 's third largest democracy ( after India and the U.S. ) . " Indonesia is born again , " said military historian Salim Said . " This is a chance to finally see if civilians can run the country or not . " <P> It is a steep challenge . Healing Indonesia 's frayed psyche will mean confronting a host of ethnic and religious wounds , as well as tending to a shattered economy that the World Bank says has suffered the worst decline of any since World War II . And if the bizarre twosome of Wahid and Megawati , so different in almost every other aspect of their characters , have one thing in common , it is their lack of experience in government .
