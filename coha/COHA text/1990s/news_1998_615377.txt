<p> M. Douglas Ivester has steered the ship for 14 months  --  a period of flux for the world 's largest soft drink company . <p> The most visible concern has been worldwide economic jitters , which have been a drag on Coca-Cola Co. ' s overall soft drink sales . The situation has n't been helped by flooding in China , riots in Indonesia and currency devaluations in some of the company 's major emerging markets . <p> While the company and some analysts say the problem is short-term , the concern nonetheless has crimped earnings and sent Coca-Cola 's stock price into a 29 percent plunge since its 52-week high of $ 88.93 3/4 in July . <p> On Friday , Ivester met with analysts in New York to warn that fourth-quarter earnings will be as much as 20 percent off what analysts expected . On that news , and word that the company 's financial outlook is n't expected to improve until mid-1999 , the stock closed at $ 62.87 1/2 , down $ 3.18 3/4 . <p> But that 's not the only storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring on the competition with its new Pepsi One diet drink , which some say poses a threat to Diet Coke 's dominance . And then there 's Pepsico 's pending federal antitrust lawsuit against Coke , alleging unfair trade practices in the U.S. fountain market . <p> Yet through it all , Coca-Cola 's chairman and chief executive has maintained his trademark bulldoggedness and optimism about the company 's long-term prospects . And he 's doing his part to see that goals are reached . <p> In his boldest move since taking the helm after Roberto C. Goizueta 's death in October 1997 , Ivester announced Friday that Coca-Cola is buying London-based Cadbury Schweppes ' beverage brands in 120 countries for $ 1.85 billion . <p> The native of New Holland , Ga. , took time out Friday to discuss the deal , and Coca-Cola 's future , with The Journal-Constitution : <p> Q : Given the worldwide economic situation , do you expect that volume growth  --  at least for the near term  --  will have to be driven by acquisitions ? <p> A : No , not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one-time step where you 'll have some volume added to our system on a one-time basis , but then after that we would expect our business to be in line with the longtime range that we 've talked about before . <p> Q : And that goal remains an annual 7 percent to 8 percent growth worldwide ? <p> A : Exactly , but now we 'll just have to grow 7 to 8 percent on top of a bigger base of business . But we 're confident with our ability to do that . This is one of those unique situations where it 's a win-win for both parties . It 's a win for Cadbury because they get to capitalize on what their potential would have been separate and distinct . And we get to capitalize on what the potential is when you incorporate this into our overall systems . <p> Q : Will this boost that 7 to 8 percent growth goal eventually ? <p> A : Again , think of it as a step function where you take one step up and off of that increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plus the additional business , by the 7 to 8 percent . <p> Q : Would Coca-Cola be interested in other parts of Cadbury 's worldwide bottling system , other than Spain and Ireland ? <p> A : In terms of bottlers that are out there , we have existing bottlers in all of those communities and we would n't enter into a bottling situation that was competitive to an existing bottler that we have out there . My guess is some of the Coca-Cola bottlers out there might be interested in some of those properties . <p> Q : How has the worldwide economic situation helped push along this deal ? <p> A : What you 're seeing from a regulatory standpoint out there is there 's consolidation taking place in every industry . Automobiles , banking , telecommunication , retailing  --  it 's across the board that this consolidation is taking place . Certainly the soft drink industry is not immune from the economic forces that lead to that . Now certainly these brands and the Schweppes organization would have survived and prospered independent and on their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of being under the umbrella of the Coca-Cola Co . <p> Q : Are there areas where you think there are going to be regulatory concerns in getting this approved ? <p> A : Sometimes a regulatory issue arises because of anticipated layoffs and those kinds of things . <p> And here , none of that takes place . This is something that 's going to be good for the local economy , good for the local government . We do n't really anticipate any strong issues out there . <p> Q : How will this impact the relationship in the United States between Coca-Cola and Cadbury Schweppes ( which is keeping its beverage operations here ) ? <p> A : We have a good relationship in the U.S.  --  our bottlers carry some of their products . That 's been a situation that existed for many , many years . And we understand it , they understand it , and I do n't see that it 's going to alter it in any way . <p> Q : Do you think that it 's going to intensify the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because they 're going to have a lot more money and they would be able to put that into their own bottling operation ? <p> A : You 'll have to ask them what they intend to do with the money , and draw a conclusion based on what they intend to do with the money . If they put the money in the candy business , that 's a different story . <p> Q : At ( Friday ) morning 's analyst meeting , you did n't really address the 1999 earnings outlook , other than what you 've said in the past . Why not ? <p> A : Each one of the analysts who are in the meeting are competitive . They all have their own model . We do n't tell them what the number is . They all have their models , they all have their expertise , they 're all smart people and they all make different assumptions . One of them assumes the dollar 's going to go one way , another one assumes the dollar 's going to go another way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going and the fact that the expectation is going to be lower than thought for the fourth quarter , should investors be concerned ? <p> A : ... Should investors have been concerned about the Coca-Cola Co. in the 1930s in the U.S. ? Should they have been concerned about the Coca-Cola Co. when Latin America was having some turmoil in the 1980s ? The answer is , this is a long-term business . ... The company has demonstrated the ability to build per-capita consumption of its products over 113 years , and I believe when you look out 10 years from now that you 're going to be very , very pleased that you made an investment in the Coca-Cola Co. in 1998  --  in the fourth quarter of 1998 , even . There 's nothing about the current environment that we see that changes our fundamental outlook on this business . <p> Q : And that 's what you 've said all along ... <p> A : By the way , I said that in 1982 , when the company 's stock dropped 10 percent . It went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everybody was asking the exact same question . And everyone that I know that bought that stock at $ 1.80 feels really good today . <p> M. Douglas Ivester ' biggest move is the Cadbury Schweppes acquisition . / Special
