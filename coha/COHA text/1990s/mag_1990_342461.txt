So Congress wants to reassert its constitutional prerogative to decide whether or not the nation should go to war . About time . U.S. Presidents have gone much too far toward claiming ( or rather exercising without even bothering to claim ) the power of Louis XIV to send a whole nation into battle on his sole judgment , even whim . The makers of the Constitution were determined never to give one man that power in the new republic , and they were right . If the U.S. is to fight Iraq , it should be by conscious decision of its elected representatives , reached after full debate . <P> But that debate should not be dominated by the antiwar critics , as the front and op-ed pages have been in the past few days . In a full-fledged congressional debate , one may hope , the case for war will be argued more forcefully and cogently than an oddly tongue-tied Bush Administration has lately managed to do . And there is a compelling case for war . Yes , even if one believes , as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week or so by heavy bombing , but may turn into a long , bloody and disruptive struggle with major casualties . <P> Oil is one reason , and to make ( not concede ) that point is by no means to admit that we would be fighting for a few cents a gallon on the price of gasoline or to maintain a fat , self-indulgent life-style . What is at stake is the power to shut off the heat in millions of homes , freezing the old and frail ; to close down thousands of factories and utility plants , causing mass unemployment and no little additional poverty . A price run-up or supply restriction sharp enough could touch off a similar worldwide recession  --  and an inflationary recession to boot . That power can not be put into the hands of a megalomaniac who can be trusted to deal with anyone who might try to stop him by squeezing in the most vulnerable spot . And if Saddam Hussein gets away with his seizure of Kuwait , he will be master not only of the supplies from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion or bullying , of the oil pumped out of Saudi Arabia , the gulf sheikdoms and other states . Of course , the U.S. should have acted long ago to lessen its dependence on foreign oil . Of course , it should do everything it can in that direction now . So what ? For the immediate future , a reliable supply of oil at affordable prices is vital to any modern economy . It just is , and the loftiest moral and ecological disapproval can not change that brute fact . <P> But oil is not the only or even main cause for war , whatever the cynics say . Would the U.S. have fought to conquer the Middle Eastern oil fields if Saddam Hussein had peacefully persuaded Kuwait , Saudi Arabia et al . to restrict production enough to shoot the price up to $40 per bbl. ? Get real . The central issue is aggression , and how  --  make that whether  --  it can be contained in the post-cold war world . And forget all the moaning about shedding blood to keep feudal autocracies in control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more appealing victims and potential victims to champion . But if &lt; aggression is to be opposed only when the targets are kindly liberal democracies , the world is going to become a far more dangerous , savage and bloody place .
