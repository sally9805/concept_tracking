Construction worker James Pough did more than kill ten people and wound seven in Jacksonville last week . He also shot holes in the gun lobby 's rationale for opposing even modest efforts to keep firearms out of the hands of violent criminals . <P> In 1971 Pough pleaded guilty to the fatal shooting of a man . Yet he was able to buy the two handguns and acquire a 30-cal. assault-style rifle that he used in his murderous rampage . <P> The National Rifle Association has urged voters to reject a bill that would require a three-day waiting period to check the background of potential gun purchasers . If such a check had uncovered Pough 's criminal record , he would not have been able to buy the guns he used last week . Asking gun buyers to wait a few days to complete their purchases seems eminently reasonable if it helps prevent madmen like Pough from going off on homicidal binges.
