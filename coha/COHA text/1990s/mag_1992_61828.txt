When we remember New Orleans , it will be for the heartbreak . Time and again the crowds at the 1992 U.S. Olympic Track and Field Trials were transfixed by champions running or vaulting in pursuit of their dreams , or for justice , or for millions of dollars . And time and again they saw dreams dashed , justice thwarted , fortunes squandered . There was classic racing , crowned by a near world-record 19.79 in the 200 meters by the masterful Michael Johnson . There was wild gratification , as displayed by Jim Spivey in winning the men 's 1,500 after years of injury and fourth-place finishes . A tough , seasoned team was chosen . But it was the losses , the mounting losses , that imparted a melancholy gravity to the occasion . // Four of the nine Americans who won individual world championships last year will not be going to Barcelona . A fifth , 100-meter champ Carl Lewis , will only be long jumping , having finished sixth in the 100 and fourth in the 200 in New Orleans . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kingdom and ' 91 world champion Greg Foster did n't make the team . Middle-distance runners Steve Scott , Joe Falcon and Mary Slaney did n't make it , either . And even these losses , tearful and wrenching as they were , paled before that of Dan O'Brien , the most talented decathlete who has yet lived . // Last Friday night , after finishing the first five events of the decathlon with a record total of 4,698 points , O'Brien was relieved . He had sprinted the 100 and the 400 strongly , had jumped long and high and had put the shot a personal best of 54 ' 5 " , despite the fact that he was still recovering from a stress fracture of his right fibula . All that concerned him now , he said , was the pole vault . He had not vaulted in a meet all spring . // But the next day , after scoring solidly in the 110-meter hurdles and the discus , O'Brien warmed up well in the vault . On his last practice jump , he cleared 16 ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawning 512 points , it did not enter the imagination that he would not win this decathlon from his friend and celebrated rival , Dave Johnson , by an embarrassing margin . Indeed , if O'Brien were to vault somewhere near his best of 17 ' " , he would have an excellent shot at Daley Thompson 's world record of 8,847 points . O'Brien passed four early heights and started at 15 ' 9 " . // His first jump was an awkward somersault below the bar . He had n't been able to control the bending pole and bailed out . " This scares me , " said Fred Samara , TAC 's decathlon coordinator , who was sitting with Mike Keller and Rick Sloan , O'Brien 's two coaches . They all knew a decathlete scores no points if he makes no height . Jim O'Brien , Dan 's father , knew it too . He had tried to take a picture of his son vaulting but found he was so nervous he could n't press the shutter release . // On his second attempt , O'Brien rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , sending it bouncing off the standards . He had one try left . Samara was ashen . // Twice O'Brien started his run and stopped halfway to the pit , sensing that his steps were off . After the second abortive attempt , he walked back , toweled off , took up the pole like a long lance and started his final approach . He slammed the pole into the box , swung up and began to stall . Well before he neared the bar , he knew he could not clear it . He kept a hand on the pole and curled almost into a fetal position before dropping to earth , his eyes shut , his face a mask of agony . He was suddenly in 12th place with only the javelin and the 1,500 remaining . They are his weakest events . // " I felt numb at first , " O'Brien would say . He attributed the misses to pressure , to the way a man 's chest becomes granite when he suddenly sees the abyss . " I wanted to turn to somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening to me . Do something . Somebody do something . ' " // O'Brien went to a skybox at Tad Gormley Stadium and wept . Then he , Keller and Sloan huddled with decathlon expert Frank Zarnowski , who confirmed for them the awful , unbelievable truth : It would be impossible for O'Brien to make the team . Their decision to start at 15 ' 9 " now looked like the worst tactical blunder in trials history , with immense costs both competitive and financial for O'Brien ( box , page 18 ) . " You 'd think they 'd get something down , some mark , something in the bank , " said Jim O'Brien with terrible wistfulness. // Yet there had been good reasons for Dan to let the bar climb past the early heights . The temperature was 91 , and it was hotter on the track . The heat and his stress fracture made it important that Dan not take too many jumps . Further , Team O'Brien believed that 15 ' 9 " was safe , mundane . " I jump that as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't remember a day when I did n't clear that height . " // " He made 16 feet in warmups , " said Keller , " so we decided to come in one height below . You 're talking about a 17 ' " vaulter . We felt confident about it . We 'll take the consequences . " O'Brien 's coaches are good , sympathetic men , but it is O'Brien who will have to endure the consequences . // Johnson , meanwhile , climbed into first by clearing 17 ' " . He then set an American decathlon best in the javelin with a towering throw of 244 ' 8 " and ran the 1,500 in 4:27.17 to finish with 8,649 points . In the trying , muggy conditions it was a superb score , and he will go to Barcelona as a lonely favorite . // O'Brien 's failure was enough to shake one 's faith in the U.S. 's time-honored , cutthroat , one-shot , **37;0;TOOLONG , no-exceptions trials . " I do n't know how good our system is , " said Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't get Dan O'Brien to the Olympics . " Hearing this , O'Brien , who displayed affecting humor and grace to the trials ' end , applauded wildly . // O'Brien met his end with no warning . Butch Reynolds , however , went to his fate deliberately , through a week-long gantlet of police escorts and ostracism by his competitors in the 400 meters ( page 98 ) . On June 20 the Supreme Court had barred TAC from enforcing an IAAF ban  --  the result of a hotly contested suspension for steroid use  --  on Reynolds 's participation in the trials . The IAAF , stung , had then threatened to suspend the 31 other 400-meter men if they ran against Reynolds . While TAC officials pleaded with IAAF president Primo Nebiolo to relent , the runners blamed Reynolds for their fix . // In all of track history , six men have broken 44 seconds for 400 meters . Four of them were in the trials final . Reynolds , whose world record is 43.29 , was in Lane 4 , his eyes cloudy , green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watts of USC , who had run 43.97 in the semifinals . Outside Reynolds were the 1988 Olympic champion , Steve Lewis ( a best of 43.87 ) , and the bronze medalist in Seoul , Danny Everett ( 43.98 ) . Everett was one who had castigated Reynolds for jeopardizing the whole field to pursue his case . // " I tried to explain , tried so hard to make them see , " said Reynolds , " that the injustice the IAAF was doing me  --  suspending me after I was exonerated by TAC 's own doping review board  --  it could do to them , and that the IAAF threat to suspend them was wrong , and that we had to stick together to challenge it . But I could n't do it . The money they could make running in Europe in the summer seemed to mean so much to them . They 'd rather have one summer 's financial gain rather than the rule of law . " // It was more complicated , more human , than that for most 400 runners . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who held the world record for 440 yards , who coaches Watts and who coached Everett and Lewis at UCLA . Smith was not insensitive to the IAAF 's capacity for overkill because he was suspended in the mid 1970s for taking part in the International Track Association , the first , failed attempt to make track a professional sport in the U.S. " I was hung out to dry for five years , " said Smith . // Smith told Watts that in the short run the IAAF he knew would proceed without mercy against any rebellious runners . He also told him that in the long run , if Reynolds prevailed in his cause and the IAAF 's abuse of power were checked , the sport , and Watts , would be better off . Watts asked whether he should go long or short . " Based on my experience , " said Smith at last , " I ca n't advise you to challenge the IAAF that I know . " // And no 400-meter man did , save Reynolds and his brother , Jeff . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 , few would shake Reynolds 's hand . " The isolation was the worst then , " said Reynolds . " I thought of Tommie Smith and John Carlos on the victory stand in 1968 . I thought of Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela . Those guys had it hard . I can only admire their strength now . " // While in the blocks before his first-round heat , he heard a spectator cry , " Make them pay , Butch ! " and he did , blasting to a 44.58 , an unprecedented time for a heat and a waste of energy . " The emotion was so great I could n't hold back , " he said , panting and exultant . In his quarterfinal that evening , he burned to a 44.68 . Clearly he had the ability to transform anguish into performance , but for how long ? " What we 're witnessing is the outrage of an innocent man , " said Reynolds 's coach , Brooks Johnson , " but sooner or later he 's got to hit the wall . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was occurring . Some of Reynolds 's opponents were voicing grudging respect . Watts was so excited at having Reynolds in his semi that he flew to a 43.97 , drawing Reynolds , who came in second , to what seemed a controlled 44.14 . Reynolds seemed capable of capping his crusade with one last , angry , victorious run , although the IAAF was certain to throw out his Barcelona entry once it was submitted by the U.S. Olympic Committee . // In Friday 's final Watts began tentatively , feeling fiat . Everett , in Lane 6 , established a swift , even pace , and Lewis keyed on him . Reynolds dug out hard , feeling little rhythm but determined to substitute force of will . That never works in the 400 . Reynolds led on the backstretch , but Everett and Lewis caught him on the last turn and strode smoothly ahead . Watts passed Reynolds in the stretch . Reynolds eased and lost fourth to Andrew Valmon. // Everett 's winning time was 43.81 , the second-fastest 400 ever run . " This was the culmination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran 44.08 and Watts 44.22 . Reynolds 's 44.65 for fifth made him only a relay alternate , with no guarantee of running in Barcelona . " I 'll go , " he said , " but I wo n't try to make them let me run . How can I ? I did n't earn it . I went crazy making my statement in the early rounds . I had nothing left . " // He will pursue a civil suit against the IAAF , and one of his lawyers , John Gall , spoke intriguingly of extracting millions in damages from the international governing body . But a day after the final , Reynolds was in a gentler mood . " It 's hard to know the effect I 've had on how people feel about the issue , " he said . " I wonder how many hearts I 've touched . " // Smith 's for one . " Butch believes in what he 's fighting for , " he said . " A lot of us could take a lesson . " // Slaney took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicing running with the pack . Precariously short on training after an operation on her left foot in March , the 33-year-old Slaney had withered in the 3,000 early in the week as PattiSue Plumer , Shelly Steely and Annette Peters ran away from her . But the 1,500 is her natural distance , and she knew if the pace was not killing , she could kick with anyone . // So Plumer , no fool , made the pace killing in the final on Sunday . Slaney ran lightly off her shoulder until the last back-stretch , where Regina Jacobs bolted past her . Then Suzy Hamilton passed Slaney off the curve . Jacobs won in 4:03.72 , followed by Plumer in 4:04.04 and Hamilton in 4:04.53 . Slaney was fourth in 4:05.43 . Uncrushed , Slaney said , " You do n't think this is the end , do you ? " She spoke of moving to the 10,000 and of her idea of nirvana : a year of going through training uninjured. // Plumer dedicated her race to Reynolds . Hamilton dedicated hers to her puppy , Otis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hopes in the men 's 1,500 lay in blunting the kicks of the likes of Terrence Herrington and NCAA champion Steve Holman . The 5 ' 10 " , 134-pound Spivey once was on the verge of greatness ; in 1986 he ran the mile in 3:49.80 . But at the ' 88 trials he was bumped twice on the last lap and narrowly missed third place . He also has had a mysterious glandular infection in his groin . A sore hip kept him out of last year 's world championships . Two months ago , while carrying his two-year-old son , Sebastian , Spivey tripped . Twisting to keep from falling on the child , he landed hard on his left hip and missed another two weeks of training . " He 's such a delicate little creature , " said Dr. David Martin , one of TAC 's medical directors . // And the 1,500 is hardly a race for the birdlike . After 200 meters , 3:49.31-miler Joe Falcon was tripped and spit out the back of the pack . He rolled up and gave chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He would never catch up , because the pace was fast , and when Spivey sensed it slowing , he took over with 700 meters to go . Holman and Herrington kept close , but at a price : Their kicks were draining away . Spivey cruised down the stretch to win in 3:36.24 , unconcerned that Holman had almost caught him , because he was celebrating as no other winner did , pounding his head on the track in prayer  --  " All I could say was ' Thank you , Lord , ' about 20 times "  --  and weeping in the arms of one of his coaches , Ken Popejoy . The strength of Spivey 's reaction meant that great emotions had been bottled up for far too long and that when he gets to Spain , he will be a man afire . // As will be 800-meter winner Johnny Gray , who has made two Olympic finals ( he was seventh in 1984 , fifth in ' 88 ) but approached neither of them in the condition he showed at these trials . Flowing past 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if no one else were on the track and won going away in 1:42.80 , the fastest time ever run on U.S. soil . One of Gray 's Santa Monica Track Club teammates , George Kersh , had looked safe for second because Mark Everett had dawdled 20 meters back in sixth with 200 to go and Jose Parrilla was behind Everett . " You have to know , " said Everett later , " that whatever Mark Everett is going to do is special . I let God use me as his instrument . " // On the wings of angels , Everett roared around the pack and reached second in 1:43.67 . Parrilla came with him and barely outleaned Kersh for the final spot , 1:43.97 to 1:44.00 . " I made the admission ticket worth it , " said Everett . " I ca n't wait to go back and look at the videotape. " // Michael Johnson approached the 200 final with Carl Lewis , among others , rather more solemnly . " Give Carl credit , " said Johnson just before taking it away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I expect a better race from Mike Marsh . " // Johnson drew Lane 8 , where he could neither see nor chase anyone until the stretch . " That upset me , " he said later , " but face it , in Lane 8 you run your own race . " Lewis would have traded . He was way inside , in Lane 2 , where the tightness of the turn taxes his long legs . Still , Lewis started well . // Johnson hit the stretch just ahead of Marsh and opened up strongly to win by a meter , 19.79 to 19.86 . Behind them , a picket line of desperate men hurled themselves at the line . The finish photo showed that former Arizona running back Michael Bates does n't have to report to the Seattle Seahawks ' training camp in July , because he 's an Olympian . He was third in 20.14 , inches ahead of Lewis 's 20.15. // Johnson was only .07 from Pietro Mennea 's world record of 19.72 , which was set at altitude . Since the New Orleans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ended and the Spanish moss began , Johnson had every right to crow , and to promise . " It 's only a matter of time , " he said . " Time and the right conditions . "
