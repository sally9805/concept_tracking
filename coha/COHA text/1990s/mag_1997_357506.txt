Thomas Carlyle , more than 1 1/2 centuries ago , wrote that " history is the essence of innumerable biographies . " Indeed , the literature of medicine introduces us to a cavalcade of colorful and intriguing characters , an assortment of personalities that prompted historian Fielding Garrison to remark that " all human life is there . " And yet , as distinctive as each of its many outstanding innovators has been , through the many ages and places in which their discoveries were made , there is a sturdy thread of tangible traits that unites them all . Even during the past four decades , which have witnessed medical innovation on an unprecedented scale , that sturdy thread has not frayed . Nor has the rapidity of achievement  --  with the linear progress of yesterday succumbing to exponential acceleration  --  stretched it to the breaking point . If anything , the new science and its bedside applications have provided more evidence than ever before that certain tangible human characteristics inevitably accompany innovation . <P> A year ago , a special issue of TIME highlighted some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 issue celebrates men and women who have contributed to those advances . Not all of the assemblage of healers presented here are doctors . Nurses , technical personnel and seekers of botanical remedies have also found the limelight . So has one committed American woman who donated her bone marrow to a desperately sick person whom she had never met . When she was asked what moved her to come forward , and how she could tolerate the weeks of soreness and fatigue that follow the marrow harvesting , her reply was unassuming . She did it , she says , because " there 's no choice . You 're talking about saving somebody 's life . " <P> Though she is not a healer by profession , the altruistic donor is imbued with the same stimulus , the same motivation , that has driven medical pioneers throughout history . The force that leads men and women to devote their lives to those who need help is their simple realization that , for them personally , there is no choice . More than a career , this has been their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve , the medical profession has always maintained as its ultimate mission the relief of human suffering . Though the greatest of medical innovators have made their most important contributions for any combination of personal and professional reasons , the background against which their motivations play has never changed . It remains what it has been since earliest s : the constant mindfulness that individual people are enduring the effects of disease and that only through the intervention of others can their problems be addressed . <P> Modern medicine has grown by means of a tradition that is almost 2,400 years old . Its practices are said to have begun on the Greek island of Cos , near the western coast of Asia Minor , where a school arose around the teachings of the legendary Hippocrates . Today the name of Hippocrates is mentioned most frequently in discussions of the oath attributed to him . But the Hippocratic physicians did far more than introduce the principles from which the codes of today 's medical ethics have developed .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
