Act One Scene One An old victorian house in the black section of Louisville Kentucky in February of 1971 . The inhabitants are four generations of a black family named Telfair . It is midnight . At curtain rise there is a single light burning stage right where BEN TELFAIR sits at a small table . He is a thirty-two year old black stonemason . Behind him and to the right is a high basement window and the soft blue light from a streetlamp . Outside in this light a softly falling snow . At far stage left is a podium or lectern at which Ben will speak his monologues throughout the play . It is important to note that the Ben we see onstage during the monologues is a double and to note that this double does not speak , but is only a figure designed to complete the scene . The purpose , as we shall see , is to give distance to the events and to place them in a completed past . The onstage double should nevertheless be as close to Ben in appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dressed identically . What must be kept in mind is that the performance consists of two delivers from the podium . And while it is true that Ben at his podium is at times speaking for  --  or through  --  his silent double on stage , it is nevertheless a crucial feature of the play that there be no suggestion of communication between these worlds . In this sense it would not even be incorrect to assume that Ben is unaware of the staged drama . Above all we must resist the temptation to see the drama as something being presented by the speaker at his lectern , for to do so is to defraud the drama of its right autonomy . One could say that the play is an artifact of history to which the audience is made privy , yet if the speaker at his podium apostrophizes the figures in that history it is only as they reside in his memory . It is this which dictates the use of the podium . It locates Ben in a separate space and isolates that space from the world of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which centers upon his own exoneration , his own salvation . The events which unfold upon the stage will not at all times support him . The audience may perhaps be also a jury . And now we can begin . As the mathematician Gauss said to his contemporaries . Go forward and faith will come to you . The podium is lit . Ben comes forward to take his place there . As he begins to speak , his double seated at the table onstage begins to write . BEN I always wanted to be like him . Even as a child . I was twelve when my grandmother died and then he came to this house and I began to see him every day and my mother would laugh at me because I had even begun to walk like him . And he was eighty-five years old . Lights come on in the kitchen of the house at stage center . Ben looks up from his desk toward the kitchen  --  which is upstairs . The kitchen represents the principal set of the play . It is an oldfashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow tongue-and-groove boards , a long kitchen table with chairs , a range , a sink , a refrigerator . An oldfashioned woodburning stove . At the rear are two doors , one leading outside and the other giving onto the bedroom of Ben 's grandfather , PAPAW . This door now opens and Papaw comes into the kitchen . He is 101 years old , small and wiry and fit . He goes to the sink andfills the kettle and puts it on the stove and goes to the woodstove and pokes up the fire . BEN He 's come into the kitchen to fix his tea . Sometimes I go up and we have tea together . Three oclock in the morning . Nothing surprises him . He has no schedule . Sometimes we talk and sometimes not . Sometimes we talk straight through till breakfast and Mama comes down and she looks at us but she does nt say anything . He does not need much sleep and I am like him in this also ...             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
