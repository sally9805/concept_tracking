No one believed a handshake on the White House lawn would turn Israel and the occupied territories into Eden . No one expected signatures on a document to satisfy extremists . No one thought a peace agreement would end all fear . But it was hoped that a peace agreement would bring something like peace . It has not , and as a result , Israelis and Palestinians alike are near despair over their famous accord signed in Washington less than two years ago . <P> A deep malaise has set in . Neither side has received what it bargained for in the agreement , which provided for a measure of Palestinian self-rule in preparation for talks beginning next year on the final status of the occupied territories . The Israelis expected relief from Palestinian fury but today find that violence is worse than before . The Palestinians wanted real control over their own lives but today find them as dominated by Israel as ever . Pollsters of both sides in recent weeks report that an increasing majority no longer support the peace accord . <P> The pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years of the uprising , or intifadeh , that preceded the agreement , Palestinians killed 161 Israelis ; in the 20 months since the agreement was signed , the toll is 123 dead . Most were victims of suicide bombings carried out by Muslim extremists . " You get the feeling we 're collectively going over a cliff , " says student Sarah Halevi . " I completely do n't trust anything the Palestinians say . " Seeing the killers celebrated in the streets of Gaza , and how gingerly Yasser Arafat 's governing Palestinian Authority has treated them ( at least until very recently ) , most Israelis wonder whether it is possible ever to make peace . Even among Israeli peace activists , says Clinton Bailey , a history professor at Tel Aviv University , " people are asking whether making the deal with Arafat was the right thing to do . " <P> It is hard to find anyone who believes strongly that the limited self-rule now in effect in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho will soon be expanded to the include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen at all . Israelis are worried about creating new safe havens for bombers . As Uri Dromi , the director of Israel 's Government Press Office , says , " People see what 's happening in Gaza , and they say , ' You mean to tell me you want to bring this closer to our homes ? ' " <P> A poll conducted in late April found that only 45% of Israelis still favored the peace accord . At the time it was signed , 61% favored it . Other recent polls show Israelis consistently preferring Benjamin Netanyahu , leader of the opposition Likud Party , over Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin . Netanyahu is harshly critical of the peace agreement and has said he considers it a dead letter because of Palestinian violations . Most Palestinians  --  69% by one survey  --  approved of the agreement when it was made . Now only 40% report satisfaction with it , according to a poll released last week by the Jerusalem Media and Communications Center . Forty percent said the agreement was insufficient , and an additional 16% said it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strip there is no debate at all that things are worse under autonomy , " says the center 's director , Ghassan Khatib.
