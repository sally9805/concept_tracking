" The news that I had AIDS hit me hard , but did not knock me down , " wrote Arthur Ashe in his moving autobiography , Days of Grace , to be published this week by Alfred A. Knopf , Inc . " Yes , I felt pain , but experience as an athlete had taught me that in times of danger I had to respond with confidence , authority and grace . " The book , completed just three days before his death , at 49 , last February , is a testament to those virtues , which the tennis legend displayed so frequently both on and off the court . Ashe , whose competitive career was cut short following a heart attack in 1979 , was a veteran of adversity . " Living with AIDS is not the greatest burden I 've had in my life , " he said last summer . " Being black is . " The first African-American to win both the U.S. Open ( 1968 ) and Wimbledon ( 1975 ) , Ashe continued to speak out against social injustice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his memoir , as if it were simply another adversary to face with dignity , if not to defeat . " Despair is a state of mind , " he observed , " to which I refuse to surrender . " The following excerpt from Days of Grace , written with Princeton professor of literature Arnold Rampersad , begins when Ashe was troubled by the first symptoms of the dread disease that would claim his life . " Jeanne , " I said . " something is wrong with me . " It was a beautiful late summer morning in 1988 . We were in our suit at the Sagamore Resort on Lake George , N.Y . Our daughter , Camera , who was a year-and-a-half old , was with us . " My fingers . I ca n't get them to work well . " " Maybe they are numb because you slept on them ? " " No , I can feel them . I just do n't seem to be able to use them . " Neither of us was alarmed . We had both been through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unresponsive finger did not seem like much to be concerned about . Frankly , I expected to go to sleep that night and awake to find my fingers back to normal . However , by the time we checked out of the Sagamore a few days later , my right hand was hanging from the wrist , almost completely limp . I telephoned my internist , Dr. William Russell , who asked me to come the next day , Friday , Aug. 26 . The sight of my hand , as limp as a flag on a still day , made him sit up . Listening carefully to my complaints , Dr. Russell looked closely at the hand and said , " I am going to arrange for you to have a CAT scan of your brain right away . " The last time I heard a doctor speak to me with such a sense of urgency was July 31 , 1979 , when Dr. Lee Wallace , playing tennis on a court near my own , suspected that I was having a heart attack and insisted that I go straightaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20-minute procedure , I joined Dr. Russell and a radiologist to view the X-ray images . I saw that the two hemispheres of my brain , which should have been virtually identical , were not . The left side bore a splotch . Was it a stroke ? A small one now , but the precursor of a massive one that might leave me unable to care for myself ? Was it cancer of the brain  --  inoperable ? Would I face months of extreme pain and then certain death ? Or would an aneurysm snuff out my life in a second ? Around 3:30 p.m. that day , carrying the CAT scan images and trying to remain calm , I entered the office of Dr. John Caronna , a neurologist at New York Hospital . " Something is in there . We can see that , " he said . " But what ? I do n't think we can know for certain without a biopsy . " On Wednesday , Aug. 31 , I checked into New York Hospital for a fresh battery of tests , including a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results came back . My wife , Jeanne , and my physician friends Doug Stein and Eddie Mandeville were with me when I heard the bad news . In fact , they had been told and gave it to me . I was HIV positive . " What does this mean about Jeanne ? " I asked . She reached out and squeezed my hand . " You and me , babe , " she said . " You and me . " She herself had yet to be tested for HIV . The most recent medical data have shown that the virus stays dormant for about five years after infecting someone , then surfaces in the form of an infection . A brain operation would ascertain if I had such an infection . The results of the 4.5-minute operation on Sept. 8 indicated that he had toxoplasmosis , a parasitic infection that is a marker for AIDS . I remember Jeanne taking my hand and squeezing it as if she would never let go , just as she had done when I heard the HIV news . Not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aha , " I said , almost casually  --  or so Jeanne tells me . " That 's that . " There was nothing I could possibly do . I had to make the best of the situation . If that attitude sounds almost inhuman , at best stoical , I can respond only that this is my way of dealing with adversity . I was n't frightened or nervous , and I did n't lose any sleep that night . How had I become infected ? I was not and have never been a drug user . I also know that I can look anyone in the eye and say two things about my sex life : In almost 16 years of marriage , I have never been unfaithful , and I have never had a homosexual experience . The facts of the case were simple . Recovering from double-bypass heart surgery in 1983 , I had felt miserable . After I complained , a doctor laid out my options . " You can wait it out , Arthur , and you 'll feel better after a while , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of units of blood . " " I would like the blood , " I replied . I do n't think I hesitated for a moment . Surely there was nothing to be feared from the blood bank of a major American hospital . In fact , less than a month later , in July 1983 , Margaret Heckler , President Reagan 's Secretary of Health and Human Services , confidently made an announcement : " The nation 's blood supply is safe . " It was not until March 1985 that the government put a test in place to detect the presence of HIV in the nation 's blood supply . I can not say that even the news that I had AIDS devastated me , or drove me into bitter reflection even for a short time . I have been able to stay calm in part because my heart condition is a sufficient source of danger if I am going to be terrified by illness . My first heart attack could have ended my life in a few chest-ravaging seconds . Because I have been through battles with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I was not always that way . I had been a sickly child , but for most of the first 36 years of my life , or until 1979 , I had nurtured a sense of myself as indestructible . For the nine years since my first heart attack , however , I had been living with a powerful sense of my own mortality . What would have devastated me was to discover that I had infected my wife , Jeanne , and my daughter , Camera . The thought that this beautiful child , not yet 2 years old , who has brought more pure joy into our lives than we had ever known before we laid eyes on her , could be infected with this horrible disease , because of me , was almost too much even to think about . Both Jeanne and Camera were quickly tested . Both , thank God , were found to be free of any trace of HIV . As I approached the summer of 1991 , a sense of anxious expectation mounted . Could I make it to Camera 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What about my 15th wedding anniversary , on Feb. 20 , 1992 ? Jeanne and I celebrated . And then came Wimbledon , in June . I was there . By the time Ashe appeared at Wimbledon as a commentator for HBO last summer , the news that he had been infected with the AIDS virus had made international headlines . Two months earlier , he had been forced to call a press conference about his health after he became aware of a story in the works at USA Today reporting rumors that he was HIV positive . For nearly four years Ashe had kept his condition a secret from all but a trusted circle of physicians , friends and family members . Going public was an agonizing decision for such a private man . After my AIDS announcement , I was angry for several days . But when Jeanne and I had to tell Camera of my illness , I swallowed my feelings . " Precious , " I said that evening , when Jeanne and I decided the time had come , " have you noticed anything unusual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she replied . " They keep ringing all the time . " " Yes . They 're ringing because Daddy had to go on television and tell everybody that he is sick , that he has AIDS . " " What 's AIDS ? " she asked , looking at me now . " Is it like when you have diarrhea ? When you do n't feel well in the morning ? Is that AIDS ? " Her instincts surprised Jeanne and me ; she knew more , had noticed more than we ever suspected . Five years old , she could understand only a small part of what we said , but we talked as best we could about the illness . We also tried to prepare her for the taunts of other children . " Camera , what are you going to say to anybody who tells you your Daddy has AIDS ? " " What should I say ? " she asked . " Just say , " Oh , I know that . ' ' " We hoped this simple reply would stop the teasing . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor could tell me how much time I had left . Already , in fact , the medical community saw me as a long-term survivor . However , I could not ignore the fact that AIDS , as well as heart disease , was exacting a heavy toll on my body . My weight was just over 140 pounds . ( In my playing days , I weighed just over 150 . ) My stamina , too , was impaired . I had no time to waste . In addition to all my public appearances , I kept as busy as ever on my various business interests throughout the year following my announcement . I travel a great deal , sometimes flying three times or even more in a single week . But I seldom stay away more than a night from my family . I can not bear to be away so long from Jeanne and Camera . I love getting Camera ready for school in the morning or helping her go to sleep at night . I love the pleasure she finds in our outings as a family  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out together , just the two of us . She gives me so many reasons to want to live . The year 1993 did not start well . In fact , New Year 's Day found me hurting , coughing and feverish , on an airplane bringing my family back a day early from Miami . I had gone to Florida to teach my annual Christmas tennis clinic at the Doral Resort &; Country Club . While playing a round of golf I developed a persistent cough . My AIDS physician in Miami ordered a chest X-ray that revealed nothing out of the ordinary . On New Year 's Eve morning , the mere act of drawing air into my lungs was causing pain . I could not take any deep breaths . At 5 the next morning , I awoke with a start . I was on fire , burning up . I took my temperature : 101.9 degrees . With the aid of nothing more exotic than extra-strength Tylenol , I brought down my temperature and relieved the other symptoms sufficiently to fly back to New York where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibiotic , Azithromycin , had no effect , I saw a pulmonary specialist . That is how I found out I was suffering from the dreaded PCP , or pneumocystis carinii pneumonia . PCP is the major killer of patients suffering from AIDS . Fortunately , my infectious disease specialist , Dr. Henry F. Murray , assured me that my case was not particularly serious . I would definitely survive this bout . Eight years ago , I probably would have been dead by this time . His words encouraged me , but I was still miserable . Sweaty with fever and chills , coughing and shivering , I lay under my blankets , feeling drained and depressed . At New York Hospital I was assigned to a room named after the late Greek shipping magnate Stavros Niarchos . Undoubtedly , it was the most luxurious hospital room I had ever had , and I have had quite a few . Apart from an intravenous feeding stand parked discreetly in a corner , my iron bed was perhaps the sole reminder that I was in a hospital . The floors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furniture would hardly disgrace the living room of a fine house . Dr. David E. Rogers , one of the hospital 's most eminent teaching physicians , stopped by to see me one morning . " A beautiful room , " he said . " I had a patient in here once . John F. Kennedy , no less . " There , as I kept company with the spirit of John Kennedy , I knew that what matters are the consolations of life . What else do you have to sustain you in the dark hours ? I remember one evening with Jeanne and Camera in Eleuthera , the Bahamas . We were under the stars , the hour was late , and Camera was still up , but what did we care ? She was happy after a day in the sun , and now she was dancing to a calypso band with a little friend she had just met . Jeanne was happy too , talking easily to the wife of a musician she had met earlier in our stay . As I sat in an armchair watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with life , a wave of emotion washed over me , and I started to cry . I cried quietly , but Jeanne turned and saw me . The smile left her face , but then it quickly returned . She knew that I was crying not out of sorrow but of joy , and that the joy was so powerful it hurt . My joy was that I was there , on that beach under those stars watching the two people I loved more than anyone or anything in the world , and I did not want that feeling of perfect joy ever to end . Often , people inquire whether I ever ask myself , " Why me ? " I never do . If I ask , " Why me ? " as I am assaulted by heart disease and AIDS , I must also ask , " Why me ? " about my blessings . The morning after I won Wimbledon I should have asked , " Why me ? " and doubted that I deserved the victory . I also do not waste time pleading with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not to be invoked to ask God for things for oneself or even for others . Rather , prayer is a medium through which I ask God to show me God 's will , and to give me strength to carry out that will . I do not brood on the prospect of dying soon . I am not afraid of death . Perhaps fear will come to haunt me when the moment is closer . I think of my lack of fear as being , in some ways , different from true courage . My bouts of surgery have made me a veteran in fighting death . Familiarity has not bred contempt of death but has given me practice in learning to face it calmly . I think that we must do our best to face death with dignity . I hope that I can be strong when my time comes . <p>
