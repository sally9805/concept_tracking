The VIRTUAL MC comes up on the screen , disembodied , and grinning in the light. p. 61 VIRTUAL MC Well , my little sluts , it looks like our dancing daughter has taken flight . Angels bring her rest while we change places on a wooden bench and take our crystal high . If it 's not one brutality , it 's another , and the way we count the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , crashers , shine for all eternity with your Paul Smith trousers and Miu Miu shoes . This is an alcohol-free night . Do you hear me ? No tequila , no martinis , no retro hangovers . But we got lollipops for those tired tongues and buzzing teeth to last us through the next hundred tomorrows that Louis Prima wo n't let us live down in the swing of the mood of the many thousand things that strikes his chord . You get me , dolls ? This is about pig tails and ankle socks and setting yourself up for burying your heads between your knees . There is no tomorrow , children . There is only the night . And we 're going to live it through for eternity . The VIRTUAL MC 's grin escapes the image of ACHILLES , live , who nevertheless seems to be ghosting a corner of the ever expanding space . He sings . " My eyes to your eyes " ACHILLES Insomnia trace my skin to you . My eyes to your eyes , My eyes to your eyes . Save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hold your breath , dear angel And I will follow .

They grow out of my shoulder blades Out of the veil of the TV screen . I am not cut , but I am bleeding . Crash . I remember falling , Kissing Through the garden , To the neon lights on the street , Splitting me into threads of skin . Wings lift me . I am moving . I am at the edge of the city . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green . Boys , girls and a million vacant eyes . Look at me . I stand on the metal ledge . Black liquid sand slipping off my skin . The story has been told again . A wreath has been placed upon Iphigenia 's head . Crash . Every part of me is breaking . But I 'm all right . Give me your hands . Give me your hands , Cause you 're wonderful . ( END OF PLAY. )
