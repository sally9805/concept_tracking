Angela Baldwin and her son Tyrece , 6 , are in the waiting room of Lincoln Community Health Center . They have come for Tyrece 's school physical exam and immunizations . In Durham only six months , Baldwin is glad to have Lincoln Community in her neighborhood . " We did n't know where to take Tyrece , " she says . " We happened to drive by the center one day , and so we came here . They took us right in . " <P> Duke Med is grateful too . It is affiliated with the center , which is only a few miles from its main hospital , and much prefers to handle such routine checkups here rather than in its own high-priced facilities . Lincoln Community is one of dozens of affiliations and joint ventures that Duke has with local medical facilities spread throughout the 27-county region targeted as its turf . Serving 29,000 registered patients , who made 102,000 visits last year , Lincoln is a gleaming example of Duke 's community outreach at work . <P> Not always is a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , when Duke announced plans to acquire Durham Regional Hospital and nearby Raleigh Community Hospital , many in the area were suspicious of its motives . They feared , not without cause , that Duke was trying to take complete control of health care in the region by buying up all the competition . A major worry was that Duke would then jack up prices , as any monopoly would . <P> At the first public hearing on the Duke-Durham Regional merger , held in a black church , city councilman Howard Clement , an African American , voiced a widely shared concern when he stood up and asked , " Can we trust Duke ? " It was , and is , the big question , Clement believes , " and the jury is still out . " <P> For people of color in Durham , Duke is more than just the hospital ; it is " a white university hidebound by Southern tradition , " as Clement puts it . Like most members of the town 's minority community , Clement never wanted to go to Duke Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experimented on you . " In 1968 , when he was badly bruised in a head-on car collision , Clement screamed at the ambulance driver , " Do n't take me to Duke ! I do n't want to go to Duke ! " <P> Terry Sanford , Duke University 's president from 1969 to 1982 , tried to build bridges between town and gown . He was the first Duke president to go to city hall , and on Sunday mornings he brought people from Durham to the campus for breakfast meetings . Duke 's current president , Nan Keohane , has reached out even further . Since arriving in 1993 , she has opened a Duke University office in downtown Durham and helped establish clinics in five city schools . Although the public University of North Carolina receives the bulk of government funding for indigent care in the city , Duke and Durham Regional Hospital together provide 90% of that care . " I do n't think they 've always gotten the credit for what they do in the community , " says Dr. Evelyn D. Schmidt , executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
