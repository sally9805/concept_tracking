<p> The $300 TV that ends up costing $1,200 , and othe rip-offs of the rent-to-own industry <p> Just $14.99 a week for a color television sounds pretty good to a $6-an-hour factory worker or a mother on welfare . For people without the cash or the squeaky-clean credit history to buy it at Sears , " renting to own " offers an alluring alternative : easy payments , no credit check , and no hassles . But your mother should have told you this : When you hear phrases like " no credit check and no hassles , " keep your hand on your wallet . Someone 's trying to pick your pocket . <p> The rent-to-own equation is simple . When a rent-to-own store brings in a new piece of merchandise , it multiplies the wholesale price by a set percentage  --  usually 350 percent to 450 percent  --  to come up with the total sales price . Then the store divides that total by a number of weeks or months  --  typically 78 weeks or 18 months  --  to determine what the installment payments will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other submerged costs , and eventually customers pay three , four , or five times what they 'd spend on the same item at a retail store . That 's why a 20-inch TV that costs $329.99 at Sears will cost as much as $1,200 , at Rent-A-Center , the nation 's largest chain of rent-to-own outlets . <p> With these exorbitant prices come a set of rules that grossly favor the retailer over the customer . Iris Green , a public housing resident in Paterson , N.J. , paid nearly $4,000 to Continental Rentals toward a stereo , washer , freezer , and other items that had a cash value of less than $2,800 . Then she got sick and the paychecks from her job as a nursing home aide stopped coming . Continental came and took everything . Sandra James signed a $2,485 rent-to-own contract for bedroom furniture from a Rent-A-Center in Chicago . She fell behind in her payments and the store swore out a theft charge against her . She says the manager told her the warrant would be dropped if she paid $177.50 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police officers accompanied by the manager . She spent the night in jail . <p> Rent-to-own got its start back in the sixties , when state and federal governments were passing laws to control ghetto merchants who used retail installment contracts to fleece the poor . The industry 's trade group , the Association of Progressive Rental Organizations ( APRO ) , says the rent-toown industry was born during this time " as a result of the tightening of consumer credit and burgeoning federal consumer protection legislation . " <p> Rent-to-own stores have managed to avoid tough consumer laws by tinkering with the traditional retail credit contract . Mainly , it 's a matter of changing the terminology . An interest charge becomes a " rental fee . " A late charge becomes a " reinstatement fee . " Merchandise that is repossessed is " returned by the customer . " Buying an item is " exercising a purchase option . " <p> For customers , the only advantage to this system is that if they ca n't afford to keep paying , the item can be brought back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments . That 's a nice option for anyone whose income is unreliable . But it 's not much of a consolation for somebody like Iris Green , who 's already invested thousands of dollars in the merchandise . It 's been enough in most states , however , to get rent-to-own exempted from retailcredit laws which generally limit store owners to interest rates of 20 to 30 percent a year . By avoiding such regulation , rent-to-own dealers can charge the equivalent of interest rates of 100 , 200 , even 300 percent a year . <p> In the past three decades , rent-to-own has grown from a handful of inner-city operators one step ahead of the law to a powerful nationwide industry with 7,500 stores and revenues over $3.5 billion annually . It 's dominated by a few conglomerate-owned , upscale-looking chains that have changed the look , if not the reality , of selling to the poor . <p> In spite of the industry 's new image , it continues to spend a lot of money defending itself against lawsuits from attorneys for the poor . ( At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first question from the audience was : " What can we do to abolish Legal Aid ? " ) The litigation has occasionally taught the industry something about the consequences of heavy-handed collection tactics . But the lawsuits have had less success in changing the pricing equation that makes every customer a victim . The industry has beaten back almost all challenges with a two pronged strategy . First , overwhelm understaffed Legal Aid offices with private bar talent ( or buy off destitute customers with modest confidential settlements ) . Then , work to change the laws . <p> In most states , industry lobbyists have prevailed by combining free-market rhetoric and hard-ball politicking . Back in 1983 , Jeanne Fanner , a North Carolina state legislator , introduced a bill that would have limited finance charges on rent-to-own contracts . Pro-business lawmakers gutted the bill and then the industry took revenge on Fenner . During her next two campaigns , rent-to-own dealers from as far away as Texas poured more than $20,000 into her opponents ' campaigns . Fenner , who spent a fraction of that , lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina have gotten nowhere . <p> In many other states , the industry has headed off such nasty fights by using an effective strategy of preemptive regulation . It works like this : Dealers approach a legislator with a reputation as a consumer advocate and say , " We want to be regulated so we can protect our customers from the handful of bad apples out there . We 've written a law that will do the trick . " <p> The industry 's model statute sounds good . And no doubt it does help run off sonic of the most outrageous scam artists because it includes some protections for consumers , like requiring that stores be honest about their prices and state whether an item is new or used . But the law also exempts rent-to-own deals from state retail credit laws and the interest limits that go along with them . " Disclose and Anything Goes , " Legal Aid attorneys call this strategy . Since 1984 , at least 35 states have passed such rent-to-own friendly statutes . <p> The industry  --  which by the late 1980s was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  has even persuaded the Council of State Governments to endorse its model bill . And it seemed ready to palm off the same statute on Congress until Texas Rep. Henry Gonzalez was joined on his House Banking , Finance , and Urban Affairs committee by a number of newly elected urban liberals . <p> What explains this history of legislative successes ? Good public relations is much of it . The industry has convinced more than a few powerful people of what might generously be called half truths : <p> We ' re just a bunch of family owned stores . Too much regulation would put us out of business . <p> In written testimony submitted to Gonzalez 's committee this spring , the executive director of the industry 's trade association declared that " Eighty percent of the industry is made up of ' mom and pop ' operators with fewer than five stores each . " Later , during his oral testimony , he changed that figure to " over two-thirds . " <p> Even that 's wrong . Rent-A-Center , the Wichita-based chain owned by Thorn EMI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garth Brooks , controls 1,200 of the industry 's 7,500 or so stores . That 's nearly 20 percent of the market all by itself . In fact , in written answers to questions from the House committee , the trade association 's own figures indicate that 40 percent of rent-to-own stores are owned or franchised by chains with 25 or more outlets . David Ramp , a Minneapolis Legal Aid attorney who has been fighting the industry for years , says his research shows that 60 percent of the market is controlled by fewer than 20 large corporations . And the industry trend is toward more and more consolidation . <p> We do n't prey on the poor . Our customers come from all walks of life . <p> Anecdotal evidence aside , it 's clear that the vast bulk of rent-town 's customer base comes from the poor or nearpoor . For example , Rent-A-Center 's own market research has shown that nearly 60 percent of its customers earn less than $20,000 a year , while just 4 percent earn $45,000 or more . Only about 7 percent are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not retail . Just 25 percent of our customers end up owning . Most bring back their merchandise after a few weeks . <p> This is the industry 's big lie . " We 're in the retail merchandising business when you get right down to it , " Larry Sutton , an owner in a Florida rent-to-own chain , told fellow dealers at a 1991 seminar . " We do n't want to say that in court . But let 's face it : We 're in the retail business . We sell . " Indeed , in a national survey , 70 percent of Rent-A-Center customers said they intended to own the merchandise . Just 11 percent said they only wanted a short-term lease . In fact , 48 percent believed they already owned the goods even before the " lease " was completed . <p> To test what they do tell consumers , I visited 15 rent-to-own stores in Georgia , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and Virginia . I asked questions just like any customer off the street . Among them : What percentage of customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 percent figure that 's cited in official settings . Seven estimated 80 percent or more . Six others gave estimates ranging from 45 percent to 70 percent . At another store , a salesman said simply : " Almost all of them . " <p> We charge more because of the high costs of theft and because we offer free repairs . <p> In congressional testimony this spring , the industry 's trade group said that 12 percent of rent-to-own merchandise is stolen . However , the industry association 's chief attorney wrote in an 1989 trade journal article that rent-to-own stores ' losses from stolen merchandise consistently averages about 2 percent of revenues  --  considerably less than what credit-card companies are forced to write off in unpaid debts . <p> As for free repairs and replacement , a lot of the stuff  --  such as furniture  --  requires little maintenance , and much of it is covered by manufacturer 's warranties . A Rent-A-Center study found that less than five percent of their merchandise needed repairs . <p> But the spectre of damaged goods is actually a cash cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " damage and theft waiver fees " - essentially credit insurance that covers the store if something happens to the merchandise . In return for the fee , you wo n't owe anything to the store if the merchandise is damaged or stolen during the contract period . The downside , of course , is that you 're also out all the payments you 've already made and ca n't keep what you 've been paying for . <p> Typically , a rent-to-own store will charge you $1 a week in " waiver " fees for insurance-so that a $330 TV from Rent-A-Center ( for which you 're paying $1,200 ) costs another $74 to insure . For roughly that sum you could buy enough renter 's insurance to cover $10,000 or even $20,000 worth of personal belongings . Rent-A-Center , meanwhile , makes a bundle on the extra fee : Ramp 's research has shown that Rent-A-Center has to write off only about a nickel in claims for each dollar it takes in " waiver fees . " ( Another big money maker is fees to forgive late payments . Rent-A-Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charges over one four-year period ) . <p> Even where lawmakers have n't been snookered into buying this industry propaganda , rent-to-own dealers have found ways to get around the law . When Pennsylvania passed a statute in 1989 that defined rent-to-own as a retail sale and sets an annual interest limit of 18 percent , the state 's rent-to-own dealers claimed the law would put them out of business . It did n't . Instead , most ignored it or found ways to skirt it . Some , for example , now offer straight rentals ( " rent-to-rent " ) with the promise of a " rebate " that the customer can use to purchase the item at the end of the contract . An undercover investigation by the Pennsylvania attorney general 's office found rent-to-own stores were still charging annual interest rates from 82 to 265 percent . <p> This end run shows the problem with trying to regulate away price-gouging : As long as there 's a consumer demand and a market that is locked out of mainstream credit , some businesses will find a way to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you gon na go if you ca n't get credit ? " asks Tonya Cross , a rent-to-own customer in Roanoke , Va . " If you want it , you 're gon na have to get it from somewhere . " <p> Which is where consumer advocates come in . Many customers are illiterate or financially unsophisticated and have little idea that they are paying double or triple retail , or more . Few know that  --  as the industry has sworn in court and in Congress  --  you have only a one-in-four chance of ultimately keeping the stuff when you rent-to-own . A consumer protection campaign pushing these themes would be a good start . <p> Other customers , like Cross , know that they 're paying more , but go the rent-to-own route because they believe they have no other choices . That 's why government and consumer activists should provide them with some cheaper alternatives by putting more resources into credit unions and other non-profit institutions that offer savings accounts and small loans to poor and working people . <p> In the meantime , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on time from retail stores or with credit cards is almost always cheaper than renting to own . Paying 20 percent interest a year or more to a retail store is n't cheap , but it 's less than rent-to-own and the chances you 'll actually keep the goods are better . Taking the plunge with Sears simply has to be better than paying $1,200 for a $300 TV . <p> by Mike Hudson <p> <p> Mike Hudson is a reporter with the Roanoke ( Va . ) Times &; World-News .
