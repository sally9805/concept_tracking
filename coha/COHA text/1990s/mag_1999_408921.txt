The Pope inspired last month 's crucial meeting with dissidents . Photograph Thousands of Cubans celebrated the feast of the country 's patroness , Our Lady of Charity , with a procession through the streets of Havana in September 1999. // CUBAN DISSIDENTs-believers in freedom and respect for human rights on their island-became fi:dly legitimized for the first time in the 41 - year history of Fidel Castro 's revolution through an extraordinary sequence of events in mid-November that marked a major milestone in Cuba 's political evolution . Strangely enough , it was Castro himself , not through fault or merit of his own , and certainly to his lasting regret , who helped to legitimize his foes . But the fundamental process had been largely set in motion by Pope John Paul 11 , when during his visit to Cuba nearly two years ago he proclaimed in Havana that " Cuba must open to the world and the world must open to Cuba . " It was one of those great phrases that serve to redefine the history of nations . The events last month , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Brazil and Panama , and a halfdozen Latin American foreign ministers met with the dissidents in an unprecedented fashion , demonstrated how Castro as well as the Clinton administration had underestimated the pope 's long-range political vision and his keen sense of diplomacy . Indeed , almost everybody , again including Castro and the United States , had likewise underestimated the potentially crucial role of the Cuban church , energized and emboldened by John Paul II . The conventional wisdom was that Cuba was not the pope 's native and intensely Catholic Poland , and therefore could not qualify for a repeat papal anti-Communist performance . Analysts and policymakers erred , moreover , in assuming that if basic change in Cuba ( that is , the disappearance of Castro ) failed to occur within months of the papal visit , John Paul It 's journey would have been politically in vainstrengthening and legitimizing the dictator instead . This foolishness was abundantly shared by the administration in Washington , which continues to fail to comprehend both history and current reality . The pope , on the other hand , appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words to Cardinal Jaime Ortega Alamino , archbishop of Havana , were , " No triumphalisms , please ! " This was to guarantee that the church would proceed with deliberate speed and take care to avoid playing into Castro 's hands in the context of the nascent political process in Cuba . Patience , as they say in Rome , is a cardinal virtue , and John Paul II wished to make sure that the Cuban cardinal and his bishops would exercise it . And this patience began to be rewarded in November , when the evolutionary process became slowly but fully engaged , even though a segment of the Cuban church , led by the archbishop of Santiago and the bishops of eastern Cuba ( where Castro 's revolution was born in 1953 ) , favors a full-steam-ahead approach . Such an approach naturally complicates the extremely delicate position of Cardinal Ortega , who at least for now must be all things to all Cuban men and women-from Castro to the Fidel-hating exiles in Miami . Nevertheless , this is part of the new dynamics of the church in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if there exists a parallel between John Paul 11 's strategy in Poland and in Cuba , it is to be found in the papal concept that positive solutions stem from negotiation and not confrontation , and that bloodshed is to be averted at almost any cost . This is why the pope dealt simultaneously , from the outset , with the Polish authorities and the Polish church , and this is why in Cuba he dealt with both Castro and Ortega while remaining in constant contact with the latter . His Cuban visit , prepared for by secret negotiations for over 10 years , had been very well thought out by the highly pragmatic pontiff . But let us turn now to how , in effect , John Paul II paved the way for legitimizing the Cuban dissidents . It is a delicious story that ought to be taught at foreign-affairs schools everywhere , and it provides a lesson on how a dictator can be hoist by his own petard . The pope , who has a way with words and the ideas behind them , triggered the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . His belief was that a peaceful change can occur only when Cuba is no longer isolated from the outside-economically and diplomatically , as in the case of the totally unproductive 37-year-old U.S. embargo and through unfriendly attitudes of fellow Latin American governments  --  and from the inside by the control walls erected by the Castro regime . John Paul 11 reasoned that the Latin Americans can have a pro-democratic influence in Cuba at this juncture . Thus the first test of the papal analysis was the annual Ibero-American summit that Cuba had been scheduled to host in its turn in November 1999 . Castro had attended several such summits in Latin American capitals in past years , but it led to no noticeable results . He was mum when democracy and human rights were being discussed , and his own rhetorical contributions were predictably worn-out revolutionary banalities . This year 's Havana summit , however , was intended to glorify and truly legitimize the Castro oeuvre in the eyes of the world , what with the attendance by most Latin American presidents , the king and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Fidelista Cuba ) and the president of Portugal . For Castro , summit preparations were the year 's overwhelming priority . Enormous resources were devoted to creating an amiable image of Cuba for the distinguished visitors . Then funny things began to happen on the way to the summit-most of them of Castro 's own doing , the Supreme Leader having himself evidently underestimated the changes already taking place at home as well as abroad in relation to Cuba . John Paul il 's exhortations and quiet policies were significant elements in these changes . They unquestionably helped to give some cohesion to Cuba 's heretofore pathetically weak , small , divided and unorganized dissident groups . The pope had been convinced all along that the church , acting discreetly but effectively and without provoking the regime , could sooner or later play a constructive leadership role in the political vacuum that the Cuban Communist Party no longer filled . He is gradually being proven right . Curiously , it was Castro who actually overestimated the dissidence before the summit , because he had learned from his own revolutionary experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be tolerated by those in power . Overestimating , however , can be as perilous as underestimating . In any case , this set the tone for subsequent developments in which Castro , rather atypically , reacted in contradictory ways . On the one hand , for the past four years Castro had allowed the Diocese of Pinar del Rio , in western Cuba , to publish a handsomely printed bimonthly magazine named Vitral . It has a circulation of about 30,000 and an editor , Dagoberto Valdes Hernandez , who has been demanding in elegant but finn editorials greater social justice and national reconciliation of all Cubans . On the other hand , Castro chose to stage early this year a trial of four dissident intellectuals that nearly torpedoed the Havana summit because of its loud international repercussions . Since their arrest in 1998 , the four have by now spent nearly 600 days in prison . They have been charged with counter-revolutionary activities because they circulated a manifesto claiming that " the nation belongs to all . " This was read to mean that the Communist Party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being arrested , released , rearrested , harassed and even beaten in the streets by the regime 's gangs of toughs known as Rapid Response Brigades . As the government moved apace with summit preparations throughout 1999 , the Cuban church and church-linked groups and individuals engaged in preparations of their own . Dagoberto Valdes , who is a member of the Pontifical Council on justice and Peace , the Vatican body dedicated to human rights worldwide , published a lengthy editorial in Vitral urging Ibero-American leaders to attend the summit-but on a number of conditions . The summit must include , Valdes wrote , " the defense in Cuba of principles and rights " that the participants " defend and desire in their own countries . " There should be a commitment that Cuba would not be used as an example of " the dream of a social justice undertaking , " because that dream " had ended . " To maintain the dream , he added , " it must be reinvented through real channels of freedom and solidarity . " In plain Spanish , this meant that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fighting words in today 's Cuba , but the island 's shattered economy is a reality after 40 years of the Sovietsubsidized revolution . Late in September of this year , a conference of the bishops of four dioceses in eastern Cuba , directed by the fiery archbishop of Santiago , Pedro Claro Meurice Estiu , who is chairman of the Cuban chapter of the justice and Peace Council , issued a ringing document not only denouncing the Communist system and its repression of dissidence , but also denouncing the Cuban church 's top hierarchy for its " passivity in the face of a totalitarian system . " In language never before heard in Cuba , the eastern bishops declared their concern about " the silence of our church in the face of the new repressive laws and the fate of the four dissidents who had drafted the " Nation Belongs to All " " document . In October the Rev. Jorge Palma urged Cubans in his homily during a Mass at the shrine of Our Lady of Cobre , the patroness of Cuba , to " put aside their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom . " It was reminiscent of the words of Polish dissidents in the mid-1970 's : " We have decided not to be afraid . " And , of course , it was reminiscent of John Paul I 's own exclamation at the start of his pontificate : " Do not be afraid ! " With the November summit approaching , the regime reacted with fury . Castro went on television for five hours and held an eight-hour press conference for foreign correspondents to charge that the Cuban church was financed by the United States and the Miami exiles to derail the summit . He also stunned his audience by reading the names of all the dissident leaders , names that , with a few exceptions , were unknown to a vast majority of Cubans . The church 's response came from Cardinal Ortega , still performing his high-wire political act , who pointed out that the church had rejected " manipulations " by Miami-ii , but also by " those who , during the flowering of the socalled Theology of Liberation and of " Christians for Socialism , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dividing the Latin American church . " Ortega again called for " forgiveness and reconciliation , " emphasizing in a special pastoral letter that " changes in the political and social fields are not needed as a prior condition for this action . " It was against this confusing background that the IberoAmerican summit opened in Havana on Nov. 15 . In the spirit of John Paul II 's appeal for Cuba and the world to " open , " it turned into a two-day affair revolving around the attending statesmen 's meetings with the dissidents . The accent throughout was on human rights . The visitors had requested the meetings beforehand-it had never happened before-and Castro clearly had no choice but to agree ; the alternative was to refuse , which would embarrass him to an unacceptable degree . In short , he was trapped . Photograph Young parishioners wait outside a door marked with parish office hours at Maria Aux iliadlora Church in Havana , Cuba . // The summit issued a " Declaration of Havana , " but all the attention was centered on the dissidents : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paya , a Christian Liberation Movement activist ; Gustavo Arcos , a veteran of Cuban prisons after being , as a youth , Castro 's revolutionary companion ; and 12 other dissident leaders who were being rushed to high-level encounters in diplomatic limousines . They had been more accustomed to crisscrossing the city in police vans . Afterwards , the Mexican president , Ernesto Zedillo , whose foreign minister had conferred with the dissidents , went out of his way to declare that " today , more than ever , sovereignty also needs democracy ... There can be no sovereign nations without free men and women . " The Mexican press concluded that Zedillo 's words marked " a substantial change in relations " with Cuba , which Mexico had always defended . Addressing Castro in public , King Juan Carlos I of Spain urged " full democracy and scrupulous respect for human rights . " The church 's growing political standing in Cuba was further recognized when King Juan Carlos , his prime minister , Jose Maria Aznar , Portugal 's president , Jorge Sampaio , and Brazil 's president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ortega to review the situation . Castro made no effort to conceal his disappointment with the week 's events when he complained at his marathon press conference that " this summit has been fall of virtual realities , dissidents and personalities , but ... nobody is talking about the real objective of the summit . " Economic and social development and trade and investments were the key agenda items of the Havana conference , but all the international media coverage concentrated on the dissidents and the church . Castro 's only consolation may have been the post-summit baseball game between the Cuban team , coached by the 73-year-old Fidel , and the Venezuelan team , which had the Venezuelan president , Hugo Chavez , his chief Latin American admirer , as its pitcher . Cuba won . There is no doubt that the November spectacle , involving both the dissidents and the church , was the most important turning point in Cuba since the January 1998 papal visit , and that it was significantly inspired by John Paul II . It would be unwise , however , to expect deep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphalisms , " and the dissidents are not carried away by easy hopes . But what does count at this stage is that the evolutionary process advocated by the pope is quickening day by day , and is most unlikely to be halted . Meanwhile the greatest contribution the United States can make toward Cuba 's eventual peaceful transition to democracy is to let the Cubans work out their own " reconciliation . " The Clinton administration and the Congress should lift the economic embargo as soon as possible in the new year . This would deprive Castro of his last fig leaf of excuse-the claim that Cuba 's present economic catastrophe is the fault of the Americans . On this issue of removal of the embargo , the Vatican , the Cuban and U.S. churches , the Cuban dissidents , the U.S. business community and , for propaganda reasons , Fidel Castro himself are unanimous . The United States , too , must be open to Cuba-in ways other than covert intelligence operations .
