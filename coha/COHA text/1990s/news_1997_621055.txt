<p> ALREADY TIGER Woods has spun himself deep into his cocoon of concentration , has figuratively hung the do- not-disturb sign from his ear and is ready to play real golf . <p> Yesterday , after his last practice tour of Royal Troon before his first British Open as a professional , Woods was like a glassy- eyed robot as he marched from 18th green to practice tee , then from practice tee to putting green . <p> He zombied past a throng of frantic schoolkids screaming his name , and when a knot of youngsters and a few adults closed in and aggressively surrounded him as if scrumming around a rugby ball , Tiger walked on without blinking as his four security guards pushed and cleared a path . <p> Crossing a parking lot , Woods brushed past Tom Kite , the two all but touching shoulders , and Kite called out a greeting , then turned and shouted , " Hey Tiger ! Tiger ! " But Tiger was in his trance , kept walking . <p> Kite finally shrugged and walked on . <p> Either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous golfer or his entire field of vision has become white and dimpled . <p> " I said to Tiger , ' Did n't you hear Tom holler at you ? ' " said Butch Harmon , Woods ' coach . " He said he did n't hear anything . That shows just how focused he is . " <p> This and other indicators  --  a victory in his most recent tournament , an air of supreme confidence here  --  paint a picture of a Tiger Woods ready to kick some Royal Troon butt . He is the runaway favorite at about 5-1 odds . <p> This is clearly Tiger 's tournament to lose , but golfdom 's golden child has some folks here rooting for Troon to do the butt-kicking . <p> To summarize and oversimplify the view of some golfers and some Scottish fans to the Tiger Invasion : You 've shown some promise , lad , in winning that Masters thing and three other events . But now it 's time to find out what you 're made of on a real golf course , not those cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Troon runs along the Firth of Clyde , which is a large hunk of the Irish Sea . The wind can get brutal ( though milder conditions are forecast ) , the fairways are narrow and bumpy and quirky , and the rough is treacherous . <p> Woods tees off at 1:05 today and if there is any ugly weather to be had , he 'll get it on the back nine , coming home into the teeth of the afternoon wind . <p> Montgomerie believes Tiger will be challenged . The native of nearby Glasgow unintentionally downgraded Tiger 's Masters win , saying , " The course at the Masters was set up for Tiger , and Tom Lehman , Ernie Els , Greg Norman and myself were n't at the top of our games to put more pressure on him . We are on more of a level playing field here . " <p> Montgomerie also advised the media that Tiger would need to ease back on his monster drives because of the tricky winds and deadly rough . <p> " I think Colin needs to take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harmon huffed yesterday , and if the gods of golf have any sense of drama , Monty and Tiger will trot out Sunday in the final twosome . <p> Harmon said there will be no easing back on the throttle by Tiger in deference to the forces of nature . And Harmon could barely contain his excitement over the level of Woods ' readiness for his big challenge . <p> " He 's played beautifully the last two days , " Harmon said . " He feels very confident with the course . It requires a lot of imagination , and that 's right up Tiger 's alley . He 's swinging beautifully . " <p> This will be Woods ' third British Open . He finished 22nd last year and 68th the year before . So why the high hopes now ? <p> " He 's a completely different golfer now , " Harmon said . " Last year he was a college student . Now he 's used to the grind , and he 's playing much better . " <p> One of the four security guards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's obvious he 's much more relaxed this year , " the man said , and made a nervous trembling motion with his hand . " Last year before he teed off , he was like this . " <p> A year later , Woods is about $ 100 million richer and one million times more famous , and twice as cool . <p> Last year Tiger 's gallery for one practice round was three people . Yesterday he went out at 7:30 and despite chilly winds and occasional showers , his gallery numbered several thousand by the time he came down the clubhouse stretch . <p> There is an enormous Tiger curiosity here . He is the top sports story in every newspaper and magazine . When Woods mentioned in a Tuesday press conference that he has received some death threats and hate mail , some of the British papers played it as if his Orlando estate were under imminent threat of nuclear attack . <p> It 's Tigermania for sure , but compared to the furor at the U.S. Open , it 's Mania Lite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large but incredibly respectful , orderly , quiet and subdued . Almost worshipful . <p> Woods ' four security guards  --  no other golfer here has any security  --  are British army officers , and they hold nightly strategy sessions . <p> But they are low-key fellows dressed in neckties and low-key windbreakers . Although Woods ' people asked for armed security on the course , the request was denied and the only armament is one guard 's umbrella . <p> The foursome 's main function so far has been to serve as autograph-fetchers . If you want Tiger 's signature as he moves through a crowd , you have to hand your item to one of the guards , who relays it to Tiger . Adults are turned away , and Tiger signs only a few autographs , always on the move . No eye contact with the fans , no chat . <p> During practice rounds , he interacts with the other players , but also works constantly with Harmon . <p> After each day 's work , Woods heads back to his rented house , to his mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time , they 've got pingpong and a stack of videos , and they do n't go sightseeing or out for meals . <p> Tiger is here to play real golf , and he is real serious . <p> THE 126TH BRITISH OPEN <p> . <p> * WHERE : Troon , Scotland <p> * WHEN : Today through Sunday <p> * COURSE : Royal Troon Golf Club <p> * WINNER 'S PURSE : $ 422,500 <p> * TV : ESPN  --  Today and tomorrow , 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. and 4:30 to 7:30 p.m. ; ABC  --  Saturday , 7 a.m. - 11 a.m. ; Sunday , 6:30 a.m. - 10:30 a.m . <p> * DEFENDING CHAMPION : Tom Lehman <p> . <p> SOMETHING FISHY <p> The wind that starts at the players ' backs At Royal Troon stings their faces as the final six holes play into prevailing northwest gusts . The wind has been known to blow so hard that  --  according to local lore  --  fish were tossed from the Irish Sea onto the fourth green during one particularly breezy day in 1952 . <p> . <p> THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stamp , a beguiling par 3 that , at a mere 128 yards , is the shortest hole in British championship golf . Gene Sarazen played the hole twice at age 71 and never putted . He watched as his 5-iron tee shot rolled into the cup for an ace . The next day , he holed out of a trap to play the hole twice in just three shots total . In 1950 , German amateur Herman Tissies was trying to qualify for the British Open when he went into a bunker on No. 8 . He ended up one-putting  --  for a 15 . <p> . <p> GREAT TO BE A YANKEE <p> The last four British Opens held at Troon were won by Americans  --  Arnold Palmer ( 1962 ) , Tom Weiskopf ( 1973 ) , Tom Watson ( 1982 ) and Mark Calcavecchia ( 1989 ) . <p> . <p> PLACE YOUR BETS <p> Masters champion Tiger Woods is a big favorite , according to the British bookmakers . He is a 5-1 shot , followed by Greg Norman at 7-1 and Nick Faldo at 10-1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odds at 12-1.
