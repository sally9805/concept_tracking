Social workers in hospital settings often experience frustration working in the host setting of a hospital . Some hospital social workers may consider a move to a private primary health care setting to gain more autonomy on the job and the opportunity to provide more direct clinical services and less task-oriented ones . In this article , the authors report a study that compared the autonomy and professional activities of social workers in hospital settings and private primary care settings . It was found that social workers in the two settings do not differ in their level of perceived autonomy and that those in private primary care provide more therapy and counseling . The implications of these and other findings are discussed . <p> A major concern of social workers working in hospital settings is their professional autonomy . Hospitals tend to be bureaucratic . In addition , they are host settings ( Davidson , 1978 ) : In hospitals , physicians are primarily responsible for patient care , and most decision making resides with them . Social workers often have found that such settings markedly reduce their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Bailes , 1985 ) . A further frustration to many hospital social workers is the lack of opportunity to use a wide range of their professional skills , especially counseling ( Baume &; Lewis , 1973 ; Phillips , McCullough , Brown , &; Hambro , 1971 ) . <p> To find a health care setting that allows more professional autonomy and the use of a broad range of their skills , social workers may consider working in private primary health care settings ( hereafter called primary care settings ) . Though social workers have been practicing in primary care for quite some time ( Caccamo , 1969 ; Friedson , 1959 ; Wishingrad , Shulruff , &; Slansky , 1963 ) , no studies could be found in the literature that compared social work practice in primary care settings to that in hospital settings . The purpose of this article is to present findings of a study that compared social workers in primary care and hospital settings . More specifically , this study addressed the following questions : " Do social workers in primary care perceive themselves to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social work practice in primary care different from hospital social work in the types and frequencies of professional activities performed and in the types of patients seen ? " The information provided may be helpful to those hospital social workers thinking about moving into practice in primary care . <p> Reports in the literature of social workers in primary care settings indicated that the social workers , rather than the physicians , initiated the professional arrangement ( Bergstrom , Contro , &; Zivetz , 1984 ; Burbridge , Spasoff , &; Steel , 1982 ; Frangos &; Chase , 1976 ; Gang , 1975 ; Goldberg , 1973 ; Greene &; Kruse , 1985 ; Greene , Kruse , &; Arthurs , 1985 ; Greene , Kruse , &; Kulper , 1986 ; Phillips , 1977 ) . Of social work practice in primary care family practice , Frangos and Chase stated : " Social workers must take the responsibility for moving into this field as competent professionals who will be a valuable addition to the medical team in private practice " ( p. 75 ) . It would seem that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiate , arrange , and maintain a practice in such a setting would tend to be autonomous people who would avoid a practice setting they perceived as limiting their professional activities . <p> Social workers have been struggling for years for autonomy and recognition as a profession in general ( Glicken , 1980 ; Leighninger , 1978 ; Munson , 1979 ) and in health care in particular ( Davidson , 1978 ; Falck , 1978 ) . An important aspect of autonomy is the worker 's attitude toward and perception of the job situation . Autonomy has been described as the perceived freedom from control by nonprofessionals or professions other than one 's own ( Barr , 1980 ) . <p> The authors hypothesized that social workers ' predominant professional activities and tasks are related to their perceptions of autonomy . Social work tasks and activities advocated for primary health care include assessing biopsychosocial functioning , counseling and psychotherapy , educating patients , anticipating and planning for needs of vulnerable patients , consulting with physicians and staff , serving on and possibly leading an interdisciplinary team , planning and facilitating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community , making referrals , finding financial and social support , and managing cases ( Briar , 1983 ; Frangos &; Chase , 1976 ; Greene et al. , 1985 ) . <p> All the professional social work activities and tasks mentioned above are also provided by hospital-based social workers ( Wattenberg &; O'Rourke , 1978 ) . Beyond discharge planning by hospital social workers , it is unclear what social workers in these two settings are doing differently . Because there is no research comparing the two settings , hospital social workers considering moving to a primary care setting or social work students deciding which area will meet their professional interests can only speculate about the differences and how those differences might affect their autonomy . This study 's findings should provide some useful information to such social workers . METHODOLOGY <p> A sample of primary care social workers was obtained from the National Register of Clinical Social Workers , the yellow pages of phone books from major cities in the United States , and volunteers who responded to advertisements in several professional journals and periodicals . These sources provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly working in primary care settings . The authors could not precisely judge the appropriateness of many of the 294 . Many people in the sample were not appropriate for the study and therefore did not return their questionnaires . Consequently , it is impossible to calculate accurately the return rate of the primary care social workers in this study . This sampling procedure was necessary because a comprehensive list from which a sample could be drawn of social workers working in primary care settings could not be found . <p> A computerized random sample of 2000 hospital social workers with master of social work degrees was obtained from the National Association of Social Workers ( NASW ) . These NASW members had described themselves as providers of direct practice services in hospital settings . From this sample , a systematic random sample ( n = 200 ) was drawn . <p> Questionnaires were mailed to the social workers thought to be working in primary care and to the 200 hospital social workers . The instrument asked respondents to give the types of professional services and activities they performed and tine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Wetzel Work ' Independence-Dependence Scale ( Wetzel , 1984 ) was used to measure autonomy . The Wetzel Scale consists of 26 items that are rated on a 7-point Likert Scale , with possible scores ranging from 26 to 182 . The validity and reliability of this scale has been established ( Wetzel &; Redmond , 1980 ) , unlike other studies on autonomy in social work that used nonstandardized instruments developed by each individual researcher ( Bar-Oren , 1977 ; Buffman , 1981 ; Garcia , 1980 ; Myers , 1982 ; Rabinowitz , 1984 ) . FINDINGS <p> Seventy-five questionnaires were returned by social workers working in primary care ; 54 worked full- or part-time in a solo or group private primary care setting , and 21 worked in primary care provided by health maintenance organizations . Seven other respondents from the primary care sample reported working almost exclusively in hospital settings and therefore were combined with the hospital social workers in this study . Eighty-one of the 200 hospital social workers returned their questionnaires . These 81 , together with the 7 hospital social workers mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social workers for this study . <p> Table 1 shows , by setting , the medical specialties in which the respondents worked . Almost five times as many social workers worked in primary care family practice as in hospital-based family practice . Though more respondents worked in primary care psychiatry than in hospital-based psychiatry , the difference was not large . There were considerably more hospital social workers than primary care social workers in the " other " category . No primary care social workers in this study worked in cardiology , oncology , or ophthalmology . <p> A t-test was used to examine the differences between social workers in primary care and those in hospital settings on the Wetzel Work Independence-Dependence Scale . No statistically significant differences were found . This finding indicates that social workers in primary care do not perceive themselves as being any more autonomous on the job than do hospital social workers . <p> The respondents were asked to approximate the percentage of their time per month spent in various activities , with various age groups of patients , and in treating various presenting problems . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than 100 percent because some respondents ' totals did not equal 100 percent . The t-test was used to examine the differences between primary care social workers and hospital social workers on these variables . <p> The primary care social workers spent significantly more time than the hospital social workers doing individual therapy and couples therapy ( Table 2 ) . There was no significant difference between the two groups on the amount of time spent in family therapy . The hospital social workers spent significantly more time per month consulting with other professionals , referring patients to community agencies , and recording cases . Patient education was performed very little by either group , especially the primary care social workers . <p> Well over one-third ( 37.0 percent ) of the hospital social workers ' time was spent in the task-oriented activities of making referrals to other community agencies , recording cases , and consulting with other professionals , whereas the primary care social workers engaged in these activities only 14.0 percent of the time . When individual , couples , and family therapy ; group work ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were involved in direct services to patients 75.3 percent of the time , whereas the hospital social workers spent barely half their time providing direct services ( 50.4 percent ) . This difference is statistically significant , t = 5.62 , p &lt; .001 . <p> Differences between the two groups on time spent with various presenting problems seem to fall into two categories . The hospital social workers spent significantly more time with psychosocial problems specifically related to physical ailments : coping with disease , dealing with grief , and arranging for institutional placement . The primary care social workers spent more time with psychosocial problems that have an emotional basis and that often have somatic correlates : depression , stress , anxiety attacks , and relationship problems ( Table 3 ) . <p> The differences between primary care social workers and hospital social workers on the amount of time spent working with different age groups were also examined ( Table 4 ) . No differences were found in younger client groups , but primary care social workers worked significantly more often with age groups 19-22 and 23-45 . Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more with clients over the age of 46 . <p> In order to find whether a relationship existed between the workers ' level of perceived professional autonomy and their percentages of time spent in various professional activities with different presenting problems and age groups , the Pearson product-moment correlation was used to analyze the relationships between scores on the Wetzel Scale and these variables . All the coefficients were less than .19 , with most being less than .10 . These findings indicate that the level of a social worker 's perceived autonomy is not related to the amount of time spent in specific professional activities , with specific presenting problems , or with specific age groups of patients . DISCUSSION <p> The results of this study suggest that social workers currently in hospital settings who want only to have more autonomy should not consider moving to a primary care setting . Perhaps these two settings are more similar than different . Both are considered host settings , institutions not geared primarily toward practicing social work ; the physician is the one primarily responsible for patient care . Nassar ( 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private practice , and a host environment and found those in the host environment perceived themselves as least autonomous of the three . <p> Another similarity of these settings is the fact that the social workers in both are likely to be the only professionals focusing primarily on the psychosocial aspects of patient care . The physicians , nurses , and allied health care professionals focus primarily on the physical aspects of patients  --  even in psychiatric settings , given the biological focus of current psychiatry . Perhaps the difference of focus , be it in a hospital or a physician 's office , limits the social worker 's perception of autonomy . <p> The place of social workers in the organizational structure and its operations also may affect perceived autonomy . Barr ( 1980 ) hypothesized that the more bureaucratic the organization is , the less autonomous the professional employees will perceive themselves to be . This hypothesis was not supported by the findings of Barr 's study . Barr found that physicians in health maintenance organizations ( HMOs ) retained their professional autonomy by getting involved in the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have the freedom of a private practice , they did have a voice in deliberating their salary , grievance procedures , quality assurance , and even proposed legislation . Perhaps hospital social workers derive a sense of autonomy from having their own department within the hospital , where they can make decisions affecting their department and the practice of individual social workers . This latter observation is relevant , assuming that hospitals are more bureaucratic than primary care settings . It is not necessarily true , because some HMOs as primary care facilities can be quite large . Further research is needed on the relationship between the different sizes of primary care settings and hospitals and the effects of such differences on perceived social worker autonomy . <p> Another possible factor in the similarity found between these two groups of social workers is that those in primary care may have begun their social work careers in a hospital . This is a good setting for establishing professional relationships with physicians in the community , and many social workers may switch from the hospital to the private practices of these physicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may still feel dependent on the physicians for referrals and office space and thus perceive themselves as no more autonomous than in the hospital . <p> If hospital social workers are primarily interested in doing individual and couples therapy in health care settings , then they should consider moving to a primary care setting . Respondents in both groups spent a similar amount of time doing family therapy . It may be that the purposes of family therapy do differ by setting , with family therapy in primary care being more traditional family therapy as practiced in family service agencies , and family therapy practiced by hospital social workers being focused more on discharge planning and the family 's involvement in after care . In addition , primary care social workers do not appear to be following Briar 's ( 1983 ) and Miller 's ( 1983 ) assertions that they should emphasize patient education or Briar 's proposal that they emphasize locating and coordinating resources for patients . <p> Social workers in the two settings do focus on two generally different types of problems . The types of problems seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lend themselves to individual or couples therapy , whereas the types of problems seen most often by hospital social workers would require task oriented activities along with some counseling . <p> There were no significant differences between primary care and hospital social workers in time spent with patients up to the age of 19 . Miller ( 1983 ) proposed that adolescents are a good target population for primary care social worker services , because they are often underserved in the community . These findings , however , indicate that social workers in primary care may not be following Miller 's suggestion . Social workers in primary care , according to this study 's findings , are serving primarily young adults , whereas hospital social workers are primarily serving middle-aged and elderly adults . This latter finding should not be surprising , because more of older people 's problems requiring hospitalization are of a primary medical nature than of a psychosocial nature . <p> Limitations in this study should be considered in the interpretation of its findings . The social workers in the primary care sample were self selected and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers in such settings . Certainly , a probability sample would have been better , but , as noted previously , this was not possible . The sample of hospital social workers , though randomly selected , also was not necessarily an accurate representation of all hospital social workers , because not all hospital social workers belong to NASW , the source of the sample . The information resulting from this study should be helpful to those present and future social workers looking for career options outside the hospital , the traditional work setting for social workers in health care . SUMMARY <p> If medical social workers are interested in autonomous positions , a move from a hospital to a primary care setting does not appear to be the answer . However , if hospital social workers are interested in doing fewer task-oriented activities and increasing their time in direct clinical work and therapy within a health care setting , a move to private primary care is recommended . Further , if hospital social workers are interested in working with young patients and with psychosocial problems that are primary diagnoses rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a primary care setting is advised .
