An African-American student at a placid Vermont college is getting anonymous hate notes . The college responds , predictably , with race-sensitivity forums . Rebecca Gilman 's new play , having its world premiere at Chicago 's Goodman Theatre , could have been an easy diatribe against racism and the perils of political correctness . Instead , it 's a complex , unnerving look at the way real people navigate between them both . Mary Beth Fisher gives a penetrating performance as the dean whose life is unraveled by the case .

She 's an important new theatrical voice . <P>  --  By Richard Zoglin
