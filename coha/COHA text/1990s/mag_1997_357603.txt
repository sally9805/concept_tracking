How do you take the measure of a woman 's life at 50 , when her generation  --  or at least its passionate front line  --  has broken all the rules ? " There is no formula that I 'm aware of for being a successful or fulfilled woman today , " Hillary Rodham Clinton once said . " Perhaps it would be easier ... if we could be handed a pattern and cut it out , just as our mothers and grandmothers and foremothers were . But that is not the way it is today , and I 'm glad it is not . " <P> On Oct. 26 , Hillary turns 50 , which is a birthday that compels almost any woman to step back and examine whether the drape and line of her life fit the woman she once dreamed of becoming . The cutting edge of female Baby Boomers , of whom Hillary is the most famous , approached adulthood with a wild , subversive earnestness . These women would change the world , have careers , build strong marriages , raise good children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beneficiary of these expectations , and as First Lady also their most conspicuous victim . Her Wellesley education and Yale law degree put her onstage ( as the student speaker at her college commencement and later as one of the nation 's " most influential " lawyers ) , but they also moved her to the side when her husband 's Arkansas constituency chafed at her insistence on being called Ms. Rodham . They put her in a new kind of spotlight as the victorious spouse of this nation 's first Baby Boomer President , but she stepped off the stage again when her mishandling of health-care reform almost crippled his presidency . <P> Now she is getting ready to come onstage again , into some treacherous politics . For the first time since her health-care debacle , the First Lady is preparing to assume a leading role on a policy issue that sweeps every corner of American life , opening questions of government 's role , corporate responsibilities and even the very nature of family . As Hillary wrote in her best-selling book It Takes a Village , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissension anywhere in America , start talking about child care . " <P> To begin her moderation of the issue , the First Lady will lead a major White House conference on child care next week ; she promises to lay out the problem 's complexities with her customary intellectual rigor . " You have to put the issue in front of the American people and get them to look at it honestly , " she told TIME last week in a late-night interview at her hotel suite in Panama City , Panama , where she spoke at a conference of First Ladies of the Americas . But already the ideological lines on child care are forming , bracing for confrontation . " It 's very clear , " says Hillary 's old ally , children 's advocate Marian Wright Edelman , " that child care is going to have a private-sector piece , a state piece , a community piece and a Federal Government piece . " In other words , retorts conservative guru Paul Weyrich , child care is going to be " the new entitlement of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
