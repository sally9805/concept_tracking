Green is the color that defines them , of course . They do n't realize yet , but it s already there in the picture . <p> Look closely , and Susan 's wearing a grass-green peridot and pearl ring on her engagement finger , for Jim , who 's coming to meet her as the S.S. Carinthia steams into New York Harbor . And Keith has on his olive-checked shirt while they stand with their Fulbright group at the lower-deck rail , catching the last of the sea breeze and watching for Manhattan to appear out of the whitening August haze . <p> Finally here she is , unbelievable but true : New York materializing lightly over the ruffled water . The crystalline formation rises in outline , higher and higher : a pure sci-fi dream of a city . <p>  --  The door dilated , Keith declaims , making a kind of spaceman salute . <p> Susan has both hands tight on the rail .  --  So , we actually did it , we left  --  <p> These are not the oppressed aliens that Emma Lazarus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , " accidentals , " an ornithologist would call them . In 1962 , it 's not yet the big wave of Eurotrash  --  just educated drifters blown off current by some personal disaffection . <p> Keith and Susan are headed for the same New England university , and have made a convenient alliance . She 's confessed to him , somewhere out there on the gray Atlantic , her evil habit of poaching married men , which , she insists , is now over ! Hence the plan for Jim to get a Mexican divorce , and for the two of them to reunite forever after this year , in Texas , where he has a legitimate job . Keith has described to her his mad efforts to get a queer life among his native Yorkshire dales , despite the family 's prominence in their banker 's villa , despite a rural world in which bestiality is the only known perversion , and despite the wide-open moorland , its low stone walls and general lack of cover . For miles and miles about , there 's ne'er a bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even at Cambridge , in all other ways a paradise , Keith felt constrained by his parents ' expectations for their only son . Their presence stuck in his head so obstinately , the only hope he had was to leave the country . <p> Now Manhattan 's closer , threatening to become something real , made of steel-reinforced concrete as well as glass . <p>  --  Never mind , Keith says .  --  Look , we already know the language  --  how hard can it be ? <p>  --  Right , says Susan .  --  Exactly my sentiments . <p> Carinthia docks on the lordly Hudson side . When they 've run the Customs gauntlet , distant relatives of Keith claim him for the two weeks until college starts . No sign of Jim , though , anywhere . Susan sets to and hauls her suitcase to the taxi rank . At least she has the name of his hotel . <p> But , good Christ ! Manhattan at ground level is one continuing assault of explosive noise and motion  --  insane jackhammers going at you from this side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sirens in perpetual spasm . And this huge fist of heat clamps down on her  --  ninety-five degrees registered on a display . A news billboard says this marks a third summer of record drought and temperatures . The street simmers with radiated fire . Susan has no hat , no sunglasses . Nobody ever told her about this . In the bag clenched against her ribs she has just sixty dollars . She waits in line half an hour for a cab : time enough to suspect an irreparable mistake . Those three years ' worth of absolute belief that she and Jim were each other 's great love and best friend , her confidence that they would really end up together  --  some unknown percentage of all that is being sweated out of her , secretly evaporated away , every minute while she 's standing on this yellow line . <p> She does find Jim , in the cool hotel lounge , convinced of course that this was their original agreement . Susan lets it pass , why not ? Their room is wonderfully high up , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , and a bed for making wonderfully clean , air-conditioned love . Everything 's fine again , America looking better by the minute . <p> Next day , Jim takes her along to an expensive lunch with the editor who 's bringing out his study of Ezra Pound and Propertius . A cheerful guy , he orders an extra-fine bottle of wine ; and what he really wants to do , it appears , is tell them his story of how William Empson , in Hong Kong before the war , arranged for Mrs. Empson to give him his first fuck , even leading him by hand to the marital bed itself . <p> A good fuck , was it ? He confides , smugly , that it was an incomparable educational experience . <p> Another day , and Jim is leaving , authentic Green Card in his wallet , for the flight to Texas . Susan begs thirty dollars off him : taking money feels like a dirty thing to do , but she needs the cash . But then , the goodbye kiss she gives him feels dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . Shaken , as if by one more bad omen , she goes back into the hotel lobby and calls a number written on a postcard : Lili 's , on East nth . <p> An Australian friend made the connection for her , Ed the philosopher , who was a member along with Lili and Germaine Greer of the Sydney Push  --  a group formed around the libertarian thinker John Anderson , and now scattered worldwide . Lili has since become a journalist , entertainment correspondent in the U.S. for a Sydney paper . Susan holds the battered postcard that Ed passed on to her . Sure , it says , in letters blurred by sweaty contact , August is her slow season . Ed 's bloody Pom is welcome to stay . <p> The cab lets Susan off in front of a row of brick tenements hung with black fire escapes . There 's a corner shop with fruit displayed , and she buys six peaches . Under the eleven o'clock blaze of sun , her too-thick shirt and jeans cling like wet armor on her skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the right door and press the button , she 's panting like a dog . Then , the sound of flip-flops on the staircase , and Lili , in a muumuu with a pattern of emerald leaves , leads the way upstairs into a room where fans chatter in the windows . <p> Susan does a visual check , and figures this is just a one-room flat . Another moment of awful doubt : what 's she let herself in for now ? <p>  --  Christ , girl , you look fucked ! Lili says . She reaches into the fridge for a bottle of cold bubbly water , pours a glass , and puts it into Susan 's hand .  --  Take this for a start . <p> The cooling liquid goes down , percolating through membranes into millions of grateful cells . And Susan 's becoming vaguely conscious of her enormous luck , here , falling into the hands of a true guide and psychopomp . Because Lili , who is technically almost her own age , has lived like a bubble on the flood from the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , somehow , in Italy . She escaped the DP camps with her parents to Australia , and has escaped again to New York , where she 's in love with the city forever . Lili owns all the keys . She knows , she always knew , how to be an alien . <p> The apartment is quickly decoded : Lili sleeps in the curtained alcove to the right of the door , and to the left are the fridge , stove , sink , and a hip-bath fitted ingeniously under the lift-up countertop . The toilet , down the corridor , is shared with other tenants  --  it 's unspeakable , what can you do ?  --  and you take the toilet roll in with you and bring it back after . About the guest bed , ready made up under the window there : it 's a good idea to tap on it several times , up and down , before getting in . That 's to allow the roaches time to move out ; if you pull the sheet back too suddenly , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Susan tries just that a few nights later , and a dozen roaches dash about hysterically . She feels so embarrassed for them . ) <p>  --  Y'see , Lili explains ,  --  even if ya bomb the bastards , which I do once in a while , the neighbors bomb them right back . <p> So this is downtown America . Susan 's never lived in such a density of vermin before , with roaches into everything but the freezer , rats patrolling the alley at night , and a late-summer praying mantis living in the window box of herbs behind the sink . But she 's never met , either , anyone like Lili , who makes this generous sacrifice without question , letting an absolute stranger come in to share her space . If she 'd known , she 'd never have dared ask . Even trying to say thanks , she stammers . <p>  --  So , Lili says , grinning ,  --  your bloke 's buggered off to Texas , eh ? Typical ! What d ' you think of that ? <p>  --  Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm buggering off to Boston for a year , that 's my deal , while he works out this divorce . Meanwhile I 've only seventy-five dollars to last two weeks . And here 's all I brought you : six peaches . <p> This stirs Lili 's pride : she can deliver New York for that much , and give change back . <p> That afternoon they hit 14th Street and the sale at Gimbels , where Susan gets a loose , dark-red shirtdress , cut above the knee , for seven-fifty . Green sunglasses off the street : two-fifty . Later , with Susan wearing her new schmatte , they take a sunset walk past Delancey Street to the East River view . Next day to Bloomingdale 's , just to check out the top-price stuff for fall  --  and there by pure chance is Lili 's friend Jeannie , the model with a spread in this month 's Vogue , going through the racks . <p> Jeannie invites them into her dressing room while she tries on a couple of things . She strips down to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark hair , and coolly turns herself before the mirrors . Susan has never seen a world-class beauty up close before , and almost naked . The symmetrical line of Jeannie 's body seems as if newly drawn , in one long stroke of some divine stylus  --  finished off with a horizontal comma at the navel . No wonder Jeannie does n't mind them looking : she 's astonishing from any angle . <p>  --  My God , the flab ! she moans , stroking her pale-tan midriff.  --  I have to starve five pounds off , by September . <p>  --  Such a bitch , says Lili.  --  As if we were n't dying of envy already . <p> Jeannie laughs , and zips something on , smoothing and turning , looking at herself over her shoulder , then unzips , throws it down , and starts over . This is a lousy year , in her view  --  the colors are all muddy  --  nothing looks good except jeans anymore . <p> Lili takes leave with a kiss , and says hi to a young man sitting alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Jeannie 's boyfriend  --  French , she tells Susan . <p>  --  Almost as pretty as her . And awfully young , is n't he ? <p>  --  I should bloody hope so ! She 's put in her time , y'know , with those rich old buggers when she was nineteen , twenty . Now she can afford to please herself  --  it 's fair enough . <p> The next day , they ride the Staten Island ferry for a nickel , then it 's to Ratner 's for blintzes . At the weekend , they do Jones Beach , then a cocktail party in a fiftieth-floor apartment somewhere in Midtown . A thunderstorm has just passed through when they arrive , leaving tattered veils of cloud drifting past the huge windows , changing slowly from gray to lavender . Everything inside the apartment is in pale-neutral , and the women wear black dresses , except Lili in her leopard-print drape , and Susan in the red shift that she takes off only for sleep , or to wash . <p> Then they 're in a group talking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch the Chrysler building glow in the dimming light . Someone brings up the Royal Family , right in her face , so she answers , automatically :  --  Oh , sod the frigging royals , bloodsuckers , who gives a shit ? <p> Which an older fellow , whom Lili introduced as Manny , takes as a come-on . He attaches himself to her , bringing her refills of gin and tonic , tells her he 's in the theater business , and spins her a long joke about a little Jewish guy who makes money and goes to London for a bespoke suit , then stands in front of the tailor 's mirror , draws himself up , and utters these words : Pity we lost India ! <p> And Susan just does not get it . What is so damn funny  --  why is Manny bent over with tears of laughter in his eyes ? He repeats the punchline , shaking with the hilarity of it . She understands the words , sure , Pity we lost India , but what the fuck is the point ? Nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Left circle , would be capable of thinking about India 's independence that way . She 's beginning to worry about aspects of the language here that she does n't grasp : traps under the apparent familiarity . <p> But Manny 's not done with her yet . He gets serious :  --  You could make it here , kid , y'know that ? With that mouth on ya , and the accent ? No , listen , I 'm telling ya the truth ! Ya got ta fix the hair  --  I can recommend a guy . And those eyebrows ! Got ta lose the sad-clown look , know what I mean ? Do the eyebrows right , it makes all the difference . Believe me . ' Cause I think you got a lot going for you , so make the most of yourself . Know what I mean ? <p> Well , she appreciates his advice , yes , she does . Will seriously think it over . ( For this , too , is America , land of perfectibility . ) <p> Then Lili pulls her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now :  --  Just forget all that . Manny does n't know shit about you , remember ? We 're going down to the Village for pizza  --  Glen and Rob have a car . <p>  --  Guys in the black leather ? <p>  --  Sure , they 're fine . They 're both social workers  --  you never have to worry about fucking ' em , the whores give ' em free blow jobs all the time . <p>  --  I see . <p> Silent memo to herself : ask Lili privately what the blow job is . It 's related , conceivably , to the graffiti she 's noticed on the local subway platform : George sucks . Which suggests some version of the old-style soixante-neuf ? Well , best to be sure . <p> They park in Greenwich Village , and walk a few blocks to John 's Pizza . But before they arrive , Susan catches a vision across an intersection that stops her cold . It is some kind of superhuman , well over six feet , and the dark-bronze face and those bare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's wearing a woman 's outfit that puts Lili 's flamboyance to shame . A fuchsia boa winds loosely about the shoulders , shining bangles and charms hang from the neck and wrists , and that drop-dead dress is made in alternating panels of black and vivid aquamarine satin , with a short flip skirt . The final touch , a great floppy beret , blue and black check . He turns and paces aloofly along opposite them , showing off gold high-heels and black fishnets , and Jeannie herself could n't command a more sinuous walk . <p>  --  Who is that ? Susan asks . <p> Glen answers ,  --  Who , Marlene ? She 's here every weekend , it 's her beat . <p> His indifferent tone tells much . There are aliens and non-aliens , and evidently Marlene is at home in this place , whether Glen likes it or not . But how would Keith , she wonders , himself a village boy , take this revelation ? <p> The day before Susan leaves on the train for Boston , Lili prepares for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have scheduled a press reception . Susan 's vastly impressed that Lili will meet Burton , since she remembers his performance as Coriolanus at the Old Vic , before he was a film star : that voice with its ominous resonance , and the great silences even more . <p>  --  Darlin ' , listen to me , Lili says , and the flat edge of her accent cuts memory down to size .  --  You and me do n't give a fuck about Liz ' n ' Richard . Listen . These are not real people . What this is , is a press conference , and maybe they 'll show up , maybe not . It 's just my job . <p> Even so , Lili spends Labor Day Monday applying beauty treatments handed down by her grandmother , in case Hollywood does show up . She whisks together a mask of yogurt , cucumber , and honey for the face ; then an egg and lemon mix to massage into her hair . After her bath , she rests with cold herbal tea bags laid on her eyelids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an undertint of olive ; her gray eyes resemble smoky moonstones , and her blond hair , cut straight at the jawline , swings free like shaken silk . <p> Susan says it candidly : she 's beautiful . <p>  --  Just the job , darlin ' . Do what I can , given the limitations . Lili gestures towards her body  --  short , strong , and rounded , on the Slavic model ( when she goes out at night , she disciplines it with a ferocious Playtex panty-girdle ) . But her hands are small and exquisitely kept : and deny it as she would , she cares about that . <p> Susan thinks she 'll remember everything about her time with Lili , but she does n't remember the morning she left  --  only that the summer weather has broken , and rain is hammering the city as she catches the train north . It 's understood , though , that Lili never leaves New York , except on business or for her mother in Sydney . If Susan is to stay connected , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the International Student Center reception , over platters of bland cheese cubes ringed with Ritz crackers and grapes . They recognize not just each other , but a shared mood of dreamy loss , which it turns out has the same source : they 've each caught a glimpse of Greenwich Village , and lost it again . The Village , which is shorthand for everything : the street life , espresso bars on the corner , jazz clubs , invisible airs of incense and grass fumes rising from dim groups among the Washington Square tree-lined alleys , and then , the entertainers under the arch ... <p>  --  And then , Keith tells her in awed secrecy ,  --  there was this extraordinary black man on the street , some gorgeous Watusi in a red tam-o ' - shanter and a miniskirt , no less . <p>  --  Of course  --  I saw him . Six foot five , in full makeup and heels , yes ! <p>  --  Oh my God , was n't he amazing ? <p>  --  Except that the one I saw had on a blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it possible there 's two super-tall transvestites out there ? <p>  --  Anything 's possible , Susan says , admitting her submission as true Village believer .  --  A guy I was with said her name was Marlene . <p>  --  You were introduced ? <p>  --  No , no  --  it 's what he said . <p>  --  So where were you staying ? <p>  --  East 11th . Bit of a dump , frankly . Every morning around six , incredible traffic noise and everything started up . Still , you could even walk to the Village . <p>  --  You and Jim ? <p>  --  No , no , he left . I stayed with Lili , this journalist I sort of knew . <p> Susan 's bragging ; she knows it and ca n't help herself , with Keith eating it up . <p>  --  I was stuck way out in Westchester , he says , grimacing .  --  Imagine High Wycombe , only the houses and everything inflated to double-size . <p> The two of them seal their bond through a disparagement of Boston and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  everything round here 's so hopelessly deja vu . Sort of like Manchester but with a river . <p>  --  Exactly . And all these other areas looking like bloody Neasden , only the houses are made of tarpaper and wood . <p>  --  Exactly . Susan , I should tell you , I 've made a promise to myself . Keith looks off into the far reaches of the cafeteria , over his Jell-O and hermit with faux cream on the side .  --  I 'm going to live in New York . In two years ' time , one way or another , that 's what I 'm going to do . <p>  --  Lucky Keith . I 'd do it myself , if I had the chance . <p> They enroll in the same seminar , on " The American Renaissance . " After a brief hesitation , Susan concedes to Moby Dick  --  the way , she says , you just have to concede to Blake ; and when Keith reaches the bedroom scene with Queequeg , he gives in also . But then , Hawthorne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other the egregiously ponderous bits : <p>  --  It is a heavy annoyance to a writer , who endeavors to represent nature , its various attitudes and circumstances , in a reasonably correct outline and true coloring , that so much of the mean and ludicrous should be hopelessly mixed up with the purest pathos . . . <p>  --  Oh , bloody hell , mate , get the fuck on with it ! Right , here 's one for you , Suze : This fair girl deemed herself conscious of a power  --  combined of beauty , high , unsullied purity , and the preservative force of womanhood  --  that could make her sphere impenetrable , unless betrayed by treachery within . <p>  --  Preservative force ? Susan figures .  --  He must mean pickled in laudanum , the ladies ' favorite treat of the times . Nice reference to penetration , though . Could n't get away with that after Freud . <p> But Hawthorne will never fly for them  --  the stuff simply reeks of self-consciousness , a perpetual irritation  --  and at the same time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killer . Something of the same problem with Emerson , too , even Thoreau . There 's a smell about this old New England sensibility that evokes too clearly those uninviting chapels in Midlands towns that they used to avoid by rocketing past on the train . <p> Weekends , penniless Susan stays on campus , writing letters and watching the beautiful undergraduates from a lonely distance . Keith , who has money sent from home , goes into Cambridge and Boston , and comes back now and then with adventures to report . Example : when Anthony Perkins is filming something in the area , and takes Keith up to his hotel room to give him a blow job ( no mystery now to Susan ) . <p>  --  Have fun , then ? <p>  --  Well , yes , flirting in the bar was lots of fun , says Keith .  --  And when we went to his room , I thought I did my bit okay . But he seemed in a hurry to get rid of me afterwards . Rather annoying . <p> Susan quotes Lili @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get on film , they 're just not real people anymore . <p> There 's a graduate student party at the end of the semester , where Susan gets drunk and goes to bed with a plausible guy from the American Lit. seminar who , after one straightforward routine , wakes her up in the wee hours pressing her to take it in the rear . That 's what he really , really wants . But Susan puts him off , resorting to a new phrase she 's learned , Not on the first date . And she does n't like him enough for a second date , although she 's grateful for the new information : this , too , is America , liking it best in the arse or the mouth  --  anywhere but the obvious . <p> She talks about it with Keith . His predictable view is that American men are mostly queer , but ca n't fundamentally admit it . Susan speculates otherwise : there 's too many Catholics about the place , for one thing , and for another , the frightening level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pub life , of little cafes and shops , which connects in turn to the oversized roads , and these vast distances between places . <p> Jim comes to Boston for three days of Christmas vacation , before going on to a conference in San Francisco . They make love in their familiar , satisfying way , which is oddly disconcerting to Susan , for in a strange land , even familiar things appear subtly changed . Three weeks later she writes to him that she 's missed her period . <p> He writes back ( is he psychic all of a sudden , or extrapolating from his own private adventures in Texas ? ) to say well , if she is pregnant , can she be absolutely sure that he 's the father ? He does n't like to imply anything , but after those months apart , and given his scrupulosity about using a condom ( even though she used a diaphragm ) , if there was , by chance , some " altr'uomo "  --  well , he 'd have certain feelings about that  --  <p> The day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a half-guilty rage , Susan wakes up to find a bloodstain on her nightdress . The threat of pregnancy is over . She begins composing , first in her head , then on paper , her Dear Jim letter . In it , she takes all the blame , grovels in self-abasement for not staying the course , and regrets all the emotional carnage she has caused . But she 's clear : it 's over , it 's absolutely gone . Jim 's reply , in turn , lets her off charitably  --  even though she wo n't learn for another year that he has already met , down in Texas , the woman he 'll soon call his Dark Lady , the great love of his life . Those two will never marry , either : that 's how it is with Dark Ladies . <p> Jim and Susan continue to exchange Christmas cards every year , with a brief letter inside , and in this way she learns that Jim marries twice more , though he begets no children . Each wife in turn will happen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the five commonest names for girls in America ( Mary is number one ) , so one can hardly make much of it . <p> Keith seems to be the one most troubled by the breakup . <p>  --  I thought you guys had the real thing ! he protests .  --  You went through all that Sturm und Drang to make this happen . And then , the moment marriage becomes a real possibility , you just blow it away . I am so disappointed in you , Susan . <p>  --  Perhaps I 'm allergic to marriage . I 'm sorry , Susan tells him , although she 's dead-tired of apologies . <p>  --  Not only that , says Keith ,  --  you 've deprived me of one of my favorite lines in English verse , remember ? If Susan comes , can Jim be far behind ? <p>  --  Shut up , Keith . Do n't depress me . Just because there are n't any classic poems with ' Keith ' in them  --  and just because there 's no Keith Shakespeare , Keith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not yet  --  give me a little time ! <p>  --  Anyway , says Susan ,  --  you 'll at least be glad to know I 've decided on my romantic future . It 's all settled . I 'm going to marry America , warts and all . I shall bake hermits , and brownies , and have Tupperware parties , and be a den mother , all for lovely America . My sweetheart . <p>  --  That was fast work , says Keith .  --  As for me , I 'll be happy just getting screwed by lovely America  --  <p> At the end of the year , Keith is worried . He has to visit his family in the U.K. , and frankly , he looks so much more handsome , and more gay , than when he came over that it 's a problem . He 's developed a little muscle , playing tennis , and picked up a great tan . ( Actually , Susan knows he uses a touch of facial bronzer , to enhance the effect . ) When he goes out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . With his white tees , and his old cricket pullover , well , he 's quite something . But how is he to face the parents ? <p> On her side , Susan has scraped up barely enough money from her TA work , and serving as an experimental subject in psychology , to keep her dorm room for the summer . She 's got a part-time job transcribing dictated field notes and paper revisions for a professor in sociology , which pays her food money . So Keith persuades her to take three weeks out of that for a trip home  --  he 'll pick up her airfare , if she 'll come to Yorkshire with him and play the role of " the girl I 'm seriously interested in . " <p>  --  This is very weird , Keith , but if it 's that important to you  --  <p>  --  Well , I 'm afraid it is . <p>  --  Then okay . I know how to do these things . I was actually engaged , once . I mean , before Jim . <p> There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold meat-loaf sandwiches from an old family recipe at lunch , the healthy walk and admiration of the scenery before tea , and the decidedly separate rooms at bedtime . Questions will be fielded adroitly  --  it 'll be understood that Susan 's family in suburban London is looking forward to meeting Keith also , the next week ( when in fact , he 'll be having a hellfire time around the old haunts ) . At the station again , a powdery goodbye kiss on the cheek , warm smiles , and the charade is over . <p>  --  Did it work okay ? Susan asks him when they meet at the pub in St. Martin 's Lane . He 's utterly transformed again , of course , with the leather jacket and ultra jeans he 'd left at a friend 's . <p>  --  Thanks to you , I get a pass this time . Better give me your family stats , before I forget , so I can spin them the rest of it . <p>  --  Right . Got a notepad ? Dad passed on a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local hospital . Two sisters , one older , one younger . Nurse , and generally fucked-up rock fan , respectively . <p>  --  Ah , come on ! <p>  --  Okay , she 's officially a vet 's assistant . Likes animals . But you know something else ? Our grocer at home took me for a Canadian  --  already . It 's happening ! <p>  --  But not to me , says Keith .  --  With you , I could tell the rot was setting in when you got that blouse with a round collar . <p>  --  What can I do ? Just a porous person  --  <p> In three years , Keith and Susan have passed their comprehensive exams : they 've learned to write respectful analyses of Hawthorne , and to compete in the job market . Keith has won his dream job , right there in Manhattan , at Fordham . Never mind , he says , if there are crucifixes on the wall  --  forget those  --  he can already feel the rumble of New York streets under his footsoles , the wind through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Susan 's thesis director has helped her to a place upstate , at Mount Holyoke . <p>  --  I knew it would n't happen , she says .  --  When I was in England , I never managed to live in London proper . Now I 'm here , I 'll never manage to live in New York . Stupid , stupid . And I miss seeing Lili so much ! <p> The next time Susan gets a long weekend in the city , she 's with her new guy , and Lili explains over the phone that she 's hooked up now with a radical lesbian , which means she ca n't be in a social encounter of any kind with a man . The two of them meet alone one afternoon , for coffee . But it 's a sorry meeting , apart from interesting gossip about Judy Collins 's private life . Lili has gained weight , and she does n't even look as happy as her conversion had predicted . No matter how sympathetic Susan is , she 's instructed that she has cast in her lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself  --  but wait , does she intend to marry this man ? Well , that could happen , eventually . It could ? Then there 's no more to say on the subject , it 's hopeless . <p> Two years further on , Susan sends Lili a birth announcement , out of courtesy , because Lili has sent her a change-of-address announcement ( she 's moved to a better place , on the western fringe of the Village proper ) . Susan also has moved , still in New England . <p> Another summer , and Lili calls to say she 's coming north on assignment , to interview an actress on location , and can she stay on for a couple of nights , after she 's filed the story ? Men , she adds , do n't bother her anymore ; although she 's still living with a woman , it 's a different woman . Lili arrives with a clear plastic tote bag containing a toothbrush , hairbrush , a wig , and the extra black T-shirt ( but to be sure , her professional makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the connection is back : Lili greets her with a complete embrace , and needs no excuse of politeness to admire Susan 's girl-child , at eighteen months a feminist 's dream of joyously untrammeled self-will . <p> The second night , an operatic thunderstorm rolls overhead at four a.m . Susan wakes , and comes to sit in her living room ( how strange , she thinks , with Lili under her roof , to find oneself a person with a living room  --  ) . There , Lili joins her  --  Lili , who was never woken by Manhattan 's traffic , but who is genuinely scared by lightning and thunder . Susan gets them drinks , and they sit in the flickering dark while the storm passes on . <p>  --  I 'll be moving again , next month , Lili says suddenly .  --  I love women , y'know , but living together does n't work . And to be honest , what I really do like is to be penetrated . That 's what I want . <p> Susan thinks for a moment .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree  --  there 's nothing like it . <p>  --  I mean , there 's dildos , and Julie uses a strap-on , so it 's not a total loss that way , but it 's still plastic  --  it is n't the same thing . <p>  --  It has to be penetration in the flesh  --  that other body , does n't it ? <p>  --  That 's the thing I want . In the end . Which reminds me  --  <p> And Lili goes into a long riff on the personal history of a famous rock groupie she 's close to .  --  So I finally tell her , You are such a whore ! And she says to me , How can you say that , when I have n't had anyone since the Tremolos six months ago ? <p> Rock music and musicians have become her great passion , the subject of the book which will make her name in New York and beyond , and give her almost everything she 's ever wished for , but will also ( as she tells it ) take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station next day , she 'll be seeing her once more only , in the exotic cave of a studio she 's made for herself in the city  --  the place where she will die , recognized but alone , of an acute asthma attack . <p> Keith , who 's living way uptown from Lili , in the Bronx , will not share even that degree of good fortune . True , he writes Susan one letter from Fordham , where he 's a popular teacher of what they call there British Lit. , indicating that New York 's pleasures and adventures exceed his wildest dreams . " Wildest " is underlined . <p> But even as Susan herself is losing track of time , immersed in the heroics of mothering , the baking of hermits and brownies , arranging of Tupperware parties , the news comes to her by way of Joel , whom Keith , he 's been found dead . Took an immense overdose of sleeping pills , and died two days ago . It 's even worse than that , Joel tells her , because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of attempted murder of his roommate , whom he attacked earlier that night with a tire iron , and left with a smashed face and skull fractures , and who 's still in a coma . <p> Keith . The boyish man who wrote those poems verging on over-sweetness  --  one of them ( where is it now ? ) dedicated to Susan herself . Her ironic friend , Keith , who had only enough muscles to look good on the tennis court . And now she remembers Joel was the guy who obtained a couple of tabs of acid one year , but it was Keith who insisted on cutting Susan in on the party , so they each got two-thirds of a tab . They took the acid together , with beer chasers . Forty minutes later , she decided against the experience . <p>  --  This stuff is some kind of poison , she recalls saying , and recalls the sensation , too : the brain caught in some kind of brutal vise , and the escalating conviction of utter helplessness . <p> Joel just sat there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p>  --  Wow ! he kept saying .  --  Wow , wow ! This stuff is extremely different , I would say  --  it 's got some definite zing to it ! I can positively recommend this ! <p> Then she got up to leave . <p>  --  Hey , Suze ! Keith said .  --  You are n't supposed to leave , baby , it 's against the rules , we 're supposed to stay together , you know  --  <p> But she left anyway , walking half-blinded by the weird green glow over everything , got back to her room , and lay down for a night of dreadful imprisonment , immobilized on her back , staring at the pulsating bars of light the venetian blinds cast upward on the ceiling . <p> Then the city gave Keith all the drugs he could ever want , and all the sex he 'd ever craved . I 'll be happy just getting screwed by lovely America . <p> Decades later , Susan meets again the Jewish joke that she first heard in New York , the one that ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered up at a dinner party by the French maitre a penser , Professor D. There are minor variations in detail along the way , but the outcome is identical  --  the old fellow drawing himself up in his new Bond Street suit , trying out the air of a sahib  --  and produces once more a burst of general laughter , in which Susan joins . <p> By now , she 's had much time to consider the random oddity of how things went : leaving an England stripped down to all but its territorial underwear , only to witness imperial America 's dissolving into corporate globalism . Susan imagines turning to Lili now , or Keith or Jim , but there 's no one to count on understanding how it felt , floating absently across the world while empires foundered under them .... On the other hand , she has this reassurance that , like her fellow professional aliens , she finally does get the punchline . <p> <p> By Judith Grossman <p>                 @ @ @ @
