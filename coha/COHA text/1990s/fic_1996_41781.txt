Sandalwood , Jaime whispers to himself , recalling the vendor who had sold Tony and him the three little vials of this scented oil and the five foil packets of incense . He had a makeshift stall outside the bus terminal in Dudley Square . Wearing an embroidered red and black tarboosh and an immaculately white T-shirt , on which had been silk-screened in exquisite calligraphics the simple phrase , " Life is the finest art , " he was probably in his early twenties  --  and handsome , Jaime thought now-though hard living had so weathered his face and hands , his gestures , that he looked much older . Beside Tony , however , the vendor had appeared almost a boy . His thin , dark fingertips , sallowed by the oils , the incense , cigarettes , perhaps even the plate of curried goat that sat at the edge of the display table , fanned slowly over the array of offerings , patchouli , lavender , musk , Rose of Sharon , anise , something called " Love , " something else called " Power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you like ? Sandalwood , Tony had snapped out without deliberation : It was the only scent he had ever worn . <p>  --  Whatever you do , baby , do n't forget your algebra notebook Jaime 's mother 's call rings from the kitchen , where she is preparing breakfast for his two younger sisters , Tatiana and Tasha . Having awoken early as always with his older sister , Teresita , Jaime has already wolfed down a banana and a piece of white bread with strawberry jelly for breakfast , before his mother and the girls rise , to stay out of their way . Sometimes he will drink a cup of coffee and chat with Teresita  --  whose position at the nearby springs manufacturing plant occasions her early mornings-but not this morning . He has spent the entire time since he woke , ate , and showered in reading over his poem  --  his poem  --  which his teacher and classmates , everyone , including perhaps even his mother , will all be talking about for weeks to come , and checking his equations . After proofing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly unsolvable " xy , " and came up with the only answer that allowed the equation to work : This , he tells himself , calls for a celebration , a game . <p>  --  Si , Mami , I promised you I was n't gon na forget it again . That stupid notebook , Jaime grumbles , why ca n't he forget it altogether He sits up on his bed , which he has just prepared to his mother 's former specifications ( since Tony 's death , she no longer has to scold him every morning , he now makes it instinctively ) , and opens the palm-size , amber-colored vial , one of the few personal effects of Tony 's that neither his mother nor Tony 's girlfriend had hoarded as her own . As he had observed Tony do every morning for the last few years , he places his index finger over the opening , upends it , then daubs the sweet , masculine fragrance under both ears ; again , then lightly across his collarbone ; one last time , <p> straight line from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear to the soft point of his chin . <p> This fragrance , Jaime realizes , almost smiling now , almost tearing as it takes root and blossoms in the loam of his consciousness , still lingers upon the surface of everything in the apartment : this matted wool comforter on which he sits ; on the top and corners of the particleboard dresser that he and Tony had shared ; upon even the mildewed plastic anti-slip stars plastering the bottom of the bathtub in which they had stood huddled together when they were younger , all redolent as though permanently coated . Today , for good luck 's sake , it will trail him as well , throughout the morning , on the way to school , as he stands before his class and reads his poem . <p> Done , he shakes his head as Tony would , wipes his eyes  --  no one had seen him cry at or after the funeral and will not now  --  then hides the vial under the stack of underpants in the top drawer of the dresser that has become his alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had fought over where their clothes would go How he , Jaime , had always lost and wished that he could claim the entire thing as his own  --  he feels like a blackboard from which everything has been erased , on which anything can be written . Tony . Alone , he drops onto the bed , tries to think of the day before him , the bus ride , school ... his poem . His poem , which Tony would have read with approval , maybe even awe , as he had done with the other poems , the drawings , the stories Jaime would write , sometimes off the top of his head .... <p> Silent now , he can hear beneath the floorboards his uncle , Narciso , rearranging the merchandise on the shelves of the bodega he and his aunt Marisol own and operate . Above him , their apartment slumbers . Jaime is glad to have been occupied and to not have had to help out this morning . Often his mother will send him downstairs after she has awakened the girls and begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to seek something to do , to help his uncle and aunt out , as if she owes them something for living here , especially since his father left , as if his sacrifice is her part of the bargain . Sometimes he aids in moving pieces of meat around the cold-locker and shelving newly arrived canned and boxed goods when his uncle asks him to . Undoubtedly there will be some bubble-gum box to be refilled , some soup cans to be shifted around or transformed into a stable pyramid , some moldy bread to be turned over so that the nearby loaves will mask it . This morning , however , her mind has latched completely on to that notebook . <p> Outside this room , music , laughter , the cacophony of glass against metal , voices , the television against the hour 's stillness . Tony , Jaime reminds himself , had never helped out in the store . He had gone simply from mornings and afternoons before the television and Nintendo games to the streets and a crew of similarly minded boys and couriering , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around ; his presence , at least in their eyes , and that of his boys , his chicos usually spelt trouble . It was an out to which Jaime had no recourse : Send dime down to help me out , Uncle Narciso was always saying , so I can make a man out of him , keep him out of trouble . Jaime 's mother only too eagerly assented . <p> Hoisting his backpack onto the bed , Jaime pulls out his Spanish poem to read once more , which jogs his memory : they had had to wait until nearly the end of the school to write poems , and why ? Because of the " turdles , " as he and Vinh , his classmate and best and only friend , have often laughed to themselves at lunch , though neither would dare call the mass of their classmates , even the girls , this nickname face-to-face . Despite the fact that they have occasionally had to write a paragraph , or even a short essay , they are mainly doing multiple-choice quizzes , nothing more advanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerated . As usual Mrs. Donovan has given them nine regular words and a bonus word , and this time , unlike before , she has allowed them to create a poem of at least one hundred words from these . Too simple , Vinh had cracked under his breath , against the general groans of the class ; Jaime had nodded , though he disagreed . As the lines now sing inside his head , he is sure this poem will merit an A , as will Vinh 's , which he has not yet seen . Most of the other kids , even those whose first language is Spanish , will end up with B 's or C 's , whether they hand in homework or not , since Mrs. Donovan is unwilling to embarrass anyone , even the most " slow-dropping " of the turdles , with anything lower . They had to wait almost the entire year , Jaime sighs , but now he will show them . <p> The words read , in this order : hijo ( son ) , parar ( to stop ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each ) , corazon ( heart ) , broma ( joke ) , hallar ( to come across ) , sangre ( blood ) , anochecer ( nightfall ) , and the bonus word fugaz ( brief ) . <p> Such words Vinh had said after fourth period that Mrs. Donovan had torn up a Spanish dictionary and picked the entries one by one out of a hat , but Jaime is convinced that she pulls some of them out of whatever she has been reading at home , some novel , some book of poetry , because there are always strange or unusual words , like fugaz , that are nowhere to be found in their Spanish book . He has never heard anyone , not his mother , nor Uncle Narciso nor Aunt Marisol , nor any of the Spanish speakers in the neighborhood or at church , nor even his grandmother , uncles , aunts , or cousins in Puerto Rico , ever use this bonus word fugaz even once in conversation  --  he and his sisters speak only English regularly , as did Tony  --  which for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has selected just for me . <p> As a result , he wrote ( with the translation beneath it ) : <p> Cada dia al anochecer voy esa cama y pienso sobre mi hermano muerto , Antonio Jose Barrett . Fue mi hermano solo y tuvo quince anos y medio . Yo halle la sangre y su cuerpo que estaba acostado sobre la acera como un G.I. Joe . Durante el funeral mi Mami pregunto al Dios , " ? Por que God por que mi hijo mi corazon , mi vida , mi Tony por que my baby ahora ? " Mi tio Narciso dijo toda la iglesia , " ? O Dios , mi amigos , quando la muerte va parar ? " Nadie le respondio . Desde entonce hay una cosa que yo se : en mi barrio vivir es muy fugaz y el futuro estara una broma grande . <p> Every day at nighttime I see that bed and I think about my dead brother , Antonio Jose Barrett . He was my only brother and was fifteen and a half years old . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a G.I. Joe . During the funeral my mother asked God , " How come , God , how come my son , my heart , my life , my Tony why my baby now ? " My uncle Narciso said to the whole church , " Oh God , my friends , when is the dying going to end ? " No one answered him . Since then there is one thing I know : in my neighborhood living is too brief and the future is a great big joke . <p> One hundred and eleven words he counts , and he has used the past tense correctly every time ; he has verified this twice this morning against his Spanish book . No misspellings that he can spot , and even some words they have not yet learned , but which he has gathered from regular conversations or his own reading : <p> Mrs. Donovan will have to give him an A When he recites it , she will comment on the rhymes in Spanish , on the flow , on the feeling : in her eyes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there for today ? For social studies he has his notes for his presentation on a country in West Africa . He has elected to report on Senegal , where he imagines his father 's ( and mother 's , maybe ) ancestors came from , instead of Cape Verde , his other option . Jaime shuffles his note cards in order : there are seven . He makes sure they are all there , then stores them in his backpack on top of his Spanish notebook . He has no homework ( when do they ever have homework ? ) for any of his other classes , except algebra . He glances again at the figures cleanly printed in that notebook and on the loose-lea and on which he spent two hours last night , and at least one this morning . <p> His sisters are clamoring in the kitchen , he can hear ; his mother never tells them to shut up anymore , or even slaps Tasha when she talks back as she had always done before . Jaime never talked back in the first place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( because he would not clean his room , because he sulked all through dinner , because he was switching and batting his eyes , because he reminded her too much of that black man who had left her ) but now she is always asking him what he is doing before she gets home , how he is progressing in school , what he is feeling . My son . He always lies and tells her nothing beyond the barest outline of what happens to him each day , because he is convinced she would not understand anyway , or care ; she has never understood a thing about him before in the previous thirteen and a half years of his life , nor cared , and she understood even less about Tony , whose name was always on her lips , though no longer . Tony . My heart . Nor about any of his sisters , except Tatiana , the true baby , who seems to gain her care and concern , though how long will this last , Jaime wonders , how long ? My life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairwell quietly and crosses the narrow hallway , through the double-hinged door , into the store . Quiet , empty . His uncle Narciso has obviously gone into the storeroom down in the cellar , or perhaps out into the small cold-locker in back , and Aunt Marisol has not yet come down . The shade on the front door is still drawn , and the triple-bolts have not been unlocked , nor the gratings raised and furled . <p> Jaime leans back against the wall of candy racks behind the cash register and brushes curly , raven bangs back from his forehead . In the mirror of Plexiglas surrounding the register area before him , he chances upon his reflection : the spit and image of his father  --  the eyes two new black backgammon chits ; the nose the face 's anchor , an inverted mahogany cross ; the lips as pale and swollen as two undercooked link sausages  --  whose actual face he has not seen in two years , he finds himself almost handsome , though not like Tony , who more resembled their mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jaime , is still too plump , " muy gordo . " Though no one calls him " Porcelito " anymore , since he has lost some weight over the last few months , his first cousin Nio , who had been a year ahead of him at school until he flunked out and was placed in Catholic school , has not stopped calling him " Gordon " every chance he can . At least he no longer has to hear that nickname at school , or Ninos other gem , " Chunky and Chinky , " for when he and Vinh were together . Being " gordo , " however , no one has ever expected him to be cool or popular or have a girlfriend or have juice . Those expectations fell upon Tony , who satisfied them amply , which allowed Jaime thus to be the inverse , his reverse : the " smart , " " quiet , " " artistic " one , the little chub who spends all his hours in his room , drawing , reading , writing , devising imaginary scenarios and games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , not even Nio or his mother calls him those other names , those names that had lacerated Jaime in their truth and viciousness , that had left him in tears when not driving him to fights he could not win , though no one , not even his mother , had ever dared utter them in Tony 's presence . That Tony would never tolerate , Jaime remembers , nor had he ever called Jaime those names , not even while playing , though he must have known .... Now , since Tony failed to father a little boy , he , Jaime , has become his mother 's only son , the only man in her life ... the thought sometimes makes him shudder , as now . <p> Mi hijo , corazon , mi vida . <p> Still by himself , he empties into his mouth an already-opened box of Lemon-Heads which was sitting under the register and probably belonged to Aunt Marisol , who is always munching on something sweet . At his feet he notices about six chewing-gum wrappers , which means that Aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at night , worked the closing shift : Uncle Narciso would never tolerate trash lying anywhere on this floor , so he has not yet been back behind here . Jaime gathers them up and , as he is tossing them in the wastebasket , notices the Browning Hi-Power 9mm semiautomatic , clipless , poking out from the lower shelf . Who left this thing out ? Catching no light the barrel does not flash as it normally would ; Jaime 's thoughts recoil from the cold metal . He has held this handgun before , and had held Tony 's many times ; with his toe he pushes it back onto the shelf so that it is no longer visible . <p> Before his uncle returns , he pulls the shade to peep out the front door . A small throng of people is collecting at the bus stop several feet down from the front of the store . This group of about seven people , all of them neighbors , mostly work downtown or in Cambridge , and there is a woman Jaime recognizes as one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the back of his school . Hardly anyone is milling around , as usual , so frozen are they to their spots , even at this time of year . Within seconds the bus , already half-full , screeches up . These commuters , as is customary , are pushing and shoving each other out of the way to board . Jaime 's mother always says that the Orientals push hardest because they have to claim seats first or they will never be able to muscle their way into one , that Portuguese will give up their seats if you look tired enough because they are a sad people , that the Irish usually smell like whiskey or beer so you will want to give them your seat , that the West Indians do not care how tired you look if you do not look West Indian , and that black men never give up their seats for an older woman , unless it 's their mother . But Jaime knows these kernels of maternal wisdom do not hold ; he was once knocked out of his seat by another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an older or pregnant woman , if she was black or Puerto Rican or Cape Verdean . Truth is , everyone , as Jaime knows , can be rude , mercenary , self-interested . <p>  --  ? Ai , Negrito , que ' tal ? Jaime feels the thick , spatulate fingers softly digging into his shoulders , the protuberant stomach pressing against his slope of his shoulder blades . It is his uncle Narciso . He tenses . His uncle 's breath , warm and somewhat stale , wets the hairs on the back of his neck , as his hand slips like a scarf around Jaime 's neck bone . <p>  --  Nada , Tio . Jaime turns around to face his uncle 's sloe eyes , <p> virtual mirror image of his mother , in male form . Of medium height  --  Jaime has never been able to guess heights on sight , but Narciso is taller than Tony , who was five-eight  --  and , like his mother , slender , except for the belly , Jaime comes nearly to his uncle 's forehead . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouring his forehead like a small hairbrush . <p>  --  You did n't come down this morning . Tio was waiting on you . His uncle grins , exposing a row of teeth like kernels of Indian corn . <p>  --  I was working on my algebra . I 'm failing , you know . Jaime stops against the counter . I told you that , Tio . He knows his uncle is not listening , as usual . <p>  --  Tio was waiting on you . I had a lot for you to do this morning , did n't your mother let you know ? He approaches Jaime , both his hands squirming beneath his bloody apron like two small , trapped birds . <p>  --  I was just checking to make sure the bus was on schedule . Jaime rolls his eyes , darting out of his uncle 's path , towards an aisle . I 'm gon na be late if I do n't hurry up , Tio . <p>  --  You do n't got any time left to help Tio this morning I was waiting on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clock : he has only about fifteen or twenty minutes before his bus arrives . His uncle sweeps a lock off Jaime 's forehead , reaches down , and tightly embraces him . Like always , he is mouthing something onto Jaime 's earlobe , his neck , but Jaime has long since stopped paying any attention ; he just goes slack and waits for his uncle to let go . In the back of the room , beyond the door to both the apartments and the cold-locker , he can now hear someone , probably his aunt Marisol , scuffling towards the storeroom in the cellar . Abruptly his uncle releases him , picks up the cash box at his feet , and slips behind the door that forms a clear , though somewhat rickety , protective partition around the register . <p>  --  I ' 11 help out tomorrow morning , Tio , I promise , Jaime yells out , before bounding out of the store and upstairs so as not to be late . When he reaches the top of the stairs , he hears his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call me if you was skipping class or not doing you homework , Jaime , because I do n't want you failing math again . Had she heard him come upstairs or had she just automatically launched into this ? he asks himself . His mother , splendid in her nurse 's aide 's whites , emerges from her bedroom , and now stands before him in the narrow strait of hallway between the rooms . She is frowning , blankly . <p>  --  Did you hear me ? <p>  --  Yeah , Mami , I heard you . I 'm not gon na skip algebra any more , and I did my homework , just like Mr. Morris wants . Do you want to see it ? Do you want to see my poem ? As though by default she shakes her head no ; she seldom looks at any of his homework , though she will sometimes check to make sure that he has at least packed the notebook in with the rest of his school materials , and she never looks at his other things , his other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he now keeps hidden behind his bed in a small bag that had belonged to Tony . Most of these he has shown to no one except Vinh , who draws pictures of his own , keeps similar notebooks . Vinh 's consist mostly of action figures like the X-Men or the Fantastic Four , which he copies from the comic books he collects ( Jaime collected them , too , at one point but stopped when his mother got laid off the last time ) , but he always changes all the eyes and hair so that they become Vietnamese and usually much more muscular than they appeared originally . Jaime 's , all drawn from his storehouse of memories and fantasy , usually consist of people he has seen on the bus or on the street or in the bodega , or at Downtown Crossing or in Central Square when he slips there on Saturdays or sometimes after school , and occasionally he even draws pictures of Tony , and rarely his father , though never other members of his family . Other renderings , completely from his imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , he reveals to no one . So much no one knows about him , he realizes , now that Tony is gone . <p> As they stand there wordlessly , Jaime places one hand on his hip and licks the palm of his free hand , flips back his bangs coquettishly , bats his eyes : this once provoked a reproach from his mother , but no longer . She stands before him , saying nothing , bemused as if she were looking upon someone she had never seen before in life , when his youngest sister , Tatiana , just barely five , materializes , her jumper misbuttoned and her socks mismatched , her ponytails uncoiling from beneath her barrettes . She drops in loud sobs to the floor at his mother 's feet . Jaime flees into his bedroom . <p> A glance at the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle clock  --  had he really been so into them ?  --  alerts him that he has only about five minutes to spare . He checks his backpack to ensure everything is there , including that stupid algebra notebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arithmetic work tucked into the front inside cover of the notebook ; Mr. Morris likes to receive the homework this way , so that he can verify the answers in the notebook by the preparatory work on the loose-leaf . Only for such a white turdle , Jaime notes , does everything have to be so complicated . On top of this , Mr. Morris is always pushing Jaime to do better , cornering him after class , stopping him in the hallways , calling his mother at home  --  he could easily be an A student , Ms. Barrett  --  but all those variables and commutative laws tend to drive Jaime to distraction ; he likes Spanish and Language Arts and social studies much better , since they afford him the freedom to order things  --  words , worlds , his life  --  to his satisfaction . Still , he has to admit that there is no reason he should fail algebra , because if he does , it will probably spell the death of his chances of getting into the Latin Academy , where he , with Vinh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Below the dock 's green-diode glimmer , Jaime gathers up the change off the small desk he had shared with Tony , and funnels it into his pockets . Maybe he will buy a pack of doughnuts from Uncle Narciso to eat on the way , or maybe he will save the coins for a tonic after school . Tony . It is so quiet these mornings , and evenings , too , now that Tony is no longer around , and yet Jaime no longer has to keep quiet when he wakes for fear of awaking Tony , who would be lightly snoring by now after having come in just around dawn from a long night out , probably dealing . This last year and a half Jaime would occasionally find a few dollar bills , mostly ones but occasionally a five or ten , lying in his house shoes when , still half-asleep , he climbed out of bed to go to the bathroom in the morning , and he did not even have to look across the room to realize these signified Tony was home and installed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts , which totaled about fifty-six dollars after a few withdrawals , and now keeps them tied up in a sock in the back of his drawer , for a future emergency . He has told no one about this , not even Vinh . <p> As though it were a talisman , he fingers his sock-bank , restashing it carefully , then slips on a green , plastic wristband that he had won at the West Indian Festival last summer , before zipping up his backpack and heading downstairs . <p> His mother had said nothing about his yellow T-shirt , his baggy red shorts , or his matching red hightop sneakers when she saw him earlier . Teresita would surely say he looked like a down , but she has left for work already . No one would even notice the wristband , he bets , or what the colors together represent . His keys : he pats the three of them , which hang from an extra-long shoelace beneath his shirt down into his briefs . <p>  --  Mami , I 'm going . Where is she ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head in the doorway . <p>  --  You be good and be careful , okay ? <p>  --  I will . She has Tasha in one hand and Tatiana in the other . The two girls are dressed like twins , even though Tasha is three years older . His mother is obviously on her way out as well . <p>  --  Jaime , you got your algebra notebook ? He nods yes , tapping his backpack where he thinks it is tucked away  --  because I just want you to do well , to not end up like your brother , to get out of all of this  --  then gives her a quick kiss on the cheek . <p> As he runs down the stairs , he can hear the I love you trailing his steps . <p> Through the bodega , where his aunt Marisol is now planted behind the register , chewing on a stick of gum , past his uncle Narciso , who is lifting the last of the outside grates and larks out a goodbye in Spanish and English , onto the already hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet arrived . Jaime crosses the street to his bus stop . <p> Only one other person is waiting for this bus : a young man , Corey Fuentes , who had dated Jaime 's sister Teresita . As Jaime looks up and smiles , Corey sneers in reply , then lights up his Newport . Corey is out of work , has been for about a year , Jaime has heard , but this morning he is wearing alligator loafers , nice pressed gray slacks , an ironed white shirt , and holds what appears to be a brand-new dip-on tie in his free hand , which leads Jaime to suppose that he is going in for a job interview ( very unlikely ) , traveling somewhere to meet his parole officer or some new criminal associate ( more likely but still unlikely ) , or heading downtown to make a court date ( most likely ) . Jaime does not dare inquire . <p> The spring heat has not yet fired the streets , and a breeze , almost gauzy in texture , carries pieces of trash and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Cape Verdeans , stands behind and cater-corner from them , somewhat dilapidated on the outside , with its warped grates , yellowed newspapered curtains , and its faded beer signs , unopened . To their right across the street in the distance , down near the wrought-iron fence that garters the Social Services building , a corpulent straw-haired white man , whom Jaime recognizes as Father Peter O'Hanlon , is chatting with a woman employee , unknown . So what if Fr . Pete was removed as assistant pastor of St. Stephen Protomartyr 's for spending so much time with the gangs ? Tony , Jaime remembers him saying , is not a lost cause . He will surely be in the bodega gossiping with Aunt Marisol and sipping a Coke , laced with rum , in about twenty minutes . <p>  --  Where is that fucking bus ? Corey hisses , checking his wrist graced not by a watch , but by an ornate gold bracelet . <p> He leans backbreakingly against the bus-stop sign pole . He is staring off into the distance , envisioning what ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will arrange ? Whether his new girlfriend will show up to escort him back home , on his own recognizance ? What the penalty will be for " uttering checks and credit cards " for the third time within one calendar year ? Jaime is familiar with quite a few of the court careers of other people , such as Tony , and Teresitds current boyfriend , Eric , and her ex-boyfriend Andray , so that it is not too difficult for him to figure out what this " small-time booster , " as Tony had labeled him , might be facing . <p> As he ponders Corey 's fate , his eyes trace an invisible line from the slicked , raven crown of hair to the full , pink lips to the satiny brown neck bone , which a white undershirt almost completely conceals from view . He has dreamt about Corey before . Jaime 's eyes linger on that downward slope and the cloven pectorals below , imagining them supple beneath his grasping fingers like the earth beneath the saplings that his Earth Science class spent all last month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knottier arms and the ample chest of the guy who sometimes drives Jaime 's bus route  --  Jerome  --  whose name he has inscribed on the inside back cover of the notebook he remembered to bring with him today . For a while Jaime feared his mother might see this name and interrogate him about it , but then he realized she would not touch anything of his , save perhaps that algebra notebook , under any circumstances , unless he were dead . <p> Turning and catching Jaime in his spell of appreciation , Corey glowers , murmuring ,  --  You li'l freak As Jaime looks away , unembarrassed , Fr . Pete lumbers his way up the street . <p> Another breeze is bearing up a fresh offering of debris as their bus scuds up to the curb . Corey boards first , tamping out his cigarette and tossing it over his shoulder so that it bounces off Jaime 's arm . Jaime says nothing , and hops aboard after him , perfunctorily flashing his pass as he moves into the aisle . The bus is mostly vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus driver has pulled sharply away into the street , stomping down on the accelerator , thus hurtling Jaime headfirst towards the back . Obviously , this bus driver is not Jerome , who has a velvet touch on the pedal  --  Jaime visually verifies this : No Oh , well  --  but instead Randall , who from time to time works this morning route but more often drives the Columbia Road evening route , which Jaime has taken on those occasions when he had to drop off something at his sister Tita 's job . <p> For a moment he debates whether he should sit up near Randall , whom he has never really paid much attention to , or sit in the back of the bus and write in his notebook : ? Que ' va hacer ? He decides to perch himself on the last forward-facing seat on the right side of the bus , near no one ; Corey is sitting near most of the other passengers in the forward-facing seats near the front , an unlit cigarette poling from his lips . Jaime thinks about reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazement , how Mrs. Donovan will nod her head appreciatively with theirs , how afterwards she will tell him that this is proof of what she knows he can do . He will show her his other poems , some of his drawings soon , she will write a recommendation for him , he will get into Boston Latin , he will do so well that he confirms Tony 's grandest predictions . He tries not to think about algebra at all . <p> Randall 's driving this morning is certainly a lot more jerky than Jerome 's . Extracting his writing notebook and a pencil , he sketches Randall 's face , and then Jerome 's face and torso , which he can summon from memory as sharply as if he were staring right at them , before writing beneath both pictures : " AM : RANDALL  --  Almost turdle of the bus drivers-iron foot . No Jerome this morning . Ran-dull instead ... will have to settle for second best ... not the best start , but T will make do Fugaz . What is the game for today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ path , people board , Jaime looks up periodically to see if any of them catch his eye : a few girls who were once classmates of Teresita 's or Tony 's and who are now cradling babies in their arms or in strollers ; a few teenagers his age , none at his middle school , boisterous , listening to hip-hop or dance-hall blaring from headset speakers , their backpacks rattling with drug paraphernalia , perhaps , or forties ; an old woman , dressed in a filthy white blouse and yellow shorts , a pink hairnet framing a face drooping like melting brown wax ; another older woman , white and in an appliqued blue frock , yammering excitedly to herself ; an older man , maybe forty-five , somewhere Uncle Narciso 's age , in a red and white striped polo shirt , brown polyester beltless pants , and matching brown buckled loafers . He slides into the row of seats across from Jaime and smiles . Jaime acknowledges him , almost absently . <p> Light is now flooding the bus . May sun . The fragrances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commingle in Jaime 's consciousness : he turns slowly towards the man who has a full head of graying wavy hair and an almost lacquered black mustache . The man pulls out the sports section of his newspaper and starts reading the back-page write-up of last night 's big boxing match , which Teresita and Eric and his mother had been watching on pay-per-view . My hurt . Jaime had instead been printing out his index cards , and had telephoned Vinh with a question about one of the languages in Senegal , which Vinh of course knew about . They had spoken for about twenty minutes . My love . Vinh was in the midst of doing what he spends all of his free time doing , like Jaime : reading or drawing . <p> Jaime examines the man more carefully . He must be still in his forties , because although gray salts his hair , his face does not look that old . Skinny almost , he has a complexion not unlike Jaime 's own , the color of an unshelled almond ; and thick lips , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the small triangle created by the placket of his shirt , Jaime can almost see the hairless chest . It looks like it may be toned ; the man cranes slightly forward , obscuring Jaime 's view . Jaime watches him study the scores , and draws a picture of him . What does he do all day , who is he , where is he going ? Jaime writes these questions down , in order . If I were myself , but like Tony : What would I do ? What would he do ? As Jaime scribbles , the bus stops , people board , de-board . <p> When Jaime looks out of the bus window for a change , he sees a fourteen-year-old girl he knows , named Mercedes , whom they call Dita , in front of the liquor store , stepping out of a fire engine-red Samurai with two boys , from a gang that hangs out at Four Corners . He bows his head so that he can watch her unobserved , though it is unlikely she even notices the bus 's presence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just a year ago , but since Tony 's death , Jaime has rarely seen her . One of the men wraps his arm around Dita 's waist , eases his hand down the side of her leg , slides it over onto her behind ... <p> Jaime turns back to the man , who has been staring at him . <p> The man gets up and slides in next to Jaime , who pushes his knapsack against the window . What does he do all day , who is he , where is he going ? <p>  --  Hhhiiih ... , Jaime says , his voice breathy and tremulous , like a vibrating reed . <p>  --  Hey , the man replies . How you doing this morning ? His voice is pure ice . <p>  --  Fine . <p>  --  Tha 's good , the man says , baring his straight , yellowing smile . Jaime spots the wedding band on his left ring finger , which , like all the others , is long , unwrinkled , and spoonlike . Maybe he is younger than Uncle Narciso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly examines the riders on the bus , his head angling and turning as if it were a movie camera . Jaime searches the bus for anyone who might call him out . Corey is still up front , but he is now conversing intensely with one of the young mothers . The man appears to mime placing his hand on Jaime 's knee , but does not . He simply looks down at Jaime and smiles . The teeth gleam like butter-covered knives . Jaime can feel his underarms beginning to moisten . My son . <p>  --  Where you headed ? the man asks . <p>  --  Wha 's your name ? Jaime answers . <p>  --  I like that , ' What 's your name ? ' ... My name is Vernon , what 's yours ? He lays a hand on the seatback next to Jaime 's shoulders . Jaime licks his palms and sweeps back his curls ; this man 's name can not really be Vernon , Jaime tells himself ; he must be playing a game as well . He looks out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to wherever . <p>  --  Tony . <p> - Tony ... Where you headed , Tony ? <p> - Cuffe School ... Where you headed ? <p>  --  Nowhere , I got the day off ... <p> Vernon purses his lips , then asks ,  --  Tony , why do n't we get off at the next stop ? I 'll walk you partway there . We can talk . He smiles again , as the fingers , like the petals of some exquisite brown flower , flutter out upon the seatback . Jaime inhales deeply , his mind swirling with questions : What is happening ? Who is this man ? Where are they going ? Is he going to miss algebra ? Because Mr. Morris will surely telephone his mother and admonish him in front of the class . The bus halts at the stop , and they both slip out through the back door . As the bus pulls away , Jaime reminds himself that although he has never taken a game this far , Vernon seems decent enough , and Jaime decides that , no matter what , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sidewalk flares with the morning heat . Sun glints off every metal surface in dazzling spars , forcing Jaime to put on the pair of sunglasses he keeps in the front pocket of his backpack . Vernon dons a pair , too ; where had he stored them ? At the green light , they cross the street together , walking quickly , almost in tandem , then walk several blocks up before turning into a side street , where they pause . Jaime 's hands , like Vernon 's , are pocketed . He scans the main street to see if anyone he knows is passing by . Not a soul . <p> Pointing in the direction of the projects , to their left , Vernon tells Jaime ,  --  Now , if I 'm correct , Cuffe is about six blocks that way . Jaime wrinkles his lips several times , then nods in agreement . <p> Running his hand over the lip of his pants , Vernon continues ,  --  Cuffe School , Cuffe School ... I remember when the Cuffe School first became the Cuffe School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went there , then they decided to change the name . Always do . Ca n't leave well enough alone . Ca n't say I actually know who Cuffe is , you know ... or Wendell Phillips for that matter . I guess you kids do n't care who it 's named after , though , hunh ? <p> All this talk annoys Jaime , who says nervously ,  --  No , no , nobody cares . He brushes the hair back from his forehead : Vernon is plumper than Jaime thought , or perhaps it is just that he has a gut like Uncle Narciso ; he begins to wonder if he should not just run off , end this game right now , wait till after school , another day ... What time is it anyway ? he wonders . <p>  --  Turn around so I can see how handsome you are . You are so handsome , you know ? Jaime follows the instructions , revolving in a gradual circle . Vernon now looks older than he did at first , on the bus ; the sunlight colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slack quality of the skin on his arms , like a sheet of crumpled brown plastic . He is definitely older than Tio . <p>  --  How old are you , Tony ? <p>  --  How old are you , Vernon ? <p>  --  There you go again , answering my question with another question . My age does n't matter , Tony , but I 'm forty-nine . Now , how old are you ? <p> Jaime throws his head back , closes his eyes , says casually ,  --  I 'm sixteen and a half . I got kept back a few times and I look young for my age . <p> Beginning to laugh , Vernon inspects Jaime up and down .  --  Now , Tony , I ai n't no fool . I think you 're about thirteen , maybe fourteen . Either way , this could turn into a crime in the state of Massachusetts , you know that ? Jaime remains silent , fiddling anxiously with his Day-Glo wristband , which is now primed with sweat . My heart . <p>  --  Look , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can just leave . Vernon flashes those teeth again in a furious grin .  --  Who said anything like that , about you being a liar ? We cool , ai n't we , Tony ? <p>  --  Anyways , if I did leave , where would that leave you , Jaime bats his eyes , turning his back to Vernon . This , he thinks , is not going where he thought it would , though he is unsure where that was . <p> Vernon moves closer to Jaime and rests his hand on the boy 's shoulder .  --  Why do n't we take a walk behind that old filling station there ? I knew the man who owned it , you know , Vernon whispers , his voice trailing off . Jaime reminds himself just because they go back there , nothing really has to occur . It 's a game ; he 's Tony , this man is playing along , nothing will happen . He also thinks if Tony were alive and he knew about this , he would put his gun to this man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was completely emptied so that the eyes and snot mixed into the ground like spilled soup and then stomp on the head until the face was unrecognizable . So unrecognizable that no one could figure out who he was but Jaime had known instantly , just by that scent ; instead that very thing happened to Tony and now he is lying six feet under a headstone in a cemetery in Jamaica Plain , his face shattered into a hundred pieces like a porcelain doll , his body so twisted that they could barely fit the suit on him , and no one is here to stop this game , stop it at all , save Jaime from anything , from himself ; no one cares , not his mother not his father not his aunts or uncles or sisters not Teresita not Tita not even his abuela , no one , the only one who ever cared and showed it is silent and silenced for posterity so why not see what is going to happen this morning- <p> They head down an oil-slicked gravel driveway toward the rear of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bordered on three sides by a brick wall , covered by ivy and other climbing vines . Jaime has passed by this site before , though he has never actually ventured back in here . <p> Vernon leans against the back wall of the station . He unbuckles his pants . Jaime faces him , his eyes now falling everywhere but on Vernon , who has begun to expose himself , urging the boy to approach him . Is this part of the game ? Jaime asks without rendering the words audible , fixed to his spot . What would Tony do ? His eyes still wandering , his mind leaping alternately from Vernon 's extended fingers to Tony 's veined brown hands gripping that 9mm  --  that 's what it was , was n't it , a 9mm , a Tech-Nine pulling the trigger again again again , him finding the body back behind the Dumpster behind the store like garbage dumped in the middle of the night , his mother not able to say anything at all for days , her lying on the floor beneath the pew convulsing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering in the overheated room , working himself into a frenzy at the sight of that body , that horrible corpse , that face mangled beyond recognition , beyond even hideousness , as the bed across from him lies empty empty empty- <p> Com'ere , Tony , Vernon clucks , his eyes closed and his body arched back against the wall . Jaime approaches until he is standing in front of him , stone-still . That 's good . Jaime just stands there , his eyes now fixed on Vernon 's hairless and pocked torso , paler than his face or arms , like the flesh of a plucked chicken , which he has revealed by raising his polo shirt . Jaime tenses as the hand clamps onto his shoulder . Tony Vernon is hunching over , breathing heavily . Turn around for me again , Tony Tony ? <p> Jaime , who feels himself slowly losing his sense of balance-distance-time letting everything go why ca n't he concentrate why ca n't he be a man like Tony would why ca n't he end this game end it now get closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this why is this happening he begins to turn look down find the head crumpled like a toy doll fall shoot convulsed in tears my god why my son on the floor of the pew why my God por qut when he hears ,  --  Oh , Tony ... Tony , ooooh ... <p> He opens his eyes suddenly . What time is it ? Vernon 's left hand is massaging Jaime 's shoulder , his right hand ... he feels his chest collapsing , He glimpses Vernon 's watch on his right hand ... he 's late for his algebra class He is going to miss it Jaime leaps up , stumbles backwards , knocking over his knapsack , spilling the contents upon the stones . <p>  --  Wha ? Hunh ? Vernon murmurs , writhing against the wall like a felled bird struggling to alight , riven with bliss , unaware of the boy 's actions . Panicking , Jaime snatches up his knapsack , stuffs everything back in it , hoists it onto his left shoulder , hesitates . My life , he feels rising on the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him from anything , ever , not a soul . <p>  --  Wha 's the matter , Tony ? Tony ? Jaime , refusing to look in Vernon 's direction , runs off down the driveway , his backpack now half-open and dangling from his back . In about five seconds he is onto the street that leads through the projects and into the front door of the Cuffe Middle School , pass the hall monitor who is yelling out his name  --  Jaime Barren , Jaime Barrett , Jaime ?  --  up onto the third floor , into a seat in the back of the class as Mr. Morris is chalking a series of dizzyingly elaborate equations upon the black slate that appears now as depthless as the voice that is explaining the actions of the hand and chalk , and Jaime , in the back row , is fumbling around madly in his bag , his hands searching furiously for that algebra notebook  --  where is it ? He knows he packed it , he remembers having placed it in there this morning which is nowhere to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as keenly as if it all were unreeling right before him , here : As Vernon gets ready to depart , he spots a notebook , lying several inches in front of him . A black and white wirebound gridded notebook , which has ALGEBRA I  --  MR . MORRIS , FIRST PERIOD etched across its front . Picking up the notebook , he flips through it , seeing all the red marks and the heavily annotated margins of the pages , which , like a used scratch-and-sniff sample held close to the nose , emit a faint but perceptible scent : sandalwood . He casts the notebook to the ground , beside the discarded newspaper , laughs at the folly of it all , at this boy who can not even keep up his role in their game , walks off down the driveway towards Dudley and the rest of his life- <p> His bangs now plastered like a veil to his forehead , his breathing so labored as to drown out even his own thoughts , Jaime looks up , to the puzzled expressions of Mr. Morris , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their faces are screens of bemusement , showing only the recognition of his strange and novel presence before them . Their eyes have fixed upon him as if he were the last boy on earth , their stares as blank and unrelenting as if they had never seen such a pitiful and enigmatic creature in their entire lives . <p>
