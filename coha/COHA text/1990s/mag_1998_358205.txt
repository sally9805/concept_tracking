Why , just four years ago , The Winter Olympics were a setting for scandal and controversy and tabloid headlines , all Nancy and Tonya , catty remarks and vainglorious ambition . What a difference an Olympiad makes . Now , in a near rustic city in Japan , the Games beckon once again as a refuge from the snares of the world , where the tawdry can be banished ( alas , except for commercial logos ) and where the most compelling mysteries involve the intricacies of quad jumps , clap skates , luge weight and curling . For Nagano is robed in that symbol of purity : snow , unsullied and ready for the pursuit of truth as expressed in athletic prowess . Out of mind are potential scapegoats  --  El Nino , the Asian meltdown . Of course , like all other Olympics , Nagano has its intrinsic debates , but they are sporting and professional ones for the most part or inextricable from the enterprise : the cupidity of organizers , the rebelliousness of snowboarders , and , oh yes , a feud among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should prove to be background noise . Breathe deeply . Zen is in the air . The ancient Greeks would have approved and duly declared , Let all hostilities cease , let the Games begin . <P>  --  By Howard Chua-Eoan
