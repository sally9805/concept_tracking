AFTER THE NURSE had been in , she went up to her father , in the nursing home . How many times she had climbed the stairs to his room overlooking the sea , chosen because he liked to hear the gulls and have the smell of salt . <p> He lay against the pillow with his glasses off and teeth on the locker at the side , so that she noticed his unwrinkled , soft skin . One of the few things he was proud about . <p> He turned away in a hurry , as if hiding something . <p> " Ah ... Catherine . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " I thought it was the old girl , Maguire . " <p> " What were you doing ? " <p> " Nothin ' .... Have ye bought me any ' baccy ? " <p> " You know you 're not allowed any . " <p> " Ah . . . I 'll never have a puff again . And there 's nothing to do here . " <p> " You could listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going deaf . " <p> " Read the papers then . " <p> " I hate them . The old ink comes off on me hands . Have n't you any little thing of ye own to show me ? Have ye any sketches ? " <p> He shifted around in the bed , as if he would give anything to be out of it . <p> " I forgot . I 'll bring them next time . " <p> The pad of drawings lay on her sofa in the flat , where she had just been looking at them and where she wanted them to stay , so as not to have to carry them around like old memories , rough sketches of Carson before he left . She was trying to capture those difficult dark skin tones , the places on his cheeks where his skin became almost milky , those times when his jet eyes could look fearful and sad in the same moment . She spent hours smoothing lines on the creamy thick paper , paler than skin , letting her crayon follow the grain . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could seize and capture that head as she once , had , holding it in her arms , cradling it in her arms , stroking his rough pad of hair after they made love , when she was slow and dizzy with excitement . She smoothed her index finger over his wide cheekbones , defining his face . <p> " A shame ye mother ca n't see them . " He coughed , jerking up against the sheets . " She would 've liked to . " <p> " Yes . I suppose so . " <p> The words hung between them , and he lay back with his left cheek to the pillow like a baby in a great calm with the faint bellow of the waves below . Him , her , and the waves ; this was all that was left after the summer before , when she had turned to them as a kind of refuge after the break with Carson and joined them at a cottage on the west coast of Clare . <p> She walked along the shore , up and down on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt rich as sea spray . She wanted to be alone and to find company in the rocks . In a pool there was a clump of oyster shells with their deep silver interiors like fish scales or mother-of-pearl brooches . The sea crinkled into a blister , rare for that time of year . Waves pounded and fell away with open arms . <p> " Where 've you been , dear ? " <p> Her mother came up , hot and out of breath , her face strained . She raised an arm to her hair and trails of flour caught in her curls . <p> " Wo n't you come in now for your breakfast , dear ? It 's chilly and you have n't a cardigan on . You 'll get a cold like your father . " Her voice rose and sank in the waves . <p> Catherine stayed on the rock till the wind was cold . Damnit , she would get this ridge of outcrop and the peculiar kind of light the way she wanted it . Being by the sea was exhilarating and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The demands of her mother irritated . Why could n't she go away and let her work . There must be plenty to occupy her in the house or the small village ; after all , it had been her idea to visit the place of her girlhood , seeking out old friends from over fifty years before . She had never understood her daughter 's sketching , " scribbling " as she called it , even on holiday . <p> " But I have to . To keep alert , alive to what 's around me . " <p> Her mother stopped in the midst of a field and nodded . " Yes dear , I suppose so . But ca n't you have a rest for a day or so . All that close work ca n't be good for your eyes . " <p> " I ca n't . I ca n't , " Catherine yelled . " <p> What 's that ? " <p> " Nothing . " <p> " You want to be careful . You 'll be washed away . " She patted down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Catherine rose a little from her chair . Yes , his watery gray eyes were open . <p> " You never came to see her much . " <p> " I did . " <p> " Not when she needed you . " <p> " Oh Dad ... " <p> " She asked for you at the end . You were all she had , not like her sister with the half dozen of them running around . " <p> " I was traveling . " <p> " You were always off . " <p> " I 'm back now . " <p> " You 'll be off again soon . Why did you go that long way ? " <p> " Carson ... wanted to see the part of Africa his family came from . " <p> " It 's a shame you were n't at that place when I rang , like you said you would be . " <p> " I could n't help it .... He wanted to go somewhere different . " <p> " Which one was he anyway ? " <p> " The one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ah that fella . The black one . " <p> " Dad . " <p> " Was n't it him ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " And what happened ? How is it ye did n't make a match ? " <p> " He ... went away and we ... just ... broke up . " <p> " Ah well , you 're old enough to know your own mind . We ca n't keep tabs on you anymore . " <p> And they could n't . Somehow she was never around , she knew . Last Christmas she had been in India ; Easter it had been Senegal . She spent her father 's last birthday in Mexico driving through ' scrubby villages with shacks and chickens and women in black who looked for all the world , except for their tans , as if they might have belonged in Clare or Donegal . She was always traveling from one place to another , always away at one end of the earth when she should have been at the other . Traveling and art were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both and in himself was like the two : either on the move  --  quick , agile and fleet-or quiet and at rest , totally absorbed in his work . <p> She walked through the wood yard with him in London as he told her about the varieties of wood , veneers , and grains he was considering for his next piece . He got to know the manager and had worked out good deals with him for off-cuts , odds and ends they would not sell . She liked him better this way , when he was n't working and obsessive about time and never wanting to go out . In the winter he had stayed many nights in the studio , not even going home to her , but grabbing a few hours sleep between 2:00 and 6:00 A.M. before setting to work . " Slaves , " he told her . " But different from Michelangelo . " <p> When he finished , it was he who suggested they go away . " I need to live a bit so I have something else to put into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about a week in Brittany ? " <p> " I ca n't . " <p> " Why not . " <p> " My mother . " <p> " Yeah ... " <p> " She 's not well . I have n't seen her for a while . I 'd like to go over . " <p> " You do n't usually bother . " <p> " That 's the trouble . " <p> " So ... " <p> " I ca n't come . " <p> " Why do n't you go this week when I 'm in Birmingham ? " <p> " She 'll be out of the hospital later , and that 's when she needs me . " " Go if you want to , " he added in a hurt , childlike voice . <p> " She is my mother . " <p> " OK , OK . " He strolled off into the next aisle of wood with his hands in his pockets . <p> Damn him , she thought . Why does he have to be like that , just when I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can put it off for another time . It 's only France . We can go somewhere else , somewhere really exotic . Would you like that ? " <p> They left in June for Morocco , Egypt , and Kenya . At the east coast he wanted to change their plans and go on to Silhouette Island . They had been there six days , but she would always know the one on which her father had phoned because she would never forget the day she saw the dogs . <p> Carson lay in the whiteness of the fine sand . <p> " The shoreline 's so straight . It just goes on and on , " she said . " Crazy is n't it ? " <p> He moved close . <p> " Uh-hmm . You smell nice  --  the sea . " <p> " No . Diorissima . " <p> " Oh . " <p> He encircled her with his arms , flecks of sand on his legs and the pinky brown soles of his feet . <p> " What 's the matter ? Do n't you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Why not ? " <p> " I feel ... " <p> " What ? " <p> " Nothing ... just ... not now . " <p> " Please yourself . " He rolled off . <p> An emptiness rose in her . Usually she loved the secrets and tricks his hands played on her , but that day she felt different . He stood up . " I 'm going for a walk . " <p> She watched Carson stride off , a tall dark shape like an arrow piercing the horizon . She watched , feeling as if she could not run after him . For moments afterwards , as she turned the pages of her book , it felt as if he were still there . As if he were the quietness . She looked again and there he was way out near the crush of waves , gazing out as if the future were on the horizon , one that was not with her . <p> " You 'll strain your eyes , Catherine . " <p> " I want to get this before it changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her shoulder . She took off her glasses . <p> " What is it ? " <p> " A man . " <p> " Oh ... What part of him is it ? He has no eyes . " <p> " His back . " <p> " He 's a big bulk of a fella and is n't it dark ? " <p> She looked up to see her mother weave from side to side . <p> " Ma , are you all right ? " <p> " I 'll just sit down . " <p> " What 's wrong ? " <p> " I do n't know . The heat , I expect . There has n't been a good summer like this in years . " She fell exhausted into a chair holding her glasses in her hand . Frayed and tired , her skin was thin and loose . In that instant Catherine wanted to hold her , hug her into rejuvenation , make her into the woman she had known growing up  --  strong , resilient , constant as the stars . <p> " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes Ma . That 's the best thing . " She held her round the waist and took her upstairs , going slowly so that she did not falter , until she stopped . <p> " But your father will be back at lunchtime and he 'll want something . " <p> " Never mind . Lie down while you have the chance . " <p> " I must get him a sandwich . " <p> " He can do that . " <p> " No he ca n't . He could never manage without me , " <p> " You 've spoilt him over the years . " <p> " I have . But what 's the use of thinking on it now . He 's a good man and he likes his food . Where was I ? " <p> " You were saying you would lie down . Come on . " <p> Catherine got her into the room and on top of the eiderdown , so that her once pretty face was now paintfully visible with all its strains and creases . <p> " I wish ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were married ... settled down . " <p> " God , do n't start that again . " <p> " What Dear ? " <p> " I 'd like to be . It just has n't happened , that 's all . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " Are you all right ? " She was trying to get up from the bed , the hem of her dress rising to show the tops of her stockings and her pink slip . <p> " Call me if he comes in . " <p> Catherine sat by the bed for a few minutes while her mother settled . <p> Her hair was thinner and her dress sagged around her waist where it had once fallen from a full bosom . Her breath barely audible as she slept , she moved ever so slightly as if in a difficult dream . <p> " Catherine ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Ah you 're there . " <p> " Of course . How do you feel ? " <p> " I 've still the pain . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Are ye sure ? " <p> " It 's only the wind . " <p> " I feel as if this place will be blown away . " <p> " Of course not , how could it ? " <p> " Did n't they have hurricanes in America last year ? " <p> " They always do . " <p> " Ah but those ones were worse than ever . Those poor people having their homes swept away . In the end that 's all a person has : her home . " <p> On the white beach of the island a yelp broke the silence . A lean gray dog trotted up to another straggly black-haired one a few yards ahead of her . <p> Glaring . A shift from foot to foot . The dark one moved in , glassy-eyed with deep brown fear . His stocky legs slipped and collapsed . The gray dog leapt on to his back . Catherine watched in strange fascination . The gray dog 's paws strangled his opponent . He gripped its sides , hurling himself over with spirited kicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and feet . Ears sharpening . Blood trickled down the leg of the black dog . The gray one ran off up the beach into stray grasses . <p> Catherine felt sick seeing the short dog stumbling away , dragging its leg behind , the thick of it splashed with scarlet spots . She wanted to rush and pick it up but knew it was no good . It trailed back to the main road . <p> When it was out of sight she sat waiting for Carson to come back . He seemed brighter and she was pleased . <p> " Are you all right ? " he asked . " Not sick ? " <p> " No , I was just ... thinking about my mother . How time passes . " <p> " You worry about her too much . There 's no point . She 's had her life , now you 've got yours . Just live it . I 'm sorry about earlier on . I was a bit of an asshole . Do you want to go in now ? " <p> So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she wanted to hold him close for hours . Alarmed with the sense of loss , with lingering images of the dogs ' violence , she hungered for and consumed his comfort . <p> But when they got home to a rainy November he mouched around the flat for hours . " This place is too quiet . I need a buzz . Might go stateside . Find out the scene there . " <p> " Go to America ? " <p> " Yes . Are n't you gon na come ? Or do you like being cooped up in this chicken run of a city ? " <p> " I ca n't just get up and go . It 's too far . And I 'd have no job . I know I do n't earn much at the college teaching , but at least it 's money coming in . " <p> " But this place is so drab . And look at the weather . You could easily find a job . We could go skiing in Vermont . I 've got friends there . And San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a house . " <p> " It 's not as easy as that . At least not for me . " <p> " OK . Let 's discuss it later . We can arrange something . " <p> They talked and they talked for hours in the flat , staying up late at night while the rest of the city slept and there were just pinpoints of streetlights for company in the rows of terraced houses . <p> He went to New York on business . He went again and came back . The third time it was for good . He phoned once but did n't write . In the growing weeks everything between them was as wide as the Atlantic . <p> " Are you there ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Martha ? " <p> " It 's me , Dad . " <p> " Ah , is there a cup of water ? " <p> " Here . " She helped him up onto the pillows . Frail wisps of his hair shimmered . He drank before falling back to sleep with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the back of his locker , ruffling up the lacy doily under the vase of daffodils . The nurse would have done that , just as her mother had years ago . <p> He slept with easy breaths , his face familiar yet different , the sagging neck like a chicken 's . She went over to the large window , careful not to wake him . Three boys were kicking a ball and she remembered Carson had liked football and often went to matches , though he had n't during the time she knew him . Perhaps , she thought , he liked me better . And now it 's probably baseball . She wondered how he was , how successful he had become  --  it was either exceedingly or very . He would not have let any opportunities slip from his grasp . <p> A woman walked with a dog across the beach . Her headscarf fluttered in the wind . Catherine thought how she could have used this scene if she had her pad . She could have sketched this woman . She realized how few she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous year , right after the break with Carson . <p> " You 're still there ? " <p> She turned away from the window . " Yes . " <p> " What time is it ? Have you a watch ? " <p> " Ten to four . " <p> " Ah , she 'll be on with the tea . She makes me drink it , though it 's terrible weak . " <p> " I 've got to be going now , Dad . " <p> " You 'll be along tomorrow ? " <p> " Of course . " <p> " Would you get me a little thing ? " <p> " How little ? " <p> " Some Players . " <p> " I certainly wo n't . If Nurse Maguire catches you , or I do ... " <p> " It was n't anything . Just a thought . " <p> " Well you can forget it , Dad . " <p> She bent to kiss him on the forehead . The old devil , she thought . Trying to kill himself . Run out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went downstairs . Each step resounded like the waves , and she thought of her mother standing on the rough part of the beach . You ca n't hang on to anyone , not in thoughts , or scents , or sketches . You have to let go , or they go . They evade . Sometimes a brooch is left , old jewelery passed down , or a few blues records  --  but nothing real , nothing you can carry or hold on to . " Washed away , washed away " echoed in her head , in the tone of her mother 's voice in prayer at one of her evening rosaries : an invocation to the beach , to all the beaches she had ever known , from there to Silhouette Island . <p> <p> By DEIRDRE SHANAHAN <p>
