TITLE : TRUE ROMANCE <P> DIRECTOR : TONY SCOTT <P> WRITER : QUENTIN TARANTINO <P> THE BOTTOM LINE : And Bonnie and Clyde go to L.A. : this corpse opera takes the low road , but with high craft . <P> If shoot-'em-up , gobble-'em-down movies like The Fugitive and Jurassic Park are rated PG-13 these days , what does an R-rated action adventure look like ? Like True Romance : violent to a fault , glam to the max . <P> Writer Quentin Tarantino ( Reservoir Dogs ) and director Tony Scott ( Top Gun , Beverly Hills Cop II ) must have figured : If we 're gon na get an R , then dammit , let 's make an R. For a while , True Romance had the restrictive NC-17 rating , and there 's still enough carnage in the R version to make an audience wince out loud . A white drug dealer perforates some black thugs . Palms get sliced , feet corkscrewed , skulls smashed with toilet-tank lids , eyes and other essential organs blown out . The movie climaxes with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lowest form of slime mold , a movie producer  --  edgily pointing heavy artillery at one another . <P> Only the most desperate scavengers would trawl for a story line in this swamp of sensation , but here goes . Clarence ( Christian Slater ) works in a Detroit comic-book store . It 's his birthday , and as a present his boss has bought him a surprise call girl , Alabama ( Patricia Arquette ) . She may vaguely aspire to be Melanie Griffith , and if Clarence hopes to travel abroad , it is only because he " always wanted to see what TV in other countries looked like " ; but this is true romance . The two must marry , run into some mortal trouble ( Gary Oldman as a drug dealer , Christopher Walken as a Mafia don ) and flee  --  with the surprise package of a suitcase full of cocaine  --  to Los Angeles . Their moral code is hardly more righteous than that of their pursuers , but they 're on their way , down a white-brick road toward the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . <P> If you believe for a moment that True Romance is a character study , you must be one of the actors in it . For the audience it 's a vivid exercise in style . Or more precisely , an exercise in fashion . Scott made his name directing British TV spots ; he can make each image yummy , seductive , good enough to buy , whether the scene is selling sex , violence or some slick sociopathic blend of the two . He pummels your eye with wide-screen close-ups that eroticize violence and give a lurid threat to the sex . The love scene is a French- kissin ' , torso-lickin ' jeans ad set to cinema . In the big shoot-out at the end , bloody cushion feathers smother the screen in slo-mo . <P> The performers , especially Walken , Oldman and Saul Rubinek as the producer , do everything in big-mo . In its acting as well as its writing and direction , this is a live-action cartoon , a fantasy ( and a sidewise critique ) of machismo . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole enterprise is noisy as hell , but you know it 's there .
