The Rev. Jerry Falwell last week suggested that Tinky Winky , the purple Teletubby , is gay . Falwell 's rationale : purple is the color of gay pride ; Tinky Winky 's antenna is a triangle , the symbol of gay pride ; and he carries a bag . Mystifyingly , Falwell was a no-show at the International Toy Fair , the biggest toy market in the western hemisphere . If he had gone , he could have found things to worry about into the next millennium , including : <P> TUSH : Its manufacturers claim its large bottom makes it perfect to rest one 's head on , but is n't it really designed to encourage interspecies dating ? <P> LEGO STAR WARS FIGURES : Movie spin-off , says Lego . But Jerry would see the truth : the Force is a cult . <P> WATERBELLIES : Plush creatures with snow globes in their bellies or poor role models ? They 're clearly pregnant , yet they appear to be unmarried . <P> ICE MAN : You put him together , pour water over him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scalpels , and pull out his guts . If that does n't encourage belief in immortal life through cryogenics , what does ? <P> THE ULTIMATE SOLDIER : His removable head may make him more adaptable and fun for role play . But Jerry would immediately see the subtle reference to The Exorcist.
