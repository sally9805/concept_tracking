I was walking along Vancouver 's Kitsilano Beach last summer when a young woman came running from the washroom , screaming that someone had taken her baby . A lifeguard was able to calm her and the boy was found a few metres away playing on a swing . I understood her fear . When my son , Mark , was a small baby , I worried about black-market kidnappers ; now it 's child pornography rings and murderous pedophiles . When we are out I clutch his hand in case he is nabbed from the street or in the mall . Of course , part of me knows these fears are irrational , because child abduction by a stranger is actually very rare . According to the RCMP 's Missing Children 's Registry in Ottawa , there were about 52,000 reported cases of missing children in 1994 , but most were runaways . In fact , less than one percent of all missing children are abducted and the overwhelming majority of abduction are by non-custodial parents . Still , while Mark has a much greater chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know that sexual predators are real , that children wander off and that bullies are a part of life . And I know that the best way to protect my child is to teach him the skills to protect himself . The traditional approach to streetproofing tells me I should teach my happy , trusting toddler not to talk to strangers , to run and scream if he is approached by anyone he does n't know . I should also tell him that no one can touch his private parts , even though he still has no concept of privacy . But a growing number of educators , child development experts and parents are saying there is a more effective way to streetproof . Confident children with strong self-esteem can be taught to trust their instincts and develop the decision-making abilities needed when they have to protect themselves . Some , like Vancouver parenting educator Kathy Lynn , warn that telling children not to talk to strangers can make them paranoid and fearful , and can even be dangerous . In January 1993 , three-year-old Shae Bourquin of Abbotsford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around midnight he decided to pack up his clothes , and without telling anyone , head for home  --  about ten blocks away . Shae managed to drag his sports bag about two houses away when he was found by a female neighbour . But Shae had been told not to talk to strangers and when he refused to open his mouth the neighbour called the police . Shae still refused to give his name . Now that 's outrageous , " says Lynn . " We 've got kids so scared they ca n't go for help . And it caused the adults involved unnecessary grief because the police could n't get in touch with them his parents and at three he probably knew his name  --  enough to give information . He should have been able to say " I 'm lost . ' ' " Meg Hickling , a sexual health educator in Vancouver , says telling our kids not to talk to strangers simply does n't work . " The greatest tragedy about abuse and abuse prevention is that we focus so much on strangers when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or people they know from other activities , " she says . " So when you go into this great song and dance about not talking to strangers , it 's a useless exercise . All you do is make a child more paranoid about the world . Children see their parents talking to strangers all the time . In fact if you ask a little child what strangers look like they often will tell you they 've got fangs and horns and they wear black capes . They really do n't even understand the term " stranger . ' ' " But children must still be taught that an adult does not need to ask a child for help , and that it is OK to say no to an adult who makes them feel uncomfortable . Says Lynn : " I like to teach kids that most people are good and a few people are n't , and if you do n't feel good about a person , take off . " It 's important for children to understand that a stranger is anyone they do n't know well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , or the school crossing guard . Explain that if you do n't know a person 's full name or where he lives or anything about him , he is a stranger , even though you might see him every day . While we spend an inordinate amount of time worrying about stranger abduction , the next thing we fear most is sexual abuse . And because most abusers are people our children know , we are constantly told to instill in our kids rules such as " Do n't let anyone touch your private parts . " Hickling says we spend far too much time on privacy and not enough time teaching youngsters to be at ease with their bodies . " To give your children permission to look at their bodies and talk about them to find out how they work , that could be the greatest gift you give , " she says . " One of the problems that we have with the anti-abuse programs is that they over-privatize the body so that the children are frightenedto even look for themselves or report any sores or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the body that you simply do not touch , look at or talk about . " Adds Lynn : " What we need to be doing right from the time that our children are very young is trust their instincts and allow them to take the lead sometimes . What I mean by that is do n't make children touch another person who they do n't want to touch . Do n't make them kiss creepy Uncle Alvin , because what we do is take away their internal antennae and if we do n't destroy that , then they will have good instincts . " Birgit Schinke , of North Vancouver , has a daughter , nine , and a son , 13 . She says that spending the time to develop their self-esteem by listening to them and letting them make their own choices has turned them into assertive , independent and confident children , able to trust their instincts . " They have a certain amount of control over their lives , so if some stranger approached them with something weird , they would know immediately and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't sit up one morning and say now my child knows how to deal with strangers  --  it 's a process  --  but I would say by about five or six my kids were pretty with it . " From the time her children could talk , Schinke helped them to trust their feelings . " So many kids , if they say " I 'm upset " or " I 'm embarrassed " are told by adults " No , you 're not " or " Do n't be silly , " " she observes . " I would never invalidate their feelings , because all that says to them is what you 're feeling is wrong and you stop listening to that gut feeling , and that 's what makes people vulnerable . " Five years ago , Schinke belonged to a babysitting co-op . " There was a man in the co-op and neither of the kids wanted him around and I just respected it even though I might have lost a night of babysitting . Nothing weird had happened , it was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't force them to spend time with him . " Schinke says she did n't teach them assertiveness , she modelled it , and never hesitated to stand up to another adult whom she felt was out of line with her kids . " If there is another adult around who tries to talk to my children through me , I 'll say they are right here , talk to them yourself . Waitresses often ask me what my children want to eat . I just say : Ask them . I think there 's a lot of abuse of power between adults and children , so I 've always tried , whenever I could , togive them the sense that they have power , too . " The confident , secure child , Schinke and many others believe , is the streetproofed child . Figure not transcribed Consult original publication The Power of " NO " What I remember most about Uncle Abe is that I never liked him . An image from my childhood haunts me . I see my little sister , Mary-Lou , and myself in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden cross hangs on the arch . Uncle Abe is exposing himself . Through the door I can see Aunt Mary in the kitchen .... Looking back through photographs I recognize the little blue hat that Mary-Lou was wearing . She was two years old and I was three . Uncle Abe liked to tickle children in their private places . I remember clearly a family get-together when I was six , where he tried to tickle my crotch through my pants . I told him to get lost , that I would tell my mother . I had an advantage over my cousins : my mother had empowered me , she 'd talked to me about people like him . " Do n't touch me , " I said , my message clear . I always assumed that everyone else did the same . Some 25 years later I discovered this assumption was very , very wrong . When a family member disclosed that Uncle Abe had molested her , she gave others the courage to finally speak out . Two generations of children had , in silence , suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was the phrase heard most often from many of the older relatives . They did n't know how to react or what to do . " Excuse me , " I said , " has he acknowledged he did something wrong ? Has he asked to be forgiven ? " I suggested that if he wanted to make amends he should go to the police and turn himself in . He , of course , did not . In fact , he said he did n't think he 'd done anything wrong . If only someone had told me that I could just say no , " said a woman I talked to recently . So much power in one tiny word . Talk to your children , listen to them , believe in them , teach them about touching , and give them permission to say , " No . " Do n't stereotype the pedophile as a stranger because most often the person who molests a child is someone the child knows . If your child does n't seem to like a particular person , find out why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; do n't wait until you 're sure . Never think that a molester 's approach is an isolated incident  --  it is probably one of many . Talk about it , because it is only through the telling that victims recognize they do n't have to keep the secret , they are not alone . Streetproofing Stages To Age Three : We can start building children 's self-esteem and laying the foundations for streetproofing from the time they are very young . Dr. Linda Eaves , a developmental psychologist at Sunny Hill Hospital for Children in Vancouver , says children 's self-esteem can not be taught , but we can help develop it early in parenting by " paying attention when they are crying , filling their basic needs when they are tiny , and giving them lots of smiles and approval . " Parenting educator Kathy Lynn says we can give little ones a sense of control over their bodies by not letting anyone pick them up unless they want to be picked up . " People are always swooping in on babies and that 's when you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you when she 's ready , ' and right away you are giving this child a message that she has control . " Lynn says do n't force kids to hug or kiss anyone . Give them permission to say no . While nothing replaces direct adult supervision for a child under three , a toddler who is lost will need to approach a stranger for help and we can start teaching our children what to do should this happen . " The message I would give to kids would be to go to a police officer or a store clerk  --  somebody that they see who either works in the place where they are or seems to be in charge , " says Lynn . " The point is if we teach our children that young to know that , frankly , most adults can be trusted , then they are more likely to go for help quickly . " Three to Five : A child who is told who to like , what to eat and what to wear , will not learn to make decisions or exercise good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child inconsequential choices  --  whether to have an apple or a banana , for instance , and ask him to live with the results of those choices . This is also the age when kids can learn their full name , address and phone number . Says Eaves : " Start trying it at three and if they catch on to it then good , but if they do n't , put it away for a month and try again . But certainly by five they should be able to answer questions about themselves correctly . " Explain that a last name is something that everybody in the family has , and a phone number is a way of reaching homeif you are lost or in an emergency . For kids who are tactile , Lynn suggests putting magnetic numbers on the fridge so they can touch and look at them . Others may learn through singing and others by punching or dialling a number on a toy phone . One mother asked the telephone company for a number that would be easy for her children to remember . Put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dial 911 in an emergency . This is also a good age to begin preparing your children for the independence that they will soon demand . While you walk around your neighbourhood point out Block Parent homes , homes of friends and other places your child can go to for help . Lynn says the local pharmacist who administers everybody 's prescriptions is a good source for children in her community because he knows who everybody is and has all their phone numbers . You can also point out unsafe areas in the neighbourhood , such as dark alleys , vacant blocks and empty buildings . Six and Up : As children can remember more , teach them the area code , how to use a pay phone , how to reach an operator , and how to make a collect call . It 's also the time when we have to start letting go . " Once you 've taught them what they need to know you have to let them go , but letting them go is a process , " Lynn observes . She suggests that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact the school and find out which other kids live nearby , go and meet the parents and see if you can set up a buddy system . We tend to inundate kids with rules like " do n't talk to strangers , " which they often apply universally or forget altogether . Lynn says the message we should be teaching our children is when anything or anybody makes you uncomfortable go to an adult who you trust : " It really is that simple , whether it 's a teacher or a police officer or a neighbour . Just find another adult quickly . " Eaves suggests playing " what if " games and role-playing as a way of practising and rehearsing information . Ask your child : " What would you do if a friendly man asked you to help him find a lost puppy ? Or offered you a candy ? " There are no wrong answers , just better choices .
