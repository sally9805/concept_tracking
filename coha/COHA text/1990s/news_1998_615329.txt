<p> Alice Walker , a tireless activist and self-styled seeker , has found a new passion : being a homebody . At age 54 , the small , soft-spoken author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning " The Color Purple " is making no new promises to read or lecture . " I 'm just interested in going home , " Walker says . " In being there . In just being . " <p> Six years after her provocative novel " Possessing the Secret of Joy , " about the ancient rite of female circumcision , Walker , a native of Eatonton who lives now in northern California , is on tour promoting a new novel . " By the Light of My Father 's Smile " is the story of an African-American family  --  two daughters and their parents  --  who settle in the remote Sierras of Mexico for several years to study a mixed-race tribe of Indians and blacks called the Mundo . When the 15-year-old daughter becomes sexually involved with a Mundo boy , her father beats her in a scene witnessed by her sister . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrates much of the novel posthumously , watching his daughters from an otherworldly perch . <p> As in most of Walker 's work , there is much spirituality , a laundry list of causes the author believes in , a touch of redemption and a lot of explicit sex . On a recent stop to read and sign books at Emory University , Walker talked with Atlanta Journal-Constitution book editor Teresa Weaver . <p> Q : Do you care about reviews ? Do you read them ? <p> A : Not while I 'm on tour . I do n't want to take the chance that they are going to bother me . <p> Q : What drives you ? Is it a desire to write or a desire to spread a particular message ? <p> A : It 's really a curiosity about the world , and a lot of love for people . And some feeling of responsibility for the younger generations of people , and also for the natural world . <p> Q : In a recent interview in Ms. magazine , you refer to yourself as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : Well , an elder is someone who begins to operate from a sense of responsibility for the collective rather than just responsibility for themselves . You can be 10 and be an elder . It 's about responsibility rather than about age . Although , as I was saying in that Ms. article , in ancient Cherokee tradition you become an adult when you 're 52  --  because generally by that age you 've raised your children , you 're independent , and you are an adult . Then you 're required to speak about the issues of the day . I feel like I 'm between that stage and the elder stage . <p> Q : There 's a strong spiritual element in much of your work . Does organized religion play a role in your life ? <p> A : I have been fleeing from organized religion since I was 13 because I could see that it was at war with nature . And I always felt that nature was my true ally . Fortunately , our church was too poor to have stained glass windows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people have churches with " beautiful " stained glass windows , but basically the function is to keep you from being aware of how much more grand nature is than whatever is inside the church . <p> Q : Are you a practicing Buddhist ? <p> A : No . I studied Buddhism because it has some really , really amazing features that are very helpful in getting through terrible times in one 's life . <p> Q : Do you meditate ? <p> A : Yes , I do . I 've been meditating since I was divorced , over 20 years ago . . . . The latest is Tibetan . The teaching is called Lojong , and the meditation practice is called Tonglen . It 's a practice of breathing in pain and suffering , and breathing out what you 'd rather there be . <p> Q : Tell me about your writing process . Is there a routine ? <p> A : I 've never had a routine . . . . For me , it 's more about being in rhythm with my own growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The discipline is not to overtax it . <p> Q : What contemporary authors do you read ? <p> A : I really love Clarissa Pinkola Estes ' work . She wrote " Women Who Run With the Wolves . " I think she 's an extraordinary storyteller and healer , and she 's dealing with issues of such major soul importance . . . . I find her to be the one indispensable contemporary author . <p> Q : Let 's talk about your latest work . The father-daughter dynamic is central to the story . Can you talk about your relationship with your father ? <p> A : No . No , I 'm not interested in talking about my father , but I can talk about father-daughter relationships . That goes back really to my earlier novel , " Possessing the Secret of Joy . " Because when I really understood how debased and really destroyed female sexuality is at that end of the spectrum of oppression . . . I started to understand that this is an area that is so imperiled , we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how to counterbalance such practices , it was very clear that we would have to deeply involve fathers in the affirmation of their daughters ' sexuality . <p> Q : How autobiographical is your work ? <p> A : I think everything a writer writes is autobiographical , even if you write about a table , because it comes from you . The fiction is generally fiction , and the essays are generally essays , but since it 's all coming from me , it is autobiographical . I am the garden from which all of this grows . <p> Q : You are frequently banned from school libraries because of the subject matter and the graphic nature of what you write about . Does that bother you ? Or does it incite you ? <p> A : It 's not really about the graphic nature . Two of my books , for instance , were banned in California schools , and one was about a horse , and the other one was about a Christian woman marrying a Muslim man . They said one was anti-meat-eating , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other was anti-religion , since the woman before her wedding questioned the nature of religion . See , it 's not always about graphic nature . It 's about control . Control of many kinds of information . But you know , that 's their problem . <p> Q : Where do the ideas for your novels come from ? Say , with " Possessing the Secret of Joy , " do you come up with an issue that you want to address and build the fiction around it ? <p> A : I had heard about that practice ( of female circumcision ) long before I wrote " Possessing the Secret of Joy . " . . . Frankly , I do n't know how you can live with certain issues . It took me years and years and years to learn how to deal with it in such a way that people would n't just run screaming from the room  --  or leap right into the biggest , fattest denial . I understood I had to create an object that people could approach , open up and peek into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took that book around the country , everywhere I went , women fainted as I read . <p> Q : In the end , did that book accomplish what you wanted ? <p> A : Absolutely . It started it . Now there are laws . . . and people are talking about it . I think writing very forthrightly about sexuality encourages people to see it as enlightenment , not as evil , reminding them that they need n't be hobbled by a tradition that is detrimental to women and to children . They do n't have to believe that Eve did anything wrong just because she was curious . <p> Q : You 've said that it is the father 's responsibility to help daughters establish their sexual identity . Does the mother not play a role ? <p> A : Oh , of course . But you know , mothers are there . Although often they do n't share much information . My mother did n't start talking to me about sex until after I was married and had a baby . And I thought : Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? Now I 've figured it out . . . . <p> But I think because the father has been set up as the watchdog over the daughters ' sexuality , it 's very important that we go directly to the father consciousness . What is a father ? What does it mean to be a father of a pubescent girl ? I think so many men have no idea . They have no idea . They have run off to the football game and the corner store . . . . Meanwhile , these little girls  --  who up until this point have been Daddy 's darlings  --  start falling behind . <p> Q : Do you believe in angels ? <p> A : Spirit is more like it for me . I think the spirits of our ancestors are quite present if we 're open to that . As in the Mundo world , I think it 's the spirits that come back and take care of people . As for myself , I have always felt very supported by ancestral spirits . <p> Q : Besides meditating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a lot of walking and a lot of gardening . You know , just stuff . <p> Q : You 've been an activist since your college days . Are there particular pet causes now ? <p> A : No , actually I 'm more interested in being home right now . . . . I love being at home . I think more people should stay home . <p> Q : You 've said you 're going to cut back on interviews and lectures . Is that temporary ? <p> A : I do n't know . Life is a river , and it keeps on going . There 's no way of knowing what 's coming up . <p> Q : Are you working on any new projects ? <p> A : Getting through this book tour is my only project right now ! I am not looking ahead at all . One of the practices that I love about Buddhism is that it reinforces our instinct to live in the present . There 's no future , no past . You 're just right there . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans . <p> Q : Are there any film projects under way involving your work ? <p> A : Actually , something kind of interesting is the possibility of making " The Color Purple " into a musical for Broadway . And some producer is interested in making a film of ( " By the Light of My Father 's Smile " ) . <p> Q : So are there any taboos left for you to break ? A : You know , I hope not . Because it takes a lot out of you .
