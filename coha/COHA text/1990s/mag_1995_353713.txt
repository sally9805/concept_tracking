College professors as a rule do not lead swashbuckling lives . But some 50 or 60 of them last week were given a chance to help in the pursuit of the nation 's most wanted serial killer . The FBI gave them copies of the notorious Unabomber 's 35,000-word screed against technology , the same document the terrorist mailed on June 24 to the New York Times , the Washington Post and Penthouse ( which had previously offered to publish it ) . Since then , both papers have been fretting over the bargain the Unabomber proposed : publish the tract in toto within three months  --  and promise to make space available afterward when requested  --  and he will stop sending the lethal package bombs that have killed three and wounded 23 over the past 17 years . Penthouse publisher Bob Guccione , meanwhile , took out a whiny full-page ad in the New York Times last week to convince the Unabomber that publication in Penthouse is a respectable alternative  --  and to offer the bomber a regular column . <P> The FBI 's decision to enlist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excerpts of Unabomber prose , treating the document as an item in the news . That approach seems unlikely to mollify the terrorist  --  but it did provide the public with its first real exposure to his philosophy , which seems to prove a point made by Alexander Pope more than two centuries ago : " A little learning is a dangerous thing . " <P> The excerpts from " Industrial Society and Its Future " bear the stamp of an earnest thinker who has reinvented the wheel and wonders why nobody is paying attention . Modern life is hard , the Unabomber announces : " The moral code of our society is so demanding that no one can think , feel and act in a completely moral way . For example , we are not supposed to hate anyone , yet almost everybody hates somebody at some time or other , whether he admits it to himself or not . " Why are things so fouled up ? " The industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race . " <P> The Unabomber , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts alone , complains that freedom of the press is a sham : " If we had never done anything violent and had submitted the present writings to a publisher , they probably would not have been accepted . " Hence the Unabomber 's murderous logic : " In order to get our message before the public with some chance of making a lasting impression , we 've had to kill people . " <P> On the evidence of the excerpts , the Unabomber is a rather bland but careful writer , fastidious about his grammar ; " to be able personally to influence " is his somewhat labored way of avoiding a split infinitive . In another passage , lambasting white liberals who champion black culture , he writes , " But in what does this preservation of African-American culture consist ? It can hardly consist in anything more than eating black-style food ... " <P> The FBI is hoping that one of the professors who read the manuscript will remember a former student who used " consist in " when he meant " consist of , " or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Unabomber 's unmasking . Mathematical code breaking is a far more precise science than detective work on language . But writing in sufficient samples does betray unique characteristics , including vocabulary range , repeated sentence structures and preferred figures of speech .
