The formidably confident Mikhail Gorbachev showed a touch of meekness when the Norwegian ambassador called on him last week . " He came very gently toward us and asked if he could really believe the rumors , " Dagfinn Stenseth recalled . " I told him if he was thinking of the Nobel Peace Prize , he could . " A smiling Gorbachev later said that he was " deeply moved and excited " and that the honor would provide " support and inspiration " at a critical time in his reform efforts . <P> Nobel awards have not always been so well received in Moscow . The only other Soviet Peace Prize laureate was the physicist and human-rights activist Andrei Sakharov , who was honored in 1975 . One Soviet newspaper called that award " political pornography , " and a statement by 72 of Sakharov 's colleagues in the Soviet Academy of Sciences accused him of activities " aimed to undermine peace . " The government refused to let him travel to Oslo for the ceremony , but his wife Yelena Bonner attended for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When Boris Pasternak , author of Doctor Zhivago , was named in 1958 , the official press labeled the decision " a hostile political act . " The vilification became so intense that Pasternak declined the prize . He died in 1960 , and his son claimed the medal on his behalf only last year . <P> One of the Kremlin 's least favorite writers , Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn , won the literature award in 1970 . He decided he would not attend the presentation for fear of being refused permission to return home . He was probably correct : four years later he was exiled from the Soviet Union . Soviet-born poet Joseph Brodsky was already in exile in New York City when he won the prize for literature in 1987 . Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennadi Gerasimov thought it was " a good thing " that world attention would be focused on Russian poetry , but he was sour about Brodsky , who had been sentenced to a work camp in 1963 for the crime of " parasitism . " " The tastes of the Nobel Committee are strange sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement , one Nobel selection that warmed the Kremlin 's heart was that of Mikhail Sholokhov , the court novelist who received the Literature Prize in 1965 . He was allowed to go to Stockholm and deposit his check in a bank there . But in 1974 the exiled Solzhenitsyn accused Sholokhov of plagiarism . He claimed Sholokhov had based portions of his epic of the Russian Revolution and civil war , The Quiet Don , on a manuscript written just after World War I by a Cossack , Fyodor Kryukov . <P> Thanks to increases and an improved exchange rate for the Norwegian krone , the prize is worth about $710,000 , or about eight times Gorbachev 's annual salary . It is a sum that would see any Soviet citizen through a lifetime of shortages , but the President plans to donate the money to charity . One likely recipient : a fund for young victims of the Chernobyl disaster .
