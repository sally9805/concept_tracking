A small but growing-and vocal-number of African-Americans are demanding reparations our more than 300 years of unpaid labor in building this nation . If the equivalent of 40 acres and a mule went to every descendant of slaves-or every Black person living amidst slavery 's legacy-would the scales of justice be balanced ? In this ESSENCE Dialogue , two civilrights advocates consider this question and discuss the new moral economy around the world that is spurring such a discussion . Dr. Mary Frances Berry , an attorney and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania , is the chairperson of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights , appointed by President Clinton . Attorney Stanley Mark is the program director for the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund . // ESSENCE : What are reparations ? Stanley Mark : Historically , when massive injustices are committed against a group of people because of race or national origin , the society 's institutions should make restitution to the people who were harmed , including their descendants . It 's a way of making them whole again . My experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 115,000 Japanese-Americans were incarcerated in camps here during World War II . These individuals had not committed any crimes and never had hearings . In the 1980 's , legislation was passed that provided each internee with an apology and compensation of about $20,000 . ESSENCE : Why is it that so many people , including AfricanAmericans , do n't support the notion of reparations for AfricanAmericans ? Some even scoff at it . Mary Frances Berry : In part , because the concept of reparations for African-Americans has had such a long and unsuccessful history . Since the nineteenth century , it 's been called for by people like Frederick Douglass . There was a whole movement for reparations after the Civil War , led by a Black woman named Callie House . She ended up in jail because the government argued that her idea was so ridiculous that she must have been engaged in some kind of fraud . In the 1960 's the idea came up again , but the societal and legal response was " This is ridiculous . It 's too costly . It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the idea had come up . I think the other reason that people express contempt is that over the last few years , whenever African-Americans make claims based on discrimination , we 're accused of emphasizing our victimhood . You get that accusation from Clarence Thomas-he 's not the only one , but he comes to mind-and from politicians on the Right and even some in the middle . S.M. : I remember the case , although it was based on treaties , of the Sioux Nation trying to recover losses when the Black Hills were taken from them . That took about 100 years to resolve . And with JapaneseAmericans , almost 50 years passed before the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of Civilians came forward with recommendations for redress . So it 's not unusual at the beginning of these movements for people to be hesitant , but often , as the issues become sharper and facts come out , there is a growing desire for reparations . ESSENCE : What facts would have to emerge to aid in the battle for Black reparations ? M.F.B. : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , has at some time thought this might be a good idea . Each time society seems to concede that an injustice has been perpetrated : After all , everyone agrees-I guess everyone-that slavery was unjust , and many people agree that Jim Crow was unjust and discrimination is unjust . And so then the notion is that it 's too costly . A White scholar named Boris Bittker figured out that the exploitation of labor without recompense justified reparations , but the cost was enormous . I do n't think more facts have to be toted up . It 's simply a matter of whether or not one is persuaded that awarding reparations is fruitful , and determining what would happen with the money : How much would you get and who would get it ? What would they do with it and what would it mean ? S.M. : I think it 's more of a public-education issue . I recall a debate within the Japanese-American community about which approach to take . Their organizations supported different approaches . Some favored class-action litigation , others wanted legislation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a commission to study the issue . It was through the pursuit of all three approaches that the American public and particularly institutions such as Congress were able to learn about and finally understand the seriousness of the government 's actions . With that , a movement developed , and a different political climate was created to receive the issue . Unless this kind of change occurs in the political landscape , it 's very hard to put forward a position for reparations that people can actually accept . M.F.B. : The absolute first step needs to be a public statement of the facts and the type of analysis Mr. Mark is talking about . The civil-rights organizations have on several occasions asked Congress to set up a commission to study the issue . Each time it was difficult even to get a committee hearing on this question . ESSENCE : Every two years since 1989 , Representative John Conyers D-MI has introduced a bill to study the proposals for African-American reparations , and it seems to go nowhere . M.F.B. : Right . Some people think , Oh well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass , so why bother ? Some people are embarrassed to suggest that reparations are needed ; they feel we should let bygones be bygones . Photograph // S.M. : That 's not an unusual attitude . That was the position the government tried to take in the case of Japanese-Americans : to ignore what had happened and not address the government 's role . In fact , it was government misconduct and the suppression and destruction of evidence that resulted in some of the decisions in the 1940 's . Those kinds of things need to be exposed . M.F.B. : We know that the government was directly responsible for the perpetuation of slavery , Jim Crow and discrimination . A commission would be able to make the link between the fact that African-Americans generally do n't have much capital to invest and the need for reparations . I just visited the Mississippi Delta , one of the poorest places in the country . It 's also a place where slavery thrived , and people descended from slaves never had any capital . A commission on reparations would solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be laid on the table , would be reason enough to argue for some kind of response or at least a public discussion about a response . ESSENCE : All over the world reparations are being made : Artwork and human remains are being returned to their rightful owners ; land rights and fishing treaties are being negotiated . Why is the idea of reparations gaining such global prominence ? M.F.B. : Because it 's a well-established concept now . Each example builds on the previous one , and more people are raising the issue and acting . So African-Americans may be the only ones not understanding that the timing may be right for this campaign . Perhaps we should be better informed about what everyone else is doing and understand that it 's not un-American to press claims . ESSENCE : Shortly after President Clinton apologized to victims of the Tuskegee syphilis study last spring , he agreed to consider apologizing for slavery . But he rejected the notion of reparations . M.F.B. : I 'm not surprised . Reparations are not a very easy thing to accept or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president , who has been very strong on issues concerning the rights of African-Americans , would reject it . Perhaps he considers support for affirmative action and other matters he has been involved in as substitutes , which is a position some proponents have taken in the past . ESSENCE : Would White people back reparations for African-Americans ? S.M. : I believe that if you asked many people , particularly White folks , they would honestly , genuinely feel that if they were in the shoes of AfricanAmericans , they would demand reparations . Our society needs to truly understand what harm was caused by the government , and particularly by institutions of slavery , before we can move on to what the remedies are . I think opponents of affirmative action are so successful at asserting there 's a color-blind society because they keep ignoring the fact that slavery and the racial discrimination following it still pervade society . There 's a belief that we 're all on a level playing field , that things have been corrected . See , affirmative action really deals with current or future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reparations for past conduct . Unless society deals with that , it 's very hard for some institutions to accept affirmative action as a policy that would help undercut racism or discrimination when the belief is that it no longer exists . M.F.B : Right . And not only do some people believe it no longer exists , but books and articles are also coming out now that deny it ever existed . Therefore , in some minds , there 's nothing to remedy . We need to find a way to close the books on the awful problem of race in this country . One way to do that is to have a public record and acknowledgment that yes , this happened ; yes , this continues ; and yes , the government is in or has been in complicity-and here 's what we 're going to do . And then let 's close the book and get on with it . It might stop the endless debates about what happened and be the first step in bringing about real racial healing and reconciliation in this society . <p>  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
