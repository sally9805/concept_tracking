When most people think of the flute , they think of a transverse , or horizontally held , instrument made of silver . The silver flute became the standard for professional players only at the turn of the century , however . Until that time , American and European flutes were made of various types of wood , as well as exotic materials such as ivory and crystal . During the mid to late 19th century , silver flutes began to be made in France , Germany and Great Britain , among other countries , and gained popularity for their brilliant tone and ease of manufacture . While wooden flutes never fell completely out of favor in Europe , by the 1920s most American musicians had relegated them to dusty attics and old barns . The folk music revival in the 1970s and 80s , in combination with a growing interest in playing baroque music on period instruments , helped rescue many of these flutes . It is now the instrument of choice for most American folk musicians and players of early chamber music . This has created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collectors . Over the years some of these wooden flutes found their way into the hands of Chris Abell , an instrument maker in Concord , Massachusetts . Through repairing them he came to know their strengths and weaknesses . He began to envision a concert-quality instrument that would combine the latest technical attributes of the modern silver flute with the rich , pungent tone of its predecessor . There are several reasons for the decline in use of the wooden flute by professional players , the first being that antique wooden flutes are often out of tune with themselves , or only play well in the second octave or in a limited number of key signatures . Most of these intonation problems are caused by the conical shape of the flute 's bore  --  the hole which runs lengthwise through the instrument and is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom . Great demands were made upon players of conical flutes , who had to apply different breath pressures to individual notes in order to stay in tune . Many of these acoustical imperfections and difficulties in fingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the 1840s and 50s , invented the modern key system for the more easily manufactured cylindrical bore flute . Determined to revive the professional viability of this wooden instrument , Abell has taken up where Boehm left off . Carrying the wood tradition a step further , he has updated Boehm 's instrument by using the most current scale , thus meeting the demands of the professional marketplace . Abell 's fascination with instrument making began at the age of 22 , when he bought his first flute , a silver student model . Before playing it he spent an hour or so just looking at it in its case . " I 'd never taken shop . I had no concept of what the manufacturing process is all about , " says Abell . But he was fascinated by the complexity of the keywork . Ten years later , after having become an accomplished player of traditional Irish music , he assisted an amateur instrument maker in the building of flutes out of nickel silver and brass . While he undertook this project simply out of curiosity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fall of 1982 Abell brought one of these flutes to Boston , a mecca for flute makers . Three of the most distinguished flute companies in the world are located in the area  --  Haynes Flute &; Piccolo Company , Powell Verne Q. Flutes and Brannen Brothers Flutemakers  --  as well as several important makers of other instruments . Abell carried the flute from one company to another , hoping to be taken on . When he approached Brannen Brothers in Woburn , Massachusetts , a world-class manufacturer of fine gold and silver instruments , much to Abell 's delight , Bickford Brannen , the president , offered him a job . " I thought about it for three minutes , " Abell says . After apprenticing with Brannen Brothers for three years , he left the company in 1985 to set up shop in Concord , Massachusetts , with the sole purpose of conceptualizing and designing a contemporary version of the wooden flute . At Brannen Brothers Abell had been working just with metal , but " I wanted the challenge of metal and wood together . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to wood . ( Originally Abell Woodwinds , his shop , since 1989 , has been called the Abell Flute Co . ) To prepare for the flute project he chose to experiment with a relatively simple , centuries-old wind instrument , the pennywhistle , also known as the " tin " whistle , from its traditional material . An end-blown instrument , it is used for the playing of dance music throughout Ireland , Scotland and Brittany . Abell took an existing pennywhistle as a model . He copied its length , the space between the tone holes , the sizes of the holes themselves . As he expresses it , his design was born out of frustration with the existing instrument . Unlike traditional pennywhistles , his would be easily tunable . To achieve this Abell kept the head joint separate from the body so that it could be tonally adjusted , as on a recorder . He chose African blackwood for its stability and its traditional look . Abell soon found himself filling custom orders : " I had n't planned on making hundreds of whistles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He discovered that the mental and technical processes of designing one instrument were far different from manufacturing dozens . " You can get by for ten people , but if a hundred want them , you need the ability to repeat consistently . " The sleek beauty and warm tone of this wood-and-silver whistle gave traditional players something new and special . Violin players can buy an instrument for $200 or $15,000 ( or more ) . Flute players have a similar spectrum from which to choose . But whistle players , be they amateur or professional , had nothing but the old one-piece metal whistle , dents and all . Unlike the six-or seven-dollar metal whistles , Abell 's whistles sell for two hundred dollars , sometimes more , depending on the options . The whistle proved to be an ideal testing ground for the flute project , since most of the steps involved in making a whistle mirror those of making a flute . Abell 's whistles consist of a plastic plug for he mouthpiece , sections of silver tubing where the head joint meets the body , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood ) . The manufacturing of the whistles and the flutes requires a great deal of machinery and specialized jigs , fixtures and hand tools . Because both instruments are cut from an unusually dense material , Abell uses a metalworking lathe to turn the block of wood into a cylinder . A gun drill cuts the lengthwise hole through the wood tube to form the whistle or flute 's bore , and a mandrel assures that the inside of the wooden tube is parallel with the outside . The silver joint bands are glued onto the wood tube with a pressing machine . This process preferably takes place the same day that the wood cylinder is completed , because wood tends to expand or contract with the passage of time . To assure that the instruments are in tune and that the keywork mechanisms operate properly , Abell works to tolerances within one thousandth of an inch , a precision he also requires from his silver stock manufacturers . Out of necessity he has made many of his own tools , including tone-hole cutters and templates , among others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in the instrument itself , " he says . Over the years Abell has continued to work with Brannen Brothers on a contract basis . Between Brannen flute orders and whistle orders he is constantly pressed for time . Thus four years went by before he began his long-awaited flute project . When Abell speaks of the flute-making process , he often uses the word " mystery . " Although many of the steps required to make a whistle are identical to those in flute making , there are subtle and labor-intensive differences . Abell spends most of his time on the flute 's head joint , which determines the tonal quality of the entire instrument . " There is as much intuition in making the head joint as measurable handwork . " While the main body of the instrument is cylindrical on the inside and the outside , the interior of the head joint is conical , an inside cut which , through the use of mirrors and grinding tools , requires a great deal of care . The head joint alone makes the difference between a good instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth has to be cut at just the right place and at just the desired angle to produce the rich one Abell is looking for . It takes him a full week just to fit the keywork onto the flute body . Placing pads on the keys of the instrument and shimming the pads to the correct density are among the most time-consuming of his tasks . Since 1991 Abell has custom-made nine wood-and-silver flutes and sold eight of them . They range in price from $6,100 to $8,000 . These instruments have found homes in Canada , France and Scotland , as well as in the United States . Two of his flutes have been sold to an instrument dealer in Vancouver , British Columbia , while the remaining sales are equally divided between professional players , such as Patrick Gallois of France , and serious amateurs . Chris Abell likes to think that certain parts of the manufacturing process will be a total mystery to those who are uninitiated in this craft . For example , he would like people to look at the almost seamless connections between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do this ! How was it accomplished ?
