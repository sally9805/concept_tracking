Even from a distance , the grayish two-story home with panoramic windows and pointed chimney casts a distinctive profile against the suburban sky . But only a closer inspection reveals what is truly unique about this house . Instead of sporting bricks or aluminum siding , the dwelling is covered with superstrong , superdurable plastic panels . The shingles on its vaulted roof are made not of wood but of another tough plastic ; so too , in fact , are the floors , doorframes , light fixtures , plumbing pipes and even the windows . <P> This experimental " plastic " house , built by General Electric in Pittsfield , Mass. , is perhaps the most striking use so far of a new class of souped-up substances called advanced materials . These novel building blocks are basically futuristic versions of present-day metals , glasses , plastics and ceramics . But unlike conventional counterparts , the materials are made with extra ingredients that greatly enhance their performance or give them new features . By blending in stiff carbon fibers , for example , modern-day alchemists have developed plastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastics . And by mixing copper with zinc and aluminum , scientists have produced a metal with a " memory " : the stuff returns to its original shape after being bent or twisted . <P> The new materials are usually designed on computers , which can analyze exactly how the molecules of different substances will fit together . As a result , complex compounds can be made to order for specific tasks . They can be engineered to be as solid as cement yet as light as foam cushion , or sturdy like steel but pliable like rubber . Because of their superior properties , advanced materials are rapidly replacing ordinary steel , aluminum and plastics in everything from cutlery to cars . Scientists have high hopes of conserving natural commodities such as iron , wood and rubber . Says Robert Newnham , a professor of solid-state science at Pennsylvania State : " At one time , we had to settle for whatever Mother Nature gave us . Now if we 're not satisfied we can go out and create our own materials . " <P> Advanced materials are just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ceramic scissors that never rust or get dull , plastic lumber that is water-resistant and does not swell or warp like wood , and " metal " windows that keep excessive light and heat out of a house in summer and trap them inside during winter . In the U.S. the aerospace industry , including the military , is the biggest consumer of engineered materials , accounting for more than two-thirds of all use . The substances , used in door panels and floors , account for about 14% of a typical airplane 's weight , in contrast to 2% ten years ago . Stealth bombers and fighter jets are wrapped in skins of composite nonmetallic materials that help make the planes more difficult to detect with radar .
