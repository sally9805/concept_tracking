<p> When I was young , I would go to sleep nights dreaming of big fish and the one I would have " mounted " if I ever caught one that measured up to the trophy standards of a 12-year old . A big fish , any big fish , would be displayed in a place of honor on my bedroom wall . As I reminisce , I am not quite sure what would have constituted a real trophy . When I grew up we never measured fish by weight , only by inches . A 20-inch brown or rainbow trout would probably have qualified for the wall . <p> Today there are rivers only a few hours drive from my home where I can fish for trout in the 16-to 18-pound range . As people grow older , their interests change . Mine were no exception . I have grown to be an enthusiastic bow-hunter for turkey and as such , I devote all of my time in the fall to these pursuits . Because of my hunting interests , my fishing is now limited to bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although I have the interest , I do n't have the time to chase these large fish when the fall run begins . <p> Just before Christmas , I received a call from Tim Bamberg who runs the Reel Thrill Charter out of the Wilson Marina near Buffalo . I met Tim last summer when I went salmon fishing with him on Lake Ontario . Tim inquired if I was interested in a float fishing trip down the lower Niagara River for lake trout and steelhead . It 's not often one gets an opportunity to fish for eight- to 10-pound trout with a fellow who knows fishing inside and out . I could n't say yes fast enough . <p> Accompanying me on this outing was my colleague , Harvie Loomis , an art teacher from Newark Valley , New York . Neither he nor I had ever done any float fishing . I had a feeling that for two rookies like us , this would be a trip we would never forget . <p> We arrived in Lewiston two days after Christmas and I could see it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen as well . Bank fishing access on the lower Niagara River is available at Artpark in Lewiston and at the Lewiston Sand Dock at the foot of Center Street . Also located here is a first class boat launch which is only a short boat ride from the well known fishing area , Devil 's Hole . <p> The sheer cliffs of the Niagara escarpment make the lower Niagara a safe haven for boaters . The high cliffs above the river form a natural shelter and refuge from the crashing waves and wind of Lake Ontario . Excellent trout fishing is available in the river even when the lake becomes too restless to fish . Drifting , trolling , still fishing and casting are all methods used by area fishermen . We found the waters near the boat launch site to be swift and calm . However , the currents near the hydroelectric plants just south of Artpark were fast and tricky . This is no area for a small boat with an inexperienced operator . The Devil 's Hole is located just south of the hydro plant and fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the river , I was glad Tim was a qualified guide with the proper fishing machine . <p> When it came to this type of fishing , Harvie and I were raw amateurs . Neither of us had fished like this before but Tim assured us we would n't have any problems . Drift fishing proved to be easy and fun . Tim explained the main run of steelhead had not yet begun , but there would be a good number of lake trout in the river . Lakers run up rivers in the fall and tend to concentrate in large pools such as the Devil 's Hole . The steelhead spawn in the spring , but they begin entering the spawning streams as early as the preceding September . For this reason Tim felt we would catch a mixed bag of lakers and steelhead . <p> Harvie and I met Tim at the boat launch on Thursday morning and headed upriver for the swirling eddies of the Devil 's Hole . Tim explained that we would be using Quick Fish lures which are similar to the famous Flatfish lures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reduce the number of snags and to make unhooking fish easier . <p> The basic idea of driftfishing is to allow the lure to trail behind the boat while bouncing a pencil lead of the bottom . The rig is made up of a three way swivel , the lead , and the lure . The rod end of the line is tied to one end of the swivel while the lure with about six feet of leader is tied to the other . The one ounce pencil lead is tied with about three inches of light line which allows the lure to be worked free in case the lead hits a snag . This arrangement seemed to be the most popular and economical way to fish . We were fishing in 10 to 15 feet of fast moving water and the heavy weight was necessary to keep the lure working near bottom . <p> Tim instructed us to drop our lures straight down and to keep the line as vertical as possible . " A longer line invites snags " , Tim told us . By keeping the lure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely not to lose any lures . I was fishing with a Diawa baitcasting outfit with eight-pound Dupont Magnathin line and a five and a half foot Samuari baitcasting rod . I choose this combination because the Diawa reel has an exceptionally smooth drag . Because we were using relatively light line , we needed all the advantages we could get . Tim and Harvie opted for their spinning tackle and both combinations proved effective over the course of the afternoon . <p> Tim explained that one of the secrets of drift fishing was to select the correct amount of lead for the type of water we were fishing . Not enough lead would not allow the lures to work near the bottom where the fish were . Too much lead and the lures would hang up and be lost . Tim advised us to anticipate a tap-tap-tap on the rod which would tell us the lead and the lures were skipping along the rock strewn bottom at the proper depth . <p> As we started the first drift , our lures had hardly hit bottom when Tim said he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift water , Tim lost him . It did n't matter . The boat drifted only a few more yards when Harvie 's rod bent under the weight of a good fish . The fish took off up river against the pull of the drag . " Keep the rod low , " Tim instructed . Harvie worked the fish back to the boat and after 10 minutes of fighting to rod and swift current , and eight pound steelhead was safely in the boat . <p> The next several drifts proved unsuccessful . On the fourth drift , the action picked up again . I felt the tap-tap of my lead weight change to a slight tug on the line . I raised the rod tip and nearly had it ripped from my grasp . I let the fish work upstream against the drag until I was able to turn it in our direction . The fish made several more runs and Tim advised me to work him toward the back of the boat where he could net him . This was easier said than done . Anyone who says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , shallow water on light tackle . Eventually , I was able to work the reluctant laker near Tim so that he could slip him into the net . I breathed a sigh of relief when I saw the nine-pond laker in the boat . <p> I was experimenting with silver and blue and silver and black Wally Diver lures . I was interested in seeing if the popular walleye lure would work on Niagara River trout . The lure had a nice side-to-side wobble that seemed attractive to the lake trout . Harvie and Tim were catching steelhead on their Quick Fish lures . It seemed there was a color and lure preference for each species of fish . <p> We fished for another hour hooking and losing several nice fish . The action eventually slowed down and Tim elected to head down river to fish what is known locally as the Kingston Long Drift and the Stella Niagara Drifts . The water was much calmer in these areas , but we were unable to hook any other fish on either of the drifts . Tim decided we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , we navigated the swirling eddies and fast rapids just north of the hole . Tim barely had the boat in position when I hooked a good trout . it was another laker that scooped up a silver and blue Wally Diver . Tim had no sooner netted my fish when Harvie hooked and landed a six-pound steelhead . <p> I commented to Tim that I had expected savage strikes from fish this big . Tim informed me the contrary was true . The fish barely hit the lure and the fisherman must be alert for a change in the vibration and feel of the lure as it skips over the bottom . <p> I asked Tim if lures were the only things he uses when drifting the river , and he informed me that sometimes he prefers to use egg sacks and yarn flies . Tying a piece of brightly colored yarn ahead of an egg sack , gives him an edge in hooking light biters . The yarn adds color contrast to the bait and makes it difficult for the toothy trout to spit out the hook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth and the movement of the fish 's head in an attempt to get rid of the yarn , alerts the fisherman . Fishing egg sacks and yarn is a little different than fishing lures . Any slowing or stopping of the egg sack should be assumed to be a trout picking up the bait . When fishing egg sucks in this manner , it is wise to set the hook hard . <p> If there was one thing I learned about drift fishing for large trout , it was that drift fishing was an easy and thoroughly enjoyable way to fish . The fish proved there was no one special lure that was better than another . In fact , it was fun to experiment with various lures in my tackle box . Fishing tackle could be anything the angler wished to use . Access to the river was easy , and the fish were there in numbers . <p> There was no roughing it on this trip .
