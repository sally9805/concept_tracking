<p> This week , Robert Redford takes a big step on a long journey born of heartbreak . <p> In 1969 , the first film he produced , Downhill Racer , was dumped by Paramount after a few weeks because the studio did n't know how to sell it . <p> Since then Redford has had great success within the studio system , but he also has championed small , sometimes unconventional films made outside the studios . <p> In 1980 , Redford formed the Sundance Institute ( named after the outlaw he played in Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid ) to support young filmmakers , and out of that came the Sundance Film Festival in Park City , Utah , where new filmmakers and actors are discovered every January . Some of the films that opened at Sundance : Four Weddings and a Funeral ; sex , lies , and videotape ; and Hoop Dreams . <p> Today , his Sundance Film Channel is introduced at the National Cable Show in Dallas , where cable operators can sign up for it . <p> Think of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering an everyday mix of independent films , documentaries , short subjects , foreign films and animation - with no worries about whether a film is deemed commercial . <p> The pay service premieres in October . <p> " I love diversity , " Redford , 58 , says at his Wildwood production company office . " It 's vital to the success of any culture . Cities are starting to look the same . Films are starting to look the same , and I want to keep diversity alive . Independent film gives you stories , subjects and talent you do n't normally see . <p> " Hollywood is a formula industry . It 's all about business and profit , and that 's why they 're always looking at a formula for guaranteed success . You ca n't make $ 100 million on a small black-and-white love story or anything that tells about our lives and the diversity out there . " <p> Sundance Film Channel is n't cable 's only home for alternative cinema . Redford initially approached Rainbow Programming Services ( Bravo and American Movie Classics ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then cut a deal with Showtime Networks ( Showtime and The Movie Channel ) to serve as his partner handling the day-to-day operations and marketing , while Redford and his staff contribute to the network 's overall vision . <p> Rainbow created its own service , the Independent Film Channel , which launched in September . It 's available to 1.5 million viewers in New York , Boston and Los Angeles . <p> Like Sundance , IFC offers films , documentaries , animation and shorts , but older films - such as Black Orpheus and The 400 Blows - are also part of the mix . <p> " The cable industry tends to be skeptical of new channels before they 're launched , " says IFC general manager Kathleen Dore . " That 's why we tried to get on the air so quickly , to have something concrete the industry could see . " <p> To entice subscribers to order in the fall , Sundance is in previews on Showtime and The Movie Channel . <p> Lined up to appear on Sundance in the fall : Claire of the Moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adventures of Priscilla , Queen of the Desert ; Barcelona ; and the documentary My Life Is in Turnaround . <p> Additionally , shorts by Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin and animation from the National Film Board of Canada and Expanded Entertainment are on tap . <p> Tom Adams , the president of Adams Media Research , does n't see a huge market for the independent film channels , " but the beauty of cable is that you do n't need a big audience to survive and prosper . The great hope is that by making these films more easily available , more people will get to see them . " <p> Many new channels have had a hard time getting cable operators to add them , but most systems are upgrading and Adams sees channel capacity " dramatically opening up " over the next five years . <p> Which will make it , IFC or Sundance ? " It 's a tough call , " he says . " Rainbow is very well connected ( it 's owned by NBC , TCI and Cablevision ) , but Sundance has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Although Redford will continue his movie career - currently he 's filming Up Close and Personal , in which he plays a TV news director who falls in love with reporter Michelle Pfeiffer - he says he will be very involved with the Sundance channel , overseeing the programming , marketing and on-air look . <p> What he wo n't be , he says , is the channel 's Bob Dorian . Do n't look for him to introduce the films ( as Dorian does on AMC ) ; his presence will be limited to an occasional interview or perhaps a seminar with filmmakers . ( He is part of an on-air video introduction to Sundance that 's now airing on Showtime and TMC . ) <p> The walls of Redford 's Wildwood office are lined with photos of Redford and his three children at Sundance and in New Mexico , where he filmed The Milagro Beanfield War . In the hallways is a collection of movie posters from a varied career , from Barefoot in the Park ( 1967 ) and The Great Gatsby to The Sting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directorial efforts , such as Ordinary People , Milagro , A River Runs Through It and last year 's Quiz Show . <p> He considers many of the films he has headed up to be independent , in that they were smaller , lower-budget movies financed outside the studio system . His formula : Work on one commercial film ( such as an Indecent Proposal ) and bank on that success to make the small films . <p> " I 've always been a maverick , " says Redford , pointing to films he produced such as Jeremiah Johnson and The Candidate . " I believe there 's a huge , underserved market out there for these type of films . Film is so broad , but the industry keeps narrowing it down . " <p> Redford 's Sundance Institute - including the Utah ski resort , restaurant , lodge and mail-order catalog ( the biggest moneymaker of the bunch ) - generates cash for student film and theater programs . The cable channel is a for-profit venture , but he says future profits will continue funding arts programs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York and Utah , but " works " in Los Angeles , first came across Utah in 1961 , while driving back and forth between his home in Los Angeles and the University of Colorado , where he was a student . He discovered the majesty of the 12,000-foot , snow-capped Mount Timpanogos . " It was one of the greatest views I had ever seen , " he recalls . <p> Redford convinced a local farmer to sell him two acres for $ 500 , and he went back to L.A. to begin his acting career . Thirty-four years later , Redford now owns 6,000 acres . <p> Besides developing the Sundance channel , Redford has spent the past year negotiating several film projects . He was set to co-star with Jodie Foster in Crisis in the Hot Zone , about a viral outbreak , but both he and Foster dropped out at the last minute , saying the story needed a lot of work . Then he was going to star for director Rob Reiner in The American President , a film about a commander-in-chief who has an affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last minute , saying his vision was different from Reiner 's . Michael Douglas took over the role . <p> Now he 's doing Up Close for director Jon Avnet , calling it a " good love story " that happens to be set in the TV news business . He has several projects in development at his production company , and he says he 'll act in rather than direct his next film , because it 's not as consuming . <p> After all , he has a channel to launch .
