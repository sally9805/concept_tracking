<p> Not since the tall ships has there been national esprit as great as that inspired by the budget negotiations . In bank lines , drugstores , supermarkets and parking lots Americans have gathered in a spirit of grand unanimity to discuss the possibility that the people who run the Government are completely out to lunch . <p> Some of this public sentiment is due to the technological advances afforded by cable television , which enable us to watch actual deliberations on the House and Senate floor and to see that the average debate in Congress bears a remarkable resemblance to a kindergarten classroom when the teacher has been called away . <p> The people have realized the dirty little secret of those of us in journalism : that by distilling public officials to one sound bite , one quote , we made them look like ringmasters when so many of them were actually clowns . <p> Some have found this entire spectacle entertaining , and some have found it disgusting , and some have found it entertaining and disgusting at the same time , not unlike watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lines between children 's television and the Federal Government are blurred . Are John Sununu , Newt Gingrich and Marlin Fitzwater real people , or are they cartoon characters ? If they are real , why do they have those names ? And if people get the government they deserve , are we all Mickey Mouse ? <p> Many of us might never have noticed the budget negotiations until we picked up our paychecks , looked at the revised amount , and said , " Well , there go the car payments . " But closing the Statue of Liberty , the Washington Monument and the Grand Canyon sent a signal that we had better listen up . And when we did we realized it was the end of an era . For 10 years we have been living with the big lie , the lie that we know so well because we have told it ourselves . The check is in the mail . Finally the bill has come due . " You can fool all the people all the time if the advertising is right and the budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levine once said . There is no evidence that he was speaking of Ronald Reagan , but if the quote fits , share it . <p> The people have had their own convictions about all of this , which is more than you can say for Congress . The people like the idea of taxing those with more money at a higher rate . ( The President went for the idea for about a half-hour the other day , but then Republicans came to call and he backed off . There are more waffles in Washington this week than there are at the House of Pancakes . ) The New York Times took a poll , and a whopping 87 percent of those surveyed said that people making over $100,000 should pay more in taxes . Shall we all guess how much money those respondents make ? The defense budget also seems vulnerable . It has heretofore stood for our belief in ourselves as a macho , hairy-chested kind of country . But since we discovered that the Soviet Union is a third-world nation that can not even manage to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Defense Department has been known to spend $27.50 on such items as paper clips , hairy-chestedness has ebbed somewhat as a national priority . <p> These two things wo n't be enough to put a dent in the deficit , and we 've always known it . Some of us will grouse about entitlement programs , until we realize that entitlements include things we like , like Social Security . Some of us will grouse about welfare ; like a company mounting a recall , the Government of the 1980 's spent a lot of time teaching us to trash its wares . All decade long , there was a free-association test . Welfare . . . cheat . Trickle . . . down . Free . . . market . Tax . . . cuts . <p> Everybody flunked . We just did n't know it until now , when we are no longer under the voodoo-economics spell of an avuncular , folksy , not terribly bright guy who only said the nation 's finances were in a helluva mess when he thought the microphone was turned off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due at the worst possible time : when our homes are devalued , when filling our gas tanks and grabbing a burger is an either/or proposition , when beef is a luxury item . Deep in our hearts we knew that the cuts would someday be deep and the cost high . But we figured the guys in Washington had a plan . Until we saw them on television and could n't tell them from Yogi Bear and Boo Boo . Until we tried to take our kids to the Smithsonian one Saturday and discovered that the only dinosaurs you could see in town were the ones at the Capitol . <p> At least it 's brought us together .
