It 's time to get serious about fat . Cut it . Skim it . Trim it . Get rid of it . Excess fat has no place on our hips or in our healthy lifestyles  --  especially when diets high in fat have been linked to obesity , hypertension , stroke , cancer , diabetes and heart disease . Our solution : Cut the fat down to 25 percent or less a day and fill up on whole grains , beans , pasta , vegetables and fruits , and add a side order of aerobic exercise  --  at least 30 minutes three times a week . For more ideas , turn the page . Whereas a typical American diet derives about 37 percent of its daily calories from fat , health experts at the American Heart Association , the National Cancer Institute and the United States Department of Agriculture agree that to achieve well-being , we need to keep the fat we eat down to 30 percent or less of calories a day . For a healthy adult woman , a well-balanced daily diet consists of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pasta , peas and beans ; five to six servings of fruits and vegetables ; and one to two servings of low-fat dairy products and of lean meat , fish or poultry . On average , we need between 1,200 and 1,600 calories a day ( with no more than 33 to 45 grams  --  about two tablespoons  --  of fat ) to maintain our weight ( more calories are a reward for an active lifestyle ; less-active women should use the smaller number ) . We wo n't need to count calories , however , if we learn to limit our intake of fats . The worst culprits include butter , cheese , cream , fatback , lard , margarine , shortening , coconut and palm oils , egg yolks , organ meats and breaded and fried foods that are high in saturated fats and cholesterol . But watch out  --  there are still ways we can get tripped up : The way foods are labeled is n't always accurate . Packaged foods , such as potato chips , peanut butter and processed lunch meats , that proclaim " light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat-free " may actually contain high levels of fat . So it 's best to read the fine print on ingredients and note the nutritional analyses . Here are 15 ways we can cut back on the fat and enhance the flavor in the foods we love most : * Experiment with low-fat cooking methods , such as baking , broiling , grilling , microwaving , steaming , stir-frying and stewing. * Grease pans with cooking spray or low-fat canola oil . * Try plain low-fat yogurt with seasonings instead of mayonnaise in sandwiches and salad dressings or sour cream on baked potatoes . * Season steamed vegetables with lemon juice and herbs . * Add carrots , celery , garlic , mushrooms , onions , peppers and tomatoes to pasta and rice dishes , soups and stews. * Cook greens or rice in a meat broth from which all fat has been skimmed . * Eat more fish and poultry . * Remove the skin from poultry after broiling or grilling. * Braise or stew lean meats in broth with herbs and vegetables . * Limit eggs , red meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice cream to once or twice a week . * Avoid sauces or casseroles with butter , cream or cheese . * Choose skim milk ( less than 1 percent fat ) or 1-percent milk ( about 23 percent fat ) over whole milk . * Snack on fresh or dried fruits rather than donuts , cookies or candy bars . * Use two egg whites instead of one whole egg in cakes , cookies and quick-break recipes . * Replace oil with apple juice or applesauce to give baked desserts a moist texture .
