ContentsPedro Martir Juana la Enamorada Juana la Dislocada , 1503 Philip Juana la Despojada Dos Cuervos Juana la Muerta # AS A CHILD , I HAD A SMALL GUITAR in a red satin case trimmed with pearls . I played the clavichord . I loved music , and Latin . They were my company . I spoke little . I suspect that I feared my tongue as others did ; it was sharp and slit swiftly . I required few words ; my tongue cut quick work . I kept to myself . I was a dark slip of a girl , proud like my mother Isabella . But I preferred my father . I had little patience with girls . <p> Me toca la luna . The moon touches me . The idiom means that I am a woman or that I am mad , or that they are the same condition . Blood and lunacy . Once the moon touched me beneath my skirts , my parents turned their attention to my betrothal . I had no particular desire to marry , but my parents hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Habsburg : Felipe el Guapo . He was reputed to be handsome , at eighteen only two years older than I. He wrote me a letter that I read and reread , trying to imagine being wife to this page of words . Only later would I learn from Felipe that his secretary midwived , composed the letter for him . <p> At night , far from music , my dreams grew inky . In one , an unseen hand immures me . Brick by brick the curved wall rises . I shout , and my voice returns to me like a drop of rain striking well water . At the edges of my dream I hear murmurs , whispers . Susurrating . Who are they ? Why do they do this ? The wall grows higher . The bricks spiral . The wall encloses me . My palms press against it . The darkness thuds into place . This is my castled night-Juana de Castile . At the edge of the dream , I hear the voices , a community of whispers , rumors . My heart shudders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It flaps through black chambers like a bat . But it does not come back . It flies from me . Juana . <p> I am not crazy yet . <p> Or this dream : I am pitching on my bed . Then the bed becomes the ocean , and I am afraid . There is only water . I am slipping from myself into the water . I am sinking . The water parts and closes over me . The darkness is complete and cold . My toes wriggle , but there is nowhere a bottom , just the endless dropping down . My mind spins and my stomach cramps , and then I think no more , but give myself up to the darkness . <p> Nightmare is my gift of prophecy . These are the same dream , just built of different substance . <p> When my parents informed me that I was to cross the Bay of Biscay , I trembled . I did not want to fall into the ocean of my dream , but I thought of Cristobal Colon , the courage by which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , had been disappointed . My mother rarely granted him audience . He had found his new worlds ; now I was to find my own . The new worlds of my heart , of Lierre , of El Guapo . My foreign continents . <p> I and my retinue embarked in the middle of the Temporales . The water surged and troughed , straight-walled drops to the spumy , roiling foam . The waves gnashed , and I clung to what I could . I watched my trousseau rocked and knocked until the chest loosed its ropes and tumbled off the port side . The waters parted and closed . My coffined trousseau slid into the depthless deep of the sea , a darkness complete and cold . My inky dream again unfurled , its squid eye fixing me . I would arrive empty-handed , then , to meet my intended , no finery to adorn me . How could I have known how little I 'd be wanting clothes ? I was a virgin . I did n't know passion 's habits . I was soon to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Temporales of my heart , of my desire . <p> So we arrived . El Guapo was as handsome as his name . Yellow hair , I had never seen hair so yellow  --  like pollen . I was a bee for his yellow dust . He was as compact , as solid , as I was slight . We were of opposite elements , he fair and hard-formed , fed on goose and cabbage ; I dark and frail , a confit of olives , almonds , and figs . Like my trousseau , I sank with only a splash and not a ripple . I was his , and I would have him . I commanded Diego Villaescusa to marry us en seguida . <p> In a ground-floor room overlooking the river Nethe , we ripped off our clothes and fell on each other . As Felipe panted above me , on me , into me , I parted like water , let the hard part of myself go . As my blood broke , I watched the gilt Christ crucify himself on the ceiling . Dios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who would have thought I had such love in me ? I threw my arms wide . <p> The townspeople celebrated our union , drinking in the streets . Tables swayed beneath their heaped bounty of bread , fruit , roasts , and sweets . The burghers romped and jigged . Beneath their enthusiastic feet , a bridge collapsed into the Nethe . The air rained heavy with flowers . Blossoms sprigged our bower . Boughs and chains and laurels wreathed the streets . I was heady with the sweetness everywhere , so much so that I did not notice the dampness , the misty marshes lying low , the cramping masses , teeming alleys , and my missing Castilian sun . I had plunged in . I was drowning in love . My bridge broke beneath me . <p> Pedro Martir Ignore my name . It lacks meaning and irony both . I am no martyr . I did nothing to help la princesa , but I watched her lose all regard , watched her lose herself to love . Juana la perdida . For her I imagine love was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He bordered on stocky , lank hair , bad teeth and bad knee . But then I doubt he had much use for his knees except to push his advantage between plump thighs . He did not strike me as one to pray . His world was one of indulgences , fatty roasts and hearty wines , a thick-carpeted world , plush , lit with the gemstone iridescence of Venice , cluttered with the oddments and amusements of his Brussels . He was a total foreigner to her austerity . His passions were passing . He liked her well enough , mind you : her dark litheness , her virginal trust . El Guapo liked virgins . Very much . He specialized in them . <p> He was a silly man , schooled in diversions , catechized in pleasures . Silly , perhaps even stupid , and spoiled . He was despreocupado , expertly careless . As Tomas de Matienzo reported to Isabella , he was a man " que tenla un corazon duro y crudo sin ninguna piedad . " Hard and crude . But Juanita cupped all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that verged on the divine . All the stored-up loneliness of her sixteen years , all her aloofness , reversed . She attached herself to him with the zeal of an eel , with a squid 's tentacled embrace . And he rewarded her with almost immediate betrayal . He placed Flemish spies among her maids of honor , overlooked Martin de Moxica 's liberties with her income , and he strayed like a stream , dipping in and out of the virgins who pebbled his path . <p> In her accouchement with Elinor , her firstborn , Juana confided to her confessor that Philip 's indiscretions caused her great " turbacion . " But Philip had his habits ; he would what he would . He had his predilection for virgins , and she , of course , was one no longer . <p> On the eve of St. Mathias , February 24 , Juana gave birth to their son , Charles V. Philip gave her a gift for her labors , a large , lustrous pearl shaped like a teardrop . Thinking of her pearl-trimmed guitar case at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Spain . She was , unlike her husband , preocupada . She feared spies everywhere . She was not , as he mischaracterized her , suspicious ; she was merely sensible . With Juan and Isabella dead , his eyes were on the throne . She began having bouts of fainting . It was her way of following her trousseau , slipping into the bottomlessness , if only for a moment  --  a way to escape the knowledge that her husband was a callow , callous cad . <p> Philip steered her home by way of Anne of Brittany 's . Juana would not recognize her until Anne tripped her and thereby tricked her into paying homage to Ferdinand 's hated French . But Juana la Orgullosa recovered . Orgullo , Castilian pride , is stronger than the reddest wine . Spine like a sword blade , she straightened herself . She refused alms in Queen Anne 's name , refused to follow her train in court . While Philip played at the tournaments , hunted stag , and falconed with Louis , Juana stepped imperiously through the courts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the love of her father , for the love of the father who , too , would betray her , she refused to bow . When Philip first deserted her , Juana was pregnant with her third child . Leaving on what would be his year-long return trip to Brussels , he was immune to her tears and entreaties , as " hard as the diamond . " What then was her father ? What stone , what gem , strikes harder than diamante ? In its facet , you cut the woman whose life might have been other . Juana la Brillante . <p> She was a splendid woman , strong , keenly intelligenced , sardonic , passionate . Little surprise that it took so many men so long to bring her down . <p> Juana la Enamorada I had a brooch once , worked into a naked man . I gave it away . I do not know to whom . Felipe was the only naked man I wanted . I had seen others , the flagellants on Seriedad , beating themselves through the predawn darkness , beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know such love . Gotas son gotas . Drops are drops . Blood and tears , both are salty . Perlas y lagrimas . My husband taught me how to cry tears of blood . <p> He wore a violent violet when he appeared before my parents , violet velvet , gold , and satin brocade . How he shimmered against their somber wools . He was gorgeous . But a gloom settled on him . Our observances made him restless . He rattled the bones of our reliquaries , sneered at our solemnities . He needed gaiety , and I tried to amuse him with my small guitar , with my clavichord . But he was listless . He had problems in Brussels , he said . He must go . <p> My mother was firm . I could not go until parturition . I pled with him to wait . My stomach heavy , I straddled him , kissing until his lips were red as poppies . On my knees , I bandaged my pleading hands in the hem of his shirt . But he would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " Take me with you , " I yelled at his retreating entourage . Not even a horsetail twitch by way of answer . I wailed after him until there was nothing left of me to wail . <p> Juana la Dislocada , 1503 Where he is I locate myself . Invierno . My stomach swells huge like a melon , but I am barren in a desert of whispers . <p> See how she twists her hair around her finger . Pobrecita . Senseless gestures . She is trasportada . She is not here . She talks to herself . First Felipe , then Felipe , and again Felipe . No , she talks to him , but he is not here . He can not answer . She talks to him in her head . She sighs . She ignores her plate and bed . She paces through her lunes . She has developed the habit of staring through windows . She sees birds that are not there , hears raps that do not sound . <p> A scene : " I birthed him . I birthed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband . I must go to him . You do not know him . They are not like us . They will take anyone into their beds . It is their custom , and they think it is their right . And Madre mio , I can not bear it . I will kill them all , the little putas , the slutty pups . You must let me go to Felipe . " <p> " Daughter , you need to learn patience . Bide a while . You are too hot . You must learn the dignity of your stature . Royalty , Juana , Juanita , demands sacrifice . This is your duty to your lineage . " <p> " Lineage , Madre ? And Reina Isabella , tell me what is my duty to my husband , to me , to love ? You do not know how the women nose and nip at him . I love him . I must go to him . I have not known my husband for months , Mama . I want him again between my thighs . That is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not yourself . " <p> " I am myself . Juana . You are determined to make me not myself , determined to make me mad . " <p> " Do not raise your voice to me . You need rest . " <p> Rest , I found rest , dispatched by my mother to Segovia , to La Mota , my hilltop jail , a tryst with my husband dependent on a truce with France . Why am I incarcerated here ? To keep my husband from inheriting Spain ? I can not know . I cry my purled tears of pearl . I hum my songs . I pray in my chapel of whispers . Felipe . Felipe . Mea culpa . Mea culpa . <p> She is disconsolate . She broods . See how she stares at what is not there . <p> In November , Fonseca drops a letter on my table . I know the seal . Felipe is home . " Why do you not come home ? " he writes . " Why do you not join me ? " <p> Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sand . Whispers . A few saltating grains . Why do I not come ? Husband , I do come . I am leaving . Now . I descend from my turreted chamber and run across the patio . Fonseca intercepts me . " Release me , " I command . But his grip tightens . His breath smells like his yellow teeth . His grin is grim . I see my mother 's whispers in his eyes . " I command you to let me go , or I will summon my guards . " But his claw only tightens . " Guards , " I yell . But no guard appears . I hear them shuffling beneath the arch . " My father will hear of this . " But Fonseca is only laughing through his teeth , the color of snakes ' eyes . There is no help for it . " Felipe , " I shriek , and I throw myself against the gate . I bite the bar . The iron tastes like the blood dotting the corner of my mouth . Gotas son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gate . For pity , open the gate . " But no one comes . I watch my hands turn , grow ferrous , rusty . My heart is a red satin case , bleeding and bedecked with pearl-shaped tears . Cuchicheo . Cuchicheo . What do I care for your litany of whispers ? <p> See how she will not release the bars . Her hands are iron talons . Her hair has grown brambles . No one can pry her free . Day and night , that forsaken wailing . She is bound to make lunaticos de todos . Send for her mother . Bring Isabella . <p> " DO NOT BRING MY MOTHER . Felipe . Caro mio . Why does he not come ? Madre , is this duty ? " <p> See how she sucks her own blood . Si , supuesto es una bruja . I saw an owl last night twirl its head until it unscrewed . The head flew away . The body dropped into the courtyard and disappeared like a drop of blood into the stone . The stone hissed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They think me mad , but this is better than nothing . To lament . There is relief in grief . It is as far as my power flexes , to have sway over this hand , to command it to bleed , to weep for me . <p> " I extend my bloody hands to you . So are they cured by your doses of denying me my husband , my home , my right to command even myself . Will no one let me out ? Kyrie eleison . " <p> Hear how she calls to no one ? She speaks to the wind . And she thinks it answers . Her mother comes . She comes . <p> After Isabella pries her fingers from the bars , after the batlike whirling and keening subside , after the footsteps stumble and falter together across the courtyard ( Hush now , hush , child ) , the darkness spans over La Mota like great wings and the quiet alights , canny as crows . Los cuervos like to work in pairs . One to create diversion , the other to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness cocks an eye at the silence . " She will not see her mother again , " the night soughs . " I know , " the quiet forgets to answer . <p> " No es loca . " <p> " Ahora , no . " <p> " Y cuando ? " <p> " Tarde o temprano . " Later or sooner . <p> " Por seguro . " <p> Philip No one is worth this aggravation . This woman is another species , this one . She came home . She surprised me , yes , with my mistress . One in a long series . Where is the harm ? A man likes a tight bit . A nice wet morsel . These mothers grow slack . A man gets a taste for something pure now and then . My teeth have been hurting lately . I need a little diversion to ease the throbbing , a nice quaff of wine , a virgin or a virgin until recently . A glass or two , a maid or two , I forget my aches . So I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark one roars . My mistress has my note requesting the tryst in her hand , so she swallows it . Loyal girl . <p> " Will you palm your sin like a host ? " my wife screams , and then attacks my paramour . Screams . Scissors flashing . She chops her blond hair to the bleeding scalp . <p> I was amused for a moment . Women fighting . It is like chickens , really , all that pithless pother . But Juana was screaming about yellow hair : " Will you steal my husband 's hair for your bastard children ? " And the poor girl , standing there like meat a day beyond its desirability , now bald and bleeding , too . And crying . I hate to see a woman cry ; it distorts the face . The pretty thing was crying , so I struck her , struck Juana to the floor . It threw out my knee , of course , but I popped it back in place . The girl stopped crying . I smiled at her as the beauty relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I turned . <p> The scissors flew from Juana 's stunned hands as she fell against the floor . I dismissed my wife , but I summoned Martin de Moxica immediately to keep an eye on her . There were sensitivities to consider . <p> Moxica reported that she had surrounded herself with Moorish women . She has witchy ways . The attendants stroked and washed her hair with brewed nettles and poppy petals . They soothed her forehead and temples , anointing her with balms . They rubbed her body with oils and lotions , mixed potions for her , love elixirs . She intended to court me back . Silly woman  --  as if she 'd ever had me . She was a pretty little mite , yes . Eager in her appetite . But she was  --  just a wife , eh . So I dismissed her Moors . <p> This time the wretch flew at me . She is too bold , too wild . Sometimes I think she mistakes herself for a man . This is what comes of Queen Mothers . Some men admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cada loca con su tema . But your theme is not mine , dear wife . I knocked her against the wall and locked her in the room . She 'd learn . Leaving orders for her management , I went off for a few days to seek other amusements  --  preferably some diversions as yet unshorn . I deserve my pastimes . <p> Upon my return , Moxica reported that my wife had refused to eat during my absence . I was disgusted . Having a wife was more trouble than it was worth , Castile or Aragon . What did she want of me ? I retired to my chambers . All night she banged a rock on the floor , or gouged it with a knife , alternately pounding and chiseling . She wept as she begged me to admit her to my bedroom : " Por favor , mi esposo . Tenga merced . Misericordia . " And then she began to call , " Felipe . Are you there ? Are you there ? " How did she know the exact hour of my return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or too weak . She defies me or she bangs all night on my floor , begging me to bed her . Both breed contempt . <p> Juana la Despojada Es muerta , Mama , Mama es muerta . Around me , everything shifts . I can feel it . Power shifts . I hear it in the whispers , the unsaid . History is the life men would prefer to lead . I have no need of history ; I have this need : mi esposo . But he refuses me . He swears at me . He says he will never lie with me again . Never is a long time , but it is shorter than memory . I know I have not lost him ; I can not have lost him forever . What is a rock or a knife on the floor except proof of love ? He 'll come back , surely he will come back . He has left me . <p> I summoned the priest and confided about Felipe 's infidelities , how they rip me up , shred my heart . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What good is that to me ? My prayers go unanswered . Cold comfort . I have no need of priests or prayers . <p> But Mama ? Es muerta . Where is my father ? He wants my place ; he can have it . Moxica has reported me " unfit to rule . " What care I ? I wrote a letter to my father on Conchillos 's advice , begging him to rule in my stead . Felipe had Conchillos tortured until he wrote a letter of retraction . What care I ? I want my husband , not a crown . <p> And Moxica , that traitor , I dismissed him with my hand extended , my mother 's gesture . But he hovers , stays . My husband restores him . My husband , my husband . So my servants stay to mock me . <p> He dispatched them to remove me , to remove me from my remove to a farther remove . I have no authority , but I still have will . When that man , Frenoy , tried to lay hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I may have no sway , but my arms still have some . Frenoy received a lovely knighting on his brow . I gashed him . The result : I am still here , but my dear spouse has positioned guards in my antechamber . My privacy is now complete . I live behind my ungashed brow . I can not even use my chamberpot unobserved . But I am still the queen . I am unmoved . <p> Whispers in my antechamber . Do they think me stupid ? Deaf ? No , I have only suffered un gran alteracion . My mother , dead . My husband allied with Louis to prevent my father 's rule , and my father remarried to a hobbled and homely woman to thwart his design . Germaine de Foix . So love itself is altered . Allegiance , alliance , but nowhere loyalty or love . Everything is altered but me . I remain . I , the putatively altered . History , the script of men , does not care for my version . I remain . Oh , Madre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my storms . Temporales . But they have no effect . My storms rage in the glass castle . I am contained . Caged , I grow cagey . <p> Elsewhere , beyond los parapetos , there are other storms . They , the whispers , tell me that my husband is lost at sea , capsized in the Flemish fleet . How much reality has that for me ? He is already capsized in my heart . El Rey Don Felipe afloat with a leather sack to save him . I make my small votive donation . <p> " Have you ever heard of a king who drowned ? " The underbelly of my passion is a sharp-fanged rodent 's . Let him hang on as best he might ; he left me here adrift . My trousseau prefigured my drowning in this darkness that he mandated for me . Las tinieblas , the noun knows its gender . Lavabo , let the ocean cleanse him . " No , I never heard of a king who drowned . Una bruja quizas . " I wash my hands . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead , her eyes tearless , she who bore his children . Witness you how she rubs her hands together , rubbing and rubbing where there is no water . Do you think it is worry ? I think it is glee . The tides have strings , and she pulls them . The world is her funcion de titeres . <p> Idiota , she is only inhumana . Si ... o loca . <p> Do they think me deaf ? I make chords of their dropped notes . He beaches in England , signs many treaties . He wants a place in history and in my sister . Ai , no . Felipe , my sister ? Catalina . What treaty will you not forge ? Catalina ? I pray in my cathedral of whispers . It is not so , it is not so . My litany of disbelief . I beg , yes , even in my pride , I beg , at least restore me my clavichord . The mass is stale , the host turned papery and dry , but I might have music , red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Nada . I adopt a widow 's weeds . I will wear them till my husband returns . I wear black . I mutter for my husband until I can reclaim some state , and then , yes , then , the whispers say I may meet him in Exeter . Esposo . Husband . Hair unbound , I come to you . <p> And he came to me . Or to my bed . My father , my husband , my father . Fernand , Felipe , Fernand . It is true , I tried to arrange a journey to my father . I suspected intrigue . I was wise . They intercepted me . Why did my mother have so much sway , so much command ? Why am I again and again subject to the indignity of hands ? How can I flex my will ? I can eat or not eat , speak or not . I can pace and stare or not , command a retinue of deaf servants . They think me deaf . I am only a consequence of no consequence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against those who deem me of consequence . Consequence , sequence . It is all about ascension to the crown . Dunces . It is always about ascension ultimately . Crowned or uncrowned , we come we go . <p> See how she points her finger upward . Look , nothing is there . Nada alla . Perhaps she sees things we do not . Perhaps she sees beyond . <p> Que boba . <p> In reclusion again , I write my father . They say I am crazy , loca , Juana la Loca . Father . They mean to take Castile from you . I do not care about Castile . I care about my father . I do not care about They . I care about my husband . But my husband , is he they ? My father , is he they ? Let me see a man I love . Let me see . Las tinieblas . But I am contained . So I write . I write letters to my father . They are cautionary . They are love letters . They are ours . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarm and swoop in my brain . They move too fast , jittery like bats . First there 's one , there , no there , no that 's another , there , but it 's the same . Which they is that ? Which he is they who detain me ? Murcielagos . <p> I think they ( which they ? ) intercept my father 's letters . I think they have put me here ( which they ? ) . They ( who ? which ? ) think me crazy . But the admiral , he , he has been talking to me for years , at least ten years . He pronounced me sane . Murcielagos . Murcielagos . Lago y lago , y lago de leones . Lado a lado , por todos lados , me miran de lado . On all sides they stare . I drown in the lake of their stares . This drowning , it prefigures or recalls . It is an omen of the future or the past . I divine the birds . My thoughts compose clashing chords of language from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juana la Loca . La luna , te toca ? Si , toca la Loca . Sin manos . Sin boca . La Loca es loca . Epiteto , I am become my epithet . El guapo , por que ? <p> Domine non sum dignus . Domine non sum dignus . Domine sum dignus . I am worthy . <p> Dos Cuervos For three nights a comet flared through the desert sky . The winds hooted like owls . A red smudge appeared on the moon . Rats scuttled in the alleys . Day and night , two crows walked through the courtyard , baronial , proprietary , surveying what was theirs . Crows hold sway over all they survey . The crickets hushed to hear them as they passed . <p> " She is gone to Burgos . He has taken ill , " the first said . <p> The crow adjusted a wing . " No , no . He is dead . For three hours she hugged the body . They had to pry her from him . Her fingers were talons of grief . They sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfumes , then packed him in lime in a coffin of lead and wood . She did not cry . " <p> " She is becoming a crow . " <p> The whispers say , She is in Burgos , but see how she sends us her familiars . See how her winged black heart arches over us even in her absence . <p> Pedro Martir <p> She did not cry : " Por ya no saber que es el dolor . " But she sat with him . For her , sorrow was stasis , inertia . She was permitted nothing else . May I say , would it be indiscreet to suggest , that she continued to desire him ? Finally he could be nothing but faithful . But , still , she was jealous . Want thwarted always becomes obsession . She 'd known no other man . She wanted only this : returning love . It did not come . Alive , he was a silly man , confused by her passion . He did not know that  --  had he simply loved her in measure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited man , incapable of fidelity , of love . <p> Juana sat with him , kissed his cold lips . Painful to me to know that love like that , even arranged love , can exist . He was unworthy of that extremity of feeling . So she sat , in a funereally curtained room , head in hands . She did not weep ; her love was too pure for weeping . How can one lament what one has never had ? <p> She listened to the choirs , the chants , the minstrels , for solace . Music soothed her despair . <p> She deemed it impolite to sign , in her grief , the documents Cisneros produced . Love opposes politics . <p> " To stabilize a government ? Stabilize me . Have you no respect for love , for loss ? " <p> Cisneros assumed it a mark of her instability , insanity . <p> She spoke to the wind . But who is stable , sane , when you love what , who , can never be yours , when you love what gets arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me no papers . My signature ensures my incarceration . Permit me my grief . I can not sign . Where is my father ? Why do republics depend on the vulnerability of my grief ? I refuse to sign my name against my father  --  Juana la Loca . I will wait on my father . <p> While she waited , she commanded that no foreigners be permitted to hold office . <p> The plague was raging in and around Burgos , too much indulgence . Juana opened Felipe 's casket on All Saints ' Day to verify that he was hers . The day after souls flee . Her religion was a religion of desire . She could not have him alive ; she would have him dead . No seducers . Just the grave . She and death would have him . She bided in Burgos to avoid the procuradores and the nobles . <p> Then she moved . I can not censure her . Finally , passionately , incontrovertibly , he , the philanderer , was hers . <p> She was sane , just overly protective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , transported her beloved to Granada . Heartless in death as he had been in life . <p> The bishop demanded that the body not be moved for half a year . <p> Around her she heard the whispers of history tatting her net . Conspiracies . Always murmurs . She feared they would take Felipe from her , so again she opened the coffin . <p> The fog fell or exuded or crept as is its wont . Fog has a will and imagination of its own . The world softened . The paths became wet and strange . Four black Phrygian horses pulled the hearse . And she followed . How she followed . Large with his child , large with the child of their last passion , the passion desperate because he had told her he would come to her bed no more , would enjoy instead his goose-fatted blondes and plump thighs . She trundled behind the procession , heavy with child , large with her love for him . <p> In Torquemada , she stumbled . On February 14 she birthed , alone , Catalina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's design on Castile and her sister 's thighs . There is no decency between thighs . How did this woman find it in herself to love so depthlessly this wretched man ? <p> Walls tormented her . She had a fear , rightly inherited , of walls . In Torquemada they walled her . She found a desperate solace in a mortuary cult . She asked one of the monks of Miraflores , " Do you think he could come back ? Might he come back ? " <p> He answered , " With faith , all is possible . " <p> She prayed in flickering light , the candlewicks so charred that the room grew black with soot . The body moldered . She fell in love with decay . She prayed above the guttering votive candles . <p> She was hoping for an answer , an answer beyond the grave , but dead men do n't speak . The world fell into disarray . The chain of being kinked . <p> The premature cold gave way to unseasonable warmth . The violets bloomed in January . Disease blossomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cawed . In April she resumed her funeral procession , opening the coffin again to be certain that Felipe remained hers , and again when she learned that her father was coming . Still there , yes . In death , Felipe el Fiel . <p> They reunited in Tortoles . She fell to her knees and kissed her father 's feet . So trusting , she signed her government over to him and , again , was betrayed . He , too , left her . Isolate , in Arcos , she brooded , doubly grieving . For Felipe , for her father 's abandonment . Why ? Why ? she asked the walls . But they did not answer . <p> She ordered torches for the church and sat with Felipe 's corpse , inching her estrado ever closer until her face was smudged with soot , her eyes unnaturally white and bewildered in her dark face . <p> Her father notified her of his desire to ally her in marriage to Henry VII . She cried for days . She did not want to disobey , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , " she responded , " I can not marry while my husband is unburied . " <p> Ferdinand scolded her for her grief . " It is unseemly . It is profligate . " <p> But her sorrow would not abate . Her grief had become her love . She was unrelenting . Ferdinand ordered her sequestered in Tordesillas . So she became legend  --  the crazy queen . It would be her cell for forty-six years , a castle of waste . She proclaimed her loyalty , her sacrifice , to her father . He responded by taking her son , his namesake . She sobbed , she stammered . From her window , she surveyed the troops around Tordesillas . She did not command even her own will . She sank into stuporous despair . She was twenty-nine years old and captive . She dressed sloppily . She refused to attend mass , refused to eat , sleep , bathe , change her clothes . These were her small acts of rebellion . What else remained her except to slap her insubordinates ? But they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her home : a mazy , grim castle . Her one-windowed view , a slice of cobbled street , a dry ditch , a drawbridge . And Luis Ferrer for her jailer . <p> Ferrer moved her to another chamber so she could not see the corridor or gallery . Rooms within rooms . She refused to go  --  she had a fear of interiors  --  but he summoned the guards , and they relocated her by force . He ordered that Felipe 's body be moved to a cave of Clarist nuns . Juana wept . " Him , too ? Must you take mi esposo from me , too ? " Jealous in death as she had been in life , she did not want him in the care of women . <p> Thus was her reclusion perfected . Loca ? Not yet . But almost . Soon . <p> Spies reported her condition to Ferdinand , but he would not be satisfied until he had thoroughly humiliated her by arriving with a retinue , unannounced . <p> Still she was canny . She heard the horses ' hooves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . Too late : she was interrupted only half-clothed . But still proud , her eyes flashed with cold fire , hard as diamond . Brilliant , yet . Her father left her to her isolation . What she did not know of the world beyond her tower : <p> That Ferdinand , afraid of Charles , strove for a son , an heir , with his homely wife , Germaine . <p> That on Easter Sunday 1512 , foot soldiers bloodied Ravenna . <p> That the Pope , Ferdinand , and Venice forged the Holy Alliance against Louis . <p> That a nun gave birth under a red moon to an infant with squamous legs , the prick of a dog , the head of a lion , and wings black as a bat 's . <p> That Germaine boiled down bull 's testicles to feed her husband , an aphrodisiac that they might yet produce an heir . <p> That he drank the potency potion . <p> That he took ill . <p> That he died . <p> That she became Queen of Aragon . <p> That her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his death . <p> That the citizens revolted and surrounded Ferrer in his house . <p> That her husband 's head was lime . <p> That Juan de Avila , her confessor , in a twinge of conscience wanted to tell her all this , but could not . The attendants closed in on him . <p> That Ferrer was evicted from Tordesillas . <p> That the lizards lazed in the courtyard sun . That wheels clattered over the cobbles . That an uncertain peace , like a swarm of butterflies , settled on Tordesillas . <p> And Juana , walled and alone , could only wonder , wonder while Cisneros , unknown to her , proclaimed her son , Charles , the king of Spain . <p> But there is this little problem , you see . Juana is still alive . <p> Two years after Ferdinand 's death , Charles sails from Flanders , arriving in Tordesillas in November . He is a homely man , slack-jawed like his father , tall and thin like his mother , but gnarled , twisted . His eyes protrude . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loll strangely in his mouth and impede his speech . <p> So he stood before her , the son she had not seen . <p> " Madam , your son , the king , is come . " <p> " My son is a prince ; I am the queen . " <p> He addressed her in French ; she answered in Spanish . <p> He bowed low to her . She smirked at him , at his coterie of obsequiousness . <p> He offered his " honor , obedience , and respect . " <p> She merely nodded . " You think you are my son , the son of El Guapo . " She marveled at the lapse of time . " You must be tired . " So she dismissed him . <p> Not knowing that her father was dead , she granted Charles the right to rule in his stead and thereby sealed herself in deeper isolation . To ensure her instability , Charles had his men sneak up on the little Catalina where she played , her eleven braids whipping the air as the men smuggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared out her window . She refused food until Charles returned her daughter . But he returned her with a placement of troops around Tordesillas . <p> History repeated . Twice betrayed by father , by son . Her children kidnapped . Husband , father , son . Again she sank . <p> Charles ordered Tordesillas closed . For weeks Juana would not speak . Then she interrupted the mass , ordered that the altar be disassembled . She regretted her decision to grant Charles sway . A desire for freedom and for her rule stirred in her . She roused with a longing to go see Felipe at the convent of Santa Clara . She made plans to move to Valladolid . <p> The spies reported her sudden lucidity , so Charles installed Denia in her chamber to drive the woman mad . She was not crazy yet . Almost . Soon . <p> Denia 's campaign : <p> He denied her doctors when her teeth hurt . <p> He took her jewels and clothes and gave them to his wife and daughter . <p> He meted out her money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He appointed only female attendants , knowing her hatred of women . <p> When she donated four hundred rations of bread , he reduced them to twelve . <p> Around her he wove a net of half-truths and lies and puzzles . <p> He impugned her father until she made vigorous defense . <p> He used her letters as proof of her insanity : " See , she composes letters to the dead . " But she did not know that her father was dead . <p> She did not know . <p> He told her Emperor Maximilian was alive . <p> She lived in a room . She lived in a room within a room with her adviser , whom she could not trust , such that she could not distinguish the living from the dead , the enthroned from the entombed . Doubt nibbled at her . Misdoubt , mistrust , misgiving . How did she know what she knew ? Again she pondered , spent " un gran rato pensado . " <p> Then she shook herself into a tantrum , smashed her dishes against the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuous again ; she became listless and suspicious . So she provided Charles proof of her insanity . <p> He demanded a letter granting him the right to rule . <p> Ferdinand was fifteen years dead , Maximilian four . Charles had set up his government in Avila , where the people rose in revolt . But all this Juana does not know . For fifteen years , she has lived with the deceit . <p> The president of the Council requested an audience . He presented an order to sign , an order dissolving the junta . But she , so long lied to , did not know how to recognize the truth . She demurred , crippled by indecisiveness . Too many papers . What good had her signature ever purchased her ? <p> The Comunero army was already on the march . The castle , so long dormant , stirred with the bustle of servants and soldiers . Trumpets blared over the courtyard . Viva Juana . Viva . Viva . And Padilla , Bravo , and Zapata knelt before her in sworn allegiance , kissing her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were wet . <p> First , she struck Charles 's name from all official documents . Then she ousted Denia , her tormentor . <p> But she faltered . Again , the suspicions . The misgivings . Whom could she trust ? She pronounced her food " stale and corrupt . " She would not sleep . She suspected they were poisoning her . She refused to receive anyone and would only communicate through her door . <p> The Comuneros summoned a priest to exorcise her evil spirits . They lied to her , threatened . They would immure her . They would starve her . <p> Then Haro attacked Tordesillas . <p> The sky rained stones . A boulder breached the wall . The wall , her hated wall , buckled . Soldiers wore uniforms of fire . Amid licking flames , Juana strode across the southern gallery , her black dress smoking , hands twisting . Some soldiers removed her to the patio . She had only one lucid thought : Felipe . She must save her husband . She broke away to the convent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she could not wheel him home . The cart was rotten , desbaratado . The sides gave way . <p> The town was taken . The cannon fire shook the ground . The convent shuddered . Smoke rose in dark plumes . Corpses littered the streets . When Juana returned to the palace , the courtyard was deserted . She had two thoughts : Catalina and her jewel box . Only they remained to be salvaged . She gained the patio and then .. , and then ... She stopped . She just stopped . <p> The Royalists found her there , vacant , still . They led her back up to her room . Her world burned to rubble below her , she huddled on the floor , not caring , not knowing anything but this : She was unloved . Profoundly unloved . Nothing mattered . Felipe , dead . Her father and mother , dead . Her children , taken from her . Her son , a traitor . Her throne and name , usurped . <p> Denia returned to her torment . She would inhabit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plays cruel jokes , letting one with so meager a life live so long . The Queen of Castile lived seventy-six years . Bread and cheese appeared at the door to her oubliette . She hid the terra-cotta dishes or hurled them against the wall , laughing a horripilating laugh . <p> Felipe 's coffin was moved to Granada . Even in death he found a way to be unfaithful . Catalina was betrothed to the king of Portugal , and Denia allowed Juana to watch the wedding procession . She stood at the window gallery , crying , hands soldered to the iron reja , staring and standing for hours after it had passed , clinging as she once had to the bars at La Mota , demanding her husband . Watching as she once watched her own procession , the plump burghers dancing in the streets , the floral garlands . Christ on a ceiling . A collapsed bridge . <p> She had clear moments . When Charles appropriated her jewels , she turned on him and said , " I gave you my kingdom . Must you ransack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they were only moments . Loca , now . <p> She subsided into memories , shadowy images , fluttery presences . Day and night women sat vigil , stationed by her door , enforcing her reclusion . But once she broke out long enough to scream from a window , " Kill . Kill . Mate . Mate . " But so many were dead already . <p> She was , at long last , mad . It may have been a blessing . Consciousness of her sad life would be torture . Knowledge would be a form of damnation . She slipped away under dark currents . She was already dead . Her body did n't know it yet . Time , the cruel prankster , played on . That is the history of Juana la Loca , but it is not her story . <p> Juana la Muerta She is seventy years old . Her dreams fulfilled , she is imprisoned in madness , drowning in madness . She is lost to time . Her widow 's weeds have decayed until they look like a tattered second skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a nest of wrinkles . Her white hair , a mat of knots , crawls with lice . But her eyes burn very bright , burn holes through the here , the now , burn peepholes through time , darkness , the grave . She sees cats slink into the corners , gnaw on her mother 's body . Witches snap graveclothes at her , ushering in processions of dead souls who wind around and around her room . Flagellants . She follows them with her eyes . She falls into deep trances , converses with Felipe . Sometimes she spreads her old thighs wide and makes love to him . She has found a way to travel , to go where she wishes . She has found a way to flex her will , a way to command the world . Her lunacy knows no constraint of time or space . <p> Her castle is a place time has forgotten . Grass grows over the courtyards . Owls haunt the almenas . The desert wind whistles through the turrets . The battlements crumble and tilt . <p> Her women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and legs . But the water is too hot . Inadvertently , they scald her . Her blisters fester . The women try herbs , ointments , but the sores pustulate , suppurate . She is feverish . A blister on her left buttock darkens to black . The doctor comes in the night to cauterize it with irons . The room smells of pestilence , burned flesh , blood , suppressed screams . Juana la Vieja begs , " No more . " <p> She can not eat . A sore appears on her other buttock . The sores ooze , turn gangrenous . <p> The women summon Francisco Borgia . She complains to him : " Please dismiss these women . They steal my missal from me . They piss in the holy water . " <p> He will not . She refuses the Eucharist . Fray Domingo de Soto arrives , his hassock muddied by the wet roads , to perform extreme unction . Borgia confesses her . Her sins are as small as the world she has inhabited for seventy-six years . Domingo applies the chrism : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Together they recite the credo . Then she slips away , drops into a further darkness , coma . The priests wait . <p> She starts , shudders . She strikes her withered breasts . <p> And then she cries . Once . It is a solitary cry , the cry of a captive animal , a cry that funnels through the labyrinthine castle , a cry never meant to be heard . A cry suppressed her life long . It rises . Juana ascending . The fires and the whispers are put out . <p> And when the sixth hour was come , there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour . And at the ninth hour , Jesus cried with a loud voice , Eloi , Eloi , llama sabachthani ? My God , my God , why hast thou forsaken me ? <p> She cried , " Christ crucified , help me . " Arms wide , she yielded up the spirit . <p> It was 6:00 A.M. Good Friday . A gilt crucifix spanned the ceiling of her dreams . She opened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death is a faithful , patient lover . <p> The two old priests press her eyelids closed . <p> In the courtyard , the crows hold caucus . <p> " She is gone . " <p> " La Loca , yes . She has become a crow . " <p> " Es una leyenda ahora . " <p> " Yes , but legends often lie . Juana la Loca sin manos , sin boca . Our stories betray us . " <p> " She was not crazy . " <p> " Who 's to say ? It depends on which side of the veil you stand on . " <p> " But history knots truths of its lies . " <p> " She wanted only to love the yellow-haired . Waste . " <p> " What might she have been had she been permitted to be other ? " <p> The crow fixes his partner with an unblinking eye . " She wanted only to love . Her heart was a red satin case studded with teardrop pearls . She wanted only to love . " <p> " But she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the crow snaps up the leg of a dead rabbit . <p> The two flap off over the towers of Tordesillas , where Juana la Loca rises quietly from her body . The whispers , the intrigues , fade behind her . She can hear them no more . The chants and litanies fall mute . Behind her she leaves a castled history and a charred courtyard that she haunts , commanding the stones to speak and the dead to rise . A woman of power . She has fallen off the edge of the world . Like Columbus , she navigates the stars . <p> Sed libera nos a malo . <p> No one laments her . She is become history . She is become her name . <p> And it is done . <p> <p> By Joan Connor <p>
