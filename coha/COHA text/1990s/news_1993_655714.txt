<p> THE ground may still be covered with snow in some areas of the United States , but gardeners who have been studying the seed catalogs since Christmas are anxious to begin planting . <p> " Slow-germinating seeds can be started indoors now , but the frost-free date for my planting zone is April 15 , so I wo n't start tomatoes and peppers and basil until April 1 , " says Jack Delmond , award-winning gardener in Boston 's Fenway Victory Gardens . <p> Mr. Delmond has already started daylily and iris seeds and also the unusual Italian vegetable cardoon . <p> " In the spring I 'll get some potted seedlings - a six-pack of different varieties of vegetables or flowers , depending on what looks like good quality in the garden centers . " <p> Delmond 's system is ideal . Although most gardeners are itching to start , it 's best to remember how easy it is to stop by the local garden center and pick up pre-potted seedlings of tomatoes and herbs . <p> Better still , make a check of seed companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your doorstep at the proper time for planting in your area . <p> " Do n't start your indoor seeds too early , " cautions Roger B. Swain , Science Editor of Horticulture Magazine and host of PBS 's The Victory Garden show . " This is one of the most frequent mistakes made when starting seeds inside , " Mr. Swain says . <p> To determine the correct date for planting , check with a local garden center or agricultural county agent on the first frost-free date expected in your area . Then plant tomato seeds eight weeks back from this date , squash and cucumbers four weeks back , basil four to six weeks back . <p> " If you start them too early for your region you 'll get long , leggy , weak plants , " Swain says . " Germinating is just getting the plant out of the ground . Once germinated , they then need a cool , bright atmosphere . " <p> " Celery , dandelions , garden cress , lettuce , mustard , and witloof chicory , all need light to sprout , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will germinate in the dark providing they are kept moist . Remember that seedlings in small pots wo n't last even a weekend without watering . " <p> As for transferring seedlings outdoors , it 's disastrous to move them suddenly . All indoor seedlings must be gradually acclimated to life outdoors , a process called " hardening off , " Swain explains . The small plants need to adjust to the colder temperatures and also to the brighter light . <p> Plan to start hardening off your seedlings ( by exposing them to the outdoors for increasingly longer increments of time each day ) at least two weeks before you intend to plant them , Swain advises . <p> Although selling seeds is the business of W. Atlee Burpee Co. , the well-known seed company reports substantial increases in selling via mail order plants already started in pots . <p> Lee Strassburger , who has been with Burpee 's for 15 years , says sales of ready-to-plant vegetables and flowers have increased 15 to 20 percent . This year , the company offers bedding plants delivered to the door at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . Plants are shipped so they arrive at the end of the week , ready for weekend planting , a big help to busy gardeners . <p> " All of our bedding-plant customers buy seeds as well , " Mr. Strassburger says . But buying plants already started is the big trend . Everybody 's busy , and it saves time . " <p> Today 's gardeners are also interested in new varieties . One of the new seed-company owners , Renee Shepherd of Shepherd 's Garden Seeds , specializes in European vegetables in particular . She also offers recipes in the company 's catalog . <p> Wendy Krupnick , a seed-variety trials coordinator at Shepherd 's ( based in California ) , says they work closely with specific European , Asian , and American seed houses in choosing only those varieties that are disease-resistant , easy to grow , and have a fine flavor and texture . <p> " We look for the best fresh-eating qualities and find many of our best seeds from European growers who are smaller and closer to their customers and who place value on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Like our green-shouldered tomatoes : Many are of French origin and have the ' green gene , ' which makes them stay green longer . " <p> " Dona and Carmello are good French tomatoes and Enchantment is a brand-new tomato , which is egg-shaped like the Roma but is firm and juicy and good for thick sauces as well as perfect slices , " Krupnick says . <p> Others new this year : a Salsa collection including recipes as well as seeds for Poblano , Habanero , and Jalapeno chilies ; Dona tomatoes ; Slo-Bolt cilantro ; and tomatillos . <p> Shepherd 's answers many problems gardeners have with certain varieties like the cilantro or coriander ( Coriandrum sativum ) that is slow to bolt ( turn to seed ) , and the Dukat dill that was bred in Finland with blue-green thick feathery leaves that hold at the leaf stage . <p> " Of course , we 're also proud of our lettuces and greens like Japanese mizuna , mache , arugula , and radicchio , slender French beans , and Italian Chioggia striped beets , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lacinato kale , is unique in color , is two feet tall , and so primeval-looking we nicknamed it ' dinosaur kale . ' " <p> " A new Japanese green with white blossoms called Gailon is a very delicate broccoli that will look absolutely beautiful in your garden , " Krupnick says . " <p> Looking beautiful in the garden is important in today 's small vegetable plots . <p> The expert on this subject is Rosalind Creasy , who has written extensively on " edible landscaping . " <p> In her book " Cooking From the Garden " ( Sierra Club Books , 1988 ) , Ms. Creasy gives both recipes and full planting instructions for such gardens as a baked-bean garden , rainbow garden , spa garden , gourmet herb , edible flower and salad garden , and Cajun garden . She also tells how to plant native American gardens , as well as Italian , French , German , Mexican , and Oriental gardens with a long chapter on each . <p> Georgeanne Brennan 's idea of the best way to have really fresh food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the word for soup , which is similiar to the American " kitchen garden . " <p> " A kitchen garden 's purpose is to supply the kitchen , on a daily basis , with as much year-round produce as possible , " says Ms. Brennan , author of " Potager : Fresh Garden Cooking in the French Style " ( Chronicle Books , 1992 , $ 29.95 , $ 18.95 soft cover ) . " Although Americans grow food in the garden in summer and store it up for the winter , by freezing and other methods , many other countries keep the garden going into the cold weather . <p> " In Russia , recently , I saw many gardens growing the cold-hardy vegetables in winter , heaped with straw and perhaps other mulches . We could grow foods in cold areas of the United States , too ... Kale and cabbages grow in very cold weather as well as Brussels sprouts , parsnips , carrots and more . There are vast areas for Americans to explore even for a small 10-by-12-foot plot , " says Brennan . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have a built-in variation to cooking , " Brennan continues . <p> " Without even having to think about it , you 'll learn what it is to cook things as they grow and change in their own lifecycles , from early spring to late fall into winter . <p> " You learn the differences in ripeness almost without thinking of it .
