Section : Blacks and the GOP <p> For once , Republicans have a chance to uphold principle and advance their interests at the same time ' wooing black voters back to the party of Abraham Lincoln by defeating a civil-rights bill . <p> A month or so ago , during a conversation about the Kennedy-Hawkins civil-rights bill , I made two bets with Arch Parsons of the Baltimore Sun . First , that President Bush will veto the bill if it is approved without significant changes . Second , that he will win 18 per cent of the black vote in 1992 if he does . <p> Washington pundits would assure Arch that he 'll soon pocket a crisp dollar bill from the first bet , and a second one too if his memory hangs in for two years . Moreover , most pundits would insist that my first bet is inconsistent with my second . If Bush vetoes this civil-rights bill  --  or any civil-rights bill  --  he 's doomed among black voters . <p> The reason I 'm bucking conventional wisdom is that I sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the civil-rights bill . That leads me to believe that if Bush plays his cards right , he will in fact double the black vote he received in 1988  --  a development that would make him invincible in 1992 . And  --  again contrary to popular wisdom  --  playing his cards right requires him to veto the bill if Congress passes anything resembling the original version . <p> At a Rose Garden ceremony on May 17 , Bush laid down three conditions for acceptance of a civil-rights bill : it ca n't require or encourage racial quotas , it ca n't be absurdly complex , and it ca n't reverse the due-process principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty . These are refreshing , common-sense principles that most Americans can easily support . <p> By definition , the bill 's sponsors can not satisfy those principles . The heart of the bill  --  provisions overturning six Supreme Court decisions of last year , especially the Wards Cove decision  --  violates all three . The motive behind it is to induce employers to adopt quotas " voluntarily " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Wards Cove , plaintiffs may use statistics to prove discrimination , but they bear the burden of proof every step of the way . Under Kennedy-Hawkins , statistics by themselves would establish a presumption of discrimination , with employers bearing the burden of proving their innocence . Facing that threat , employers would almost always seek the safe harbor of informal quotas . No middle ground exists : to modify or overturn Wards Cove is to create an irresistible impulse for quotas . Of course , anyone who has read the newspapers lately has every right to be skeptical about Bush 's resolve . Scooping the Democrats <p> Just after the Supreme Court issued its Wards Cove ruling , the White House called me to ask for ideas for a " Civil Rights Act of 1989 . " Amazingly , the Bush Administration wanted to scoop the Democrats . Hooray ! I thought ; our time has come at last , after eight years of the Reagan Administration 's benign neglect of opportunities to fashion a genuine civil-rights strategy based on individual rather than group rights . <p> I urged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I suggested that the President immediately appoint a highly credible commission on economic mobility , headed by someone like Tom Kean ( who received over half the black vote when he won re-election as governor of New Jersey in 1985 ) . In terms of strengthening civil-rights laws , he could add compensatory and punitive damages for victims of egregious discrimination ( as an alternative to quotas , which help not known victims but a whole class of presumed victims ) . Finally , and most importantly , he could urge legislative action on educational choice , economic opportunity , and anti-crime measures aimed at helping minorities . <p> As it turned out , Bush had plenty of time to devise such a strategy if he had wanted to , since it took Ted Kennedy and Ralph Neas , a top lobbyist for the civil-rights establishment , over half a year to come up with a bill to overturn the six Court rulings . But Bush did nothing , announcing that no action was necessary with respect to the recent Court decisions . <p> Meanwhile , several House Republicans got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshman Representative Tom Campbell , a bright and ambitious California Republican who wanted to establish his civil-rights credentials . He convinced several conservatives to join him , but when they realized they had been co-sponsoring a quota bill , they abandoned Campbell and demanded the White House provide an alternative . <p> The Administration obliged , but the product did not quite meet the standards of a viable alternative . The Administration bill proposed to overturn two of the six decisions targeted by Kennedy-Hawkins , while keeping Wards Cove intact . But the way the Administration sliced it , the law would make monetary damages available to victims of racial harassment but not sexual harassment . No one  --  liberals , conservatives , or the business community  --  liked that alternative . The point man for the bill , Don Ayer , could n't defend it , a factor that may have contributed to his recent departure from the Justice Department . <p> But the other side was having its problems too . After the Court 's decisions came down last June 16 , the NAACP 's Ben Hooks threatened widespread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the troops failed to heed the call , Hooks was forced to reclassify the mass rally as a more modest " silent vigil , " which registered barely a blip on the evening news . <p> It also took considerable effort by Neas and his allies to satisfy the diverse strands of the civil-rights lobby , with constituency groups ranging from minorities to feminists to labor unions , all focusing on different objectives which Neas had to put into a single , saleable package . Once introduced , the bill failed to generate much enthusiasm . Until the inexplicable decision by Senator Jack Danforth ( R. , Mo. ) on May 17 to join the bill , sponsors included only liberals and the usual maverick Republicans . Southern Democrats were lying low , perhaps haunted by the quota specter , which could bleed away white votes . By mid June , the bill had fewer than fifty Senate sponsors , a very low number for a civil-rights bill . Re-Enter the President <p> Enter the President again . On May 14 , he announced through his spokesman , Marlin Fitzwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that his differences with Kennedy-Hawkins were minor . He scheduled three days of meetings with civil-rights leaders , along with a sprinkling of dissenters . The Washington Post reported that he was ready to sign the bill , sending conservatives and the business community into despair . <p> Both sides were invited to the Rose Garden ceremony on Thursday of that week ; but when the rhetorical smoke had cleared , it was the bill 's supporters who were devastated . Instead of endorsing the bill , Bush reiterated his opposition to quotas and implied that he would veto the bill if his core principles were not satisfied . <p> Of course , the President could do an other pirouette and sign the bill . His Rose Garden reversal , apparently the result of a last-minute blitz by Attorney General Richard Thornburgh and other top advisors , may prove little more than a negotiating ploy . He clearly still wants to sign a bill and subsequently has negotiated with Kennedy , leading most commentators to suggest he 'll sign the bill with merely cosmetic alterations . But I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotas , he will risk losing support among white voters and creating additional constituencies for the likes of David Duke . So Bush needs to appear firm . But if he vetoes the bill , wo n't he write off any chance of increasing his share of the black vote ? Here 's where the pundits have it wrong . <p> Ben Hooks and his allies have declared the civil-rights bill a " litmus test " for Bush , and threaten he 'll get no black votes if he vetoes it . Ronald Reagan capitulated to such threats on several occasions ( such as housing and voting rights ) , and he still did n't end up with many black votes . Richard Nixon tried a different approach  --  out-liberaling the liberals on minority set-asides and the like and he did n't get many black votes either . Maybe President Bush has learned something from this . <p> The answer may lie in the second half of his Rose Garden speech  --  the half the media did n't report . Bush called for a new vision on civil rights based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor people help themselves . He spoke specifically about education vouchers , tenant management and ownership of public housing , and day care . <p> It was just a sketch , but it could turn into a real strategy , and one that could finally break the sixty-year Democratic lock on the black vote . If this seems a bold prediction , consider the objective : we 're not talking about competing for a majority of black votes , at east not initially , but rather for a mere doubling of the 9 per cent of the black vote that Bush received in 1988 . That 's only about one out of every ten blacks who did n't vote for him the first time . Assuming Bush can hold onto most of his white voter base ( and a quota-bill veto would help ) , this modest increase in black support is all he 'd need virtually to ensure his reelection by a wide margin ; if Republicans generally could duplicate the feat , it could lead to control of the Senate . A Nod to Hooks <p> This would represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give occasional nods to Ben Hooks , avoiding the remoteness , hostility even , of the Reagan era . But Bush  --  or at least his advisors  --  seems to realize that Hooks needs him more than vice versa . The civil-rights establishment responds to every problem with a new bill , and if it ca n't get one passed , it has nothing to offer its constituents . <p> Likewise , if Bush merely meets Hooks 's present demands , he 's got nothing over the Democrats , who will always be able to offer more in the way of government regulations and handouts . Hence , Bush should take his case directly to black voters , offering them policies that will really make a difference to their lives . <p> As with many political shifts , this one started with the academics . Scholars such as Thomas Sowell , Walter Williams , and Charles Murray all condemned the welfare state and race-conscious affirmative action as doing nothing to help blacks make economic advances . Their indictment of race-conscious measures was echoed by converts  --  James Coleman , Nathan Glazer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , including William Julius Wilson and Harvard law professor Randall Kennedy , who remain unabashedly liberal . <p> In particular , Wilson 's The Truly Disadvantaged ( 1987 ) demonstrated that race preferences helped mainly those who did n't need the help , while leaving unaddressed problems of economic mobility and development of human capital . Wilson 's book made it acceptable for thoughtful liberals to question race-conscious strategies as a solution to problems of minorities . <p> Kennedy-Hawkins has run head on into this burgeoning skepticism . Commentators across the political spectrum are recognizing the bill as a turning point , presenting a clear choice between continuing down the road of quotas or embarking on a new direction for civil rights . William Raspberry , Charles ' Krauthammer , Edwin Yoder , Stuart Taylor of Legal Times , the Christian Science Monitor , and The New Republic , all of them sympathetic to civil-rights aims , have each editorialized against the bill or its underlying logic . Likewise , the moderate Democratic Leadership Council , meeting this spring in New Orleans , explicitly endorsed the goal of equal opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premise that lies at the heart of Kennedy-Hawkins . <p> Meanwhile , this skepticism is manifesting itself at the grassroots . The NAACP 's membership rolls are hemorrhaging  --  it lost a hundred thousand over the past ten years . Were it not for ever-increasing corporate contributions , the venerable organization would have to close up shop . <p> Self-help groups , on the other hand , are flourishing . Though typically nonideological , they are passionately committed to individual autonomy and are therefore potentially ripe for Republican courtship . Exemplified by Robert Woodson 's National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise , these groups reject welfare and quotas in favor of individual and community initiative . A new civil-rights bill means absolutely nothing to these people , but such initiatives as enterprise zones , tenant management , and education vouchers can mean a great deal . <p> My own organization , the Landmark Center for Civil Rights , is a legal arm of the empowerment movement , challenging regulatory barriers to entrepreneurial opportunities and defending empowerment efforts where they are attacked by entrenched interests . After two years in this business , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political realignment . <p> Bertha Gilkey , a tenant-management activist in St. Louis , used to be a Black Panther . Now she sees liberals as her principal adversaries and Republicans as allies . In Wisconsin , black state Representative Polly Williams recently pushed through the nation 's first-ever education-voucher program , which ( if it survives legal challenge ) will provide one thousand poor Milwaukee children the chance to attend high-quality nonsectarian private schools . Mrs. Williams , Jesse Jackson 's Wisconsin campaign coordinator , joined forces with conservative Republican Governor Tommy Thompson to overcome efforts by white liberals to defeat the voucher proposal . She leaves little doubt whom she 'll support in the upcoming gubernatorial campaign . <p> Some in the Bush Administration ( such as Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp , Equal Employment Opportunity Commission Chairman Evan Kemp , and EEOC Vice Chairman Rosalie Silberman ) and their supporters in Congress ( Representatives Steve Bartlett and Newt Gingrich ) have taken note of the political potential of empowerment . My bets with Arch Parsons are based on the premise that Bush has noticed it too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among blacks and therefore carries significant veto risks , this bill , because of its complexity , simply wo n't set the grassroots on fire . If Bush ends up going toe to toe with Ben Hooks in the inner city , for once it will be the Republicans who offer the tangibles ( vouchers , tenant management , etc. ) while the civil rights establishment argues about abstractions ( burdens of proof , statistical inferences , and so on ) . <p> Thus far , many civil-rights groups are ambivalent about empowerment initiatives . The head of the Milwaukee NAACP chapter , for instance , has joined the teachers ' unions in taking Polly Williams 's education-choice program to court  --  a lawsuit my group is actively resisting on behalf of black parents and their children . This leaves the road clear for Bush to emerge as the " empowerment " President . No-Lose Issue <p> Republicans in recent years have run away from this issue , which is odd since it is a no lose issue . For once , Republican principles and interests are coinciding , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape . <p> My own objective is to promote a new agenda ; my principal venue is the courtroom , not the legislature . The political ramifications are secondary to me . But if George Bush decides to carry the empowerment banner , it might just advance the cause by twenty years or so  --  and quite possibly bring America closer to making good on its commitment of opportunity for all Americans . <p> That 's fine with me  --  and besides , I 'll be two bucks richer . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Clint Bolick <p> <p> Mr. Bolick is director of the Landmark Legal Foundation Center for Civil Rights in Washington , D.C. , and author of the forthcoming Unfinished Business : A Civil Rights Strategy for America 's Third Century ( Pacific Research Institute ) . <p>
