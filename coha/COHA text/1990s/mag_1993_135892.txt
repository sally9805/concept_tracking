Yes , we believe Todd Ewen of Anaheim 's Mighty Ducks might have a place in children 's literature . Ever read Where the Wild Things Are ? This guy , muscled and malevolent , is 6 ' 2 " , weighs 220 pounds and is a sort of grim fairy tale himself . Ewen , who puts the Might in the Ducks , is everybody 's bad ending , the guy who makes the Grinch seem good-hearted. // The 27-year-old Ewen has been around the NHL eight years now , an enforcer who racks up penalty minutes with a frightening nonchalance . Todd Ewen is why children and hockey players draw their sheets over their heads at night . Maybe he 'll just go away . // So it 's very strange to learn that Ewen is writing and illustrating a children 's fable , called A Frog Named Hop , in which the principal characters are a guitar-playing amphibian and a helpful dragonfly named Whisper . The story , aimed at preschoolers , teaches tolerance for things that are different . The thrills in the tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's a goon  --  who does n't get all this happy nonsense at the water 's edge until Whisper brings everyone and everything together . Todd Ewen , NHL tough guy , is writing this ? " Life is funny , " he says . // In fact , Ewen is not an ogre . His career with the St. Louis Blues , the Montreal Canadiens and now with the expansion team owned by the Walt Disney Company certainly implies that he is not a man to be trifled with . Last season he had 193 penalty minutes with Montreal ; this year he has accumulated 82 for the 10-18-2 Ducks . But the style does not describe the man . When the subject of his on-ice mayhem is raised , he actually becomes apologetic . " I have a role , " he says almost sadly . // Not everyone from Saskatoon is a Wayne Gretzky , and Ewen was quick to realize it . The most passionate of hockey players  --  and he is desperate for the sport  --  are willing to bend their game into whatever shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to stay in the game . There were a lot better skaters who did n't keep up with him through the juniors . But there 's hockey , and there 's real life . " People are disappointed when I do n't break down doors , " he says . " But that 's not me . " He would rather keep his own door closed , drawing gentle cartoons on the art panels with which he always travels . // He has had no artistic training and is often frustrated by making up for lost time . For example , he says , " I would love to draw comics , but how do you create action in the figures ? I 'd like to learn these things without turning my eraser into a thin little wafer . " So far experience has been his only teacher . // As for inspiration , that came from former Canadien teammate Ryan Walter , who has written several unpublished children 's books . Here , thought Ewen , was a place for his growing gallery of doodles , which he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , as the father of two small boys , Ewen realizes that there is always room for more children 's literature . He also believes that everyone ought to have a way to express his own values . " I 'm that old-time , white-picket-fence kind of person , " he says . " I wanted to put those values forth . " // When the book is finished , Ewen plans to market it on his own , without the aid of Disney . He insists on independence for his little story . " It has to stay mine , " he says . In the meantime he wades through the NHL tough guys , all of whom know about his off-ice abilities . " Nobody teases me much , " he says , although he remembers one hockey hoodlum sputtering some kind of insult , saying , " Sit down and paint me a picture . " Good one ! Is n't it nice to know that with Ewen in the NHL , the worst thing one gunslinger can say to the other is " Draw ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
