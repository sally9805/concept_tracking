It 's an old debate among husbands and wives : how many children to have . But Steven and Maureen Kass of Amityville , N.Y. , bring something new to the issue : they 're wrestling with the question five years after their divorce . The Kasses have five frozen embryos , made from his sperm and her eggs , left over from their married days of trying to conceive by in-vitro fertilization . Maureen , who is 40 and childless , wants to use them to have children . Steven , 38 , is adamant that he does n't want kids with his ex-wife . He is seeking to donate the embryos to research . Their fight has ended up in New York 's highest court , which hears arguments this week . Legal experts expect a landmark decision that will reverberate nationally on the hotly contested question of just who controls frozen fertilized tissue that has the potential to become human life . <P> From Internet privacy to genetic testing , technology has raced ahead too fast for legal doctrine to keep up . And nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges must rule on greater than in the realm of artificial reproduction . An estimated 80,000 to 100,000 frozen embryos  --  fertilized eggs no larger than a grain of sand  --  are being preserved in liquid-nitrogen canisters across the country . As many as 20,000 of them could be in legal limbo . As of now , the courts have no clear rules for resolving questions of ownership and control . Lawyers ca n't even agree on whether a frozen embryo should be regarded as a human life form , like a fetus , or an inanimate piece of property . <P> The desire to raise a family was one of the things that first brought the Kasses together . Steven , who runs an engineering company with his brother , met Maureen at a friend 's engagement party in 1986 . They began dating the following spring . They agreed they wanted children . But after their marriage , they had trouble conceiving . The couple spent five years and $75,000 at a Long Island fertility clinic ; Maureen was implanted with fertilized eggs at least nine times . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she felt that if we were not going to have kids , why stay with me ? " he says . <P> Both Maureen and Steven signed a clinic consent form directing that any unused embryos be donated for research . But a month before she sued Steven for divorce , Maureen told the hospital she did n't want the embryos destroyed . Her lawyer , Vincent Stempel , points out that she had surgery to create the embryos , while her ex-husband only donated sperm . " She went through a lot of physical pain to have these eggs extracted , " he says . And , he notes , they may represent her last chance of becoming a biological mother . <P> Here 's the catch : if Maureen succeeds in creating children , Steven will be financially responsible for them under New York law , even though he tried to stop them from being born . He argues that he should n't be forced to procreate with a woman whom he now disagrees with on nearly everything . " I do n't want my kids being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want them to have her input . " Just knowing that Maureen could one day turn their embryos into children has taken its toll on Steven . " Even dating is difficult , " he says . He usually waits until the third or fourth date , he says , before explaining , " I am divorced , but I have these frozen embryos hanging around .
