<p> " I made my life out of studying human behavior . I know what you 're going through right now , " he told them , throat tense , eyes smoldering . " You ca n't hide it . " <p> This was at once a passionate stump speech , a self-inflating celebrity ego trip and a sophisticated , almost spooky bit of mass hypnosis . <p> " You will never see another movie like this as long as you live , " he declared . " You will have these images in your head for the rest of your life . " <p> The movie is " American Me , " a brutal tale of the rise and fall of a Mexican-American gangster and , by the end , an earnest and bleak assessment of urban America 's culture of killing . <p> A roomful of government professionals , mainly Hispanic , had just watched it . Had just absorbed , in the last few minutes , the sight of brother garroting brother , and a man being stabbed 69 times , and a random drive-by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were watching Edward James Olmos , the director , co-producer and star of " American Me . " Watching , listening to him talk about what our society is on the brink of  --  " the most devastating four years in the history of mankind , " he told them . " The next four years will destroy the Republican Party . I feel it . " Bombings in our schools . " Uzis everywhere ! " He paused . " And we thought terrorists were coming from Libya . " <p> There he stood , hard handsome , his big black suit hanging sweet . Owning the room . <p> Though most famous for his role as the brooding Lt. Castillo on " Miami Vice , " Olmos has a reputation for artistic intensity , cultural integrity and community involvement reaching back 20 years . But in a downtown Washington screening room , and later in an uptown theater , he displayed something else . Something strange . <p> " I 'd like to make ' American Me ' an issue in the election this year , " Olmos said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He believes his movie could inspire " tremendous " public debate on gun control and education . To make his point , he recalled the 1988 film " Stand and Deliver , " in which he starred as Jaime Escalante , a real-life miracle-working calculus teacher in East Los Angeles . <p> " ' Stand and Deliver ' elected Bush ! " Olmos proclaimed . " When it came out , I asked Bush and Dukakis to see it . Bush saw it . " <p> Olmos then briefly reenacted a scene from the second debate between George Bush and Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis , when Dukakis was asked " Who are today 's American heroes ? " and sputtered some forgettable generalities , then Bush got the question and the first name out of his mouth was Jaime Escalante . ( Only Bush called him " Jamie , " which Olmos failed to remember . ) Olmos will tell you directly : " It became his call for education . That 's what won him his election . " <p> Even stranger was what the actor told a theater full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to those Latino critics , guardians of the group image , who would slam him for creating such a " negative role model " as the gangster Santana . <p> " No living Chicano has given more positive role models , " he said , " no one , not Anthony Quinn , not Ricardo Montalban , no one who has ever been a Latino on the face of the planet has ever given more positive role models , from ' Zoot Suit , ' ' Stand and Deliver , ' five years as Lt. Castillo . ... " <p> He was counting them out on his hand . <p> A Guy With a Mission The inescapable thought is : Wow , does Edward James Olmos have an overblown sense of himself or what ? <p> We consult filmmaker Robert M. Young , who has known Olmos since the mid ' 70s , when he gave the actor one of his first movie jobs , a small part in " El Alambrista , " and who is Olmos 's partner in the production company that developed " American Me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his closest friends . " <p> " Yeah , sometimes Eddie embarrasses me with some of the things he says , " Young says from his Los Angeles home . And the attitude predates his stardom . After Olmos auditioned for " El Alambrista , " Young recalls , " I had a kind of feeling , ' Is this guy a braggart ? ' " <p> But " one has to see Eddie in perspective , " he says . " He 's not selfish . You have to see Eddie on the set and in his personal life . There is no more modest person than Eddie . You go to a restaurant with Eddie , and Eddie 's talking to the busboys . " <p> As an artist , though , Olmos " really is a guy with a mission , " Young says . " He wants to tell stories that have truth in them and have a meaning to them . ... This is a guy who 's trying to stand up for a whole people . So for Eddie to preserve his vision , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " <p> Hey Mr. Coppola ... Face to face over tea and croissants , Olmos is quietly compelling . Pockmarked cheeks , ridged forehead , a jumble of lower teeth , his is a face to wonder over , to respect . It 's crowned with thick black hair just beginning to gray . <p> His eyes . In " Miami Vice , " they were weary and filled with mystique . In " Zoot Suit , " the 1981 filmed play in which he embodied the proud , flashy " pachuco " spirit of the ' 40s , they could become cold slits . In " Stand and Deliver , " the eyes were warm and whimsical . Here and now , they 're as guarded as a cat 's . <p> But words and opinions flow generously from the 45-year-old star . Expositions on youth gangs , the " demise of the family structure " and how the woman  --  or at least " the feminine side of the thought pattern "  --  is our only hope . Recollections of the days on " Miami Vice " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And an attack on Hollywood 's myth of the romantic gangster . <p> The original " American Me " script was written in the early ' 70s by Floyd Mutrux , based on the actual history of the " Mexican Mafia , " a gang that sprang up in the California penal system . Mutrux conceived of the gang leader Santana as a " heroic character , " Olmos says , someone to root for even when the retribution comes . <p> " I rewrote it and completely changed that , " he says . " I could n't have made that . Here in this movie , you do n't feel him as a heroic figure at all . And you should never . These guys should never be . " <p> It 's surprisingly anti-mythic the way Olmos plays Santana as clumsy and clueless in his encounters with the first woman he ever comes to love , having grown up locked down and knowing sex only as plunder . Before the gangster 's spiritual redemption , his girlfriend , whose son has died of an overdose , dismisses Santana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blight on his people . There is no glamour in him . <p> Olmos brings up Francis Ford Coppola 's classic , " The Godfather . " " Michael Corleone , to me , is a romantic hero , " he says . " I can see people actually wanting to live with the Corleone family . I do n't see anybody wanting to live with Santana 's family . " <p> Olmos went further when he addressed those youngsters in the theater . " When I saw ' The Godfather , ' I felt like being in the Corleone family , " he said , smiling , mock-preening . He speculated about a " Godfather 4 " with Andy Garcia as the new don , and Latino kids all over the country saying " That 's cool , " and then he turned stone-cold serious and jabbed a finger at the crowd : " That 's when you should stand up to Coppola and say , ' Eat expletive and die ! ' And you should ask Andy , ' Why did you do it , Andy ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corleone family ? ' " <p> He 's not just woofing . Olmos turned down a part in Brian De Palma 's " Scarface , " a movie famous for its gratuitous bloodletting , a movie now cited by young criminals as a favorite , 10 years after it was made . " Any part I wanted , other than the Al Pacino part and the Steve Bauer part . Anything . They offered me hundreds of thousands of dollars , " Olmos says casually , chewing food . " I 'm not a rich man . I ended up telling them ' Thank you but no thank you . ' I just could n't find myself inside that movie . " <p> Last year , while Olmos was making " American Me " for Universal , Taylor Hackford was shooting " Blood In , Blood Out , " about Latino youth gangs , for Disney . " That 's going to be an interesting one to watch , " Olmos says . <p> Hackford had offered him the project a few years ago  --  Olmos would direct , Hackford would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would direct that movie is if I had creative control . Final cut . He would n't give it to me . I said , ' That 's fine . I do n't want anything to do with it . ' I would n't touch that subject matter without having creative control . Ever . It 's too delicate . " <p> Now Olmos wonders about Hackford 's motives for doing " Blood In , Blood Out . " " I do n't know where he 's coming from , " he says . " All I do know is that at one time I heard from another actor who said Hackford 's intent for making the movie was to show the East Coast that the West Coast had gangsters also , and he was tired of all the gangster movies coming out of the East Coast . " <p> Pause . <p> " I think your intent comes out in your content every time , " he says . " I do n't think there 's any way of hiding it . And as soon as you see it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made the film . Why do you think he made that film ? Why 'd they make ' Scarface ' ? " <p> Umm , to make money ? <p> " Sure . Sure . Yeah . How much responsibility were they taking when they made that film ? Or did they care about the images they were projecting ? About the impact on people who 'd see it ? How much did they think about it in ' Terminator ' 1 or 2 ? " He peels another piece off his croissant , eats . " It 's interesting , is n't it ? " <p> ( A Disney publicist says Hackford is still working on " Blood In , Blood Out " and wo n't take press calls . The movie is due out this fall . ) <p> Olmos does say he admires the work of new-generation black filmmakers , such as John Singleton 's L.A. story " Boyz N the Hood . " " Those are anti-violent movies , " he says . " I think the filmmakers are very conscious of the responsibility of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-ethnic films . They 're much more aware . ... I pray that films like ' Boyz N the Hood ' and ' American Me ' capture the heart and spirit of the youth . I really hope they do . " <p> The Critics " I thought that Mr. Olmos brought it home . We can not hide from the truth , " said Christinia Mendoza , executive assistant to Rep. Edward Roybal ( D-Calif. ) , after the downtown screening . " Maybe the film will scare some sense into young criminals . " <p> " American Me " is n't a message movie , Olmos insists . But he speaks proudly of Father Gregory Boyle , a Jesuit priest in East L.A. who works with gangs and who called the movie , according to Olmos , " an exceptional piece of work . " <p> That 's true  --  in part . Boyle , pastor of the Dolores Mission Roman Catholic Church , does call it " a powerful movie . " He has seen it twice , once at a special screening for juvenile offenders , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You know , it really made you think " and " I want my little brothers to see this . " <p> But " as a strategy , it 's questionable , " Boyle says . " It 's sort of the ' Scared Straight ' approach . And you 're not going to scare a kid who does n't care whether he lives or dies . <p> " The largest problem out here is despair . If you present a picture that is so hopeless to kids who do n't have any sort of a way out , that to me equals more despondency . " <p> Boyle would have preferred a broader political analysis of urban poverty . " The most despondent gang-banging kid is transformed by a job , " he says . " Not by having the crap scared out of him . " <p> His Triangle Theory , Etc . Although Olmos now lives in the San Fernando Valley , he was born and raised in East Los Angeles and still " has a strong root to the East Side . My parents still live there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since 1972 , the actor has been speaking at high schools . " I 'm talking all races , colors and creeds . " And he has done a lot of thinking . And he 's about to do a lot of talking . <p> " As I 've watched the passage of time through the children , you see the changes in the attitudes , " he says . " Before , you would find six kids in a class who were showing signs of anger and dysfunctioning units back home ... ' acting out . ' Now , I just came from a school in Chicago where one gang member was found stuffed in a trash bin . He was dead . In school . <p> " I do n't know if that 's hit here yet , but if it has n't , you 're fortunate , " he says . " Because it 's going to hit the schools . That 's inevitable . You 'll see them taking each other down right there . Around the corner , bam . Imagine that one . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangle with his fingers . A triangle  --  " the strongest shape known to man . " One side is society  --  institutions like government , school , church  --  and another side is the family , and the third side is the individual . If either the social institutions or the family breaks down  --  this is the theory he 's got  --  you 've still got a base that can sustain the individual , though a fragile base . But if both sides break down ... <p> " ... and the father becomes unemployed and ca n't talk about it and feels less than a man , and the mother is alone and trying to work but she ca n't hold it up and winds up on state aid , that leaves the individual by himself . And you 're going to have a dysfunctional child . " And that 's the thing . <p> " How many thousands , hundreds of thousands of people have been rendered dysfunctional by lack of work ? Just in the last two years . So you know the problem we 're faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't feel for another maybe five or six or seven years . Like a kid right now who 'll be 12 , 13 , 14 in five years , who knows what 's going to happen ? I 'm telling you , you ai n't seen nothing yet . Because that child is out there on his own . <p> " The only hope we have  --  you know what it is ?  --  is the woman , " Olmos says . " In our film we show it , and in society as a whole . The woman can maybe keep the dialogue between the child and herself going . " <p> His parents divorced when he was 7 , so Olmos describes himself as a product of a " dysfunctional " family . But if he came into the house talking fresh , showing some attitude he 'd picked up on the streets , " she 'd slap me right upside the head and say , ' Excuse me ? Say that again . ' And it 's that strength of woman that is the last hope of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society as a whole . <p> " I 'm not saying all women . I 'm just saying the actual aesthetic of woman , of being female . The feminine side of the thought pattern , " he says . " If we had an equal balance , if women were equal with males , where their voice was as relevant as the male voice in our society as a whole , we would n't be in the mess we 're in . Social issues would be taken care of . The child , the humanity , would be taken care of . " <p> Olmos was divorced from Kaija Keel , daughter of musical-comedy star Howard Keel , two years ago . " We were really young when we started  --  she was 17 and I was 20  --  so we 've grown an awful lot , " he says . " We still relate well , and we have n't broken the ties with the children . " His sons  --  Mico , 20 , and Bodie , 17  --  served as production assistants on " American Me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a long conversation does Olmos start loosening up . Smiling even . The subject is " Miami Vice . " <p> Olmos , who had been nominated for a Tony Award for " Zoot Suit , " turned down a regular role on " Hill Street Blues " after appearing in a few early episodes . Not that he did n't like the show , but he had insisted on a " nonexclusive " contract . He wanted to be free to do other projects . And with the standard TV contract , the series owns an actor for five years ( with an option for two more ) . He might n't have been able , for example , to star in " The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez , " the critically acclaimed story of a legendary Mexican desperado , for " American Playhouse " in 1982 . ( Robert M. Young directed it . ) <p> " I 've seen many people lose their stride , their pace , their understanding of their own sense of value , by getting caught up in the television machinery and signing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So when he was courted in 1984 for " Miami Vice , " Olmos held out until he got a nonexclusive contract . Which came in handy when he wanted to make " Stand and Deliver . " <p> It 's been reported that , when he had a bit part on " Kojak " years ago , Olmos refused to deliver a line because " a Puerto Rican bartender would n't speak to a cop . " Still , it comes as a bizarre revelation that he used to write himself out of " Miami Vice " scenes . <p> " The last couple of years , my character , because of its mystique , had grown in popularity , " he explains . " People really caught on to him , and they would look for him . So the producers tried to use me more . All of a sudden you see the lieutenant every single time somebody does something . They wanted me to be in the shoot-'em-up-bang-bangs . But I 'd say , ' Castillo would n't be here . He 'd be back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow tape is up and I 'll go , ' What happened ? ' <p> " So I 'd say , ' I 'm not in this scene today . ' And they 'd go , ' But you 've got lines ! ' I 'd say , ' Yeah , well you do n't need ' em . ' ... And it shocked them . <p> " I said , ' Uh-uh . I know what you 're trying to do . You 're trying to sell more soap . It has nothing to do with story , it has everything to do with selling and marketing , and I 'm not going to put myself through that . You 'll actually defeat your own purpose . You 'll destroy what we have by using me this way . ' Because they would have used me up . <p> " Oh , they were fit to be tied  --  ' Eddie does n't want to work today . ' ' I did n't say that . I would love to work . Write the scripts so that I find my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , strong words . I mean , we really had some great moments of debate . " <p> He 's actually laughing .
