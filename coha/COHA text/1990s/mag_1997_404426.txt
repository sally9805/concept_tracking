It was hard enough learning the rules when we were pimply teenagers . But for the thousands of Canadian adults who become single parents every year , the dating game may be more difficult than ever . The seemingly simple act of becoming intimate with another grownup can be a real source of stress and anxiety when you have kids . C.K. , ( f. * ) a 41-year-old freelance writer in Toronto , recalls how her sons , then aged four and five , actually " threw mud balls " when a man came to pick her up for a date ! " I had been in a nasty custody fight , " she says , " so to my young sons , it was simply one more strange adult  --  maybe another lawyer or social worker  --  who did n't belong here . " While flying balls of mud are hardly typical , the response to more or dad dating does range from wariness to fear to actual joy , depending strongly upon everything from the child 's age to how the single parent handles the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of Edmonton , 49 , a former military man who had custody of his children for a short while when they were only one , four and six years old : " I had no problem whatsoever with my kids and dating . They were young and unthreatened by it all . " The key word in Doug 's statement is , of course , " young , " since he makes the ( debatable ) assumption that young children are less threatened by parental dating . Art T. , 49 , who works for a gas company in Montreal , has grown kids now , but has discovered a mixed response from his partner Yvonne K. 's four children from her two past marriages  --  two are in their mid-teens , but two are six and five . " Yvonne 's younger kids were happy with me , " he declares , " but the older ones felt that I was an intruder when we began dating . " Yvonne , 47 , who works for a customs broker , had to broker far more than she expected when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones first met Art , my five-year-old son looked up at him and squealed , " Please sleep over tonight ! " I almost froze ! I asked him why , and he told me , " I like him . He 's a boy and so am I ! " Yvonne laughs out loud at the memory , because she quickly realized the reason for such a shocking declaration : " My youngest is sick and tired of being the only male in the house , with three sisters and me . Even our cat is female . " Of course , Art 's face turned beet-red at the child 's eager request , especially when the lad kept begging , over and over , " Why not sleep over ? " " I explained to him , " Maybe later ! ' ' " says Yvonne . In contrast , her two teens , watching their mother 's relationship with Art grow over the following several months , once sat morn down and lectured , " We both think you should wait before you two sleep together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " if a couple broke up when a child is pre-verbal , with little knowledge of them as a couple , it is always far easier to introduce a new person . " But the age of the child of the about-to-date-again single parent is only one of many factors : Who is the custodial parent ? How does your child adapt to change ? And what about gender ? If a girl " rarely sees her biological father , she may over-connect with her mother 's new date , " says Leventhal . " Whereas many a boy may be very protective , and not accept this new man around , since he is used to being " the head of the house . ' ' " As for early adolescence : " That 's especially difficult , because girls can get jealous , and see a new woman around as a rival , who is taking away the time she needs to spend with dad . You can see how important it is for parents to be aware of how children think at each stage in their lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for everyone involved  --  is that it 's never just two people on that date . Lynn L. , 25 , a Montreal sales clerk with a four-year-old daughter , makes herself clear : " If they do n't like my daughter , I do n't make a relationship out of it . I watch how they interact and feel toward her . And I tend to include her , because we 're a package deal ! " M.S. , 46 , a Toronto dentist , was left a widower over a decade ago with two children under the age of four , yet his words echo Lynn 's precisely : " We come as a package deal , so my children 's reaction to anyone I date has to have an effect on me . If it 's not a favourable response , the kids would come first . " Of course , even if the relationship is a good one all around , there 's always that sense of caution . " I explain to the kids that I like this woman , but I do n't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes up ! You see , my 11-year-old daughter would just love to have a mother figure around . " R.B. , 44 , a music teacher in Toronto , was widowed in her mid-thirties , with three children under the age of 11 to care for . " They 've accepted the fact that I have my own life , and I 've made that clear to them : " I am always there for you , but I also have my own life . ' I did n't want them to feel that they 've got to stay at home with their poor mom ! " And , like most other single parents , R.B. was determined not to put her kids " on a roller coaster of expectations . " So , when she started to date , she did n't let her children see the man " until it looked more serious . I did n't want them to build up their fantasies : " Look who Mom 's going out with ! ' ' " Judy S. of Toronto , a 40-year-old writer and teacher , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were six and two when she separated : " I try not to involve the kids until I see a man a lot . " She sees it as an " advantage " that her sons have a strong bond with their biological father , so " they are not passionately looking for a father figure in the men I date . " Then , of course , there is the additional problem of Sex and the Single Parent : When to , how to , and  --  possibly the most important  --  where to . Liliane Spector , a psychologist who works with couples and families at Jewish General Hospital in Montreal , is adamant : " A phenomenon to be avoided is a new person in mom 's or dad 's bed . Until one is more serious in a relationship , one should not expose children to adults staying overnight . Have outings ! Invite him or her over for supper , so the new partner becomes more visible . And there are often times when the children are over at the other parent 's , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this article are any indication , many single dads do seem to be sensitive to the problems inherent in sleepovers . S.L. , 32 , a photographer who lives in rural Ontario , has agreed with his lover that if she stays over , she sleeps in his six-year-old sons bed , while the boy sleeps in dad 's . " I 've made the decision that it 's better to not have him see me sleep with someone else . It 's less complicated for him if she sleeps in his bed . For me , there is a real distinction between my role as dad , and my role as adult/lover/partner  --  but sometimes they 're hard to separate . " Ralph P. , a retired GM supervisor in Oshawa , Ont. , has grown kids now , but he remembers when his daughters were ten and 12 at the time of the divorce . " When you have a loss , there must be a time for healing . I had to do it discreetly , so we 'd wait for bad weather . " How 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a woman sleep over , so we 'd wait for bad weather . Then , when they 'd wake up and see her on the couch , I 'd be able to explain to them , " Look at this bad weather ! She had to sleep over ! ' Then , she can meet the kids . It 's better than sneaking in and being caught in bed . It may be fun and games for you , but not for the kids , when they find out the wrong way ! " How about single women and the sleepover question ? J.M. of Montreal , a 42-year-old medical secretary , just got remarried , but she separated a decade ago when the kids were only four and seven . She had the good fortune of her children meeting and liking her future date/lover ( and now new husband ) at the meetings of the One-Parent Family Association , and they were magically " drawn together . " Still , even though her kids knew and liked both her " friend " and his child , " both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over  --  with his son  --  they slept in the living room . If you set morals for kids , you should live them ! " ( Not that it always comes easy . While her children call their new stepfather " Dad "  --  to the shock and delight of them both  --  the son of J.M. 's new husband , whom he had raised from infancy , suddenly began to misbehave at school after Dad remarried , and even moved out  --  to live with his biological mother . " My new husband is torn apart , " she bemoans today . ) D.W. , 40 , a fisheries consultant in Halifax with two children under five , was adamant about sleepovers , for both her ex and herself . " The rule was , no sleepovers when the kids are over  --  but he broke that quickly . " she complains . " But there is no way that I will add that to their problems . If my kids came into my bedroom in the middle of the night and found a man , they 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids do n't understand the dynamic . " Yet , she admits sadly , " I 'm starved to have another adult around the house , because my whole life is with the kids . " ( Such loneliness is sadly common ; not every single parent can find the time , or effort it takes , to seek out someone to date . ) Yet out in Victoria , B.C. , 33-year-old J.M. , who works in a physiotherapy clinic , chose not to prepare her two girls , eight and nine , for her new man 's sleepover . " The older one expressed feeling ignored , left out  --  " You like him more than me ! ' ' " she admits , yet she made no formal announcement before the intimate visits began . " They woke up one morning , and we were in bed together . And it was fine  --  far better than I expected . " For many single parents on the dating scene , sleepovers do n't seem to be the biggest problem ; it 's the very act of dating itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My two sons ( seven and nine ) were so pleased that I was dating their basketball coach , " says S.N. , 42 , an insurance manager in Toronto , " they told me , " You 'd be well-suited , Mom ! ' ' " Yet her lover 's son , also nine , " feels threatened that I 'll take his dad away . " Perhaps the most troubling tale comes from Kathy C. , 41 , a mother of five in Mississauga , Ont. : When she had dated a man for about six months , all her children declared , " Paul is here all the time-have him move in ! " So Paul did move in , and " most of the kids even asked him to adopt them . " But her oldest son soon realized that he was no longer " the man of the house , " and he began to fervently protest until Paul moved out . " I 'm leaving the house , but not your mother ! " he told them as he left . Kathy still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the answers to the single parent 's dating dilemmas ? At times , the kids seem to have them all : R.A. , 39 , who works in a Montreal hospital , notes that " sometimes my son , now 14 , sees things I have n't seen about my date : " He eats like a cow chewing hay ! ' Or he 'll keep saying , " This guy is a nerd , Mom ? " Yet no matter how funny that is  --  and , yes , R.A. dumped that guy pretty quickly  --  it 's the parent who must ultimately make such important decisions . " Dating is part of adult life , and must remain that way " insists psychologist Spector . " It 's not up to the children to decide who is right for their parents . " But it is up to the whole family to communicate . With a healthy parent-child relationship , those bad vibes with morn or dad 's new " friend " can often be worked out .
