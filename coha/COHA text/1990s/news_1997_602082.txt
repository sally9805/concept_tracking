<p> Lisa had problems . She was unemployed and hard up for money . She had bad luck with men , always looking for love in the wrong places . She never got over her parents ' divorce , had spent time in drug rehab and was obese . <p> But to an international drug-smuggling syndicate , Lisa was just right . She was the perfect " mule , " or drug carrier . She was desperate and attention-starved . They told her nothing . She asked no questions . <p> Now , she 's one of 1,550 Americans spending another day behind bars in a foreign country . Most are alone and deeply depressed . They rarely see family or even a lawyer . Life is harsh and drones on endlessly . The State Department , in an understatement , calls imprisonment abroad " the hassle of your life . " <p> For Lisa , it started with her arrest in Thailand . Then 27 , she was busted at Bangkok 's Don Muang International Airport as she boarded a flight to Athens with more than 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now 32 , she is in the fifth year of a 40-year sentence for drug smuggling at the Womens Remand Home on the outskirts of the steamy Thai capital . She must serve eight years before becoming eligible for transfer to a U.S. prison . <p> " She 's guilty , yes , but talk about the end of the food chain , " says her anguished father in Chicago , who asked that neither he nor his daughter be named for fear of hurting Lisa 's chances of a transfer home . " Several women like Lisa ( are ) in jail there . They were all desperate . They were just taken advantage of . " <p> Who are they ? <p> Like Lisa , one-third of the Americans arrested overseas are busted on drug charges . Many are young , either former college students or , like Lisa , young adults struggling to find their way in life . Almost none are big-time drug traffickers . <p> According to State Department records supplied to USA TODAY , about 6,000 Americans are arrested around the world each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American citizens are in prison in about 90 countries at any given time . <p> " It 's a big problem that 's here to stay , " says Richard Atkins , chief lawyer at the Philadelphia-based International Legal Defense Counsel , which works on behalf of Americans imprisoned abroad . " My guess would be that even more people are arrested than the numbers show . Some people are able to buy themselves out of it in the early stages , before it 's even reported . " <p> Foreign arrest has become so routine that about 300 consular officers around the world spend thousands of hours a year working on just these cases . Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kingston , Jamaica , for example , spent 103 hours visiting imprisoned Americans in their area last year . But in an era of downsized diplomacy , U.S. embassies increasingly have limited resources . As millions of Americans travel and take up residence overseas , responding to the problems of overseas arrests is becoming a challenge . <p> Lawyers working with such cases say harsh prison conditions and lengthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the pressure . Families have lost their savings trying to win freedom for their relatives . <p> Sentencing and prison terms vary widely . In Malaysia , Pakistan , Saudi Arabia , Thailand and Turkey , an American can get the death penalty for drug trafficking . <p> Minor infractions that might result in a reduced sentence in the USA , such as marijuana possession , could put an American in prison overseas for many years . U.S. laws do not apply . Dual nationality often is ignored by host governments . And Americans often are refused bail because of fears they might flee the country . <p> Most Americans arrested abroad use public defenders , many of whom speak no English . Families often can not afford to retain expensive international lawyers . Even if families can , many countries stipulate that an American must be represented by a local lawyer . Only in extraordinary cases can consular staff help an American understand what is being said in court , with mixed results . <p> " A lot of stuff would go on in the courtroom , " recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was chronicled in the film Midnight Express . ( See story below . ) " Then they 'd put the chains back on you , drag you into the hall and explain what had been happening for the last half-hour . " <p> The crimes <p> The crimes landing Americans in overseas prisons also vary : <p>  --  One Texan , who does not want U.S. officials to use his name , is serving a 51/2-year sentence in Mexico City for importing 50 bullets . <p> " Texas and Arizona have a gun culture , " says Richard Gonzales , the U.S. consul in Mexico City . " People carry shotguns in the back of their pickups . We 're getting a lot of cases of Farmer John from south Texas going to buy a case of beer in Mexico with six shotgun shells in the back of his truck he 's forgotten , " he says . Mexico " is taking these cases much more seriously now . " <p>  --  Joseph Morris Jr. , 38 , of Louisiana is being held in an Iranian prison for entering the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The State Department says it has been " aware " of Morris ' detention only since late March . <p> Morris , a devout Muslim who also goes by the name Youssef , was attempting to cross Iran on his way to Saudi Arabia for the Muslim pilgrimage haj when he was arrested . <p> Because the United States has no diplomatic relations with Iran , Morris has been visited by Swiss officials who handle U.S. affairs there . <p>  --  Stephen Roye , 51 , an Emmy-award-winning Los Angeles movie producer , is serving a 40-year sentence , commuted from death , after being arrested in 1994 at Bangkok airport with more than 7 pounds of heroin in his luggage . <p> Roye , a free-lance journalist at the time of his arrest , says he was researching a story on the Thai drug trade when he was arrested . Roye 's father says his son was set up by the syndicate he was attempting to infiltrate for a magazine story . <p> He says Roye is cracking under the strain of life in a Thai prison . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God lately . I do n't expect my son to live through this . " <p>  --  Lori Berenson , 27 , a former student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , is serving a life sentence in Peru for association with the Marxist Tupac Amaru rebels , who took over the Japanese ambassador 's resdence in Lima last year . The rebels seized hundreds of hostages . <p> The Berensons and the U.S. Embassy in Lima have strenuously protested her trial by a military tribunal , a court that U.S. officials say failed to meet basic international standards . But nothing has budged Peruvian authorities . Many Peruvians believe Berenson is guilty of charges that she helped the rebels stockpile weapons . Her parents fear she may die in a freezing mountaintop prison . <p> For Chicagoan Lisa , prison life in Thailand could not get much worse . At night , she sleeps on the floor with about 70 other women in a hot dormitory . The women sleep on their sides , packed together like sardines . During the day , there 's no recreation time , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Thais want the prison experience to be such that the poorest Thai person will never want to go back , " attorney Atkins says . " For women it 's especially bad . There are no sanitary napkins , for instance . And since they sleep on their sides right up against the next person , they just bleed all over the person next to them . <p> " Food is pet-grade rice with boll weevils and vermin in it , " Atkins says . " Not everyone can make the eight years before being eligible for a transfer home . <p> " They come out mentally and physically damaged . " <p> In Peru , like Thailand , prison conditions are soul-destroying  --  bleak , frigid and Spartan . Lori Berenson is reported to be suffering several ailments because of poor nutrition , the high altitude and extreme cold at the Andean prison . <p> In Germany , on the other hand , prisons are considered far better than in the USA . Prisoners there earn vacation points that can be used for stints on the outside . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German-U.S. prisoner exchange program . American prisoners in Germany , U.S. officials say , have even likened it to a Club Med holiday . <p> And in Mexico , if you have money , prison life is n't half bad . Conjugal visits are routinely allowed , and you can bring a TV , a VCR and other amenities into your cell . <p> Mexico gets the most American visitors of any country , so it is n't surprising that it has the most Americans getting in trouble . In 1995 , 33% of reported arrests of Americans abroad were in Mexico . <p> U.S. officials have tried to spread the word that being in prison overseas is no fun and that U.S. authorities abroad ca n't do much to help . Hollywood also has helped depict the grim reality of imprisonment abroad with films like Midnight Express and Dark Holiday , a made-for-TV movie about an American woman imprisoned in Turkey on charges that she tried to smuggle antiquities out of the country . <p> U.S. officials abroad can provide a list of local lawyers , visit jailed Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discriminated against . And they can contact family members . But that 's about it . They can not intervene in a foreign country 's legal system . <p> " American citizens traveling abroad need to respect the laws and culture of the foreign country they are in , " Atkins says . " Because once they 're jailed , there 's very little that can be done . " <p> Family burden <p> The burden of Americans in jail abroad falls most heavily on their families . Atkins says desperate families often fall prey to unscrupulous operators promising they can bring their loved ones home . <p> " People spend huge amounts of money on lawyers , military types and mercenaries who say they have high-level contacts with the governments concerned and can get their family members out of jail , " Atkins says . " But it never works . " <p> Stephen Roye 's father , Leo , spent more than $ 100,000 trying to get his son released from prison in Thailand . He eventually went broke . His son still languishes in a cell . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leo Roye says . " There 's nothing more I can do . " <p> Lori Berenson 's parents have held protests and news conferences in the USA , written to several congressmen and traveled to Peru many times . But nothing has changed . <p> " You place your bets and take your chances , " says David Kurakane , a U.S. official in Lima . " These kids should be enjoying the prime of their lives , not doing hard time in these jails . "
