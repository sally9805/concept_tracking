It 's obvious from the empties and the crusted grill when I get to Allan Bard house in Bishop , California , on the east side of the Sierra Nevada , that I 've come after the party . And it 's obvious from the sleeping bags , tents , and backcountry ski boots drying in the mid-May sun , after the trip as well . He 's just finished guiding a group from Paiute Pass to Rock Creek . It was a bit of a busman 's holiday on a classic Sierra route . The " clients . " now milling ; in the sun and packing their cars to leave are a bunch of old friends from the ski industry , along with a couple of apprentice guides who 've been training with Bardini , as he 's universally known . I 've skied that trip with him , as well as several others on the Sierra Crest . And I 've learned this about skiing in the backcountry with him : He 'll reward you with the best snow that can be found ; subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and general badinage ( Bardinage ? ) ; improve your skiing in some way ; and markedly increase your chances for staying alive . The last item was evidently a concern of this group as well . They tell me about the final day of the trip , when avalanche paths above Pine Creek had to be traversed . Some 40-degrees steep and 3,000 feet high , the paths were shaded just enough to firm them up . " Oh man , " one of the skiers says to me , " you blow it , and you 're down Pine Creek and showing up for work at the mine in seconds . " For one of America 's best ski guides , keeping such calamities in check is ' part of the job . Bard tells me he traversed out first ( " Hell , I was freaked , " he admits ) , shucked his skis , pulled 200 feet of climbing rope and an ice ax from his pack , and kicked steps back across . Stopping midway above the traverse line , he set up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skier . It 's the stuff of great tales . But I 'm here for fewer heroics and for a roof , not a tent , over my head : I 've come to relax and to do some day-tripping with an old pal . Bard 's 43 . I 've got a few years on him and , the week before coming , had beaten myself up skiing steep , avalanche-prone chutes in Quebec 's ChicChoc Mountains , stopping home in northern Vermont just long enough to pick up plane tickets and learn that I have access to a Jeep Grand Cherokee at Reno Airport . From there , I 'll drive to Bishop , which is about 30 miles south of Mammoth . Such a 4X4 approach vehicle means that Bard and I can day-trip , pushing the Jeep as close to the snow line as possible to avoid onerous hiking with our skis strapped to our packs . In the early 80s , when we both taught cross-country skiing in Vermont , we would have called it ski touring . But now the chic term is backcountry skiing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport . People tend to think it 's only experts who ski on his trips , he says . Not so . " Most of the people who ski with me are intermediates . If you can sideslip , traverse , do a kick turn , and a good snowplow turn or a stem ... and have the sense to put your skis on before putting your pack on , you can ski with me , " he says . When Bard 's not guiding , he 's teaching Alpine and telemark skiing at Mammoth Mountain , and he 's fully certified in both . And like me , most of the time he skis parallel on tele equipment . In his case , maybe it 's because he 's usually skiing with a pack ( 40 pounds of repair and rescue gear , even for a day 's outing with friends ) and does n't need the strain of genuflecting . I know that I , too , have only so many deep knee bends in the bank , and I do n't want to overdraw the account . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French roast at a quarter to five in the morning . It can also mean , as we find out on our first day , after a long haul by car and on skins , that the snow 's unskiable . Our grogginess is dispelled by the drive among the boulders and outcrops of the Buttermilks , the knobby foothills below Basin Peak , where Bard thinks we can crank some good turns on a shoulder he calls Peaklet . The desert we cross is blooming in patches of violet , pink , and yellow . Far ahead , with the early morning light on it , the Sierra Crest is a wall of flame . The intermittent detonations we hear are sage grouse , Bard says . Compared with the " pa'tridge " in my woodlot , these guys sound like they 're beating on a steel drum . We continue to beat our way toward the McGee Creek drainage and Mount Humphreys . The dirt roads through this one-time grazing and mining land are suffering an identity crisis : byways or stream beds ? No matter , Bard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're saving ) . But soon after strapping on climbing skins and avalanche beacons , we find the segue through the sagebrush more satisfying than the skiing . Ahead of us is Basin Peak . Its long , steep snow tongue is a distinctive landmark seen from downtown Bishop . But we do n't get there . Even though it 's still early , Bard 's brown lab , Chocolate Moose , is sinking into a snowpack that has a ways to go  --  it needs more cycles of freezing overnight and thawing , before it becomes what Bard calls " mature corn . " No , we 'd be in for a muck-a-thon of turns in soupy slop and could expect soft-snow avalanches . So we strip off the skins and head back down . A day ( and colder night ) later , three skiers have joined us in the predawn darkness at Bard 's slightly ramshackle house . ( " Outside , a miner 's cabin ; inside , Bardini world headquarters . " ) Bruce Russell is a hot young Mammoth skier picking up free-heeling with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-round for an outfit out of Tahoe ; and Dave King is Bard 's neighbor . Today , Table Mountain is our destination : The change of venue means no need to push the Jeep . We climb up paved road in the Bishop Creek drainage and park at the mountain 's base . We 're hoping the Table will be set for five and that we 'll be eating corn . A winter of welding the monorail that will carry skiers from a parking lot to the Mammoth base lodge and lifts apparently has n't diminished neighbor King 's energy . He has preceded us . By the time we 've kicked steps up a steep gully , he 's attached skins and is blasting ahead higher up . Bard acknowledges King 's energy , but looking at his tracks , he mutters , " Stupid steps . " King 's traverse line on a 35-degree slope is too steeply angled , Bard thinks . Indeed , if the slope were any steeper , Bard would recommend kicking steps sans skis . " Skinning up steep slopes requires steep kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . " I can go a hell of a lot faster by making twice as many small steps as by making half as many big steps . It should be almost easier than walking up stairs . In a guiding context , you want to have people arrive at the top of the hill with a little gas left to enjoy the fun part . You ca n't do that by killing them off on the uphill . " We 've climbed 3,000 feet over big snowfields above timberline . Enough to justify a rest on top , some water , and a shared beer . The top-of-the-world view is incredible . Big peaks : Humphreys , Darwin , Emerson . But what strikes me is how much of it is accessible just in day tours : the Checkered Demon ; the Wahoo Gully on Mount Locke and the alternative back-side route we do when the gully 's too icy ; the 6,000 feet of the Elderberry Canyon , enfolded in the great sloping mass of Mount Tom . The sun is seductive , but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skins , stuffing them into our jackets to keep the adhesive warm and tacky in case we decide to climb again . Table is n't exactly presenting us with a corn-ucopia : We have n't had enough of a freeze-thaw cycle to produce the beluga-sized ball bearings that sling you through the fall line . But it 's still sweet . Exuberant , I drop into a low-rider telemark stance and crank off a string of quick-footed , thigh-burning turns . Russian dance , my regular Vermont ski partner calls it . We clear Table in great gulps of terrain .... Until the bottom falls out . The snow has gone from sun-softened to sun-rotted . From flan to polenta . Instead of rebounding , we 're sucked in to our knees : In the court of the mountains , motion has been , well , tabled . The best we can muster is gorilla skiing , desperately leaping and landing , sinking a mine shaft with each biff . Prospecting for even slightly firmer snow that will offer something of a platform , we spread out . Incredibly , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're seven . A short time later , Bard tells me that from his perspective above and behind us , he does n't like our " disorganization , " even though we 're just a couple hundred feet above the car . He just starts to impose order when , next to me , the gully lets go in a sudden slurry . An " ooze-alanche , " Bard calls it . But enough to bury someone who has fallen face-first in its path . All of us are backcountry veterans , and we know we 've been cautioned , but not caught . Back at the cars , tailgates come down , boots are removed , and longnecks cracked . It 's spring , with plenty of time left to paddle in the Owens River and take an obligatory soak in the thermal pools of Hot Ditch , south of town .
