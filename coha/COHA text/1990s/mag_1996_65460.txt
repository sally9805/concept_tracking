The driver turns the corner , kills the headlights and closes in on the first crack house of the evening . There are 14 law-enforcement officers and one big league baseball player in the back of the van , and as it approaches the address on the search warrant , their idle chatter stops . The cops tighten their helmet straps and grip their weapons . The player adjusts his bulletproof vest . " Thirty seconds out , " says the driver , a narcotics agent who is overseeing the operation . " Time to go to work . " // As the van tears up the driveway , its doors swing open . The cops spring out of the vehicle as if their seats were on fire and dash toward the house . A team of snipers carrying AR-15 assault rifles surrounds the small , run-down house . One officer totes a boomer , a tool designed to break open doors . Others are armed with M semiautomatic weapons and with handguns . Ryan Klesko , the 24-year-old left-fielder for the Atlanta Braves and an honorary deputy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last officer to exit the van and then follows closely behind , his cheek full of chewing tobacco and his eyes glowing with anticipation . Lots of people enjoy watching the TV show Cops . Klesko , who hit three home runs in the Braves ' World Series triumph over the Cleveland Indians last fall , prefers the real thing . // The Palm Beach County sheriff 's office is holding search warrants for four houses on this unseasonably cool Friday night in March , and this first house is the one from which the other three obtain their drugs . The raid begins with the report of a flash-bang , a small explosive device whose loud and frightening detonation announces the arrival of the Special Response Team , a SWAT-like elite unit of the sheriff 's department . // The flash-bang is tossed through an open door of the tiny house , and when it explodes , the house fills with smoke . Some of the occupants hit the floor and wait facedown to be handcuffed . One suspect , in an attempt to dispose of drugs , pushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house , slicing open his arm . The cops search for drugs and weapons quickly and efficiently , as if the operation were as routine as stopping a speeder . The ballplayer watches in awe , like a wide-eyed kid who has been invited to sit in the dugout at a World Series game . There are lots of things to do on Friday night in South Florida , but as far as Klesko is concerned , nothing beats busting bad guys . // " There 's no doubt in my mind that this is what I would be doing if I were n't playing ball , " he says . " I really have a lot of respect for these guys , because they risk their lives every day to keep scum off the streets and keep the cities safe . " Klesko , meanwhile , risks his life to watch . Hey , everyone needs a hobby . // When he signed with the Braves in 1989 , Klesko decided downhill skiing was too risky and gave it up . These days , his off-field activities include scuba diving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and surfing . He cuts back on the adventures when baseball season begins , but he still sneaks away for an occasional held trip . On a recent day off , he drove from the Braves ' spring training base in West Palm Beach to Orlando , where he and some friends spent $1,000 to rent Typhoon Lagoon , a water park at Disney World , for almost three hours of boogie-boarding and surfing. // " Who knows what 's going to happen tomorrow ? " says Klesko , who had a home run and four RBIs in Atlanta 's 10-8 Opening Day victory over the San Francisco Giants on Monday . " So if I get a chance to do something today , I do it . That 's the way I look at life . " // Last year the Braves ' World Series drive was only one of Klesko 's adventures . On the field he hit .310 with 23 homers and 70 RBIs in just 329 at bats , and he emerged as a star in the National League . Off the field he watched a stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went backstage after concerts by Van Halen and country singers Brooks &amp; Dunn , and he hosted the members of the rock group Boston in the Atlanta clubhouse. // While many of his teammates have gained reputations for taking a businesslike approach to the game , Klesko prefers to attack each day as if he were serving a warrant . He does n't watch MTV ; he lives it . Most of the Braves share a passion for golf , but Klesko generally can find more exciting ways to fill a day . // Klesko grew up in Westminster , Calif. , just outside Huntington Beach , but five years ago he settled in Boynton Beach , Fla. , 20 minutes south of the Braves ' spring home . He shares a waterfront house with his girlfriend , Michelle Penzenik , a dance instructor and a former Miss Palm Beach County . The surfing off Florida is n't nearly as challenging as it is off California , but Klesko has found plenty of other ways to get his kicks . // In 1990 , when Klesko was still a minor leaguer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garten , a local diving instructor and five-year veteran of the Palm Beach County sheriff 's office . Klesko and Garten hit it off instantly . In the off-season three years ago Garten invited Klesko to spend an evening with the Special Response Team , and Klesko has been an unofficial member ever since . For a man who never stops searching for his next adrenaline rush , finding the team was like catching the perfect wave . // Throughout the off-season and into spring training , Klesko goes along on drug raids whenever his schedule allows . Many times the officers find weapons during these raids . Occasionally they are greeted by attack dogs . " Young guys do exciting and interesting things , " says Braves general manager John Schuerholz . " If Ryan puts himself at risk , it 's entirely his risk . " // Klesko , who does n't bother to wear a mask to hide his identity on the raids , does n't feel he 's taking a great risk , although he probably would n't mind if he were . " I just enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They know exactly what they 're doing at all times . They study the house , and they take all kinds of precautions . They 've never had to shoot a suspect when I 've been along . A couple of dogs , maybe , but no people . " // The relationship has proved to be beneficial to both sides : Klesko has outfitted the Special Response Team in black Reebok shoes and Ray-Ban glasses . Charles McCutcheon , the sheriff of Palm Beach County , in turn presented Klesko with an honorary deputy 's badge earlier this year . Klesko is proud of the badge and is determined to replace it with the real thing . He plans to take the necessary exams to become a reserve officer in the sheriff 's department . " Then I 'll actually get paid for my work , " he says . // This baseball season , for the first time , Klesko 's name appears to be tattooed on the Braves ' lineup . He signed a one-year , $315,000 contract on March 1 ; he will most likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he arrived at Atlanta 's camp in February , six weeks of uncertainty lay ahead . Klesko had been considered a power-hitting phenom since high school , but these were still the Braves . Openings come more easily on the Supreme Court than in the Atlanta lineup . // " That 's the toughest thing about this organization : There are so many great players , " Klesko says . " Nothing is given to you . Bobby Cox has always been the kind of manager to break in the young guys slowly . I had a hard time dealing with it for a while ; I 'd be down in the minors complaining and griping . I 'd be hitting .290 with 16 home runs and wondering , When do I get to play in the big leagues ? After a while , I was waiting for a trade . " // Klesko caught a break a couple of years ago when another thrill-seeking Atlanta outfielder took his off-season adventures too far . Ron Gant , an All-Star leftfielder for the Braves in 1992 , broke his leg in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity for Klesko at least to platoon in leftfield . He batted .278 with 17 homers in 245 at bats and finished third in the National League Rookie of the Year voting . " If Gant did n't get hurt , " he says , " there probably still would n't be a spot for me. " // Last season Klesko proved that he was more than just a part-time player . He hit .331 from June 6 until the end of the regular season and wound up with a .608 slugging percentage , which would have placed him second in the National League if he had gotten enough plate appearances . Then he took his place on the World Series stage . At Cleveland 's Jacobs Field , after the Braves won the first two games at home against the Indians , Klesko became the first player ever to hit home runs in three straight Series road games . // His performance fueled rumors that Atlanta would not re-sign veteran first baseman Fred McGriff , who became a free agent at the end of the season . Considering that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minors , and considering that he 's still awkward in the outfield , it seemed a natural move . But in December the Braves signed McGriff to a four-year , $20.5 million contract and dispatched Klesko to leftfield , where he will have to get comfortable for the prime of his career . Deputy Klesko insists he is glad that Crime Dog McGriff is staying in Atlanta , even though it means Klesko must put away his first baseman 's mitt . " I honestly felt like we needed McGriff back , " says Klesko . " He 's a good friend and a good presence in our clubhouse . " As for his own presence in the outfield , Klesko says , " I think I played well in left last year , especially in the second half . I do n't care if they tell me to catch ; I 'm glad to be in the majors and playing for the world champions . " // Of the three home runs Klesko hit in Cleveland , he has no trouble selecting the most memorable : It was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to see her son play in person much anymore . She has had a number of health problems since she accidentally inhaled hazardous chemicals while on her job packing aerospace parts four years ago . She has trouble breathing and is often forced to stay in her house , close to the air conditioner or humidifier. // " If she gets a cold , it 's like being deathly ill , " says Ryan . " Sometimes I call her up , and she can barely talk . " // Still , Lorene made it to Cleveland to see Ryan crank one into the right-center-field seats in Game 4 . The ball landed a few rows in front of her , and she introduced herself to the man who caught it . In a sign of these memorabilia-crazed times , the man asked Lorene for a photo ID , and then he offered her a deal : She could have the ball in exchange for two balls autographed by the entire Braves team , a few pictures and a bat . Lorene considered it a bargain . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was sitting there with Michelle , and I said , ' Come on , Ryan , hit one to Mom . ' Next thing I know , the ball is landing 10 feet in front of me . It was just incredible . " // For Ryan it was the highlight of his career . His mother , he says , is the reason he made it to the big leagues . His father , Howard , and Lorene were divorced when Ryan was in high school , and before that , Howard was frequently away at work in the oil fields off Long Beach , Calif . It was Lorene who caught for Ryan in the backyard , sitting on a flipped-over water bucket to give him a good target . // " I did the same thing for his two sisters , who were pretty good softball players , " says Lorene . " It was no big deal . " At least not until young Ryan learned the deuce . Lorene had no trouble with his fastball , but one day she took a nasty curve-ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ryan 's dream was to play in the big leagues , " Lorene says , " and I just did what every mother would do : I helped him follow his dream . " // Ryan says he tried for years to pay his mother back with a new car , but she resisted . Finally he just walked into her house and put the keys to a Ford Thunderbird on the kitchen table . // " When I was a kid , my mom would watch baseball on TV and say to me , ' See those guys ? You 're going to be one of them someday , ' " Ryan says . " I never thought it was possible , but she always believed in me. " // Lorene was in Atlanta in October to share her son 's World Series triumph . " The morning after the last game , we were sitting around just enjoying the whole thing , " says Lorene , " and Ryan said to me , ' Well , Mom , we won the World Series . What next ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done just about everything I wanted to do in life . What am I going to do now ? ' " // He 'll think of something .
