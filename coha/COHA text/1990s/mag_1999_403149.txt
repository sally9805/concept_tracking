THE RICH ARE DIFFERENT // AT 86 , THE MASTER INVESTOR STILL DISPLAYS THE TRAITS THAT HAVE MADE HIM A STOCK-PICKING LEGEND . DAPPERLY ATTIRED INT a pale yellow sports jacket , Sir John Templeton is guiding me through his colonial-style house in the Bahamas . Here , in a secondfloor study , he points with quiet satisfaction to a portrait of himself at Buckingham Palace on the day the queen of England awarded him a knighthood . He pauses for a moment , contemplating his extraordinary success . " It 's like winning a game , " he confides . " This year I received my 22nd honorary doctorate , and that did give me some feeling that maybe I was not too foolish . " A short , lean man with courtly manners and a soft Tennessee drawl , Templeton is certainly no fool . Indeed , he 's arguably the greatest global stock picker of the century . A pioneer of foreign investing , he founded the Templeton Growth Fund in 1954 and proceeded to rack up unsurpassed returns of 15% annually for 38 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocketing some $400 million . The money he manages now belongs solely to him and his charitable foundations ( see " How Sir John Invests Today , " page 105 ) . Templeton remains a towering figure , one of the few enduring masters from whom every investor can learneven though his own focus these days is primarily on spiritual matters . He 's made it his mission to promote his ardent and deeply unusual belief that science can teach us " 100 times " more than we now know about spirituality . While we understand the human body better than our ancestors did , he argues , we 've learned little in 2,000 years about God and the soul . Passionate about mankind 's need for " rapid spiritual progress , " he funds scientific research-at institutions such as Harvard University-into mysteries like the healing power of prayer and forgiveness . " Does the prayer work only if the person who is sick does the praying ? " he asks . " Or can it be done by somebody else ? Those things have not been scientifically studied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund his spiritual programs , including a $1 million prize for " Progress in Religion . " His goal is to " help hundreds of millions , maybe billions , of people to have spiritual wealth . It 's the most fundamental need that humanity ever had . " While this may seem an odd departure for a celebrated stock picker , Templeton has always been startlingly differentand his idiosyncrasies are precisely what made him such a successful investor . He always went his own way , hunting for busted stocks at what he called the " point of maximum pessimism " - when no one else would touch them . As a spiritual missionary , he 's equally unconventional and convinced of his unorthodox wisdom . And perhaps that 's the point . Great investors , like great artists , are not like the rest of us . By studying Templeton , in all his strange and brilliant glory , maybe we can gain insight into just what it is spectacular investors possess that the rest of us do n't . The Willingness to Be Lonely AT 86 , TEMPLETON remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean up to his neck and propels himself rapidly for 45 minutes against the resistance of the water . Relentlessly driven , he derides the very notion of retirement , which he says produces legions of " idle people , useless people . " His houseguarded by an automated recording of a viciously barking dogoverlooks a golf course , but he refuses to be seduced by such hedonistic temptations : " I 've never found time for pleasure . My neighbors go out golfing and yachting , but my own viewpoint is that it 's far more important to be useful . " Templeton rarely thinks like the rest of us . And that has been one of his greatest strengths . In 1939 , he called his broker with a characteristically eccentric order . He wanted to invest $100 in each of 104 U.S. stocks , all trading at less than $1 a share ; 37 were in bankruptcy , but he bought them anyway Hitler had just invaded France . Templeton , then only 27 , thought a world war would electrify America 's shattered economy , saving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself that he borrowed $10,000 ( $117,000 in today 's dollars ) to make the investment . " Five years later , when I liquidated those holdings , I had a profit on 100 out of 104 of them , " he recalls . " I made roughly five times my money . " It was a remarkably plucky gamble . The only reason he could pull it off , he says , was that even then , " I had enough self-confidence to think that most of the people called experts could make big mistakes . " He credits his discipline-free childhood in Winchester , Tenn. : " I do n't remember either my mother or my father ever telling me , Do this ' or Do n't do that . ' They thought it would help me to become self-reliant and self-confident if I had to do everything myself . " Whatever its origin , Templeton 's profound belief in his own judgment is a quality he seems to share with other famed investors . Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services says that Templeton , Warren Buffett and George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the willingness to take a position that others do n't think is too bright . They have an inner conviction that a lot of people do not have . " Of course , there 's no better example of Templeton 's willingness to be lonely than his devotion to unusual spiritual ideas . " I 'm one of the few people in the world who do n't hesitate to say that spiritual information will multiply one hundredfold , " he declares . " Hardly anybody in the world will dare say that . " Always Fly Coach TEMPLETON 'S ATTITUDE toward money has always been distinctive . Gary Moore , a friend who advises religious investors , quips : " John is what we call a Calvinist . He believes it 's okay to make money so long as you do n't enjoy it . He 's still pretty tight " Templeton calls tithing the " single best investment " anyone can make and claims to give away $10 for each dollar he spends on himself . Obsessively thrifty , he boasts that he still flies coach : " I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bigger seat . " As a fund manager , he was famous among his employees for writing notes on scraps of used paper , which he 'd staple together into notepads : " I never thought it was wise to waste anything . After my education I had absolutely no money , and neither did my bride . So we deliberately saved 50 out of every dollar . " Templeton employs the same philosophy when he invests , says Mark Mobius , manager of the Templeton Developing Markets fund . It was Templeton 's miserly eye for a bargain that led him into foreign markets other Americans spurned . In the 1950s , when Japan 's economy was reeling and many Japanese stocks were trading at a P/E of three , he figured it was the world 's cheapest market . He snapped up unwanted gems like Hitachi and Fuji Film , betting 60% of his fund 's assets in a country ridiculed for producing cheap knockoffs . By 1980 , exuberant investors were piling into Japanese stocks , and Templeton , looking for cheaper buys , had almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Underlying Templeton 's compulsive cheapness is his belief that we do n't possess our own money ; we 're merely " temporary stewards " of God 's wealth and must shepherd it with appropriate care . " Be Here at 4:02 " TEMPLETON HAS similarly quirky notions about time . " John wo n't engage in small talk , " says John Galbraith , who marketed Templeton 's funds . " The minute you 're through with your common business , he 's onto something else . " He 's beyond punctual . His friend Gary Moore recalls : " The first time I met John , he said , Be here at 4:02 . I 've got another appointment at 4:13 . ' His determination to use every minute productively gave him a major edge in researching stocks . Most investors , he says , " do n't really understand what it is they 're buying . You have to be very industrious and very persevering so that your information will be better than that of other people . " He 's now equally relentless in analyzing spiritual matters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more facts , much more scientific research . " Nor does he plan to slow down : " You 're only on earth a small time . Do n't waste a minute of it " The Secret Weapon WHEN THE U.S. MARKET crashed in 1987 , Templeton loaded up on stocks that had been slaughtered . " He does n't get carried away by the emotions of Wall Street , " says Jay Bradshaw , who ran Templeton 's trading desk . " He said , Well , if we paid that much for Ford Motor before and it was good value then , it 's even better value now " ' This habit of diving in when stocks are getting crushed requires " tremendous willpower and strength of personality , " says Mobius . " Everybody else is running out of the burning building . " Templeton has always been just as immune to euphoria . In 1968 , when the U.S. market was surging to breathtaking heights , he was massively underweighted in U.S. stocks . The bubble burst , and many stocks fell 70% between 1969 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan and Canada-boasted a positive return of 50% . Templeton finished top of his class at Yale and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford . But a superb intellect is worth little in investing if you have the wrong temperament . " Most investors get led astray by emotions , " he says . " They get excessively careless and optimistic when they have big profits . They get too cautious and pessimistic when they have big losses .... I 've always worked on having more self-control . " His secret weapon ? His unerring ability to stay calm as an investor is bolstered by his religious faith , which seems to free him from fears and doubts that paralyze others . Convinced he 's a beloved child of God and that " spiritual wealth is vastly more important than monetary wealth , " he 's never been rattled by the market 's plunges . Even when he took a beating , says Templeton , " I never was depressed or despairing . Sidebar HOW SIR JOHN INVESTS TODAY Should regular investors buy individual stocks ? Only , declares Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more experience and more wisdom than professionals . " Otherwise , he says , they 'd do better to buy mutual funds . Which is precisely what he does now that he no longer wants to spend time doing exhaustive analysis . He does n't worry about funds getting too big or about paying hefty loads but focuses simply on picking the " wisest " managers : " By looking at long-term results , you get a reasonable idea who has more information and more diligence . Even then , you 're often wrong . " One pick that 's soured of late : the Brandywine Fund . Its manager , Foster Friess , made a disastrous bet a year ago that the U.S. market would crash , but Templeton is sticking with him . " Most investors are too impatient , " he says . " People who change from one fund to another as often as once a year are basing it more on emotion than investigation . " He 's also reassured by the fact that Friess is " very spiritual , " since " to be ethical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Ever contrarian , Templeton has been underweighted in the U.S. since the Dow hit about 6500 and has been buying heavily in Asia . He plunged into South Korea in December 1997 , stashing some $8 million in the Matthews Korea Fund . " Almost everyone thought everything was hopeless , " he says . " I thought it could hardly get any worse from a psychological and public relations standpoint . " Since August , he 's invested a similar sum in China ( he owns Templeton Dragon ) : " Prices are still quite cheap and the stability of the government is better than in Eastern Europe . " He 's also betting on Hong Kong ( " low prices and a relatively safe government " ) and Singapore . ( Other funds he owns include Templeton Growth , Templeton Foreign , Templeton Emerging Markets and Janus Overseas . ) He has n't invested in Russia but has a " small amount " in former Soviet countries like Poland , Slovakia , Kazakhstan and Estonia .
