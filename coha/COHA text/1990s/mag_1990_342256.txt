Shortly after he took over as chairman of Delaware-based E.I. Du Pont de Nemours two years ago , Edgar Woolard called a meeting of his company 's 325 top managers at Palm Beach , Fla . Looking out at a roomful of white men , peppered with fewer than a dozen women and minorities , the new boss delivered a stunning ultimatum . The next time Du Pont 's managers gathered , Woolard said , he 'd better see significantly more women and minorities in the room . Last March , when Woolard and 390 executives attended the company 's leadership conference in Chantilly , Va. , 25% of those present were women and minorities . Though not all of them had reached the top ranks , they were more than window dressing . By soliciting their views at such conferences , the company hopes it can root out biased attitudes and broaden its appeal to future workers . Du Pont , where Woolard started 33 years ago in a plant with a segregated cafeteria and where less than 20 years ago women with chemical-engineering degrees often started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And just in time . The U.S. is about to undergo the most wrenching shifts in the composition and quality of its work force in more than a half-century . While most companies have yet to come to grips with the new realities , the cold , hard fact is that corporate America is facing a deepening shortage of skilled labor in the decades just ahead . During the next 10 years , the U.S. population and the labor force will expand more slowly than at any other time since the 1930s . The work force grew by 3 million workers a year during the 1970s , but will swell by only 1.6 million new workers a year in the coming decade . For the first time in their working lives , U.S. managers are no longer able to pick and choose among an embarrassment of labor riches , but must compete harder than ever for well-educated workers . <P> At the same time , the face of the work force is changing dramatically . While the labor force will grow slowly over the next decade , two-thirds of the increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males and immigrants will account for much of the rest . Most startling , only 9.3% of the new workers will represent the population from which nearly all top corporate managers have sprung : white , non-Hispanic U.S.-born men . <P> These changes are becoming evident in the labor market . While women , for example , still face formidable obstacles on the road to top management , they have made dramatic inroads into occupations previously reserved mostly for men . Nearly 18% of doctors are now women , as are 22% of lawyers , 32% of computer systems analysts and nearly half of accountants and auditors . Over the next several years , women will make up the majority of new skilled and educated workers . <P> Though most firms have been slow to respond to these developments , smart managers searching for talent are already courting the women , African Americans , Hispanics , Asians and others whom corporate executives have traditionally discounted or dismissed . They are re-examining from top to bottom their personnel policies : the ways they find and recruit new talent , the incentives and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are learning that the new work force has different needs and are exploring ways to meet them .
