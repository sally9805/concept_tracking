<p> The black comedy of a White House on the verge of nervous breakdown <p> " It 's the worst job in the world , " said Sam Skinner . " Howard Baker said that when he was Reagan 's chief of staff . The worst . " <p> One month after Bush 's defeat on November 3 , 1992 , and Skinner was in his Elba , eating three kinds of popcorn out of a tin cylinder eight inches wide and two feet tall . The tin was that year 's omnipresent holiday offering ; every Republican office in Washington was inundated with popcorn supplied by friendly lobbyists , every word processing keyboard stained with the icky orange residue of the cheese flavoring and the sticky brown goo of the caramel . Skinner 's place of exile was a handsome office suite on the fourth floor of the Republican National Committee building on Capitol Hill . It had been his perch since August , when James Baker replaced him as White House chief of staff . <p> Skinner had arrived at the White House just a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff for eight months , and in all that time he never had a good day . The first major event of Skinner 's tenure was the president 's trip to Japan in January 1992 . That was followed in turn by the unsuccessful State of the Union address , and then Bush 's first campaign trip to New Hampshire , in which he attempted to demonstrate to people that he cares about them by speaking the immortal words " Message : I care . " And on and on it went , through an unbroken series of disasters and missed opportunities : the Rio summit , the Los Angeles riots , the great media flap over Dan Quayle 's speech insulting " Murphy Brown . " <p> Throughout the first half of 1992 , stretching into summer , staffers watched as their administration , once thought invincible , absorbed blow after blow and could not come up with a single thing that might improve Bush 's standing in the eyes of the voters . They would gather and regather at the feet of the Old Executive Office Building staircases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their way out at night . <p> Their conclusion was always the same : It was all Skinner 's fault , Skinner and the guys running the campaign . The one person who was not held responsible in these discussions was the president himself . The only acceptable way to criticize the president was to say that he was too trusting , too generous , especially about giving Skinner a chance . <p> They repeated the stories they had heard about how sure Bush was he was going to win , about how he had no doubts and did not want his people to worry . But the fact was , things were n't working well , and Only One Man Could Save Them . He was the Republican magus , James A. Baker III , Bush 's close friend of thirty five years , the man who had run every Republican campaign since 1976 and had won three of four . <p> Staffers would have been surprised to discover that Skinner agreed with them . By the summer Skinner had come to be very much in favor of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the key to the reelection . But he had believed Baker either would be put in charge of the campaign or would come into the White House as a Super Counselor . Either way , Skinner figured he could keep his title and some of his duties . So he had been shocked when , on an August Wednesday right before lunch , the president informed him that come ten the next morning , Skinner was to be banished from the White House . <p> Skinner 's evisceration came as a kind of spiritual deliverance to the White House staff , not because they disliked him but because their sense of justice had at last been satisfied . Things had gone horribly wrong , and somebody was finally taking the fall for it . The president 's decision to bring Baker on had confirmed their conviction that the problem lay in Skinner 's faulty management . Skinner , and only Skinner , had been the cause of all the administration 's troubles in 1992 . Skinner 's failure was not only a danger to the country 's future , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House staff . <p> The Baker team played this opinion for all it was worth . In the myriad articles written about Baker 's takeover of the White House , Baker 's people spoke of little else ( on background , of course ) but the parlous state of the place in Skinner 's wake . The clear implication was that if Bush did win in November , the credit would be entirely Baker 's , but if he lost , Skinner would be the one responsible . <p> But on that December day after the election , Skinner was actually one of the few Republicans in town cheerful and upbeat . He had just landed a $500,000 job as chairman of Commonwealth Edison . So while hundreds of his former employees woke with night sweats trying to figure out how , as loyal employees of a disgraced administration , they were going to meet their mortgage payments , Skinner was returning to his hometown , Chicago , perhaps a bit bloodied but basically unbowed . ( Upon hearing of Skinner 's hiring , one staffer immediately began calling around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock in Common wealth Edison to " sell short , for God 's sake , sell short ! " ) <p> But there was plenty of blame to go around for the defeat . Skinner certainly thought so : He constantly cited the role of his predecessor , John Sununu , and campaign chief Bob Teeter while belittling the significance of his own eight months in the chief of staff 's office . Those months had proved to be merely an interregnum between Sununu and Baker . " I was just an asterisk in history , " he said , only he pronounced the word " asterik . " It was , evidently , an important word to him ; later , he dismissed a mid-level staffer 's role in a key policy decision that year by calling her an " asterik , " too . <p> What had made the job especially frustrating , he said flatly , was that he had inherited " the weakest staff in White House history " from Sununu . " You wo n't find anyone to disagree with that , " Skinner said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouths of babes : Skinner had stumbled onto the truth . The management problems of the White House preceded his time there and did not go away when he left . The management problem of the White House was George Bush , and the singularly inept way he structured his own operation . <p> By dissing the White House staff , Skinner had merely put into words something that had been evident to people in the administration and elsewhere in Washington from January 20 , 1989 , onward . The White House staff , almost every member of which had been hired by Sununu himself , was astoundingly mediocre  --  politically shortsighted , ideologically deprived , inclined to inflate the importance of the trivial and discount the significant . <p> When the Bush administration began , Bush filled a few of the top jobs himself and left the rest to Sununu , his first chief of staff . The president 's insouciance about the structure and order of his own political operation turned out to be a key indication of how he was going to pursue his presidency . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort to get elected , he now wished to cleanse himself , to rise above it . He would leave all that to his famously brash and tough chief of staff and focus his attention on his consuming interest , foreign affairs . <p> While Bush was hunkering down with National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Secretary of State Baker , Sununu was busy assembling a White House manned by senior staffers whose chief assets were that a ) they would owe extraordinary allegiance to the chief of staff for elevating them above their natural stations in life , and b ) they would pose absolutely no threat to his complete dominion over all aspects of White House policymaking . <p> The weakness of Sununu 's staff was made manifest in the White House communications operation , which he drastically downgraded from its previous high standing in the Reagan White House . A Reagan-era director of communications was either a celebrated or glamorous figure in his own right or soon became one  --  David Gergen was the first , Pat Buchanan the second . The director of communications supervised the dissemination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearances and , of course , strategic leaking . <p> Sununu 's choice for the post was David Demarest , who had had the title during the campaign . But what he had done as director of communications for Bush/Quayle ' 88 was almost exclusively technical  --  setting up satellite feeds for candidate interviews , keeping track of which local media organs the candidate needed to hit on his relentless journey around the country . During the campaign , Demarest was not a speechwriter and did not participate in the making of policy , nor did he design a strategy to publicize and promote the candidate 's ideas . <p> Sununu took advantage of Demarest 's inexperience to gut the speechwriting operation , the most significant arm of the communications office . Now , the idea that a president did n't need especially good speechwriters might seem insane , especially when that president was George Bush , but Sununu and Bush had decided to pursue a communications strategy designed by press secretary Marlin Fitzwater . ( The press office under Reagan and Bush was independent of the communications operation . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to the American people not through speeches but in press conferences and informal interview sessions instead . Sununu kicked the speechwriting department out of its nice digs , and gave them instead to the deeply significant Thousand Points of Light office . Following this , he decreed that speechwriters would no longer be allowed to eat in the White House Mess . What was more , no speechwriter would be paid more than $40,000 . <p> But of all Sununu 's choices for the White House staff , easily the most consequential was Roger Porter . Porter was named assistant to the president for domestic policy . This is the title that had been given to Edwin Meese in the Reagan White House . Meese , perhaps Reagan 's closest personal adviser for twenty years , wanted to be to domestic affairs what the national security adviser was to foreign affairs  --  chief White House analyst and check on the ambitions of power-hungry bureaucrats in the cabinet departments and agencies . <p> It never quite worked out that way . Foreign affairs are relatively easy to supervise from the White @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments ( State , Defense and Central Intelligence ) . Almost everything else is domestic policy , and the sheer size of the federal government has dwarfed all efforts by domestic-policy assistants to achieve the degree of supervisory authority enjoyed by the national security adviser . ( Meese had also gutted the position , when he left the White House in 1985 to become attorney general , by arranging to remain chairman of its two cabinet forums , the Domestic Policy Council and the Economic Policy Council . ) <p> Even so , the position of domestic policy adviser was one of almost limitless possibility . Unfortunately , Porter proved a man of almost infinite limits . At a time when the Republican party was a wild ferment of new ideas and policies in fields from education to welfare , Porter proved singularly uninterested in the ideas and instead obsessed over detail  --  not what to do , but how to do it . One of Porter 's chief aides said he " was narcissistic about the paper on his desk " ; he held up the release of documents from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes complaining about the spacing of the tabs . <p> A visitor to Porter 's office noted that pride of place was given to a photograph of Porter himself in the company of none other than the first president he had served , Gerald Ford . Porter made frequent references to the Ford presidency , during which he had served as a paper pusher , as if that were the model that the present administration should emulate . <p> From the first day of the administration , Porter served as a kind of kid brother to the two actual domestic policy advisers , Sununu and Richard Darman . His status as an underling was confirmed when he accepted the job of taking the official notes at domestic policy meetings with the president . Porter 's weaknesses led to the marginalization of the often creative staff of wonks who made up the Office of Policy Development under his tutelage  --  another set of thinkers and potential policy competitors disposed of . <p> Sununu and Darman did their best to marginalize most of the cabinet as well . They were following the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a conspiracy to turn Secretary of State William Rogers into a powerless figurehead . But that was only one Cabinet secretary and one department ; Sununu and Darman tried the same thing on no fewer than ten . Sununu would , whenever he felt the need , simply dictate policy from his office ; Darman would , on the other hand , assert White House dominance and limit cabinet prerogatives by fiddling around with department budgets . <p> They were successful enough at this to wrest control of the economy away from Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady  --  which might have seemed a major feat , since Brady was not only treasury secretary but Bush 's best friend in Washington . <p> They found it easy to dominate Brady because it is never difficult to outwit a dimwit . When a rumor circulated around Washington that Brady was dyslexic , his people hotly defended him by saying , No , it was n't true he was dyslexic , he just had to read things really slowly because otherwise he could n't understand them . The dyslexia rumor gave rise to one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president took so long to acknowledge the recession because Brady was the person who drew the charts . <p> The few choices that Bush did make among the three-hundred-plus staffers in the White House were as telling in their way as Sununu 's , for with one exception , they , were people of no fixed opinions on the key issues affecting the country . They did not believe in anything very much except George Bush the man , and that was what mattered to the loyalty-crazed president . <p> He cited one of his first decisions in one of his final televised appearances before the nation , the second presidential debate . Asked what women he had as his closest advisers , he blanked for a minute and then spoke the words : " There 's Rose Zamaria . Tough as a boot , saving the taxpayers ' money . " The comment provoked groans all over Republicanland , and on the plane back from Richmond , Virginia , White House aides told each other that the " Zamaria debate " would go down in history as Bush 's worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth of choices . ) <p> Zamaria , who had been Bush 's secretary when he was a congressman in the mid-1960s , was not exactly the sort of high-ranking policy aide you might expect a president to name when asked about his closest advisers . But she was certainly close to him ; he saw Zamaria every day , which gave her standing many other more important staffers lacked . She was the person Bush put in charge of White House administration , supervising the secretaries and in possession of the ( theoretical ) key to the supply closet . She appealed to one of the less attractive aspects of his Yankee upbringing  --  the parsimony for parsimony 's sake that is a snobbish corruption of the Puritan emphasis on the godliness of thrift and the sin of waste . To that end , Zamaria roamed the halls of the West Wing , accusing people of taking paper clips home with them from the office making sure that her " girls " were not lolly-gagging , ordering people out of the Roosevelt Room if they arrived ten minutes early for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff lounge , y'know . She would approach senior female staffers in the Mess and upbraid them for not wearing stockings like a lady should . In short order , Zamaria became the single most detested person in the White House ( including Richard Darman ) and probably the entire administration . <p> For Zamaria had another , more important duty as well : She was in charge of White House perks . There were n't many of these , but they were choice : Getting entree into the president 's box in the opera house of the Kennedy Center and obtaining cuff links and tie clips with the presidential seal and signature on them were primary among these . In the Reagan years , it had been a matter of course for staffers to get into the box ; it was first-come , first-served , informal . <p> Unlike Reagan , Bush saw the perks as a political tool . Zamaria was administering the official White House favors because Bush wanted someone stingy to keep track of what he had done for his people . Gracious Bush certainly was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in his name , was considered payback for services rendered or an advance on services owed . <p> The hiring settled , Sununu 's White House staff worked according to the wishes of its designer . He had control of policy . He negotiated with Congress . <p> Sununu 's fall from power in 1991 came about not because Bush was unhappy with the quality of the White House staff , but because the press scandal over Sununu 's travel had become a political liability at a time when Bush 's sinking ratings in the polls called for some kind of major change . Since the president was not willing to introduce a major economic growth package , or even to apologize for having raised taxes in the 1990 budget deal , he had to make a personnel move . Sununu went . Skinner came . <p> Bush , however , refused to allow his new chief of staff to fix what was broken . Just before his arrival at the White House , Skinner gave an interview to The New York Times in which he suggested he might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new manager who had been brought in because the previous management had fallen into disrepair . But Bush , always unhappy to see such things in print , scolded Skinner for speaking so publicly . Perhaps as punishment for the indiscretion , he told Skinner in no uncertain terms that the White House staff was his , Bush 's , staff . He was not unhappy with their work . One or two major changes were as many as he or they could handle . Bush did n't want much to change . <p> The main change during Skinner 's tenure was not his new appointments but all the meetings . All there were were meetings . Endless meetings morning , noon and night . Scheduling meetings and communications meetings . Campaign meetings and Policy Coordinating Group meetings . Like a character in a movie by Bunuel , a staffer would enter the Roosevelt Room for a meeting and find that he and his companions were prevented by some mysterious force from rising and leaving the room . <p> Skinner got so bored and annoyed by the ditherings at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing the number of those in attendance from twenty-five to ten , and then created a weekly session called the chief of staff 's meeting to give senior staffers something to hang on to . <p> One by one , the senior staffers who had been disinvited came to Skinner . Media adviser Dorrance Smith said he really had to be at the morning meeting because otherwise how could he best advise the president on his media appearances ? And Skinner , perhaps mindful of the fact that Smith played tennis with the president twice a week , relented . <p> Thousand Points of Light chief Gregg Petersmeyer said he really had to be at the morning meeting to coordinate the efforts of his national service office , which did " interface " regularly with the public out there . And Skinner relented . Over the course of a month , almost everyone who had been disinvited from the senior staff meeting somehow made his or her way back into the room , until only two or three were left out  --  excluded , stewing , offended . The senior staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Later , when not only was Skinner in Elba but Bush was soon to be in an exile of his own , Skinner complained again and again that Bush 's loyalty to his staff made it impossible for Skinner to fix what was wrong at the White House . <p> Actually , Skinner had n't the least idea how to fix things . His only idea was to enlist the services of New York management consultant Eugene Croisant , who also happened to be his best friend of thirty years . When he first took over as secretary of Transportation in 1989 , Skinner had called on Croisant and found him invaluable in helping to turn his disparate staff into a team . This goal had been achieved by means of management retreats for the department 's senior aides , where they played games together so that they could learn to trust each other . <p> You might think that these touchy-feely , New Agey , post-1960s techniques would be anathema to Republicans , but you would be dead wrong . Management programs like Croisant 's have become part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts and even failures can be solved and resolved by a weekend at a really nice resort where people get to respect one another 's space and emerge with a whole new collegial spirit they can take back to their corporate headquarters and proceed to use in running yet another major American industry into the ground . <p> Croisant wandered through the White House for three weeks , asking staffers what they did and why . In the end , he made two recommendations to Skinner that any mildly intelligent member of the White House staff could have told him in thirty seconds . First , he recommended that Skinner hire a new director of communications to replace David Demarest . Skinner then spent two pointless months trying to hire Jim Lake , who had been communications honcho in the ' 80 , ' 84 , and ' 88 campaigns , but after a month 's jockeying Lake decided he could not afford to leave his lobbying business . Whereupon Skinner halted his search , explaining later that it was a very hard job to fill and he simply could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States of America who could do it besides Lake . <p> But he wanted to fire Demarest , anyway . Bush , who was very fond of Demarest , would not allow it . So instead Skinner gave Communications to Marlin Fitzwater , who already had more than enough to do running the White House press office . He made Demarest , who was no speechwriter , chief speechwriter . He then defenestrated the previous chief speechwriter , Tony Snow . But he did n't get rid of Snow either . Snow was moved across the hall from his office and was named director of media affairs , which basically allowed him to collect a salary , keep up his mortgage payments , and keep his health benefits while his wife had their first child . So as a result of this first piece of management advice , there were speechwriters sitting around who were n't allowed to write speeches , a communications director who was too busy with his real job to supervise three different White House offices , and a bunch of employees who were either overworked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire a management consultant for . <p> Croisant 's second and more significant recommendation was that Skinner create a counterbalance to Darman 's total control of domestic policy by appointing a new domestic policy adviser . His choice for domestic policy czar was Clayton Yeutter , chairman of the Republican National Committee , a nice man who was famous in Washington for emptying his in-box every day and having the most impressive collection of Rolodexes in a city that worshiped the Rolodex as an aborigine worships his totem . But nobody ever accused Yeutter of having an idea in his head , which is what a domestic policy czar is supposed to have . And rather than counterbalancing Darman , Skinner merely pissed him off and then backed down from this intention of marginalizing the OMB director . <p> To begin with , on the very day of Skinner 's arrival at the White House in 1991 , he was quoted in The New York Times as saying , " Dick Darman is a smart guy and he will be one of  --  and I stress one of  --  the president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so close that their offices had special phones that rang directly between them ; Skinner had Darman 's " drop line , " as it was called , removed . Darman lay low until three weeks later , when Skinner was quoted in a National Journal article calling Darman " a nice young man . " <p> For reasons only a psychiatrist could understand , this remark drove Darman ( who was only three years younger than Skinner ) into a frenzy . He raged like Lear to his two closest aides , Tom Scully and Bob Grady . He was going to get Skinner . He was going to cut his balls off . That pip-squeak did n't know who he was dealing with . He was going to call Junior- " Junior " being the misappellation for Bush 's son George W. , who served as a back channel to the president for select staffers . <p> Darman got hold of himself and called Skinner 's office . The chief of staff was traveling that day , so Darman passed his message on to Skinner 's assistant , Cam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's okay , he told Findlay  --  knowing ' full well that because he was a presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate , the chief of staff did not have that power , only the president did  --  but this sort of public humiliation is unacceptable . And Darman proceeded to read through all the statements Skinner had made about him to the press , citing each one by newspaper or magazine , page number , column number , and paragraph number . " I am not going to allow my reputation to be destroyed , " Darman told Findlay . <p> Skinner and Darman ended up that December 1991 afternoon in the deputy chief of staff 's office and had a " full and frank discussion , " as the State Department briefers in the 1980s used to describe heated negotiating sessions between the U.S. and the Soviets . Skinner acknowledged that he should not have dissed Darman in print but acknowledged that he wanted a domestic policy operation in the White House independent of the OMB director . <p> He did n't get one . Yeutter was not equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty people working for him while Darman had two hundred career analysts working for him at OMB who could run numbers and come up with a report about a hundred times faster than the Office of Policy Development . <p> And so Skinner found himself again in the same situation he had been in over the directorship of communications : Although he had hired Yeutter , Bush would not allow him to fire the previous domestic policy adviser , Roger Porter . So there were two domestic policy advisers in the place , both of whom had call on the same underlings . <p> Finally , even Bush had to act . So Baker came to the White House and Skinner was out . <p> Five days after his firing , while he was still technically chief of staff , Skinner was in Houston at the Republican National Convention . It was Tuesday night , August 18 , 6:30 p.m. , in front of the J.W. Marriott Galleria Hotel , and it was time for Republicans to head out to the Astrodome . Cabinet secretary Ede Holiday and her aide Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quayle looking for Holiday 's car . Holiday 's driver told her the authorities had insisted the car be parked in a lot around the corner and not in front of the hotel to keep the streets clear . As a result , nobody 's car was where he expected it to be ; White House counsel Boyden Gray was pacing in front of his hotel , looking confused and a little desperate . Holiday and Lefkowitz and driver headed down to the corner , where they bumped into Skinner and his wife , Honey . <p> Holiday and Honey blew air kisses at one another as an unsmiling and preoccupied Sam said , " You have any idea where the cars are ? " <p> " We 're going around the corner to see if our car is there , " Holiday said . They continued along the cobble-stoned sidewalk , Honey 's high-heeled shoes losing the war with the cobblestones . As they turned the corner , there was only the one car , Holiday 's , in sight . <p> " Well , I do n't see ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who only six days before would have ordered Lefkowitz to go find Skinner 's car or made the ultimate sacrifice of insisting that he take her car  --  only fitting for a man who only six days before had played a gigantic role in her professional and emotional life  --  now merely said , " Okay , good luck , Sam . See you later , Honey . " <p> As they crossed the street to the lot , Lefkowitz murmured sadly : " Jesus , the guy ca n't even get a ride .
