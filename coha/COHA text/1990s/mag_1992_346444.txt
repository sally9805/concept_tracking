Spring was suddenly in the air , a little later than usual , and trees were tardily emerging from their long winter dormancy , budding and flowering with vigor . Arboreal petals opened , exposing pollen-covered anthers to the breezes , which wafted pollen grains into the air , carrying some of them for many miles . By June , while the late-blooming trees were still in blossom , flowering grasses began contributing to the airborne assault , and many regions in the East began reporting record pollen counts . <P> As nature intended , the sheer number of pollen grains  --  the botanical bearers of sperm  --  ensured that at least some would reach and adhere to their natural goal : the stigma , a moist and sticky receptor of the female organ of the flower . That would start a fertilization process eventually resulting in seed and the propagation of the species . As a result of one of nature 's oversights , however , many of the pollen grains reached another moist and sticky target first : a human eye or the mucous membranes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chain of events with a decidedly different outcome . <P>  --  " It 's been hell , " says Mari Cox , 37 , a medical assistant in Kansas City , Kans . A wet spring and wind in the region have whipped up pollen counts , so debilitating Cox that she has n't been gardening  --  her hobby  --  or even playing with her five kids . Instead she is lying low , taking antihistamines and decongestants . " I 'm miserable , " she says . <P>  --  On a Fire Island beach near New York City , weekenders are peacefully sunbathing when the wind suddenly rises , blanketing them with swirling clouds of pollen . Coughing , wheezing , their eyes tearing , some of the bathers beat a hasty retreat from the beach . " It was just like yellow smoke , " says an awestruck city dweller . <P>  --  " The new grass , the trees , especially those goofy cottonwood things that fly around here , " laments Dorothy Jiganti , 48 , an oncology nurse at Chicago 's Grant Hospital . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take your pills , she says , " you just feel like you 've got a cold all the time . It 's a constant feeling of blah . " <P> The malady afflicting these people is allergic rhinitis , more commonly called hay fever . It has nothing to do with hay and rarely produces a fever , but the Medical Gazette used that term in 1829 , and the name stuck . The years since have produced no vaccine , no guaranteed cure and ever rising numbers of sufferers . In the U.S. alone , the sneezing , wheezing , teary-eyed multitudes are now estimated at 22 million . <P> What has improved is scientific understanding of the mysterious chain reaction that causes tiny pollen grains to make a human being miserable . Fresh insights into the process , combined with the new techniques of molecular biology and genetic engineering , offer hope that this plague will someday be brought under control .
