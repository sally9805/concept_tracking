Snowshoes have come a long way since the days of wood , rawhide , and leather . Unlike the old , beat-up pair mounted above the fireplace in the ski lodge , today 's snowshoes are simple to use , high-tech , and durable . They are constructed of sturdy , lightweigt metals and materials , the stuff mountain bikes and wet suits are made of . Although snowshoe technology has evolved , the reasons for strapping them on remain much the same . Dating back to 6000 B.C. , Eskimos and Indians relied on snowshoes for general winter transportation and for hunting . Still used for transportation , but with a ' ' 90s twist , snowshoes have become a fun , relatively inexpensive , trendy tool for a variety of activities : fitness walking , hiking , racing , cross-training , and backcountry travel for skiers and snowboarders . Basically , if you can walk , you can snowshoe . And considering that walking is the number-one fitness activity in the U.S. , with more than SO million participants , chances are the sport of snowshoeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fitness level , can strap on a pair and go just about anywhere that is snow-covered for a low-stress , low-impact walk or run . You can also do it anytime . At night , snowshoe by moonlight or wear a headlamp to light the way . Winter hiking does n't have to be strenuous ; you can simply stroll about and enjoy the serenity of winter terrain . Or for an excellent cardiovascular workout , walk briskly , jog , or run . At the same time , you 'll develop leg strength and endurance without the jarring impact of pounding on a hard surface . Because snow is a forgiving surface , the stepping action of snowshoeing , especially hill climbing ( my favorite ) , is similar to doing the StairMaster  --  except you 're outdoors . Depending on the snow conditions and the size of your snowshoe , for every step down , you might sink anywhere from a few inches to a couple of feet . Snow can spill over the tops of your shoes , giving you resistance on the step up . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some cross-country areas offer lessons , snowshoeing is a sport you can easily learn by doing . In fact , it literally takes about 10 steps to go from being a beginner to an intermediate . You can also ask a salesperson at a shop that sells or rents shoes for tips , or even read the instructional booklets that come with new shoes . It 's that easy . Snowshoes are inexpensive compared with Alpine skiing equipment . An initial investment of about $100 to $300 is all you need to get going . And you never need to spend $40 on a lift ticket . Snowshoes are also simple to fit . Most are adjustable , and you usually wear your own sneakers or boots . The type of snowshoe you choose will depend on the use and the snow conditions . A midsize model ( around nine by 30 inches ) makes a fine general-purpose snowshoe , good for a variety of activities ( walking , climbing , running ) , terrain , and snow conditions . If you 're going to spend a lot of time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger shoe , which provides more flotation . For steep terrain , ice , and traversing hills , you might opt for a small shoe ( around eight by 25 inches ) , perhaps with heavy-duty crampons for traction . You might also want to look for a smaller narrow shoe or an asymmetrical model if you plan to do a lot of power walking or running . This will allow your feet to come closer for a more natural stride . Regardless of the type of shoe you choose , and the style of snowshoeing you prefer , snowshoeing is a perfect way to discover nature in the wintertime and get fit . Though there 's safety in numbers and tromping around the woods with friends can be great fun , it 's also a perfect sport to do solo . At the very least , a quiet walk in the woods on snowshoes will do as much for your head as it does for your body . Getting Started * Sporting-goods stores in mountain resort areas will probably have snowshoe in rentals ( including children 's models ) available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rent first . Many retailers will apply the rental price toward a purchase , but demo several models before you buy . Retailers can also suggest good sites for snowshoeing. * Dress in warm breathable layers to protect against the elements . ( Snowshoeing is a blast even in severe weather if you 're prepared . ) Recommended accessories : gaiters ( the kind that cover your whole ankle and strap under your foot ) , gloves , neck warmer , headband , hat , goggles , sunglasses , sunscreen , day pack , water bottle , and packable snacks like PowerBars. * It 's possible to snowshoe anywhere there 's snow , but you can also follow designated trail systems in national forests or parks , at cross-country ski touring centers , and even at some Alpine ski areas . * For long day hikes or backcountry trekking , check with local rangers for condition updates and regulations . And bring a map of the area . Technique Tips * Ski poles are a good idea if you 're just starting out ; they help with lateral balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jogging , I like my hands free . * While stepping , think of pedaling a bicycle , with lots of flexion and extension through the ankles . * While running , try using your normal gait . But if you have a problem with the tail of the snowshoe hitting the snow first , try running on the balls of your feet , then flex your toe toward your shin to lift the shoe out of the snow . * On hills , try to exert even pressure along your whole foot so that the crampons can get an adequate grip . * Avoid having to back up , because the tails of some models will stick in the snow , and you 'll end up flat on your back . * Do n't step too close to partially covered rocks , trees , or shrubs . Wind can create deep snowless air pockets , so you may sink farther than you expect . * If you 've come from sea level to altitude , take it slowly and drink plenty of water . * Most important : This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise , people , and responsibility . Anatomy of Snowshoe The popularity of fitness walking has broken trail for snowshoe companies not only in participation , but in technology . Snowshoes come in different shapes , sizes , and materials and are mounted with different binding systems . Following are the basic components . Frame : The skeletal shape of the shoe ; can either be made of wood or lightweight metal . The most popular frame shapes are elongated oval , teardrop , asymmetrical , and symmetrical . They come in different sizes , too , from small to large . Binding : The device that secures snowshoe to foot . With a step-in binding , you wear winter boots or hiking boots , slip your foot in , and adjust the fit with straps or laces . Some come with insulation , like neoprene flaps , to keep feet warm . With a Nordic plate system , you wear a Nordic ski boot . And with a racing system , there 's a mount plate that accommodates running shoes . Decking : The solid or webbed surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Usually made of polyurethane- or neoprene-coated nylon . Crampons : Sharp aluminum , titanium , or stainless-steel teeth that grip the snow for better traction . Especially important for icy conditions and going up , down , and across steep hills : All modern snowshoes have crampons , but some shoes have stronger , longer ones , or more of them . Pivot : A metal or nylon hinge ( a strap or rod ) under the forefoot that allows your foot and ankle to flex and extend fore and aft . <p>
