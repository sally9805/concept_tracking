Not only do the dozen or so pills they must swallow each day cost a fortune  --  up to $10,000 a year  --  but they also cause terrible side effects : nausea , vomiting , fatigue and unsightly fatty deposits in the upper body . So it 's not surprising that some patients slip from time to time and take what they call drug holidays . <P> The problem , of course , is that HIV takes no such breaks . When the pills stop , the virus roars back  --  except sometimes it does n't .

In two of the patients , the virus rebounded and remained at high levels until they went back on their medications . But in the other two , intriguingly , the virus spiked briefly and then went into hiding  --  staying below detectable levels for at least 14 months . <P> While patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could it be that the HIV spikes function as booster shots , priming the body 's immune system to rally against the virus ?
