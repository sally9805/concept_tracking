Section : HOME OFFICE : 2020 CAN IT BE THAT FOR OUR INTREPID YOUNG HEROINE IN THE BIG APPLE OF 2020 , LIFE MEANS MUCH MORE THAN GIRL INTERFACES BOY , GIRL LOSES BOY , GIRL INTERFACES BOY BACK AGAIN ? <p> Arno Penzias , as one might expect from a man whose accomplishments include a Nobel prize , has interesting insights into the nature of the information revolution . Fortunately for us , he 's distilled those insights into a remarkable-and remarkably readable book called Ideas a Now available in paperback , and in editions around the world , Penzias 's book provides an enticing look at the shape a new , information-oriented world might assume . <p> This is no starry-eyed bundle of optimism . Penzias is all too aware of the problems and challenges computers can generate , even as they are introduced by their champions as the solution to all problems . Rather , in clear and thoughtful prose , Penzias walks the reader through the very crucial difference between information , and its more important relative , idea . The distinction is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successful integration of computer technology into our lives . <p> Better than most writers , Penzias builds his arguments carefully , buoying them with examples from his own life and work . Since his work includes being director of research at Bell Laboratories , on the very front lines of the Information Age , Penzias 's perspective is well grounded In technological realities , even as his imagination soars toward the future . <p> " 2020 " is worthwhile reading for anyone interested in the nature of the machines that are transforming our world . Keith Ferrell <p> <p> " What a way to celebrate my twentieth birthday ! " Rachel blinked hard a couple of times to relieve her tired eyes , and squeezed the trigger of her laser pistol . In response , a tiny dot of red light sparkled one huge electric generator opposite her . A slight motion of her wrist swung the spot around a squarish opening . <p> " Now , replace the cover plate over that section , " she told the robot . <p> " Okay , Rachel , you got it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you marked with your laser beam . I 'll get back to you as soon as I 'm done . " <p> They had been at this for more than four hours , and the robot 's unflagging enthusiasm was beginning to grate on her nerves . <p> Con Edison 's robotic voice response units lacked some of the amenities of newer models . No automatic mood adjustment , for one . <p> Rachel moved to the control console and called up the appropriate menu . The voice response selection she had made earlier popped up on the screen : " Male , young adult , cheerful . " <p> Time for a change . She replaced " cheerful " with " subdued . " <p> " How much longer will the cover replacement take ? " she asked . <p> " Approximately three minutes . " <p> Much better . <p> " Next , check all the vacuum seals , and get ready to refuel the cryogenics . " <p> " Acknowledged , Rachel . According to my records , my present task will complete the reassembly of this generator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacuum check and reseal procedures . These tasks should take a total of twenty-seven minutes . I will notify you if my estimate changes by more than ten percent , Rachel . " <p> With the robot busily engaged , Rachel switched off the rock video she had been playing as background music and turned her attention back to dictating an account of the morning 's work into the maintenance log . <p> " January 1 , 2020 ; 8:37 A.M. " began , glancing down at the screen to check the exact time . Fortunately , the coffee was still hot . <p> She took a sip and picked up the faulty sensor that had ruined her plans for New Year 's Eve . Finding it in the early hours had tested her ability to stay awake as much as her analytical skills . Both came with the territory . Con Ed 's program was supposed to give interns hands-on responsibility , and this experience certainly fit that category . <p> As Rachel dictated , she pictured Joe Scanlon 's reaction to her story . The maintenance supervisor 's veiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd shown him ! But her party dress was hanging in the closet , and here she was in jeans and sneakers with just a robot for company . <p> Uh-oh . She 'd lost her train of thought . " Come on , Rachel , get back on the ball , " she told herself . A single keystroke , and her terminal screen brought up a typed text of the material she had just been dictating . She saw where her narrative had begun to stray . Backing up the recording to that spot , she began again . No sense quitting when you 're almost done . <p> About an hour later , Rachel emerged with briefcase in hand from the power plant into pale winter sunshine . First Avenue was unnaturally quiet , with most New Yorkers still resting from their New Year 's Eve celebrations . The fresh air felt good , and she began to cheer up . <p> She walked two blocks north and soon reached the shelter at the nearest bus stop . " When will the next number-nineteen bus arrive ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved close to the microphone and cupped her hand to one side . On normal days , traffic noise tended to confuse the bus stop 's voice-recognition system , forcing some would-be users to repeat their questions . <p> " The next number-nineteen bus will arrive in approximately eleven minutes . More than fifty percent of the seats are vacant at this time . " <p> " I 'm going crosstown on Fifty-seventh Street . How long will I have to wait for a westbound bus ? " <p> " Approximately fourteen minutes . Holiday schedules apply today . " <p> " I want to get to Fifty-eighth Street and Ninth Avenue . Is there a faster way ? " <p> " No faster routes are available this morning . " <p> " Thanks , " Rachel said unnecessarily . Even though talking computers had been part of her life since childhood , she could n't help speaking to them as if they were people . <p> With more than ten minutes to kill before the bus arrived , she decided to check her mail . Reaching inside her coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . " Home control , please , " she said . Since it was too cold to retrieve her laptop from the briefcase at her feet , she elected to receive spoken summaries of her messages . <p> " There are eleven items in the active file , including four new ones , " her home computer reported . " Two were received in facsimile form and appear to be unsolicited advertisements . One is from the Student Travel Agency , and the other contains a discount coupon on pizzas for Fordham University students . " <p> " I do n't want to see the travel flier , but save the pizza coupon . What else ? " <p> " A seventy-nine-word E-mail message from Professor Lynch . Shall I read it to you ? " <p> " Yes , go ahead . " <p> " ' Rachel . I 've just finished matching up next semester 's internship preferences with the available slots and am happy to tell you that you are getting your first choice . Your contact will be ROBertO SALAZAR . Working in a cosmetics packaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that 's the idea . We want our M.B.A . ' s to experience the full range of the business world . I 'll be anxious to read your term paper on Con Edison . Good luck , Rachel . " ' <p> " Remind me to call Salazar tomorrow afternoon , and cross-index him under ' Spring Semester . " ' <p> " I have added the reference and will call ROBOSALAZAR to find out when Mr. Salazar will be available to speak with you . " <p> " Fine . What else do you have ? " <p> The final item was a short voice message from Michael . " Hi , it 's one minute to midnight . Happy New Year and happy birthday . I 'll call you tomorrow . " <p> " Happy New Year to you , too , " she whispered to herself , hurt that he had n't added anything more personal . Breaking their New Year 's Eve date to baby-sit that ailing superconducting generator had put a momentary crimp in their relationship . But the job had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her thoughts as it slid to a stop in front of her . <p> Once on board , she selected a seat in an empty row . Firmly resolved to put Michael out of her mind , she retrieved her laptop computer from the briefcase , and activated the unit 's voice input by pressing the multicolored broach pinned to her collar . A Christmas present to herself . Like most of her friends , Rachel changed lapel microphones to match her clothes and mood . Next , she snapped her pocket telephone into its socket on the laptop and almost immediately received a login prompt from the network servers . After establishing her identity via a short , spoken dialogue , she retrieved an electronic camera from her briefcase and proceeded to transfer the photos she had taken that morning into the system 's image files . <p> The term paper was in pretty good shape . The history section reviewed the prolonged battles over the greenhouse effect that ultimately transformed the world 's mix of energy sources , and how the world 's industrial powers had not only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financed a global program of power generation based on nuclear energy . " Not bad , " she thought , but the more recent developments needed polishing . Topic by topic , she proceeded to shape the reference material she had assembled into readable paragraphs-continuing progress toward fusion energy , the competition between French and Japanese firms supplying fail-safe fission reactors for the U.S. market , and the rates at which users of fossil fuels were converting to electricity or electrically created hydrogen . <p> Supplementing her voice inputs with the laptop 's touch screen and keyboard , she proceeded to assemble the rest of her report . A quick call to the New York Public Library produced a nice Washington Post photograph of the massive antinuclear rally that marked the high point of the controversy . Scaling it to size , she inserted the image at an appropriate point in the text and authorized payment of the fee for its use , but only after making sure that she would only be charged the " noncommercial " rate . <p> The imminent arrival of the bus at Fifty-eighth Street interrupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . Instead of logging off , however , she merely used her cordless microphone to continue dictating . By the time she was seated in the crosstown bus , she had finished first drafts of all the remaining sections . She decided to defer reviewing the typed copies that the automatic dictation system had created until she could confirm that the overhauled generator was back in service . More out of habit than real interest , she reopened her laptop and scanned the TV listings . Idly , she flicked on a game show . While Rachel usually enjoyed competing against other viewers , and had even won once , today 's topic did n't really interest her . " If all else fails , there 's always more homework , " she thought as she flipped to the university 's " classroom " screen and downloaded a videotape of a seminar she had missed . <p> Rachel 's class did not meet in traditional classroom lectures . Instead , the professor and his students met via multimedia conferencing . Since Rachel had n't been at her workstation at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defaulted to her personal " answering machine , " giving her a televised recording of the proceeding . <p> Starting the playback , Rachel saw the familiar row of snapshot-size windows across the top of her screen . Most contained televised head-and-shoulder images of the professor and the other students . Only hers and that of another absentee remained blank . Small icons indicated that both absentees were getting real-time video recordings for later review . Each participant saw a similar screen and could converse with the others in a face-to-face manner , thanks to small video cameras mounted atop each workstation 's display . <p> The major portion of the screen provided a space that served as a multimedia " blackboard . " In order to reinforce a point about the effects of technology on productivity , the professor started by showing a film clip of a corporate file room taken in the early Nineties . <p> " Hard as it is to believe today , " he began , " most office work depended on paper records as recently as twenty-five years ago . In the early Nineties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a trillion paper documents each year in the United States alone . Placed side-by-side , one year 's filing cabinet production would have spanned the entire North American continent from ocean to ocean . " <p> " But they had facsimile and mass storage media in those days , did n't they ? " one student asked . <p> " Yes , but it took a while to integrate the pieceparts . Imagine how it must have been , fumbling through papers by hand , instead of just letting an optical character reader scan the stored images and get the meaning out . What a waste ! As you know , computer manufacturers advertised ' paperless offices ' as early as the Sixties . But those systems only accommodated typed data . No wonder they did n't work . <p> " Bad as America 's office productivity was in the last century , Japan 's was even worse . As U.S. manufacturers began to match Japan 's factory productivity in the Nineties , the Japanese could no longer afford to maintain their antiquated office methods , especially since Japan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain massive defense budgets ...... <p> The lecture continued , but Rachel 's attention wandered . A blinking icon indicated an incoming call from Michael . She stopped the lecture and took the call . To her surprise , Michael 's face did n't appear on her screen . Instead , she found herself looking at a half-grown German shepherd , comfortably scratching its ear . <p> " Hi . We 've just come back from a run through Central Park , " she heard Michael say as he moved into view . " We had a great time , but Ludwig is covered with mud . How about coming over and helping me give him a bath ? I 'd offer to make lunch , but I do n't have much in the house . " <p> " That 's okay . " Rachel smiled . " I 'll bring along a pizza .
