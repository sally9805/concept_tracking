<p> Bill says Microsoft just wants to make good software . So how will it end up owning Sintara tunes ? <p> Go ahead and hate Bill Gates , if you want . But hate him for the right reasons . <p> Do n't hate him for his clunky software . Do n't hate him for his unimaginable wealth ( largely on paper anyway ) . Do n't hate him for what he is ( a bore ) . Hate Gates because he ca n't help himself . He must squash his rivals , intimidate his allies , and treat his customers with a mixture of affection and resentment . Hate the system that produced him and that wo n't let him rest until the perverse logic of the information age plays out . Hate Bill Gates for what he will become  --  not the quintessential robber baron , but a 21st-century Wizard of Oz . We need not grasp the technicalities of software to decode his future . We need only consult a formula as low-tech as a cake mix : Take some garden-variety insights into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about human nature , stir briskly , and  --  presto !  --  the arc of Gates ' life comes into view <p> What drives him ? Is it greed ? Lust for power ? Vanity ? Pure genius ? These questions overshoot the mark . His compulsions are less grand , his talents too elusive , to justify rarefied riddles . At bottom , Gates is a postmodern PI Barnum , a master at educating the great unwashed about their latent desires for computers . But Gates is no puppeteer . Like Henry Ford , who tried to put a car in every driveway , he is a slave to the mass audience . Mammon is pulling his strings . <p> " One size fits all " - this maxim sums up Gates ' deepest believe Though derided by elitists , the standardization of the personal computer has always been the source of its ubiquity Gates saw this even as a fledgling student at Harvard . Envisioning a computer on everyone 's desk , he earned his reputation as a rebel with a keyboard by dropping out of college . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to insist on payment for his programs and to equate copying software with theft . <p> Two decades later , Gates utterly dominates desktop software . Why not declare himself a winner and call it quits ? In my many conversations with Gates this past decade , he 's never shown even a glimpse of slowing down . The marriage of electronics and communications is making it possible to compute on the run , anywhere , anytime , and for any purpose . This new landscape  --  some call it cyberspace , others prefer the less glitzy term " electronic commerce " - has forced Gates to expand his sights . His prime directive is now something like this : If you exist , I make money <p> Take this literally For Gates to prosper in the next century , every move you make , every step you take , will earn him money . Lots of it . <p> For this to be true requires no grand conspiracy , only the logic of digital electronics and Gates ' capacity to straddle its breathtaking expanse . At 42 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to outmaneuver the upstarts nipping at his heels . While he owns little content , his experience as a definer of software standards puts him in a better position than anyone else to control the package in which information is delivered . At a time when information is separating from its traditional physical shell , whoever controls the delivery package will control the lion 's share of the profits . <p> Until now , information was virtually identical to its husk . The value of The Sun Also Rises was realized only in its paper form . Kind of Blue , the classic Miles Davis recording , was peddled as a piece of vinyl . What happens when the information can be retrieved instantly , wirelessly , and without further need for storage ? What happens when it does n't exist at all except at the point of consumption ? <p> Consider one possible outcome of this trend : Imagine it is 2025 , and you are shopping for a new stereo system . For little more than the cost of an old rig , you can buy one outfitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requiring an expensive library of CDs , the Microsoft model frees you from actually owning any recorded music . The machine lets you download any tune in the massive Sony/ Columbia library ( oh , forgot to mention that Microsoft bought Sony in 2010 ) by calling out its name . You gleefully shout , " Sinatra , My Way ' " and grin when Frank 's voice booms out . <p> In today 's lingo , Microsoft Music would be a service , a kind of custom radio on demand . For each airplay , Microsoft would impose a tiny charge , keeping track of the charges with its spreadsheet software and automatically withdrawing payment from your bank account . Conceivably , Gates could assemble the information he would need to launch Microsoft Music by forging partnerships with owners of recorded music . But since his service would ultimately destroy demand for the artifact  --  the record , CD , or whatever the music moguls come up with next  --  content owners probably wo n't let Gates lay his hands on their booty . Sooner or later , Gates will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , books , movies- you name it , he 'll need to merge it into his software . <p> Now a disclaimer . I have a vested interest in seeing Gates as a Disney , a Time Warner , or a Dow ones . In the six years 1 covered Microsoft for a daily news paper , I repeatedly needled Gates by suggesting that he would inevitably become the : greatest acquisitor in human history He protested against this loudly , never deviating from his party line : He is a builder , not a buyer . He simply wants to provide tools to help manage information and entertainment products created by others . He says that when he moves into content , such as his Encarta CD encyclopedia he builds products from scratch . <p> Yet Gates is famous for contradicting himself ; unlike many lesser tycoons , he would rather be right than consistent . If he says he 'll never do something , you can figure that before long it will become his first option . So beware when he protests too much . If the Web offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and content is disappearing . In order to dominate one , you must dominate both . <p> In the end , Bill Gates must buy himself a whole new set of toys . He will buy so many companies , in so many seemingly disparate industries , that his critics today will pine for the time when he was merely the king of software . <p> Again , this will not flow from greed , but from deep technical shifts that even Gates , with all his power , must bend to . Technology is making it possible to mediate all of human experience through a computer , from shopping to education to sex . Never mind that these computers may masquerade as CD players , cell phones , dashboards , or even electronic chips embedded in the body . No matter what they look like , they 'll all handle information in essentially the same way . Books , movies , music , the temperature in your bedroom , the groceries you buy  --  all this information will exist in a single digital format : the world as a string @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This mass digitization has huge implications for capitalism . Under the lash of computerization , five big industries ( computers , communications , publishing , electronic hardware , and entertainment ) are collapsing into one . This is the mother of all business trends , and it gives Gates an unmatched chance to expand his influence . Even if he wanted to stay in his software cocoon , he can not . The emergence of a digital mega-industry means Gates must diversify or die . <p> Even then , Gates remains vulnerable to the same improbable process that allowed his own company to slay IBM in the 1980s . One need look no further than the ascension of Netscape . Gates failed to grasp the importance of the Web until Netscape had nearly won the game . Chastened by having to claw his way into Web software , which he now dominates , Gates is unlikely to make this mistake again . Still , Microsoft 's very size means Gates must always worry that he ca n't see his toes anymore because his stomach is so large . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When it is transformed into a computer outfitted with maps , tourist information , and perhaps even movies , software programs will be written to manage all the buzz in the front seat . When the toaster talks , it will need a software interface . When the cell phone takes dictation , it will require a sophisticated program . If any or all of this software becomes popular , someone will decide to use it on a desktop or home computer , because it will serve the same person , after all . In other words , these programs will invade Gates ' turf . <p> Better , Gates knows , to beat his rivals to the punch . <p> So what does Gates need ? The answer is clear : ownership on a scale heretofore unknown in history . That he will likely use his assets not for malevolent ends but to abet the human weakness for endless self-amusement should in no way reduce our concern . This suggests that the costs of confronting Gates head-on will be high . It is fashionable to argue that if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a series of Keep Out signs , then it will defuse the incendiary situation arising from his power . Ralph Nader may apply the same hoary tactics against Microsoft that he used against General Motors , but he wo n't have nearly the same success ( and not just because Gates is more likely to embrace him than surveil him ) . Technology wo n't permit fence building , around Gates or any other digital baron . It is n't enough to keep Gates from , say , controlling the Web , because in the end the Web may only be a way station to an unknown destination . If neither the government nor the public can divine that destination , then surely Gates has the room he needs to make the biggest score of his life . <p> Unquote : Microsoft has already become a store  --  selling cars , vacations , and other services  --  on its sites . And while it might not exactly become a bank , Microsoft will be drawing money off of your smallest everyday activity . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how will it end up owning Sinantra tunes . <p> Bill at age 3 with mother Mary <p> With co-founder Paul Allen in 1981 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : During his senior year in high school at Seattle 's Lakeside School <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Announcing MSNBC in 1996 with ( from left ) NBC president Bob Wright , Jane Pauley , NBC News ' Andy Lack , Microsoft 's Peter Neupert , and Brian Williams <p> Gates ' $50 million dream home under construction in Medina , Washington <p> By G.
