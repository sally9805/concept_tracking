airports , schools , dams , water purity , and waste disposal facilities in the next century // SCHOOL BUILDINGS literally are crumbling ; more than half of U.S. roadways are in substandard condition ; airports will face gridlock by 2004 ; and tens of thousands of people become ill each year from contaminated drinking water . Accordingly , it is fair to say the nation 's infrastructure is in pretty bad shape . Without substantial help , the situation is not going to get any better . The American Society of Civil Engineers has released a Rz-port Card for America 's Infrastructure , assigning letter grades for the nation 's public infrastructure and environment . The ASCE gave the U.S. an average grade of " D , " and said it will require more than one trillion dollars and a new national public-private partnership to fix it . The grades were determined by a panel of civil engineering experts who evaluated each category on the basis of condition and performance , capacity , and funding . The worst went to schools , which received an " F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was rated a " C. " Hazardous waste and roads got a " D- " ; drinking water and dams a " D " ; wastewater a " D+ " ; and bridges , solid waste , and aviation a " C- . " By comparison , when the National Council on Public Works Improvement graded the condition of America 's infrastructure in 1988 , the overall rating was " C. " The nation 's public works are public assets . All Americans have a stake in their upkeep and operation , and share in the expense of construction and maintenance . Infrastructure often is paid for through tolls , utility bills , special taxes on gasoline and airline tickets , or other user fees . Since everyone depends on a strong infrastructure , a portion of the cost to maintain it comes from general tax revenues . While some needs are being funded already through Federal , state , and local programs and user fees , the current poor condition of the infrastructure indicates that investment levels are clearly inadequate . Through the years , the Federal government has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the states . However , voters have been reluctant to support new taxes or bond issues to build desperately needed community schools or water treatment plants . While many infrastructure problems stem from limited funding at all levels of government , several other factors are involved . As a society , the nation continues merely to patch up outdated and fragmented transportation systems instead of investing in innovative technologies , establishing better links between traditional transportation and mass transit , and encouraging new behaviors . It also focuses efforts on " end-of-thepipe " solutions-cleaning up the hazardous waste after it has contaminated the environment-instead of reducing it at the source . To help address some of these issues , the ASCE 's research arm , the Civil Engineering Research Foundation , has developed a partnership among industry , government , and the academic community . The Partnership for the Advancement of Infrastructure and Its Renewal is designed to foster and move research innovations into practice , as well as produce longer-lasting solutions to America 's infrastructure crisis . The following are among the problems that must be addressed : ROADS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased dramatically in the past 10 years , the U.S. has been seriously underinvesting in needed road and bridge repairs , even failing to maintain the substandard conditions currently existing . This is a dangerous trend that is affecting highway safety as well as the health of the economy . Road conditions . More than half of America 's urban and rural roadways ( 59% ) are in poor , mediocre , or fair condition , reports the Federal Highway Administration ( FHwA ) . Although this is a slight improvement from previous years , conditions remain at substandard levels . The FHwA ranks " poor " those roads in need of immediate improvement . " Mediocre " roads need improvement in the near future to preserve usability ; " fair " will likely need improvement ; " good " are in decent condition and will not require improvement in the near future ; and " very good " have new or almost new pavement . Photograph More than 240,000 miles of U.S highways , such as this heavily traveled road in north ern New Jersey , are pockmarked with cracks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridges are rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete . // Road performance . Substandard road and bridge design , pavement conditions , and outdated safety features are a factor in 30% of all fatal highway accidents , according to the FHwA . Personal and commercial highway travel Continues to increase at a faster rate than highway capacity , and the nation 's roads can not sufficiently support current or projected travel needs . Between 1970 and 1995 , passenger travel nearly doubled in the U.S. , and road use is expected to increase by nearly two-thirds in the next 20 years . Growth can be attributed to changes in the labor force , income , makeup of metropolitan areas , and other factors . More than 70% of peak-hour traffic occurs in congested conditions . The cost to the economy-in wasted time and fuel-in just the 10 most congested urban areas is $34,000,000,000 each year . In addition , poor highway conditions hinder effective transport of goods that help support the American economy . The investment needed merely to maintain current conditions is $263,700,000,000 over the next five years . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a five-year total of $357,500,000,000 in needs , according to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials . Bridge conditions . Of the nation 's 581,862 bridges , 182,726 ( 31.4% ) are rated structurally deficient or functionally obsolete by the FHwA . A structurally deficient bridge is closed or restricted to light vehicles because of its deteriorated structural components . While not necessarily unsafe , these bridges must have limits for speed and weight . A functionally obsolete bridge has older design features and , while not unsafe for all vehicles , can not safely accommodate current traffic volumes and vehicle sizes and weights . It will require $80,000,000,000 to eliminate the backlog of bridge deficiencies and maintain repair levels , according to the FHwA . Solutions . Easing the increasing demands on the nation 's transportation system and improving highway conditions , capacity , and safety are multifaceted tasks and are not restricted to building more roads and bridges . America must change its transportation behavior , increase investment at all levels of government , and make use of the latest technology . Cities and communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for errands and work commuting , and businesses must encourage more flexible schedules and telecommuting . Other solutions include private-public partnerships ( where appropriate ) and multi-year capital and operating budgets . Congress made great strides in meeting transportation funding needs in 1998 . It passed the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century , which provided $100,000,000,000 for maintenance and road repairs and S73,000,000,000 for new road construction over the next six years . Another $2,000,000,000 will go toward highway safety programs . Congress also ensured that all the money that is funneled into the Highway Trust Fund from gasoline taxes will be used exclusively for transportation improvements . Still , this funding is not enough to rescue the crumbling transportation network . Full repair of the nation 's roads and bridges requires $437,000,000,000 . MASS TRANSIT While investment has improved the level of transit service and some conditions in bus facilities and rail infrastructure , this has come at the expense of other categories in mass transit . There remains a significant backlog of overage buses and rail vehicles . In addition , the costs to comply with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pose a new financial burden on transit providers . If the nation fails to invest adequately in transit , the level of service will suffer . This can lead to increased traffic congestion and air pollution and can impair the nation 's " welfare-to-work " efforts since many low-income groups depend on public transportation to get to jobs . Condition and performance . The level of transit service rose from 1985 to 1995 . More cities are served by rail transit , and bus service has been extended to outlying suburban areas as well as smaller urbanized areas . In addition , the number of rail and other vehicles has increased to keep up with the service growth . Also during this time , several U.S. cities-Baltimore , Md. ; Buffalo , N.Y ; Denver , Colo. ; Los Angeles , Sacramento , San Diego , and San Jose , Calif. ; Portland , Ore. ; and St. Louis , Mo. - opened modern light-rail service . That produced a large addition to ridership in this transit category , but much of it is due to light-rail replacing major bus routes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all buses and 23% of rail vehicles are in deficient condition , as are 38% of rural and specialized vehicles . Twenty-one percent of rail track requires improvement to reach good condition . Investments have improved conditions at rail maintenance facilities and yards , yet nearly 48% of buildings and 65% of yards remain in fair to poor shape . Investment in bus maintenance facilities has covered half the cost to maintain condition . Signals and communication equipment conditions deteriorated from 28% in fair to poor condition in 1984 to 46% in 1993 . The investment needed just to maintain the transit system 's current condition and performance is $7,900,000,000 annually over the next five years , according to the U.S. Department of Transportation and the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) . It would take between $12,900,000,000 and $14,500,000,000 annually to maintain and improve conditions and performance-a need of about $72,000,000,000 over the next five years . Federal , state , and local investment averaged just $5,400,000,000 annually in recent years . Operating deficits will grow from $1,800,000,000 in 1996 to $4,500,000,000 in 2002 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , AASHTO predicts . Despite this trend , Federal support for operating assistance dropped 44% in 1996 , from $710,000,000 to $400,000,000 , shifting the funding burden to the states . With these added operating expenses and capital investment and without Federal assistance , the funding shortfall may require a doubling of transit fares . Funding shortfalls and other problems have caused some cities to delay or halt rail expansion . In Los Angeles , for example , the Metropolitan Transit Authority is looking at putting its $8,400,000,000 congestion-relieving rail construction program on hold to close a projected $727,000,000 deficit over the next six years . The $804,000,000 , 13.7mile Pasadena to Los Angeles light-rail line , which is more than 15% complete , would be the most immediately affected . Rail is a vital part of the solution to Los Angeles ' growing congestion and air pollution . Solutions . Through the Transportation Efficiency Act for the 21st Century , Congress provided $42,000,000,000 for mass transit programs , including the design and construction of 96 rail projects . The funding , though , is $30,000,000,000 short of what is needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where appropriate , but , in most cases , mass transit systems must be subsidized to maintain a relatively low cost to the consumer . AVIATION Although the U.S. aviation system is in fair shape today , it faces extreme peril in the near future without reorganization of the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) and rising investment in airport facilities and air traffic technology . Increasing air travel threatens to cripple the system if it is not significantly updated and expanded . This can endanger the economy , impact on Americans ' personal safety and travel time , and translate into higher ticket prices . Conditions . Passenger enplanements in the U.S. are expected to climb 3.9% annually from 546,200,000 in 1997 to 827,100,000 in 2008 , the FAA forecasts . At current capacity , this added air traffic will lead to gridlock as early as 2004 or 2005 , according to a report by the National Civil Aviation Review Commission ( NCARC ) . The U.S. would need 10 new airports the size of Chicago 's O'Hare to meet these capacity demands , suggests the Airport Council International , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin Avenue shuttle , which connects two branches of the city 's subway . The shuttle had become the most rundown link in the nation 's largest mass transit system , with pieces literally falling from elevated parts of the track // The number of aircraft delays of 15 minutes or more was 18.9% higher in 1996 than in 1995 , and the delays appear to be getting longer , the NCARC indicates . The FAA says there are 22 airports that are seriously congested , and that this number will rise to 32 in less than 10 years with the current investment rate . Airline delays in 1995 cost the industry about $2,500,000,000 in higher operating costs , the FAA estimates . This raises ticket rates and draws funds from needed investment in updated air traffic control systems . The NCARC also has warned that there will be a large airliner accident every seven to 10 days by the year 2010 if air travel increases and the airline accident rate remains at current levels , which , although low , has not improved in 30 years . The American Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America have assessed the investment need at $60,000,000,000 for airport development and reconstruction over the next five years . The FAA has placed the cost at $32,700,000,000 during the next four years . Solutions . Airport funding from the aviation trust fund ( airline ticket taxes ) , passenger facility charges , airport bonds , and state/local grants reached $7,060,000,000 in 1996 . However , the burden of funding has shifted away from Federal grants to increased passenger facility charges and bonds in recent years . The NCARC recommended an overhaul of the FANs budget , organization , and management to help improve airport facilities and safety , including freeing the agency from the Federal discretionary budget by directly funneling money from aviation user fees to the FAA . This allows funding to be driven by actual demand . The commission also called for cost-based user charges , increased investment in air traffic control modernization , the use of more state-of-the-art technology , transforming the FAA into a performance-based organization , and increased Federal funding through the Airport Improvement Program ( AIP ) . Another solution is to model the AIP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network and a second , more broad network of airports which has significant national interest , much like the Interstate Highway System and the National Highway System . This would help focus funding on priority projects and improve U.S. economic competitiveness , the Congressional Research Service notes . DRINKING WATER Drinking water quality has improved in many communities since the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1986 . Nevertheless , insufficient investment in updated distribution and treatment systems as well as inadequate efforts to protect surface and groundwater sources continue to pose a public health risk . Conditions . Every year , 7,000,000 cases of mild to moderate water-related illness occur in the U.S. , resulting in 1,200 deaths . In 1993 , the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) reported that more than 16,000 community systems ( 29% ) were out of compliance with the Safe Drinking Water Act . That same year , 100 people died and 400,000 were sickened in Milwaukee , Wis. , when the city 's water supply was contaminated by Cryptosporidium , a filtration- and chlorine-resistant microbe found in the digestive systems of livestock and wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About 47,000,000 Americans , one-fifth of the population , drink tap water with more than the EPA-approved level of microorganisms . During the 1990s , more than 10,000,000 people nationwide have been ordered to boil drinking water to kill disease-causing microorganisms . These episodes are frightening and costly . A four-day boil-water alert in Washington , D.C. , in 1993 cost the city an estimated $24,000,000 . Milwaukee 's tragedy was a wake-up call that resulted in an $89,000,000 program to protect its water better . Although the stakes are high , most state and local agencies still face financial and political obstacles to supplying safe drinking water . The total infrastructure investment needed remains large-$138,400,000,000 , according to the EPA . More than $76,800,000,000 is for infrastructure improvements required immediately to protect public health . These include projects for source protection , storage , treatment , and water main improvements necessary to minimize the risk of contamination of water supplies . The remaining $61,600,000,000 is for replacing existing infrastructure to provide safe drinking water through 2014 . A portion of this need is to meet proposed regulations . The nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **26;583;TOOLONG over 20 years for their installation and rehabilitation . These systems are vital to protect the public from contaminants that cause illness . The greatest need in this category is to replace existing pipelines . The U.S. has an estimated 800,000 miles of pipes . Some are wooden and have been in service for more than 100 years ; others are lined with lead , which can leach into the water . Many have exceeded their service life and are prone to breaks and leaks . Breaks in water mains occur in one of every 3.5 miles of pipe , the American Water Works Association points out . Water treatment needs for installation , upgrading , or replacement are $36,200,000,000 over the next 20 years . More than half ( $20,200,000,000 ) is to minimize the risk of contaminants . Water storage facility requirements are $ 12,900,000,000 for the next two decades to maintain structural integrity to prevent contamination . The 20-year need for water source rehabilitation and development is $11,000,000,000 to ensure the quality and quantity of drinking water . The remaining $1,900,000,000 covers seismic protection , automation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90% of the nation 's 55,000 community water systems and serve 3,300 people each on average . The total funding for these systems would be $37,200,000,000 , or 27% of the U.S. 's total needs . Customers of these systems face the greatest burden because the per-household cost is much higher to meet minimum water quality standards . In some communities , individual water bills are going up $100-300 per year to pay for system improvements . Solutions . Through 1996 amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Act , Congress authorized state revolving loan funds ( SRFs ) that help communities finance improvements . This allowed the EPA to focus regulatory efforts on those contaminants that pose the greatest public health risks , eased compliance standards for smaller systems , and permitted communities to utilize funds for water source protection . Congress also expanded requirements to notify water supply customers about contaminants . Photograph City Tunnel No. 3 , the largest capital construction project in New York City 's history , is expected to be completed in 2020 at a cost of about $6,000,000,000 . The 60-mile tunnel will deliver drinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // These reforms helped put safe drinking water efforts back on track . More Federal grants are needed , though , especially for smaller water systems to cope with the cost of compliance . In some cases , private-sector involvement in the drinking water industry may be appropriate to help lower costs and increase efficiency . Another way to cut water supply expenses is to reduce water consumption since it costs more to provide safe drinking water when the source becomes contaminated . The Federal FY 1999 budget raised funding levels for drinking water SRFs from $50,000,000 to $775,000,000 , but states and municipal water systems still must find the additional funding required to meet new standards . DAMS Millions of Americans rely on dams for water supply , power generation , flood control , irrigation , and recreation . Many of these structures are beyond their life span and are in desperate need of repair . Despite efforts by states to improve conditions , far too many unsafe dams remain at risk of failure , threatening life and property . Conditions . An alarming number of dams across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Downstream development is increasing . Most older dams were built without adequate spillways to release water in heavy rains , which causes it to run over the top . Inadequate spillway capacities are the most common deficiency and a major cause of dam failures . Safety officials estimate that thousands of dams are at risk of failing or are disasters waiting to happen . One-fourth of all U.S. dams are more than 50 years old ; by 2020 , that figure is expected to increase to 85% . Dam failures affect thousands of lives and cost millions of dollars . In the past 10 years , there have been more than 200 documented failures across the nation that caused millions of dollars in property damage and repair costs . Property damage from flooding runs more than $1,000,000,000 each year in the U.S. Approximately 9,200 regulated dams nationwide are considered to be highhazard , meaning that their failure likely will cause loss of life and substantial property damage . Even more significant are the 2,100 regulated dams considered to have deficiencies which leave them more susceptible to failure . Thirty-five percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1990 . Thousands of other dams are in need of rehabilitation to keep them from becoming unsafe . These repair projects are on hold because of a lack of funding . The 1995-96 National Inventory of Dams revealed that a majority of high- or significant-hazard dams do not have Emergency Action Plans in place that could mean the difference between timely downstream evacuation and disaster . Every state has at least one high-hazard dam . North Carolina , Pennsylvania , and Texas have more than 500 high-hazard dams each . North Carolina has the most-874 . Many dams built more than 50 years ago have been abandoned and the owners are unknown . They are not inventoried , inspected , or regulated , and no one is volunteering to pay for their repair . The average cost to restore each unsafe dam nationwide is approximately $500,000 . Using this figure , it would run more than $1,000,000,000 to rehabilitate all the documented unsafe dams in the U.S. Solutions . Regulation is essential to reduce hazards . That responsibility rests almost entirely with the states , which regulate about 95% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While the majority of states have been working to improve their programs in the last 20 years , most continue to struggle with minimal budgets and staff . A handful of states do n't even have adequate programs in place to regulate the safety of their dams . In order to help states improve dam safety programs , money is needed . One solution offered by the Association of State Dam Safety Officials to help the funding crisis is to establish state revolving funds , similar to the ones created under the Safe Drinking Water and Clean Water acts . SRFs are attractive and viable financing methods that could be used to help states address their needs . Based on each state 's need , Federal funds could be provided for the initial funding , or capitalization , to start a revolving fund . States would be required to provide a minimum of a 20% matching grant to the fund . Zero- or low-interest loans would be made by the state to help improve dam safety programs and activities .

WASTEWATER It has been more than a quarter-century since Congress enacted the first comprehensive national clean water legislation in 1972 in response to public outrage over the condition of America 's waterways . Back then , many of the nation 's rivers were little more than open sewers . Dead fish were being washed ashore by the thousands , wetlands were disappearing at a rapid rate , and rivers like the Cuyahoga in Cleveland were burning . While water quality has improved greatly , there remains a long way to go to reach acceptable levels . Photograph Bacterial treatment tanks in Arlington , Va. , remove sewage wastes , after which the newly clean water empties into the Potomac River . The fishermen in the boat directly behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass are abundant in that part of the river . // Conditions . Nearly 60% of America 's rivers , lakes , and streams are safe for swimming and fishing , compared to 40% in 1972 . Clearly , Federal legislation and infrastructure funding have helped halt environmental degradation , but there is still much more work to be done . Lands that supply groundwater are being paved over at alarming rates . Underground water supplies are being tapped out , and some already have been lost . Hundreds of municipal wells have been closed because of groundwater contamination . Much of the infrastructure put in place over the past several decades requires repair , replacement , or expansion . Significant funding will be needed soon to rehabilitate and replace existing wastewater treatment facilities . The EPA has estimated the investment necessary for wastewater systems at roughly $140,000,000,000 over the next 20 years , including $44,000,000,000 for wastewater treatment ; $10,000,000,000 for upgrading existing wastewater collection systems ; $22,000,000,000 for new sewer construction ; and $45,000,000,000 for controlling sewer overflows . Two thousand additional plants could be necessary by 2016 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contaminated groundwater sites in the U.S. run as high as 400,000 . Cleaning them up may cost as much as one trillion dollars over the next 30 years . In addition , the needs of small communities are significant since most lack the basic infrastructure to address water quality needs as well as the resources to document their existing problems adequately . The EPA estimates that the documented needs for communities with populations of less than 10,000 come to $13,800,000,000 . There are about 7,100,000 rural households without clean and/or safe drinking water or which are being served by community facilities that do n't meet safe drinking water standards , according to a Rural Utilities Service survey . Virginia alone has nearly $5,000,000,000 worth of water and sewer needs that should be addressed by 2005 . The leading cause of more than half the water quality problems is uncontrolled nonpoint sources , such as runoff from farms , cities , and other diffuse areas like construction , forestry , and mining . Equally troubling are the water-related illnesses that continue to confront municipalities nationwide . Every year , 7,000,000 cases occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congress is due to reauthorize the Clean Water Act in 1999 . Issues impacting the nation 's surface and groundwater must receive priority attention if public health , ecological , and commercial objectives are to be met . A nationally coordinated effort is required to improve the management of U.S. wastewater resources . Watershed management of non-point-source pollution and point-source stormwater must be approached with the same vigor and resources as pointsource wastewater . The cost to meet Federal water quality regulations has become a central issue in the last decade for many states and localities , as Federal funding shifted to state revolving funds to help them finance capital infrastructure projects . With $140,000,000,000 in wastewater needs over the next two decades , there is no question that a continued Federal role is necessary . SOLID WASTE Despite increased efforts to recycle and reduce the amount of waste the nation generates , Americans produce millions of tons of non-hazardous solid waste , and the amount is expected to increase . States and municipalities are running out of room to put waste , and communities continue to oppose landfill sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groundwater contamination remains a significant issue . Conditions . The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of the 1970s laid out a basic framework for regulating waste generators , transporters , and management facilities . The act broadly defines solid waste as hazardous and non-hazardous garbage , trash , and other discarded materials , whether solid , liquid , or contained gas . The EPA estimates that the U.S. generates roughly 13,000,000,000 tons of solid waste annually , including 200,000,000 of non-hazardous municipal solid waste requiring some type of processing by recycling , incineration , or disposal . The 208,000,000 tons of non-hazardous municipal solid waste generated in 1995 reflected a decrease of more than 1,000,000 tons from 1994 . For the first time , the per capita generation rate of municipal solid waste is projected to decrease from the current 4.4 pounds per person per day to 4.3 by the end of the century . Even with significant source reduction efforts , total annual municipal solid waste generated will increase to 218,000,000 tons by 2000 . Photograph Landfill areas for the disposal of solid waste are nearly full in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ongoing search to find other states or even foreign countries willing to accept payment to take the garbage , shipping it there in barges , trucks , and freight trains . // States and localities are responsible for solid waste disposal , and about 46 states have developed solid waste management programs . Localities increasingly have turned to recycling programs to manage waste . In the past five years , recycling and composting have been the fastest growing methods of waste management , accounting for 27% in 1995 , up from 10% in 1986 . There were over 7,000 curbside recycling programs in the U.S. in 1995 . Nearly 9,000 local governments have begun curbside collection of recyclable materials , and 3,300 have composting programs for yard waste . Landfilling will remain the predominant waste management method for the foreseeable future , even though the number of landfills has declined in recent years due to stringent environmental regulations and public opposition to new and expanding landfills . Local officials continually face the not-inmy-backyard syndrome , as residents oppose local landfill sites . Since 1984 , two-thirds of the nation 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightened . Many facilities have been replaced by waste-to-energy plants , which increased their capacity tenfold during the 1980s and now manage 16% of the nation 's municipal solid waste . According to the EPA , total expenditures for managing nonhazardous solid waste in 1972 were $8,400,000,000 . That rose to $18,000,000,000 in 1991 and is expected to reach $75,000,000,000 by 2000 . States and localities increasingly are concerned with the rising cost of solid waste management and diminishing disposal capacity . Solutions . While modern landfills are equipped with pollution control devices that minimize environmental damage , studies show extensive and continuing contamination of groundwater and inadequate training or funding for many state waste management programs still exist . Many communities use groundwater for drinking , and people living near contaminated sites understandably worry about the threat to their health . To address these problems , waste management strategies must focus on reducing the amount of waste generated ( source reduction ) , then recycling and reuse , and finally incineration . Several obstacles inhibit source reduction . Many purchases are strictly market- or convenience-driven , with little incentive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product or its packaging on the environment . The increased environmental and economic cost of disposing of municipal solid waste often makes it ultimately less expensive to reduce the materials at the source . Many more products could be redesigned and packaged in ways that would reduce the waste generated . Greater efforts must be made to provide incentives to redesign packaging and to modify the manufacturing process to reduce waste and encourage reuse . HAZARDOUS WASTE More than 530,000,000 tons of the municipal and industrial wastes generated in the U.S. each year are classified as hazardous to health or the environment . Industry contributes more than half of this waste . Progress in regulating and cleaning up hazardous waste facilities has become slower and more costly since the Comprehensive Environmental Response , Compensation and Liability Act , better known as Superfund , was enacted in 1980 . In recent years , it has become clear than the cost of cleaning up environmental contamination will be much higher than anyone expected . The price tag for Superfund and the related cleanup programs is an estimated $750,000,000,000 and could easily reach one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The breadth and depth of the Superfund program have expanded far beyond all expectations . In 1980 , the Environmental Protection Agency identified approximately 8,000 locations nationwide as hazardous waste sites to be considered for cleanup . By 1992 , that number had grown to nearly 37,000 . In 1982 , when the EPA first published its National Priorities List ( NPL ) of sites deemed serious enough to be candidates for Federally funded cleanup under Superfund , it included 418 sites . Today , there are about 1,200 sites on the NPL , and the EPA expects the number to grow to more than 2,000 in the next several years . While progress has been made in cleaning up NPL sites , the actual number deleted from the NPL remains small ; just 423 ( 32% ) have been removed to the Construction Completed List . Construction work remains at approximately 800 NPL sites . In addition , the average cleanup cost per site is much higher than first anticipated . The original estimated average site cleanup cost of $7,000,000 has risen to about $30,000,000 . In the past , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from excise taxes on petroleum and certain chemicals , as well as a broad-based environmental tax on corporations , but these expired on Dec. 31 , 1995 . The Congressional Budget Office estimates that there is enough money in the trust fund to pay for the program through 2000 . The Superfund trust fund has contributed $16,500,000,000 toward cleanup since 1980 . Photograph Hazardous wastes are stored in heavyweight packaging in a Philadelphia facility , awaiting shipment to a recycling plant or to a location where they can be safely buried or incinerated . // Reports by the General Accounting Office show that the time required to complete hazardous waste cleanups increased from 2.3 years in 1986 to 11.5 in 1997 . In addition , the average time taken to evaluate hazardous waste sites for inclusion on the NPL grew from about four years in 1986 to 9.4 in 1996 . Under Federal law , the EPA is required to evaluate non-Federal sites for listing within four years of their discovery . Using these figures , it takes roughly 20 years to clean up a site from start to finish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disputes over how to clean up sites , who should pay the tab , and how to remedy damage done by Superfund sites to rivers , streams , and other natural resources . Superfund 's taxing authority must be renewed for the trust fund to remain solvent and cleanups to continue at a steady pace . Escalating cleanup costs combined with limited resources demand that funds be allocated where they are likely to have the greatest impact in reducing threats to human health and the environment . The liability structure of the Superfund program has resulted in excess legal and transaction costs and significantly has reduced the application of funds to engineering and construction efforts . It unfairly burdens design professionals and contractors who become involved in site analysis and remediation activities . Reauthorization legislation should provide liability relief for engineers and contractors who work in good-faith efforts to restore Superfund sites , as well as absolving parties from liability for activities that were legal before enactment of the law . SCHOOLS In recent years , there has been widespread public concern over the physical condition of America 's school facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary schools are in substandard condition and need major repairs due to leaking roofs , plumbing problems , inadequate heating , or other system failures . Conditions . More than 14,000,000 children are being taught in school buildings needing significant repairs to restore them to good overall condition . The most recent report , conducted in 1996 by the General Accounting Office , on the condition of the nation 's schools found that one-third need extensive repair or replacement . In addition , the report found that nearly 60% of schools have at least one major building feature in disrepair , such as leaky roofs or crumbling walls ; more than half have unsatisfactory environmental conditions , such as poor ventilation , heating or lighting problems , or poor physical security ; and 46% lack even the basic electrical wiring to support computers , modems , and modem communications technology . It will cost about $112,000,000,000 to repair , renovate , and modernize U.S. school facilities . This includes $65,000,000,000 required by the one-third of school districts that have one or more entire buildings in need of major repairs or replacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40% ) reported needing about $36,000,000,000around $1,200,000 per school-to replace or repair building features , such as the plumbing or roof . About two-thirds will have to spend $11,000,000,000 to meet Federal mandates , approximately $5,000,000,000 of which is needed to fix or remove hazardous substances , such as asbestos , lead , and radon . Total annual construction and renovation spending since 1991 has remained between $10,000,000,000 and $12,000,000,000 for K-12 schools . School facility problems vary and tend to be heavily concentrated in the inner cities . Reports show that 38% of central city schools had at least one inadequate building , compared to 29% in suburbs and large towns and 30% in small towns and rural schools . This is largely because inner cities must spend disproportionate sums to meet the special needs of poor and immigrant students , and thus often forgo construction spending . In addition to repairing existing structures , the nation needs to build 6,000 new schools at a cost of $60,000,000,000 to accommodate the 3,000,000 children who will be added to the rolls in the next 10 years . Today , cities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ libraries , bathrooms , and trailers as makeshift classrooms . Solutions . Despite demand for upgraded and expanded facilities , state and local governments are cutting school budgets , leaving less for new construction and deferring necessary maintenance and repair . Many communities have been reluctant to pass local bond issues because they feel enough money already is being spent on schools . A study by the National School Boards Association found nearly one-fourth of proposed bond issues or tax increases failed in the five years prior to 1995 in the 85 school districts surveyed . The Clinton Administration 's Fiscal Year 1999 budget request called for Federal tax credits to pay interest on nearly $22,000,000,000 in bonds to repair schools . This measure was defeated for 1999 , but likely will be part of the FY 2000 budget debate . Governments should explore alternative financing , including lease financing , where the facility is privately owned , and publicprivate partnerships that can provide a combination of financing/ownership/use arrangements to facilitate construction .
