Most people believe that Black folks do n't suffer from eating disorders . That it 's a white thing . But the truth is that a growing number of Black women are living in the secret and dangerous worlds of anorexia and bulimia . It was Thanksgiving and I had come to the East Coast for the holidays . In the past I had always loved Thanksgiving meals , but this particular evening the smell of turkey roasting , candied yams bubbling in pools of butter and brown sugar and pumpkin pie baking into golden-brown buttery crust filled me with terror . Fat was lurking everywhere . I tried not to inhale too deeply , because I felt certain that even smells this rich would be enough to put cellulite on my thighs . Stepping from the shower , I proudly surveyed the slender dancer 's body I had worked so hard to create . Just a little more to lose . As I dressed for dinner , I imagined each item that was to be served as a small pile of lard . At the dinner table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to pick at my plate . By the time he had finished seconds , I had scarcely eaten one third of my food . When he returned with his second helping , Kevin brought a piece of pumpkin pie for me . I could n't resist . One bite of the pie , and before I knew it the entire slice had disappeared , along with the rest of the food on my plate . I excused myself and headed for the small bathroom on the first floor where I would not be discovered . I locked the bathroom door behind me , then bent over the toilet bowl , stuck my index finger down my throat and gagged repeatedly . In exact reverse of the order I had consumed them , the turkey , stuffing , yams , pie , cranberry sauce and string beans came up . Finally there was nothing left but bitter green bile . With a feeling of relief and accomplishment , I flushed the toilet and turned to the sink to wash my hands , splash cold water on my face and rinse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror , I told myself , Everything is under control . I remember thinking then that I would never need to throw up again . I could stop myself whenever I wanted to . I had been suffering from anorexia with intermittent episodes of bulimia for almost two years . Because I was a dancer , people expected me to be thin , and because I am Black , no one suspected an eating disorder . The myth that Black culture protects Black women from all eating disorders except obesity is still prevalent within the medical community . And most people believe that bulimia and anorexia are white people 's problems . However , the scary reality is that this silence and ignorance are masking a very serious problem . Though only a few studies have explored women of color and eating disorders ( white women have been the subject of hundreds of studies ) , experts confirm that the incidences of both anorexia and bulimia are on the rise in our community . The consequences are grave : The longer an eating disorder remains untreated , the more potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metabolic rates , dental problems , nervous-system dysfunction , chronic fatigue , depression , kidney trouble , cardiac arrhythmias and tearing of the esophagus . Anorexics may suffer from bone abnormalities , hypotension and heart palpitations or arrhythmias . The death rate among anorexics is higher than average , sometimes due to suicide . With illness and death on the line , it 's imperative that we all learn more about eating disorders and how they affect our community . THE FACTS ABOUT EATING DISORDERS Shana ( her name and others have been changed ) , an actress and model , is beautiful and slender and suffers from both anorexia and bulimia . Her face has graced the covers of a number of national magazines . She worries about her weight constantly , knowing that her career depends on how she looks  --  especially because she is a Black actress , and there are so few roles available . Not long ago she was watching her weight because she had a movie coming up , but she could n't get out of a dinner invitation  --  a seven-course French meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bathroom , " Shana recalls . " One course comes up quite quickly , and it does n't make my face red the way throwing up a whole meal does . " Shana continues , " At any rate , the film was a smash , and I 've been working steadily ever since . The problem is , I have to go to a lot of business dinners . Now two , three , four times a week I find myself compelled to throw up my dinner . " Like Shana , millions of people severely limit the amount of food they eat or purge themselves by vomiting or using laxatives . Most properly diagnosed sufferers are young white middle-class women , although men and women of other races and ages also have the problem  --  and their numbers may be rising . The National Association of Anorexia and Associated Disorders estimates that 8 million Americans , primarily women , suffer from eating disorders . According to Loretta DiPietro , Ph.D. , assistant professor of epidemiology at Yale University 's Department of Epidemiology and Public Health , the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies . She believes the true number falls somewhere between 10 and 60 percent , although a study of college-age women noted that 90 percent had reported bulimic behavior . Anorexia is rarer , but most experts acknowledge that estimates of anorexics may be artificially low because documented cases are predominantly inpatient-treatment cases , women whose problem is so severe that they are on the brink of death . Due to a lack of research , no one knows how many Black women suffer from either condition . The late Hilde Bruch , Ph.D. , author of The Golden Cage : The Enigma of Anorexia Nervosa , defined anorexia as " the relentless pursuit of thinness . " Adds Janet David , Ph.D. , who treats many women with eating disorders in her clinical practice in New York , " Anorexics have a certain inflexible and absolute attitude about the necessity of weight loss . Despite being weak , sick and emaciated enough to look like concentration-camp victims , anorexics continue to insist that they are fat . " Bulimics are somewhat different . They tend to be of normal weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , they may go on secret eating binges , then try to lose the weight by vomiting or using laxatives , diet pills or diuretics . Others do n't purge , but follow a strict diet , fast or do vigorous exercise . Katie , a 25-year-old former Wall Street analyst , found herself combining various methods of " controlling " her weight . " In college I stayed thin by working out constantly . I 'd usually start my day with a six-to-ten-mile run and end it with an aerobics class . Unfortunately , on Wall Street I sometimes worked more than 100 hours a week , so I did n't have that kind of time . I 'd usually take an hour to work out at the health club across the street , but that was n't enough . " About four months after I started working I began having difficulties . Working late , the analysts at my firm would order in food . I noticed my clothes getting tighter . I bought a scale , and sure enough , I 'd gained ten pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something quick that would n't make me look funny . Throwing up at work was out of the question . People would notice . I began taking lots of laxatives . I was up to about a package of Ex-Lax after each meal . " My work began to suffer . I made several large mistakes in my calculations for a major deal . I was fired . Sometimes I think it 's the best thing that ever happened to me . " According to Andres Pumariega , M.D. , professor of neuropsychiatric and behavioral sciences at the University of South Carolina School of Medicine , Black women are less likely to be anorexic and more likely to engage in bulimic behavior like Katie 's . " Some of the key characteristics of anorexia are self-denial and avoidance of pleasurable and sensual experiences , " he explains . " In some ways , these are not native to African culture . " Experts have also found a frightening link between bulimia and dieting  --  perhaps an important factor in eating disorders among African-American women : A disproportionate number of us are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most of the cases of bulimia she has studied , severe dieting and anorexia both directly preceded the onset of bulimia . Because diets are seldom successful , women who continue to diet may enter a spiral where each dietary failure reduces self-esteem , increases depression and increases susceptibility to overeating . At the extreme , this spiral may promote anorexia nervosa and especially bulimia . WOMEN WHO ARE AT RISK Women with eating disorders generally have qualities that are valued and rewarded by society . They are highly motivated , intelligent , disciplined , goal-oriented and perfectionistic . However , they all share a dearth of self-esteem that expresses itself as dissatisfaction with their bodies . The problem is exacerbated by our society 's relentless worship of thinness . Bombarded with magazine covers , billboards , TV commercials and movies celebrating thinness and beauty may wreak havoc on the mind of a woman whose self-esteem is already low . Women are more likely than men to be victims of eating disorders because we are most harshly judged by unrealistic standards of size and beauty . Adolescent girls and young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world are at the highest risk . Adolescent girls may also be afraid of their budding sexuality . Being extremely thin may be a way for such a girl to retain a little girl 's body . Anorexics and bulimics are often highly controlled women who seem to have it all together . But in our male-dominated society , women are not in control , and some become extremely frustrated . Mastering their bodies and food intake may be one way , albeit distorted , to exercise control . For Black women , some of these problems may be extremely acute . According to Maria P. Root , author of Bulimia : A Systems Approach , " Increased social , vocational and economic opportunities are available to women of color  --  particularly those who can operate n ways that conform to the dominant white culture 's norms . Women of color are under tremendous pressure as role models , many times feeling that they must be " perfect " in order to counteract negative racial stereotypes . " Katie , who is now in business school , knew that feeling very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a primary career goal . I was going to be the best Black female analyst those bastards on Wall Street had ever seen . In addition to doing impeccable work , I felt it was imperative that I look impeccable at all times That meant wearing a size four . " In tandem with feeling they need to be perfect , girls who are at risk often begin disordered eating during a family crisis , perhaps a divorce or marital conflict . They try hard to be perfect in the false hope that they can make the family problems go away and to find a measure of control . The high rate of divorce and the conflicts that may exist between Black men and women make young girls particularly vulnerable . Among whites , mainly middle-class women have eating disorders , and the same may be true in our community . The problem may be worse for Black women who live in predominantly white areas and go to predominantly white schools  --  women who live their lives outside the Black community , where large women are more readily accepted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Root , " an eating disorder may develop in a Black woman as a way to continue to ensure acceptance and cope with identity issues . " What 's more , the overpowering devaluation of African-American racial and ethnic identity  --  our physical features , foods , rituals , manners  --  by the dominant culture has long made us ashamed of who we are , how we behave and how we look . Some women go to extremes to fit in , feeling extremely ashamed of the ample hips and thighs that are the pride of our ancestors , and try to get rid of them . Says actress Shana , " You know as well as I do that film adds an extra 10 or 15 pounds , conservatively . I was cast as a dancer , not as an African dancer . " RECOGNIZING AND DEALING WITH THE PROBLEM Alta , a 41-year-old San Francisco social worker , is worried about Mhyrdis , her 24-year-old stepdaughter , who she suspects has an eating disorder . " She seems to hate me now , and she 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she 's so tiny . I 'm not sure how she got so small . She used to be very buxom and curvaceous . " I did notice things around her room from time to time . First No Doz and then diet pills . She eats all kinds of junk : soul food , ribs , big bags of chips . But she 'll never eat with the rest of the family . I 'm worried because my younger daughter watches her , and I 'm afraid of what she 's seeing . " Mhyrdis may have an eating disorder . Such disorders are hard to identify because of the secretive behavior , but here are some signs . For example , does the person : * Make repeated comments about being or feeling fat and ask , " Do you think I 'm fat ? " when her weight is below average . * Eat in secret , perhaps leaving food wrappers in her room , or sneak food ? * Eat only tiny portions ? * Compulsively overeat ? * Seem depressed ? * Vomit ( is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sink , shower or wastebasket ? ) or abuse laxatives , diuretics or diet pills ? * Complain of constipation or the absence of menstruation ? * Complains or show signs of lightheadedness , disequilibrium ( loss of balance ) or mood swings not accounted for by other know medical causes ? * Do purposeless , excessive physical activity that 's not a training regimen ? Anorexia and bulimia can be treated and cured . It is imperative that you recognize and deal with your own problem or that people like Alta and her stepdaughter confront the situation and get help  --  even if the confrontation is painful and difficult . The earlier a person in trouble receives proper medical and psychological help , the better her chances of full recovery . The person must have an accurate diagnosis by a professional trained in the areas of medicine , psychology and nutrition .
