 | Tinian Island , March 8 , 1945 " We are going to bring it to him , " the Colonel said with satisfaction . A lot , more than usual . " Fire . This is what you 've got to look forward to . This is what he 's got to look forward to . " He leaned into it , from the heels , you could say . I sat and waited , looking straight ahead . " We 're going to bring it to him . " He looked down the rows of us , but I did n't watch him do it ; all this was like before . " To the enemy , you know . Up yonder , friends . Up yonder to the north . " I le pointed at the ceiling , not north . " North and fire . " " Fire , " he said again . " We 're going to put him in it . That 's saying , friends , that we 're going to put fire around him , all around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . We 're going to bring it down on him and on to him .

White phosphorus , that 'll hold on . We 're going to put it in his dreams . Whatever heaven he 's  | hoping for , we 're fixing to make a hell out of it . Soon , good buddies . We just got the good word this morning . White phosphorus and napalm . That 's our good stuff for the little yellow man and his folks . We 're going to make him a present of it , in his main city . Bestow it . Give it away . With both hands . With three hundred airplanes . Tokyo is going to remember us . Within a week , I clue you . That 's all I can tell you right now . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ammunition . No gunners . All payload , all fire . " I sat up a little . Some of the other gunners were grinning at each other . This was a raid they could sit out , another day and a night they would live . I did n't feel that way , though . I could n't see any point in the pilots and the other crew going up amongst the fighters without any protection , and I did n't really want to sit out any raids playing Ping-Pong and watching Andy Hardy movies . No ammunition , no gunners . I wondered who had thought that up . " But we 're not there yet , " the Colonel said . " The firebomb strike is going to be gravy . It 's going to be history . But tonight is just regular , gunners and all . We rendezvous at angels nine , at sixteen three seven . Your course is three-five-six degrees true . The target is Tokyo . " I sat back . The mission would be like the others , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad the Colonel had quit talking about fire . That had nothing to do with me . We had a couple of hours , and most of us went back to the Quonset hut to check over personal equipment and do whatever we wanted . We had worked on the plane all morning , the  | crew and the armorers mainly , and it was ready , just as ready as it had been the other eight times . The armorers were good . They knew what they were doing , and I finished servicing my place in the tail before any of the others got through . I fieldstripped the twin fifties , but there was really no need to do it . The parts were all nearly brand new , and the springs to the belt-holding pawl and the belt-feed lever were as strong as if they had just come out of the machine at the factory . I made sure that the belts were straight in the boxes and would n't twist when they fed . That was all I needed to do , as far as regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any danger from my own equipment , unless I got excited or panicked and fired the guns too long , so that a shell cooked off in the chamber . That had happened in two or three of the other planes , and one gunner , a new guy , was killed . But I never felt like there was ever any possibility of that in my plane , at least not at my station back in the tail . When I was through with the guns , I checked the intercom jacks and the electrical outlet , and as far as the Air Force was concerned , I was ready to go . But I had one or two more things to do that were not regulation . When they brought the chest chutes in and stacked them , I waited until the riggers left and took some tire tape and taped one chute by the harness snap to the bulkhead ? I do n't like anything of mine to be loose . Then I soaped the inside of my plexiglass and cleaned it down good with a rag I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off at sixteen hundred , which is what the Air Force calls four o'clock in the afternoon , and I wanted to be able to see as much as I could . It would be night when we got up over Japan , and even though at night you fired most of the time at the flashes you saw the Nip fighters giving out with , there might be something I would be able to see ,  | somewhere along in there , and if that was so , I wanted to see it good . I was finished with everything , then , and sat looking through the plexiglass at the runway until the others got ready to go back . The hut was all right , at least for what it was , though they kept it too hot in there . The crews went over their stuff , the things they carried with them and on them , and talked about it , and I got ready to go over mine . The armorers and mechanics and riggers and the other enlisted men who were not air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be friendly and do what they could , but there was so much difference of feeling between them and us that any talk you heard or got into was so hard to be honest about , so hard to keep going , that it did n't seem to me like it was worth it . Some of the crews played cards with the others , and there was a lot of letter writing . If it had been me , I would n't have done it , because if you 've got your mind on somebody who 's not in the air with you , you 're giving something away , and you might not could get it back . I did n't know anybody back in the States or the territories , since my father died just before I went into the Air Force , and even if I knew people to write to , I would have kept them clear of what I was doing . I was sorry for the married fellows , and even sorrier for the ones who thought they wanted to get married . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were to a person who was out of it , and who wanted you out of it . I laid my personal equipment , or most of it , on the cot and started going over it , not because I had to or thought I should , but because I like to : liked the equipment , and the reasons I had got it together the way it was . They were all good reasons . An open-hay barracks bothers some people , who will tell you  | all about their privacy , and what it means to them , and all that , but you can be just as private as you want to anywhere you take a notion . The other crews let me alone , pretty much ; they knew how I was . Every now and then one of them would ask me something , and I 'd tell him what I thought . But they 'd been on the same missions ; they had their own ways of doing things . The new guys , though , the replacements , always wanted to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing over my bunk . Recruits were always coming around , these or others like them . Some I knew and some I did n't . I had never seen either one of these before . One was a pale , redheaded fellow who I judged had n't been out from the States very long . The other was taller , as rough looking as a placer miner . He had a snake tattooed on one forearm , with the sleeve pushed up on that one and not the other , and a hardscrabble beard , probably two or three days old . " You fixing to fly this mission ? " I asked him . " Yeah , " he said . " What 's that to you ? " " You better shave , then , " I told him , " while you got time . " " I 've already said it , and I 'll say it again . What 's that to you ? " " You been up before ? " " No , " said the redhead . " We both just got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . " " You 're going to be up there seven or eight hours , and at least part of the time you 'll be on the mask . It 'll fit better if you shave . If you do n't , your face will drive you crazy . The main thing is that if you 're on mask discipline , you ca n't get at your face and it can give you a bad time . " " I 'll do it or not do it , little man , " the tall one said . " I hive it your way , " I said , and went back to going over my stuff . But they would n't leave .  | " Take off , will you ? " I said . " I 've still got to count up and check off . " " You say you 're gon na jack off ? " And when I did n't look up , he went on . " If I 've got time to shave , you can do that . You 're giving me free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shifting from one leg to the other . I packed the fishhooks and twine into my emergency kit . " You the big Nip knocker around here ? " " My name is Muldrow . You do n't need to know any more than that . " " Four kills . That right ? " " Seven . " " The board says four . " " Go read the board , then . " " Does it bother you to kill people ? " " No , " I said . " That 's what I 'm here for . " Then , " What business is that of yours ? " " Do n't fool with him , Arlen , " the redhead said , looking back and forth between us . " Do n't fool with him . The other guys told us that just as soon as we got in . Do n't fool with this one . " " This little prick ? " the tall one said . " He do n't have his guns now . I could bust his back with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunk . " He 's right , " I said . " You better listen to him . Do n't give me any trouble . You might lose that snake , and that would be too bad . Your mama might want it . " He leaned over , and I organized , bunching . " Do you like money ? " I asked him . He was n't sure . He did n't know where I was taking him . " Yeah , " he said finally . " Yeah . I like money . " " You got any ? "  | He felt around . " Some , " he said . " Twenty ? " " Yeah . I got twenty . " " I 'll bet you fifty against twenty that I 'm stronger than you are . " How 're you gon na tell ? " " I can tell right quick . It 's just something we take on , you and me . We both try to do it , but you ca n't do it and I can . That 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you little shit . " " Maybe , but I would n't try that either . You 're missing the point , mama 's boy . Let 's see if you 've got any guts . Let 's see if that snake can give you what you ai n't got . " " Try me , " he said . " You see that brace right over your head ? That long two-by-four ? " He looked up . " I see it . " " Jump up and grab it . Chin on it . " " I can do twenty . " " One is enough . " He got off the floor , and I must say that he looked good doing it ; he might have been a basketball player . He chinned on the brace , and came down . " How 's that , asshole ? " " Average , " I said . " Now jump up and catch it like this . " I showed him : four fingers together , thumb opposite ? a pinch grip . " I ai n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . " Try it . " Ile jumped and caught the brace , but could n't hold . He tried hard but he fell , purple in the face . " No grip , " I said . " No grip , no guts . " That 's what they say . " He went an even deeper color , 7  | with veins and frustration . " Stand clear , " I said , and launched up from the bunk to the brace . I caught it pretty well with one hand and then adjusted . " You see where I am , " I said , keeping my voice down , down and level . I had quit swinging by this time . " Now watch . " I went up slow to the bar , holding the pinch with everything I had . Everything was in my fingers , thumbs , forearms , and wrists . My body had almost no weight , only strength , main strength . I went up a second time , a little faster , and then once more , slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped back , like a snake or a lynx had hit the floor between them . " Now , " I said , turning square into the tall one . " You want to shake hands ? " " You mean ... How do you mean ? " " Friendly or unfriendly . " " You think you can mash my hand ? " " Put it out there . " " No , " he said , " I do n't think I 'll try . You got me convinced . " He made a kind of smile , but I did n't answer . " With the grip you got , might not be too much left . " " Maybe a few bone splinters , " I told him . " I might could use those . You can sew with them , you know . " I waited a second . " I was raised up north . Some of my best friends are Eskimos . I could use a few needles out of your hand . I 'll put ' em in my emergency kit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He smiled again , with not much strength . " I think I 'll hold on to them , " he said . " I need them to fire the fifties . " " OK , then , " I said . " Pay me . " He had trouble getting out the twenty , but he gave it to me . I handed it back . " This is for using your head , " I said , " and for  | not making any more trouble . And for shaving before we take off . Go on , now , do what I tell you . " He left . The other boy , the redhead , stayed . " Can I ask you one thing , Sergeant Muldrow ? Just one ? " " I guess , " I said . " What is it ? " " I 've been assigned to your crew . Have you got anything special you can . . . clue me in on ? " " No , " I said . I looked at him finally . " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic . Make it count . That 's all . " " How about the crew ? " " Major Sorbo is a good pilot . He 's cool enough . He knows what to do . You 're lucky to be on with him . " " If you do n't mind me saying so , I 'm lucky to be on with you , too . I never have to ask anybody but once who the best gunner in the squadron is . The guys ? the Major and the rest of them ? you do n't fly with them , they fly with you . It 's a damned honor . I 'm flicked if it 's not . " " Well , " I said , " there 's not any reason to go on and on . I do n't do anything special . I just wait for what I want and then I center in and cut loose . So take your time . Be fast , but take your time . Know what I mean ? " " Not exactly , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do that , " I said . " I 'll see you later on , out on the truck . " " Just one more thing . How did you learn to do this ? How can you be all that sure ? " " I learned just like you did . Buckingham Field , Fort Myers , Florida . That where you went to gunnery ? Or Harlingen , maybe ? "  | " No . I was in Florida , too . At Tyndall . I just barely graduated . I come from Florida , too . " " Well , you got through , anyway . You 're here . Just do what they taught you in gunnery school . " " You mean you never shot a gun before you went to gunnery school ? " " I did n't say that , " I said , facing him a little more and looking at him , but not for long , because I do n't spend time on anything I ca n't use . " I was raised in Alaska , on the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , facing away from the States , and I could shoot as soon as I could hold a gun . " That was not quite true , though , and I set it straight . " No , I could do it before that . My father would prop the rifle up on a stump , and I 'd get down behind it and cut loose . " I would like to get back to that , I told myself before I could think about it . I was impatient , I guess . It could n't be too soon for me , to get down behind the twin fifties , like behind a rock , and cut loose when the time came , when it was time for it . I looked up from the Florida boy into the rest of the hut . The trouble with the whole damn place was that the people ? the gunners and the rest of the enlisted personnel ? were trying to make it look like somebody 's house , a home of some kind of person , when it could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were posters of different places in the States ? a lake , a field full of flowers , the buildings of some city or other ? and all over the hut were pictures of people , mainly women and children , little children , and mostly ugly , and even a Christmas card every now and then , over this guy 's bunk , up from me , and another one farther along . All that was strange , and wrong . The hut was nobody 's house . The people who were in it ought to have taken it like it was , and for what it was . There was no  | reason for Betty Grable to be up on the wall in a white bathing suit , with her fat ass in your face , looking over her shoulder . Not a one of those gunners , not a one , had any idea what the real feeling of a home is like , like it used to be when I came in off the snowshoes , when maybe I had n't brought anything back with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trap lines empty , too , and would just come in off the snow and look right straight into that red wall , the wall my father had painted , just for the color . There 's not much color on the Brooks Range , and you 're glad for a little while when you come back to your place , and before you go out into the snow again , where you belong . " They said you did n't talk much , " the Florida boy said . " Who told you that ? I do n't mind talking , I 'll tell you anything I know . " After a while he said , " All this do n't bother you ? " " No . And it ought not to bother you , either . You 've got a good pilot and a good crew . The airplane 's been checked out every which way . You got every chance in the world . Just get up there and do what you know . Get them Nip fighters on the pursuit curve , like they showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let ' em slide on down the string , lead ' em just like it feels is right , and cut loose on ' em . They 'll back off , or go down . If they do n't do neither one , keep on shooting . Keep the Nips off you with that fifty caliber and the Major will get you on back here . He 'll do it . And that 's a fact . " That seemed to be not too bad a thing to tell him , because he got friendly , or tried to get friendly , and sat down on the foot side of my hunk , running his eyes back and forth over what was there . I picked up my knife and the sharp-stone I used with it ,  | and put a touch or two to the blade , whether it needed me to or not . " What kind of knife is that ? " he asked after a while , like I knew he would . " Is it issue ? " " No , it 's not issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What kind is it , then ? " he asked . " It 's a bread knife , " I told him . " The only difference is that I brought the point on down real fine . The edge is good , too . Kitchen steel is good steel . As good as you can get . " He seemed not to understand , so I spelled it out for him . " Look , " I said , bending the knife almost double . The light from the roof bulb curved , wires and all , into the light of the blade . " That means it wo n't break off . It 's not like one of these stiff issue blades , like a bayonet or a commando knife , that ai n't got any give to it . This one will bend , it 'll go around . " " Go around what ? " " Go around something , say , like a rib . It 'll go around and come back . It 'll straighten out on the other side and keep on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mission ? Do you stick it in your flying suit ? " I looked at him . I looked at him and stood up . " No , " I said finally . " I put it in the case and strap it , or tape it , to my left hipbone , with the blade going down my leg . " " And you 're left-handed ? " " No , " I said again . " I 'm not left-handed . I pull the blade out across me . Cross-handed , you could call it . " He was not going to understand , so I went on . " That way , the handle is in your hand so that you can hold it lower than the blade and come up . " I showed him . " Come up with it . The other way , where you pull it out with your right hand , from  | your right side , the blade ends up higher than your hand , or level with it , and you have to come down when you use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . With a knife , you need to come up . " I showed him . " So I pull the knife in just two moves , to do what I want . Once across , and then up . " I waited and watched . " Up , and up hard . If it hits anything going in , the blade will just flex and go on around . " I put the knife back in the case . " And that 's what you want . " I was n't going to give him a chance to ask me what he wanted to ; I would n't have told him anyway . It was just something I had learned in Alaska . I sat back down and tried to get him interested in the other equipment . It was n't hard to do . I had a mixture of the same emergency stuff he had , along with some other things he did n't have . " What are these for ? " he asked , pointing . " Some kind of lucky stones ? From up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lucky on down the road . " I picked them up . " They 're flints . To make fire . " " Do n't you have matches in your emergency kit ? " " Sure , and I take ' em along , just like you . But there 're just so many of them . When they 're gone , you got no more fire . With the flints , you got all you want . " " Can I try ? Can I try them ? " he asked , like a little boy . " Sure , " I said . " You can try all you want . " I le did , and nothing sparked . " I low do you hit them together ? Is there a trick to it ? " " In a way , " I said . " It takes practice . A lot of years . Everybody in this barracks could knock these rocks together all night and there would n't be a single spark . If you needed fire , you would n't get it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | I did , and blew out the spark on the blanket . " There 's plenty of fire in the rocks , " I said . " All you want . It stays there . The rocks have kept it for a long time , just waiting for this blanket , in this barracks building . But I wo n't burn you up , " I said . " I promise . " " We got to go burn the Japs up , " he said , coming back to where we were , " in a couple of days . " " That 's right , " I told him . " Napalm and white phosphorus . That 's going to be our big play . Just like the Colonel said . " I grinned , myself . " But not tonight . Tonight is just routine . Tokyo one more time , with the frags and the two-thousand-pound GPs . Guns and gunners and all , right up there amongst the fighters . It 'll give you a chance to knock on ' em . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he came back . I could n't get rid of him . " Is this emergency equipment OK ? " he asked . " Sure , " I said . " If you know how to use it . " I took apart my kit . " You 've got a little knife . It 's not hardly more than a toy , but there are things you can do with it . You 've got fishhooks and some twine . You 've got matches in a packet that 's supposed to be waterproof . And you 've got a little , a real little , compass . Did n't you get briefed on all this ? " " I did , but I do n't remember much about it , to tell you the truth . " I held up the compass . " This is not a bad little compass , " I said . " You can hide it easy . You can even stick it up your asshole if , like , the situation comes up . " " I ca n't figure out what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxing , which was a relief . " You ca n't ever tell , " I said . " You just ca n't ever tell . "  | " Do you put the kit in your leg pocket ? " " No , I tape it right square onto me . " I hit my chest with my fingers . " I like to keep everything together . " " You sure use a lot of tape . " " I do , " I said . " I do n't like to have anything loose , where it might get away from me , or I might have to hunt for it . Hunt for it on the way down , like . " When I said down , he lost his relaxation , and even might have changed color a little ; that 'd be hard to tell under those kind of lights , though . " What would you do if you went down ? " " I do n't know . I 'd have to see when I got there . " " I do remember one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I came in . " He breathed a lot , and then did it again . " You ca n't expect any mercy from the Japs when you go down . " " No , you ca n't . But why should you get any ? This here 's a war , and we 're up there knocking their cities around . Ai n't no need to talk about mercy . They do n't have any . Especially for air crew . They cut off your head . Balls , too . Them first , most of the time . So do n't go down if you can help it . " When he did n't say anything , I changed gears . " Remember this : if you go down , it ai n't going to be your GI emergency kit that 'll save you . " " What will , then ? " I touched my head . " Whatever you can come up with that 's already in there . " I looked at him and propped up on my elbows . " There 's plenty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , that 's what you need . " " 1 do n't know if I 've got anything . . . anything like what you 're talking about . " " Sure you do . You ai n't got what I 've got , and I ai n't got what  | you 've got . " I picked up the flints and juggled them in one hand . " But we 've all got something . It comes out of where we 've already been . Stuff that 's happened . Stuff that 's stayed with us . " " You want to tell me ? " Then , " Will you tell me ? " " Tell you what ? " " What you 've got . What you remember . " " Well , " I said , thinking , " all the time I was growing up , I was hardly ever off snowshoes , except in the summer , which is mighty short up on the Range . I hunted all the time , and trapped . My father had a bunch of lines , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time . I got to know what lived up there in the snow , and how they lived . Some of the animals , and birds , live by being able to hide , and the others live by being able to find ' em . But being hard to see , to make out , is part of it on both sides . The rabbit do n't want the lynx or the weasel to find him , and the lynx and the fox and the weasel do n't want the rabbit to know they 're around till it 's too late . " He kept waiting , and I said , " I could take you up on the slope right now , or on out into the muskeg , and you would n't be able to see a single animal that was there . And they 'd be all around you . Stillness is a big thing with rabbits and marmots . The meat hunters will get after anything that moves . But the rabbits can fool ' em a lot of the time . In that snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to be close to ' em to do it . Without the eyes there 's nothing there . Or there might as well not be . " He was not sure , but it did n't make any difference to me . " You ever see a human do anything like that ? " " Well , no , " I said . " A human 's not a rabbit or a lynx . But you can do something like it . Do n't think you ca n't . You do n't have the fur , but you got more sense than them . " " I 've never seen snow , " he said , changing the subject , because  | he saw I did n't want to say anything else about that one . " I like the ocean , myself . " " I do , too , " I told him . " But for me the ocean ai n't the ocean unless it 's got ice in it . It 's just what you 're used to , I guess . " A little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I climbed in with the rest of the crews . As it turned out , only nine planes were making the strike , which meant there was likely to be more fighter concentration . I told the Florida boy , who was riding with me , that we 'd have more to shoot at , but it did n't seem to make him feel any better . As for me , I was pretty well rested , and ready for whatever might be up there . The mission would take around fourteen hours , which is a lot of time to sit and think , with nothing going on most of the time . When we got to the ship I stretched and loosened up , and felt over myself for my gear . I had a .45 and two clips , my emergency kit and a can of C rations , and my knife , down there where it should be . I stretched some more and said hello to Major Sorbo . " Ready for ' em , Ace ? " the Major asked me . " Not an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Along with the others I got in , then went back to my station to see if everything was exactly like I had left it . It was , except that somebody had put a tarp cover over the pile of chutes , and I could n't think of any reason I might need to take it off , though I would 've liked to check the one chute that was taped down . I was more or less sure it was all right , and I got in behind my guns , hooked my suit up to the electrical system , and plugged my headset into the jack . After a while Major Sorbo started the engines , and we wheeled out to take off .  | The back end of an airplane is not one of the worst places in it . There were at least a couple of yards between me and anybody else , and it was like I had all that section of the plane to myself . When I called in on the preflight check , Major Sorbo might have been back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another part of things . We took off , and I settled in against the side of the plane until we got up past the Jap picket boats , and the night fighters scrambled and got after us . That new gunner , the Florida boy , had got me thinking with his questions , and there was not any reason I could n't just go along on the same track , just to have something to do . I had left off when I was telling him about the icebergs , and I started in now , thinking about them like I remembered . I looked out through my plexiglass , and it came to me that clouds and icebergs were a lot alike , because they were beautiful just like they were , and there was no use to them at all . There was no reason for them to be like they were , and have the shapes that they did , except that that was the way they happened to be , for nothing . Where my father and I had lived was on the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a kind of a draw that kept off most of the wind . It was easy to follow the draw on down to the flat country at the bottom of the mountains , and it was also easy , more or less , to stay on the slope where you could see more , down under you . We had most of the traps along the slope , in different places from the flat up until it got too steep . We had our best luck where there was some slant , but not too much . My mother died before I ever knew anything about her , and my old man , who was originally from Virginia , got hold of the land up there for almost nothing , learned to make out with weather and the traps , and as soon as he could he brought me  | over from Barrow , where I was born , to the cabin . I never did go to school , at least not when I was young . My father taught me to read and write and what he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . He had his own reasons for being there , which he never did get around to telling me , or that I ever really understood . It may have been he got into some kind of trouble , back in Virginia or somewhere in the States , though I do n't think it had anything to do with the law . But something had happened to him that made him want to be by himself ; or maybe he was just that way all the time . Like I say , he never did give me the straight of it . But he liked it up there in that place , where you hardly ever heard anything but the wind , and where anybody who did n't know how things were could get lost as quick as he could take five steps . But I was brought up in the snow . Until the time I was fifteen , I used snowshoes more than I used my natural feet ; my feet felt wrong when I took off the shoes . My father used to tell me I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was more than ten or eleven I was showing him stuff that I 'd picked up by myself , rambling around all over , as much as I could , from Teshekpuk Point to the Colville River and back . In all that time I never saw but one wolverine , and my father never did see one ; he 's just heard the stories about them , like the other trappers . But I was proud of mine , which I saw on the gut pile of a down caribou , because I knew then that the wildest animal in the world , the one with the most stories about him , the most bad and strong magic of any of them , had looked at me ? looked right at me , for a good half a minute , through the feather snow . That was enough . I 'm glad my old man thought of me like that . It bothered me that I had told the Florida boy anything . He had probably already forgotten everything I 'd said , in the time-  | wasting time before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wherever it 's cold enough , I can get along . Snow and wind are right for me . Dark weather is right . Nearly everything about the cold is good . The cold-weather birds are the best to eat and the prettiest by far ; there 's not a bird in any jungle that can compare with them . The cold-water fish are better , and stronger , and taste like fish ought to taste ; the cold water makes the meat good and firm . And I love fur , and the animals that grow it . I like to sleep in a fur parka with ice all around me . Eskimos , the Nanamuit in our range , at a town there , Anaktuvuk , showed me how to cut the slabs of snow and ice , fit them , and seal them , so that you 've got yourself a real quick strong house . When you get in there , you do n't need anything but your parka . It 's all good ; you 're OK . I nodded back against the airplane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But it was the wrong cold . The cold of high air is not real , it 's not honest . Cold should be connected to the ground , even if it 's at the top of a mountain . I eased back again and started to move with the caribou from the tundra through the tree line into their winter range . I looked at my watch . It had moved some , more than I would have thought . We were probably past the picket ships by now . I got into position behind the guns , and as soon as I did , the Major called and told us we were over the Kanto Plain , and that we could expect fighters . We all knew the Kanto area could scramble a lot of them . I charged both guns and fired off a few rounds , and then leaned forward and watched and waited . I had a way of doing things that was about half the Air Force 's and half mine . When I came into gunnery school , it took me time to adjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in an airplane and the target is  | another airplane . I had shot with a lead all my life : birds , caribou , rabbits , you name it . But I had never shot at anything that was moving when I was in something moving myself , and for a while it threw me , threw me off . But there 's really not all that much to it . If you 're in the tail of a plane , you 've got real good visibility . In the daytime you can see anything that 's close enough to shoot at you . At night ifs a little different , because the other aircraft has to shoot first , before you can tell where he is by his guns . That bothers some people , but there 's no need for it to . Usually the fighter will open up before he really gets into the range where his guns will do him any good , and when he does that you 've got him , because when you see those gun glitters , you put together a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which side of you he 's on , he 's got to put his inside wing down and the other wing up to get his guns on you . If he 's on the right side of your plane , the starboard side , he 's got to put his right wing down ; if he 's on the port side , it 'd be his left wing . When that happens you 've got the situation you want , because the line that maneuver puts him on is all in your favor . It 's like the fighter was sliding down a string , and he is ; he ca n't shoot at you unless he is on it . All you have to do is put your sight in front of him , according to where he is on the curve , track with him , and let him have it . My favorite shot is two widths of the sight ring ? two rads ? down to one . I let him have a three-second burst , right in there . But zero rads is not bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually under you , before he breaks off and down . When he 's at zero rads , you go right at him , right into his teeth with the fifties , and you can make him live hard . So I waited for that . We were close to the bomb line , I was  | sure . The bombardier did n't have the plane yet , and the bomb bay doors were not open , but there was that tension you always feel all over the ship when the time comes close to drop . There should have been fighters , and there were n't any . The part before the bomb run felt all right , but the rest of the situation did n't . Then something hit us from underneath . Or , more like it , something hit at us , like it blew up the air right below us . " Hold on , " Major Sorbo said , real loud ; I believe I could have heard him without the intercom . " We got to leave this altitude . Hold on . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , not with the first crack of ground fire ; it usually took them a lot longer to get us bracketed . We began to lose altitude , and I sucked on my tongue to clear my ears . We leveled out , and even before the half G of pull left me , I saw the sparkle of a fighter . Like always , he was too far off . He had showed on the port side of us , and I kept that in mind , and swung the guns . Then he was close to us , much closer than I would have thought , and firing . I fired back , but was n't on him . I did n't think he hit us , though ? at least not bad . Another fighter showed on the same side , and this time I was ready for any rate of closure he might have . He fired again , and was in range , and hit us a little somewhere up the fuselage , as near as I could tell . He fired again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I figured was two rads and cut loose . Nothing happened . I waited a second , until I judged he was point-blank line astern and below , and cut loose again , all three seconds . The whole sky lit up . I must have hit his tanks , because the explosion was all over the place , and he was gone . I asked the  | Major if he had seen the plane blow , and he said yes , everybody did , and get off the horn . I went back to watching for guns , but I was not really satisfied with myself , because I had been wrong on one or two points , and I never had before . The two fighters I had credit for had been knocked down in daylight , but the other three , which I know damn well I got , were at night . I know , because I do aerial gunnery in a certain way . I do n't shoot at the plane , I shoot at the pilot . Or I shoot where I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is like guessing , but not quite . You know that the pilot is halfway between his guns on most fighters , and right behind them on the others , and you just estimate that . When he fires at you from his pursuit curve , his guns have a relation to each other , a tilt , an angle , so that you can more or less tell how fast he 's coming down the string . You feel , you guess , and then you fire . If he fires a little before you , you try to nail him between his guns , but when he 's in close range , I try not to let him do that . I shoot before he does , by guess and by God . But all the time I 'm going for the pilot , not the plane . The thing inside that I shoot by ? guess or God or whatever you might want to call it ? tells me when I 'm on . The four confirmed kills that I had were hit that way ; there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were confirmed because they were going down out of control , and the people on my crew could see them , and some of the crews on the other ships could , too . I nailed the other three at night the same way , but the planes did n't explode , nobody saw them go down , and I did n't get credit . But they went , same as the others . I led them in ; they came to me , came right down my throat . I fired on that split second , and they were gone . Long gone , I 'm telling you . I know what I 'm talking about . At the new altitude we went into the bomb run . The born-  | hardier , Lieutenant Madison , took over the plane , and we steadied on through the run , getting off the two-thousandpounders and the payload of incendiaries we had , maybe as a warmup for the big raid the Colonel had been talking about . It 's always a relief when you get the bombs off the racks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing flak or any more fighters , and I could see two fires , one a lot bigger than the other , where we had hit the city , or the other planes had . It was an easy enough run so far . We were supposed to have dropped some two-thousand-pounders , some incendiaries , and some frag bombs on the Kiba area of Tokyo , the waterfront , and we had , and now we could pick up the home heading and get out of there . The next thing was not fire , though later I realized that it had to do with fire , had fire in it , but it did not seem like fire that was separate from us , or that could have been to one side of us , or above or below us . No , it was like the inside of the plane had exploded and we , each one of us , had exploded . It was like we were inside an explosion , or maybe we had exploded from inside ourselves . That 's as close as I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the turn for home when it hap-pened . When I could think , I saw that I was over the butts of my guns . The wind was knocked out of me , but I could move all right , and I held on to the strap of my seat harness and turned around . The plane leaned up on one wing like it was going into a turn , but it kept leaning . Nobody could have been controlling it and making it go any such way . Then the nose went down , and I knew we were completely gone ; everybody on the flight deck was probably dead . One of the waist gunners , I think it might  | have been the Florida boy , was stretched out right in the middle of the air , his arms and legs going wild trying to fetch up against something solid , to get hold of a chest chute . Then he was gone ? on the floor , on the wall , the ceiling , I could n't tell . Equipment was flying all over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything was , except that I saw a chest chute bounce off one wall and a hand reach out for it and miss , and the chute was not there , or the hand . We were nose-down now , spinning , the wings going around the airplane . " Man , I am here , " I heard myself say , and it did n't surprise me too much . I unbuckled from the seat , and just as soon as I did I banged against a wall . But I was holding on to the seat-strap web , and I kept holding on to it , and worked my feet forward into the plane . I got banged around a lot , swinging like a clapper in a bell , but I caught on to another web strap ? it must have been one of the ones for storage ? and pulled on toward where the chutes had been , and the hatch was . The chute I had taped was still taped , the only one there , and I pulled it loose , and , one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and buckling with the other , I snapped the chute to my chest , over the emergency kit , everything going round and round , faster and faster . I ' he hatch was only a few feet farther on , and I scrambled and twisted along to it , and pulled the pins . The hatch stayed . And then the only lucky thing of the night happened . The ship yawed like it had been hit again , and swung me on the strap away from the hatch , so that I could get my feet around . When the plane swung back the other way , it swung me , too , and I hit the hatch with both feet , with everything I had . It was gone . I could see the sky whirling outside the hole in the plane . The air would knock your teeth loose , but it was  | outside air . I had my door to the open , and went out through it , and had the whole thing , the whole sky . The first thing was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . I was tumbling ? sometimes I saw stars and sometimes I did n't see anything , anything but black ? and the wind seemed to whip the air out of my nose sideways . But I could see enough to tell that I had some altitude , enough to open the chute , and I waited a little to figure the best way to do it . You 're supposed to be facing the ground , with your head a little lower than your feet , when you pull the chute , so that when the lines pay out and the chute opens , the risers will swing you under , and you wo n't get that terrific grab up through the crotch , that might be bad in a lot of ways . I spread out my arms to try to stabilize , and it was as easy as something in a dream . It crossed my mind how out of control the plane had been , there at the last , and how easy it was to control the way I was falling , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to fly without an airplane . But that was dangerous : I could have held on to the notion too long . I felt for the handle , and took hold of it with my right hand , though I hated to pull my arms back in ; I was half believing they were wings . Dangerous , like I say . Then I put my left forearm across my face , because with a chest pack the risers whip right across your face when they come out , and pulled . Something stuck . I pulled again , and it still stuck . I pulled again , hard as I could , and the handle came away . It felt like I had thrown loose my whole arm , thrown my arm away , but I was still falling , turning over from the position they 'd taught me . What the hell , I thought ; that 's all I can do . I was shot , nigh the armpits and between both legs .  | There 'd been a loud pop , a crack like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My face had taken a lick , too ; I felt of it , and it was wet on one side . But the chute was open . I looked up at it , and started to make my thinking include it , and the reason for the cracking sound , and the new hurt under my arms and between my legs . The chute . It was the chute . I was in a very big , quiet place in the middle of the air , and not shot . Not shot . I could n't get rid of the idea that I had been . I looked around from my float , from my big wide calm place in the middle of things . Swaying back and forth , I concentrated on the situation . It was the first time I had ever tried to concentrate and sway at the same time , and it was not a bad feeling , though I would n't want to do it every day . Right under me was dark , but to my left was a lot of silver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It went way out , out into the moonlight as far as I could see . I was not far from all that silver , and I started to wonder about where I would hit . Breaking a leg was not part of my plan , but you can always do that in the dark , and I could n't see anything right under me at all . I felt for the risers , because I knew I could control where I hit , or control it to a certain extent . But I did n't have anything to sight on except the water . I think I could have slipped the chute enough to land in the water , just barely , but what would have been the good of that ? I did n't need to be wet , I needed to b on the ground with no broken bones , dry and figuring . Even though I could n't see where I was going to come down , was not near enough to the ground so that I could n't spill part of the chute and make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted , but it was the dark or the water , no matter what , end the more I thought about it , the more I wanted the land .  | Dow close to the water , though ? How close to the docks , or whatever was there ? I did n't want to land on top of a building that I could n't get down from , or on somebody 's roof , if I could help it . I was getting closer . I could hear a siren , a lot like the ones the Air Force has . I looked inland toward the fires . The smoke came past me , and there was cordite in it from some of our bombs . About a half mile from me there was a lot of stuff burning , and I hoped that would keep people away from where I was going to hit . I was still high enough to get a fairly good view . I could see the docks now , and the ocean spreading out in another way from the first way . Between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , thin , and bent , and I could see through them , see the ocean , like silver cloth that 's been slung out and ruffled and sewed together with black thread : all that , on the side toward the moon . Quicker than I would have thought it could be done to me , there was a terrific clutch up between my legs . Under my shoulders , too . My shoulders stopped where they were , and so did I , jigging up and down in the harness , wondering what the hell . I must have still been fifty feet off the ground , and I was hanging . Not hurting , but hanging , and could have swung myself if I 'd had a mind . I looked up at the risers . The chute was collapsed and hung up on something , one of the things that made the long shadows , maybe , or were the long shadows themselves . Though there were not any lights , I could make out the space between the buildings and the water , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If I could get down without anybody seeing me , I could go on to whatever might he next , on my own . T O T H E W H I T E S E A But I could n't just hang there in the smoke , which was colored with red and seemed to have some kind of wind that came with it , shifting back and forth , turning one way , then back the other . I felt down in it with my feet , felt around on all sides , twisting in the harness , trying to make contact , but there was not anything there for me . I pulled on the risers to see how my strength was , and I had some . I started up the lines , arming it out , hand over hand . When I reached the bottom of the nylon , like a sheet half off a bed , I went past it to where the chute was caught , and felt for what it was caught on . It was a gantry , a loading crane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground . Holding to the metal , I unsnapped the chute and was a lot freer , just in a second . I worked up the crane and out the arm to where the chute was caught , and cut it loose . A backswirl of the crazy smoke-wind caught it , and it disappeared , collapsing , toward the buildings back from the docks . I housed the knife , crawled head-first back along the arm , and started down the main body of the crane , not hurrying , but little by little , watching and listening all-out . The crosspieces of the thing hurt my feet pretty bad when I put both of them in the same place , and on one section I just had to slide down one of the main beams ? shinny , kind of ? but I did it . Getting to the ground was something I could tell I was going to be able to do , by now . When I got to the top of the cab , I turned loose all the beams and struts and looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ladder on the cab , and I used it . The ground was level cement , and full of power . I leaned against the wheel of the cab , In the shadow away from the moon . The smoke was still blowing , though maybe not so much , and somewhere in it , down the wk from where I was , I heard voices , and they were coming . I  | hit a stillness , a new stillness like a marmot 's , and two little men came by , shorter than me even , almost transparent with smoke , talking right into each other 's face . I had n't had time to find the chute , and I hoped they would n't notice it , wherever it was . I had my hand on my knife but did n't even crack the blade to light , to any sort of light . I did n't want to give light a chance at it , even though I was in the shadow of the crane . They went past till I could n't hear them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went looking for the chute , and finally found it spread and crumpled over some barrels and boxes , like it was making a display . I bundled it up and shoved it under the boxes , piled some other boxes and crates on it , then walked back a ways toward the crane ? it was friendly ? and tried to size up the situation , decide what to do . I really did n't have any notion just then ; just a feeling something like the one I got when the guns of the fighter sparkled and I knew he was on the pursuit curve ; a feeling that was a kind of guess but not completely ; a guess with another thing added to it , something I did n't have a name for . I did n't want a name . It was not words . What did I need ? Where the bombs had hit had been concentrated in one place , I had seen from the chute , but the smoke was fading off now and I could n't hear any more sirens . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with the fire . And the bomb drop was only in a small part of Tokyo . Since I had n't seen any night watchmen on the ocean side of the docks , I thought I might have a look down the streets between the dock buildings and try to find out what they went into . I edged out past the corner of the warehouse nearest to the crane , looked as far as I could toward the city , and then started down  | that way , in the fullest and longest shadows I could find . If I saw a single person , I would turn back and try something else . I got almost to the end of the building , and could see a little way into the blacked-out blocks , when I heard voices ? not one or two but a lot . A whole crowd went by the end of my truck alley , talking fast . There was no light but moonlight , but I could make them out against the cement of the street and the lightcolored buildings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had no odds going for me . Using the same shadows , I went back to the dock and to the crane . What had bored me before , the words of the Colonel at the briefing , all his talk about fire , came up in my head , and all over me . Fire was what I needed , fire from my own side . I needed a whole city in panic , a lot of confusion , as much as there could be , and things would be different . I did n't know when the raid would come , but I knew that it would be soon . Soon . Maybe a day , another night . I would find a way to wait it out . In the first shadows again , working from one crane to the other , I made it to the end of the dock and just stood paying attention , all the attention I had , to what was there , to what was only a step or two away , or might have been in a few more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were more docks , more warehouses . But I was interested in the field between , and what happened when it came together with the water . I'here was no ladder down . I could n't tell exactly , but I judged It was not far to the ground , though . I hung by my hands off the edge of the concrete , and dropped . I hit almost right away . The field , whatever kind of ground it  | was , was slanted toward the water , and I did n't count on that , and hit wrong and fell . I rolled and had my knife out and ready to come up , but there was nobody around . Since it was out , I took the satisfaction of watching the blade flash off the moon . I looked around and did it again , and the satisfaction was as much as anybody could have wanted . I could see a lot better , too , and I wo n't say that it was n't because of the knife flash . Steel that good , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , you ca n't tell what might happen . Like I tell you , I believe in things like that . It do n't matter why . The field was set against the water by a kind of wall , cement ? a breakwater , I think somebody called it . I inched along the top of it on my belly , like a lizard , running my hand , trying to feel if there might be some kind of hole in it , some place I might be able to wedge into . It took a long time to do it , and I really had n't come all that ways from the docks when I felt into something , something not concrete , but hard and wet . I smelt of my fingers and knew where they 'd been . Using one of my matches , letting it burn nearly all the way down to my fingers , I got a good notion of what was there : a sewer pipe that fell off into the ocean , big enough to hold a man ; not running too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my feet in . The smell put my eyes out . I mean , it hit my eyeballs like the worst light , and one that would never quit . My eyes , you know , and that was not meant to be . But it was a hole , and I could go on into it if I wanted to . I took out another match and lit it , though I knew that sewers could blow up . That would be something else , I said to myself , to get out of a B-29 on fire and blow yourself up with shit gas . But nothing blew , and I went on up  | amongst the squishing shit and other stuff , to where there was a turn , where I was damn sure nobody would come . To do it , they 'd have to come the same way I had , and I could n't think of anybody who 'd do that , not even the Japs , no matter what . For one day , maybe for a day and a night , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , what else have you got a right to ask for in the enemy 's own damn country , his main city ? What else ? I broke back out , and the big air was good , I tell you . The moon was higher , and the stars were so strong they seemed to be blasting light at me , like studs or screw heads that had that kind of power . I broke off a stalk of something from the field and marked the sewer , and started back along the breakwater , this time standing up . So far , things were working . The whole thing was working , right where I stood , where I walked along the silver ocean of the Japs and looked out over the big sewedtogether bay . When I got back to the crane I had a sudden thought : how quick could I get to the pipe ? I looked at my watch and took off , running light as I could along the front of the warehouses , my moon shadow in front of me . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right into the air over the field , like I was trying to jump from the cement loading slabs of my dock toward that other one off as far as I could see , and I hung up there over the field-dark for the longest time , almost like being in the chute again , except that this time it was just me instead of a lot of harness and nylon , and when I hit this time I did n't fall . I found the stalk of stuff I 'd left at the edge and let myself down into the hole and swung in , my eyes stinging . I came out again and went back to the crane , listening for night watchmen but not all that much . It was two-thirty in the morning . I did n't have any notion of sleeping in the shit pipe , so  | I climbed into the cab . It cut off the wind and had a big seat , big enough for two people . I took the control handles , set them off from the seat , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work on the docks in Tokyo , but I figured I could get at least a couple of hours of fresh-air sleep before anybody came . Before that , I would hit for the pipe . I wanted to sleep in control , and not just like some desperate guy with no chance . There were certain things I had , and I knelt down on the floor of the cab and went over them , holding the matches down below the windows . My knife I knew about , and left it alone this time . I laid out my .45 and two clips . There was no telling where I might use them , but it would have to be either in a place where nobody could hear or in a situation with so much noise and confusion that nobody 'd care , or even notice . I thought about the Colonel 's fire , and decided that I would wait a day or two in the whole concentrated stink of Tokyo , crammed into a little pipe , for them to bring the fire : for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could operate . I needed to get outfitted , and that meant I needed some clothes different from a wired-up combat rig , a flight suit underneath it , and GI brogans . I could n't last long in Tokyo , either in daylight or at night , in what I had on . If the fire came ? when the fire came ? I would go out with the .45 and get what I needed . I broke open my emergency kit and spread the stuff on the seat , wondering what situations might come up where I 'd use it ? use this thing and then that thing . There was a little knife that I could use for little doings , like cutting string or scaling fish . There was a packet of fishhooks and some twine . There was a silk map of part of japan , like a handkerchief printed with  | a topo layout of Japan up to the strait between Honshu and Hokkaido , and another piece of silk that had an American flag on it , and writing in five or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of them . I could n't read them , but all the crews had had to memorize what they said : I am an American aviator My aircraft is destroyed . I am an enemy of the Japanese . Please take me to the nearest American authorities . The government of my country will pay you . Like I say , I could n't read any of this stuff , but I looked at all that writing , in Annamese , Burmese , Thai ( it said ) , French , and Japanese , and I struck a blank wall on whether I should keep it . I looked by the match light , before the match went out , and tried to make a decision . But it was funny , anyway , and I think I laughed right there in the cab , and real loud , too . It was quiet there . I sat on the floor of the cab with my things on the seat : gun , bullets , fishhooks , map , blood chit with all the languages , and leaned back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could be more out of luck . Except that there could be . Both times it was myself , and I knew that when I got down into the pipe ? when the sun came up I had to get down into it ? I would be even worse off , and if the fire did n't come down on Tokyo , it was only a question of time before somebody would find me , if I did n't drown in the flood of Tokyo shit , and no matter how hard I fought or however many I might be able to kill , I would lose . I would have my balls cut off , I would have my head cut off , and that would be it . But not yet . I took out the C rations and wound the key around the can . It was not so bad : a kind of cold hash , and I ate it all , and stretched out on the seat when I 'd put my stuff back the way it was . There was really nothing to worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Colonel 's B-29s would come , or they would n't . That was not up to me . There was a long dream in which a buffalo , something I had never seen except in pictures , ran across in front of me , and for some reason I could n't move my eyes or my head , but had to stare front and center while he went by . He was big , and for some reason I felt like I could even ride on his back , but I could n't reach him , or give him any notion of how I felt . He went by me on some kind of a raised platform that was like a breakwater . It was the breakwater that made the buffalo be there like he was . There was no doubt about it in the dream , or when I woke up , either . It was all good , I mean it . All the problems were for the next day . Nobody was going to check the cab of a loading crane between three and five in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter what the war was . I woke up , more or less , saw that it was still black dark , saw one star , and went back , waiting for the buffalo to come across again , on a line just above the ocean . That was something beautiful . Light , and I was dead . I knew it , and kept watching . Sometimes I looked , actually , and at other times I looked in my sleep and it was the same ; through my eyelids it was the same ; I could see the sun , and water . But when I heard feet , and voices amongst them , I knew I could n't give away any more . I raised up , and twenty or thirty guys were going by , right by me , on their way  | somewhere . As much as I could , just at eye level over the bottom of the window , I watched where they went . The light was gray . It was first dawn , and if I was going to get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . Little by little I let myself out of the cab and dropped down between the rails . Most of the men had gone into the warehouses , and as far as I could tell the few others would go in when they got around to it . I looked at my watch . It had taken me nineteen seconds to get to my hole before . Could I do it now ? Could I time it so that nobody saw ? Out on the Range , the Brooks Range , I had got where I was scared of the human voice ; you did n't expect there to be one . I knew now that , when I made my move , if anybody sang out , I was dead . I crouched down between the rails and put my head up one more time . All but two or three of the men had gone into the warehouses . They were opening them up with big sick clangs and scrapes of galvanized iron . I stared at one guy especially , who kept hesitating and looking back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things turned on , and when he took a step or two toward the buildings , I broke . I was on the wall in a second , not hunching but putting my head down and digging , but digging light , and there was not a sound but me . When I got to the piece of reed I had stuck up , I hit the top of the breakwater side-on and slid over , my feet going into the hole . I even broke off the stalk with my hand as I went down . ' here I was . All the time I was growing up , I was on the side of the hunters , the foxes and weasels and lynxes , on the side of the wolverines , because we were doing the same thing : we were hunting the others . But when I got my feet into the sewer pipe , and was sure I was in that hole in the side of the sea wall , that I had found it and had come back to hide in it , I knew a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had n't thought about , or thought about enough . I knew how the marmot feels when he makes it to his hole , how the badger feels , how the snowshoe hare feels when he understands that the color that 's been given him is right , that it works ? or works right now , anyway ? that nothing can get him because nothing can find him . Any animal would have had a better hole than I had , but it was all the same thing : we were in our place , me and the rest of them . But my God , it was awful . I wasted another match , and risked blowing up on shit gas , to get back to the curve , and went on up beyond it and sat down in the shit and other slow-moving stuff . I waited , but I could n't stay there long , and edged on out toward the ocean until I could see it , and smell it , through the shit and God knows what else was in there . All day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night and the fire . I had put it into my head that I should n't show anything around the curve of the pipe , because if anybody found the chute , there would be an all-out search . Somebody might even have a look into the pipe , or at least shine a flashlight up it . But I would be sure to hear them before they saw me , and could duck back . So , as it turned out I spent most of the day at the curve , looking out at the sky , which was a little blue circle at the end of everything , and that filled up with whatever I wanted to be there . The caribou had been good to me , in my mind , especially since we took the first hit in the 29 ; before that I had n't known how good . Them coming out of the woods was a beautiful thing to think . In such huge space they were , in snow that was more like ice , a little cautious , a little slow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open , in the overcast light that makes the snow more merciless than it is any other time , in the long afternoon that never ends . And then they are gone off into the  | winter range , and there 's nothing left but the snow . Let there be a little more fall-down , I said , more snow . The caribou are good , the tracks are beautiful and good , but let the snow drift them down , let it drift them under . It happened . The eye of the pipe I was in went away so far that there was not any more of it ; everything there was snow . The snow of the Brooks Range , or some other snow . But snow . Snow , not a track on it . I knew , then , what I needed to do . The little compass would point north , no matter what I did , whether it was outside my body or in it . North was north , and it would stay that way . And there was the pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that was not called north but was at the same place , the thing nobody could say . By feel I pulled out the compass again , though I did n't want to take too much of the adhesive off my body tape . It would be better , though , if I knew whether the compass was luminous or not . It was , and that was good ; night was going to be my time , at least until I got to the heavy snow . " An asshole compass , " I said out loud , my voice coming back from the sides of the pipe and maybe having some kind of roundness to it , from the shape of the galvanized tin or iron , or whatever I was in , looking off at the little circle of nearly black blue that was the bay , the ocean , the rest of the world . " Some compass , " I said to the echo . " Right here I 've already got a pretty close connection to half the assholes in Tokyo . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow-moving stuff I was sitting in . I wondered how I would smell when I got out among people . Something would have to he done about it , first thing . " Come on , boys , " I said to Tinian Island , out through the round walls and the little ocean at the end of them . " Come on with all that fire . Let me out of this place . Come on , night . Come on , fire . "  | I thought of the snow , and one long kayak trip I took with an Eskimo buddy , Tornarssuk , east toward Kaktovik , hunting for seals . At one place we went by a big glacial berg that calved off about half a mile from us with a sound like a woman who had been reamed up through the gut . When the ice slid off the near side of it , the brightest blue I ever saw in my life came right at us , it seemed like , so deep and pale it could have been some new kind of scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen before . The ice just slid down off it , and it was there , a thing , a new color just invented , but one that had also been waiting in the ice for a long time , a real long time , just for two guys in a kayak to see it . We were the only ones who did . We sat there for a while . Tornarssuk took his paddle out of the water , and so did I. We just stared off at that pale blue that came to us out of the big white , that came to us and went right through us , and I did n't ask Tornarssuk what he was doing or why he was doing it for so long , because I knew all that . There is not much color in an Eskimo 's life , not more than three or four colors that are strong and simple : white most of the time , for almost everything that 's on the ground ; the blue of the sky when it 's clear ; the gray-green of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is blood , the brightest blood in the world , wherever you see it up there . So I let Tornarssuk stare on , let the split glacier come into him as it must have been doing into me ? that pale , concentrated , pure , huge-sided light . And I used it now , in the shit tunnel , as part of the plan I was making . In the pipe I sat like I had in the kayak with Tornarssuk , with the iceberg coming through me . Every now and then I brought in the red of the far wall of my father 's cabin , as I would see it coming in off the Range , as red as any blood in the snow , but always I came hack , without trying , to the calm ocean and the  | berg , with the pack ice around the base of it , sending that light , just-invented blue color at me , keeping my paddle out of the water . That was the afternoon . The blue-black at the end of the pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle of the pipe , at least as far as my being able to see it was concerned . I would give it another hour by my watch , and then poke my head out and see if I could pick up Polaris . I did n't make it to the end of the pipe , or at least not right then . The whole thing squeezed together all at once , from all sides but especially the top , and drove my eardrums back into my head , pushed toward each other by some big quick clamp , like earphones coming together a hundred times harder than they were supposed to . There was a sound when this happened , but my head hurt so much from the in-driving on my drums that I did n't remember it until later . It was a big thump , though , one that was in the air , most likely . It was made out of air but had body to it , a lot of body , just for a second . The pipe shook with it ; the water going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my tongue and started to crawl . It was not Polaris I was looking for now : those were explosions . " Come on , " I said , crawling hard . " Come on . Let them have it . More . All you got . " And then , " Let me have it . " There in the shit pipe , heading for the outside to stay out , I called that fire down . I did all I could from where I was . I got out and stood up , and looked back inland . There was a low red glow , very wide , with some white in it . I had n't even straightened up when four or five more bombs hit , all in a line and spaced more or less even with each other . The line must have covered at least a mile , and right away the fire went wider , and a lot higher . There was already smoke , though the docks , at least my part of them , had n't been hit .  | But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to that at night . They were running back and forth amongst the cranes , and in between the bombs I could hear them screaming and gabbling . That was the way I wanted it , sure enough , and I took off across the field toward the fire , running easy . The field was tough and springy ; my feet went down , went forward , and came back under me . I was not afraid of holes . I felt very light and a little better than usual , even . When I was a boy , in the summer , and the snow melted off the lower part of the Range below our cabin , I used to go down to where there was a field ? a field that was like a road , though nobody had made it or used it ? and run , the first day I got the snowshoes off my feet . I was so used to them that it was hard to believe I was n't still lifting them step by step , and slowed way down from even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and run with just my feet , and the whole land ? the flat and the mountains to one side , and everything I could see ? speeded up , and I really took off . I felt like I was the fastest thing in the world , the fastest-moving , the fastest thinking , the most free human there was . And freer than that : freer than any lynx , any mallard , any salmon or tern or bufflehead . I would n't be able to tell you that I could n't fly ; that would be next . Going over ground so fast and so free that it was wrong , except that I liked it so much , was so different from moving over snow that I wished every year for a few minutes that it would never snow again , or that we could move off the Brooks Range and live somewhere else . But when the snow came hack I was ready , and happy to get hack on the shoes where I belonged . " There 's too much  | easiness in just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowshoes are solid , solid-down : they give you a balance you ought to have . But now I was running just in my GI boots , and over the field I had the summer feeling . I had the freedom and the drunk power , and I knew I had better watch myself , and slow down before I went much farther . The smoke was beginning to sting my eyes bad ; I was going right into it . As near as I could tell , two streets came together at the edge of the field , and every time the smoke shifted I could tell that there were plenty of people there , not going back and forth but all moving one way . They kept crowding past , to my right . I could hear them : a long moaning sound they all made together , and a sharp scream like a bird , or more like a trapped rabbit , rising out of it . I slowed down until I was almost walking , and then saw that would n't do because all of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole movement of the crowd was slow , even slower than they would have been going on snowshoes . I picked up to a jog , because I wanted to get in amongst them at about the same speed , the same pace , and blend in. was n't there yet , though . I was maybe seventy-five yards from the people in the crowd nearest me , but I could n't say it was exactly that far . The wind would shift back and forth , and clear the view for a few seconds , and then the smoke would thicken up and I had to guess . The smoke did n't act like any smoke I had ever seen , and I listened more the nearer I got to the streets . In amongst the long moaning of the people there were low heavy crumps , like a rifle firing with a blanket around the barrel . This was the three-hundred-plane raid , all right . This was it . The more I listened , the more I could hear the incendiaries hitting behind the crowds in the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm up , a heavy slash of heat , and I turned around toward the docks . Up and down where I had been was on fire , with the deep orange of napalm and also the blue-white of white phosphorus , which is not so much like any fire you 'd know , but was more like the end of a blowtorch , all spread out and shooting up curlicues and wriggles of itself like tracers that had gone crazy , and were meant to . Even in the situation I was in , I could n't get over the smoke , the way the smoke acted . In a low red light that was over everything before I even realized it was there , the smoke would all of a sudden stir itself , whirl around , and cut one way or the other . It would jog and slant , and settle , then jump and swirl again and go the other way , or come right at me . The incendiaries were hitting everywhere , in front of me and on both sides , but nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Now , though , as I got closer to the streets , whenever the smoke would blast one way or the other with the bombs ? it was hard to believe those quick jumps and jogs were not something the smoke was doing to itself ? I could see fire , low fire , buildings and not just white phosphorus twisting in the air , down the street I would be on if I kept running and came off the field and did n't turn . Through the blasts of smoke I got into the crowd , making the turn to be in their direction and slowing down to their pace , which was a kind of fast shuffle . I could n't tell much about the people , even the ones who were right next to me , except that they were women , a couple of them with babies . There was one old man bent over like a squirrel . I just caught a glimpse of hint , and then he went down under all of us , and we went on over hint , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stopped dead , and then  | came back and hit us square , face-on . Then I was on top of somebody on the ground , and there was another one on me , or maybe two . I rolled a woman ? I 'm sure ? to one side and got my feet under me . The others were getting up , and it bothered me that I might have stood up too quick and would show my difference , even in all the confusion . The new fire was right in front of us , on both sides of the street , and all of a sudden I looked down , because something was wrong . The zipper of my flight suit caught the light , and caught it strong just for a second , and without any pain I had the notion that I had been gutted , ripped right down the middle by fire , by lightning maybe , and that I was dead from it ; that I had come out on the other side alive with another kind of life , still holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow with the others . Nobody had noticed a thing . We started , and turned off into another street , the smoke jumping and slanting with the bombs . The sound of the crowd around me was made up of high yells , all you could put up with , but around them all was the low sound , which must have been coming from the whole city . How all those high screams could have added up to that one low tone , like a glacier when it first begins to calve off , was not something I could explain . It must have had something to do with the buildings ? echoes ? all those voices beating back and forth off the walls . Maybe , but I do n't know . On the second street the smoke was bad , even worse than on the other one , and for the first time I noticed how terrific the heat was , and steady , not just near the fires we could see . I kept as close as I could to the woman in front of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that my zipper would n't show in the . flames , but I knew I had better do something about my clothes while I could . I looked around as much as I was able , and I  | started to figure , in there shuffling with the rest of them , sweating like a thaw , and adding up what I had with me . I was sure glad I was a great believer in tape . My bread knife was riding down my leg , almost a part of me , just as much in place as it had been in the Quonset hut back at Tinian , and the emergency kit was square in the middle of my chest , breathing with me , and ready to do all the things it could do , from cutting wire to stripping down vines and cleaning fish . I had my .45 and one extra clip , and that was something I could use in what I needed to do ; wanted to do , you might even say . It was one of those kind of times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Colonel and everybody else used to tell us . That was all right with me . In the building we were going by there were plenty of doors , some that shut on the street and some that went back a ways . I was interested in the deep ones , and I looked along the left for what I wanted . There was hardly any sidewalk , and I could be in one of the doorways in two pushes and one big step , or two at the most . There were a couple of men in the crowd now , on the side I was edging toward . They were ahead of me , but one of them was about my size , and I figured that there would be more than one to come along later , when I was ready . And I had noticed something else . A lot of people , even the babies , had things , some kind of bandages , over their noses and mouths , like doctors in hospitals ; like some of the ones at the base hospital at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trench mouth I got from eating GI food ; I used to see them go by the ward . That would help , not only now but later on . The officers in indoctrination , in the course we had to take called The Nature of the Enemy , told us that a lot of Japanese wore those things all the time , even when they were not in an air raid .  | And , again , I knew that would help , and that there was more advantage I could give myself once I had picked out the door . And there it was , so deep it might have been an alley . I slid and slanted and jumbled over through the women , and then made my two steps , one big and the other more or less ordinary , and I was in . I backed up some more to get the shadow , and got it all , all I could use . There was plenty of time now . Plenty of time , and good conditions . I felt my face . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oxygen mask fits a lot better that way , and my beard had n't even begun to grow out . But that was not what I was thinking . I ran my fingers along the wood next to me and looked at them , and the tips were black ; the smoke had sooted up everything . I took a good smear of soot off the boards and went across my forehead with it , then more down my cheeks and nose and around my mouth . As the color of my face disappeared and went to another color , there was something inside me that changed , too . It moved , and then sat still . In my mind there was a shape I could n't exactly make out , but it seemed to he in a crouch , pulled up into itself and ready , and that was the feeling I got from the soot , the stronger the more I put on . I did the back of my hands the same way , and then concentrated on the crowd going by , screaming and moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a look toward me . Millions of them could have gone by , and none of them would have seen me . I was dark now , the same as the shadow I was in . Some of the people were pretty smudged up , too , but I had not made myself like them in any way ; it was just that now I would n't stand out . I was not like them , I say again ; like something else . I had another thought . Working with little moves , I pulled out the blood chit , the silk handkerchief with the American flag  | on it , and all the languages ? Japanese was one of them , which I could n't get over ? that said that my aircraft was destroyed , I was an enemy of the Japanese , that my government would pay anybody who 'd help me . I turned the flag and the writing to the inside and tied it around the lower part of my face . Almost everybody I saw had on a mask or cloth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zipped down the flight suit and took the .45 out of the holster . I hit the clip with the heel of my other hand to make sure it was seated , and then let the safety off and charged it , and at the same time I brought the crouching shape up front in my mind , and had what it wanted me to have . There was not a flicker of light on the gun barrel . I put my free hand on the wood next to me to get steady , and all at once it jumped and shook . I figured the second story had caught fire , or somewhere up above me had , but I could n't see for the smoke . On the other side of the street the fire had already come down to the ground floor ; l could tell by the crowd edging toward me . In there amongst the people , and close to me , I looked for my size . About five yards from me a man , I think , went down . The crowd went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could make it to his feet somebody else tripped over him , and this time neither one got up . Out of the smoke another man stumbled , and in a second I knew he was about right , about what I needed . For some reason the two that should have been on the ground were not there , maybe had been shoved off to one side by all that panic , all that pressure , but the one I had my eye on was still stumbling where they had been , correcting , you might say , trying to get his feet all the way under him , and I let him have a couple more steps . He came right to me , like every animal or bird I 'd ever shot , or like the Nip fighters sliding  | down the string of the pursuit curve . If you want to kill something , have it coming toward you . If it comes without knowing you 're there , it 's the best way of all . I stood up in the doorway and came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , at the same level as mine . I did n't want any blood on the clothes , or any holes . The sound of the gun was hardly any louder than the general noise , and the muzzle flame was just one more little bit of fire , exactly like all the rest of it , and gone quicker than you could think . The blast knocked him back , the shock ? a .45 at close range is like a hand-held 30.06 ? and he went down , with the two or three other people behind him . I doubled into a crouch , watching hard . The others scrambled back into the crowd and left him , all but one guy who pulled him to the side , and then moved with the others again . The clothes I wanted were lying about half under the feet of the people on my side of the street . I lc had been dragged a yard or two by his feet , and I could n't see his head ; the others were swarming all over him , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .45 , stepped out , and then went down on my knees amongst all those feet ; they were going by me like they were going by the dead man . I took him by an arm and a leg and hiked him up on my shoulders , like I was maybe going to carry him on with the rest of the crowd , wherever they were going . But all I did was take two or three steps and lurch back into my door , then rolled him off and rolled down beside him . I stayed there still as I could , then reached a hand . The building was roaring over us , and pieces of wood , some of them big and heavy , were falling faster and faster , and I thought that maybe the whole thing was going to come down on us in the next few seconds . I hoisted up to my knees and took hold of the  | middle of myself , under the throat , pulled down the zipper in one sweep , came out of the flight suit in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy 's coat and shirt . They were all right by feel ; even wearing them over my dungarees was not too tight . The pants were good enough , too , but the shoes were too short . I could n't come near getting one of them on , sitting in the door frame now like I was doing , not too much different from the way I would have back in the Quonset hut . I stood up and took one last look at the guy . The top half of his head was gone , but with the fire flickering on him and the ground smoke swirling in and out of the door , he did n't look too bad right then . His hat had been blown off with his head , so I would have to do without it , but I had a crew cut anyway , and my hair is black , so it did n't make all that much difference . It would not be a bad idea to have a hat later on , and some other shoes , but I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The building was going to go any second , I was sure . I balled my flight suit up and flung it into the fire . Nobody was going to look at my feet . Breathing through the blood chit , the American flag , I stepped out . It did n't take me long to pick up the kind of shuffle-stumble the crowd was moving with , screaming and moaning . For some reason all of us turned a corner , away from the docks , and just as we did there was a crash inside all the other noises ? a terrific crash inside the big moaning sound the whole city must have been making ? and a building fell in . Whether it was the one I had been in I ca n't say , and it does n't make any difference , but I think it probably was . People kept shoving in from the side streets , and we were pushed closer and closer together . It was hard enough to breathe through the smoke , but all that being pressed on made it a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | any doubt that I could raise my feet up off the ground and the rest of them would just carry me along . It would be better for me to work myself out to the near edge , on the side I had come in from , but still stay amongst them , and not separate myself out , even if I 'd been able to . I managed it , and could breathe better . There was only a little fat woman between me and the buildings , and a short , screaming man in front . Whoever was behind me I did n't need to know . Over the knife and the emergency kit and the .45 , I had on somebody 's old shirt and coat . They were loose and comfortable . The pants fit all right , too , but they had a pocket only on the right side and no pockets in the back . I was holding the extra clip for the gun in my hand , and I put it in the pocket , which was deep , real deep . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some before I cleared the city . Shoes , and a bag like the ones a lot of people in the crowd were carrying . I was going to have to take everything I needed with me , and when I got out of the fire and into the cold , I 'd have to be able to keep warm enough to stay alive . But even when I got to the real cold ? the cold like the Brooks Range ? I would n't need clothes as heavy as most people would have to wear . Still , it would be better if I could find some heavier than the ones I had on . Actually , I looked forward to getting hold of a parka somewhere ; that would be like home , sure enough . As I shuffled along with the little screaming people , breathing through the blood chit , the American flag , my eyes almost shut with smoke , I thought about the parka . I 'd like it to be one with wolverine fur around the head , because ice does n't hold to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off . I did n't have any idea whether there were any parkas in Japan , but if people lived in the northern part , on the big island  | the map said was up above the one where I was , they 'd have to have the clothes for it . And if there were animals up there , they 'd have to have fur , and the humans would 've found a way to get it . But wolverines ? Again , I did n't know . Wolverine fur was maybe too much to hope for , but it was n't costing me anything to think about it , or how I would get it if I found it . I had n't counted on any of the other stuff that had happened , either : that my B-29 would get the ass knocked off it , or that I would bail out , get hung up on a crane , or that I would hide in a sewer pipe full of half the shit in Tokyo , or shoot somebody for his pants and coat , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep from being burned up by American incendiaries . So . . . who knows , I said to myself . Who knows I wo n't find a wolverine parka up north of here . Who could want anything better ? I thought of my father then , too . He was good for me ; he had taught me everything I knew , until I was old enough to teach him . The day that happened was the best day of my life , I can tell you . It was not when I took off my snowshoes and ran the flat of the valley , but the day I put them back on , and knew there was going to be nothing but snow for a long time . I had n't been keeping track of the direction of the mob I was in , but just moved along with the others . After a while , though , I started to notice something I could n't see any reason for . The crowd seemed to know where it was going , like way off in front there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see how that would be possible , but there seemed to be a general direction we were headed in . Twice buildings fell in front of us , one no more than fifty or sixty yards off , and both times we turned into another street , and then back toward the way we had been headed . I thought we might be trying to get out of the  | city , but we just went on and on , and the buildings on both sides were just as close together as they had been down by the docks . And then things changed all at once . The wind was steady now , coming from behind us , like it was pushing us along . The smoke was as bad as ever , but it blew forward , past me . People stepped away from both sides , and I could tell that the shape of the crowd that had been made by the streets and buildings was not the shape any longer . There was not a whole lot more room , but there was some : nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of others , but they had fanned out , as near as I could tell , and they were moving a little faster , like something they had been looking for was in sight . I could n't figure how any of this could be , or how any of them could see any better than I could , so I fell back on what I could hear , and tried to tune in on any new sound coming through that low , long moaning that just went on and on . Sure enough , there was something . I thought it could n't be what it sounded like , but when I saw the man in front of me get shorter and shorter , and not fall , I knew that he was moving downward , and that he was walking into water . I followed him down , and in . The water was not much cooler than the air , but the crowd had quit moving , most of them . The people around me were just standing and screaming . If they had walked into that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but stand there and scream as loud as they could , for money or some prize , they could n't have ( lone it any better , or any louder , or got more breath out of all that smoke to keep it up like they did . I waded through them , with the idea that the water farther out might not be as hot . Some of them were trying to hold the others up ? not all these were kids , either ? and some were trying to push the others   down and get on top of them . There were piles of people everywhere . They 'd build up a little and then everything would fall apart and go under water . I did n't believe that many of them could swim , but some of them were moving out from the shore like I was , hoping for water the fire was n't so close to . The water was about up to the middle of my chest when I stepped in a hole and went under . I came right back up , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something , a woman , in front of me , and not turned the same way I was . She was looking right at me , right into my face . I felt myself : the blood chit had come down and was around my neck . The soot had maybe washed off me , too , or most of it . It was the first face I had looked at since I 'd bailed out , and the first person who had looked at me close up . Even through the smoke there was plenty of light , and she could n't believe what she was looking at ; my face must have been real pale in all that red glow . Her mouth opened and she screamed , and started to raise her hand to point . She did scream , but the sound was not any different from all the others , and she did n't scream but once . Under water I ran the knife into her with my move . The blade hit bone and traveled around it , and the only thing that stopped my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it back in the case , and was holding her down pretty hard as quick as anybody could have done it . But after a second or two I could tell there was not any reason to hold her down , and I turned loose and moved on , pulling the chit up where it belonged . The water was not cooler , no matter where I went . When it got up to my chin I stopped ; there was no use to swim , just to be swimming . Besides , I was worried about the .45 . I might be able to use it again before it had a chance to rust , but I had better do it in the next hour or so . The bullets were probably all right , but  | I was n't sure about them , either . If I had to depend on a gun , I wanted to know that it would fire when I used it . If it would n't , or even if there was any doubt , I would get rid of it and use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I would n't rather do that , anyway . Not having a gun would n't bother me at all . I would n't miss it nearly as much as I would have the knife , or the compass , or even the fishhooks . I started working back through the stacks of people , and the ones just standing and screaming , toward the shore , and the crowd who thought that water would do them any good . I had got used to panic . It was what I had wanted when I was in the pipe , and was what I had to go on from the Colonel 's briefing , and all his talk about what three hundred 29S were going to do to Tokyo , as he said , within a week . I remembered my time in the pipe , and the Tokyo shit going past where I was hunkered down thinking about the caribou clearing the tree line into the winter range , and the ice calving off the berg in a slide , freeing up that blue window that did n't have anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice , a color that 's not anywhere but there , I would bet anything on earth ? all that time , all that time hunkered down in the pipe , with the shit going past me and falling into the bay , I had been pulling for the fire raid , the firestorm , and the panic . Wading out of the water now ? the bay or lake or river or whatever it was ? I felt that panic , that whole city-panic , and in the water it was different from what it was in the streets and the smoke . It was heavy-electric ? and to tell the truth , I do n't know what I mean by this , but it was a feeling , and maybe one of those that do n't have words ? and in the legs : in my legs but it felt good , coming from all those other people . It was in the guts and the balls , and that was the best of all .  | While I was in the water , I did n't do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore it was like having to get out of bed when you do n't want to : sleep holds to you , and your position and your feeling is so good that it seems wrong to change it . But I needed shoes . I needed some shoes like theirs , and a bag , and I started to think again . It did n't bother anybody that I was moving the opposite way from the others , going toward the fire . I probably did n't need to , but I stumbled a little , even waved my arms like I was drunk , or maybe like the fire had got me in the lungs , or that the whole thing , the firestorm , was more than I could cope with and had driven me off my nut . I went face-forward through the crowd coming toward the water , going back to the main smoke and the fire like I 'd lost something there ? something or somebody , some damned thing . I made it back into the streets , went up a block through the bunches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This time there was hardly anybody there , maybe because it was so goddamned hot , hotter than anywhere else I 'd been . While I could , I figured to blacken up again , and I did , from the closest house to me , just wherever I happened to be . I took my time and made myself up pretty good ? better than before , if I do say so . I did n't need to see a mirror ; I could feel how thick the stuff was on my face and hands , how heavy it was , how much of it I put on me . I kept slathering on the black , the soot ; I kept putting on the smoke . It was like getting back into something I knew , something that was right for me , only a lot better version of it than before . All I needed now was shadows , because I was as much like them as I could ever have wanted to he : shadows I needed . I would get the shoes from them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes this way and that  | way up the street . But the pipe kept coming back to me . I could n't shake it , or the feeling that what I had said there , said to myself , and on out the black-blue opening of the sewer out into the ocean , had been picked up , picked up by the crews and everybody who was connected with putting those B-29s up there over the town . I had called for that fire from a place where I was as good as buried . I had called that fire down . Damn right . If I did n't , who did ? I kept looking for people , for somebody with fair-sized feet and a bag . It was so hot that it was just possible to stand it . I thought that maybe if it got any hotter my clothes would burn , wet as they were . But nothing like that happened , and I started forward into the smoke and the bad ? the worst ? heat because I figured I could catch somebody there who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get away . That was the right street , if I could stand it . ' Ile buildings on the left were burning worse than the right - my black left hand was a lot hotter than my right ? and all at once , like some acrobat ? a clown maybe ; clumsy , but an acrobat ? a man shot out of a second-story window on the right , went across the street over me , and crashed through a window on the other side . Nobody will believe this , but it happened . In all the noise and smoke this guy just appeared in a blast of sparks like about fifty shotguns at midnight , like the kind of thing you see made into slow motion by a movie , and went right over the street into another building . The window he went through buried him in sparks ? other sparks , but the one . I ca n't get over the way that happened : he turned over in air , like he was just learning how to do it , and then hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really went . For a second it was slow , when he made the turnover , but really how  | he moved was fast , real fast and interesting , unexpected . It was not something you 'd see every day . Hurtled would be the word ; I ca n't do any better . I went on under where he had been , and I could n't help smiling , under the chit , the American flag , when I caught myself looking up , to see whether there 'd be any more coming over : the rest of the act , the other guy shot out of the building , the gun . Gun , you bet , that was it : coming over me in the sparks of a shotgun . It was bad , though . I thought about heading back , maybe picking up another street , but the good happened , right then . Two guys , one bigger than me and one smaller , came toward me . The clothes of the little one looked like they might have been on fire . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm was burning . I let him go by , and then stepped out right in front of the other one . It was important to do it that way , with just him and me . I pulled the .45 and leveled it right into his chest . Shoes , you son of a bitch . Shoes . I squeezed off . Nothing happened . I did n't even bother to try again . I was on him with the knife in a second , hit him once and hit him right , and was already dragging him before he was dead . I wiped the knife off on his pants and unlaced his shoes and mine , sitting there in the shadows cooking , both of us , like meat not quite close enough to the fire to get done . But it was not bad , either , in a way . There was something coming through me that the fire could n't touch , and a lot of times later on I 've thought about it , remembering that it was true ; I 'd been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? of a street , pulling on the shoes that were going to walk all over hell , and walk right out of it , and on ? and on and on , up into the snow . I wanted that tree line , I wanted that move into the winter range  | with the caribou . There never had been such real snow as was in my mind right then , pulling on those shoes . Snow , man , I said : snow and the North Star , Polaris . Snow and the icebergs , and the ocean when it 's what it really is , like I had told the guy , the recruit in the barracks . The ocean is not the ocean unless ifs got ice in it . That 's the real one . And that 's the truth . I stood up to see whether the guy had anything else I could use . I had forgotten about the bag I needed , but damned if he did n't have one , a fairly big one . There was nothing in it but some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a short knife with a long handle , which I did n't figure to use but kept anyway . I put my GI boots in the bag , picked up the waterlogged .45 , and pitched it and the extra clip into the fire . I was glad to see them go , to tell the truth . I went on up the same street . It had had what I needed , and I pushed on , though the heat was so terrific that I did n't really see how anybody could live . I did n't hear any more bombs , and figured the raid was over . Tokyo did n't need any more fire , and probably would n't see any more until the end of everything . It was so hot that I kept looking at the arms of the coat I had on to sec when they 'd take fire . And then it got hotter , goddamn it , and hotter than that . I did n't think my clothes would catch ; I did n't think that anymore then . I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the clothes , shoes and all , would burn up after I did . I'he street ended in a wall , and that 's what saved me , I guess , because I would have gone on . I know I would have . A strange thing to say , but I was more or less happy with what I had , and the thing that made me the happiest was that I had got rid of the .45 and the clips , and that I had an excuse for getting rid of them . At the wall I turned to the right , which I figure was  | more or less north . The pull that way was not real strong then , but it was definite . I could have checked the compass , I guess , but I went by the feel . Like I say , it was definite ; the smoke and fire could n't touch it . I moved along for a couple of blocks and things got cooler . I sat down in my singed clothes and my new shoes and opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The knife was a pretty little knife , there in the flicker . The handle was long , and with a kind of string weave around it , and there was carving at the end of it . It was strange , though . For such a short blade , the handle was a lot too long . It was more like the handle that should have been on a sword ? one of their swords that they swing with both hands ? instead of a blade that size . The steel was stiff , which I did n't like , but the blade was so short that flex probably would n't have done any good : you need a long blade for flex to do its stuff . I had put down two people with my bread knife , like I knew I could , and neither one of them had made a sound , or at least any that I could hear . That ought to tell you something . I moved on through the streets , according to the pull and the feeling . I guessed some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . As near as I could tell , I was working crossways through the main push of people , all of them going for the water . It made sense to them , I guess , though I 'd reckon as many drowned as were burned up . The water seemed to turn them against each other , and a lot of them held the other ones down and tried to get on top for a second . That was a bad mistake , I could have told them ? those poor bastards trying to stand on top of their own kids , just for one more breath of smoke . What if they 'd got it ? I was surprised at how tired I was , there on another street , and then another one . I knew I had better get out of the city and hole up somewhere , because I felt the worst of the panic , the  | part that was best for me , more or less begin to die out ? felt it from where I was now and I thought that maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You watch any animal hunt ? look at a lynx , for one and they come right out of sleeping into hunting . That 's the time to do it . You do n't want any tiredness to get into it , because it all has to happen so fast . I wanted that quick , that quickness . I wanted the quick whenever I could get it . But I sat down again anyway , and opened the bag . The instrument , whatever it was , was round , round as a wheel , and the strings , which were real tight , caught the fire , caught off the flames in the low part of the building I was sitting against , and I thought , what the hell , why not see what the thing sounds like . So I hit one of the strings and bent over to listen to it . You 'd have thought I was caught up in the way the thing rang , in a low way , off those black bricks and boards , and there might have been something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string , and then the next one to it , and then both of them together . You could tell at that was not the way they were supposed to sound ? or I ore or less supposed that anybody who knew would be able to hell , , because I had not ever heard anything like it , quite . It was any kind of noise , and it had something in it if I can put it like this ? that was like the singing somebody would make way back in his mouth , between his throat and his nose . It was like that except the person would have to be young , like a kid , like a real young girl . Well , I hit all the strings at once , one after the other , and this time it bothered me , because it was a sound ? whether it was music or somebody 's voice , or maybe more than ? t hat did n't go anywhere ; it just hung there and made you dissatisfied . I put the thing in the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably tool with it again , somewhere between  | me and the snow , and that maybe it would not be such a good thing to be doing , so I took it out and leaned it against the place I 'd been sitting , to add one more thing to the night , one more thing that there would n't be any way to explain . There were going to be a lot of things like that in Tokyo after the fire quit burning . But it would have been the strangest of all , I reckon , if somebody had seen me sitting there in the smoke , twanging on that little white wheel . They would have told the others , maybe ? whoever lived ? but nobody would 've believed it . Or maybe somebody would have . Like they say , it was one of those nights . I got up and went on , and I wo n't say that I did n't make , or try to make , somewhere in my throat , something like that last sound , the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and maybe all girls . They were in me somewhere , and would n't have been there except for that little wheel with the strings on it , round as a full moon , with a rack of tin along through it . I could n't get that sound , but I could hear it . I knew it was there , and maybe I 'd get it later on , when I went through the tree line , or saw the ocean with ice in it that made the whole thing the truth , as real as it could get . It had been night so long , in some places with fire bright as day , that I had got used to the idea that there was n't going to be anything else . But in the way I was going , the fires were definitely less than they 'd been ? less bunched up , less high , and less hot . I kept moving according to my gut feel , even though I had to jog this way and that way amongst the streets . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all just like each other .  | Nobody said a thing to me , and my main trouble was in trying to look as confused and aimless as they did while I held on to my heading . The smoke was still bad , and there was no way I could get a look at the sky . It was probably clear , if I could 've seen it . The 295 had cracked down and hit the city where they wanted to , and must 've had all the visibility they wanted . But for me there was n't any sky , yet . I checked the compass , and I had been right , more or less ; my guts had been right . Sailors and Eskimos have the same thing , and it 's probably stronger with them than it is with anybody . But the hunters are next , next to the sailors and Eskimos , who are next to the fish and the birds . As well as I could , I kept looking through the smoke to the cast , to see where there might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A new situation had come up for me now , as I got clear of the worst of the raid and most of the heat . I had to decide whether I wanted to stay amongst people ? whatever people I could find ? and work north , maybe , from one group to another , or more or less to go along by myself . The worst thing that could happen would be for somebody to say something to me , because there was no way I 'd ever be able to make ? m ? kind of an answer . If I grouped with people , that might happen . No , it was bound to happen . But if I kept to myself I would stand out , and would have to depend on my clothes and the blood chit , and on getting away from anybody who came up me . I decided to stay with people for as long as I could , not th small groups but with the largest ones I could find headnorth out of town . Groups had paid off for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation in which everybody was con-d and scared to death . I still had panic going for me , and thought I probably should use it till it ran out and I had to something else .  | I was almost clear of the main city now . The fires were low ? you could have stomped some of them out with your feet ? and the smoke not nearly as thick . Instead of the houses being jammed up on each other , and all burning , there were some now with spaces between them , and not all of them were on fire . But I had never seen such an arrangement of houses in my life . Even an Eskimo village would not have been so weird to somebody who had never seen one before . The houses were little and squarish , and the yards , as near as I could tell , were kept up pretty well . But between every three or four houses was a Nip fighter aircraft sitting in somebody 's yard like a car would 've been back in the States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had some way the fighters could taxi down the streets and on out to the strip , wherever it was : some easy way to the strip , because there were sure a lot of fighters . Walking past the houses and the planes , which I got clear of after a while , I was with a small group of women , two with little kids , and three old men . I kept my head down , and decided that if one of them said anything to me , I would just mumble and shake my head , like all my words had been struck out of me , or burned out by the fire . The squatty woman right ahead of me was carrying her little girl on her back , and she did n't seem to be bothered at all . I would look at the road for a minute , and then , in the low fires that were still around us , at the little girl , and her look was always there , waiting for my eyes to come up from the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hers aga in . I must say she was very pretty ; with those bangs , nobody could have invented a Jap doll that 'd be any prettier . We must have gone on a couple of miles that way , and all the time the panic was leaving the people I was with . I thought that when more of it left they would begin to talk , and I hoped to be able to pick tip  | a word or two and memorize it before any of them said anything to me . If the worst happened , I could handle this bunch , and maybe even without having to kill any of them . I did n't want any of that to happen , war or no war . This was not the time for it . I drew in what was there . I drew in a lot of breath , and I could have it . I could have it . That 's the way it struck me : I could have it without gagging and coughing . I straightened up . I took my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and looked east . There was orange there . It showed through the smoke , but it was damned well orange , and not fire , and it was big . Not the sun , the Fireball Mail yet , but just before . The Rising Sun , I thought . I 'm in just the place for it . The Rising Sun . There it was , sure enough . And if I could see the sun , I ought to be able to see the other sky , too : the last of the stars . I was almost afraid to look north , but I did . The Dipper was there , canted way up , and Polaris was there , off the two front stars . I pulled out the compass , and the needle and the star trued up . I grinned at the baby , right into those bangs . It was nice . It was all right there . But I left them , and walked on by myself . There was almost no traffic on the road . Every now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that looked like a jeep ? going away from town , but I did n't see more than two or three civilian cars , or even more than a few bicycles . You 'd have thought that people would be getting into everything that would run and heading out , but it might have been that the crowds in the streets kept anything from getting through , or maybe most of the cars in town were burned up ? I saw the gasoline in at least one blow sky-high , with somebody in it ? were where the people they belonged to could n't get to  | them . Anyway , I had to give up any idea I might 've had about a ride , either by stealing a car or truck or by stowing away in a heavy hauler with a tarp in the back . I might do something like that later , if I could , but it was not going to be possible for a while . I had to walk . The light was coming now . The sky was clear . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I began leaving the dream of all that heat , that night with all the crowds and white phosphorus in it , and the shithole of the pipe , and the water where whole families killed each other for one more breath of smoke . I say dream , and not nightmare , because I did n't think about it that way . Sure , it was bad enough , the worst heat I was ever in , and the firestorm killed a lot of people ; I did n't know how many , but it must have been in the thousands . But for me there were things that were worse , things that I reckon you could say would be like nightmares . Not having a weapon was one of them , and being in a situation I did n't have any control over would be another . But that had n't happened yet . In the aircraft , when it was hit , I got out because I had taped the chute to the bulkhead . I had got down off the gantry and into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , and now I had got clear of the city , and the night was over . The night , not the nightmare . A dream , maybe . But if you say night - mare to me , you do n't mean a fire raid on Tokyo . You 'd have t be talking about something else . More light came , and now you could see the sun behind the houses . I looked at the backs of my hands , which were as filthy black as I could have wanted , and I knew my face was the same , or maybe even blacker . But the people I had looked at , the ones I had walked out with , even though they were pretty smudged up and streaked up , were not ? not one ? as black as I was ,  | and I was afraid that the job I had done with soot from the buildings was maybe too good , and might make me stand out even more than I would have if I had n't done it . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with no fire and hardly any smoke and no panic around me : last night 's big city-panic that felt like the breath of life to me , in all that smoke . There was a lot of weight in my body now . I was tired and I had to find a way to get some rest . My black face began to bother me more and more , and I did what I could to streak it with my fingers , but I was not sure that that would n't make me even more strange looking , make me stand out more , and that was the last thing I wanted . But still , nobody said anything to me . I kept my head down , thanking God that my hair is dead black and that I had it cut almost as short as the Japs ' . I felt like that was part of my luck . But I was nervous right then . I 'll tell you the truth , I was . I was between plans , and I needed to move on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a time I would n't want to go through again . I tried not to get the full force of where I was : the whole , real situation . Even though I had been through the firestorm the B-29s had made , the idea of the war ? of any war ? had more or less left me when I was in there shoving through the streets with the people trying to get out , or in the water with them , or even when I had hit the three of them I 'd killed . War was in back of the things I 'd done , sure , but when I 'd done them , the war did n't seem to have anything to do with it . I was not carrying out anybody 's orders , that 's for sure . But now the war ? the idea , the fact , of the war ? came back , and for the first time , really , I admitted to myself the worst I could , which was also the truth . I went over the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home country . Everybody was my ene-67  | my . Even if there had been one person in Japan friendly toward me , one who would do anything to help me , there was no way for me to find him . I did n't have any way to speak to anybody , even to tell him I would kill him if he did n't do what I said . I had tried to pick up a word or two from the crowds , and thought I had one there for a while , but I forgot it ; and anyway , I did n't know what it meant . I needed a few words , just a few , and I needed to know what they meant . There must be ways I could work this out , but I did n't know them yet . Right now I was hungry and tired , though the little chill was just right for me ; if I could find a place to lie down , I would sleep for a long time . And I had two high-energy candy bars in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would eat them when I woke up and got going again . But in every direction , in everybody I saw or who saw me , death was there . My own death was all around me , and there would be a lot of torture connected with it . Everywhere I looked there was beating , fire torture , mutilation , castration . Getting my head chopped off would be the easiest part . What did I have , myself ? I started outside and worked in . I had my knife , still right where it should be , and the emergency kit ; I had what I had brought with me . In the kit I had a compass , fishhooks and twine , and a little short blade . I had a silk map of the area , like a handkerchief , though it only showed up to the tip of Honshu , the Tokyo island . I sat down behind a low wall between houses and took it out and looked at it . Hokkaido , the northern island , where I wanted to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very top of the map , but there was one place between the two islands that was fairly narrow , about fifteen or twenty miles , as I judged , and I might he able to get across there in a night , if I could find a boat . ' They  | had told us in briefing that fishing was a big thing in Japan , and I figured there would be all kinds of boats , because there is always a lot of fishing when two islands are close together , no matter where they are , if people live on them . That was the outside stuff . I did n't have anything in the bag but my issue shoes and the short-handled knife , and I did n't think of anything in the bag as being nearly as important as what I had on me . Or in me . It 's harder to think about that than it is about knives and fishhooks and maps , but when I got down to it I started to feel better , a lot better . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do . Sure , I did n't know everything I 'd do , but I did n't feel like I had any limits on me when the right situation came up . Like I say , I had something that did n't have any limits on it . I would do what many another would n't , and the best thing was that I knew I would do it ; there was n't any doubt . It was funny . The idea of the war came back in with this other thinking , but it came in in a different way , not on the bad side but the good . I looked up over the wall to get a fix on somebody , some other person , and make a kind of concentration that way , but there was only an old man walking by , up the road , with an old woman about ten feet behind him , all bent over with carrying a bundle of sticks and logs that looked to be about as big as she was . They would do , though ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducked back down : this is my war as much as it is theirs ; what they can do to me I can do to them . But I had to admit to myself that that notion did n't come through to me with the power that it ought to have had , that it probably would have with somebody else . No . The war was there , and I 'd have to deal with certain things connected with it , certain situations , and they 'd come up . But the war was not the main thing . It might have been to them , to the others , to the  | Japs , but not to me . There did n't need to be any war . There were not any rules , except the ones I made . Everything would ride on that . The north was the big thing I wanted : the biggest there could be . When I got out of the Air Force , if I ever did , I planned to go back up there as soon as I could , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even behind the twin fifties in the tail of a B-29 , where I was pretty good , if I do say so myself . But you ca n't live there . I did n't belong anywhere , really , but above seventy degrees north , on the north slopes of mountains like the Brooks Range . And , I said to myself , what is the difference between going there after the war and going there now ? like I say , however I could get there ? Snow fields are all the same . Snow in the air and on the ground is the same , and water is the same , and ice in the water is the same . Ice , big ice , which is the best . But ice , and the same . And there was another thing that came from there . I had n't lived most of my life up above seventy degrees for nothing . There were things you could do . Up there , some things were natural , part of the skin and feathers and fur and eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish . And there were ways that you could do what they did , not by being natural but by thinking about it , by figuring what might work : what might keep anything , anybody , from seeing you , and ways in which you could stay in that situation till whatever it was went by . And ways , too , you could come out of it : come out on their blind side and be on them and done with them before they ever knew you were anywhere around , or even if you were in the world . I hid seen the snowshoe hare lie down , lie down in a bunch of low bushes , and make an outline of himself . First there 's an outline in the snow , and then there 's not any outline . I 've seen that . " I he  | only thing left is the eyes , and I 've seen the hare close his eyes , and I could have walked over the place where he was , and unless I stepped on him I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world , either . Most of the time I never saw the hare close his eyes , and I could n't find him . But once or twice ? once , to be honest , when the hare was in open snow and not in any bushes ? I saw the eyes closing , I saw the whole thing , the whole disappearance . I 've seen that ; that 's what I had . I had it . I was there with it . And I 've seen the lynx work , too , with his long legs moving slow , not wanting to touch the snow crust but going over it just the same . I 've seen him move through dead limbs , and the shadow spots on his sides would make you think that the limbs of the trees , the bushes and twigs , were moving too , going somewhere without breaking the snow . You could do that , I told myself down beside the wall . You could do it ; you can do it . You can use the snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one thing . One . You need the color of the place you 're in . Even in the big rush of good feeling , when the colors came over me and I felt like I could be any of them , any time of the day or night : when I felt like I could lie down in green or yellow , in purple or red , in the moonlight or the sunrise , and I could stay until I got ready to get up and go on , and nobody would know , or fa I I out of any of them , like a hawk : fall on somebody 's back , or right into his face like a blaze of light flashing through him , or doing anything I wanted , I knew that it was only part of the truth , only part of the truth that would be , from here on . There would be lots of colors between me here and the snow fields there , between me and the ocean and the bergs , and there was not any way I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? this wall ? and where I was trying to get to . 71  | But there would be long stretches ? there were bound to be long stretches ? where the color was more or less the same , and if that was true , I could find some way to tap in on it , take advantage of it , make it work for me . If there were colors in Japan , if there were colors in the world , I could go with them ; I could get into them , be with them , be what they were . I could , damn it : I sure could . When I came on a long stretch of color ? stayed in it for a day , maybe ? I would try to make the best way to do it for the next day . But right now , with the air clearing , and people coming out of the panic , I had to deal with the right now . More than anything else , I needed to be able to come up with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I needed to get where I could hear people talk , and pick up the thing they said the most , no matter what it was . The Tokyo raid was bad news , and anything I heard would most likely have to do with it . There might be plenty of other things to talk about , but it seemed to me that if I heard sounds out of people , and some of them were the same , then they would almost have to do with the raid . I could keep to my black , tarbaby look for a little while , and my head-low mumbling , and myself as somebody who had been so hard hit , so burned , so fucked up by the raid that I could n't say anything anybody could make out . I could do it long enough to get a couple of words , maybe half a sentence that I could use , and then use it when I had to , keep going on and on with , over and over , like a man made into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wanted people to feel sorrier for me than they did for themselves . That would help , until I got to the colors . At night I would look over the colors : the color where I was , and then get ready to go through it , go through it to the next one .  | I decided to stick to the roads as long as I was let alone . The sun was up good now , but we still had the chill . I looked out over the wall . Three or four little women were walking toward me , but not looking in my direction , and I went around the end of the wall and , when they went by , fell in a few steps behind them . One of them turned her head , but I saw that she was going to do it , and I put my eyes onto my shoes as they went along . " Taihen , taihen , " one of them said . I went over it in my mind . When another one said it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . I stumbled and made like I was going to fall , and the same one who had looked before , looked back , but did n't do anything . We walked on , and she said the same thing . She said it : " Taihen , taihen . " I went over it again , and again . None of them looked back , and I was gone . Whether it was food first , or sleep , I did n't much care . The farther I went , though , the more sleep came to me , came forward at me . I had been tired out on the Range , on the snowshoes , when I could hardly lift one off the snow and put the next one in front of it , but in some ways this was just as bad . I kept looking for somebody who was as tired as I was , and who nobody was bothering : some poor guy , an old guy maybe , lying in a ditch , who nobody cared about . I would have gone down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come up on me , but that was not really the kind of sleep I wanted . Some sort of hole , I thought , some dark place . But where was there anything like that around ? The road was open , and in another half mile went up among some hills , but that did n't do me any good , none that I could see from where I was . I went over my word ? taihen ? or maybe it was a couple of words , and tried to make them like I remembered the sound , but I did n't have any real confidence . I went on , toward the hills and  | what looked like it might be a little bunch of stores , just where the land started to climb . When I got next to the buildings there was a crash , something that sounded like a crash of glass , and that 's what it was . A bunch of women were breaking the window of the store , and I waited to see if there would be anything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , right through the splinters , and in a minute they were throwing things out to the others . I eased up to the bunch catching the stuff , but did n't make any try to get what was coming out ; I thought I might go in when the rest of them left . Finally they did leave , and I went in . There was not much , but I found some rice in a bowl and parts of a fish ? the head , too ? like you might feed to a cat . I ate it , all I could get , and licked the inside of the bowl . Right then a woman ? maybe one of the women who had broken the glass ? came back in and grabbed me by the coat . I turned around with my hand going across me , ready to come up through her if I had to , but there were eight or ten others behind her , and I mumbled my word ? mumbled my words , mumbled something ? put my head down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me clear of the store , and not one of them got a good look at me . I was pretty sure of that , because they all kept screaming at me , and I could more or less tell that it was the same kind of way they would have treated any bum . I did n't mind all that much . I had got a little something to eat , and even while they were kicking me and beating me any way they could , the fish and rice were doing good , and after I was on the road again , I felt like I had got hold of some new blood , a transfusion or something . With some sleep on top of that , I could make it a long way . I went around the first turn up off the flat , looking for a ditch  | or bushes . There was some scrub and weeds , but nothing deep , nothing dark . There was junk along the side of the road ? paper boxes and a can or two ? and all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving in the orange sun that was getting higher and turning yellow . They had told us that Orientals did n't have any respect for life , and would n't even help a man who fell down sick in the street , or who they just came up on , lying out in a field or in somebody 's yard , but there was not anything like that where I was walking . And then there was . I saw the sun , very yellow now , not at all orange anymore , slant up and off glass , which just as soon as I looked was a bottle , and beside it an old man was either dead or unconscious or asleep . I stood off from him and waited for some other people to come by , to see how much attention they would pay him . I sat down like I had some business with him , my head down on my knees . Every now and then somebody would walk past . I would look up just enough to watch them pass by , but nobody even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bright winter sunlight now , bright and yellow , and I got the feeling , stronger and stronger , that nobody gave a damn who I was or why I was there . The old man did n't move . The most important thing about him was that he had a hat , canvas , and I took it and put it on , because it had a good brim , and it would make it easier to hide the shape of my eyes , which I could n't figure how to do anything about . But there I was , right out there in the yellow open Japanese sun , with Japanese clothes and shoes on that I 'd got from killing two people , and a hat from one who looked like he was already dead , with a bread knife and a survival kit and a bag with wet shoes in it . From under the hat I could look out a little better , and what struck me then was what I had noticed before  | but had n't thought about as much : there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The only male people I saw were little kids and old men , and that was not bad for me , not a bad sign . I wondered what they did for police , because I had n't seen any . In the trucks and jeeps there 'd been a few men in uniform , but they were in service . I did n't know what a Japanese cop might have on , but the military had the only uniforms I 'd come across . And that was good , too . Out of the smoke I could see the women better , and honest to God , I do n't understand how even the Nip men can tell one from the other . They all had flat dish faces and round shoulders ? maybe from carrying all that cordwood ? and walked with little steps , so little that I do n't see how they ever got anywhere ; a mile would 've taken them all day . I pulled the hat down , closed my eyes , and stretched out by the old man . I listened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though the day was warming up by now , brought the tree line to myself just for a minute , and then it went , and that 's all I can remember from that first day out of Tokyo . When I woke up it was chilly again ; I sucked in the air before I opened my eyes . Then I sat up , pulled the hat down low , and looked around . The old man was gone . I do n't have any idea how he left . Maybe he had n't been dead , or if he was , somebody who knew him might have found him . Either he had been alive or family had come after him . If people 'd just been cleaning up the streets , they'd 've got me , too . Or that 's the way I figured , anyway . It was coming on for night , so I 'd been down a long time . I  | was really rested . For one thing , I like to sleep on the ground , and I 'd slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you have to keep clearing rocks out from under you . I had n't felt a single rock ; I was just a little stiff . Nobody else was coming past , though there was a light in the house next to the place where I had eaten the rice and the fish . I got up and walked past it , on up into the low hills . I figured to walk all night and , if I could , go for a place to bed down that was darker and quieter . I wanted to be under something the next time : to find rocks , where there 'd be overhangs . That way , I would n't be hemmed up . I 'd have some cover , but I could scramble out either way . Always leave yourself a way out , my father used to tell me . Fight with something to your back , especially if you 're fighting more than one guy . But sleep where you can go the other way from whatever 's after you . The old man had left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it got dark enough , I uncorked it and took a long swallow , and then another one . It was like sour water , and kind of bitterish for wine , but my head began to work faster right away , and the good side of things started to show up . The nights were when I would use the roads , as much as I could . Any car would have to show a light , and I would be where they could n't see me before they could even think , before the light got anywhere near me . If people were walking on the road I could hear them , and even if I happened to run into somebody , some guy walking the other way , maybe , the advantage would be with me rather than him . I was n't worried about one guy , or even two or three of them , especially at night . I had n't seen any one person I could n't handle , and handle pretty easily . I just had to keep the situation like it was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sleep during the day . ' Those were the main things . In daylight , when-  | ever I was n't too tired , I could get off the roads and take out through the fields , or woods if I could find them . The middle part of Honshu was not supposed to have many people ? or so the briefing officer had told us ? and was even supposed to be wild , with a lot of woods and lakes , a lot of rivers . Maybe there would be some snow in the mountains , if I could get up into them . Snow , but not enough . For that I was sure I 'd have to get over onto the other island , and move due north whenever I could . It was going to take a long time . I had another shot of wine , and finished the bottle . The houses were farther apart now . The lights in them were low , like everybody was telling secrets . I started to think about another house , not one of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathed the new dark , and the cold that did n't have any smoke in it . I was going to need something heavier to wear before long . No matter how much you like the cold , it 'll still freeze you . You 've got to keep your feet warm , or the ground will get them , get your toes . And you 've got to look out for your hands or the air will make them things you ca n't use . It 's against my way of doing things to take along too much stuff , but if you 're going where I wanted to go , there are certain things you have to have . I could get by with my Tokyo shoes , and could switch off to my old GI brogans whenever I had the chance , or if I wanted to , but I needed socks . Socks and gloves . And a scarf , a heavy one . If you can find a way to keep your neck warm , it helps everything else , even your feet . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any trapper and he 'll set you straight , right quick . The farther you go , the more stuff you pick up . If I could , I wanted to get hold of a bigger bag and make myself some sort of backpack out of it , one I could also use for a sleeping bag , so 1  | could lie down anywhere and get some rest . The idea of a house , one off from the main roads , or from any road : some farmer 's or woodcutter 's place , in the fields or back amongst the hills , would be what I was looking for . I thought about the house , what would be there and how I would get it , and worked on my words . As far as I was concerned , still , the word or words I had picked up had to do with the fire raid ; with the napalm and white phosphorus ; with the people choking and scrambling in the streets and the long moaning noise that came out of them ; with the buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crashing into the building ; with the shoving and the stumbling and the smoke . All that seemed a long way off now . There were some things about it that I could hardly remember . What mattered was the road I was on , and that I could use something else to eat , and maybe some more wine . There was a house somewhere that would give me what I wanted . There was one . But it was probably two or three days off , maybe a week . That 's the way I reckoned , but the more I thought about it , the more I knew it was somewhere , and that I 'd find it , one way or the other . I wondered if I would have to use the word there . I could n't tell , but I thought probably not . Still , I kept saying it as I walked along , not knowing what it meant , trying to get it right . Except for me there was not a sound . The moon came up , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . The later it got , the farther I could see , until I could look across the open fields that were on one side now , and make out the low hills hulking up on the other side of them . I do n't know why it is , but every big space I had seen in Japan seemed to have the same kind of stitched-up look about it ? a big piece of silver sewed up with black thread . The bay where I 'd come down in  | the parachute looked like that , and now these fields did too , moving out on my left off through the moon : that silver and black , that sewed-together look , that sewed-together feel of it , was the main Japan that I had . It took a real hold on me , and was realler than anything I 'd seen or been through . And blood : I thought about blood , too , and could n't reach it . I had killed three people , and I could n't remember that I had seen any blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she never came up . I had shot the guy for his clothes , back in the fire , but even though I 'd blown the top of his head off , there was not any blood that I 'd noticed , and the same thing was true about the guy I 'd gutted for his shoes . I thought I would stay with the road I was on , which was going a little east of north , until the moon got higher , and I could strike out across the fields by compass . I was not having any trouble this way , though . At first I was worried because the road had so many curves in it , and they were so close together . Every time I could see far enough ahead to make out the curve , I would wait and be sure that no light was coming . Then I would move on up to the bend , look around it , and wait again . I did this for around two hours , but I was n't making much distance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the shine was straighter down , I hit off across the fields . The ground was soft but had some giveback to it , too ; I thought that there was probably a crop in it ready to come up . What did they grow in Japan , anyway ? The only thing I had ever heard of was rice . They even made whiskey and wine out of it , which must take some doing . I sighted on Polaris , and moved where it said . The hills were more or less parallel to my track , but if I maintained due north , I would be sure to run into some more , and then mountains , which suited me fine . I did n't  | believe I would be walking in the open fields all night , though I could n't be sure of that , either . I was going along pretty well when I made out a house in front of me and off to the left . There were no lights in it , and no sign of any people . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me : maybe the big open spaces after all those crowded streets , maybe the cool and quiet after all the screaming , changed me and caused me to do things a little different . Whatever it was , I swerved my track again and went toward the house , closer and closer , quieter and quieter . It was not the house I wanted ? I knew that ? but I might learn something , anyway . Learn what ? I stopped in the soft of the field to puzzle it out . Even in the dark I could get to know something about a Japanese house : how it was put together , how you got into it , and maybe a little about how the rooms were ? where the kitchen was , and so on . I moved in closer , up to the nearest wall , right up to the window , which was not glass , but from the look of it was like some kind of heavy paper . It cracked a little , just a very little bit , and I steadied with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would have bet there were people in the room , but when I first put my eyes where they should 've been , I did n't see anything , anything but the other wall . But the wall was not steady ; it moved one way and another and seemed to back away , almost to disappear , and then settle down again where it was . A low light was making that happen . It was on the floor , which was maybe a foot higher than where I was standing : a candle in some kind of frame , and around it there came to be three people sitting on the floor , an old man and a woman and a little girl . They were either eating or just about to eat , or had just finished . I made out some howls and dishes , but I could n't tell  | what was in them , or if anything was . Then the old man reached for a bowl , and I knew they were going to eat . The girl passed the bowl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people and the bowls and dishes and candle , the room was bare . I reached across and pulled the knife slow , slanted it and held it close to the crack . I wanted that light , the light of that one candle , to flash off my blade ? to flash just once , whether they saw it or not . I never knew whether they did , but the flame could n't have missed the blade , because I angled it so that the light would hit it , no matter how it was shining . That was my mark , and I left , jumping out of my tracks in the field , with the tracks springing me up . After a while I looked back at the house , and even thought of going back , because everything had been so easy for me . I had forgotten to do one thing , which was to try to catch their talk , mainly to see whether they would use the word I had been practicing , and to check how I said it against the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to know that I had at least one word I could bring out if I had to . But it did n't seem worth it , and I went on . Really , though , I did n't want to take any chances with my sign , or try to make another one , or do anything that might tone down the strike of that candle on the blade . That was a pure thing , just what I wanted , even if I had n't seen it . If they had seen it ? and one of them , at least , must 've ? they would n't have known what it was , which was all right with me . They might not know what it was or what it meant , but it had been there . I was in Japan , and I had leveled my sign , and put it in . I came up on a fence , and went over it into another kind of ground , harder but not real hard . The moon glowed off it like it had n't off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . ' lookyo and  | Tinian Island were in the same time zone , and when my watch said three-thirty , that 's when it was . I could go for about an hour and a half , and then I had better look for a hole . There were n't going to be any high rocks on this night , no overhangs or caves . I went on for an hour , an hour and fifteen minutes , and there still was no shelter . I was wide open , the only man in the fields , and I did n't want the light , even the first light , to catch me . If there 'd been anything growing high enough , or just growing at all , I might have made do in the fields , but there was nothing anywhere . There were no more houses , no more barns or sheds or hog wallows where a man could lie down and shove the animals out . But the animals would have him if he came in . The animals would usually have him . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , and I went due north against the big dark black , where there were not any stars . I went right for that . There was that time , I can remember it . My foot kicked straight into something , something that felt like a bank . It was not a hill , exactly ; it was not a mountain ; there was not any feeling of rock ; no bone . Soft . I went from the soft fields to the soft bank , and kicked into it again . My foot buried . I could climb it . I could scramble . I could get up . I got up , and the moonlight hit me like saving my life . The moon hit me when I leveled , when I quit climbing and leveled . The ground underneath me was level , by God , and I had n't climbed up but just a few feet . I stood where I was , and turned around and looked back , looked out . Crops were growing at the levels ; they were growing with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A level was under-  | neath me , which I had just come from , and there was another one up above me . And another , on above that one . If I could come up the first one , I could get to the other ones , and on up . I could top out , I could crest . I could crest with it . I turned around , from the sewed-together moonlight down on the flat fields , and started to climb in the other moonlight , the one in the levels . God help me . I went up . I went up and up them . But I did n't want to clear the top . I sat down high , high up , and now I looked back again , and the whole sleep was there , the sleep of the other people . The house was down there , where I had made my flash . My mark was down there somewhere , amongst the people : three of them . It was down there with the little candle , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world , like they were in that place . That place , and not any other place . The levels were the levels , there in the moon ; they were the only levels . That 's where I was , and I opened my mouth and said it . I had the word , and I was ready to give it to them . Everything was silver and thread . Everything was levels . I was ready . I was ready for some other levels , just up behind me , and I was ready to sleep all day in one of them . Terraces , that was the name of them . I sat down . I was getting used to sitting down in Japan . What worked in one place would work in another one . I had laid down by the dead man with the bottle of wine , and he had gone off from me , and maybe lived , gone off with his folks and left the wine . I sat down solid on the level where I was ? the level somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a place I could sleep all day ? When would they come out to work ? Could I hear them , when I was asleep , climb up the levels ? the hard climb in the soft dirt , and then the straight  | foot , the foot that was n't climbing but was yours , and the flat you came out to be standing on ? The flat above the flat you had just come from ? That made you think about the flat just above you , and the one above that ? I was bushed again . I had come up through the levels underneath me ; the ones over me I would leave for later . Right now I felt the sag . But at the same time I felt the old flash in the candle , and I knew that the three people handing the bowls around would know ; would know that something they were not used to had gone by them , that they had n't suffered ; had gone through them ; had held the candle in their house for just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others . Like I say , I felt around . There was a lot of straw , and there were sticks all over . What about sleeping in the sun , I said to myself . On just this level . What about covering up with this stuff and waiting till you hear them ? First hear them , hear them climbing . And then make your move . Were these flowers , or what , they were growing ? There were twigs and stems all over the place . Nobody had cleaned up the levels of the hill , or at least not the one I was on . I figured to get a little night sleep , when I had my mind right , and get out over the top of the hill before anybody came to work , if they were going to . Farming was something I did n't know much about , and farming on terraces was so far from anything I could imagine that I did n't even try . I ought to do something , though , about being spotted if I overslept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I looked around and felt around , and I could pile things up , pile up sticks and twigs and leaves if I wanted to , and I did ; I did that . I made three long low piles like bundles , not right together but about ten or fifteen feet apart , and I figured to get down behind one of them and stretch out  | and sleep when I felt like it , when I felt more like it . My idea was to work kind of like the man at the fair who my father took me to one time in Barrow when I was a little boy . He had three shells and a pea . He put the pea under one of the shells and moved them around , and you were supposed to guess which shell had the pea . If somebody thought there might be a man behind one of my piles , he would n't know which one , and that short minute of confusion might be just what I 'd need . I stretched out behind the last pile I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to get my mind like I wanted it , so I could sleep deep and strong . I got out my knife and my sharp-stone , and my two flints . I was n't going to light a fire ? I did n't need it ? but I wanted to feel them : to feel the shapes , and know that fire was there , and had always been there , in the ground , in the hill or the mountain , that did n't know anything about fire but had it for the one who knew , and would give it to him . I started working on the knife , holding the stone in my left hand and running the blade down it at around a forty-five-degree angle ? that I knew better than the color of my eyes ? like I was trying to cut into the stone , trying to shave it , you might say . However sharp it had been , it got sharper . Knives are big with trappers , and every one of them will tell you he can put on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have n't been up in the north for a long time think it 's a good edge if you can shave with it . I even knew a logger who could shave with his ax . But shaving is just the beginning of it . I can put on an edge that will cut gauze , a long piece of it , if you hold the blade edge-up and just pitch the gauze in the air and let it come down across the knife . It 'll come down in two pieces , and you can win bets with it . I could n't do that well , up behind my pile , because  | I did n't have any oil , but I could get the steel to the shaving stage without any trouble , and I thought about shaving when I finished . But I was having a good time with it . I kept turning the blade one way and another in the moonlight , and I wo n't say that did n't make it a little bit sharper . Like I say , you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there for you , that maybe most of the others do n't know , or maybe nobody knows but you . I must have a feel about knife-shine . I must have had it all my life . I never really knew how strong it was until I held the blade in the window of that house so it 'd pick up the candle . On my level of the hill it was good to compare the strike of the moon off the blade with that other strike ? the gleam , it must 've been , which is a word I do n't use but I know the meaning ? the house gleam down there in the field under the terraces . That gleam caught in somebody 's eyes . It was in some-body 's head right now , trying to understand what had caused it . It was in that house , and it would stay there . I ran the blade down the stone five more times on each side , sharpening by feel and by the moon . I slept pretty well , not cold except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I had to stomp on the ridge to get them going . When I killed the pins in my toes I moved on . It was n't as far to the top as I had thought ? a couple of hundred feet and six places where the hill tabled off into smaller and smaller flats . And I found a little path switchbacking on up ; it was right there for mc , and easy . When I got to the top , I took a good long look back down the way I had come . For some reason I wanted to see  | people , even one person alive , moving . I ca n't tell you why . It might have been that it would be better for me to know where the closest person was , and even what he was doing , which meant I would have the advantage , if it came down to that . Even if it was just in my mind , I needed the distance between , whatever the distance would be . There was not any point , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I turned to the other side , where the terraces stepped down north , into another valley . To one side I heard a dry , stiff hustling sound . I had heard it plenty of times before , but not below me . Before I saw the birds , I knew it was feathers moving fast , hissing like a hot iron . The sound was not above , like I say , but I glanced up anyway , as I usually did . Then I looked level , and then down and off , the way I had come up the night before . There were two birds , big white ones , mostly neck and wings , barreling straight for the top of the ridge about fifty or sixty feet from me , under the crest and going for it like they were trying to hit it , cut through it , take it clean off , and for a second I thought they would , that they had the speed to do it , and their own reasons . They were dead white , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd seen except tundra swans , white-stretched and going all-out like dogs to take the hill apart . Without a feather changing , they lifted and went over the crest , clearing it by a foot or two , and then were back down at the same level they came from . It was something you 'd like to see happen more than once , but if a thing is strong enough when you see it , once is enough . It was flying that would make any airplane look ridiculous without any trouble . Later I tried a lot of times to see the top of that ridge , not like I did see it , standing there , but like they saw it , coming right into their eyes  | head-on , bigger and bigger , and knowing that they could go right through it if they wanted to , but something in them ? or in the air that knew what they needed ? right at the last second lifting them just enough , and back down , and on . I watched them make a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sight . That was all , but they went north and I followed , down the terraces and into the flat of the next valley . I used a road part of the way , and passed people now and then , going along talking to each other . I tried to walk like they did , with short steps and my head down , and nobody even looked at me . To tell the truth , I was off the road more than I was on it , going through fields that were about half grass and half sand , and it was n't till later that it came to me : I was doing what I could to make as straight a line as the birds , the tundra swans , or whatever they were . I looked up every so often to see if any more would go by , and they did , though higher than the first two . The business of being in the open bothered me , though there really did n't seem to be anything for me to worry about , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I kept looking for places to put in , and more or less grading them by how much concealment they could give me in how much sun . It is easy to hide in the dark ; anybody can do it anywhere . But in daylight you 've got to know what you 're doing . I wanted to travel any time I could , and take i -- v chances . I could n't make nearly the time I 'd like to have made if I just moved at night , but since nobody was bothering me , I figured to make as much distance as I could any time I could do it . And if I struck inland as well as north I would be in mountains , my map told me , and though the going might be harder , there would n't be as many people , and there 'd be more places to stay out of sight . As long as I could make it in the flat  | day and night , I was that much better off . Birds went over , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long neck of any one of them was the needle of a compass . It was cold , and though I could control that if I could find what I wanted to wear , I was still not as comfortable with the temperature as I wanted to be . The sun was thin , with a few high clouds , and a wind blew across me from the northeast , the sea side . I moved up to my left onto another terrace when I saw there was nobody on it , and sat down to think things out . In front of me , far off and down , was a heavy stand of trees . There might be something for me there , and I decided to go down and have a look when I could make out a way that was not too obvious . I had forgotten about the birds in my mind-move toward the trees , but now they came back before I even had to think about them . They were going by at a great rate , dozens of them , and as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like they were homing in . From every which way they were getting there , and I saw more than one lift its head and rear back , setting its wings like flaps , to go down out of sight on the other side of the trees . A curved line of bushes was between , and if I could get on the far side of it , away from the road , it should n't be hard to work on into the grove . I eased down the side of the hill , and with my new short enemy steps slanted along toward the bushes . It was almost too easy , but when I slid through the bushes it came to me that if I happened up on anybody now , I would be in a rough place , because being behind the bushes would have more the look of somebody trying to keep out of sight than if ' I had been in the open or on the road . I quickened up a little on my Japanese steps to get into the trees , where they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have got an  | understanding , especially when it comes to hiding from something , or getting after it . The trunks were very close together with a lot of low branches ; a lynx would 've loved them . I could have got up into them and moved along the limbs from one to the other , but there did n't seem to be any use in that ; no one knew about me . Here I was in a place in a country that seemed to have all the land cultivated that it was possible to farm , and it was like timberline forest , or just a little farther south of that . I stood still , listening for a scratch . Where I come from , if you hold still long enough in woods that thick , you will hear a scratch ? bark making a sound in some way ? and then you can locate what 's making it : a pine marten , a squirrel , maybe even a fisher , because everything that lives in trees or uses trees has to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , the bark will give it away , sooner or later , if it 's dry . Or if your ear is good enough and there 's no wind or rain , even if it 's not dry . All I heard was the whistle of wings , though , and the change in the sound of them when the bird would brake back and settle down . They were coming down on water , I knew before I saw it . I went up a tree about ten feet , put the needles aside just enough , and looked out . I thought of a fisher marten , which is just about my favorite animal : how he would look out . I did that . The lake was about thirty acres , with swans all over it , hundreds of them . I had never seen so many birds at the same time , even when the geese were migrating , up home . They were actually crowded , and that 's something you do n't expect birds to . It was surely not all that hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's true enough , any animal or bird is glad to food it does n't have to work for , but it seemed to me that there  | must be something else here than food , though I never did find out what it was . The fisher faded off me , except for his eyes and the fact that I was hungry , like weasels always are , and I got back into myself to figure out what might be the advantages . It was just the middle of the morning , and there was n't much I could do until the sun went down . But seeing all those swans convinced me that I had business there , and I needed time to make out my next move . It was a park , and while I sat in the tree a few people , women with little children , came in and walked part of the way around the lake , and fed the swans pieces of bread . Neither the mothers nor the children seemed any too enthusiastic about what they were doing , and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in them . I was looking for somebody who was there all the time , because there was a fence around the lake , and a little shack at the side of it nearest me . I figured somebody must live there , or use it in some way . Probably there was only one guy , and I waited to find him . It did n't take that long , or anything like it . A little girl and her mother went up to the shack and knocked on the door , and an old man in baggy clothes came out . He bent down and gave the little girl something , and then went back in . I did n't have any way of knowing whether anybody else was inside with him , but I did n't believe there was . Or if there was , it would likely be only one . I came down out of the tree , stretched out behind it , put my hands under my arms , and went to sleep . I was hungry , but your mind gets sharper when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its own way . I felt good and strong , and fast , and quick . My time as a fisher had done me good . My eyes burned through the leaves and needles when I opened them .  | I slept a long time , curled up and not too uncomfortable , and when I woke up the sun was just leaving . I could n't see the lake from the ground , so I went up the same tree until I could . There were no people in sight . All I could hear was the rustle of feathers as the swans brushed against each other , and the whistle of feathers on the ones still in the air , changing their beat as they pulled up and settled in . A dim light was in the shack , and I planned to wait until I knew the park was closed and empty except for whoever might be in the shack . With the dark I felt my strength grow until it was better than any sensation I or anybody else has ever had ? a million times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out through my nose had fire in it , except that it was cold , colder than the air . I slid down and stepped clear of the trees . It was no trouble getting past the fence . The top rail was smooth metal , and I just put one hand on and vaulted over . The swans nearest where I came down made a shift , a little flurry , and then were just like the others , crowding , a few of them dipping their heads . I moved along toward the shack , in the shadows ; there were plenty of them . I got to the one window . There was nobody but the old guy , with light shining on his bald head , in the middle of short bristly hair . He was bent over , and I waited until I could make outwhat he was doing . After my eyes came good I saw he was working on something on a table , and when I could see even better I could make out it was a swan with its wings spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I moved a little I could barely tell ? but I could tell ? that the old man was fixing one of the swan 's legs , putting a splint on it and wrapping it with string or tape . The swan could n't bring its head up , but the light caught its eye ; there was nothing in it that had any interest . People in hospitals have the  | same look . I tried the door , and it was not locked . Then I pushed on in , little by little . He never heard me . For a second I stood right behind him and watched his hands work on the swan 's leg . I pulled the knife and took the step , the one step . I had him under the throat , lifting him off the floor , and ran the knife through him right to left , all the way through . I held him until he quit kicking ? both legs kicked together ? and then let him down slow . He was close enough to my size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pants . There were some bags in a corner , and I took the biggest one and put the others over him . Then I went back to the table . I cut off the swan 's head and started pulling out feathers and putting them into the bag . When I had got one side plucked , I cut out a piece of the leg and ate it . People have a hard time getting used to the idea of eating raw meat , but it is not really much different from the way it is when it 's cooked . I ate all I wanted , and then plucked the rest of the feathers . I aimed to fill the bag before I left . Then I could work for cold weather , sure enough . There were a lot of things I could do with feathers . I needed more , though . I would have to go after them on the lake , grab the swans out of the crowd they were in , any way I could . My notion was to panic some of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take what I could get . I left the bag in the shack and went out . The swans were just like they had been , a big shifting blur on the water , making those strange noises they make , all neck but still sounding like they were a long way off , no matter how close you were . I worked the shadows , then let them see me as I came nearer . There was a corner to the lake , and some of them bunched up in that . When enough of them got in , I picked up a stick and  | pitched it . Three or four slapped and flapped up out of the water , and I hit the shadows again , and worked around . There were two left on land when I got close enough , and I grabbed the nearest one . I made the mistake of catching it by the wing and one leg , and it turned and bit me right below the eye . That thing really clamped down , without making a sound , and would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe a bird could be as strong as that one was , not even a bird that big . It bashed me with its wings and it was like being hit with a soft hammer , but one that had a whole lot of power in it , soft or not . To tell the truth , I was afraid to turn it loose , afraid it would come after me if I did , and maybe the whole lake of them would hit me then , from the water , the land , the air , everywhere . I dragged the swan into the water and held it down with everything I had , held it and kept on holding it . After a long time it died , and I was left with that long neck in my hands and the wings down limp : all that power , and the thing so light . I could n't believe it . I went for the bag , dragged the swan into the dark , and plucked it . And ate a little more , too . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thrown in , and from then on I used it . I found out I could get close to the swans without all that stalking , and when I did , I could level a hard lick along where their heads were , and I 'd hit one or two of them , and one of them really hard , usually . It was n't easy , and I missed some , but I was at it nearly all night , plucking them and then slitting them open , letting them fill with water and sink . I raised a lot of hell with those birds , and if I 'd been able to carry more sacks I could 've had more feathers . But by the time I finished I had all I really needed , and I put the bag over the fence , went kick through the trees , then through the bushes , and was in the open again , and on the road if I wanted it . My face was bleeding  | pretty badly ? flowing right on ? and I kept trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to laughing , not a whole lot but really , when I thought of the old guy back under the burlaps . He could say that I killed him for his feathers , which is the God 's truth . The bag was great . I hefted it and shook it around , and the feathers made a sound like they did when they were flying by on the real birds . All the time I 've been alive I wondered at the strange things that come to my mind when they do n't have any reason to come . The trees had made me think of the fisher marten , and a big wave of love went over me when I thought I might be like it was , and have the eyes it had . Now it was the swans I had killed , and also the ones I had not killed , and would never kill ; they were all the same bird . I shook the bag and the feathers scraped and whistled , and I laughed again . I looked up as some more birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swans in flight , hearing them , it was hard not to think I could fly myself , and I did n't turn my thoughts , because on that particular road , at that time , they were right . I wanted to lay up for a day or two , and sew . I had some thread in my emergency kit , though I did n't think I had enough . I could come on more thread , though , I believed ; there would have to be some wherever I went . I had two coats and two hairs of pants , all of them more or less the sizes to fit me . I might have to cut a little in one place or the other , but that was all right . Though it was not cold enough for it where I was , I wanted to make an insulated suit , with feathers between the two layers of  | clothes , and then carry the suit in the bag until I was ready for it . That meant I needed one more suit for the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was going to make the suit any time soon , I needed the extra clothes before I started sewing . When I thought it over , I decided not to do it until I had the other suit , which I would find some way to get in the next few days . That was good enough , and I went on , shaking the bag now and again , for the sound . The last part of the night I stayed on the road , checking my compass now and again , ready to get off into the fields if the road swung too much from north . I was pretty sleepy after a while , and went on not really paying enough attention to what I was doing . Then I heard somebody yell , and out of nothing three or four people were running straight at me . If they came up to me and talking developed , I was out of luck . I looked right and left for shadows , and hit the ground next to a dirt bank with my feet pulled up under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I got ready . " 1'hen they stood there , and one of them said something , and then something that sounded like the same thing . I stood up slow and put up a hand like I might be asking for something , or even begging : begging maybe for them not to hurt me , hit me , maybe for them to understand me . I held my hand flat between his eyes and mine . He took half a step in , and I straightened up with everything I had and took him in the middle of the chest with my shoulder , lifting at the same time . Before he even hit the ground I was past him and the others , running like the first day the snow had melted and I was clear of snowshoes : like I was on the floor of the valley , and enough weight taken off me and my feet to make me light enough to fly . I had the bag of feathers and the other stuff , but that did n't slow me down at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there 's never been a one of those little people who could catch me when I had the summer-valley feeling . I let my stride out , and I have to say that I was really moving , and not afraid of a thing . When I turned a corner of the road I was gone , not where they probably thought I would go , into the grass to the left , but over a wall to the right and behind a little house , and around on the other side of it , and then down flat in what was probably a garden , long stems all around . I put the bag of feathers and my other stuff under me and waited . I had seen a lot of rabbits wait , and marmots , and mice and even lemmings . The snowshoe hare can stay all day in one position , all night , as long as he wants or thinks he 's in danger , or even could be in danger . I can make out a hare when a weasel ca n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white weasel go by a hare when I was looking right at it ; a lynx might 've seen him , but I 'd put myself up against one of those , too . I was still : still like that , and kept my eyes closed , and listened . Nobody came . I could n't hear anybody search , and I could n't hear any sound from the road , either . I listened to the other side then , and heard something I did n't like . The sound must have been there all the time when I was concentrating on what was close to me . There was a far-off noise of cars ? trucks maybe , most of them ; they kept shifting gears ? and though the sound broke every now and then , it always picked back up and went on and on . I would n't have been surprised if it was a truck convoy , and that meant I was not only fairly near a highway but maybe another big town . I did n't remember that there 'd been one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a military base of some kind . With my attention on the birds for the last few hours I had n't taken any notice of aircraft , though there must have been some , would  | have to have been . Lying in the long bare stems on the bag of feathers , I listened for them among the far-off trucks and other cars , jeeps , whatever they were . I stayed an hour , and in that time I heard two aircraft . Both of them cut their engines , which had to mean they were landing . Putting things together , I read a strip or even an air base somewhere around , maybe not too far . That meant I 'd better get back up on the terraces , or any other hills I could find . A few civilians I could get around ; a whole lot of the military in one place , most of them armed , I could n't . I got up out of the weeds , the stems , picked up the bags , and headed out over the wall due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to make them . There was still some moon , going down fast , and I went up three terraces , then four , then five , and walked along the last one . The Japanese did n't seem to keep any lights in their houses , though I saw one every few hundred yards ? I was heading north again ; Polaris was right in front of me ? and even though I did n't make very good time , I was going more or less steadily toward where I wanted to go . I looked for a place to hole up and sleep , when it began to get light . There was something in the way , and it did n't move . I went to it real slow , with my hand on my knife , what I called my bone knife . It still did n't move , and when I got next to it I saw it was a rock . Smack there on the terrace ; I had n't seen a rock that big since I 'd been in Japan . Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their food , their habits , their religion , and all that . I never paid much attention , but I did remember the thing they have about rocks . They were supposed to have whole churches ? temples , I guess they call them ? where they have rocks put around in a certain way , and they sit down and look at  | them , as still as a snowshoe hare that thinks the lynx is after him . What a damn lot of foolishness I could never have thought up in a thousand years , but this big rock in the middle of the terrace was maybe something like that ; if they 'd wanted to farm that place , they would sure have got it out of there . It was big ? as tall as I was ? and rough , and I wondered how they could have got it up there . It must have weighed tons ; it would have taken a good many men to push it over . But I did n't want anybody to push it over . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got down behind it where the terrace shelved up , and when I got in a little under it , I practiced a couple of moves . I could roll out either way , to the north or to the south , depending on what I had to do and how quick I had to get up . When I was satisfied , I stretched out as far under the rock as I could get and still roll fast and move , and relaxed in the rock dark , as pure as dark can get . I put one hand on my knife in the position to draw it , and touched my dick with the other . It was the same as it had always been . That was good , real good . Nobody had done a thing to me . I pushed up under the rock a little farther , even , and thinking about the one or two low stars to the north , but mainly about Polaris , which was not going to move , I went to sleep . It was a good long sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have . Lying with my head on the sack of feathers , I had the feeling that the rock got warm along with me , and that I was in the place I 'd rather be than anywhere else in the world . Just before I went all the way into the dark my own dark , inside the rock 's dark ? I kept thinking of the snowshoe hare and the lynx , and the stillness : the stillness of two kinds . In that picture ? image , whatever you 'd want to call it ? I saw the way , or I think I did . Camouflage , when you look at it right , is one of  | the most interesting things of all . I 'd seen a lot of it up on the Brooks , seen it in birds , seen it in animals of all kinds up there , feathers changing colors , fur changing colors , to hide better , to hunt better : both sides . To be invisible and still to know what was going on , that was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ghost . When I started thinking about camouflage , like I say , I knew what I wanted to do ? no , what I had to do . It was going to be the way . Not the way out of Japan ? by now I had almost no notion of ever leaving Japan . If I had had to go back to the States or to the Territory , I would n't have any idea what to do . I was so much involved in what I was doing now , the interest of it , the possibilities : the way up to the north , the other big island the maps and the briefers told us was all mountains and snow , where there would be the kind of animals and birds I grew up with , the kind of cold that cleans out your insides like fire , where there 's ice in the water and I could live like I was used to living , like I wanted to live . There ought to be places between me and the mountains and the snow fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and take them on , at least in some way . If I took my time ? and I had plenty of it ? I should be able to fit the color of some of my situations ? hillsides , fields , woods ? and tune to them : tune myself to them by color . Maybe this would n't always work , and maybe I would n't always be able to do it , but I planned to try . It was worth it , worth a lot . It might he worth everything . I drifted into sleep with all this on my mind , and there 'd been very few times when I 'd been happier . What happened then was what should have happened , and it clinched the thing for me . I was in snow , and bushes were over Inc like the rock was over me . I was dead white , and still , stiller  | than the rock , than the bush . I was waiting , and I knew I would wait for as long as it took . I guessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger was there . Plenty of fear I had , and in the dream ? daydream at night , or whatever it was ? I was afraid to move . But then , too , I was not only afraid to move , but I knew how not to move . I closed my eyes and knew that I was dead white , and might not be found . But as I lay there everything slowly started to change . I was not afraid : the main sensation I had was terrific hunger , more than I 'd ever had . The stillness translated into that , turned into it . I was not under the bush anymore . I was outside , but I was just as still . My muscles , though they were crouched , were not pulled up to make me small , but gathered , and I could tell they were longer . I looked for the breath of the other thing ; I looked for the eyes . Breath , breath , I held my own , there in the open field with one bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was open its eyes and I would be on it . It would not have a chance . I woke up in the same position . When I turned my head the feathers crackled . I gathered myself up and rolled out in the same way I 'd practiced the night before , but there was no need . I crouched , stayed in the crouch for a moment , and stood up . The light before the sun was coming on ; I could see the roughest places in the rough rock . The snow field and the two kinds of stillness left me , though they had told me what I needed to know , and I began to listen and look for more aircraft , the reality of them . The traffic , though farther away , was still there , and I was more sure than ever there was an air base somewhere around , maybe even over the next hill . The hill curved , the terrace curved . When I came around I looked down into the valley on my right , and stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three of them were aircraft , parked in yards . They were Jacks , the big new barrelshaped fighter the Nips had just brought into combat . I had never seen one in the air , but we 'd been briefed on them , and told to watch for a plane that looked like the P-47 , the Jug , but did n't have as big an engine . The Jack is a clumsy-looking crate , even more than the Jug is , and it looked even clumsier standing next to those Japanese houses where civilians lived . They were n't camouflaged , and one of our fighters could have got all three of them on one pass . It did n't matter all that much ; that was somebody else 's problem . What it did tell me was that I had been right about there being an air base not far away . The Jacks would have to get to a strip to take off ; they sure could n't use the dirt road they were parked next to . The likely thing was that they would use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would n't make sense , even to the Nips , to have their roads cluttered up with aircraft for long stretches . I was close to a strip , I was sure , and when I came around the next curve it was right there in my face . It was a big field , real big , going out as far as I could see , but there were no aircraft up . Around the tin hangars , which were starting to catch the sun , a few people moved around . I would have to make a big detour to get past the place , and I was beginning to put my mind to it , watching the hangar area because there was not anything else to look at except rows of parked aircraft ? mainly Bettys and Zeroes , with a few more of the big ugly Jacks ? and empty field going out to the horizon , when my eyes concentrated before they knew it , and I went down on my belly , wishing I had field glasses or the kind of sight a hawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and were walking him along . Even as far away as I was , I could see that his  | hands were tied behind his back , and that could mean only one thing . Or it meant two things : he was an American , and what they told us at Tinian about being captured was the truth ? the Japs were going to do what we 'd been told about . I wondered if it was somebody who 'd been shot down in the same raid I was , or in some other raid , but it did n't really matter . They came out through the rows of planes to an open space just off the near end of the hangars , and stopped . The wind picked up , coming from there over me , and I listened , listened hard . There was nothing I could get , and I put more strength into my ears , and cocked one , cupping it . But I did n't need to , and I probably would n't have needed the wind , either , though with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screamed , standing there with his hands tied , and screamed again , something that sounded like a name , but if it was , I did n't catch it . The others shoved him down onto his knees , and he fell over to one side , moving his legs . One of the Japs pulled him by the hair back to his knees and he screamed again , and this time it was not a name ? just a sound , high and carrying . There was a lot in that sound , and if I had n't known what made it , I would have been hard put to believe it was from a human . It was not like any animal , either ; it was different from all of them . The sun was pretty near blinding , now , off the tin roofs of the hangars when you looked that way . The shimmer of it spread on the tin , and in some way seemed to stand up off it into the air and curve , one wave bending out toward the ocean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bunch of men , too , and for a second it seemed like some kind of magic that the blaze from the roof had put into somebody 's hands , there in another curve , short and flashing in and out of the dry cold light that should have been hot . The rest of the group stood back , and  | there were just two of them then , at the edge of the cement , on the grass this side of it . The man on his knees was still . The Jap with the light in both hands bent his left knee like somebody getting ready to hit a baseball , and brought the sword around in a fast lick like a man who knew exactly what he was doing , had done it before . The American 's head fell forward , but not off . Blood jumped in front of him at least a yard , and before he went down the Jap with the sword hit him again , and this time the head came off and rolled over . The body jerked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other Japs came over and kicked it a couple of times , hard . There was nothing more to see . Before they picked up the body and the head I was already moving off , keeping low , and over the crest onto the terrace on the other side . I leaned against the bank with the feathers , checked my compass , set my mind forward , and started west , to spend however much time it took to get around the base . I made a wide detour , very slow , going ahead a few steps at a time like I was on a stalk ; I would probably be on a still-hunt before long . It was cold but not too cold . I had been looking forward to sewing my suit of feathers , but I did n't really need it yet , and besides , I wanted some other clothes to wear while I did the sewing . Right then I concentrated on making time ? slow time ? around the air base , and gave it as much room as it needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terraces , and on some of them people were working , but I moved so they were all far away from me . From what I could tell , the Japanese , the men and the women both , like to spend a lot of  | their time crouched over . More than half of them wore glasses , and it struck me that all of them , or most of them , were nearsighted and could n't cope with anything unless they could get their eyes right up next to it . I could see them working with whatever they planted on the terraces , bent way over and staying that way , moving around little by little , or down on their knees peering at something right in front of them . Only once did I see anybody turn his head and look anywhere else but at the ground . The guy saw me , but I just stood there and then bent over like they did . When he looked back down at the ground , I was gone . When I had been traveling on the terraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but northwest , and by that time I was off the terraces and into real hills , steep ones , like foothills are , some places . That suited me a lot better , because there were not likely to be people , or only a few now and then , since there was no work to do on the hills , amongst the trees , except maybe picking up kindling , and no food . It was very quiet , and as I topped out over one hill after another , and never came on anybody , I decided I would knock off the traveling and rest up . I still had a little raw swan meat , and knew I had better eat it before it went bad from carrying it and sweating on it , and I pulled up in a corner where that particular hill made an angle , and figured to have myself a picnic and rest my feet . Whenever I could quit the sweat-out of moving in daylight I was cheerful , and felt like I 'd spent the day pretty well , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since the night before , and my notions about camouflage , I had got more confidence than ever , and I looked forward to being still and turning my mind on that subject again , for the good feeling . I did all that . First I thought about camouflage , but I could n't  | add a whole lot to what I 'd already come up with . Even though it was cold enough , there was not any snow yet . I was n't expecting it here , anyway ; I was n't ready for it . I was moving through hills and short fields covered with needles ? spruce needles , though not the kind in Alaska ? and I thought brown had to be the good color , an easy color to pick up from . The dirt was almost the same color as the needles . But I would n't do that tonight , I told myself , chewing on part of a swan wing . I would n't . I 'd give myself a vacation , and think forward , on up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always was . When I got to the deep snow I would roll in it , roll in it like a bear . I could feel every sense I had get better just thinking about it . The light went and the moon came , and another light . I put the bag of feathers over my feet , and then opened it and put my feet in amongst the feathers , which was great . When my feet got warm the rest of my body did , too . If you know anything about cold-weather people , you 'll know how true that is . I got up before dawn and traveled , slanting a little west again as the sun came up over the hills . The land was higher now , and the hills were steeper . There were no roads at all . When the sun was about level with me I topped out over the highest rise yet and there was a lake below me , a fairly big one , around a hundred and fifty acres , as I judged . I thought about seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where I could hide in the bushes along the edge and try to fish with my emergency hooks and line . I was almost out of swan meat and would have to have something to eat soon , to keep going .  | I had never seen a lake so empty since I left Alaska ; there were people and boats swarming all over the ones in the States . The blue of the water was sure an interesting color , and as the sun came up and hit down and across it , the color deepened and brightened in a way that would really hold your eye . I 'd seen the sun on water lots of times , and always liked it , but there 's one thing I always look for that I have n't seen but once or twice , in summer after the ice melts on the Brooks and there 's water standing in lots of places . The sun on top of water is one thing , but the sun in it ? down somewhere under the surface where it makes a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that changes , that goes in and out like it 's breathing ? that 's something else again , I 'll tell you . This lake had that for me . It might have been my angle from it , or the angle of the sun , or maybe both , but I saw that gold box with the sides thinner than any paper , alive down there , alive with itself . It was big , too , the biggest yet ; it would 've had to be big for me to see it from that far . Then the box was gone , but I took it for a good sign , and knew I could go down and do whatever I wanted , near where it was . I made little steps down through the trees ? mostly needle trees but also a small kind of oak with wide , stout branches ? watching all the time . There was a cove right under me where the trees grew down to the edge of the water , and I slid into it and looked around . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the time another way . It was warmer , and I could have sewed my cold-weather gear together if I 'd wanted to , got the feathers into the clothes and not have to carry the hag anymore . But if I did that , I would have to wear what I made , and if there was even a chance that it would be warm anywhere , I would sweat bad , lose a lot of strength , and not have anything I could  | do about it . Wait , I said ; wait on the cold and the weather that would make a suit of feathers feel like it was something that God made just for you . Wait for the other island , I said . Or the full north of this one . I sat down in the bushes to rest my back . The lake took on a different tone this close : it was a lighter blue . What I wanted was to get another glimpse of the sun down in the water , under it a few feet , or way down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun in a box , in that red-orange box that went in and out , that beat like a heart in a way nobody could ever have thought of , but was there . I could n't find it , though , no matter what , no matter how I angled my head through the bushes . But I had seen it from the hill , in a way that must be like you 'd see a ghost , and that heart , that sun in a box , I had . It meant a lot to me . I kept thinking about it : the underwater cube , about half box and half diamond . I peeled my emergency kit loose from my side , opened it , and took out the fishhooks . The kit itself was exactly like it had been when I taped it to me on Tinian . I had looked at it once , in the cab of the gantry on the dock where I came down , but I had taken the time to put it back together right , and it was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or wherever the Air Force got it . The fishhooks were bright , with the kind of brightness that makes metal seem new , whether it is or not . They caught the sun , and with each of the four I held the shank and bent the curve out a little . When you get the hook in the fish 's mouth you do n't want him to be able to nose up against the shank and tear loose . It should be just him and the hook , and you pulling on it from the other end . That 's something they do n't teach you in factories , but the machines could just as easily do it as not , if they knew what they were doing . I packed  | the kit again and taped it back . The adhesive was still strong enough , and I could pull it loose two more times , or maybe three , before I would have to think of some other way to carry it . But that would be later . I looked back up through the bushes onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a handful of dirt . I could do it ; I believed my notion was right ; it would work . Beginning with my feet , I rubbed the dirt into my shoes and clothes , into the skin of my hands and face . It took me an hour to do the job right , taking off the pants first , and then the shirt ? or coat , whatever it was ? to do the back parts . I wanted the dirt dry , and kept it that way , and rubbed it in , heeling it with my hand to put on as much pressure as I could . Now and then , as the sun got higher , I matched the color of the clothes ? my color now ? to the slant of the hill . I kept doing this , and in the end the match was surely close . If I kept still I was sure I would blend with the hill , with any hill around there . Then we would see . I worked on my face and hands again , looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its color , darker and darker , but not too dark . There was not a sound , except a little sift of air at the level of the water . Sitting there on my heels , I was quieter than it was , and I waited , halfway between the snowshoe hare and the lynx , enjoying both sides , hiding and still-hunting at the same time . Something flowed back and forth between the two kinds of invisibility , the two kinds of stillness , until finally ? I could n't help it , did n't want to ? I bent forward on one knee and pulled the knife up along my thigh and out . Light on things was different in Japan , I was thinking ; at least it was for me . Especially it seemed to catch metal and water at another angle , and catch it quicker and stay longer , always quivering . I tilted the blade , running the sun up and down it .  | wondered if anybody on the other bank would pick up the flash . It was a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If anybody noticed , it would be like the house where I had flickered the fire of the candle off the blade : the family had looked up and around , and then gone back to eating and forgotten about it . There had been a sign set in that house , and this was another one . I bent over close to the water and laid the blade flat on it , and then a little under , still catching the sun . I did n't run the light along it this time , but held it steady , making it balance like the bubble in a carpenter 's level , branding the blade from inside . Very satisfying it was , for sure . After I wiped off the blade and put it back , I opened the survival kit and got out the small GI knife and sharpened it . I washed the dirt off my face , sat on a rock where I could clean off the hair in the lake , and shaved . It was not so bad , shaving in cold water , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fresh skin . I waited for a few minutes before I smeared on more dirt , just to keep the freshness feel longer and watch the light on the lake at the same time . When I 'd done that , I put on a new face of dirt and was ready to try it out . Going up the hill , I kept matching myself with what I came to , with whatever I passed . I would look at the back of my hand against a bare place on the slope , and if I had kept still , and there had been any distance at all between my hand and whoever was looking , it would have been hard to tell it was there . When I was about ten years old my father took me south , all the way down into the States , to Colorado , because he thought that maybe we ought to move there , get off the Brooks Range so I could grow up with more people around , not just Indians and Eskimos . We staved in Colorado a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back north as soon as we could . There was nothing for us  | amongst all those cars and stores , where you have to ride everywhere . I did get off into some of the hills around Greeley , though . It was summer , and real hot , and I remember climbing down part of the trail , and out of the corner of one eye I saw a rock move . I went over real slow , and it did n't move ; it was just a rock , a dull slope and the pattern of it . And then it moved again , like a wave of rock , coming to life and flowing , almost floating , over the other ground with the same marks . It was a big rattlesnake , the only one I ever saw , and when it quit moving again I got as still as it was , and took it in . We both stayed a long time , and then it started off again . When it moved the whole canyon shifted a little . This time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't see it , because it had blended in even better than before or was under another rock or was just gone . From watching the animals and birds up on the muskeg , on the tundra , and on the Brooks , I 've always believed that if camouflage is good enough , if it is right exactly , the bird or the animal will not just be invisible , it wo n't be there . When the rattlesnake did something so that my eyes ? which can see what the others ca n't ? could n't pick it up , I knew I was right . My hand on the bare place on the slope , there in Japan , was like that . Like that or just about ; it was almost somewhere else , or just not . I moved part of the way up the side of the hill , and when I could n't see the lake anymore I started to travel again , walking the slant and being quiet . My camouflage made a lot of difference in the way I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dimension , you might say ; that was the feeling of it . And because it was , the trees and bushes and pine needles and rocks that were on the slope were different , too . I used the trees in another way from what I was used to . When I came to a bare place the other dimension was stronger , like it even stood out  | from me , stood off me a little , and everything in me and on me got better . Where there were trees I slid from one to the other on the downhill side of them . Where there were spaces between I went over them , not hurrying , facing uphill , not just to see what might come down from that side , but to give my camouflage a chance to work , give me a chance to check it . The only thing that worried me were the bags . I had done everything I could to make them the same color I was , but they were still loose from me , not right on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust them not to swing or separate from me in some way that somebody might notice , if he was to look . But nothing like that happened , and I went right along , and must have made a couple of miles , concentrating on the different shades of brown ? needles and bark ? as my own brown came past them and through them . I was hungry . I 'd been hungrier , but I knew that before long I would most likely have to be around people again , for their food ; I did n't want to go another day without eating anything . It takes energy to walk , a lot of it , especially when you 're walking the side of a slope and have to do a certain amount of balancing . I was thinking about this when I heard a shuffle , up from me and maybe fairly far off . I was between two trees . I stopped right there and waited . I could have got down behind the next trunk ? it was only a few steps ? but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be close enough to see my eyes , no matter where they were . It was people : four women and two girls , all in long black dresses . They were picking up sticks and tying them into bundles . I could n't hear any sound from their handling the sticks : the shuffling was made by their clothes . Strange that the sound carried that far : about fifty yards , where they came out of the trees . I stayed where I was , and when all six heads were down I  | put the bag on the ground behind me and got real still again , waiting for one of the heads to turn . That happened . One of the women , old and almost baldheaded , separated off from the others and came down the hill . One step she took , two , then three , looking at the ground all the time . I looked with her : looked for the same sticks she was looking for . Neither one of us found any . Then she raised up ? Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she did ? and had her eyes on some place a few feet to the north of me . She turned to go backup the hill , and when she did her eyes went across me like a ray , the beam of a flashlight , if you can think of it that way in broad daylight , and then went right on by . Nothing about me registered at all , and I breathed and waited more , halfway hoping she 'd do it again , because my invisibility was strong , the strongest yet . It stood off me like a wall , a circle ; she could n't break it . Come on , old lady , I said , almost out loud . Come across me again and not see me . Come back the other way this time , going north . She bent down again , though , and went back to the others , doing as close to crawling as a person could and still be on feet . They talked a minute ? me all the time standing right out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got all the bundles of wood together in a pile , picked them up , and put them on one woman 's back or the other , and in those shufflesteps moved up the hill . When the trees closed in behind them I followed , out of sight but going where they were , at least for a while . When I got up over the ridge they were gone , and I forgot about them and just walked , staying on the ridge and having no more to do with them except to remember the wom-an 's eyes going past me , around me , over me , like a flashlight  | beam in broad daylight : something inside the other light that could n't see . I did n't run into anybody else that afternoon , and I moved along more or less like I wanted to . There did n't seem to be any reason for me not to stay on top of the ridge , where it was easier to walk , and so I did . The notion came to me that I might try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell , and from my map , it was steeper there , and I might not be as likely to run into anybody . But for now things seemed to be pretty much in my favor the way they were , and there was no sense in my changing them just to be changing . I walked the ridge , looking down both sides every few steps , until it began to get dark . It had warmed up some , and was really not uncomfortable weather at all . I knew what I was going to do . First I wanted to make something unusual , so that if somebody found it they would look at it and not me . In the last light I piled up a lot of branches and twigs and pine straw , and shaped the whole thing more or less the size of a man , like I did before , though he would 've been bigger than I am . I had the pile , my straw man , just under the east side of the ridge . I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to cause suspicion if nobody came along . But if I put him down under the crest a little , and somebody found him , I 'd be sure to hear it when it happened , and I could move off in the dark . Sound was what I depended on . I had all the confidence in the world that this would work . I can hear as well as anything on two feet , and most of them on four . I can listen with any animal . After I finished under the ridge , I went down about fifty yards and made another pile like the first one , but this time behind a tree ; the head and feet stuck out only just barely . When I 'd  | checked it from every position I got inside , put my hands under my armpits and my feet in the sack of feathers , and stretched out . I could still feel the ray , the beam of the woman 's eyes , go past me . I left my listening on , wide open , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past again , like a lighthouse beam going around and coming back . I knew I would sleep , and I did . Never better . I got up at first light and went to check my man under the crest . Nobody had bothered him , and I left him like he was , with a friendly feeling for him watching out for me all night . I needed to eat , that was all . I hoped the day would figure that out for me . I decided that it would n't be a good idea to walk the ridge all day , because I was almost sure to come on somebody on one side or the other , and I did n't want to stand out against the sky or the trees for a long time , either ; that would be maybe putting more weight on my luck than it could hold . Besides , the ridge was dropping , getting closer and closer to the floor of the valley between banks , and when the land flattened out there 'd be people , more than likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ridges to the west until I found one I wanted , then moved up to look down the crest , to see what was on the other side , and plan for it . At first it did n't seem any different from the brown side of the hill , like the other hills and slopes I 'd been on . But it was not exactly the same when I stayed with it , watching . About a hundred yards off , part of the hill was moving , and it was not with wind . There was n't any wind , and the movement seemed to be going away from me , like parts of the bank stepping backward  | and upward on each other , lifting one foot , one bunch of needles after the other , to climb , but not moving from the same place . I had never seen anything like it , or felt anything like it . I held on there , in the feeling , for a couple of minutes because I thought I should n't break it . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping backward up the hill in the same place , going but not going . The feeling left me , or thinned out some , and I wanted to know . I moved , not toward the other hill but to one side , and the shape of the thing came clear . It was a wheel of some kind , turning backward , like a ferris wheel I 'd seen in Colorado on that trip with my father . I could n't hear any sound from it , but now and then there was out when I got to looking for it , but hit me quicker or slower than I expected , like a game , like something blind-siding me because it knew it could . It was not steel , not glass or tin ; it was water-flash , not any other kind , and it was being carried up , backward and around . The thing I was looking at was a water wheel . I went toward it , tree by tree , then across the floor of the draw where there were not any trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead alone , the same color as the hillside and the wheel . It was fed from a spring behind it , in a low position you could n't see from the forward side . I drank with both hands , and watched the buckets fill and come down and forward and under , then up backward and around , and top out over the ridge , where people must have got the water when they needed it . ' I'he wheel and everything about it ? the rims , the spokes , the cross-strips that held them together , the buckets , the pins they turned on ? was a job of work you would n't see every day , going around on itself like it was , not making one sound you  | could hear until you were right there at it , and with it , until you were as close as I was . Even then I could barely make out a faint splash as a bucket went under the spring , and a little wet grind-ing-swinging noise as it passed the bottom of the curve and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute how good the Japs were with wood . Everything about the wheel looked like it ought to have been made out of metal , engineered metal , but it was n't . Wood was better ; this way , it was . A real balance was part of the whole rig : I had the notion that air could have turned it just as easily as water was doing . I went over closer , where I could see into the buckets as they came past . A tree was right behind me , and in every bucket as it started to lift , a reflection of branches and leaves was in it , trembling , rocking , being held and raised with a lot of care , like the water in each bucket that went by was worth more than the last . It was a thing I did n't mind watching , did n't mind getting in there with and staying for a while . The way the water was raised lifted something in me , too , that at any other time might have too much weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even move . When I turned , an old woman was looking right at me from about ten feet away . She might have seen a man made out of pine straw and dirt , holding a brown bag , but she saw me , eyes and all . I had got used to holding still when I thought somebody might be watching , and I did n't want to give myself away like the snake in Colorado , so that I saw the rock move and turn into him . I was already nailed now , though . Where the woman had come from , how she had got so close without my knowing it , I could never figure out because I never heard a thing . She was just near me , a rag around her hair , her head cocked and her mouth a little open . I could n't let her go , or stay .  | I had the knife through her before she could even blink , and then pulled it out and put it through her again . She had n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ? deep ? and from there went over the whole valley with my eyes . There was not any change . I picked up the body , which was hardly bleeding , and carried it over behind the tree that had made the reflection in the buckets . I looked back at the water wheel , and it gave me a notion of something to do . Behind the tree I sawed off the head and put pine straw and leaves over the body , making a shape like the one I had left on the ridge the night before , to watch out over me while I was asleep . Then I took the head and fitted it into one of the buckets , just as it came past . I watched it rise up toward the crest of the ridge , but before it got there I left , keeping to the lower side of the slope until the wheel was out of sight behind me . A head for a head , I thought . But really , when I 'd done it I did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me later , after I was gone . All the rest of the day I traveled west and north , moving over one ridge after another . The ridges were about the same height , but the whole land was climbing , me with it . I thought the country would probably top out and leave me on a plateau , and if that was so , I 'd have to be even more careful than I already was . Walking the slopes , I was protected on one side until I cleared the crest , and I was more or less confident that my hillside brown would pretty much keep me from being seen , at least at a distance , though it still bothered me that the old woman had got up on me without my knowing it . If it had been anybody else , or more than one , it might have been bad . I went  | on , doing my best to make sure that nothing like that would happen again . Three times I saw people , always below me , picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , whose voice , sharp and thin , was the only one I heard . They were far down from me , all the time with their eyes on the ground , and I eased by them little by little until I was out of sight , and could pick up my pace . In the late afternoon wind started to blow , and when I came up over another ridge it did n't fall off to the other side . I had my plateau , and now I tried to figure what to do with it . Being as cautious as I could , I went along it , still angling west , and came to a kind of gully , with walls about ten or twelve feet high . I thought at first that it was a road , because it was getting too dark to see , but when I slid down into it I could tell it was not a road . But the gully was not natural , I could tell that , too . The bed , covered with leaves and pine straw , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as free as air , near the west bank . I thought the middle would be just as good , and more room , but when I tried to cross , my foot caught on something and I went down . When I was down I was already feeling , though , and in a minute knew what the situation was . The sides were cutbanks , and under the leaves and needles were railroad tracks , closer together than any I knew about , but tracks they were . I looked north along them , and in the new moonlight I could see a wink of metal forward from me , and then , now that I knew what I was looking for , another one farther on . I walked ahead in the moonlight , one foot on the west side of the tracks and the other in the middle , and even on the curves I did n't stumble again . I felt freer than I had in a long time , going along with no slope to climb or pull back against , with no trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tired out , and then climbed up the  | east bank ? it was not quite as high ? put my feet in the bag of feathers and my head on a pile of pine straw , and went into a good strong sleep . When I woke up I was sorry the night was over . Walking the tracks in the moonlight had been a good thing ; after every curve I would look for the glints along in front of me , and they kept springing up , white with some blue in it , like runway lights set to show you where to come down , to be safe for a little while on the ground after the night 's raid . Finally I stretched , and slid down the cutbank . I knelt down then , and put my ear to the track . I had done this a few times before , in western Alaska where they have railroads , and also in Colorado , but I had never heard anything . I wondered what the sound was supposed to be . Somebody had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you listen to the rails . I bent down , solid on my hands and knees , and listened again . Nothing . But I stayed there and thought about my listening ? my ear , I guess you could say ; my brain , my head ? going both ways down the track , but mainly forward , through the woods , on over the mountains ahead of me , over roads and bridges , through towns , on and on , never getting where it was supposed to end up , but just going . The places I thought of ? with my head on the track like somebody who was trying to commit suicide when the train came or who was just practicing for it ? were only one or two of them in japan : the city on fire , which I blanked out because it did n't interest me , and the road where I drank the bottle of wine . The track to the north ? really , that 's all I wanted ? went up into the snow and over the frozen water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a record of it and called it " Frozen Water , " people would 've believed that 's what it meant . The sound was nothing , but the listening was level , dead level , like  | looking over a lake of blue ice that did n't have the other side . There would n't be any animal tracks on it , but maybe snow falling . I put snow there , and it was twice as good , twice as much as what it was . I got up , and pictures of lakes and the tundra faded ; the muskeg went , and I leaned back against the cutbank . I decided to follow the track , but not walk along it , where it would be easier to get trapped . I climbed out , and keeping the edge of the cutbank in sight , started to work forward through the trees . They were wide apart , and most of them were big ; there were lots of cones and needles on the ground . As I went on they seemed to take on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them up . It was wet ? not soaked , but wettish . I did n't like that , but went on anyway , checking the bark of the trees . They were all like that , wet on them when the air had condensed . And it was warmer , too . How could that be ? The sky was overcast with light gray clouds , fast cold-looking ones , and the woods were not still , sumpish ; there was air from behind , moving with me into the sick-feeling trees . I went on , the land dropping . As this happened I began to feel like there was something ahead of me : something concentrated , stopped up , maybe , something I probably would n't like . The more the land dropped , the more I felt this , until what had caused the feeling came at me , almost not there , as dim as it was , but there just the same , shifting a little with the air as it climbed out of itself , spread , still climbing but thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was steam . No wonder the trees are sick , I thought , inhaling the stuff that had always made me queasy , and was doing it now . There was a town in the midst of it . I could see some low houses when the air moved , and something came back to me  | from the briefings on Tinian . The Nips like heat , the intelligence officers told us . They live from one steam bath to the next one , and they 'd stay in steam and sweat all their lives if they could . I looked around then , and the situation made sense : the village , the steam , and the railroad . None of the trees had been cut . That meant the steam was made by either coal or wood , and I was fairly sure that it was wood , from the smell of the steam , which I should have noticed before but probably did n't want to believe when I first picked it up . How could anybody live like this , I wondered , half sick still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees around him to be wet , unless it was rain ? Or the leaves or the rocks ? I knew it from what I saw , and from my breath . Nobody should have to live like this . It was all wrong , I was sure . They did n't deserve the world . I put my eyes on into the steam , farther and farther , using the wind shifts that moved the heavy air to one side or the other . Whenever it happened I tried to get some notion about how big the town was and how it was laid out , how I could get past it the easiest . No matter how hard or how long I looked , I could n't make out a lot , there was so much of that warm , feathery fog hanging down . There were no people in it that I could see . They were probably in the buildings , wallowing in hot water , hoping they never had to get out . If that was so , it was good from my standpoint , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way I do things is to concentrate real hard on the first part of a problem that leads to another part , and then bear down on the next one , the same way , when I get to it . Sometimes you find yourself in a situation where it 's better not to think , but just to let go of everything and ride ? there 's a split second when you tell your brain to go out of you and something  | else in yourself takes over . You do n't have to worry anymore ; it 'll all work out . This was not one of those times , though , and I boned down on what choices I had and what advantages I could give myself . I had to get past the town ? that was first . I could pull back and go around it , which would have taken some time , but I could have done it . I could try to walk through at night . I doubted if there 'd be an electric light in the place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . But somehow that did n't suit me all that much . The situation might give me a chance to do something really interesting , something it called out of me , and that I ought to do . My mind kept coming back to the train , and I thought of open freight cars full of logs : logs laid in the same direction as the tracks . I thought about being carried along , too . I had been walking long enough ; I had just as soon ride for a while . I decided to give the train one more day . Even though there was a lot of stuff on the tracks and between them ? cones , needles , leaves , branches , pieces of bark , twigs ? there were some things you could guess about as a result ; they gave you something to hash over . Either the tracks were not used at all , and the railroad had just been left there to the weather , or they were still used , but had n't been for at least a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best , because the banks had n't crumbled , or at least not much , and even though it did n't look as though anybody had been to much trouble to keep them up , they had not just been let go , either . Again , one more day , I said . I really wanted the train to come . I looked forward to it , up there on the station platform of pine cones and wet rocks . I slept most of the afternoon , feet in my feathers , and then  | went down and listened to the tracks again . Still nothing . The lake of ice went farther and farther in my brain , the far shore of it did , and never ended , because the no-sound of it never quit , and the sound of the no-sound . I had n't realized how tired I was , and went back to sleep as the moon , which had halved itself going through a cloud , or gave me the notion that it might have done it that way , rose over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from me toward the village until they got to looking like needles , points of light that would go through anything . I woke up hungry . It was barely light , and I lay like I used to do , topping the Brooks Range looking south , when it got warm there , as warm as it ever got . There was something about Japan that bothered me , now more than before . In all these woods , among the trees , under them , in them , and over them , there were not many birds , and I had n't seen any animals at all . The ones in my head got stronger , though ; stronger because of the absence of the others . Luck or not , I could n't tell you . But I believe in luck , which sometimes you can push and sometimes just comes , even when it does n't have to . Blind-side luck I do n't count on much , but I did then , while I waited for the train . Once in the morning and another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the track and listened to the ice stretch away . Then , when the sun got down far enough so you could look right at it without blinking , I bent down again , and it was different . Inside the ice sound was another one , a steady beat with a wire hum through it . Not music exactly , but near . I lounged out on my belly and put one ear to the track and then the other , making sure . I laid my hand to the steel : there was not a quiver . I waited , and the humming waited . It must have taken an hour for it to get close enough for me to go up the  | bank , kneel on one knee behind a bush , and get ready for what would come . After a while it was there , the engine turning the curve real slow , like an animal at this time of day ? heavy twilight ? putting one foot after the other on strange ground , careful about noise . The engine went by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving past the curve into the straight . There were three closed cars , and the rest was open-car wood , some of it lashed but the logs of most of it stacked , the ends of the top ones pale as targets , coming under me and on by . I did n't think about it , but I knew what I would do . I picked up my bag of feathers and the other sack , waited for the engine to start around the next turn , took one long step and a short one , left the bank in the air and dropped to the logs , about ten cars back from the coal car . I landed solid , and sat down on a log , watching the bank and the trees on it ride sideways and backward , like I was sightseeing or something , even though there was nothing to surprise me ; I had been there . I knew how far it was to the town , and I knew I had time . But I kept on looking , anyway . I shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a position like I was in a chair , and crossed my feet like I might have done if I was in one , and kept watching the trees go by . I 've always been one to get comfortable , no matter where I was . I can take a piece of ground my size , or anywhere near it , a couple of rocks or branches or just my shirt or coat , and kind of arrange it myself , and if I 'm the least bit tired I 'll be asleep in five minutes . If , later on , the train went through the town and I stayed with it , I already knew which logs I would lie down between , and how I would put my feet and head , so as to sleep with the position , and add the train 's motion to make it better and deeper . I looked  | forward to that , because I had been on a train once before , going to Colorado , and I remembered how good the sleep was . But now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a little light left in the high branches . We slowed , and must have been close to the town . I was going in amongst the logs when I glanced back up one more time , and something , some part of a shadow , moved , not catching any light , but with the shape of a body to it . I just caught a glimpse , like part of the new dark , a kind of a blot that went from one limb to another , but I saw it had legs and a tail , though I could n't make out the head . Something like a marten , about the same size , from what I could tell . A fisher cat ? it could have been that big . But that thing went through my heart like a charge of buckshot , I can tell you , and those logs around me , that whole train , lit up . You get those charges sometimes , and the charge has got more power to it ? a lot more ? when you know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you from a real place , that it 's got the truth in it , and the whole truth . The train slowed more , and kept on slowing . I went amongst the logs for real then , pushing this way and that way , finding which logs I could move , what I could make them do . It was like building a blind . The arrangement had to look natural , but for this it had to look arranged , too , like the logs had been put in the car that way ? not too arranged , though , because nobody except maybe the Germans would have logs in perfect formation . It was lucky for me , in a way , that the logs were as heavy as they were , because I like to change things around when I get the chance . I go on the notion that anything can be better than it is ; you can really make it better . But there was not much I could do or , really , that I needed to do . I wedged one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as much as I could , so that I could  | slide in and down and out of sight . I did what I could to make sure the top log would n't roll back and pin me in there , because if I got trapped and they tumbled the logs out I would be mashed up pretty good . But , like I say , I did what I could , and got down . It was not bad there , and I waited until the train stopped . It was dark now , and I turned my listening on full power . I did n't have much idea about how you unload logs , but the station side of the car probably unhooked and let down , and the logs rolled onto the platform , or onto whatever carried them off from the station . I did n't think they would do my car first because of where it was , but , even though I did n't hear any grinding of steel or logs bumping or anybody 's voice , I still thought I ought to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hawks . I eased up out of my wood hole , and then up over the side of the car , tilted , getting just one eye clear . Even that way it was warmer , blurred , still ? no air , or might as well not be any . I hated to think what it must be like inside the houses : little people , mainly women and old men , most of the women dumpy and fat , slick with soap and sweat and pouring stagnant water on themselves and each other , dim lights flickering on them , chattering with a lot of teeth , most rotten . What an enemy ! Four or five men were down the platform from me . A vehicle like a weapons carrier was backing and angling alongside the train , and I ducked again when I heard metal on metal ? a short sharp groan ? and a load of logs rolled and bumbled down . It was time for me to move , and keeping as low as I could , I went up over the opposite side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbowed and slid under the train , coming out on my back , facing into the bolts , rolled a foot or so away and listened .  | How long ? I could n't say , because I did n't want to move . I mean , I did n't want to move a little and stay where I was ; if I was going to stay I wanted to be as still as I could . The thing that bothered me was that I did n't have any plan . I did n't know what I was going to do , either there or when I got up . I did n't like where I was , because there were too many uncertain things about it , but I could n't think of any reason to get out , or any place to go if I did . I looked at the bolts and rods , and their arrangement , to see if I could get anything back . Nothing hit me from the way they were ; they were just there . Then it was all solved . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought I was dead before I could move . It only went a foot or two forward , just enough to change the bolts and rods over me . It was fast enough , though . The next jump might do me in . Or if the train started and was dragging something along underneath it , that would be the end , sure enough . I rolled out the same way I had come in . It was real dark where I was , and I could n't make out a thing . I had n't even looked on that side of the train when it was moving , and now I had to feel around , first along the car and then behind me . There was a bank about ten feet away , and when my eyes got a little better adjusted I saw that I could get up on it from that side better than from the other , and decided that 's what I 'd do when the time came . But what now ? I could stand there , I could sit , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait a while ? how long ? ? roll under the train , check for feet and noise , and then , if things seemed clear , move out and look around . About then , there was a long scratching screech of metal ? which I was sure had plenty of rust in it ? and I heard the logs from a car down the line rumble and hash . They unloaded one car after the other ,  | coming along toward where I was , but two cars down from me they quit . They were near enough for me to hear voices , and after the banging and wood-whooming of the logs going down into the carriers , everything got quiet again . This might be good . If they did n't come back it meant that the rest of the wood was supposed to be dropped off somewhere else , that the train would go on . Another thing : a feeling came through the side of the train that the business on the other side had been finished . I ca n't tell you how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took the chance and went under the car again . I could see the wheels of the carrier and a few feet shuffling around it , like feet of people who are pushing something , and then everything was gone , and dead quiet was with me . I hedged out , edging on my elbows , cleared the train , and backed up against the car . The carrier , full of logs too big for little men , was just going around a corner . The men were bunched far up toward the engine , but nobody looked at me . I separated myself from the train just then , before anybody could see me there , or see me leaning , walked by a couple of buildings , shuffling , and into a street . Underfoot was dirt ; there was almost no sound , either from me or anything else . A light over one of the buildings might as well not have been there . The windows had wooden shutters on them , and at least two were boarded up and nailed . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bent over , and not talking or , as far as I could tell , looking at me or even at each other . I did n't have the slightest bit of anxiety , and had n't had any ever since I got on the train . I went along like the others did , and as far as it mattered to the town , it did n't seem as if I was any different from the other shadows . I did n't feel as if I belonged there , exactly ? that would have been hard ? but nobody was  | interested enough in me , even as an enemy , to break whatever routine they were used to . I turned another corner . Down the street , which had two lights on it instead of one , there might be , I believed I could tell , something a little more worth my time . Still listening for the train to whistle , or to grind its wheels or bang its cars together , I bent and foot-dragged along toward the lights . There was something different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , was on the ground , and came from one of the buildings . When I got to it the window was not boarded , but heavy-steamed glass . No one was looking in . No one was on the street anywhere . I went back and forth along the glass , trying to get my eyes through the steam . I could n't at first , and then I found a place where the glass had been rubbed across from the inside , maybe by somebody 's back or shoulder , and the heat had n't had a chance to thicken up again yet . I could make out forms there . No , one form . It was getting dimmer as I watched , dimmer and dimmer , but the energy of my focus on it made it last a little longer , maybe , than it would have any other way . A naked girl was standing on the other side of a pool , facing me . I had n't seen a woman naked since I was a civilian , back at Point Barrow just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl from Kansas working with the Unuluk Eskimos one summer who took up with me because she thought I could get her out into the country around the Brooks Range , and other places she could n't make it to on her own . I told her she was trying to fuck herself on up through the tree line . That was all right with her , she said ; better than all right . She was a good enough girl in some ways , strong and smart , with calves like a couple of kegs ; she could walk . But I did n't take her , as it turned out . I was going into the Air Force , and  | did n't plan to go back out on the tundra before I enlisted , to keep from getting drafted . As I say , she was the last before this , and she was not bad . A naked woman in a room with you , one who you can see from both sides at the same time ? the Kansas girl liked to stand in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her while I looked at her face-on from an angle ? is right there with you ; she was double there , you could say . But the Japanese girl was dissolving , disappearing , going away for good into steam , but still in front of me for just a minute more . She could not have been stranger if she 'd been standing in powder snow ? snow as fine as flour ; no , finer than flour ? or in a cloud . Her face was toward me . Her eyes were more or less on a level with mine . There was not any way she could see me , but I bet she felt me ; I was concentrating on her feeling me . She picked up a bucket , filled it with water from the pool , and poured the whole bucket over her head . I could n't see the water run down . All I could make out was an explosion of steam without any noise where her head was . She lifted her arms straight up and shook herself ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water ran down into her bush . I did n't see that that was where it ran , but it would have . The dark place , there at the middle of her , was the last of her I saw before the cloud was solid with cloud , and I turned and went back the way I came . When I cleared the first corner and did n't see anybody , I had the thought to straighten up , and I did . Until the train came in sight I went along like I usually would , and did n't even change when I passed another bunch of shuffling shadows . I eased right on by them , walking American . After the dark of the streets , I thought that the place where  | the train had stopped would be lighter , but it was not . It was just as dark : dark up toward the engine , dark under the wheels . It could have been stretched along one of the streets buried behind me , maybe where the one window was , but on back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like it did now . All at once , when I was about twenty-five yards from it , the train jerked . It settled , then jerked again . I thought fast . I might make it from the dark of the street to the dark of the train , then under and , when I started , back up onto it from the street side and in amongst the logs where I 'd been . But if I tried to scale the side of the car from the near side , I 'd be a lot more likely to be seen . If there was one eye in that town pointed even anywhere near my direction , that would be the end of it . On the other hand , if the train was getting ready to start out , under the wheels would be the last place to be . But if I wanted the train ? which I did , because I believed I understood it , that in a sense it did n't mind me , and was even in favor of me ? I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crossing the dirt between the buildings and the train was only four or five steps , and in the last step I was already rolling . That 's one of the good things you learn in Basic Training : how to roll . And I never rolled better ; old Sergeant Brickley would have been proud of me . I was under the same car , staring hard at the bolts and rods again , when the train jerked ? jumped , this time ? and I thought sure I was gone . I wondered where the blood was spurting and why I was not paining yet . But nothing touched me , and the train was still again . I was paralyzed for a second , but I shook it off and scrambled out the other side . I took hold of the metal slats of the car , and it pulled on my hand ? pulled and kept on pulling . I was n't worried , though , be-  | cause no train starts fast . I walked along beside it , holding on , then ran a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the car until trees came in around me . It did n't take long for that to happen , but before we got all the way clear of the town , a guy I did n't make out until it was too late looked up from the roadbed and saw me . He pointed and hollered , almost close enough for me to kick him , but I did n't try , because we were picking up speed now , and there was nothing he could do about it . We were gone before I could have kicked ; I could have caught him a good one if I 'd of seen him in time . When we were in the full night dark I climbed back up . My swan bag was right there , and the other . The log I 'd been able to move , so that I could either use it as part of a chair or get in under it and stretch out , was in the same position ; the only question was whether I wanted to ride sitting or go to sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood next to me out into the tops of trees , out into the sky , which was clear and flying . The first thing that came into my mind , then , was how long this could go on . In my situation there were not many things I could be sure of , and it was good , every now and then , to check ? to check in with ? the ones I knew would n't change , and would be with me if I used them right . Up through the logs I looked for the North Star , but from that position I could n't make it out . I broke loose my emergency pack , pulling the tape off my side , and got out the compass . I put it on a log and hiked around so I could look at it straight . As little as it was , the dial was easy to read , and I propped up on an elbow and watched the needle hold steady as the train went around one curve after another , and farther north . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | tell you . I still had a lot of the dirt and leaf mold I had put on me , back at the lake , to camouflage myself on the hills , the brown slants and valleys , and it gave me a very right feeling to know that the logs and I were the same color , or just about . Nobody was going to be fooled by it where I was , riding by myself through the woods ; nobody else knew it . But I knew it , and took my pleasure , on and on , a long time for lots of miles . I could n't sleep , did n't really want to . I sat up in the chair position and watched the trees rush . If you put your eyes to one place and things keep flying by you , your brain starts to change . I 've felt it happen before , on takeoff in the 29 , or sometimes when we landed , though when you 're tired it does n't work as well ; you 're not interested in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , I had never been more interested . That may have been because I was in woods . There was the mix between me and the trees that there always is . It did n't bother me that I did n't know which birds and animals were there , or even what some of the trees were . Back before the town I had seen a body move from one limb to another , and that was enough for me ; I would come back to it . It would be better now , I thought , while I did n't have any problems right on top of me , to give my mind some kind of rest . Not sleep , maybe , but just by letting anything come into it that wanted to , anything I remembered , anything I thought was good or bad , anything I could make up or that had stayed with me for whatever reason it might have . I put the compass away and leaned forward into the rushing of the trees . The riding itself was first . Rocking through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted to myself finally that I did n't like to fly ; I had n't ever liked it . In a plane there is not enough of a sense of ? well , what would you say ? ? of riding .  | Not nearly enough . I had plenty of that now , which was maybe why I was happy . I was in the middle of a stream of trees , and out into the snatching blackness of it I could put anything I wanted to , anything of my life , anything of anybody else 's . Where was the pull of the snow ? I asked myself . Right where it had always been ; I did n't even have to feel for it . We turned another curve , and the compass needle fixed itself just as much due north in my mind 's eye as it had when I 'd been looking right at it , on the log . We were going there . Which snow , what part of it ? What was in it ? I saw the caribou moving out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into my face , staying on my closed eyes like another kind of fire , made the focus of my mind 's eye ? or eyes , maybe ? a lot sharper than it usually was . I could make out anything I wanted to as the horns came out of the trees : first one big bull , and the others after him , giving up dark for open snow , their herd-heads going lower as they moved free , where the danger was , where the danger might be . I did n't have a gun , in my mind ; did n't want one . I pulled in close to the lead bull and watched his eyes , as big as a buffalo 's , to see what he might be looking for . I knew he could n't see me , but just looked on through , onto the snow beyond . I stayed where I was and he walked through me ; the rest of them , too ; the whole herd went through me , and it was a nice feeling to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , I thought , if riding on top of these logs can make me see things that are that pleasing , and with sight that strong , the train was the right place for me to be . I had all that pleasure of the herd going through , with those big eyes not having the slightest notion of what was going on . I thought that later I would bring up some other things I liked and knew about . But first I had to do what I could to solve a couple of  | problems , so I could go back full-time to the wind and whatever it would bring me . I had all night , maybe longer . I pushed back and down into the logs , and brought up the good and the bad . The good , or part of it , was that the train was going north , and every minute I was getting closer to the snow and the mountains . It sure beat walking , I can tell you , even though I liked walking and snowshoeing better , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the train to carry me as far as I could manage . How far would that be ? And how long ? I did n't have any idea of where any of the other towns were , the ones that the train was supposed to service . But there was plenty of wood on board , and I thought it was more or less reasonable to believe that the towns were not real close to each other , or else the people would all have got together in the same place . I doubted if we would unload any more at night , though of course maybe we would . That was the thing that bothered me most : I would go to sleep and the train would pull in somewhere and people would come climbing all over the logs and find me . I needed sleep , though , and it was warm where I was . I put my feet in the feathers again , and tried to see if I could bring up any more problems . There would be plenty later , but right now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making around forty or forty-five miles an hour , I felt like I could go to sleep with the motion of the train , hoping I would wake up if the speed slacked off , and get down onto the ground again and into the woods before they gave out and cleared away for a town . I put all the good and bad out of my mind , kept all pictures out , and was gone in a minute , not dreaming . I woke up in four hours , and it was still dark . As far as I could tell we had n't stopped anywhere ; that part of things had been lucky . I felt very good , even though I was a little hungry . But I  | was rested , and we had made a lot more miles , all of them north . I decided to keep my head down and try to think more forward in time . I had made up my mind to get to the north island , Hokkaido , and I would have to cross at night , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to make , rowing or paddling a kayak or whatever I would be able to find and steal . There would n't be any kayaks , but I can make better time paddling than rowing : paddling on both sides with a double blade . I could see something like that happening , but I needed the wind . I wanted to call up water for just a second , to make sure of one thing . Then I would go back to it for what I knew it would bring me , that I wanted more than any water that ever was . I raised myself up , and the air hit me with that one big , ongoing cold push , and I was hunkered down in the snow in white fur with my eyes ready to close if anything I did n't like showed . This surprised me , because I thought I would be in the air somewhere , up over a mountain or maybe a glacier , like something in a dream , something that needed meat . But I stayed , and watched . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over me , and there was no way to tell , except for the feel of the wood bark under my hand , whether I was moving through trees with the thing I was on making the wind , or whether I was still , with the wind running toward me over the snow , and maybe the snow making and sending it . I could sec the snow of the tundra just as well as I could make out the trees of the woods in Japan ? or maybe could see it better , for it was closer to how I felt and what I wanted . I gave all I had to the snow , and it was there , in a long slope lying forward from a foothill , with about two hundred yards of level ground between me and the beginning of the slant . Marmot ? No , hare . That  | would make me white , in my waiting . There was no lynx anywhere I could see , but the possibility of one somewhere around rayed out and around me like electricity . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide . And there are ways of doing it that are better than others . When you hide without any cover , without any concealment except the way you are , and the country around you is like you , and there 's not any difference that anything but you could tell between you and where you are , then you 're in another place from where you seem to be : a place that 's completely yours , and will be as long as you lie still . You amount to more than color , there , more than your fur or your skin the color of the country , because when you close your eyes ? all you have to do is close your eyes ? you 're gone from that place , too , not in it anymore . You 're the same as it , the same as it is . I did n't close my eyes , but slitted them down to be as near to being completely gone as I could and still see , and waited in the wind for the lynx I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw him , though , and the wind died , then came up again and was water , and ice was over me . I was still again , but in another way , with the wind in the form of a current . I could feel the curves of it in front of me and behind me ? where I had been and where I was going ? and I was hanging in a kind of hoisted standoff with it , holding what I had , keeping my head into it , maintaining . It was not as good as hiding in the open ? white in white ? but it was good in its way . I was in the dark , almost dead dark , but I knew that ice was over me , and snow over that , and there was a place right at the forward limit of what I could make out that looked like it might be a hole , and I moved up on it . Moving was easy ; the resistance of the current made it easier ;  | all I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face split it to the heart . When I got under the hole I took up my kind of hanging-there again , and looked up past the jagged edge of the ice straight into the blue sky . For a second the other sky came back to me , the one that had been on a level with me , that I watched change into a round hole with two stars in it , at the end of the pipe where I had hid on the Tokyo docks before the big raid , damn near dying of shit gas , of waiting for the fire to fall . That went away , and I was clean again in the current , my eyes on the blue through the ragged ice . I went on , like a bullet with a long jaw , on and on , bending with the curves , straightening and hunting , hanging when I wanted to , where I felt like it . There are a lot of things people do n't understand about fish : how everything in the world looms up , looms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish 's eye cuts it out sharp when the thing just wants to be a dim shape , and loom , and you wo n't have it that way . A fish 's eye cuts things into clean outlines and then lets them go back to being dim when he 's through with them , when he goes on past . And there 's always the feeling of slotting through , but you never touch the sides of the slot . As I say , there are a lot of good things about it , but hard to talk about . And then I was back on land , and had flowers on me , gray-and-black flowers all over , and claws as long as a man 's hand . I had weight again , but not as much as you 'd think for my size : i f I 'd been any lighter I would not have left any prints on the snow . I went over it , looking for eyes . I ate almost nothing but hares , hares on their big feet like snowshoes , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white . My ears tingled in the wind , and the air above my ears , as I carried my gray flowers ,  | one foot after the other , looking for something in the field to disappear , two things together , to go out like candles . I was waiting like floating . My marks were like a ghost had made them , or the next thing to it . The wind did all that , made it for me ? the snow , the water , and what I was in them ? when I gave myself all the way into what I wanted most , in the places where I wanted it . For the longest time , maybe most of the night , the train did n't make any sound , or I could n't have told you if it did . Every now and then , while my mind and the solid air were still making the snow , I would watch the trees with nothing there but them , no pictures in between . Then the sound of the train would come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the wavers in the track would rise up through the logs , and the logs would be real , the way they were sliding longways through the other trees . What I really wanted was to see the shape , the shadow , move through the branches , like it had done before we stopped in the town . It had been there . It was , I can tell you , a real animal in real trees , and not one that I got out of the wind and laid over the woods and the dark sky . Mostly the trees were just a black wall going by , sometimes almost close enough to touch , I 'd have bet , but a wall that quivered like it had an engine behind it , or something that was trying to get through . Whatever the animal was , I could n't see it in that wall . It was when there was a break in the trees , and the sky showed between them , that I looked the hardest for whatever it was to take the leap across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , back there , but believed I remembered that it was bigger , a lot bigger , than a squirrel , and bigger than a marten , but not as thick in the body or heavy as a wolverine . It might have been about the size of a  | fisher ? a black cat , like my father used to say . I was watching for something about that size . I do n't know why I thought I would see it again , but I did think so . I even felt like the whole situation owed it to me to show me whatever it was in a long jump ? a short one would have done ? where the trees got loose from each other for a second , and I could make it out . I felt that if that happened there was nothing in the world that I could n't do , no place I could n't get to , nothing I could n't eat or fuck or kill , whatever . Finally , though , I let the wind give me back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , like before . It was night now , another night . Snow again , a slope down to a long valley almost like a tunnel . Caribou were in it again , moving through the valley , but I was not one of them . I was on a hill with some others like me , watching them , waiting for the time to move about a mile to the floor of the valley , going down in twos and threes when the stragglers fell back , and we knew it enough . We went when it was time , faster and faster down the slant , the snow not breaking under us , eye-first into the wind we made , and cut out a calf . The others came up , and we sat around looking at each other while the rest of the herd disappeared . I did n't call up the eating part , because it would have made me hungry , there on the train , and I did n't want that when I could n't do anything about it . Even though it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Japan wind , I felt the stillness we were in , sitting in the snow with the blood and the down calf in that valley in Alaska , and finally I did what the others did , and howled . I thought , Why not do the same thing here ? Why not join up with what I had in my mind right then ? Who would hear me ? And so there , on the train , I howled , putting riny head hack like I should have clone . I do n't know how long I kept it up .  | but I was raised on that sound , and even though I do n't remember that I 'd ever tried it before , I 'm sure it was not too much different . Nobody would hear me , and it might do some good . I believed it did , anyway , and I kept it up for a while . Then I was white , and hunting again , but for something smaller . I was not like the lynx anymore , but was after something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my mouth , in my whole body ? my body that borrowed something from snakes ? that was stronger than anything in life , that had more power than the sun and the moon shining together . It was not just being hungry ; it was way more than that , a lot more necessary . It was the taste , it was the color of it , the heat . It was what it came from : something alive and now not , the steam rising out of it before you tore it apart to eat . Everything about it was enough to drive you crazy , but you like it and want more , have to have it and will do anything to get it , will go for the color and the heat and the steam a long time after you 've eaten all you want , and more . As soon as all the blood was out , you go looking for the next one , to do it again . You ? I ? Who ? What had me was more than I was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All I could do was what it said . " I'he dizziness did n't leave me , and the need did n't leave me , but I was bigger , and not white anymore . I was as strong as a bear and could climb like a squirrel . I was climbing , was not in the snow anymore , looking for mice and rabbits . A dead tree this time . Most of the branches were gone , but a few at the top , a nest . I climbed up and looked in . There was a big bird , dead white , live white , with black speckles on his chest . He pulled back to the rim of the nest as I pushed in . I saw he could n't fly ? was too young maybe , as big as he was ? but the wings went out  | anyway , a spread that covered up everything in white feathers , and I fired my head at him . I stumbled into the air , because it did n't matter whether I could fly or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the swaying , was the eyes over the teeth , and then they were gone , and so was the nest . In Japan the trees rushed clear ? rushed , swept , I do n't know ? and one more time I looked for a four-legged shadow to cross the open air , to show for a second against the clean sky . If there was ever going to be the right time it was now , when I was falling in Alaska , tumbling , like when I bailed out over Tokyo , and yet not like it . Nothing crossed , and the trees flashed solid again . But in Alaska I was still falling , and hope was going . Inside the hopelessness , though , was something else that had just come into it , but had been there , too , in some kind of way . I jolted , a little like when the parachute had opened , but it was better this way . The chute had saved my life , but this was better ? better , believe me , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , long wings left and right , the color of snow , the color of cloud , and I was not falling but riding , riding over the whole frozen earth , whiteness everywhere under me , the land pushed up in hills and mountains , the rivers like white roads made out of white , going through white , the woods covered with snow , all hanging , all hanging with me , and pure , the whole earth as pure as it could get , and still , real still . All I heard was the air I was in , the wind holding me up in myself , over everything . Pure air : pure : pure . Pure riding . I looked up , and white cloud was there . Where I was , the clouds did n't have to be dark to snow , and these were not dark , but it was snowing , and I climbed up through it on air that was doing it for me , riding , rising , not moving a wing , to be inside the cloud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was everywhere , wanting to fall on something and kill it , fall all the way down , maybe thousands of feet : fall but not yet , because I was riding . I was riding in snow and on snow , in the whiteness where whiteness counted for the most it could . It held me that way , and I was riding . Something under me ? everything ? jumped , and I woke up . Somehow or other I had got down amongst the logs again , and even had my feet in the bag of feathers . The train was jerking and slowing , and there was a little light , more than I should have let come . I did n't have any idea of when I 'd gone to sleep , but I must have settled down without knowing it , and one of the logs had rolled part of the way over me , balancing on others , so that I had to struggle a good bit to get out . The train had slowed down even more , was jerking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because I did n't want to risk another town , and this one in daylight . I hated to leave the train , in a way , and I hoped I could remember some of the things that had come to me out of the wind . Before I dropped off I lifted my head and tried it one more time , but I could hardly feel the air move past ; that part of things was over . I did get one last flicker , though , just before I jumped . It was of a whole lot of deer heads . Just the heads , eit her because the bodies of the deer were buried in the snow or because the heads had been cut off and lined up . They were in a long row going out of sight , and if I had wanted to put a name on it , or maybe had the notion of making a picture out of it , I would have called it " Deer Head for Infinity , " or something cisc just as crazy . I dropped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my bags and headed into the trees , feeling great . It was rocky where I was now ; everything for me was uphill . I  | went up over the rocks , big ones and , in between them and on top of them , a lot of little ones that would move and slip if you so much as touched them , seemed like . It was a place where you had to pay a lot of attention to what you were doing , where you put your hands and feet , and I did pay it , because a fall on that stuff would have been bad . I did n't mind skinning my knees or elbows , but I damn well did n't want to break anything . That would have put me out of commission , sure enough . At the beginning I was careful ? more than that . Since my bailout I had lost some weight from all the walking , and from not having much to eat , and I could tell it , going up the rocks . I could jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my knees did n't bend as much as they would have before . And I believed I could run faster , too . For some reason , on those jumbled-up rocks the thought came to me of the flat land on the south of the Brooks Range , and the way I would run in the late spring , the first day I got off snowshoes . That was a wonderful time for me , when it seemed like half my weight was gone , and I could just fire out full blast down the valley with nothing to stop me , nothing to keep me from going faster and faster , until there was not any limit to me , and my feet damn near left the ground . Going up the rocks a little at a time was like that , though I could n't tell you why . It 's just the way you think at certain times , I guess , and the way you feel when you 're doing it . After a while I noticed ? it was kind of a surprise ? that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put my feet anymore , but was going along just the same , with the rocks more or less cooperating with me , if you know what I mean . I topped out , and stayed low . In front of me was a poor-looking valley , more like a gully or a draw , and then another ridge of hills , probably pretty much like the one I was on . Even with the  | rising mood I had , and the advantages of the lighter weight , I was fairly tired from all the climbing , and it came to me that I had not been scanning what was around me nearly enough . I took a good sweep now , before I started down . Far off to the left a small shape with legs , probably not a woman , was moving along the floor of the draw , and I sat down behind a rock until it went out of sight , carrying a bundle that bent the man almost double . He went , and after him I looked for the south side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May . But it was not quite that late in Japan , and that would work for me where I was going . I was in the valley left and right , though , and the main need I had was to run , because I could n't believe I had n't just stepped off snowshoes . A few steps , maybe . I did it , and was picking up speed . I had what I wanted , and was getting more . But my own speed scared me . I did n't know what I was doing ; a few more steps and I would have really been gone . But I did n't give my speed a chance , a real chance , to take me out of control , and slowed down in time . I was breathing hard , harder than the running would have caused , and I looked right and left again , and then onto the next slope , rocky like the last one , and steeper . I could n't help it : I ran at the bank and went up over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , and would stay , so that I could do the same thing again if I ever came back . From those first rocks I lifted , springing like , on and on , not looking at the top or anywhere around me , or even at the next rock that would come to my foot , and for a little while , I swear , I did it with my eyes closed . But then something told me that this was like running on the floor of the draw , that it was dangerous , and I ought to cut it out : slow down , not be crazy , at least not here .  | When I slowed and stood on a pointed rock , my feet holding toward each other like pliers , but slanted , I was pulling in the air again by the buckets . It filled me to the brim with that place , and I was happy to be there . But when I got hold again and took a sight on what was in front of me and above me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the slope was more like a mountain , and it would have been hard to do any jumping from then on . And , believe me , I did n't plan to close my eyes again , either . So I went up . It was cold and overcast : pleasant cold , not the real stuff , and I started to sweat a lot . I was having to use my hands as well as my feet to climb , and though the hill did n't get any steeper , after I was about halfway , it did seem to stretch out and get higher , and it took me most of an hour to get to where I was , even near the top . I had hold of myself real well , though , and kept looking back and down , and tried to keep behind the biggest rocks whenever I could , so that I would n't be visible for more than half the time . The notion of what might be on the other side of the hill started to get stronger , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three more days without anything to eat , I would end up in bad shape , and might have to do something I ought not to . I could n't make more than a couple of miles a day going along like this , and I could n't do anything at night at all ; I 'd just have to hole up . But I was getting close to the top of this particular hill , and that buoyed me up some . The light had changed , and it was afternoon , the sun out now and headed for the level where the top of the hill was . It kept striking off the rocks I was climbing , or was about to climb , like it was brushing over them , and then would come around and brush over them again . But on one it stopped , and even though  | I was ready to go by , I stopped when the light did . It was not on a big rock , either , but on one that stuck out of the yellow dirt at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I straightened up , took some more air , bent down , touched it , and pulled on the part that was showing . It came up without any trouble , and I sat down and went over it , brushing off the dirt . It was a bone , a human pelvis , and there was not any doubt about it . That 's a damn strange thing to be inside of somebody , I said to myself . And it was , and is . What I know about skeletons has to do with animals and fish , and I had never seen anything like this except in the medical and first-aid books my father kept in the cabin . But there the thing was , with the sun leveling onto it and then into it and through it , and it hit me that I could turn it ? I was right there , and no one else ? so that the light would come down through the hole in it and make a shape on the ground , on the slant yellow dirt of the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would 've thought . Bone , damn sure . It had the feel , as it was in my hands , of something that had belonged in life . Where was the head ? Where was the rest of it ? I could n't see any other parts , but that was not really something I was interested in . I took a good long look at what I had , and at the sun through the hole , which seemed to burn up a point on the ground . I saw something there , felt something . I remembered , at Barrow , the Eskimo women pounding for needles . Would this be possible ? Bone , all hone ; bone is bone ; I would need to be able to do it . I positioned the pelvis . There was a rock ? it could have been any rock , anywhere . There was another rock , and there was not anything to say I could n't put the pelvis down and hit it with another rock , or that the whole thing would n't splinter into needles I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what I could get :  | winter clothes for where I was going to go , no matter what . Most of the things that live have got bones , which was a good thought . I socked it . Nothing . Crumbs . And one half-assed piece , a kind of triangle , that I could n't help thinking was telling me to fuck off , it was no use . And it was n't . I had a bad time right then . I could remember , but I could n't remember enough . It was in that dim light , through the ice ? the ice window , the ice panels , an igloo with burlap ? that I could still see it : the old woman Ungalikuk , I think her name was , sewing what she was sewing , but I did n't have what she had . My attention , my interest , had not been strong enough . There was no use trying to bust up a pelvic bone , it just would n't work . I was ashamed of myself . Needles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . But I had learned something I had n't thought I 'd learn , even so . It would have to be the long bones , where the grain ran right , not the center of things , not where the body hung together . Leg bones . Or arms , maybe . They would carry the needles . I got up and dusted off my hands , climbed over the ridge and a little way down the other side of it , and picked up my heading . I went on like that , not making very good time . I slid a couple of times , not bad slides , or long , but bothersome , because I had got so self-conscious about breaking a foot or a leg , I would have done just about anything to keep from it . Finally I went down on the road , because there was nobody around , and I did n't see any reason not to . I walked on the flat road for ahu , ut two hours , and made maybe five or six miles , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an engine . No , more than one , because the noise had that seesaw to it that you get when more than one engine is running . I went up the hill again to the  | next curve and got down behind some rocks , not big ones , but when I stretched out I was sure that nobody from the road could see me , especially with the up angle . It was a truck convoy , all the way out of sight and moving very slow . The trucks , about the size of a GI six-by-six , were covered with dust , and if the soldiers in them had wanted to camouflage them to look like the road , they could n't have done any better . When they were about halfway around the curve , the lead truck stopped , then all the others , one by one . A man got out of the first truck , went back to the second one , and said something to the driver , then to the third and on down the line . Wherever he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood around , waiting . They were as dusty as the road , but even with that , I could see that most of them were either old men or kids , though they were all in uniform . All the time I had been in Japan I had never seen a Japanese soldier whose uniform looked good on him . They were always too baggy or hung wrong in some way , and none of them was ever too small ; they were always too big . What that might mean I did n't have any idea , but these were worse than most , even . As far as I was concerned there had never been such a bunch of sad sacks in the world , trying to be an army . I'he original guy , the one from the lead truck , was taking his time , and I knew that until he came back the convoy would sit where it was , stuck in the dust . I was stuck , too , but like I usually do I tried to get some notion of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to steal a truck or some other type of motor transport , and it would be an advantage if I knew the soup from the driver 's standpoint . I scouted along the line , and fixed on the truck where I could see into the cab better than into any of the others . I could barely make out the gears , and would  | have to see the driver shift when he got back in , though I did n't think , really , that I would be able to pick up that much information , because the driver 's body would be in the way . I might get a glimpse of his hand shifting , and that would be something . Thinking that way , and waiting as the sun went on down and nothing happened , I tried to connect some of the few things I could remember that had to do with the Japanese and machinery . I did n't have to go far . I did n't need any more than anybody with good sense would have known : the Japanese love machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , especially Americans . If it were n't for us they would n't have any factories , any cars , much less any airplanes . I would have bet that the trucks had the same gearshift as an American make . Finally , after about an hour and a half , the head guy came back , got in the cab , and the convoy started to crawl . I kept my eyes on the one truck I 'd picked out , and sure enough I caught a flash of the driver 's hand as he upshifted , and it was exactly like I thought . He put the truck in third , and as far as I could tell kept it there . In a few minutes the end of the line went around the far curve and rolled through all the dust that the other trucks had stirred up . After the whole line had gone , the dust still hung there , lifting up little by little , though it never got as high as I was . Because I thought that maybe other traffic had built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I kept high and made what time I could , though it did n't amount to much . There was always the problem of night , and I did n't have any plan this time except to keep going as long as I could . I 'd always be able to bed down on the side of the hill , even if I had to dig out a place where I could lie level , and sleep with my feet in the hag of feathers . It was not something I looked forward to , but if  | that was the only way to go , I would do the best I could . I had been in worse places , because it was not really cold , not the kind of cold that I liked and could work with , but just kind of chilly , as people back in the States would say , and I would be able to sleep all right without any cover . It was coming on for dark , but I could still see well enough to move , and I went up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view as I could . As soon as I topped out , I was surprised . There were some lights ahead of me , not many , but definite , and split in the middle . If the ridge went on as it was doing , I could , when it got a little darker and if I took my time , go past the village on the slope , and then , if I wanted to , go down and see what was there . I was looking for certain things , wherever people lived . One of them was food , and in the last few days , based on what I had been doing , and bringing back the years on the trap lines , I had got more and more into a state of mind telling me it was best to look at myself like I was a machine that needed to be taken care of in certain ways . Sleep I could manage almost anywhere . But eating was different . Every day it was a new problem , and every night . I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did I would he too tired to do some of the things I might have to do , and some I might want to do . I came up on the village . The road ran through it and separated the groups of little lights , split them right in two like a river would have done . In about an hour I was past the town , and it was almost dark . The moon was just rising , and it was full , really beautiful . There was no need for me to try to stay under cover where I was , and I stood up straight , shook my swan bag until it evened out , checked the equipment taped onto me , saw that my knife was loose and hanging right , and went down toward the last light to the north .  | It was n't really the whole of dark yet . That would be in around fifteen minutes , or so I judged . When I got to the flat , I expected that there would be some people around , but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . There was not anybody , though , and I came on toward the house , the one house I had picked out , little by little . This time I did n't have any notion of flashing my blade on whatever light there might be inside ; I had already done that . I ducked behind a tree and tried to spot what I had an idea might be there . In the rising moon , a man came out of the house and went into the ground . That was what I had been looking for . The Japanese are big on caves . They had told us back on Tinian that the Japs can dig like moles , and will do it whether there 's any reason for it or not ? the old men , the women , and the kids . They store all kinds of stuff in caves , and where that man , as quiet as his shadow , went out of sight I knew there must be a cave . When he came out a few minutes later carrying two sacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong ones I had been making . Again I waited ; I was used to it . If the man needed something else , he would come back after it fairly soon , and when he did n't I would make my move , keeping low , in whatever shadows I could find . I would have to use my flashlight on this one , though I hated to waste the batteries or risk somebody seeing it . When I got to the hole in the ground , I saw a short ladder going down about three or four feet , and that under it the ground was level . I hesitated for a minute , because a man can get trapped in a place like that . I had to get in and get out fast ; there could n't be any fooling around . Following my beam down , I got to the floor and looked around . Sure enough , there were stacks of things , bags and big square tin cans . I did n't want to fool with the cans , but there was  | probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I picked one up , and could handle it . I tried another one , and it was n't any heavier , but made some kind of sound when I shook it , like leaves , dead leaves , and I thought maybe dried fish , the scales and all . That would be enough ; I would take whatever it was . I turned to the left and there were two human heads between me and the moon . I dropped the bags and put my hand on the knife . Someone was talking , and then someone else , and I could tell that they were kids , probably young ones , and they were looking right at me . I turned off my flashlight , left the bags , and started up the ladder . When I got to ground level , they had backed off , but they did n't run . That was good , real good . I went down the ladder again . The bags were made out of coarse thread , and if you could find a loose end , you could pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a section and knotted the ends together , then went back up where the kids looked as though they had n't moved a muscle . The moon was rising behind them , and I put my hands into the string and began to weave . I made the moves with as much motion , slow motion , as I could , like I was a magician or something , making passes over some kind of object or person , casting a spell , you might say . When you have lived as many winters as I have with no place to go except out on the sides of mountains and in fields full of nothing but snow , nothing but a few trees when you 're down low enough , and the only walls and roof you know are those in Vc ur own cabin where you live with your father , you pick up lots of ways to entertain yourself . My father had taught me how to make figures with string , designs and games . That was one of the things we did when we were not trapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making them pull the botdes around the floor . We even had teams of them , and ran races .  | But right now I was weaving a complicated design we called Jacob 's ladder , where , if you know how to do it , the string twines around itself , loops in and out and around , and comes out as a real interesting kind of ladder , like something that a combination of an engineer and an artist might have dreamed up . If you watch somebody do it , you ca n't tell what 's going on except that it 's a tangle of string , until right at the last ; that 's the best , and I was saving it . To get steady , I sat down on the ground so the kids could get close to the string , and as I got ready to make my last move , their breath was warm on my face . The moon was big now , real big , and I glanced up at it so they would do it , too . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big silver-blue moon caught in the ladder . The kids came closer , so they could see it just like I saw it , and then little by little I changed the position of my hands , so that the moon walked step by step from the bottom of the ladder to the top , and then out into space again . I got up , and without any fuss pulled the kids up , a boy and a girl . They were real little , not more than four or five , and I do n't know to this day why they had come out to the cave , because they could n't have moved anything in it . I put my finger on my lips , then went down the ladder and brought up the two bags . I took the string from around my wrist and put it around the neck of the bigger kid , the boy . They were both looking at me , and before they had been standing there too long , so that I would have to figure too much , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more time , gave them an easy push . I watched for just a second or so to see if they would run , but they did n't . I saw the boy reach for the string , and just as that happened I turned back to the road , walked on very fast with the bags until I was out of sight of the house , and then  | started up the hill , using my flashlight whenever I thought I ought to , and making good time for the conditions . In about half an hour I topped out over the ridge and went down the other side about twenty or thirty yards . When I came to a flat place I sat down and opened the bags with my knife . Sure enough , one of them was rice and the other was dried fish , cut up , heads and all . I ate a few pieces of fish , because I was damn hungry , and then some of the rice , raw . I wished I had had something to drink , because eating makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't anything , and I chewed the fish as much as I could to make it juice , but doing that made things worse , because of the salt . I put the bags on the downhill side , kicked open the sack of feathers , put my feet in , wrapped my arms around me with my hands in the pits , and went to sleep fast . The moon was like heat on my face . I do n't remember that I felt much chill that night . As the light began to come I woke up in a sweat that seemed to have been caused by the temperature in some way . I felt fairly bad , and I wondered if I was beginning to catch a cold . I did n't like that , because it meant that I would tire out easier . But the worst thing was the thirst . I was really very thirsty , thirstier than I had ever been in my life , except for the time when I ate some snow before my father could tell me not to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I thought the snow would just melt in my mouth and I would n't be thirsty anymore . You 've got to melt it another way , however you can find , he said . I knew now that I had better not eat any more of the fish , so I closed up the sack . The two bags were too heavy and bulky to carry for any distance , so I spent some time getting a reasonable amount of rice and fish slabs into one bag , sorting out the heads and putting them in with about half the rice and a good many of the slabs in the  | other bag , which I kind of half buried in the dirt of the bank . Then , from the top of the ridge I went over the whole landscape , concentrating on whatever might tell me how to find water . My mind went back to the water wheel and the old woman , and I saw myself dipping out double handfuls from the buckets as they went up past me , diving into bucket after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me was dusty , though . The only possibly good sign I could make out was that the hills to the west looked like they might have some trees , because there were darker patches that I did n't believe could be made by anything else . I decided to cross and try that side of things , hoping for what might be in the next valley over . It took me most of the morning to get across the valley . It was n't all that far , but my heaviness was dogging me bad , and even though I just had the two bags now ? fish and rice , feathers ? it was still hard going . Some people ? women ? passed me on the road , and I trudged along behind them like I was going the same way , but when they went around a turn I started up the bank . I had been right , for there were trees , small ones like scrub oak , and because the slope was steeper than the one I had just come from , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks and lower limbs , and when I got to the top I was really sucking wind , really tired ? " joe 'd , " my father would have called it . I blew a minute and then started down , because there was a big flat at the bottom and no road that I could see . I worked along the lower slope , where there were more trees than had been on the other side . Underneath , the land kept falling away until , as far off to the north as I could see , something flashed through the dry leaves of the trees . In an hour or so I came out over a big flat lake . 1 say flat beca use I 've never seen a lake that  | was n't flat , but I mean something else . As I got closer to it , it seemed to me that the lake must be very shallow all the way across , and when I scanned out through the trees , and made out a man standing two or three hundred yards from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I knew I had been right . I stepped out where he could see me , but he did n't even glance my way . He was fooling with some sticks or stakes that were rickety and kind of pulling on one another , which probably meant that there was a net run between them . I knelt down and drank as much as I wanted , then moved on , because what I was looking for was not the lake itself but what fed into it . If there were fish around I aimed to have some , and I like fish that live in water that 's moving . I 've fished in lakes a lot of times , and through the ice a few , but what I really like is a good stream . Water over rocks has got a private understanding with me , and if a creek has one fish in it , we 'll get together , no matter how long it takes . I spent the rest of the day going up the lake , taking all the time in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted . Woods on both sides closed down on a creek , and I got out into it and moved up it , not on the banks but on the rocks . My cold had not come on me , and the rocks in that running water took all the heaviness off . If there were fish in the lake , there would be some in the creek , but they would be more alive , and would taste better . The best thing in the GI survival kit was the packet of fishhooks , I remembered with a lift of blood in the stomach , and went on up the creek sure enough , hut in the good sense ? there is one ? jumping from one rock to the other , my soft bags banging at me , not worried at all , where I was , about breaking bones or spraining an ankle ; it would n't happen . I felt so good , to tell the truth , that I did n't see  | how anything could stop me , but the one thing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . A waterfall about fifteen feet high was there in front of me , and I stood on my last big rock and looked at it with the low sun striking gold across that pure white : whiter than cloud , whiter than egg white , whiter than snow , whiter than an eyeball , whiter than anything . There was a dry thicket downstream a few yards from the falls , and I set up a kind of camp there . I could really take my time , and I wondered if I might not want to stay maybe a couple of days and rest up , make things comfortable , eat and drink as much as I wanted and really get myself recharged . I could fish at night as well as in the daytime , and I could make a fire here , and cook . I did n't see any reason in the world why anybody else would come here . I could n't see any signs that the place had ever been visited , and I was sure I could stay as long as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , and broke out the survival kit , with the packet of fishhooks and the nylon twine that went with them . I wanted to work by the last of daylight so as not to use up any more of my flashlight , and even though I was going to make a fire later , I did n't want to tend a fire and fish at the same time ; some things ought to have all of your attention . Besides , I wanted to fool with my rig , make it right , and see myself doing it . I cut off a short piece of the string and tied it onto the main line , then found a rock and made a sinker out of it . I cut off some more twine , rigged two hooks , and baited them with pieces of the dried slabs . I sat back in the thicket and cast out , just this side of the falls and almost under them . The light was down now . The gold had been pulled off the falls , and the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best sound on earth , and with that , and with pulling the line until the most sensitive and alert area  | that existed anywhere , in anything alive or dead , was in the forefinger of my right hand , where the string went across it ? I could have felt it if a fly had lit on the line ? everything locked into the good . For a while nothing happened . The line going out of the thicket seemed to shorten ; it was just that I could n't see as far along it as before . But that was not important . I might just as well have been blind , because what mattered was somewhere in the water , and my finger would be the only way to know it . A difference , then : not a strike , not anything you could call a strike , but more like a change . Not much change , but there . I pulled some and felt it happen just a little stronger , then turn into a real fluttering tug , and I pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I brought it in , and risked my flashlight for a second to look . It sure was n't a trout , which for some reason I had expected it might be . I had never heard of any fish in Japan except the carp , which they told us was supposed to be magic in some way ? the Emperor 's ponds , so they said , were full of them ? and this might have been one . It had a fair amount of meat on it , and not a whole lot of fight , and I laid it down on some leaves and baited up again . The same thing happened twice , and I quit , because I did n't think I could eat any more . I raked up some twigs and leaves , and made a circle with some rocks to keep the fire closed in on itself , and then took out the flints . Ever since I was a little boy I had used them , and it had been a long time since I could n't raise a spark on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't get a leaf to burn with the first one . But on the third or fourth try a leaf caught . I lit another one from it , then another from that , cross-stood some twigs over them , and when they caught , some more over those , and in  | a while I had a very nice fire there , with the rocks wheeling around it . I pulled in as many twigs as I could from where I was sitting , slit the fish open , gutted and filleted them with my issue knife . To do things right I needed to boil the rice , and thought I might use the lid of my survival kit ; it was not supposed to break . I made a kind of grill of branches , scooped up some water , and put the rice on and let it stay long enough to absorb the water . Then I stuffed the fish , sharpened some twigs , ran them through the sides to hold things together , and did what I could to cook , keeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It worked out pretty well , if I do say so . It may be that I was hungrier than I thought , and the smoke smell got my glands going , but I never tasted anything better , and was so anxious to get the next fish going that I spilled a whole handful of rice into the fire while I was doing it . With the last one I thought I would try something else , so I cooked some more rice but left the fish raw , and ate that way . I must say it was better cooked than not , but it was not bad the other way , either . When I finished and raked up leaves to make a bed before I put out the fire , I felt so comfortable and secure , with the waterfall standing like it was watching over me , looking out for me , that I made the decision I had been putting off . I would stay one more day , and two if I felt like it . I would get cleaned up in the creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any soap . When I went out of there I wanted to feel like I could take on anything . Two days it was , strange and good . I did n't see another living thing except the fish , which were easy to catch and tasted better  | and better . During the days , I went out and ran on the rocks , almost down to the lake and then back , breathing deep and sometimes almost singing , but I could n't tell you the tune . If anybody was to try to think of having fun in a place and a situation like I was in , with not a whole lot of a chance to stay alive , he would have a hard time believing it . There was no friend anywhere , only thousands of people who wanted to cut off my head , castrate me , do anything they could to me . But fun it was , anyway , those two days and three nights . Before I left I knew every rock , from the waterfall to the lake , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying for some kind of personal record , running with the current and then against it , with the banks , and racing downstream with special leaves I set going . The leaves were dry , and there were some big ones , and I picked them by how much they curled up on themselves and rode high in the water , going through the rapids better than anybody 'd have believed . These things happen , you know ; all you have to do is watch . When I won the last race , just by a hair , I turned back and went all-out for the waterfall , racing the bank shadows , the branches and spikes alongside . In between races I swam and shaved . The water was cold enough to turn your skin a bright blue , but it was worth it , and when it got dark enough so that there would n't be any chance of my smoke being seen , I heated some water and shaved by feel as the dark came on , whetting the blade of my GI knife every now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could . Clean and dry , I lay down on the leaves by the fire and watched the thicket grow almost solid over me . Almost , but not quite , because between the spikes I could see stars , some in the places I would n't have expected , and some where I would , as though they were made to be there . I was too happy and lazy by then ,  | and full of fish and rice , to look for Polaris , but I knew where it was . I wished I had had sense enough to find out more about the stars , the names of them and where they were at the different seasons , when I had the chance . The navigator of my ship , Lieutenant Stennis , was a real shark at all that , and he would have shown me about the stars , the constellations , and anything else I wanted to know if I had just taken the trouble to ask him . It would have been fun to pick out different stars through the twigs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names , to feel the difference that knowing a name makes . But I was left with what I had : being able to find Polaris and pick out two or three of the biggest constellations , like the Dipper and like Orion , which is the prettiest thing up there . It did n't take much of this to put me to sleep , and I have never slept better in my life , as safe under those spikes and crooked branches and twigs and stems as if I were lying inside a rock , one that let in air , and through which you could see stars whenever you opened your eyes . I was not happy when I left , though in a way I was , because I knew the feeling could n't last , and that I could n't make it last just by staying there , even in a place I felt so right about . It had done its job . When I climbed up past the waterfall , clean , with my legs feeling about twice as strong and sure as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed . I was moving with plenty of new power , as though I had eaten something magical , or swum in water that had radium in it , or had a transfusion of something that was better than blood . No blade could pene-  | trate me . A bullet fired right at me would have curved and gone around . I worked back east , a little east of north now , because by my silk map it looked as though I would have to do this to come out on the north coast where the strait between Honshu and Hokkaido was the narrowest . It would take me some time to find the right place . If I was lucky I could do it , because I would be able to see the other island from this one . When I came out of the woods there were long fields with terraces on the other side of them going up the hills , and the sun was warmer than it had been for the last few days . There was some traffic on the road , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty well , moving close to the trees in case I needed to get back amongst them for any reason . A few people were in the fields , but nobody bothered me . As I noticed before , the Japanese spend most of their time looking at the ground , and they do n't even seem to like to look at each other . The heads stayed down , every one , or at least until I was gone . The woods gave out , the hills flattened some , and there was a lot of open space now , which bothered me . I sat in the last bushes and looked out over the terraces in front of me . People were working in the lower ones , though only a few . I had had to deal with the terraces once or twice before , but I 'd climbed up at night , and I felt that if I kept on operating that way I could not make the distance I wanted . This seemed like it might be a good time to try to work out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed to . I had come far enough east , I believed though I was just guessing ? and could work back to the west , at least a little . I seemed to have better luck that way , better conditions , better  | going . I did n't have any particular plan for getting through the terraces except to pretend to be working like the others were doing , and just maneuver to the edge of the next terrace and scramble up onto it when nobody was looking . I did n't think my bags would bother any of them , because they all had stuff around them , wherever they were . Just before I left the trees I had a notion that stopped me for a minute and gave me something to look for ; it was always better if I had that . All these terraces , all this land , this work in the fields ? who got the benefit ? I did n't know anything about the government of Japan , and did n't care , but I had the idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belonged to families , to people who had inherited it or maybe bought it , which meant there would be rich people somewhere around . Rich people , and the houses they lived in . I might have passed some of these but not paid any attention to them ? or enough , anyway . This would be different . I made it across the first terrace by keeping as much distance as I could from any people , and climbed up onto the next level , where there were only a few workers a couple of hundred yards away , bent over like always . On the third terrace a man stood up , put one hand on his back and the other over his eyes , and hollered something at me . I bent down and wondered what I would do if he came to me . He did n't , and edging over a little slower than I had before , I got to the bank and went up . It took me all afternoon to work into the top field . I came to a path there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody could see me , I went along it until it dropped and led through a clump of those same little trees that grew around the waterfall . They were spaced different , though ; I did n't have the feeling I was in a real woods or among trees that grew like they would have if  | they were wild . I probably knew more about Japan already than I thought I did . I had noticed , for one thing , that the Japanese like to arrange whatever they can get their hands on , to have as much neatness as they can ; arrangement is big with them . I had never been in a forest of arranged trees , but it was easy to walk there , and not bad . After about half a mile I came on the house . It was bigger than most of the houses I had seen in Japan , and to the side it had one of those weird arches of wood that look like they might be big doors or gates , except there 's never anything behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way is to wait , as long as I have to . I got fairly close to the house and set up behind a tree that lined up with another one between me and the house . Arranged trees are good cover , I could see that . As it was just beginning to get dark , about quitting time for everybody and everything except the predators , a bunch of men came along the same way I had and went to the house . A door opened ? slid open ? and another man stood there , not coming down , and talked to them . There did n't seem to be any excitement in the talk , and nobody moved his arms around . The Japanese are very excitable , and if the slightest thing bothers them , whatever is not exactly what they 're used to , they talk fast and loud and throw their arms . There was not any of that , though , and I took it to mean that none of them had thought there was anything strange about my being in the terraces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't recognize any of them , but they must have been some of his workers ; there was nobody else for them to be . Finally they left , and the night kept coming . About the time the first stars started to show , a dim light changed the house . On my side was a window , a big one , and there must have been a blind over it , because the light was not  | only dim but had a haze to it like it was shining through cloth , the kind bandages are made out of , or maybe slats real close together . I moved up . I saw things like this as being no different from a stalk , and used everything that was there , going from shadow to shadow , and from my toe to my heel on every step . Nobody in the house could have heard me , even if he had been listening . Looking , maybe ; listening , no . I stepped up on the one wooden board that took my eyes to the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At first I could n't make out anything , but when I got used to it , I could see a couple of shadows , and they were sitting down . I moved side to side , and up and down , until I found a chink that gave them to me . There was an old man and a woman not quite as old . The man sat near a corner , and the woman was putting things on the floor , probably getting ready to eat . She moved very slow , and after a few minutes got up and went into another room . To do this she had to slide a part of the wall , or panel , and she did n't make any more sound than I had . Everything was so quiet ; it was more quiet than anything in the woods . She came back with some bowls and dishes , and the man , without any hurry , came and sat cross-legged where the food was , and near something that looked like they probably cooked on it . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole lot . There were three sets of panels , and before I went in , I thought it would be good if I knew what was in the other rooms , if 1 could find a way to look in . I moved to my left and around the corner , but there were no windows on that side . I went around . In what I took to be the back , there was a window but no light . There was a door , too , and I pulled on it just enough to see that it would slide . The other side of the house did n't have a window  | either , so I came back to the door , pushed it open just enough , left it that way , and went in . I could have waited until they went to sleep , but there might not be any light then , and I would be at a disadvantage I did n't want . I was at one , anyway . I thought I had better not try to make out just by feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit something , trip , make a noise . I risked one step , feeling with my foot , then another , which should have put me in the middle of the room . I needed to find the other door , and there was nothing to do but use the flashlight for a second , let the setup brand on my brain , move a couple of steps , cut the light , and take hold of the panel . I should come out behind the man . I figured to take them fast . I got set for the light , and hit the switch . The door , with a big red dragon design on it , fire out of his mouth and all , was right in front of me , and out of the side of my eyes I could tell that this was a room used mainly for clothes and stuff that hung up . ' Mere was a bed almost flat to the floor that I had just missed in the dark . I could have busted my ass , might even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sure . I pulled out my long blade , made for American kitchens , and put my hand on the door . I knew which way it slid . I moved the panel . It did n't make any sound , but he heard it . 1 le was on his feet in a crouch before I could even take a step , and was halfway to the wall before I tried to cut him off . I could n't get the shot with my knife I wanted , but I tried anyway and missed , and drove through the panel , which was paper , or something like it . By the time I pulled back , he had a sword that he held with both hands , like a baseball bat . He came at me flat-footed , and then with a loud low scream like an explosion swung the blade . I backed off and held up my knife , and it was  | gone like a bell had rung and made it disappear ; that was his blade on mine . I heard my knife hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time since I had been in the room I made a good move . I faked and went around him , as fast as he was . I jumped faster than he could turn , and was down the panel and through it , closing it before he could get to me . It was dark in there ? not completely dark , but almost . Now , I thought , now . And then : No , not now . I pulled my issue knife , my short one . The panels were closed at both ends , and even if I could n't hear them move , I would know it as soon as one of them changed . I had my hand on the one I had just closed , my fingers as sensitive as they were on the string when I 'd fished by the waterfall . If he moved the panel at my end I would hit him through the paper before he knew it . If he tried to put the sword through the paper , hoping to hit me blindside , he would miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be all over him , too , if he did it . I had my eyes on the panel at the far end , and if it showed any new light I would ease my own panel , look out , and locate him . Nothing happened . He knew I was there , somewhere along the panel , and he knew that I would try to kill him if I could , and probably his wife as well . I felt building up the need to take a risk , maybe just a small one , to find out more than I knew , standing there in the dark with half my nerves in my hands and the other half in my eyes . That could n't last for long , and I knew it . I believed he would not think I had stayed at the same place where he saw me disappear . I slid the panel a crack , did n't move my feet , and looked out . There was no one in the room . Now what ? My first thought was that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . He might have gone out the back , the way I had come in , and taken his wife with him . But I was willing to gamble that he had n't . One of the other things I had noticed about the Japanese , besides how excitable they were , was their pride , especially the men ; the women did n't have much say . And this old man with the sword was a soldier ? a samurai , or whatever the name is ? and would have that pride . He would defend his house . He would not let some stranger run him out . And as I kept looking into the empty room , more came to me . If the guy was a warrior , from the warrior class , like they say , he would not only fight , but he would want to fight . He was the quickest man I ever saw in my life . He had probably been using that sword , in one way or another , for fifty years , and this would be his last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was quick . I did n't say fast . Fast means running ; I did n't know whether he was fast that way , but it did n't matter . I did n't plan to run . The only other possibility was that he was still in the house , behind one of the other three panels , and if that was so , he had me in the same position that I 'd had him in . He was invisible ; I had to go look for him . I had to move the other panels , and he would be in there in the dark , and he would be able to see my silhouette as soon as I let the light in . And that was not all : he could move from one paneled-off room to another . We could keep this up all night , until somebody made a mistake , or guessed wrong . And I was at one other disadvantage , too . I was up against somebody who could hear better than I could . I hated to admit it , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million years . Disadvantage ; advantage , maybe . Most of the movies I had seen in my life were cowboy movies . I had n't seen many , but in  | at least three or four of them was a scene where two guys are shooting at each other from behind rocks , and the hero pitches a rock over behind some other rocks , the other guy raises up and fires in that direction , shows himself , and the good guy mows him down . Why not ? I thought in the dead quiet . Why not something like that ? I felt around and pulled some silk stuff off the wall ? a gown or a dress of some kind ? and balled it up very slowly , using one hand against my side . This would have to be a soft sound , not a rock making a big clatter , bouncing off other dry rocks , but soft , real soft . I leaned out a little and pitched the silk so that it would fall close to the middle of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched . This was my bait . Up in the cabin I used to read a lot . My father was a good hunter pretty good , anyway , but not as good as he wanted to be . He had a lot of books up there in the cabin with the one red wall , with the snowshoes and rifles , and the mice pulling the milk bottles . More than half the books were about hunting : hunting in Africa , and India , and places all over the world . There was even one story about men hunting each other , like big game . The thing that struck me the most of anything I read was about a man who hunted alligators in the Everglades swamp in Florida with an Indian who took him around and showed him where the big alligators were . The hunter was going for the biggest trophy in the swamp with a bow and arrow , and the Indian had to get the alligator to come in for a close shot . What stuck with me was that the Indian touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , just barely touched it , and the alligator came , and the guy shot him with his bow . This was something like that : my touch on the surface of the silence was the roll of silk out in the middle of the floor , and I  | watched the other panels , one after the other , and then back . Believe me , I watched . And finally one moved , just a hair . It was not the one I would have expected , the one opposite me , but the panel I had first come through , in the room that went to the outside , where I had left my shoes . Things had narrowed down , but I was still up against his ear . No matter how quiet I was , he could hear me . The logical thing would be to move down to the end of my room , which was like a long dark hall , open up real sudden , and jump him through the other panel as hard as I could and as fast as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? he would then be able to make a move of his own , would hit me with that fantastic speed , or would be gone . Or I could move out into the center of the room and dare him to come at me , but right away I knew I would n't do that . He had too much quick , too much training for me ; the life I had behind me would not stack up to his , at least in hand-to-hand . I could step out , let him see me , cross the room , and go in behind the other panel . That way , he would have three choices . He could change panels and come into the dark hall where I would be , and we could have it out there . I would be able to see him come in , and he would not have all that much of an advantage in the dark . I liked this . I wanted to pull him in , like the guy did the alligator . The sound of silk had done part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be that the dark would do the rest . I believed he would come in there with me . I had the image of him staying outside , in the main room , and stabbing back and forth through the panel , and I knew that would n't work , and he would know it . And he would know , also , that I 'd learned enough not to stand up against him in the open . It was my  | notion that his pride would bring him into the room behind the panel on the other side . I felt this so strongly that I did n't believe there could be any other way to go . I stepped out and went over . It was like crossing water so deep there was no bottom to it . The depth was the danger in itself . There is that pull , you cross on top , and you know what you 've been over . I got to the other side , opened the panel and closed it , knowing that he had seen me and would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like on the side I 'd left , where I was sure I could n't stay very long . Here , on this side of the depth , I was not worried about that . I would stay as long as it took . Not long , not too long . The far panel opened , the light came in and stayed on the wall of clothes , on the bed between . The old man flat-footed forward , his sword at something like port arms , except that both hands were on the handle , the blade across his body , hip to shoulder . But this time was new , he was new : his head was forward , peering , in a way it had n't been in the main room . I could maybe risk some sound , and I hit my bare heel on the floor . He took another step and swung , but he was at least ten feet from me . He swung again , backhanded , and then went into his crouch ? his defensive position , must have been . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right away . Sound was his , but mine too , if I could use it . Sight was mine , and in the almost-dark there was no way he could use it . I hit the floor again , the mat . He began to fight , but he was fighting a ghost , or maybe more than one of them . He still had that marvelous quick ? I had never seen anything better ? but it all went into the dark , and into his form . The moves of that long blade in the dim light were like a weave of steel , a net of metal and light . He thrust out , he pulled hack , he swung the sword like a ball bat , he came forward , he backed up , and all  | the time his balance was perfect . I did n't breathe and , almost caught in that net , for a second I thought I had everything . I thought I did . But I could n't wait , and I did n't . I would not ever forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But still quick , too quick . I led him with sound , he came in , he came onto my knife . I held it for him , just so . Even though his jugular must have been cut , judging from the fire-out of blood , he stayed on his feet , still making his moves , holding his form , holding on to his ancestors , who must have been soldiers , sure enough . Then , with the blood coming weaker , he went down , rolled , and I hit him through the back of the neck , cut the cord , and finished him . He was still from then on out , but for me he would always be the one who made that weave of steel . Any lick would have cut through both forelegs of a bull elk , and I would always be just outside , but watching ; that was the best . " You 're a good one , " I said . " You sure are . I can use you . " I went back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it always was , except the relation was not quite the same . I needed to find the woman , and started through the rooms . She was down behind some clothes , near the door where I had come into the house , not too far from my shoes , and I ran her through twice without her making a sound , then laid the body out and put silk over it . I felt that maybe some of the good had come back into my blade , but I knew also that it would take inure than that to get back what had gone out of it when it got knocked loose from me . I dragged the old man 's body out of the long hall and stretched it out near the table where he and his woman had  | been eating . I was thinking bone , long bone ; I was thinking needles . If I got up as far north as I meant to , I would have to be better than any Eskimo ; whatever I could pick up in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with myself for the time back on that yellow slope , with myself and the pelvis . This would be different , I was hoping . I peeled back the guy 's sleeve , and with my small knife I cut open the inside of his forearm , running the tip of the blade down the bone from his elbow to his wrist . Then I pulled a low stout bench from the wall it had been next to , laid the arm on it and brought down the handle of the old guy 's sword as hard as I could , three or four times . The bone cracked well enough , and I pried loose three long splinters and broke them off . The fire in the little cookstove on the table was still going , with some meat in the pot , and I ate it while the bone splinters dried . It was good meat . I did n't think there would be much of it in Japan , the way the war was going for them , but this guy was rich , and I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I finished , I took up the splinters and looked them over . They were dry now , and the points on them were sharp , as sharp as any needle you could want . I did n't want to work with them that night , but I did need to know if I could make eyes in them , so I took one of my fishhooks to see if I could penetrate the bone , and it turned out OK . I guess I could have straightened out the hooks themselves , and sewed with them , but I wanted them like they were . They had the waterfall in them , which was maybe the best place I had ever been in my life . I was real tired , but maybe a little more excited than I should have been , so I walked around the room real slow , seeing what was there . It bothered me that there were no pictures or decorations , but I was not quite right about that , because oft from  | the light , in a corner , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funny , the flower did n't seem to be there in any way an ordinary person would put it . It 's hard to explain , but it was like it was there as part of an arrangement from which the other flowers had been taken away . It reminded me of the jackstraws my father and I used to play with up in the cabin . You let a whole bunch of sticks fall any way they want to , and so far as you know , they should 've come out that way ? even that they wanted to , and knew about it before they fell , and even made it happen like it did . This flower had that about it : one jackstraw , right there , and right . Up above the flower was a picture ? I could barely make it out ? of a young guy in a military uniform , probably the old man 's son , or grandson , maybe . I went into my first room , got my shoes from outside , and lay down on the pallet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the needles with a lot of pleasure , because I had done something I never had before , and if I was going to live off the country when I got to where I was headed , as I planned to , this would help . I slept pretty well , and it was first light when I woke up . Everything was very quiet , and I spent some time getting myself reorganized . I thought that when the sun came up the men who had talked to the old guy the day before would probably come back , but that they would n't come into the house without being asked . Sure enough , about eight o'clock there was a light knock at the door , and I was sure it was the same people . I sat on the pallet until they went away , and then started going through the house for anything I might be able to use . I did n't believe the others would be back that day , but I did n't think , either , that it would make sense to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave before the sun broke again .  | The old man and I were about the same size , though he was a little heavier . That was good , because the bagginess of his pants made it easy for me to fill the layer between two pairs of them with feathers . I spent all day sewing , with strips of silk I cut out of some of the stuff hanging on the wall , and by the time I finished I had two pairs of pants and two coats , all layered with swan feathers . That would do for a start ; that would do pretty well . I needed some socks , or at least something I could wrap around my feet , and some gloves , and I found some with three fingers , but they would be all right since I did n't have anything else . I started the charcoal fire at the table and ate more meat , and then spent the last part of daylight going everywhere in the house I could , looking for light metals , anything thin and strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamline my bag , make it as light as I could and still have what I needed , and not any bulkier than I could help . I had some feathers left . I could have used them all , but for some reason I did n't want to : I guess I had just got used to having them with me . The clothes I had sewn were hardly heavier than the feathers themselves , and with the other feathers , a couple of long things like skewers I wrapped up in silk , gloves , an extra pair of shoes , and a heavy hat with ear flaps , I had what I wanted in the bag . That , plus the stuff I had taped on me , would be all I needed . I thought for a while that I might take the old man 's sword , because I could use it for hacking brush , say , or chopping light kindling . But in the end I left it , because I could n't see any way I would be able to do any fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man looked when he was coming after me , like the sword was a part of him , and the air in front of him was like a net ? not on fire exactly , but electric , sparking . I put some more silk  | over him , dark silk , and the sword on top of that , without the scabbard . I stowed the bag next to the back door by the woman 's body and lay down again , and might even have laughed a little at the idea that I would be leaving before the break of light , the only American gunner in Japan who was sighting on Polaris and carrying two feather-layered coats and two pairs of pants , shoes , a flap hat , what was left of a bag of swan feathers , and two pairs of three-fingered gloves . I woke up slow , and there was nothing around me . Then , in my mind , and more or less in the dark in front of me , too , there was that net of light again , the swarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old blind fighter . This was a new place to start from , and a new way . Suddenly I could think a long distance ahead of me . I saw mountains , lakes , roads , and rivers , and on all of them it began to snow . The landscape moved upward , and was a kind of combination of what I had seen in Japan and what I remembered from Alaska , which was a lot , everything that mattered . There was a boat in it , because ? and this came in last of all ? I was going to have to cross water to the other island , and I already knew I would have to do it at night ; that was exciting . I rolled over and sat up . I decided to use a little of my flashlight again , to portion out the light like it was water or food , like somebody who was in a lifeboat after a shipwreck , maybe with some other people , would have to do . Before that , I needed to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay there watching the storm of sparks from the sword . I had been in Japan for a week or so , and I tried to estimate how far from Tokyo I had come . On foot , not very far :  | fifty miles , maybe . My main distance had been made on the log train , and I did n't have any real way to tell how many miles I had covered . I had spent a lot of the time making pictures in my mind and projecting them out on the landscape ? the deer heads moving toward infinity , or somewhere ? but even if I had n't done that , I still could n't have come up with much of an estimate . The train had been slow but steady , and I may have made a hundred miles , or even more . That sure was the best I could do in the dark . The map and the light would have to come now . Light , a little of it , a very little , a short ration . I spread the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silk , everything silk ; I had even brought some of it myself . If I had estimated correctly , or even guessed anywhere near right , I had made two hundred miles , or maybe even as much as two hundred and twenty , and needed to go about that much more . The notion that I had come halfway from Tokyo to the northern tip of Honshu was encouraging , even though I knew that the guess was off , had to be off , and maybe by a long way . Still .. . I looked for lakes , and there were a lot of them . They all had rivers running into them ; I could n't be sure that any of them had a waterfall just up from it . One was near where my estimate had brought me out , and if that was so , I had another checkpoint , though that could have been far out , too ; far off my reality . If I was where I guessed , I was not far south of a range of mountains , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass between it and a town called Morioka . If I made it through there , held course for about thirty miles , I could then take up a true-north heading and work my way onto a peninsula that would bring me as close to Hokkaido as I could get . " When would come the boat and the night water . That was a new thrill every time I thought about it . I remembered the deep , pure  | interior blue of the iceberg , with Tornarssuk and I stopped beyond words , both paddles out of the water . What a thing that was : the only color in the world , a new color , with life in it , the life of the heart of ice , which came clear when everything between it and us tore off , slid , and fell . There did n't seem to be much population on the peninsula , though there was bound to be some , because Japan depends a lot on fishing ? so said the Colonel ? and right along the coast there had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be for later . I saved my forward thinking about Hokkaido for later , too ; that was special in another way . I left off all that , switched out the light , stowed it , and got up , the last thing in my head the idea that I could scout out my position on the peninsula by knowing ? or believing , anyway ? that I would be able to see Hokkaido from the shortest distance to it over the strait . I surely should be able to see it , since it did n't look to be more than twenty miles , or maybe not even that . I got my gear together , put on my shoes , and went out . I did n't even take a last glance at anything in the house . There was not anything to see that I had n't already seen , and the old man and woman would lie there until somebody found them . I planned to be a long way from there when that hap-pened . I struck off to the northeast through woods and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the idea that I had two coldweather outfits in my bag gave me confidence , especially together with the fact that they had been sewn with bone needles , that they had that kind of life . I was looking forward to getting into one of them . That would have to be at a special time , and at a place that had something for me . The hills were pretty steep , and though I did n't run into  | anybody , or have to make a lot of detours to keep away from people , I did n't make very good time , and got tired faster than I would have liked , with all the climbing . The hills were like foothills , and I thought that there was probably a higher range to the west , which I wanted to stay away from ; it was not time for the mountains yet . In the afternoon there were some snow flurries , and I reckoned that I might have to get into one of my new outfits sooner than I 'd thought . Still , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired , I found that I kept pulling off my course . My feet , without my knowing until I realized it , had been trying to search out level ground , to make things easier . I crossed an east-west road , went through some trees and bushes , and then found myself moving up on a situation different , a lot different , from anything else I had ever been close to , or even thought about . There was a light ground fog over a big field that I could n't see the ends of , to left and right . I had n't noticed any fog , or that the air was moist , but as soon as the field developed in front of me ? or half developed is more like it ? the fog was there as though the field had made it . More than that , had made it for what was happening there . Some people were moving around , and I watched them , and it was n't long before I was studying as much as watching , they were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything but blur the outlines of things , and it was not hard to see that the people ? all men , I thought ? were dressed the same , in long white dresses or robes , their eyes all on the ground . They seemed to be looking for something , and a few of them had baskets . They were just there in the field , in that fog , blurred , but they could not disappear . Very slowly they crossed back and forth , and every now and  | then one of them would pick something up and put it in a basket . Nobody had ever had a dream so quiet as this one which had movement in it . I remember going to sleep one summer in the Classen River valley and opening my eyes and finding a whole herd of deer , with two big bucks in it , standing not fifteen yards away , looking at me . I closed my eyes and opened them again almost right away , and they were gone . I had not heard a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were ever really there or not . That was the quietest movement up until now . Nobody said anything , nobody did anything except sleepwalk back and forth , crisscrossing without touching , not speaking , like they were all going to do this forever , through all the seasons , through rain and snow and sun , whatever there would be . There must have been seventy-five of them at least , and with a .5o caliber ? or even a hand-held .30 ? I could have laid them all down in just a couple of three-second bursts . I do n't think any of them would even have looked up , but just gone on crisscrossing until there was nobody left to cross . Believe me , they were not like soldiers , and I had no fear of anything to do with them . While I was standing there the fog thickened a little , and I took a couple of steps clear of the woods , and came out where they could see me , if any of them wanted to . Just as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men , out in the middle of the group , straightened and came toward me , not with any special hurry , but different by his - notions , working through the others toward me . I let him come , not wishing for machine guns ; no need . For some reason I was thinking about the feet of the men in the field , and the way they were taking their bodies around back and forth , between , and among each other , but never with any contact . Japan must have done something to me without my . u  | knowing it , because things came into my head that had never been there before . The feet of the spider are the quietest ; they must be . The quietest and the farthest off , no matter how close they are . It was those kind of feet that were coming , from the others that were like them . He came up to me and stopped , straightening more , with an effort . He was not Japanese , and had on gold-rimmed glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said in English . I was not surprised . " Ask me what ? " " What are you doing here ? " I smiled , I really did , because I was not going to ask him the same question . I did n't want to know , particularly . If we got to talking , I was sure he would tell me anyway . " You knew I was not a Nip ? " He seemed a little puzzled , probably because he did n't understand how people in the service put things . " Not Japanese . " " Yes , I knew it , " he said . " You mean , you know it now , when you can get a close look . " " No , I knew it when you came out of the woods and stood there . No Japanese would do that . You were too straight . You looked like you owned the place . " He looked off and back . There was more fog than there had been , and the others in the field were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much gone . I glanced past him at the heads in the field crossing each other . He lifted a thumb toward them without turning around . " Do n't worry about them . They do n't even know you 're here . They are off in a state of mind . It does n't have anything to do with this field , or with you . Or with me either , for that matter . "  | I picked up my bag . " I 'd better move . Can I go straight on through ? " He turned , this time toward the heads going back and forth and in and out , then he smiled carefully , like one of the company clerk-typists back in the squadron . " Well , maybe not straight through , but if you want to , you can make it on over to the other side . They wo n't bother you . " I stepped past him , and for a second did n't know what had happened to my arm , because I believed I was already on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just by the sleeve , either . " Do n't go , " he said in a different voice . " Do n't go yet . " He looked at me , peering , kind of . " Stay with us . We 'll take care of you . You need to hide , do n't you ? " " I been hiding . " I shook loose . " It would take me a while to tell you all the places . But the Nips ai n't laid a hand on me up to now , and as far as I can tell they do n't know where I am . " I jounced the bag up and down to settle what was in there . " But some of them know where I 've been . Some would , by now . I better move on . " He had me again , and for some reason I waited this time before I shook him off . There seemed to be something really important to him , and there might be some advantage in it later on , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You can rest up here , " he said , building up his eagerness . " Where have you been sleeping ? " " One place and another . Outside . A couple of nights under some logs . That 's the closest I 've been to sleeping under a roof , except a couple of nights at some guy 's house . It was maybe too quiet in there . " " We 've got plenty to eat , all you want . We 've got some fish
