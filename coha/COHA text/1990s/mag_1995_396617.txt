For 32-year-old Scott Amedure , flying to Chicago two weeks ago to share his romantic fantasies with chat show host Jenny Jones was a thrill . Adventurous , outgoing and addicted to talk shows , the unemployed gay bartender from Orion Township , Mich. , could n't get enough of sensational daytime TV . " He really liked shows that revealed the intimate details of people 's lives , " remembered Gayle Clinton , 50 , a McDonald 's manager who was Amedure 's neighbor in the Chateau Orion mobile-home park . Jon Schmitz , too , was excited about the March 6 taping . A gregarious waiter at the Fox and Hounds restaurant in the tony Detroit suburb of Bloomfield Hills , Schmitz , 24 , had been told by producers that he had a secret admirer who would step forward on the syndicated Jenny Jones Show . Although he had balked the first time a Jones staffer had called , coworkers persuaded Schmitz to take a chance : Last fall he had split with his fiancee ( a woman whose name has been withheld by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new relationship . Before leaving for Chicago , he spent $300 on new clothes in hopes of impressing his admirer . Their meeting was to be fateful , but not in the way either had hoped . By the time it was all over , Schmitz 's life would be shattered , and Amedure 's lost . Talk show hosts such as Jones would find themselves on trial , and media critics would take aim against producers who use shock tactics to create explosive encounters  --  and reduce human relationships to tabloid cliches . Schmitz 's dream began to deflate the moment he was ushered in front of a tittering audience that obviously knew something he did n't . Onstage in the studio in Chicago 's NBC Tower was Donna Riley , 32 , Schmitz 's upstairs neighbor at the Manitou Lane Apartments in Oxford Township . Assuming Donna was the one who was smitten with him , Schmitz gave her a hug . Then , as the audience guffawed , Jones told Schmitz that the boyish-looking Amedure , who was seated next to Riley  --  and whom Schmitz barely knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be flattered , " Jones said . Although Schmitz would later tell police that he had felt " almost sick to his stomach , " he reacted calmly . He said , " Yes , but I 'm a heterosexual . I 'm not interested . " The audience roared and applauded . Three days later , on the morning of March 9 , Amedure lay dead in his kitchen , killed by two shotgun blasts to the chest . Fifteen minutes after the shots were fired , Schmitz dialed 911 and confessed . He told police that he felt " humiliated " by his Jenny Jones experience ; as he explained it to the 911 operator , " He Amedure f  --  me on national TV . " In the wake of the tragedy , observers were quick to blame The Jenny Jones Show . Calling the secret-admirer stunt an ambush , Oakland County , Mich. , prosecutor Richard Thompson maintains the program 's staff " displayed in credible insensitivity and irresponsibility . " Says Thompson : " They seem to follow the rule that anything goes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is left dead , and another faces life in prison without parole . " Jones broke her silence to tell PEOPLE on March 15 , " Getting the news was so shocking  --  I was devastated . " But , she says , the tragedy " had nothing to do with the show . We have no responsibility whatsoever because Schmitz was not misled . All the guests knew that it could be a man or a woman  --  it 's very clear from phone logs and producer 's notes that he did know . This was not an ambush show . " Insisting that her producers had made the show 's premise clear before Schmitz was booked , after he arrived in Chicago and before the taping itself , Jones says Schmitz had been asked how he would react if his admirer were a man . " This was all up front , and we have documentation , " she says . Jones ( whose show is owned by Telepictures Productions , a division of Time Warner , which owns PEOPLE 'S publisher , Time Inc. ) admits that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going about our business with this horrible thing hanging over our head . I feel very badly for the victim 's family and for Jon 's family . " Amedure 's relatives are understandably furious . Four days after the murder , his mother , Patricia Graves , said , " I 'm very angry , and nobody from the show has called to express their sorrow . " According to her lawyer , Sidney Frank , a civil suit " is definitely an option . " Media critics , too , are disturbed . In the past week writers , including The Washington Post 's influential Tom Shales , have wondered whether the ratings scramble has spawned a ruthless frenzy among producers of shows like Jones 's , and whether down-and-dirty " ambush " segments have any place on TV . ( See sidebar , page 45 . ) To others , though , pinning the blame on talk shows means missing the point . Jeffrey Montgomery , president of the Triangle Foundation , a Detroit-based gay-activist group , criticizes prosecutor Thompson and others who seem to suggest " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another man 's attraction is humiliating . My question is , " Why is that humiliating ? ' ' " The best person to answer that question , of course , would be Schmitz himself . An avid outdoorsman and nature lover , he was raised in Michigan as the fourth of five children ; his father , Allyn , is a woodwork refinisher , and his mother , Connie , a homemaker . In high school , " all the girls had crushes on Jon , " says a close friend who asks to remain anonymous . " But he always had one steady girlfriend . " After graduating from Lake Orion High School in 1987 , he settled nearby , took a succession of jobs waiting tables and moved in with the woman who would become his fiancee . Although they eventually broke off their engagement , agreeing that neither was ready for marriage , " they remained close , " says the friend . But several patrons of Pontiac 's gay Club Flamingo , where Amedure worked until last fall , claim that Schmitz 's life was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just remember certain faces , " says one regular . But no one at that bar  --  or other gay bars in the area  --  has provided further corroboration that Schmitz socialized there . Although Schmitz has repeatedly asserted that he is heterosexual , his neighbor Donna Riley decided to set him up with Amedure ( who reportedly never met him at the Flamingo ) . A flirtatious sort with a cadre of loyal friends , Amedure was known for helping neighbors with leaky porches and broken hearts . " He was always the first one there when people were down , " says Carrie Ryan , 24 . " The bottom line is that Scott wanted to be loved by everybody . " Yet Amedure , it seems , had his own troubles . The youngest of six children of Patricia , a factory worker who is now retired , and her then husband , Frank , a retired truck driver , he dropped out of high school and enlisted in the Air Force at 17 . After a four-year hitch , he returned to Michigan and worked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an addiction to cocaine , Amedure twice entered drug rehab programs . Amedure was taken with Schmitz from the moment they met last month outside the Manitou Lane Apartments . As Amedure explained during the Jenny Jones taping , Schmitz was under Riley 's car doing repairs when Amedure " saw him from the waist down . " After Schmitz emerged , Amedure said he thought he was " cute , " according to Vicki Shifferly , an Ohio beauty-parlor owner in the Jones audience . Riley , said Shifferly , told the audience that " nobody knew whether Jon was gay , but she was , trying to get them together . When she had Jon for dinner , she asked Scott to drop by . " It was Riley who accompanied Amedure on the March 5 flight to Chicago for theJenny Jones episode billed as " Secret Crushes on People of the Same Sex . " Schmitz , who arrived on another flight , told police that a show staffer had assured him that his admirer was a woman . " He was so excited when he phoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jumping up and down on his hotel bed . " Although he reacted coolly to Amedure 's revelation the next day , audience members say that Schmitz was clearly embarrassed . Says Shifferly : " He was totally shocked . " Adds Oakland County sheriffs department detective Craig Stout , who questioned Schmitz after the murder : " He said he was upset , but he convinced himself to be a gentleman . " On the flight home with Riley and Amedure that evening Schmitz reportedly confided to a stranger , " I 've had a rather bizarre day . " Describing the Jones episode , he said he was worried about how his family would react . " If I think about it for a while , " The Detroit News quoted him as saying , " I could get mad . " Still , Schmitz volunteered to drive Riley and Amedure home . Before they left Detroit Metropolitan Airport on Monday evening , Amedure , apparently as a prank , snatched a flashing construction light and stashed it in Schmitz 's 1981 Ford station wagon . At about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brewski 's , where , according to waitress Jennifer Marcus , Schmitz was " friendly and considerate , as always . " By Schmitz 's account , all three went on to Riley 's apartment , and he left alone around 2 a.m . Although Amedure 's mother later claimed her son told her he slept with Schmitz that night , so far police have no evidence . Schmitz has said that he did n't see Amedure again until the day of the murder . After spending Wednesday night with a platonic friend , a woman who said later that he was still upset about the Jones show , Schmitz arrived at his apartment at 10 a.m. to find the purloined construction light in front of his door , along with an unsigned , handwritten note that he took as a come-on from Amedure . Perhaps feeling he had been pushed too far , Schmitz apparently snapped . Half an hour after finding the note , he drove to Tom 's Hardware in Oxford , where he bought five rounds of buckshot . At Gary 's Guns , in a strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He was very calm , " reports co-owner Nancy Morgan . " He said he and his dad were going hunting . " Just before 11 a.m. , Schmitz pulled into Bluebird Lane , down the street from the mobile home that Amedure shared with Gary Brady , his roommate . With Brady standing by , Schmitz calmly asked about the note  --  which Amedure denied writing  --  and then said he had to go outside and turn off his engine . When Schmitz returned to the trailer , he was carrying the shotgun . Amedure reportedly grabbed a wicker chair and tried to protect himself , but Schmitz shot his victim in the chest , then fired again as he fell . Arraigned on March 10 , when he pleaded not guilty , Schmitz is being held in isolation and faces another court appearance on April 4 . Still in shock , he " has n't quite grasped the seriousness of this , " according to his lawyer Fred Gibson , who is expected to enlist a psychiatrist to examine his client . For their part , Amedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder , Riley told PEOPLE she was devastated . " I lost my best friend , " she said . Only Amedure 's neighbor Gayle Clinton  --  a self-described " talk show freak "  --  can see a silver lining . " Scott had a troubled life , " she says , " and all I can think now is that he 's got to be happy . He 's probably looking down and saying , " I knew I 'd make it on TV .
