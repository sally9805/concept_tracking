Father La Frambois was anxious to baptize me in the Missouri River , to change my name from Cuwignaka Duta , or Red Dress , to the holier appellation , Esther . He was an energetic old man and vivid in color ; his cheeks so brightly red they looked slapped , and his eyes a dark blue like the night sky , although sometimes dimming to black in moments of anger . I would not be coaxed into the Missouri , not even to repay him for the hours he spent teaching me to read , to write , recite , to form my thoughts into plain , desolate English until I could speak in terms more lovely than the priest . He bribed me with stories of heaven and eternal life , told me it was within my power to transform my soul from a black crusted thing into a white snow goose with silken wings . When that failed , he bribed me with sugar and silver crosses for me to wear dangling from my earlobes . I wore the crosses to test their potency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . And when he was silent , I knew that the silver crosses were really symbols of the morning star , the same image we painted on our buckskin clothes . But I did not tell Father La Frambois , because it is n't polite to point out to an elder person that he is mistaken . <p> The missionary priest traveled alone throughout Dakota Territory , perched on a tall American horse that routinely charged our ponies and had to be led through the village with a blanket covering its head . The priest arrived year after year in the fall , noticed first by Sunka Gleska , Spotted Dog , who would race in circles around my father 's lodge , occasionally pausing to howl . This clever companion was a pumpkin-colored dog with wiry fur and white speckles on his muzzle . He could respond to commands made in either Dakota or English , which greatly impressed ; my father . Once alerted by Spotted Dog , the village would turn out to welcome Father La Frambois , moving towards him like an errant wave from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our winter camp , familiar with the heavy black dress he wore falling awkwardly from his crooked shoulders ; he resembled a turkey vulture with broken wings . He would remain with us until spring , drill me in my lessons and study my careful penmanship . He taught me to write the name Esther so that I would be ready to claim it once I had saved my soul , and although I refused the name , I liked to draw it ; managing the ink so that it would flow gracefully without bleeding , and fashioning the " E " with dramatic flourishes , curved into the shape of a lush bear heavy with winter fat . <p> Perhaps I should have told the Jesuit directly : " I will never be the convert you desire . I am Red Dress , beloved of snakes . " I know he would have found that statement foolish . He had no patience for spirits , dreams of animal totems , despite his self-confessed ability to transform wine into blood and a crisp wafer of bread into living flesh . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and studied Scriptures , translated his teachings into the Dakota language so that my curious father , Bear Soldier , and his seven sub-chiefs could decide for themselves the merit of Father 's words , I never told the priest my own legend . <p> My mother was Black Moon , the lady whose long features threatened to slip off her face until se smiled , beautifully , lifting them back into place . In her care I came to know myself ; and her memories of me became my own . I recalled being set out to play on a vast buffalo hide , then , made drowsy by the sun , tipping over and sliding into sleep . My mother was visiting with , friends a short distance away , her hands busy with quillwork . She did n't notice the two rattlesnakes gliding onto my infant 's shadow , where they coiled together , joining me in a nap . I remember their chalky smell and graceful movements , the feel of their cool glossy skin . As I slept I clutched a serpent by the tail and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never struck , was patient with me even when my mother and her friends hovered , horrified , above his twisting head . <p> " Do n't move , " the women whispered to each other . They pulled my mother back and made her sit on the ground . " Look at how they are claiming her , " one woman said . Eventually my grasping fist released the viper , and he and his companion left the buffalo hide . I think I cried for them to return , but my mother crushed me into her arms , and I grabbed her braids , thinking they were black snakes . <p> " That one charms the snakes , " people have whispered all my life , but they have it wrong . The snakes charmed me . <p> The final winter of my friendship with the priest was 1864 by his reckoning . Father La Frambois was determined to impress , to introduce us to that deity he called the True God . He told me to inform the village crier that he would be saying mass on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he fairly shouted at me . His arm swept the horizon . " Everyone must attend . Everyone must be given this opportunity to hear the word of God and discover the life everlasting . " <p> His skin was slick with the heat of his emotion ; I thought of melting tallow . Pity pricked my heart , and when I opened my mouth to tell the crier what Father had said , scheming words emerged . " Tomorrow Father La Frambois will dance for us on the grass . " It was a minor deception I felt would bring the people rushing , curious , to the level floodplain Father had selected for his impromptu church . Even the older warriors  --  dispassionate , believing they had seen everything worth noticing in the world  --  would surely turn out for such a spectacle . <p> " You will be my voice , " Father said that evening , ignorant of my treason . " You will be the instrument of your people 's salvation . " His bright cheeks were flames ; he looked ready to burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for his pupil , an unwilling acolyte . Why not my younger brother or little sister ? Why not a patient child whose mind was untroubled , so rarely did she question what she heard ? I asked him now , " Father , why am I your voice ? " <p> I received the answer that is no answer : " It is God 's will . " The next afternoon four hundred people assembled on the level plain to witness Father 's dance . He received everyone  --  even the crawling infants  --  with a handshake , and made the people stand in straight rows . " These are pews , " he said . When everyone was settled , he faced the orderly group and began to speak : " Welcome to your grass church . The Lord is all around you-let Him into your heart . You have been a stubborn people , a great challenge to me . I have come this year , and in past years , because I care about you , and your souls are in jeopardy . " <p> Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my tribesmen : " Welcome , friends . The past winters we spent together have been very pleasant . I 've learned a great deal from these visits and I have respect for you . You are a strong people . " <p> The warriors nodded , breathing , " Oha(n) , " and several of the women trilled their tongues to make the wicagalata cry of approval . " They say you are making sense , " I told the priest . He spoke for an hour about the necessity of cleansing our spirits until I began to think of the soul as a garment I could rinse in the river and then spread on a smooth rock to dry in the sun . Mind you , when I translated inaccurately it was not out of carelessness or spite . Father was tactless but he had been a friend to me . It was loyalty that led me to overlook his indelicate remarks and speak in a voice of my own . <p> All during Father 's sermon the rows held . No one faltered in the chill air or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Afterwards , Father removed his ornate thurible from a velvet-lined casket and lit the incense . He paraded in front of the patient families , swinging the thurible up and back , and then in a full dramatic circle . The cloying scent of burning incense blew into their faces . He marched past the people , behind them , surrounding them with smoke . Spotted Dog tailed after him , imitating the priest 's dignified pace and inspecting his tracks with something like suspicion . I moved to signal the dog but never completed the gesture . A tall figure lunged into the neat lines Father referred to as pews . The intruder clapped his hands and doubled over , his shoulders shaking with laughter . <p> " Sunka Wakan Wanagi , " people murmured . They were whispering his name , Ghost Horse . The community pulled back and watched as he tolled on the ground like a mad colt ; he brayed with laughter and tore the grass with his white teeth . Father La Frambois moved to stand over Ghost Horse , the thurible still rocking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Father said . <p> " No , he is heyo'ka . He dreamed of the thunderbirds , " I tried to explain . <p> " Stop there , stop there ! " Smoke coiled from the thurible like pale ribbon snakes dancing on their tails . I could n't see Father 's face but I could hear his tongue clicking sharply in his mouth . " I thought we were progressing . I believed you were beyond all this . " Father La Frambois trudged back to his guest lodge , his shoulders collapsed in defeat . Spotted Dog trotted behind him , snapping at the threads of smoke and coughing whenever he swallowed the rich vapor . <p> The people quickly dispersed , disappointed with the program , until only Ghost Horse remained , thrashing at my feet . He quieted , sat up and dusted his graceful arms . White streaks of lightning painted his arms and legs , and his face was striped with vertical lines in black and white . A bunch of switchgrass was tied to his forelock , hiding eyes I knew were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind was blowing from the northwest , the place winter came from , but Ghost Horse did n't shiver . He fanned his face and complained of the scorching heat . <p> After dreaming of the giant thunderbirds who could shoot lightning from their glimmering eyes , Ghost Horse had become heyo'ka , a sacred clown . His behavior was perverse : he wept at social dances , laughed at solemn events , shivered in the hot summer sun and sweltered in frigid temperatures . He rushed into battle ahead of other warriors , treating war as play , and he always said the opposite of what he meant . I sensed he was lonely , burdened by his powerful dream , which obligated him to appease the thunder-beings through public humiliation . <p> Ghost Horse stood and shook his limbs as if to rouse himself . I stared at the ground , polite , demure , my legs shaking beneath my dress . " I disappointed the priest , " I finally said . " He does n't understand the way we do things . " <p> Ghost Horse was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That man understands everything . " <p> That winter , as in years past , Father La Frambois failed to secure a single convert . " I 've made headway with other bands . Why are you people so obstinately , willfully blind ? " he asked me . <p> I shall say here what I could n't tell Father La Frambois : his stories did not make sense to us . Bear Soldier , head-chief of our band and my own father , was a logician whose counsel was solicited by other leaders . He listened to the anecdotes I dutifully translated for the priest  --  Cain slaying Abel , Abraham 's willingness to sacrifice Isaac , Joseph delivered into slavery by his jealous brothers  --  and shook his head . My father wanted to know , " Why are his people so determined to kill their relatives ? " <p> So I asked Father , " Why did Cain murder his brother ? " <p> Father pointed at me and shook his finger . " Because he did n't have faith . " <p> I told my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the higher spirits they go crazy . " <p> " Then we 'll pray for them , " he said . <p> My father had seen other bands trade with white people , succumb to diseases and grow dependent upon their superior goods . He decided that we would only trade with our traditional sources : other bands and friendly tribes . Our arrows were tipped with filed bone not metal ; we used the stomach lining of a buffalo to cook our meals rather than shiny kettles ; we passed over mirrors , flour , coffee , and used quills and paint to decorate our clothing rather than the colorful beads from Europe . I felt it would be rude to tell the priest his teachings were just another import for us to resist . Instead I told him , " We will not be degraded . " <p> Father 's mouth fell open and his tongue flicked out and then back in , like an alert frog 's . He swallowed the words he was about to deliver . I quickly apprehended . In Father La Frambois 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he intended to elevate , single-handedly , into the radiant realm of civilization . <p> I dream of that place where the North Platte River crosses the Laramie , a place of soldiers , treaties and immigrant trains . I 've never been there in waking life , but I still recognize Fort Laramie . I 've heard that in springtime this area is a green blanket of lush buffalo grass , but in my dream the ground is dead white . I am walking through a field of  --  what ? My legs push through tall stalks of limp parchment paper , shredded , tattered , a grim harvest sprouting from chalky soil . Death crackles beneath my moccasins . The grass is gone , and the wildflowers and delicate lacewings , the plump grasshoppers , cottonwood trees , the lively killdeer . As far as I can see  --  squinting in every direction  --  the paper spreads , licking across the land like a prairie fire out of control . I want to leave this nightmare . I look at my feet and notice that each step I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggling to grow . <p> I am here for a reason , I tell the wind , and it whips the paper , threatens to tear it from the white plains . I am the uneasy voice of the grass . <p> Like Ghost Horse , my life was altered by a dream . It was decided that I would travel to Fort Laramie after the spring thaw . No one knew what would happen once I arrived  --  assuming I completed the . treacherous journey  --  least of all myself . Father La Frambois had said the Lord called him into service , and this is how I felt ; directed by the spirits . All winter I suppressed a nervous euphoria , vacillating between fear and anticipation . <p> My brother Long Chase was two years younger than I , sixteen , but had already brought down buffalo bulls and accompanied war parries on raids against the Arikara . Long Chase told me : " Tanke , " older sister , " I am coming with you . You can tell me not to , but I 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father La Frambois left before I did to visit more promising bands : Indians who pressed their lips to the large crucifix dangling from his belt , who could chant prayers in Latin . When he departed , his horse seemed aware that the village was watching , and it minced across the prairie , lifting its stocky legs higher than was necessary . <p> I had written the priest a formal farewell message to show off my elegant script and signed it Ester as a final act of kindness . But nowhere in the missive did I mention Fort Laramie or the dream or my coming trip . For years I thought I was shielding Father La Frambois from information I felt he would never understand , would , in fact , find disturbing . It was only as I watched his bent figure diminish to a speck , that I realized my motives were suspect . I had been protecting myself , refusing to speak aloud the legends and ideas I thought would sound absurd in bare English . I nurtured secrecy to avoid derision . Perhaps this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for redemption . <p> The day before my journey was to begin I climbed the flat top of Angry Butte to pray . I added my prayer  --  a heavy flat rock  --  to all the others . They formed a neat pile that rose to my waist . I was careful not to brush my fingers across the other invocations , this place was so powerful I thought I could hear the stones speak . My foot slipped on a round pebble and I fell on my back with such force the wind left my body . I looked for the pebble with angry intentions . I found it touching a second stone , its duplicate , and scooped them into my hand . The stones were perfectly round and unblemished . I lifted one to my cheek , it was impossibly smooth . <p> " They are twin sisters , " my mother told me when I showed them to her . " You were meant to find them . " I painted them red , the color of life , and wrapped them in soft buckskin . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Frambois in my thoughts , though the purpose was a mystery to me . <p> The next is hard to say , the picture is so vivid . Bear Soldier and Black Moon stood in front of their lodge , their hands fastened on my sister 's frail shoulders . Walks Visibly winced in pain . She anchored them there , too young to follow me as Long Chase would . No one cried , it would be disrespectful to the spirits who had planned this course of action , but the family must have feared it would never see me or my brother again . <p> This is what we looked like as we slipped into the unknown . One pony carried our household goods , our water , fire horn , pemmican and jerky . The other carried a small lodge , the smoked hides lashed onto the poles . Long Chase carried a compact short bow and would ride ahead . We had both packed moccasins stolen from enemy tribes  --  Cow and Afikara  --  to wear in their territory so our tracks would n't give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down only to jump up again , running between the ponies ' legs . " You 'll get kicked in the head , " my bother warned him . " Settle down . " The dog sighed and crouched impatiently . <p> The last face I saw was partially hidden by a clump of switchgrass . Ghost Horse moved quickly past everyone else , his arms and legs flashing , a lightning storm in our midst . He chuckled as he handed me a smoked shield of tough buffalo bull hide . I turned it over to inspect its face . It pictured a woman in a red dress clutching an arrow of lightning in her hand . She seemed fierce , unfamiliar . Twenty-one rattlesnake rattles dangled from the bottom edge of the shield , so with each step I sounded like a den of restless snakes . <p> Ghost Hose grinned at me , baring his perfect teeth , but the one eye I could see beneath cords of grass was so red he could have been weeping blood . I clutched the shield as I mounted my pony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seized the bridle and for one moment tossed the grass from his forehead . <p> " I will never miss you , " he said . <p> That day there was a white sky . Clouds choked the horizon and crowded the sun . The sky was so low we were in the sky , we were air , we wee something other than what we had been before . <p> " Tanke , " I heard my brother whisper . " The spirits are all around us . " <p> We traveled southwest on the heels of Spotted Dog who glanced over his shoulder every few steps to be certain he was heading in the right direction . <p> " You 're not fooling us , " my brother called to him . " You 're not in charge . " The pale sky sapped my spirits . I was glad when the sun burned through the clouds , and searing light peeled back layers of mist . We rode into a valley of trembling flowers , the lacy petals fluttered in the wind . <p> " Butterflies , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swallowtail butterflies , their creamy wings edged in blue . I had never seen so many in one place . There were enough of them to bend stems of grass , they dripped from the stalks . <p> " The ancestors are watching us , " I said . " Look at how many we have . " <p> The butterflies lifted then in a rippling cloud and took over the sky . My brother stopped his pony to watch what looked like a snowstorm in reverse , the drifts banking heaven . " This is an odd day , " he finally said . <p> Father La Frambois was frequently in my thoughts . How would he have explained what happened next ? I would have told him : Father , we stepped into a dream , into a world governed by the spirits . Father , for two weeks we never saw another person ; no tribesmen , no enemies , only passing herds of elk and antelope . My brother carried his short bow , and I held my shield , and Spotted Dog pretended to lead the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we marched across the territory as if we were the only creatures in the land . We covered the distance in two weeks and camped within sight of the fort , dazed and exhausted . Even Spotted Dog collapsed in a careless sprawl . <p> " What happens next ? " Long Chase asked me . <p> " Tomorrow we visit the fort . One thing at a time . " <p> He looked at me , and I saw the boy in his face , the deep pucker of dimples on either side of his mouth he tried so hard to smooth . The edge of one thick braid was clamped between his teeth , rolled back and forth to produce a wet squeak . He caught himself and spat the braid from his mouth . He trusted that I understood what had brought us here . I did n't . But as the older sister I flashed a smile and told him : " Tomorrow will be an adventure . Your friends would be jealous . " <p> That night I noticed that Spotted Dog crept beside Long Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All night their hearts beat together . <p> Upstream from the fort was a village I would later hear the soldiers refer to as Squaw Town . This was the place we visited first . The people who lived there were our cousins  --  a different band of the same tribe . Their leader was a man with a name I have forgotten because I thought of him as Death Shirt , and when my brother and I spoke of him , that was the name we used . His cloth shirt was decorated with tiny metal snuffboxes  --  sinister as coffins  --  pierced and sewn so closely together he jangled . He wore a soldier 's forage cap squashed low on his head and fagged moccasins shedding beads . He blinked at me and then at Long Chase . We were wearing our ceremonial clothes , our finest buckskins . My dress was painted red and decorated with elk teeth , and my brother 's shirt dyed blue and stitched with quilled stars  --  he was a piece of the sky . <p> Death Shirt shuffled his feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ancestors ? " <p> " No , " I said . " Where we come from we still dress the old way . " <p> He passed his hand across his eyes , and I noticed three parallel scars on his chin . " Come with me , " he said . <p> We were led through the village and several times I heard Long Chase draw breath too quickly . He stepped close to me and whispered in my ear , " Unsika . " Pitiful . The children were barefoot , chewing their fingers , and their mothers stood with long hair unbraided , tangling in the wind . Many of them wore fabric clothes that were coming apart at the seams . <p> " These ones come from a long time ago , " Death Shirt told the village , gesturing at the two of us . <p> Some of the women were crying , but silently , tears running quick as water . Gifts were pressed into our hands : pebbles , berries , a handful of earth beans and another of parched corn . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She lifted her arm like a hunter wielding a lance and tilled her tongue in thunderous rolls , she could have had a thousand tongues . My brother and I shook hands with our cousins and packed the gifts in parfleche containers strapped to our ponies . We handed out presents of out own : moccasins , jerky and our last cake of pemmican . The women continued to praise us with their voices , even after we rode away . By the time we reached Fort Laramie the noise was a sad drone , like bees singing in our ears . <p> Fort Laramie was little more than a hodgepodge of buildings scattered across a flat plain . Mismatched structures of white washed adobe and blond wood cluttered the area , framed by Laramie Peak some fifty miles to the west . The soldiers smelled of rancid butter and looked uncomfortably warm in their uniforms . When I introduced myself as Esther and Long Chase as Joseph , and tilted my head so the silver crosses I wore fell forward , we were told that the Post Chaplain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet us . <p> " He 's convinced the Sioux will never be real Christians , " the private said . <p> We were led beyond the parade grounds to a cluster of cottonwood trees hunched together like old men . I saw the giant 's back and smelled his malodorous top hat of poorly tanned beaver hide , from several yards away . He was shooting at a tree , I thought , until we were close enough to see that he had nailed a dozen bull snakes to the trunk and was methodically firing at their heads . They were still moving , rippling against the wood . I had to look at the ground . My brother touched my arm to comfort me . His fingers felt like five smooth serpents wrapped around my wrist . <p> Reverend Pyke turned , and I looked into his eyes . They were a remarkable color , somewhere between green and black , charred , like burnt grass . A broad forehead dominated his features and his brown beard was n't on his chin but below it , like a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red skin was peeling in several places , and he hungered the patches as he stared at me . He did n't seem to notice my brother . <p> The first words he spoke were : " Mine enemies are lively and they are strong , and they that hate me wrongfully are multiplied . " In unison we continued : " They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries , because I follow the thing that good is . " <p> Pyke thrust his fingers in his beard and scratched the hidden flesh . " Do you follow the thing that good is ? " he asked me . <p> " I would if I knew what that was , " I replied . <p> He nodded his great head , substantial as a cannonball . " You are of upright conversation , " he said . <p> As easily as that I attached myself to the fort , becoming a kind of personal secretary to Reverend Pyke . " I want to know what my left hand is doing , " he bellowed on that first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself off as the Christian Father La Frambois had tried so long to create . I relished the irony and would have been rather smug were it not for the fact that each day was a step into the void . I was no closer to understanding the purpose of my mission . <p> My brother and I camped between the fort and the village of our cousins , and went in opposite directions for most of the day . Long Chase had befriended several young warriors and together they trekked north to find game . " You 're a good influence on them , " I told him one evening . " You 're already so capable . " He scowled to hide his pleasure . <p> Long Chase had instructed Spotted Dog to watch over me , so every morning the dog led me to the fort and settled in a corner of the patched windowless lean-to Pyke referred to as his study . A vast mirror hung above his desk , its gilt frame a horror of twisted vines and sharp leaves ; angry-looking foliage . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was alone in that room I stepped to the looking glass and touched my reflection with a finger . It was the only time I 'd seen myself in a proper mirror , but the glass was so wavy it was like staring into water . I was struck by how my mouth tipped downwards in a child 's pout , and I had n't realized that I watched the world through my eyelashes . I did n't observe myself for very long . My eyes were the same shape as my mother 's , curved like wings , watching them made me lonesome . <p> I transcribed Pyke 's sermons , my hand dipping into ink like a bird pecking at water and then sweeping across the page to keep pace with the rapid language . I knew the Bible well enough to catch when Pyke departed from his own words to quote Scripture . One passage he returned to again and again , while his fingers wandered over the silver revolver he kept on his blotter , " The wicked have drawn out the sword and bent their bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say such as be of upright conversation . Their sword shall enter their own heart , and their bows shall be broken . " <p> Pyke often raged in the study , his lecture becoming personal , perhaps more revelatory than he intended . " I 'm a child of the wilderness , " he told me . " God 's child . I sprouted from the earth like a bean . No mother , no father , no strangling ties to come between me and the Lord . " <p> Pyke was never without his smelly top hat and on the windiest days managed to keep it glued to his enormous head . His fingers were strangely flat and pale as grubs , except for the rim of dirt under the nails . I observed that while his flesh was none too clean , and I believe his clothes had never been scrubbed , he was fastidious about his space . His cherry-wood desk was so well polished it looked as if crimson flames burned beneath the surface , his books were regularly dusted and arranged in terms of size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the planks forming the study floor  --  though gapping and uneven  --  were soaped and buffed to reveal the wood 's golden heart . Insect life was n't safe in his presence , he crushed what he could , and Pyke said there was nothing natural about the natural world ; it was an evil disorder requiring the cleansing hand of God . When he came across a spider 's sac of eggs nestled in the folds of his heavy jacket , he squashed it with his fingers and licked them clean . <p> " I 've swallowed the spit of Satan , " he announced . <p> He watched me while I worked . I kept my eyes on the papers before me but I could feel him staring and I could smell the sharp decay of his hat . I marveled that his fingers never grabbed me by the braids , tearing me from the earth so that I too was no longer part of the natural world but his creature , a lifeless polished trophy like the preserved prairie dog mounted on a block of wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his throat or the silver revolver , and I labored to set down Pyke 's vision of America : a place where animals were bred for food behind neat fences , mountains were leveled , valleys filled , rivers straightened and grass trained with a ruler . <p> " Man is the organizer , " he said . " Adam named the creatures , mastered the elements and answered to no one but the Lord . This is the legacy we must claim for ourselves . " <p> I scratched the words onto stiff paper but had the sudden urge to yank the land from beneath Pyke 's feet like a slippery rug . <p> On Sundays I sat in the back of the low-ceilinged hall Reverend Pyke borrowed for his services and tried not to envy Long Chase his freedom . Pyke 's voice did n't have anywhere to go in the small space , even the thick wool uniforms could n't absorb the fierce syllables , so his commotion penetrated my ears like a great clanging bell . I watched the congregation through my eyelashes , practiced stillness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fist-sized Indian pony , all kicking legs and snapping tail . I slowed its gallop to a walk and measured each step it took . I run my own body , I thought . <p> The handful of officers ' wives sat together towards the front , surrounded by their husbands . I could n't tell if the women were fenced in or the men shut out . I was fascinated by their pallor , a white so pale it was tinted blue , like thin milk . Their clothes squeezed the breath from them and rendered their bodies tight as bow strings . I longed to reach out and pluck them , play their one quavering note . The laundresses from Soapsuds Row and the housekeepers sat behind them , decidedly healthier in complexion . These ladies had tired feet that looked to be planted for eternity , and darting eyes . I do n't know how many of Pyke 's words they digested , they seemed intent on soaking up the subterranean sounds of people trapped together : the rustles , coughs , whispers , sighs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group and sat to the far right of the congregation , so diminutive he feet did n't touch the ground . Pyke had said she was a recent widow and it seemed so , her black dress was still crisp and tidy , unlike those of other widows who turned them inside-out after a time to get more wear . The color pinched her even tighter than her corset and in profile she nearly vanished like the flat of a sword , except for her breasts , tiny and round as ground cherries . I soon noticed that while this lady always wore black she also managed a spot of color , perhaps a folding fan , a ribbon pinned beneath her brooch , a nodding sunflower threaded into her bonnet . I thought of these items as her intentions speaking through . <p> One morning at dress parade I found myself standing beside the widow . She interested me more than the mechanical movements of the soldiers who stretched across the horizon , their white gloves gleaming like teeth . <p> " Oh , look at the guidons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other dabbed at her upper lip with a square of delicate lace . The flags streamed behind the soldiers , pulled taut by the wind . The sky was pasted with the company colors . Sweeping gusts took most of the sounds  --  the orders being called , the jingling of spurs and harnesses , the indignant snorts of cavalry horses  --  so the parade became an eerie drama of tremendous silent activity . I was unimpressed with the display , it struck me as the kind of thing Pyke would have dreamed up in his hankering for artificial order , simulated grace . But I said something appreciative to the widow , to make out I was enjoying the spectacle as much as she did . <p> When the soldiers were given orders to retire and began leaving the field , the widow turned to me . Her eyes were light brown and unusually bright , they reminded me of the nuggets of fool 's gold Father La Frambois carried in his pocket . " I 'm Fanny Brindle , " she said . " You 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she touched my arm with one finger . " That 's not a complaint , it 's an observation . " <p> Fanny Brindle removed her hat . Her dark blond hair was pinned up but seemed to strain against the combs , several wisps rolled across the slopes of her head like miniature tumbleweeds . She had a tight little face and sharp nose that pointed downwards , steady as a compass . <p> " Are you a woman alone ? " she asked me . <p> " No , " I shook my head . " I have my brother Joseph , and my dog , and  --  " Here I should have said something about the Lord to continue my pose as a Christian Sioux , but I forgot myself . " And my ancestors are looking out for me , " I said . <p> Fanny did n't notice . " I am alone , " she said . " My husband was Sergeant Guy Brindle , but he died three months ago from scarlet fever . I dosed him with potassium chlorate and ordered him not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " She wrenched a tall sunflower from the ground and tucked it into her belt . " Not to worry , though . It was n't a love match . I came here as a governess , and he offered me an easier life than that . I think it 's the reason polite company wo n't breathe in my direction . I used to enter their rooms by the back door . <p> " We should be friends , " Fanny told me . She laughed and nudged the dirt with her toe . " I ca n't get any lower . " <p> Fanny 's artlessness  --  some would have said , thoughtlessness  --  was part of her charm . I began to think of her as a sunflower , all open face and spitting seeds . She liked to stroll from one end of the fort to the other , her slender twig of an arm hooked through mine . She was eager to share the latest gossip gleaned from Bailey Roe , the enlisted man who had worked for her husband as strike and still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of remarkable hearing and recall , " she confided . " His word is gospel . " <p> It was early October , Canwapekasna Wi , the moon when the leaves rustle . The buffalo grass was a drab brown and winter 's breath swirled across the plain . Pyke was working on a treatise titled , " Laramie , the Lord 's Outpost , " and did n't release me or the watchful Spotted Dog until the sun was well into its downward arc . On these days Fanny met me at the door of Pyke 's study , quickly taking my arm and heading in the direction of the river . Fanny was n't one to stifle her curiosity . She came right out and asked me : " Does he pay you for the work you do ? " <p> " I do n't think he makes much more than the enlisted men , " I said . " But he takes me to the sutler 's store every now and then for . supplies . " <p> " Well , he should , " Fanny sniffed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pyke and the others at the fort in silence , speaking in my head . The truth had to let itself out some way or I would have confused myself . What I said in the secrecy of my thoughts was : Fanny , mazaska  --  the white iron you call money  --  is useless to me . Even the goods I tae m the sutler 's store , the flour , coffee , sugar and tobacco , the knives and blankets , are things I do not want . I give them to my cousins who live upriver . <p> Fanny squeezed my arm impatiently  --  perhaps she saw these ideas moving across my forehead  --  and said : " Do you know what they 're saying about you ? That you 're a princess . " I did n't react but she nodded her head in affirmation . " Yes , a Sioux princess with the light of the world in your heart , and a devotion to Jesus Christ that is so pure your soul is white as cream . I think it 's because of your remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't conceive of it as anything but a miracle , and it is , you know . It is . " <p> I smiled at Fanny , assured her that I was n't a princess and thanked her for complimenting my speech . But what I really said to Fanny was , " Kola , friend , look at this sullen brown grass , dispirited because winter is coming to punish it . This , to me , is English . It is little pebbles on my tongue , gravel , the kind of thing you chew but can not swallow . Dakota is the lush spring grass that moves like water and tastes sweet . " <p> By November , Waniyetu Wi , the month of the winter moon , Fanny could not be persuaded to go on long walks but remained in her room , wrapped in a heavy shawl . I visited her there though it shamed her to have company , even mine , in such a place . After her husband died a new lieutenant had claimed his apartments as a superior officer was entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home and into a narrow hallway of the same quarters . The young lieutenant was sensitive enough to her plight to avoid using the hallway ; he left and entered his rooms via the window . <p> An overstuffed divan pushed against one wall served as her couch and bed , and she told me that she washed and dressed in the huge walnut wardrobe which took up so much of the hallway one could barely squeeze past it . Sergeant Brindle 's photograph dominated a mother-of-pearl inlaid table , and while he may have looked bright and hopeful if you saw the picture alone , the drumming clock placed beside it cast a shadow across his face so that he looked wistful , aware of the coming fever . <p> " He was n't very handsome , was he ? " Fanny said . It had been decided , so I knew better than to respond . " But he was n't cruel or petty , you can see the kindness , there , in his mustache . " Fanny pointed to meager wisps of hair sprouting above a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . " Do you think you 'll marry again ? " <p> " I hope to , " she said , without a breath o any pause . " Oh , it would be a shame to be here , so outnumbered by men they 're thick as fleas , and not claim another . I work on it a little . " Her face flushed then , becoming a red mask , " I go to all the hops , and dance and dance until I lose my feet , forget my toes were ever there . I just float in the officers ' arms and turn into a cloud . " She laughed . " A rather black cloud . Well , they have fair warning then ? " Fanny looked at her little feet , tapped her heels together and grinned so broadly her eyes squeezed shut . <p> Fanny 's mention of fleas proved prescient . The fort suffered a terrible infestation of the pests , flourishing despite the cold weather . The enlisted men blamed a recent shipment of blankets , though the sutler blanched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my skin and Spotted Dog 's fur with buffalo grease and ashes , so we did n't suffer , but Pyke , the soldiers , and even the fine ladies were patched with welts and scabs from zealous scratching . <p> Fanny decided to organize a theatrical to take everyone 's mind off the plague . <p> " I want to be distracted , do n't you ? " she asked . When I did n't answer quickly enough she said , " Oh , you . You are n't bothered in the slightest . I can see it . They do n't like that Indian blood , do they ? " No , I had to admit they did n't . <p> The next day she tacked up a neat sign on the porch of Old Bedlam  --  the unmarried officers ' quarters  --  announcing the staging of Macbeth . <p> " You have to help me with this , " she pleaded , so I became her assistant . <p> I had read the play aloud under the tutelage of Father La Frambois and was curious to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Reverend Pyke might disapprove of the scheme , but he supported it and in fact landed a role , three roles to be precise , since he would play all three of the witches . <p> " Measured fun is a holy pleasure , " Pyke blasted that Sunday to a chorus of nodding heads . <p> A stage only slightly larger than an oven range was erected in the front parlor of Old Bedlam , and auditions were held in the evening between Stable Call and Retreat . Pyke was cast as the three witches because there simply was n't room for more of them onstage . Many of the roles were combined and speeches cut . Fanny insisted we would get to the meat of the story and trim the rest , and by the time the officers in the company had their say , the scenes were mostly swordplay , complete with uncorked sabres and plumed hats . One of my jobs was to prompt the actors in their lines , what lines remained , and the text became as familiar to me as Scriptures until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as readily as passages from Ecclesiastes . <p> Long Chase was curious about my activities and asked me what I was doing . There was no term in Dakota for " Assistant Director , " so I said I was helping the wasicuns tell stories . Then I told him about the fleas and leapt on my pony to imitate the soldiers ' odd canter , how they leaned forward in the saddle to scratch their ankles . Long Chase collapsed on the ground , clutching his fibs and rolling with laughter . Spotted Dog jumped over him , barked , thrust his wet nose into Long Chase 's face . <p> " That was a good one , " my brother said when he could finally speak . <p> During the two-week rehearsal period I became acquainted with several of the officers I 'd previously thought of as faceless . <p> The three I came to know best were those with the largest roles , needing the most prompting from my corner . It was my opinion that Fanny had miscast them , each woefully unsuited to the part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky eyes and blond hair like moist honey dripping to his shoulders . He was polished , without being insincere , and had the smoothest voice , really it was like the bolt of silk I 'd seen in the sutler 's store . He never failed to notice the lurking Spotted Dog and spoke to him so gently the dog came forward and bowed his head , then , in perfect Dakota etiquette , lifted one pumpkin-colored paw to shake hands . And this man would play the irresolute tyrant ? I would have chosen Captain Philander Merritt , the handsomest of the three and the most inscrutable . His pale skin glimmered against hair that was thick and black as my own , eyes brown as acorns . His long eyelashes fluttered before he spoke and white teeth perched prettily on his bottom lip when he smiled , but there was tension in his face and shoulders , lines in his young forehead that made me question his friendliness . His body was compact but dense , and as the betrayed Banquo who returns as a ghost to haunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world for me to ever imagine dead . <p> Finally , the bold , heroic Macduff who so capably vanquishes Macbeth would be portrayed by Lieutenant Lemon Van Horn , youngest of the officers and the one whose questions frequently went unanswered because no one heard him . I could tell that his uniform had been altered to hide a wispy figure , but his face was found , plumped out by soft jowls too smooth for whiskers . His face was fairly red with freckles and his hair red-gold , though lusterless , like his spirits . People seemed to either confuse or tire him , and when he mocked Macbeth during the play 's climax , charging . " Turn , hell-bound , turn ! " it was with great drawn-out sighs . <p> Lady Macbeth proved to be the most difficult part to cast since the ladies felt it would be undignified to participate , and Fanny could n't cast herself . At the last minute she convinced a recent arrival to the fort , the young wife of a non-commissioned officer , Melody Kendall , to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough but had to be dissuaded from wearing hoops and the latest gown from Boston , decorated with fabric roses large as cabbages . " Ringlets will never do , " Fanny scolded gently . She pointed to the tight clusters springing above Melody 's ears . <p> The night of the performance Fanny was in a generous mood . She ushered me to a seat near the front , just behind the commanding officers and their carefully coiffed wives who surreptitiously , or so they thought , scratched beneath smooth waves of hair , behind spread fans . <p> " You 've made a hit , " she whispered loudly in my ear . " Just look at you . Old Bedlam will never be the same . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " Oh , you . Everyone 's half mad with love , or maybe lust . " Here she pinched my forearm so enthusiastically it hurt . <p> " No , no , " I demurred , quite honestly . <p> Fanny sat down beside me , and her small forehead worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you 're beautiful ? " she asked . I felt Spotted Dog shift against my leg . Fanny picked up one of my hands as casually as she would a teacup . " Look at this , look at these long delicate bones , nails glossy as porcelain . I ca n't stand it . " She dropped my hand and fell back into the chair in one motion . " I think it 's that curl of a smile that finally does them in , partway between a sneer and a laugh . Makes them work to impress you . <p> " I thought you knew , " she concluded . " I thought it was a manipulation . " <p> I could only shake my head at Fanny , my friend who was surely carried away by the night 's festivities and her own complicated flirtations . <p> A brocade curtain rigged up by Fanny 's striker , Bailey , lifted to enthusiastic applause and so much squirming I thought I could see a fog of fleas rise up and redistribute themselves . Pyke 's witches were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soapy water in one of the laundress ' borrowed tubs . When he came to the familiar chorus  --  " Double , double toil and trouble ; fire burn and cauldron bubble "  --  there emerged a dozen witches as soldiers in the audience shouted the lines with him . <p> Too often actors absentmindedly raked fingernails through beards or across their flesh to discourage the biting fleas , but since the spectators were similarly afflicted it was overlooked . Lady Macbeth , as it turned out , was determined to be fashionable , and her hoops took up the entire stage , causing anyone sharing her scenes to stand on the floor and gaze up at her . Her ringlets bounced with passion , eliciting titters from the crowd , and one man snickered loudly when she scratched rather than rubbed the imagined spot of blood on her hand , all the while wearing elbow-length kidskin gloves and twirling an open parasol . <p> The final battle was vigorously performed , an exchange of blows that went on for nearly half an hour , but when the curtain plunged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor was filled with a happy buzz . The ladies produced eggnog , and I was about to leave , when Lemon Van Horn  --  Macbeth 's cloth head still tucked under one arm  --  handed me a glass of the creamy liquid . <p> " You are n't leaving ? " he said in his weary voice . <p> Surrounded by Lemon , Royal , a handful of other officers and even the wary Merritt , I saw truth in Fanny 's observations . I felt stifled by attention and sought comfort in Spotted Dog , resting at my feet . I spread my fingers through his coarse fur and felt the regular rhythm of his heart pulsing beneath my fingertips . He occasionally rolled his eyes to meet mine and would n't look away until I smiled . <p> What can trey possibly want from me ? I wondered . A midnight rendezvous in Squaw Town ? Something furtive and shameful , to be quickly forgotten ? The eggnog left a sour taste ; I ran my tongue across my teeth and nearly gagged . I sat as straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they chose to read my expression . I was careful not to look into their eyes so there would be no message . <p> The men chattered , told anecdotes and in the telling staggered or waved their arms , jumped onto chairs , pounded their comrades on the back , punched shoulders . It became a blur of sound and movement : I associated with the smell of curdled cream . Somewhere during the mayhem I slipped my hand into the quilled pouch dangling from my waist . My fingers searched for a sliver of the bitter muskrat root which would quickly change the taste in my mouth . I touched something else . Two smooth stones clicking together , released from buckskin wrapping . I cupped one in my palm to be certain of the object . Earlier that evening when I left the lodge I shared with my brother , these stones had been buried in a shallow hole beneath my pallet . Some hidden force had pushed them through the ground , propelled them through the air , and tucked them into my bag where they nested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose , I told the officers . But in my private way , which was no warning . <p> I am leaving Old Bedlam , which has lived up to its name on this occasion . Men watch me as I travel lightly down the steps . Now I am a dark figure , a shadow moving across the yard . I bend smoothly to place the stones beneath a clump of weeds , not knowing I would do it . Every step , every gesture is natural , spontaneous . I am inevitable as light or darkness , steady as rain . I push out my breath to match the wind and soar in the direction of my brother 's sleep . Spotted Dog is ahead of me , grinning to himself as he leads the way . <p> I 'm coming , I sing to him . I 'm coming . But now I think I 'm telling the ancestor-spirits who have waited so long for me to move , as I am moving now . <p> Upon arriving I do n't enter the lodge , but sit outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leans into my side , lets his weight fall against me . For once I am the alert one , impervious to chill winds and tired feet , to hunger and thirst . " You rest , " I tell him . <p> Later I will find myself standing beside the river , drawn to the battered cottonwood tree blasted by a revolver . I am utterly alone I will hear the man before I see him . He is not so graceful , his stumbling feet churn the dry grass . Whiss . Whiss . He is the sleepy one with red hair and freckles , the one whose voice is easily lost . He walks to me without hesitation and does n't flinch when I teach for his hand . The stones are there , clenched in the fist I peel open one finger at a time . I return the stones to my pouch and pluck a strand of hair from my head . I lean into the man as I wind the thread of hair around a brass button on his jacket ; the slow circles enchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a cartridge belt . I tell him what to do . I look into his eyes for the first time and see only myself . I have forgotten their color . I leave him to his work , turning my back on the man and the tree . <p> I will return to Long Chase and Spotted Dog , sidestepping their dreams as I make my way to the buffalo hide I use to cover myself . I will not see how the man , so recently a boy , climbs the tree and coils the rope as tenderly as I wound hair around the button beneath his heart . He will be graceful as he steps into black air , the night space , flying for a long moment . And when he is forced to land , I will not see the color of his face . The sudden emptiness . <p> It was Pyke , prowling the fort 's perimeter on his early morning reconnaissance with the Lord , who came across Lemon Van Horn hanging from a cottonwood tree . His boots were only a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have looked to Pyke as if Lemon were just standing in front of the tree . <p> " He has thrown his soul to the dogs , " Pyke growled that day . " He will languish in purgatory for what he has done . Quick , Esther , take this down . I will address the subject on Sunday . " <p> I had noticed before that any mention of the loss of human life filled Pyke with a peculiar dread . I do n't mean the inevitable sorrow , of the rage one feels when a loved one dies , but a terrible fear penetrating his thoughts , drilling his bones . <p> " Man is close to almighty , he should not be cut down . And to tear himself out of the world  --  this is an abomination ! " Pyke stamped across the study floor , his arms flung open and fingers trembling . " I am unsettled , " he said . His candor took me by surprise . He tore at the strip of fur beneath his chin and strode past me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . <p> I observed Pyke closely to escape my own feelings which were heavy as a hundred stones . I am at war , I told myself , knowing it was more complicated than that . I was also at war with myself . <p> I do not know who the stones will claim next . They are like red eyes that can see everything . Moonlight washes over me like a graceful blessing . This man is silent as he approaches the river , carrying a coiled lasso of rope . I ca n't hear his steps or the rope slapping against his thigh , but I can feel the force of his will . His black hair fades into the night , so the fair skin beneath that dark crest is like a torch . This man 's body shudders with a dense quivering , his mind attempting to surface . The shaking stops him in his tracks . I move forward gently as a pulse of air and take the stones from his hand . <p> He is gasping as I wind a strand of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tightly than before , longing to be finished so I can release him . His eyes are burning at the core , the pin of light at the center of his black pupil . He would like to kill me , but he can not will his hands to do it . <p> " You are another one we wo n't have to fight , " I tell him , but it is n't enough . I am forced to watch this time . The tree is hard to climb , several times he slides down the trunk . His movements are slow , reluctant . But the rope nearly twists itself . <p> A week before Christmas Fanny Brindle organized a skating party . " This will lift our spirits , " she declared . Most of the officers and their families turned out , grateful for the distraction , though Pyke was conspicuously absent . <p> After Philander Merritt was found dangling from the same tree where Lemon had cast his tope , Pyke took an axe to it and not only felled the tree but chopped it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so he tossed the chunks of wood into the river , watching grimly as they swirled away . I knew he was probably brooding in his study as we gathered beside the now frozen river , studiously avoiding the forlorn cottonwood stump . <p> " I am lost in a mysterious world , " he had told me just the day before . He even grabbed my hand as I made ready to leave , kneading it with his flat paws . " Death is chaos , " he said . <p> I was happy to be on the river where the cold wind drew tears from my eyes and whipped my mind clean . Several of the soldiers had crude blades strapped onto their boots and were moving across the ice like delicate insects skimming water . Their weight shifted from side to side in an elegant rhythm , hypnotizing me as I stood wrapped in a small buffalo calf robe . <p> The ladies without skates were being pushed in wooden chairs , whirled quickly on the ice , evoking cries of pleasure . Fanny was there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside a muff of beaver hide . She waved to me , then nearly lost the muff as she grabbed for the chair 's back . Her face spun away . <p> Royal Bourke approached , his sky eyes wide with happiness and shoulders sparkling with snow . " Why are you standing here ? " he asked me . " Why are n't you laughing ? " <p> I avoided his blue gaze by counting his brass buttons . " I like to watch , " I said . <p> " That is n't good enough . " He extended his arm , and I took it as lightly as I could . He settled me in a sturdy ladder-back chair and then pressed me forward into currents of bright air ; a place without breath or sound . The sky became a wheel as I twirled on the ice , the clouds streaming together and the sun becoming a long string of suns . I smiled , I bent over to laugh into my hands . The chair stopped . <p> " What 's wrong ? " Royal asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and laughed a little more . " Oh , good . I thought you were dizzy , " he chuckled . <p> " I was . But it was nice , " I told him . <p> When I thought Royal must surely be tired of the game  --  though he protested he could push me straight to Canada  --  I joined Fanny beside a table set with steaming mugs of cider . <p> " Was n't it wonderful ? " she asked . " It breaks my heart to go back to my hallway . I tell you , I wake up with frost on my eyebrows , hugging nothing friendlier than a can of yeast . To keep it warm , you know , or it would freeze like my potatoes . They 're hard as rocks . " Fanny sipped cider so tenderly it was almost like a kiss . " How do you make out in nothing better than a tent ? " <p> I told her how Long Chase and I had built a willow stockade around our tipi , with a small runway for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked the smoke flaps so we could build a fire in the lodge , the flames keeping us warm all night . " And Spotted Dog warms my feet , " I said . His ears flicked forward at the mention of his name . <p> Later that night I told Long Chase about my dizzy ride . <p> " I wish I 'd seen that . You must have looked funny , " he teased . " We were playing too , " he continued . " I made those kids a sled out of buffalo ribs , and we took it up there , " he pointed to a distant coulee . <p> " That was a good thing , " I said . I was proud of my generous brother who spent so many hours with the children of our cousins , teaching them things the old people in their village only talked about . But it was not our way to fuss over one another , my terse praise was enough . <p> I looked forward to sleep that night , having exhausted myself the way children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did every night , for the sacred stones I collected from Angry Butte and transported to this place of dying grass . My fingers anticipated their sleek texture , stretched eagerly to graze their faces . I marvelled at the warmth they emanated , even packed in frozen ground . I scratched the dirt , eventually turning my hands into claws that raked the earth . But it was useless , the stones were gone . <p> The sentries are sleepy by the time I reach the fort 's perimeter . One dreams with his eyes open , and the other is crushing the snow with his boots to make animal figures . I brush past them , first one and then the other , mad with potent energy , determined to be invisible . I take chances because I think I am the wind . The tree is gone and although there are others , I know better than to head in that direction . I move towards Old Bedlam and mount the stairs leading to its second story porch . I sway at the top , flinging my head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers ' names , I think . I will send them soldiers . <p> I hear footsteps and reach out to grasp the railing . He steps onto the porch and carefully closes the door behind him . He is not drowsy and he does n't resist . I think if I told him to fly he would spread his arms and leap at the moon . He hands me the stones before I look for them and lifts the rope in his hands . It is a coarse snake wound between us . <p> " Give me you hair , " he whispers , complice to this act . I wrap the button , but only once or twice . The thread floats free , and I do n't snatch another from my open braid . He moves to the railing , his steps like a dance , and ties the rope in ugly ways . He slips his head in the loop , and I put out my hand for him to catch . There is a twitch of a smile on my lips because I have called him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the deck . He flies away . <p> Fort Laramie was a place of death  --  I had seen that in my dream  --  but now it was a place of ghosts , some of them living . Pyke retreated like a turtle , reading tracts for most of the day , the reading material in one hand and revolver in the other . <p> " You ca n't help me , " he said when I knocked on his study door . <p> Rope was confiscated , placed under guard , and more soldiers assigned watch duty . Royal Bourke had sky eyes , but now he was buried in a shallow grave laboriously chipped out of the frozen earth . People walked with their heads down , moving briskly to get somewhere . Even Fanny was reclusive , seldom in sight . So I took it upon myself to pay her a visit , bringing her a piece of salt pork Long Chase had received from our cousins . <p> I rapped on her door but there was no answer . I opened it a crack so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I saw . Fanny Brindle was no longer a woman alone . She lay on the divan , pressed into it by the weight of her striker , Bailey Roe . They seemed to have sprouted additional arms and legs , and were flailing them about . They resembled tangled crabs . <p> I chucked the salt pork into a corner and fled the room before the two could find their voices . I nearly stepped on Spotted Dog in my haste , for he lingered at the door . I was short with him . " Move it , " I growled . We walked slowly away from the fort , Spotted Dog beside me rather than loping ahead . Perhaps he noticed the drag of my feet . My limbs were heavy and cut deep tracks through the snow . Loneliness swept across me until I thought my heart would disintegrate like powder . Fanny Brindle was a woman from the other world , but I would miss her . And I had understood , from the moment we latched eyes , that Fanny would never forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends told him that a small buffalo herd had been spotted thirty miles to the north . <p> " Tanke , we 're going to bring some back for your soup so you 'll have something to talk to the corn , " he said . He rubbed the lodge 's skin wall , the smoked hide so worn it was becoming transparent . " We could use some new walls too . We 're like a lantern at night . " <p> Long Chase set off the next morning wearing his buffalo hide shift with the coarse hair against his skin . I knew that before he turned his pony into the fleet stream of buffalos , he would shed the garment . My brother could ride like that , his flesh exposed to temperatures that would have claimed a soldier 's fingers and toes with frostbite , inured to the cold through careful childhood training . He washed in the snow each morning , joined by Spotted Dog who thought it was a romp . I had seen them dive headlong into the powder as if it wee the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand and looked up at him settled on his horse . I did n't tell him to be careful . I did n't tell him anything at all because the child was missing that morning , replaced by a smiling man . He squeezed my hand and gave it back to me . I watched him ride away . I knelt on the ground beside Spotted Dog , my arms wrapped around his neck . The dog looked forlorn , upset to be left behind . He knew where Long Chase was headed after hearing " Tatanka , " the term for buffalo . <p> " You do n't want to leave me all by myself , " I scolded him . And for a moment he lifted his eyes from my bother 's receding back to look at me . His tongue rolled out , the sure sign of forgiveness , so I left him there and moved to tidy our camp . I was visited that night by a bear . Not mato , our fierce brother whose claws are greatly prized , but a human bear bundled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greeting , looking like a man of snow . <p> " Good evening , " I said , polite though his abrupt entrance was rude . I gestured towards the caller 's space to the left of my sputtering fire . " Make yourself comfortable , " I told him . <p> Pyke 's legs were stiff as tree trunks , his head grazed the wall . " I am not calling , " he said to me . " I am not here . " I looked at Spotted Dog as if he had an explanation . " But the Lord is here , " Pyke continued . " The Lord suffuses my soul and expunges the wickedness he finds there with a flick of his tongue . " <p> I was motionless before the raving giant , my senses assailed by his reeking hat and rumbling voice . <p> " The Lord told me that I was blessed , " he continued . " He bade me replenish the earth and subdue it , and have dominion over the fish of the sea , and over the fowl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the earth . You will not work your ways on me , " Pyke thundered . " I made you and fostered your demon intelligence . I will unmake you . " And the one I had not spelled or visited with sacred stones brought his flat hand out of the fur wrappings strapped to his body . He raised his silver revolver , aiming it at my heart . The gun 's barrel was a black eye , and when it exploded , a streak of bright color rose to meet the bullet . Spotted Dog fell at my feet . I knelt beside him and stroked his back . I rubbed the loose skin behind his ears . <p> " You are a brave dog , " I murmured in Dakota , speaking the language I told myself he preferred . His blood spilled across my hands and it was while I struggled to catch each precious drop that the tent exploded a second time . <p> I had turned my back on the giant , he loomed somewhere above me . <p> " Micehpi , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My flesh . <p> I fell into a river of liquid as smooth as the cream wasicuns favored , and in that warm bath drawing me through Ina 's  --  the mother 's  --  heart , I was unperturbed by my own death . The recent events were banished from my mind , and I was free to indulge my sensibilities in ways forbidden me in life . I was raised to believe that discipline and self-control were signs of maturity , necessitating the suppression of individual desires . My feelings swept over me now , I was in a womb of my affections . Music penetrated the fluid and my wandering soul ; a piercing sweetness from our Dakota courting flute . It was a tune composed by Ghost Hose , the thunder dreamer , a melody he played when I carried water from the river or collected wood for kindling . This was in the days before our dreams  --  so devastating in retrospect  --  set us upon divergent courses . My spirit throbbed in anger . I was like an old woman weeping for her children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized . We were Job , lonely and afflicted . Chosen . Only the music could stir me from my sudden brooding . I let it move through me until it became the words I could n't speak and the tears I could not cry . <p> You will think that I was borne away but in fact I was a witness to what followed . I tracked Reverend Pyke in the snow as capably as a coyote . He had n't gone far from the lodge ; the ancestor-spirits had trapped him in the drifts and he was half-buried in snow . My sight was sharper than before so I could see into his deep pockets where twin sisters with red faces clacked together . The sacred stones had moved for the last time . Pyke 's revolver had loosed a final shot , taking him by surprise , I think , for he looked puzzled and his left hand was latched onto his right wrist as if there 'd been a struggle . <p> My brother Long Chase returned hours later with enough buffalo meat , tallow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang for me and for Spotted Dog , gashed his arms and legs to wear his grief and let it pour out of him . He removed the note Reverend Pyke had pinned to my dress . My brother could n't read the words , but knew it was some work of spite . I read the lines , curious as I had ever been : " Upon thy belly shalt thou go , and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life . " <p> I shook my fists and smiled to hear them rattle . Was it madness , I wondered , or a crystal sanity that led him to write these words ? <p> Long Chase quickly discovered Pyke after I nudged him in that direction . I did n't want him seeking vengeance . You see , it 's already done , I told my brother . And then I whispered , Go home . <p> The return trip was a trek of heartbreak , exhaustion and hunger . Long Chase trudged through the snow and rarely looked ahead of him , so defeated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scouted for him , and the few times I spotted distant trouble my spirit made a nuisance of itself , torturing my brother 's adversaries with flung rocks and snowy twisters until they changed direction . <p> Grass was beginning to poke through melting snow when Long Chase reached our winter camp . He emerged from a cloud of horses and was met by Father La Frambois , out for a stroll . My brother walked past him , numbly discourteous , and when the priest moved towards the body the ponies dragged behind them on a bed of furs , Long Chase caught his arm . No words passed between them but Father La Frambois soon gathered that he was shut out of the proceedings . He would not be allowed to handle my body or baptize me posthumously . His blessings and masses were politely refused . He never learned that in death , I finally became a bride . <p> Ghost Horse brought my father three sturdy ponies he 'd captured from the Crows . " I have fulfilled my obligations as heyo'ka , " he told my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife . Your daughter never watched me , sent me messages , or stepped away from herself , but she is in here anyway . " He tapped his chest . " I have these feelings that are only pitiful grains , but they are planted in my blood and growing . " He held out his arms and stared at the veins as if he expected to find bold spikes of grass . <p> " I request the honor of marrying your daughter 's spirit , mounting her as a devoted husband would grieve . " <p> Ghost Horse did not bury me in the ground or build a scaffold , but placed me near the crown of a majestic bur oak tree . I was cradled by its spreading branches , rocked in its stout arms . My husband stood beside me in the tree and looked in every direction . <p> " You will see the world , " he said . He ate the fruit of a dried plum and when its meat was gone , he very gently placed the pit in my mouth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Before he left , my husband lifted the shield he had given me just a year earlier . " I want you to see what I 've done , " he told me . He pointed to fresh tracks of blue paint drawn across the tough bull hide . " I recorded your accomplishments , " Ghost Horse continued . " You ate a warrior and this is your shield . " <p> I peered at the blue marks , my spirit slow to recognize the figures . Comprehension came in a rush , and when my hands flew to cover my eyes , I stirred a powerful wind . My husband nearly fell from the tree . I shrank from the paint , from the woman in a red dress wielding lightning . The jagged bolt was sharp at its tip , and three blue figures  --  men in uniform  --  were impaled by it , collected like beads strung on a needle . <p> Ghost Horse turned the shield to face this fierce woman . " We honor you , " he said . He threaded his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arm in quick circles , making the rattlesnake gourds hiss . My spirit was tangled in the tree , dismayed and bewildered . Who is this woman ? I wondered , and did n't want the answer to come to me . But the rattlesnake gourds produced a soothing sound , and my heart lifted when I saw the creatures emerge from their dens and hiding places . Serpents flowed toward the tree , forming creeks and rivers of writhing motion . They washed over one another , rising and then falling ; they became a single unit of grace . <p> The snakes are dancing , I murmured . And when they surrounded the tree my spirit fell into their midst , prostrate . We danced together . <p> Ghost Horse kept my spirit for one year ; the most onerous form of grief . His younger bother , Wind Soldier , agreed to help him , and together they prepared my spirit lodge and collected goods to be distributed at the culminating feast . But when the year had passed , and the village assembled for my spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was expected of him , said the words and gave away his last possession , but he did not loose me from this earth . His heart was a stone room without doors . <p> My husband sought death on the battlefield , and it was n't long before a bold Arikara complied . I did my best to deflect the arrows , pushed the air with both hands to send them swerving harmlessly away . But the Ree 's horse would n't stumble when I leapt for its legs . It carried him so close to my husband , the Ree 's shot was deadly , and by the time I reached Ghost Horse he was on the ground . <p> I thought he might see me now that his eyes were focused on the next world . I held his head in my arms and spread his long hair across my thighs . Old man , I teased , are you ready for this old lady ? But he was silent , and his polished eyes were stones . <p> I did n't see him leave though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved on to the place our ancestors inhabit ; there was no one living to capture his spirit as mine had been . <p> " You went without me ! " I cried . I shook him by the shoulders . My spirit stubbornly clutched his body which made it hard for his uncles to lift him . " We go together ! " I shrieked in their ears . I finally departed when Ghost Horse 's pony spooked and almost flung his body back to the ground . The uncles were horrified and scolded the horse , but I understood its terror . It did n't want me on its back . <p> At least a hundred years have passed , and the plum pit in my mouth has become a grove of trees . I can smell the fruit when it ripens , and my breath makes the leaves rustle . <p> I am hitched to the living , still moved by their concerns . My spirit never abandons the Dakota people , though sometimes all it can do is watch . I was there when the army confiscated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the Ghost Dancers and when they fainted in desperate , useless ecstasy , I blew a refreshing wind into their faces . There have been too many soldiers and too many graves . Too many children packed into trains and sent to the other side of the country . Many times I ran alongside those tracks and waved at the bleak copper faces . You are Dakota , I called to them . You are Dakota . One time I stood in front of a chuffing engine and tried to keep it from moving forward , but it blasted through me . I saw the language shrivel , and though I held out my hands to catch the words , so many of them slipped away , beyond recall . I am a talker now and chatter in my people 's ears until I grow weary of my own voice . I am memory , I tell them when they 're sleeping . <p> I prefer to watch the present unravel moment by moment , than to look close behind me or far ahead . Time extends from me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving beyond to follow the curve of the earth . But I will not track its course with my eyes . It is too painful . I can bear witness to only a single moment of loss at a time . Still , hope flutters in my heart ; a delicate pulse . I straddle the world and pray to Wakan Tanka that somewhere ahead of me He has planted an instant of joy . <p>
