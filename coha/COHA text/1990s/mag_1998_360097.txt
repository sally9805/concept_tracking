I bet the casinos of Las Vegas actually lose money during the week of Comdex . The annual high-tech event is by far the country 's largest trade show , with more than 200,000 people showing up this year . For a week some of the wiliest folks from the world 's richest and most powerful companies drop in on a place that specializes in separating fools from their money . Every night the pocket-protector crowd flocks to the gaming tables , and you can see the pit bosses tense up . If ever there was a time to suspect that someone at , say , the roulette table had an odds-calculating supercomputer hidden in his shoe , this is it . <P> That said , shoe-size supercomputers were the only data-crunching gadgets I did not see at Comdex last week . Plenty of ultrathin , superlight laptops were on exhibit though  --  the industry 's response to the critical acclaim that met Sony 's launch of the under-3-lb . Vaio earlier this year . While Sony has just introduced an even newer model , the Vaio 505FX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Toshiba 's Portege 3010CT . The Portege weighs 2.9 lbs . and still packs a 10.4-in. active-matrix color screen , a 4.3-gigabyte hard disk and a 56K modem into its 3/4-in. - thick box . Both machines have 266-MHz Pentium chips and 90%-size keyboards , and both are in the $2,000 price range . The Sony is $100 cheaper , but I prefer the Toshiba because it has what I think of as a belly-button-style pointing device , as opposed to Sony 's touch pad . ( Touch pads do not respond well to my hands , which get hot and sweaty when I work . ) Better still , Toshiba claims its machine will run four hours on one battery . <P> The most-fun software I saw came from a small Madison , Wis. , shop called Sonic Foundry . Sonic 's new line of sound-editing programs lets you create amazing music , even if you have a tin ear . I tried Sonic 's Acid Rock ( $49.95 ) , which comes with more than 500 sound clips . You can listen to any clip by simply selecting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it onto a track in the editing room . Lay down a bass line , add percussion and instrumentation  --  the software will even resolve the key so that everything harmonizes . What 's new and astounding here is that everything is rendered in real time : raise the pitch or lower it , speed up or slow down the beat while staying in key . Anything you do can be heard immediately . Not like the old days , when computer musicians had to wait for their compositions to be compiled and processed . Similarly , Play Inc. ' s Amorphium ( $149.95 ) , which will ship next month , allows people to create sophisticated 3-D images . The company is best known for the special animation effects used in Jurassic Park and Terminator 2 . Now you can animate , create special effects and do real-time morphing just like the pros . <P> All this manipulating of multimedia can really chew up one 's hard drive , and , not surprisingly , plenty of companies are offering ever more capacious , ever cheaper ways to store your digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive , which holds 2.2-gigabyte disks ( $29 ) . In January , Castlewood Systems Inc. will start shipping the first external Orb drives ( $199 ) . According to Syed Iftikar , the company 's president , by this time next year , 5-gigabyte disks will be available . No word yet on a shoe-size supercomputer . <P> For more on Comdex see our website at
