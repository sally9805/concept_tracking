Editor 's note : " Food for Scandal : How the New York Times Got Whitewater Wrong " ( October 1994 ) , by Gene Lyons , prompted a spirited response by readers and became the basis of a forum held at the National Press Club in Washington , D.C. , and broadcast on C-Span . The following letter was sent by Joseph Lelyveld , the executive editor of the New York Times , to a Times reader , who then sent a copy to the editors of Harper 's Magazine . With the permission of the New York Times , we have reprinted the letter below . We too have read the Gene Lyons story in Harper 's Magazine and seen the forum on C-Span , and I have to tell you that our faith in Jeff Gerth , our reporter , and our coverage of the Whitewater affair has not been shaken in the least . The Lyons article is full of egregious misrepresentations of our coverage , not to mention our intent . It is wild and shoddy journalism , and I am sorry you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the basic facts of our coverage . It did not turn on a suggestion that the Clintons did something illegal . It turned on two facts : that the Clintons put up much less than half the initial investment in Whitewater but nevertheless got half the ownership ; and that the then governor 's partner subsequently managed a failing savings and loan institution that was subject to state supervision by a banking commissioner the governor appointed . Nothing in Lyons 's article undercuts either of those statements . We also noted that Mrs. Clinton did legal work for the bank while her husband was governor , also a fact that Lyons does n't challenge . The central question we raised about this state of affairs was whether it was appropriate for a governor to be involved in a business deal with the owner of a business regulated by the state . On Mrs. Clinton 's amazingly successful investment in cattle futures , we again never suggested that she did something illegal . We simply reported the existence of the deal , something the Clintons had never disclosed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the chief lawyer for the biggest agribusiness company in the state . There you have the gist of the two major stories we broke . We have no great passion for these old Arkansas tales . We did not think they should shake the foundations of the republic . And , of course , we would much rather devote our reporting efforts to current issues confronting the country . But it was clear to us that these were stories that had to be reported and then not suppressed . They had to be reported , we felt , because these were highly unusual investments that the Clintons had never disclosed and , indeed , had gone to considerable lengths to conceal . For me as an editor the basic test of fairness was this : Would we have printed these stories if the name had been Phil Gramm or Ed Meese rather than Bill Clinton ? It was clear to me that we would have felt obliged to do so . Lyons gets a lot very wrong in his article : He says the banking commissioner , Ms. Schaffer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the law ; he is wrong . It was her obligation to act . He says that a report by federal bank examiners on Madison in 1984 was no evidence that the bank was insolvent because it was not formally an audit but only prepared for supervisory purposes . He apparently does n't know what bank examiners do . What they do is supervise , and what they concluded in this case was that Madison was in trouble . He says that our reporter relied on a man named Sheffield Nelson . He refers to a transcript of a conversation with Jim McDougal the owner of Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan that Nelson released to the press as evidence to back up that assertion . In fact , the transcript was released after our initial Whitewater article appeared , not before , and mainly had to do with the article . So it could not have been the basis for the article . I know the reporting effort that we made on this story and what we got and did n't get from Nelson . What we got , basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can assure you , handed the Times this story . Lyons challenges a statement in our article that Madison was one of the largest state-chartered savings and loan institutions in Arkansas , but to do so , he relies on a list of banking institutions that included federally chartered savings and loan institutions . Again , he apparently does not know the difference . Lyons criticizes an article we published last year for relying on allegations made by David Hale . In fact , although we knew about Hale 's allegations and although we had interviewed him , we deliberately withheld publication of his allegations because we knew he was an unreliable character who was plea-bargaining with the U.S. attorney on another case . We never wrote an article about his allegations , and mentioned them only in passing after they had been reported in detail in other papers . I could go on , but my drift is clear . I am arguing that Lyons 's article was in no sense a careful rebuttal but a scattershot , sloppy polemical assault on the integrity of our reporters and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes much of our editorials . Neither I nor the reporters who worked on these stories had anything to do with our editorials or any other expression of opinion in this paper . We practice a policy of strict separation between the news department and the editorial page . It was never violated in this case , I can assure you . It may be , when the Whitewater affair has finally played itself out , that the country will conclude it did n't amount to much . That will be fine with us . But the basic facts we reported will still remain true  --  the fact that the Clintons had a partnership with the head of a failing savings and loan while Mr. Clinton was governor and the S &L; was under state supervision , and the fact that Mrs. Clinton made all that money in futures . The President , as a candidate , had claimed to have made substantial financial disclosures , but he did not report these facts . We did . Having ascertained them , I still do n't see how we could have done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this length . I hope I have n't tried your patience , but , as you will understand , I can not take lightly attacks on the integrity of this paper . I 'm grateful that you took the trouble to let us know your concerns . Joseph Lelyveld Executive Editor , New York Times New York City <p>
