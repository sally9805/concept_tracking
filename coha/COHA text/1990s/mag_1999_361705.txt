It happened by accident last year that Pine Street Inn , a Boston homeless shelter and job-training center , held its graduation on the same day as Harvard 's . But this year director Erik Payne Butler scheduled his ceremony last Thursday on purpose  --  a reminder , he says , that his graduates should be as celebrated as those folks across the Charles River . And there was an added juxtaposition this year : at Pine Street the keynote speaker was former Labor Secretary Robert Reich ; Harvard welcomed Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan to speak to alums and graduates . The two men have very different views of the economy . In his memoir , Reich imagined that a frank exchange would involve his assailing Greenspan as a " robber-baron pimp " and the central banker 's calling him a " Bolshevik dwarf . " <P> And indeed the day showed both the best of times and the worst of possibilities  --  but not always in the ways you might expect . At Pine Street the yellow and white tent was donated , as were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung over the neighborhood 's old brick buildings . Reich pondered his speech , in which he would remind the recently derelict grads that the great economy is n't trickling down to everyone ; that the vagaries of life  --  and the inevitable economic downturn  --  would try them again . Could n't he be more optimistic on this , their big day ? " I 'm going to try , " he said wanly . <P> But then the 75 graduates marched in . Many wore donated clothes , and proudly . The bodily signs of high off-road mileage  --  sallow skin , dull hair  --  were outshone by the bright glint in their eyes . And Reich was quickly outdone by student speaker Fred McLemore , 34 , whose natty gray suit and mustard bow tie were at odds with his story . He dropped out of school in the eighth grade and became a homeless crack addict . With his last dollar , he came to the shelter two years ago . Now he leaves with an internship-cum-job in computers . " My boss is here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said , to the roar of the crowd . <P> And as they headed out into a new life , the graduates were n't thinking about what might be taken away but what could be got back . Albert Merrill , 55 , a former clerical worker , holds out his 28-day pin and six-month coin , and next month will pass his first year sober . He dreams of the day when he can walk back into the life of his ex-wife and kids . " This is a gift , " he says quietly of his diploma . <P> To a man , they say they 're not jealous of their Harvard counterparts . Indeed , they believe they have an advantage . " I 'm turned around and could be headed toward Harvard , " says reformed crack addict Howard James , 40 . " But one turn for them  --  loss of a job , alcoholism  --  they could be coming to Pine Street . " <P> A 15-minute subway ride away , the lawn in front of Harvard 's Tercentenary Theatre is plush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerome Vered , 41 , an HBO researcher , feels fortunate that he has n't faced " a real curveball , like a spouse or child dying . " Tamara Remy , 24 , a new Harvard Law grad , holds pink flowers and high hopes . " Just today we were wondering if there 's a President among us , " she says of her class .
