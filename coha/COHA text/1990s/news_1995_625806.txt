<p> MENLO PARK , Calif. - Friday 's drop-in workshop at the Shyness Clinic in Menlo Park gets off to an agonizing start . Marcia Hardaway-Burke , who leads the biweekly sessions , asks participants to go around the circle and introduce themselves . <p> The group of five women , two men and one teen-age boy suddenly becomes fixated on their own shoes . One exception is the woman looking at the ceiling , as if she expects a chandelier to fall at any second . <p> After several seconds , Hardaway-Burke breaks the silence and thanks everyone for showing up . " " Shyness is not a curable disease , " she assures the group . " " It is a human experience . " And by being here , in a fellowship of outcasts , they have escaped their " " internal prison of shyness " for one night . It 's a big step : They could have stayed in the car . They could have stayed home . They could have embraced the alternatives so abundant in this digital age . <p> Automation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spared : They can avoid phone operators with credit cards , office small-talk with e-mail , bank tellers with ATMs . <p> While automation has brought convenience , it has also bolstered their cocoons , swelled their ranks . <p> " " These are great days for shy people , " says Stanford psychology professor Philip Zimbardo , the author of several books and articles on the subject , and founder and co-director of the Shyness Clinic and Shyness Institutes in Menlo Park and Portola Valley , Calif . " " Person-to-person contact is being supplanted every day . If a person has any tendency toward shyness , these developments will draw them out . " <p> Techno recluse <p> Likewise , the techno-recluse population of Silicon Valley makes it a region prone to shyness , says Christopher Harkness , a Menlo Park psychologist who helped lead Friday 's group with Hardaway-Burke . " " We had a man at the workshop two weeks ago who could converse only in computer-speak , " Harkness says . " " He just sat there with his eyes closed . " Each major technological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the personal computer - brings speculation on how it will shape human behavior . But a survey published recently by Bernardo J.Carducci , an Indiana University Southeast psychologist , quantifies the discussion . <p> Forty-eight percent of respondents considered themselves shy , roughly an eight-point jump from surveys Zimbardo conducted from 1972 to 1982 . All of which has made shyness a popular new lens through which to view social evolution . <p> Since the Carducci study was published in the November-December issue of Psychology Today , Zimbardo has become a media darling - a role he became accustomed to in 1971 when he became internationally famous for his landmark prison simulation experiments at Stanford . As he speaks , Zimbardo mines a two-day pile of phone messages at his desk on the second floor of the university 's Jordan Hall . <p> Shyness Clinic <p> He has gathered years of unsolicited case studies . It began when Zimbardo first published the results of his shyness studies 20 years ago . The article inspired more letters to the editor than anything the magazine had published before . It preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What It Is , What to Do About It " ( Addison-Wesley ) , now in its sixth printing with editions in 10 languages . He founded the Shyness Clinic at Stanford that same year ; the operation moved off-campus in 1982 . <p> " " I am not shy , " declares the hyper-animated Zimbardo ( he is the founder of Shyness Clinic ; he is not a member ) . But no one is more acutely attuned to the scope and effects of shyness . <p> Even those who do n't call themselves " " shy people " admit to having felt shy in certain situations - during public speeches or blind dates , for instance . Only 5 percent of respondents to Zimbardo 's surveys claim never to be shy . <p> Still , shyness has existed in obscurity as a psychological notion . The word " " shy " rarely appears in psychological texts , Zimbardo says . It 's generally viewed in the context of broader personality profiles . " " Shyness is treated as a temporary phenomenon , " Zimbardo says . Therapists will recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've heard everything . I 've heard from little kids ; I 've heard from old people . I once got a letter from an 87-year-old grandmother who said her fondest wish was to spend one day not being shy before she died . It was extremely sad . " But with the sad stories come triumphant ones . <p> Rick Bragg , a 43-year-old supervisor at the TCI warehouse in Sunnyvale , Calif. , calls himself a recovered shy person . " " I would almost call myself outgoing now , " Braggs says . He describes his former life as a series of unreturned phone calls , unseized opportunities and unattended company picnics . <p> " " I always made sure I worked graveyard , swing or weekend shifts so I could minimize my social contact , " Bragg says . It was an entrenched pattern of avoidance he has followed throughout his life . Bragg would stay home from school when he was scheduled to give oral presentations . He would walk blocks out of his way to avoid girls . He abused alcohol to lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly for a failed marriage . <p> Bragg learned of the Shyness Clinic from his private therapist , Dr. Lynne Henderson , the program 's co-director . He attended group sessions at the clinic each Saturday from January to July of this year at a cost of $ 60 a week . <p> ( Individual therapy sessions cost $ 110 . ) <p> Role play <p> In the meetings , Bragg was encouraged to speak freely about his shyness , " " role play " anxiety-provoking situations in the group , and complete " " homework " assignments ( make one phone call , ask a co-worker to lunch ) . The meetings did wonders for him , Bragg says , calling the experience " " the most valuable thing I have ever done . " He attended his first company picnic this summer . <p> The Shyness Clinic follows " " a social fitness model , not a medical model which implies a cure , " says Henderson from her office in Portola Valley . There are rolling hills out the window and subdued pastoral art on the wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waiting room : the " " Hell-Raiser " headline on the recent Time magazine cover photo of Pat Buchanan ) . <p> We live in an era in which behavior is shaped so much by smooth media personalities , Henderson says . Such seemingly perfect " " social athletes " as Barbara Walters and Johnny Carson set an unfair standard of social ease ( in fact , Carson and Walters are notoriously self-conscious off-screen ; Zimbardo calls them " " shy extroverts " in his book ) . " " If people come in here expecting to be perfect social performers , we say ' go to acting school , ' " says Henderson . " " A lot of shy people expect to act like entertainers . They focus more on performance , but where does the human being come in ? <p> We encourage people to bumble freely in here . " <p> And they are encouraged to achieve simple goals as a means to a productive social end . Bragg says he wishes he had become " " outgoing " earlier in his life . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I missed out on , " he says . He also realizes that , like a former substance abuser , a shy person is never " " recovered . " It takes daily initiative . <p> Day-to-day struggles <p> He still struggles in certain areas , such as phone calls . <p> Henderson asked him to call the San Jose Mercury News for this story on a Wednesday . She informed him the deadline was Friday . He called late Friday afternoon . " " Yeah , I kept putting it off , " Bragg says . " " It was tough for me . But at least I called . " <p> A few hours later , eight new participants will attend the Friday drop-in clinic in Menlo Park . It 's a free , 90-minute session in which Hardaway-Burke and Harkness outline the six-month program , practice some techniques and discuss shyness . <p> It seems the sputtering start is a harbinger . Barely anyone speaks . Harkness will later describe this as " " an unusually avoidant group . " But again , at least they 're here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone on " " being really good about making eye contact . " <p> Small victories , the stuff of big progress
