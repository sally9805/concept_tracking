Section : Science &; society , Cover story E. O. Wilson argues that species extinction threatens human spirit <p> Sweat plastering the shirt to his back , the man hurries through a ruined pasture . After searching all day , he is exultant to have finally found a remnant patch of rain forest . Entering the grove , he scans several araucaria pines for familiar insects . But instead of the teeming communities of tiger beetles and ants he expects to find , he spies only a few stray ants . Dropping to his knees , he pulls out a magnifying glass and riffles anxiously through the leaf litter . Calm down , he tells himself : They ca n't all have disappeared . Then suddenly he senses that the light filtering through the canopy is far too bright , and looking around he sees only fields . The trees are just a windbreak . The rain forest has vanished like a mirage . <p> This recurring dream always leaves E. O. Wilson with a terrible sense of urgency . Floating to consciousness , he worries , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor , controversial father of sociobiology and international authority on ants , Ed Wilson already knows where his skills lie , and he is all too familiar with the difficulties of juggling competing demands on his time . But now the stakes are higher , his early-morning worries more intense : With the publication of his new book , The Diversity of Life ' ( Harvard University Press ) , he has sounded a poignant and powerful alarm over species loss and has reluctantly assumed the demanding role of defender of the planet 's endangered plants and animals . This is a make-or-break decade , ' says the modern-day Darwin . Humanity 's future is in the balance . ' <p> Spiritual erosion . Indeed , all other environmental problems pale beside the ongoing extinction crisis . In the next three decades , fully a fifth of the Earth 's species could vanish forever . Yet currently , little is being done to preserve our rich natural heritage . Wilson hopes to change that . He argues passionately that the hemorrhaging of biological wealth not only destabilizes ecosystems and squanders priceless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  most frightening to Wilson  --  eats away at the human soul . Human beings , he contends , have a natural affinity and reverence for living things , attachments that are not simply inculcated by culture but deeply ingrained in basic genetic makeup . If we let too many species go , ' he warns , we face an enormous psychological and spiritual loss . ' <p> This grand yet sobering world view had its origins for Wilson in something humblingly small : the ant . As the bespectacled , unassuming professor readily acknowledges , he is first and foremost an ant man , or myrmecologist . Three colonies of leaf-cutter ants in plastic tubs dominate his office at Harvard 's Museum of Comparative Zoology . He has discovered ( or , in the parlance of taxonomists , described ' ' ) some 300 species , and with entomologist Bert Holldobler , he has written the definitive volume on the creatures , The Ants , ' winner of the 1991 Pulitzer prize in general nonfiction . ( He also won a Pulitzer in 1979 for his book On Human Nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the biological roots of social behavior . As a young instructor at Harvard in the late 1950s , he was the first to detail the way ants communicate with chemicals . He removed the tiny Dufour 's gland from the abdomen of a fire ant and crushed it against a glass plate near a captive colony . He was astounded to see ants boil out of the nest and follow the chemical trail across the glass . He went on to discover that a variety of social behaviors are controlled by chemicals , including necrophoric ' substances that , when painted on live ants , prompted workers to cart the protesting corpses ' off to a refuse pile . <p> In the 1950s and 1960s , Wilson traveled widely throughout the Pacific collecting and observing ants . He often ventured into remote regions like New Guinea 's Huon Peninsula , an enchanted world , he recalls , of interlocking trunks and branches blanketed by a thick layer of moss , orchids and other epiphytes that ran unbroken off the tree trunks and across the ground . ' The forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exciting scientifically . But it also was nourishing spiritually : It was like entering heaven ; I could expand my soul indefinitely . ' <p> Evolutionary insight . The jewel of the forest was the resplendent bird of paradise , but Wilson confesses that he never saw one because his eyes usually were trained on the complex insect kingdom at his feet . Increasingly , he was captivated by insect societies and the parallels he saw between them and vertebrate societies . Consider termites and monkeys , he later wrote : Both live in cooperative groups that defend territories . Group members communicate hunger , hostility , rank and reproductive status through as many as 100 sounds , gestures and chemical signals , and in both societies there is a well-marked division of labor . He became convinced that it was not just lower animals with small brains whose social behavior was genetically programmed ; it appeared that behavior in a wide range of species was shaped by eons of genetic evolution in much the same manner as physical traits are formed . It made perfect sense from an evolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species would be most likely to pass on their genes to offspring . <p> In 1975 , Wilson advanced these ideas in a groundbreaking book , Sociobiology : The New Synthesis . ' For the most part , he analyzed the social behavior of nonhuman animals , from social ranking of lemurs and lions to territorial displays of lizards . But in the final chapter he broadened his theory to encompass people , postulating a genetic component to aggression and warfare , territoriality and the division of labor between the sexes , among other social traits . <p> The book ignited a firestorm . Though it generally received favorable reviews in scientific journals , some academics accused Wilson of providing a genetic justification for a raft of social ills , including racism and sexism . He tried to reassure his critics , explaining that in humans only a small fraction of behavior is genetic and that most is shaped by cultural forces . But the attacks continued , reaching a fever pitch in the 1978 annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science . The hotel was packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson 's turn to speak , a dozen people stormed the stage , screaming Nazi ! ' and racist ! ' One of the hecklers , yelling You 're all wet , ' dumped a carafe of ice water on Wilson 's head . <p> Ultimately , Wilson won the National Medal of Science for his scholarship in the field , and he maintains that the sociobiology wars had little lasting impact on him personally . Even so , he concedes that he feels safer as a person ' out of the public eye . <p> Indeed , he feels safest in the woods , especially subtropical forests like those he explored growing up in the Florida panhandle and southern Alabama . For Wilson , the natural world salved the loneliness of a childhood filled with wrenching separations and loss . His parents divorced when he was 7 , and his mother moved away to Kentucky . His father , Edward Sr. , jumped from one job to another , and as a result , Ed Jr. , an only child , attended 16 schools in 11 years , skipping a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chaotic home life , the natural world was reassuringly constant . No matter where his family moved , within a day or two Ed Jr . would be out exploring nearby swamps and forests , butterfly net or snake handler 's stick in hand . And there , amid the dense patches of cabbage palmetto , carolina parakeets , ivory-billed woodpeckers and diamondback rattlers , he found companionship and a sense of community . Even on excursions into the field today , he finds he derives real joy from seeing a familiar creature , especially if he has n't encountered it for a while : I actually find myself saying silently , Hello , little friend , ' or Bingo , am I glad to see you . ' ' <p> Given this background , it 's not surprising that Wilson has mixed feelings about assuming a more public role as a bard of biodiversity . But he feels he has no choice . Species are slipping into extinction at a stunning rate . The main culprit is habitat destruction . At least half of the world 's species  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are being destroyed at a rate of 42 million acres a year . Wilson estimates that in these forests alone 27,000 species vanish each year . Pollution and the introduction of exotic species  --  which crowd out native plants and animals  --  are also to blame . In recent decades , populations of migratory songbirds in the mid-Atlantic United States have dropped 50 percent . About a fifth of the world 's freshwater-fish species are extinct or seriously threatened . Fungi , many of which aid the absorption of nutrients by plants , are on the verge of mass extinction in Western Europe ; frogs and other amphibians are declining throughout the world . <p> And these are just the species known to science . The planet 's biological storehouse is so unexplored that researchers ca n't even say for sure how many species exist : The total could be 10 million or as many as 100 million , says Wilson . Marvelous diversity dwells in the most unexpected places . The plumage of a bird , for instance , can harbor dozens of species of feather mites , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a primary wing feather . The cold , dark depths of the ocean support armies of worms , crustaceans and mollusks . Insects are the most diverse of the 1.4 million species that have been described thus far . Yet their diversity is dwarfed by the wealth of species in the microscopic world of bacteria . It is estimated that a pinch of ordinary soil contains 4,000 to 5,000 species of bacteria . <p> Given such abundance , some skeptics maintain that a few million species could slip safely into extinction . But whenever a species dies , Wilson argues , a treasure trove of biological information encoded in its genes vanishes , too . All living species are survivors , shaped and honed by billions of acts of natural selection . All are very good at something , whether it is fighting bacterial pests or manufacturing oils , and in destroying them we block the development of a host of potential medicines , crops , petroleum substitutes and fibers . <p> Tropical pharmacy . Despite limited research , dozens of species already have yielded vital medicines . A drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was derived from the saliva of the vampire annelid worm . Fully one fourth of all prescriptions filled by pharmacies each year are for substances derived from plants , and when drugs from microorganisms and animals are added in , the total jumps to 40 percent . Wild plants also have helped researchers vanquish countless agricultural pests . Just last month , scientists in Mexico scored a victory against leaf rust , a wheat blight , by crossing domesticated wheat strains with rust-resistant varieties found in Brazil . <p> An even more vital reason to protect biodiversity , Wilson argues , is to preserve the ecosystems that we depend on to enrich the soil , modify the climate , even create the air we breathe . Turning over a stump on a walk recently near his home in Lexington , Mass. , he pointed out a profusion of small and obscure life forms , organisms that hold the world steady '  --  a metallic blue beetle , a centipede , mites , a crane fly , slugs galore and a riot of orange , white and yellow fungi , topped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrix , Wilson says , our tenure on Earth would be nasty and brief . ' <p> In what he calls a traitorous digression , ' Wilson acknowledges that most ecosystems probably could lose a hefty fraction of their species and still function , at least in the short term . Though some species play essential roles  --  beavers ' dam building , for example , creates pond ecosystems that are much different from free-running streams  --  most do not , so their extinction probably would have little practical effect on the rest of the system . <p> But loss of diversity has an insidious consequence , he argues . Ecosystems with fewer species tend to be less stable in the long term , and in the event of global climate change , diversity will help determine which ecosystems collapse and which flourish , Wilson believes . Fossil evidence suggests that the ponderosa pine , now prevalent throughout America 's Rocky Mountain forests , was a marginal species at the end of the last ice age . Similarly , some of today 's rare and apparently insignificant species may be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next century . <p> Yet for Wilson , the most compelling reason to fight for every scrap of biodiversity has more to do with humanity 's emotional health . In his new book , he writes , Signals abound that the loss of life 's diversity endangers not just the body but the spirit . If that much is true , the changes occurring now will visit harm on all generations to come . ' On the face of it , a spiritual argument seems a stretch for a scientist whose roots are in evolution and entomology . But in fact , it is a logical outgrowth of his lifelong study of the biological bases of behavior . Wilson contends that human beings inherit a tendency to feel an affinity and awe for living things , the same way we are predisposed to be territorial or protect our young at all costs . And when we destroy the natural world we court spiritual disaster . ' <p> Natural affinities . According to Wilson , this biophilic response is fundamental and complex . How could it be otherwise ? he asks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about 2 million years , from the time of Homo habilis to the late Stone Age of Homo sapiens , during which people existed in hunter-gatherer bands in intimate contact with the natural environment . Snakes mattered . The smell of water , the hum of a bee , the directional bend of a plant stalk mattered . The naturalist 's trance was adaptive ; the glimpse of one small animal hidden in the grass could make the difference between eating and going hungry in the evening . ' <p> Indeed , recent research supports Wilson 's notion of a genetic spirituality ( box , right ) . Biophilia may well explain why individuals fill their homes with plants and pets and are instinctively drawn to certain landscapes . It may explain why humans are reassured by the thought of untrammeled wilderness and outraged when it is despoiled . <p> Wilson contends that until we better understand the depth and complexity of nature 's hold on the human spirit , continuing to raze habitat is extraordinarily risky . Right now , it is mostly field biologists who dream at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passing of much-loved plant and animal species . But in time , as the casualties mount , many more may find themselves grief-stricken . The loss of biodiversity , Wilson believes , is the folly our descendants are least likely to forgive us .
