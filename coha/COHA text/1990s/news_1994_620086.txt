<p> ' THE FED FAT CATS ' WAR ON THE WORKERS ' <p> Editor  --  Interesting how our economic system works ? Refer to James Risen 's report on the Fed , and your August 30 editorial , " Encouraging Unemployment . " <p> Daily in our newspapers the power elite castigate the unemployed , powerless people about what low-lifes they are to be on welfare , unemployment insurance or whatever . The verbal and actual assault on the poor by the likes of Bill Clinton and Pete Wilson condemning the poor for being poor . <p> And then we read that the fat cats at the Fed , Alan Greenspan , Robert Parry and others of their ilk , think the unemployment rate is too low at 6.1 to 6.5 percent . They refer to this rate as " the natural rate of unemployment . " What the hell is natural about manipulation of the prime rate to keep unemployment high and maintain a large pool of labor to be exploited at the lowest wage possible ? <p> One of the most disgusting aspects of these actions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get hurt no matter what the economic situation , is their complete indifference to the consequences . They could care less that people are thrown out on the street and lose everything . <p> It does n't take a Rhodes scholar to know that if the unemployment rate is deliberately ( and we know it is ) kept at 6.1 percent or a little higher , there are a hell of a lot of people out of work and unable to pay taxes . So what are we to do with these unemployed ? The answer coming from more than a few of the fat cats is to declare them criminals and lock them up . What great humanitarians they are . <p> WILLIAM D. COOPER <p> Concord <p> TERRORISM IN THE HOME <p> Editor  --  This is to D.B. Fyfe , who claimed in the September 1 letters to the editor that laws since the 1700s have prohibited wife beating , and criticized " dogmatic feminists " for promulgating " noble lies " about the victimization of women . <p> I have taught domestic violence law at Boalt Hall Law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cases in the reader I compiled is Bradley v. State ( 1824 , Miss. ) , typical of its time : " Let the husband be permitted to exercise the right of moderate chastisement . . . and use salutary restraints in every case of misbehavior , without being subjected to vexatious prosecutions , resulting in the discredit and shame of all parties concerned . " Half a century later , in State v. Oliver ( No . Carolina , 1874 ) , another state supreme court stated : " If no permanent injury has been inflicted , nor malice , cruelty nor dangerous violence shown by the husband , it is better to draw the curtain , shut out the public gaze , and leave the parties to forget and forgive . " Unfortunately , the same attitudes often prevail today . <p> It is time to stop quibbling over statistics about domestic violence , and face the fact that we as a society have too long condoned this often fatal terrorism in the home . Instead of arguing about when it became technically illegal to beat one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop this heinous practice . <p> NANCY K.D. LEMON , Esq . <p> California Alliance <p> Against Domestic Violence <p> Berkeley <p> DESERT BILL UNDERMINED ? <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle told it like it is in its editorial , " Desert Bill Faces Last-Ditch Attack , " September 10 . After using every possible parliamentary trick to try and derail the California Desert Protec tion Act , the final chapter of the bill 's tortuous legislative path is now being played out behind closed doors in Congress . This latest election-year assault on the desert bill by a handful of congressmen and senators threatens to undermine final enactment of the bill and thereby the ecological and economic future of the California desert . <p> Beyond the constant efforts of the minority party to govern by gridlock and deep-six the bill , another threat to it is the year-end habit of members of Congress to festoon bills headed to the president 's desk with extraneous legislative adornments that greatly complicate the final steps a bill must take before becoming law . For example , surely , it is cynical beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the bill 's alleged and overstated costs , have added on a provision mandating $ 600 million in new federal spending . <p> It is time to play hardball . As the 103rd Congress moves toward adjournment , Senator Dianne Feinstein and Representative George Miller must renew the skillful leadership they so ably exhibited in securing House and Senate passage of strong versions of the desert bill . Their getting a strong desert bill to the president would be a magnificent accomplishment  --  a gift to California and to all who care about the American landscape and all it represents . <p> JAY THOMAS WATSON <p> Regional Director <p> The Wilderness Society <p> San Francisco <p> ' MOTOR VOTER ' ENCROACHES <p> Editor  --  I for one support Governor Wilson 's refusal to implement the federal " motor voter " law ( Chronicle , " Wilson Assailed on ' Motor Voter ' Rejection , " September 7 ) . I 'll admit that I am not an expert on constitutional law , but my gut feeling is that the federal government can not order a state to comply with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the framers of the Constitution that state and local governments serve as administrative arms of the federal government . The federal government can set voter qualifications for federal elections , but certainly can not order the California DMV to register its voters . As a case in point , a federal judge in Montana recently held portions of the Brady gun law unconstitutional because it required state and local governments to run background checks of pistol buyers during the 10-day waiting period . Its good intentions notwithstanding , the federal " motor voter " law is an encroachment into the state 's sovereignty , and Governor Wilson is to be commended for refusing to knuckle under . <p> RICHARD S. SHAWKEY <p> Livermore <p> DOMESTIC PARTNERS ' VETO <p> Editor  --  Governor Wilson 's veto of the domestic partner registration bill calls to mind a parallel with a development in the history of international partnerships , between the U.S. and England just before the outbreak of World War II . <p> The argument that " we need to strengthen , not weaken , the institution of marriage " was phrased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue against giving material assistance that England could not pay back through traditional loan agreements . The White House turned that argument around to show that broadening the rules by creative lending could save an alliance whose failure would bring everyone down . <p> The conservative argument against the vetoed bill is actually the best argument in favor of it . <p> RON ERICKSON <p> Menlo Park <p> NATIONAL FIRE POLICY <p> Editor  --  Kathleen Duysen 's letter , " Blame Fires on P.C. " ( Chronicle , September 9 ) , attempts to blame recent wildfires on the " trendy preservation movement . " This is a half truth , at best . <p> The national fire policy does not ignore the fact that fire can only be postponed , not prevented . The fuel load is a result of the old policy of fire suppression that has been practiced for the last 100 years . It can not be blamed on recent " environmentalism . " The current policy allows lightning-caused fires to burn , if no structures are threatened . It is not " politically incorrect " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and debris like the Native Americans once did . If Ms. Duysen really knew the policy , she would know that fires are set on a regular basis to " reverse the buildup " and prevent catastrophic wildfires . <p> The misguided information put forth by the California Women in Timber will result in clear-cut logging that will destroy an ecosystem and choke trout and salmon streams . There wo n't be a fire because there wo n't be any trees . <p> NORMAN BONE <p> Yosemite <p> CORRECTION <p> EDItor  --  Re Ralph Georgy article in September 8 Opinion page : <p> Please print a correction of Mr. Georgy 's credentials , because he is misrepresenting himself to you . He was an undergraduate student with a philosophy major who last attended in fall 1993 and does not have any degrees from UCLA . He has never applied for nor been admitted to the doctoral program in philosophy at UCLA . <p> KRISTIN CARNOHAN <p> Student Affairs Officer <p> Department of Philosophy , UCLA <p> Los Angeles <p> THE END OF BASEBALL <p> Editor  --  Baseball 's wealthy Neanderthals have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another game . I do n't care if there are thrill-packed pennant chases , booming home runs , and days in the brilliant sunshine ahead , I refuse to enjoy any of it . It 's important that the Neanderthals be taught a lesson . <p> I 'm going to stay home and cut off my nose instead . <p> RICK LEMYRE <p> Brentwood ( Contra Costa County )
