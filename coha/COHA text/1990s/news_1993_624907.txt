<p> Basketball legends usually are big , strong , skyscraper kind of men . They play in America 's biggest cities and live in a speeded-up world of fat contracts , fast cars and fabulous women . <p> Then there is Sheryl Swoopes , who breaks the mold . <p> Swoopes is the girl/woman star forward who rose from the plains of West Texas to national prominence last spring . She 's a willowy 22-year-old who favors red nail polish and hair bows . She does not look like a skyscraper , she is not especially muscular and she does n't cuss or even raise her voice . <p> What she does do is play relentlessly , like a sand storm picking up speed . If opponents are taller and bigger than she is , she 's faster . If they 're shorter , she just shoots over them . <p> Millions of Americans watched her in April as she led the Texas Tech University Lady Raiders to the school 's first national championship . The rest of the team played superbly , too , but when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Male fans paid her their ultimate compliment  --  they said she plays just like a man , even better than they do . <p> During that last game in the Final Four , Swoopes scored a record 47 points against Ohio State and broke or tied eight other NCAA Tournament records for women 's basketball . <p> After the buzzer , Swoopes looked so dazed that a friend came up and pinched her . Thanks , Swoopes thought . She saw reporters jostling for interviews , fans begging for her autograph , Atlanta 's Omni Arena awash in red and white , and she was afraid she was dreaming . <p> Talk about misplaced worries . Her real problem was that her new-found fame was about to destroy her old way of life . Good-bye , girlhood ; hello , trouble . <p> The day after the historic game , Swoopes and her teammates flew home to Lubbock . They were met at the airport by limousines and driven straight to Tech 's Jones Stadium . There , 40,000 Lady Raiders fans , many of whom had already celebrated by swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out their love and devotion . The rally was heaven , but afterward Swoopes was ready to get back to normal . <p> It was n't to be . She found she could hardly step out of her apartment without being stalked by autograph seekers . <p> The Wednesday after the Sunday game , she put on a cap , sunglasses and a coat and went out around midnight to attempt 10 minutes of grocery shopping . She walked into an almost empty store . <p> Two hours later the store was full of well-wishers , and she still was signing her name to scraps of paper , tennis shoes , purses . <p> Things have calmed down a bit since then , but Swoopes and her boyfriend , Eric Jackson , still draw crowds if they venture out to the shopping mall , their favorite Chinese and Mexican restaurants or their favorite video arcade . <p> " " If I 'm in a bad mood , I just stay home , " Swoopes says . <p> " " I do n't want people to think I 'm rude . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that girl , and she was really great . ' " <p> Swoopes was born in Brownfield , a windswept , neglected-looking town of 10,000 about 40 miles southwest of Lubbock . <p> " " There 's nothing to do in Brownfield , " Swoopes says under her breath . " " And everybody knows everybody else 's business . " <p> Sheryl is the third of four children and the only girl born to Louise Swoopes , still a loyal Brownfieldian . To Sheryl and her brothers , their mama is " " it , " the direct object of much of their love and affection . <p> If Sheryl gets just some of the money that 's been discussed in the past few months , she plans to build her mom a house . <p> Your kids are wild about you , a reporter tells Louise . <p> " " Really ? " Louise asks . She 's so modest she seems genuinely surprised and pleased . <p> Sheryl 's dad does n't hold that exalted position in the hearts of his offspring . He left the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't remember what he looks like . She 'll never forget , however , how her mom scraped and sweated through menial jobs to support her family , and how her eldest brother , James , filled the role of brother , father and coach . <p> James , with assists from middle brother , Earl , assumed responsibility for Sheryl 's basketball education . As early as age 7 , she signed up to play for Brownfield 's Little Dribblers , the basketball equivalent of Little League . <p> Sheryl tells people that she is not a natural talent , that practice with her brothers got her where she is today , but her mother demurs . Almost as long as Louise Swoopes can remember , she 's been sitting in gyms watching her daughter whip the competition . <p> Sheryl has never been brutal on the court , or even mean . What sets Sheryl apart , Louise says , is the message in her eyes . She is determined to win . <p> Lady Raiders basketball coach Marsha Sharp can read Sheryl 's eyes , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabs on Sheryl when she was only a pip-squeak ninth-grader . Even then , Sharp hoped that down the road she could interest Sheryl in Tech . <p> As a junior in high school , Sheryl led her Brownfield team to the Class 3A state championship . As a senior , she was named to three different All-American teams and averaged a sizzling 26 points , 5 assists and 14 rebounds per game . <p> Sheryl might have figured that nobody was watching . <p> Brownfield , after all , is little more than a bend in the road . <p> Lubbock , best known for Buddy Holly , prairie dogs and a big sky , is commonly ignored by the rest of the country . <p> So the Swoopes family was amazed when , just as it was time for Sheryl to pick a college , she was bombarded with scholarship offers from schools all over America . <p> Sheryl was surprised but dismayed , too . She could barely deal with the thought of leaving her mom and growing up and away . <p> It was too much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . <p> Maybe Sheryl did n't settle on the best way to make a decision , but it was the quickest . Instead of consulting her usual panel of experts  --  her mother , brothers and coaches  --  she checked with a few pals at school . When they told her the University of Texas at Austin was the only place in the universe where she could make a name for herself in basketball , she signed . <p> In the fall of ' 89 , Sheryl spent a total of one week on the UT campus . She was so dreadfully homesick that she hated to get off the phone from her mom . She could n't even eat . <p> " " Goodbye , " she told her UT coach , Jody Conradt . " " I 'm going home for the weekend . " <p> Conradt , alarmed but not yet panicked , took a page out of Sheryl 's book and started dialing 806 , the Brownfield area code . <p> " " Mrs. Swoopes , " she pleaded , " " talk to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time talking that weekend , but the conversations were n't going as the coach had hoped . Louise supported her daughter if she wanted to go to UT , but if she did n't , by all means , come on home . <p> Sheryl called Lyndon Hardin , the women 's basketball coach at South Plains ( Junior ) College in Levelland , just 28 miles from Brownfield . <p> " " This is Sheryl Swoopes , " she said . <p> " " Who ? " he said . " " Is this a joke ? " <p> Sheryl told Hardin that she wanted to play at South Plains . <p> In the publicity pictures taken when she joined the South Plains Lady Texans , she looks confident , calm , happy . Her new coach looks as if he 's just won the lottery . <p> Sheryl had two excellent seasons in Levelland , so good that when it came time for her to transfer to a four-year college , she was rushed by recruiters again . But most did n't have their hearts in it . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said she wanted to stay close to home . <p> By the fall of ' 91 , coach Sharp had convinced her that the best way to stay in the neighborhood and play top-flight basketball was to try Texas Tech . <p> In her junior year at Tech , Sheryl was named Kodak All-American and Sports Illustrated Player of the Week . Her senior year she won Kodak All-American , and Sports Illustrated and USA Today honored her as National Player of the Year . Everything was eclipsed , however , by the thrill of winning the Final Four . In the last few minutes of that last game , Sharp hugged every Lady Raider , Sheryl last and longest of all . <p> Like Sheryl , Sharp is a West Texan born and bred , family-oriented , and way smart enough to know there 's more to life than winning , or even basketball . But Sharp just shakes her head when she remembers how sweet it really was to reach a lifelong goal with that particular team . <p> " " They were great kids  --  they took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know not one of those players was in my office for discipline problems the whole year ? " <p> A few days after Sharp got home from Atlanta last spring , she started making plans for next year 's varsity team . Once again , she says , she 's got a great group of kids . " " But I could n't replace Sheryl , " she says ruefully . " " There 's nothing real good I can say about her graduating . " <p> Sharp is 40 , and she 's been coaching and studying women 's basketball for the past 20 years . " " Sheryl , " she says , " " is a legend in the game  --  the best I 've ever seen . And coaching her was the most incredible experience I 've ever had . " <p> Sheryl is pacing around the women 's gym at Tech , looking as if she wished she could disappear to a place where reporters and photographers were blades of grass . Or maybe cow-patties . <p> A photographer raises his camera . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already it seems too long . <p> Sheryl is hoping she 'll get the chance to endorse Nike products for significant bucks , but at this writing , she has n't heard . <p> She 's also hoping she 'll be able to land a fat contract to play on a professional women 's basketball team in Europe , but again , she has n't heard . <p> Mostly Sheryl hears from fans and media types , all engaged in the American pastime of building up celebrities to fairy-tale proportions , then knocking them down . <p> Sheryl , a shy , private person , does n't want any part of it . She hates the hoopla . <p> Boyfriend Eric , who has been fluttering around Sheryl in the gym , agrees to talk with a reporter . Maybe it feels good not to be ignored . So many people want to see Sheryl at different events around town , he says , but often they prefer her to come alone . <p> Eric is from Brownfield , too . They met when she was a high school senior and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger than she is . <p> " " We did n't really expect the relationship to be serious , " he says . " " But we got attached . We have so much in common . We both love music  --  country , pop , rap  --  and we like to play softball and ride bikes . She has a lot of patience with kids , and I do too . " <p> Sheryl is circling closer and closer to Eric . She 's 6 feet tall but so slender and graceful she 's just a wisp of the wind . <p> Curiosity is getting the best of her . She bends toward Eric , the better to hear what he 's telling . <p> If Sheryl does get a contract with a European team , Eric is saying , he 'd like to go , too . He 'll be a sophomore at Tech this fall , but that 's OK , he says , he 'll take correspondence courses . <p> " " My dad ? Well , he understands . He says I 'm an adult now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> To escape from people and incessant questions , Eric says he and Sheryl go to the movies or play Nintendo at home or visit their favorite video arcade . Sometimes they spend hours feeding 25-cent tokens into the machines . <p> " " Or we shop , " Eric says , " " and both of us love to eat  - -  we love Mexican and Chinese food . " <p> " " I like nachos , " says Sheryl , making her first public comment of the afternoon . <p> Before long , she is sitting next to the reporter and Eric is circling . <p> Swoopes on Swoopes : Nope , she says , she does n't have quite enough college credits to graduate . Next summer , she will finish up . <p> Yes , she says , graduating is very important . " " My brother , James , did it , and I want to do it . I want my mom to be as proud of me as she was of him . " <p> Yes , she knows her mom is proud of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots of her mom watching the Final Four . " " She had so many expressions on her face . I saw her giving everybody " five ' and slapping people on the head with her pompons . " <p> Sheryl says she feels grateful to have attended Tech , to have played with the Lady Raiders , to have won the string of honors she did . " " Stuff like that just does n't happen to Brownfield girls . I was told that if I left UT I would n't get this and I would n't get that . But I said if I was good enough , it would all work out . <p> " " The other girls on the Lady Raiders were n't jealous , no , " Sheryl says . " " I was thankful to Krista Kirkland  --  she was such a great player , and she should have been a Kodak All-American , too . <p> Sometimes people were so focused on Sheryl Swoopes , they never paid attention to Krista . That girl can shoot . She 's a great , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to coach . " When Sheryl is done with professional sports , she 'd like to be a basketball coach , too . Krista and Sharp will be her role models , she says . " " Coach Sharp was so easygoing  --  just a nice type of person . And she got the job done . " <p> Sheryl recently finished working at Sharp 's basketball camp at Tech . Next , she 'll counsel young players at a summer camp led by Chicago Bulls superstar Michael Jordan . <p> He invited her to a Bulls game earlier in the summer , and they met and talked in the Bulls ' weight room afterward . She 'll never forget it . <p> " " Eric and I were just sitting there , and the players started to come in and I was going , " Wow ! ' Michael Jordan was the last one to come in . I said , " It ca n't be ! ' He said , " Hey , Sheryl , how are you doing ? ' My mouth was wide open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' <p> " " What do you say to Michael Jordan ? " Sheryl asks . <p> " " Anyhow , he talked to us . He was real nice . " <p> It 's one thing to be in awe of Jordan , whom many describe as the best male basketball player the world has ever seen . It 's another , Swoopes says , for people to be in awe of her . <p> " " Strange things happen , " Swoopes says . " " One guy started telling me how much he liked me , how much he loved me . Then he sent me a cassette tape . I threw it away . Sometimes people try to follow me home . They want to be my friend , my relative . They think I 'm making all this money . " <p> Thus far she 's been paid for a summer job at a local bank , coaching basketball at Sharp 's camp and making speeches around town . The folks at the bank helped her finance a red ' 93 Pontiac Grand Am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it herself . Monthly . <p> Sheryl would have jumped at the chance to play basketball here , but there is no professional women 's league in the United States . For Sheryl to make money playing ball , she has to go abroad , probably France , Spain or Italy . No , she says , she is not resentful at the unequal opportunity for men and women basketball players here , nor does she wish she could play on a men 's team . <p> " " They 're men , " she says , as if talking to a nursery school child . " " I 'm a woman . " <p> Men can dunk , Sheryl says , explaining one difference between men 's and women 's basketball . Women , she says , do a better job of communicating with their teammates . " " Men are more concerned with a one-on-one thing . " When she finally lands a European contract , the paycheck will be nice but not the be-all and end-all , she says . Traveling , seeing the world , testing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's really important . <p> She ca n't wait to see Europe . No problem , she says to people who wonder if she can handle nine months a year in a foreign country , when she did n't survive a week at UT . She 's older now and more mature . <p> It does make her sad , she says , that she has to leave her homeland to carry out her dreams . One day , she says , she 'd like to start a professional women 's league here . She does n't want the Little Dribblers of today to face her same dilemma tomorrow . <p> Louise Swoopes is reminiscing in her bedroom . She 's talking there so her youngest child , Brandon , 10 , can watch afternoon TV in the living room . He 's a bit jealous of the fuss made over his older siblings , and she figures she need n't do anything to fan the flames . Brandon is going to play football , he 's told his mom . To heck with basketball . <p> Sheryl is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in four years , and after the first two were boys , she said , " " You know I was glad to see a little girl . She came out this precious little doll . " <p> The boys rigged up a hoop to play basketball in the front yard , and it was n't long before Sheryl was demanding to play , too . <p> Inevitably , she would get knocked down and scrape her knees and come inside crying . <p> " " That would get me all involved , " Louise says , " " but Sheryl would never give up . She 's always been a fighter . " <p> Louise does n't have a car , but she 's done her level best to get to all of her daughter 's games . It 's hard to sit quietly in the stands , she says , when she knows opposing players are trying to rough up her daughter . And it 's terrible when Sheryl gets hurt . <p> Sheryl was trying out for the ' 92 Olympics when she injured her knee badly enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel every ache and pain my children have , " Louise says . " " Sheryl 's knee is fine now , but every game after that , I thought , " Oh , she 's going to hurt it again . ' <p> " " Once she hurt her back , too , " Louise says . " " She went up for a layup and heard something go " pop . ' But she did n't need surgery for that , just some time with the heating pad . " <p> Sheryl 's growing up , sure , her mom says . " " But she does n't get a big head . She 's just Sheryl . She does n't look up to herself . <p> She 's a teammate person . I 've seen players . . . well , I thought with as many awards as Sheryl has got , maybe she 'd change , too , but she has n't . " <p> Sheryl is famous for keeping her emotions in check during games ; her mom struggles mightily to do the same . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and another player knocked Sheryl down and bumped her knee , " Louise says . " " It seemed to me Sheryl was lying on the floor five or six minutes , and she could n't get up . I yelled , " Get her up from there ! ' Later , Sheryl said , " Mom , try not to say anything . ' " <p> Louise does many things well , among them , worrying about Sheryl . She worries about racial prejudice . She worries about jealous teammates . She worries about Eric . She worries that her daughter does n't come home as much as she used to , and these days , when she does , she 's often already eaten her lunch or dinner . <p> Sheryl used to love to sit down at her mother 's table and chow down on fried chicken , mashed potatoes and biscuits . <p> No vegetables , Louise says . Her daughter is not big on vegetables . <p> Louise hopes Sheryl will make the women 's basketball team in the ' 96 Olympics . She hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and want her mama to come along , too , or at least visit a whole lot . <p> Without Sheryl , she says , half-laughing , half-crying , " " What will I do ? I do n't think I can stand it . " <p> Growing up is hard . It 's hard on kids , and it 's hard on mamas  --  even superstars like Sheryl and Louise Swoopes . <p> NOTES : Claudia Feldman is a Chronicle reporter . E.Joseph Deering is a Chronicle photographer .
