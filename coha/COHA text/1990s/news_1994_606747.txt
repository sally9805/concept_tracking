<p> They all dress in black . Most are silver-haired and 60-ish . And they speak a legal language that 's all their own . <p> No wonder you 're having trouble keeping the Supreme Court justices straight . <p> But this court is actually more diverse and easier to keep straight than ever  --  nothing like the infamous " nine old men " who President Franklin D. Roosevelt tried to displace in the 1930s . The court has two women , an African American and the bench 's first Italian American justice . Each has a distinct personality and style . While the 1994-95 term is in its early days , here is a guide to the faces on the Supreme Court . <p> * Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist : Tall and broad-shouldered , Rehnquist , 70 , sits in the court 's center chair when justices are on the bench and demands that lawyers be precise in their arguments , correct in their terminology ( down to pronunciations ) and mindful of their half-hour time allotment . He 'll mercilessly cut a lawyer off mid-sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But off the bench , Rehnquist is easy-going , leading holiday sing-alongs and whimsically quoting popular verse . Once asked about the need for more consensus on this fractured court , he remarked that it was difficult to keep eight opinionated people in line and exclaimed that if anyone knew how , tell him ! He 's the leader of the core conservatives . He and Justice Sandra Day O'Connor were classmates at Stanford law school ; Rehnquist , six years her senior , delayed going to college because of Army Air Corps service during World War II . A native of suburban Milwaukee , Rehnquist plays tennis , is an amateur painter and would-be murder mystery writer . <p> * John Paul Stevens : The most senior of the liberal justices , the 74-year-old Stevens is one of the court 's intellectual lights , concerned about the philosophy of judging . But Stevens , known for sporting a bow tie , is idiosyncratic in his approach to the law , and when the ruling is 8 to 1 , he 's usually the " 1 . " He has often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case once he began filling them in on his legal reasoning . He once ironically referred to having established " such an enviable record at writing majority opinions that end up in a tie . " A Chicago native and Northwestern University Law School graduate , Stevens was a private pilot , a competitive bridge player and still plays a regular game of tennis . <p> * Sandra Day O'Connor : A friend once said that with O'Connor , " there ai n't no Miller Time . " Whether it be the law or recreation , the 64-year-old O'Connor is a hard driver . Justice William J. Brennan Jr . once said that he had compromised in a criminal law case because " Sandra forced my hand by threatening to lead the revolution . " Raised on a sprawling Arizona ranch , O'Connor is tall and athletic . She is a pragmatic , middle-of-the-roader who asks tough questions and has said the legal profession needs more civility . O'Connor is known for her efficiency on the court , getting her opinions out with great speed . She plays golf and tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> * Antonin Scalia : Nicknamed " Nino , " the 58-year-old Scalia is proud of his Italian American heritage and often reminds people that his name is pronounced " Ska-lee-ya , " not " Skal-ya . " The court 's bad boy : He is brash in his questioning and unyielding in complaints about colleagues ' legal reasoning , saying " bad ideas " deserve " clunking over the head . " The standard-bearer of the far right , Scalia loathes the news media and refuses to speak at televised events . But Scalia is a social charmer and a funny man who can turn a phrase . He once wrote , " Frequently , an issue of this sort will come before the court clad , so to speak , in sheep 's clothing ... . But this wolf comes as a wolf . " He 's a Harvard Law grad . He likes to sing the refrain of a folk song , " I 'm from New Jersey , and I do n't expect much . " That 's not true . <p> * Anthony M. Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earnest look with his short hair and wire-rimmed glasses . Dogged during oral arguments , Kennedy , who graduated from Harvard Law the year after Scalia , will return to the same concerns again and again . He has an avid interest in English literature , particularly Shakespeare , and court history . A centrist , Kennedy often talks about the difficulty of deciding tough cases : " Sometimes you do n't know if you 're Caesar about to cross the Rubicon or Captain Queeg cutting your own tow line , " he once said . When he decided to declare a law banning flag burning unconstitutional , Kennedy , a strong defender of the First Amendment , wrote to his colleagues that the case was exacting " a personal toll ... . The hard fact is that sometimes we must make decisions we do not like . " <p> * David H. Souter : If the court had an award for congeniality , Souter , a 55-year-old Yankee , would get it . The New Hampshire bachelor and Harvard Law grad seems to be the most liked by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes and calls of congratulations on anniversaries . Once when he changed votes in a case ( differing with Stevens ) , he told him , " I feel a little bit of a rotter in joining another justice 's opinion ... . But I believe I must do so . " Like Stevens , he tends to approach the law intellectually . Souter , who was called a " stealth " nominee in 1990 because so little was known of him then , has turned out to be more liberal than officials in the Bush administration had predicted . He still avoids the public eye , sticks to a small circle of friends from New Hampshire and watches a black-and-white television . <p> * Clarence Thomas : Quiet on the bench , the 46-year-old Pin Point , Ga. , native is talkative with court personnel . People know when he 's in his chambers by the smell of cigar smoke . Besides the stogies , Thomas 's other trademarks are a black Corvette and the fire he often lights in his office once the temperature dips below 50 degrees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students that the key to success is " preparation , preparation , preparation . " In his public speeches , he sometimes invokes the ordeal of his 1991 confirmation , when he was accused of sexual harassment . He called the episode " a circus ... a national disgrace . " <p> * Ruth Bader Ginsburg : Brooklyn-born , Ginsburg , 61 , is petite and always wears her straight black hair pulled back in a ribbon . A sharp questioner and diligent worker who does n't waste a minute , she keeps a stack of briefs next to her on the bench . Once she began wearing a fancy white collar over her black robes , O'Connor followed suit . Ginsburg boasts about her sophisticated , contemporary-furnished office filled with modern art . " They do n't look like a boudoir but they do look like a place that a woman would feel comfortable , " she said of her chambers . " No heavy drapes . No ... black leather furniture . " Sometimes shy off the bench , the Columbia Law grad and former women 's rights advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children 's concerns . President Clinton 's first appointee took a moderate to liberal approach in her first term , settling in just slightly to the right of Souter . <p> * Stephen G. Breyer : This San Francisco native has spent most of the last 25 years in Boston . As the freshman justice , Breyer , 56 , sits at the far right of the bench , but he is hardly on the fringes of arguments . A former Harvard Law School professor ( and graduate ) , he asks questions in paragraphs , summing up where the arguments have been and where he wants them to go . He 'll often ask , " As a practical matter ... " and pursue how some legal argument will play in the real world . Whether out of deference to the other justices or because he is composing his thoughts , Breyer often waits until a lawyer 's time is nearly out before he raises a query . Then , Breyer takes several minutes to frame the issue . Just about the time the lawyer gets a chance to begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
