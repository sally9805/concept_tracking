WHO WOULD HAVE THOUGHT A BEATLES SONG could presage a scientific discovery ? Astronomers report in the current Science that they have just found a wealth of diamonds floating inside the dense clouds of gas that drift between the stars . Warmed by stellar radiation , chemicals within the clouds emit ultrafaint light , a different sort for each kind of molecule . Observers have already used telescopes to identify the light from such substances as alcohol and formaldehyde . Now comes evidence of pure carbon in the crystalline form familiar to jewelers everywhere . Elizabeth Taylor need n't get excited : these diamonds are microscopic in size . While such " microdiamonds " have been found in meteorites , no one realized how abundant they apparently are in the vastness of space .
