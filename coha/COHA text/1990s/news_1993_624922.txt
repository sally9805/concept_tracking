<p> JASPER  --  Every evening , Johnnie Estes sits in a lawn chair just inside her garage , sipping a soft drink and gazing at the pine-shaded tract across the street . <p> The forested vista , which for nine years has been a source of tranquility at dusk , now causes the 66-year-old great-grandmother to fret . <p> Regional mental health officials want to build a $ 130,000 group home for six severely mentally retarded women on the two home-sized lots in the Bay Meadows neighborhood just south of town . <p> The proposal so angered Estes and her neighbors that they went to court to stop it . <p> A decision from state District Judge Joe Bob Golden is imminent . If he rules for the Lufkin-based Deep East Texas Regional Mental Health-Mental Retardation Services , residents say their idyllic neighborhood  --  where retirees walk at a fast clip and youngsters pedal Big Wheels noisily up and down driveways  --  will be ruined . <p> If Golden rules against the agency , however , it will be the first victory of its type for Texas landowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most court rulings in recent years and a bevy of state and federal laws have doled out the upper hand to the group homes , giving government agencies carte blanche to put the facilities anywhere , regardless of any other existing law or contract , Hart said . <p> " " This is a case about rights , " Hart said . " " Handicapped people have rights . But property owners have rights , too . " Residents say their property values will drop and their neighborhood will become unsafe if the facility is built . And , they add , it 's unfair the state is exempt from deed restrictions against such facilities while other landowners have to follow the regulations . <p> " " My heart aches for them , " Anna Kinnear , a longtime Bay Meadows resident , says of the clients of the proposed facility . <p> " " But I do n't want them here . " Susan Rushing , chief executive officer of Deep East Texas MHMR Services , said residents ' fears for their economic and personal safety are unfounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the community , " she said . <p> Group homes such as the one proposed for Jasper are called " intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded , " and are an accepted way of taking care of such clients , said Nancy Gravley , who heads the program for the state Department of Mental Health-Mental Retardation in Austin . <p> Thirty years ago , experts in the field decided there was n't benefit in " " warehousing " the mentally retarded in 6,000-bed institutions , she said . <p> The alternative : a residence for six people , built like a single-family home and set in an established neighborhood , so the clients can benefit from being in the community and not holed up behind walls . <p> Each is staffed around the clock by paid employees , headed by a mental retardation specialist and visited regularly by necessary physicians , therapists , counselors and nurses . The state licenses and inspects each home . <p> There are 700 of the homes in Texas , some owned by regional organizations like the Lufkin group , while others are owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasper facility will house six women , each " " profoundly " or " " seriously " retarded . It 's to be operated by the agency and is one of three funded by a charitable donation of $ 444,500 from the T.L.L. Temple foundation . The other two are slated for Diboll and Pineland . <p> Residents admit homes like these are needed , and they concede that much of their opposition is based on events that may or may not happen . <p> Still , they are adamant . <p> In a two-day hearing here earlier this summer , a local real estate agent testified that home values in the middle-class neighborhood could fall 25 to 40 percent if the home is built there . <p> " " For the retired people , their homes are the nest egg they 're depending on , " attorney Hart said . " " For the working people , their home is their equity . " <p> The lawsuit alleges that deed restrictions  --  contractual clauses that prohibit incongruities from house to house  --  disallow Deep East Texas MHMR from building there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictive covenants  --  prohibit multifamily dwellings , such as apartment or duplexes , in the 90 improved and vacant Bay Meadows lots . <p> A house for six nonrelated clients and live-in staff , even if it looks like a regular house , still constitutes a multifamily dwelling , Hart said . <p> Furthermore , the same covenants also prohibit the operation of businesses in the neighborhood . <p> " " They call them clients , " Hart said . " " It 's undeniable MHMR is in a business  --  rehabilitating clients . It 's commendable . But it 's still a business . " Hart and residents argue that the state should n't be allowed to violate contractual rules by which everyone else must abide . <p> There are other concerns . Residents are afraid retarded clients might wander the streets aimlessly , causing concern for their safety . <p> Bruce Ruckel is afraid such a person , capable of scaling fences and gates that restrict children , could drown in his backyard pool . <p> He said a family with a retarded member  --  either adult or child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objected to by neighbors . <p> " " If it 's your flesh and blood , you 're going to keep an eye on that person , " Ruckel said . " " But what 's to say ( group home workers ) will be able to do so ? " Others are wary that the clients will pose a direct threat . <p> " " You put six people together , each with the mental capacity of an 11- or 12-year-old , or younger , if they 're not supervised all the time , there 's trouble they can get into , " said one . <p> Residents also are angry they were n't notified of the decision to build the facility . <p> Relations did n't get any better . At a meeting between MHMR officials and residents , the discussion got heated , with angry residents taking the agency to task for the placement of the facility in their midst . <p> " " Then one of them stood up and said , " What are you having this meeting for ? We 've got the land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's nothing you can do about it , ' " Kinnear said . " " Then they left . " Rushing , who was n't present , acknowledges the meeting was tense , but defends the way her agency has handled the situation . <p> " " ( No one else ) has to ask permission of their future neighbors to buy or build a house , " she said . " " Why should we ? The law is very clear on this . <p> " " It stigmatizes ( the MHMR clients ) and borders on a breach of confidentiality to announce it to the neighborhood . " <p> She agreed that Deep East Texas MHMR  --  a political entity that contracts with the state to deliver services to clients in 13 counties  --  takes a firm stand on location of its homes . <p> " " It remains our position that our clients are citizens and have a right to live where they want to live , " she said . " " Our clients have the right to live and work and play in their communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be uneasy about this . We want to be good neighbors . We are good neighbors wherever we go . " <p> Rushing 's agency operates five such homes and eight more in the region are owned by private organizations . <p> She and advocates for the mentally retarded say there 's no evidence group homes drive down prices of neighboring properties . <p> Joe Voss and Doc Guy , real estate agents in neighboring Kirbyville , say there have been no economic effects from a five-year-old group home there . Most residents , in fact , are n't even aware of its existence . <p> There is no reason to fear MHMR clients , say experts . <p> " " One fear people have is the notion of mentally retarded people ( wandering ) around their neighborhoods and molesting their children , " said Liz Moore of The Arc , a national organization advocating rights and services for the mentally retarded . " " It 's not an emotional problem . By definition , they 're just slower . "
