// We 're the generation that wants our Levi 's cut to fit and our sauce on the side . So why not makeup , perfume , hair and skin care custom-made just for us ? Just a few seasons ago , all you had to do was be among the first to dab on whatever makeup or nail color had just made the biggest splash on the catwalks and voila ! instant It Girl potential . ( Few beauty junkies will soon forget Christian Dior 's Mascara Flash , Chanel 's edgy Vamp polish or Hard Candy 's candy-sweet pastel polishes . ) Shopping for a perfume was equally effortless : You followed your nose to the grandest department-store fragrance launches , then plunked down your cash for the hottest scent of the season ( think Elizabeth Arden Sunflowers or Calvin Klein CK one ) . But off-the-rack , **38;274;TOOLONG beauty may soon seem , well , very 1990s . The wave of the future ? Unique chic as in custom-blended makeup , hair therapies , skin care and fragrance . 1 MILLENNIUM MAKEUP New companies like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are proving that demand is high for this couture approach . At Custom Color outposts in Manhattan 's Henri Bendel department store and in Sephora stores nationwide , " lip chefs " create unique lipsticks and glosses ( from a subtle pearl to a glamorous glaze ) . Hem and haw over your options in person , or mail in a fabric swatch ( or a sample of a discontinued lipstick ) to be copied . If that 's not personalized enough , makeup artists at New York 's Laura Geller Make-Up Studio will make your dream lipstick shade and scent it for you too . 2 ACE OF BASE Even if lavender-scented lips are n't your idea of makeup nirvana , the perfect foundation shade might be . Elizabeth Arden Custom Color Foundation Technology , for instance , starts with an at-counter skin reading and turns out a computer-generated second-skin foundation match . Offering 18 formulas , three coverage levels and two finish options , it has loyal clients hooked . Prescriptives , the custom-beauty pioneer , will concoct a foundation at the counter that blends right into your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . ( Moisture boosters can be added for dry skin ; sebum-controlling ingredients for oily skin . ) Best of all , any leftover foundation that does n't fit in the bottles can become your perfectly coordinated concealer ( thanks to a gelling agent and titanium  --  based thickening formula ) . 3 FOR YOUR HAIR ONLY Since hair is no less deserving of individualized attention , mane mavens at J.E Lazartigue salons across the country and the Philip Kingsley Trichological Centers in New York and London offer hair analysis , advice and the requisite product suggestions . ( Kingsley does phone consultations too : Their trichologists evaluate mailed-in strands and follow up by phone . ) The Mark Garrison Salon in Manhattan offers essential-oil-based conditioning treatments tailormade for each head of hair . And the color  --  enhancing shampoos and conditioners from Aveda Personal Blends are hand-mixed and bottled while you wait . 4 FACE &; BODY BLENDS Photograph // Choosing skin care can also be a self  --  affirming experience too . The hip SkinMarket store in Los Angeles ( as well as Lush stores in England and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fragrances to whip up face masks for your complexion type . Farther north , San Franciscans flock to Body Time stores , where shelves are stocked with " base " products that can be tweaked with an array of essential oils and other natural ingredients . Likewise , at Bare Escentuals and The Body Shop , scent infusions can be added to lotions , washes , even bath salts . ( Bare Escentuals ' seemingly bottomless Scent Library includes everything from basic Green Apple and Freesia to more elusive aromas like Los Gatos Springtime. ) 5 ROYAL TREATMENT Custom-blended beauty has always been obtainable in perfumes , for a hefty sum . The British fragrance house Creed created scents for Queen Victoria , Grace Kelly and Audrey Hepburn , and now bottles signature perfumes for up to $25,000 a pop ( with one hitch : after five years , the scent is released to the masses for a mere $150- $180 a bottle ) . If you 'd have trouble describing your dream scent , try making your own . Catherine Bardey 's new Making Soaps and Scents : Creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Black Dog &; Leventhal , September 1999 ; $11 ) has recipes for everything from Provence Perfume Oil to Vanilla Bean Water .
