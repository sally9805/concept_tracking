<p> WITH a flurry of Middle East events creating a sense of urgency , the Palestinian Liberation Organization is attempting to throw off the ostracism it has experienced since the Gulf war . <p> It is having some success : PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat had a long-sought meeting this week with French Foreign Minister Roland Dumas - his first with a high-level Western official since the conflict . And on Wednesday , a delegation from the PLO 's executive committee met in Moscow with Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh . <p> In addition , United States Secretary of State James Baker III has met three times in recent weeks with PLO-approved Palestinian delegations from the Israeli-occupied territories . <p> But the PLO is still far from the level of international support it had achieved before Mr. Arafat aligned his organization with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein in the Gulf crisis . Even Palestinian leaders agree it will take time to repair the organization 's bridges , especially with the Arab countries of the anti-Saddam coalition . <p> Yet time is not something the PLO has in abundance , most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the region for a formula that has some chance of setting a Middle East peace process in motion . The PLO 's Central Council this week rejected the proposition for a regional conference to start the process among Israel and four of its Arab neighbors , but that is the likely direction of any breakthrough Baker might achieve . <p> Despite that official rejection , observers here say the fact that PLO-approved Palestinians are meeting with Baker is proof that the PLO recognizes its interest in pursuing dialogue now . <p> At the same time , Soviet emigration to Israel continues , while new Jewish settlements sprout in the occupied territories . And the Gulf states , until recently heavy bankrollers of the PLO and Palestinian support programs , are no nearer forgiving the PLO for its pro-Saddam stance than they were two months ago . <p> " Time is pressing and creating a sense of urgency , " says Khaled El Hassan , a member of the Palestinian National Council ( parliament ) . He is considered a moderate PLO leader who has maintained close contacts with most Arab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adds , " this is recognized as the time to make sure Washington does not forget everything it said during the crisis about the even application of international law . " <p> Some Palestinian leaders had suggested that this week 's Central Council meeting could include an unprecedented challenge to Arafat 's leadership over his handling of Gulf policy . But the threats failed to materialize . One observer said the council did n't want to " play into the Americans ' hands at such a crucial time . " <p> The expansion of Jewish settlements in Israeli-occupied Arab land is causing growing alarm among Palestinian leaders that opportunities for sovereignty may be narrowing . <p> " There is this feeling that something urgent must be done to deter Israel on the settlements , " says Jamail Hillal , director of the PLO 's information department . <p> The Central Council devoted considerable time to the settlement issue . Palestinian leaders meeting with Baker also emphasized it , Mr. Hillal says , and the delegation meeting Mr. Bessmertnykh was to have pressed the Soviets to " check the flow of immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviets to raise the issue in the United Nations Security Council . <p> A number of Palestinian leaders , however , say the PLO 's most pressing priority should be reestablishing relations with the spectrum of Arab nations - especially with the influential states that have moved closer to the US since the Gulf war . <p> The Central Council , which consists of 100 Palestinian leaders , decided to take such measures as asking other Arab representatives , such as the North African countries , to establish contacts on the PLO 's behalf with the Gulf states . A likely candidate for the go-between role is Morocco , which participated symbolically in the coalition against Iraq but maintained ties with Arafat , including receiving him on an official visit just before the Central Council meeting . <p> PLO leaders also agreed to promote a common position on the Palestinian issue among the four Arab countries - Egypt , Jordan , Syria , and Lebanon - that would be likely to meet with Israel at what the Palestinians prefer to call a " local " conference . <p> For Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since the Gulf states and Syria have signaled they are not interested in meeting an Arafat-led organization . <p> To skirt that problem , Hassan proposes creation of a Palestinian " provisional government " whose prime minister would be someone all Arabs could tolerate ( Arafat would in effect be the head of state ) . <p> Hassan says the idea enjoys considerable support among the Palestinian people - perhaps because they are feeling the effects of the cutoff from the Gulf states - but it is not a favorite cause within the organization . <p> Despite its difficulties , the PLO is still considered to hold a number of cards . Mr. Dumas 's willingness to meet with Arafat is believed in many quarters to be a first step toward reestablished links with the European Community , ties that were suspended during the Gulf war . <p> Some close observers believe that , given the prevailing strong and privileged relations between France and the US , it is likely the US was not opposed to a meeting from which it could cull some information on the PLO leader 's disposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiding the Palestinian cause : It is cited as an example of the kind of problem that could face world leaders if the issue of Palestinian sovereignty is not resolved . <p> Beyond that , some observers consider the average Arab 's association of international legality and " fair play " with " justice for the Palestinian " as one of the PLO 's strongest long-term advantages . Many Arab leaders insist that their region will not know peace without a resolution that is perceived as fair .
