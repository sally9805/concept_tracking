RAILROAD WATCHED BOBBY Lee grab the grandmother 's body under the armpits and drag her up the other side of the ditch . " Why n't you help him , Hiram , " he said . <p> Hiram took off his coat , skidded down into the ditch after Bobby Lee , and got hold of the old lady 's legs . Together he and Bobby Lee lugged her across the field toward the woods . Her broken blue hat was still pinned to her head , which lolled against Bobby Lee 's shoulder . The woman 's face grinned lopsidedly all the way into the shadow of the trees . <p> Railroad carried the cat over to the Studebaker . It occurred to him that he did n't know the cat 's name , and now that the entire family was dead he never would . It was a calico , gray striped with a broad white face and an orange nose . " What 's your name , puss-puss ? " he whispered , scratching it behind the ears . The cat purred . One by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car . A fracture zigzagged across the windshield , and the front passenger 's vent window was shattered . He stuffed Hiram 's coat into the vent window hole . Then he put the cat inside the car and shut the door . The cat put its front paws up on the dashboard and , watching him , gave a pantomime meow . <p> Railroad pushed up his glasses and stared off toward the woodline where Bobby Lee and Hiram had taken the bodies . The place was hot and still , silence broken only by birdsong from somewhere up the embankment behind him . He squinted up into the cloudless sky . Only a couple of hours of sun left . He rubbed the spot on his shoulder where the grandmother had touched him . Somehow he had wrenched it when he jerked away from her . <p> The last thing the grandmother had said picked at him : " You 're one of my own children . " The old lady had looked familiar , but she did n't look anything like his mother . But maybe his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Railroad knew he had - could the old lady have been his mother , for real ? It would explain why the woman who had raised him , the sweetest of women , could have been saddled with a son as bad as he was . <p> The idea caught in his head . He wished he 'd had the sense to ask the grandmother a few questions . The old woman might have been sent to tell him the truth . <p> When Hiram and Bobby Lee came back , they found Railroad leaning under the hood of the car . <p> " What we do now , boss ? " Bobby Lee asked . <p> " Police could be here any minute , " Hiram said . Blood was smeared on the leg of his khaki pants . " Somebody might of heard the shots . " <p> Railroad pulled himself out from under the hood . " Onliest thing we got to worry about now , Hiram , is how we get this radiator to stop leaking . You find a tire iron and straighten out this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off'n the other car . " <p> It took longer than the half hour Hiram had estimated to get the people 's Studebaker back on the road . By the time they did it was twilight , and the red-dirt road was cast in the shadows of the pinewoods . They pushed the stolen Hudson they 'd been driving off into the trees and got into the Studebaker . <p> Railroad gripped the wheel of the car and they bounced down the dirt road toward the main highway . Hat pushed back on his head , Hiram went through the dead man 's wallet , while in the back seat Bobby Lee had the cat on his lap and was scratching it under the chin . " **28;1423;TOOLONG , " he murmured . <p> " Sixty-eight dollars , " Hiram said . " With the twenty-two from the wife 's purse , that makes ninety bucks . " He turned around and handed a wad of bills to Bobby Lee . " Get rid of that damn cat , " he said . " Want me to hold yours for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the bills , and stuffed them into the pocket of the yellow shirt with bright blue parrots that had belonged to the husband who 'd been driving the car . Bailey Boy , the grandmother had called him . Railroad 's shoulder twinged . <p> The car shuddered ; the wheels had been knocked out of kilter when it rolled . If he tried pushing past fifty , it would shake itself right off the road . Railroad felt the warm weight of his pistol inside his belt , against his belly . Bobby Lee hummed tunelessly in the back seat . Hiram was quiet , fidgeting , looking out at the dark trees . He tugged his battered coat out of the vent window , tried to shake some of the wrinkles out of it . " You ought n't to use a man 's coat without saying to him , " he grumbled . <p> Bobby Lee spoke up . " He did n't want the cat to get away . " <p> Hiram sneezed . " Will you throw that damn animal out the damn window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bobby Lee said . <p> Railroad said nothing . He had always imagined that the world was slightly unreal , that he was meant to be the citizen of some other place . His mind was a box . Outside the box was that world of distraction , amusement , annoyance . Inside the box his real life went on , the struggle between what he knew and what he did n't know . He had a way of acting - polite , detached- because that way he would n't be bothered . When he was bothered , he got mad . When he got mad , bad things happened . <p> He had always been prey to remorse , but now he felt it more fully than he had since he was a boy . He had n't paid enough attention . He 'd pegged the old lady as a hypocrite and had gone back into his box , thinking her just another fool from that puppet world . But that moment of her touching him - she 'd wanted to comfort him . And he shot her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could be honest if you 'd only try .... Think how wonderful it would be to settle down and live a comfortable life and not have to think about somebody chasing you all the time . " <p> He knew she was only saying that to save her life . But that did n't mean it could n't also be a message . <p> Outside the box , Hiram asked , " What was all that yammer yammer with the grandmother about Jesus ? We doing all the killing while you yammer yammer . " <p> " He did shoot the old lady , " Bobby Lee said . " And made us carry her off to the woods , when if he 'd of waited she could of walked there like the others . We 're the ones get blood on our clothes . " <p> Railroad said quietly , " You do n't like the way things are going , son ? " <p> Hiram twitched against the seat like he was itchy between the shoulder blades . " I ai n't sayin ' that . I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to Atlanta . In Atlanta we can get lost . " <p> " Gon na get me a girl ! " Bobby Lee said . <p> " They got more cops in Atlanta than the rest of the state put together , " Hiram said . " In Florida .... " <p> Without taking his eyes off the road , Railroad snapped his right hand across the bridge of Hiram 's nose . Hiram jerked , more startled than hurt , and his hat tumbled off into the back seat . <p> Bobby Lee laughed , and handed Hiram his hat . <p> IT WAS after 11:00 when they hit the outskirts of Atlanta . Railroad pulled into a diner , the Sweet Spot , red brick and an asbestos-shingled roof , the air smelling of cigarettes and pork barbecue . Hiram rubbed some dirt from the lot into the stain on his pants leg . Railroad unlocked the trunk and found the dead man 's suitcase , full of clothes . He carried it in with them . <p> On the radio sitting on the shelf behind the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Made Honky-Tonk Angels . " Railroad studied the menu , front and back , and ordered biscuits and gravy . While they ate Bobby Lee ran on about girls , and Hiram sat sullenly smoking . Railroad could tell Hiram was getting ready to do something stupid . He did n't need either of them anymore . So after they finished eating , Railroad left the car keys on the table and took the suitcase into the men 's room . He locked the door . He pulled his .38 out of his waistband , put it on the sink , and changed out of the too-tight dungarees into some of the dead husband 's baggy trousers . He washed his face and hands . He cleaned his glasses on the tail of the parrot shirt , then tucked in the shirt . He stuck the .38 into the suitcase and came out again . Bobby Lee and Hiram were gone , and the car was no longer in the parking lot . The bill on the table , next to Hiram 's still smoldering cigarette , was for six dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking his coffee . In the window of the diner , near the door , a piece of cardboard had been taped up , saying , " WANTED : FRY COOK . " When he was done with the coffee , he untaped the sign and headed to the register . After he paid the bill he handed the cashier the sign . " I 'm your man , " he said . <p> The cashier called the manager . " Mr. Cauthron , this man says he 's a cook . " <p> Mr. Cauthron was maybe thirty-five years old . His carrot red hair stood up in a pompadour like a rooster 's comb , and a little belly swelled out over his belt . " What 's your name ? " <p> " Lloyd Bailey . " <p> " Lloyd , what experience do you have ? " <p> " I can cook anything on this here menu , " Railroad said . <p> The manager took him back to the kitchen . " Stand aside , Shorty , " the manager said to the tall black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said to Railroad . <p> Railroad washed his hands , put on an apron , broke two eggs into a bowl . He threw handfuls of chopped onion , green pepper , and diced ham into a skillet . When the onions were soft , he poured the beaten eggs over the ham and vegetables , added salt and cayenne pepper . When he slid the finished omelet onto a plate , the manager bent down over it as if he were inspecting the paint job on a used car . He straightened up . " Pay 's thirty dollars a week . Be here at six in the morning . " <p> Out in the lot Railroad set down his bag and looked around . Cicadas buzzed in the hot city night . Around the corner from the diner he 'd noticed a big Victorian house with a sign on the porch , " Rooms for Rent . " He was about to start walking when , out of the comer of his eye , he caught a movement by the trash barrel next to the chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cat trying to leap up to the top to get at the garbage . He went over , held out his hand . The cat did n't run ; it sniffed him , butted its head against his hand . <p> He picked it up , cradled it under his arm , and carried it and the bag to the rooming house . Under dense oaks , it was a big tan clapboard mansion with green shutters and hanging baskets of begonias on the porch , and a green porch swing . The thick oval leaded glass of the oak door was beveled around the edge , the brass of the handle dark with age . <p> The door was unlocked . His heart jumped a bit at the opportunity it presented ; at the same time he wanted to warn the proprietor against such foolishness . Off to one side of the entrance was a little table with a doily , vase and dried flowers ; on the other a sign beside a door said , " manager . " <p> Railroad knocked . After a moment the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened it . She was not young , perhaps forty , with very white skin and blonde hair . She looked at him , smiled , saw the cat under his arm . " What a sweet animal , " she said . <p> " I 'd like a room , " he said . <p> " I 'm sorry . We do n't cater to pets , " the woman said , not unkindly . <p> " This here 's no pet , Ma 'm , " Railroad said . " This here 's my only friend in the world . " <p> The landlady 's name was Mrs. Graves . The room she rented him was twelve feet by twelve feet , with a single bed , a cherry veneer dresser , a wooden table and chair , a narrow closet , lace curtains on the window , and an old pineapple quilt on the bed . The air smelled sweet . On the wall opposite the bed was a picture in a dime store frame , of an empty rowboat floating in an angry gray ocean , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance from a sunset that was not in the picture . <p> The room cost ten dollars a week . Despite Mrs. Graves 's rule against pets , like magic she took a shine to Railroad 's cat . It was almost as if she 'd rented the room to the cat , with Railroad along for the ride . After some consideration , he named the cat Pleasure . She was the most affectionate animal he had ever seen . She wanted to be with him , even when he ignored her . She made him feel wanted ; she made him nervous . Railroad fashioned a cat door in the window of his room so that Pleasure could go out and in whenever she wanted , and not be confined to the room when Railroad was at work . <p> The only other residents of the boarding house were Louise Parker , a school teacher , and Charles Foster , a lingerie salesman . Mrs. Graves cleaned Railroad 's room once a week , swept the floors , alternated the quilt every other week with a second one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood . He worked at the diner from six in the moming , when Maisie , the cashier , unlocked , until Shorty took over at three in the afternoon . The counter girl was Betsy , and Service , a Negro boy , bussed tables and washed dishes . Railroad told them to call him Bailey , and did n't talk much . <p> When he was n't working , Railroad spent most of his time at the boarding house , or evenings in a small nearby park . Railroad would take the Bible from the drawer in the boarding house table , buy an afternoon newspaper , and carry them with him . Pleasure often followed him to the park . She would lunge after squirrels and shy away from dogs , hissing sideways . Cats liked to kill squirrels , and dogs liked to kill cats . But there was no sin in it . Pleasure would not go to hell , or heaven . Cats had no souls . <p> The world was full of stupid people like Bobby Lee and Hiram , who lied to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Turn to the right , it was a wall . Turn to the left , it was a wall . Look up it was a ceiling , look down it was a floor . And Railroad had taken out his imprisonment on others ; he was not deceived in his own behavior . <p> Railroad did not believe in sin , but somehow he felt it . Still , he was not a dog or a cat , he was a man . You 're one of my own children . There was no reason why he had to kill people . He only wished he 'd never have to deal with any Hirams and Bobby Lees anymore . He gazed across the park at the Ipana toothpaste sign painted on the wall of the Piggly Wiggly . Whiter than white . Pleasure crouched at the end of the bench , her haunches twitching as she watched a finch hop across the sidewalk . <p> Railroad picked her up , rubbed his cheek against her whiskers . " Pleasure , I 'll tell you what , " he whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from Bobby Lee and Hiram , and I 'll never kill anybody again . " <p> The cat looked at him with its clear yellow eyes . <p> Railroad sighed . He put the cat down . He leaned back on the bench and opened the newspaper . Beneath the fold on the front page he read , <p> ESCAPED CONVICTS KILLED IN WRECK <p> VALDOSTA - Two escaped convicts and an unidentified female passenger were killed Tuesday when the late model stolen automobile they were driving struck a bridge abutment while being pursued by State Police . <p> The deceased convicts , Hiram Leroy Burgett , 31 , and Bobby Lee Ross , 21 , escaped June 23 while being transported to the State Hospital for the Criminally Insane for psychological evaluation . A third escapee , Ronald Reuel Pickens , 47 , is still at large . <p> THE LUNCH RUSH was petering out . There were two people at the counter and four booths were occupied , and Railroad had set a . BLT and an order of fried chicken with collards up on the shelf when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Police wants to talk to you , Mr. C. " Railroad peeked out from behind the row of hanging order slips . A man in a suit sat at the counter , sipping sweet tea . Cauthron went out to talk to him . <p> " Two castaways on a raft , " Betsy called to Railroad . The man spoke with Cauthron for a few minutes , showed him a photograph . Cauthron shook his head , nodded , shook his head again . They laughed . Railroad eyed the back door of the diner , but turned back to the grill . By the time he had the toast up and the eggs fried , the man was gone . Cauthron stepped back to his office without saying anything . <p> At the end of the shift he pulled Railroad aside . " Lloyd , " he said . " I need to speak with you . " <p> Railroad followed him into the cubbyhole he called his office . Cauthron sat behind the cluttered metal desk and picked up a letter from the top layer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Social Security saying that number you gave is not valid . " He looked up at Railroad , his china blue eyes unreadable . <p> Railroad took off his glasses and rubbed the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger . He did n't say anything . <p> " I suppose it 's just some mixup , " Cauthron said . " Same as that business with the detective this afternoon . Do n't you worry about it . " <p> " Thank you , Mr. Cauthron . " <p> " One other thing , before you go , Lloyd . Did I say your salary was thirty a week ? I meant twenty-five . That okay with you ? " <p> " Whatever you say , Mr. Cauthron . " <p> " And I think , in order to encourage trade , we 'll start opening at five . I 'd like you to pick up the extra hour . Starting Monday . " <p> Railroad nodded . " Is that all ? " <p> " That 's it , Lloyd . " Cauthron seemed suddenly to enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tongue and watching for his reaction . " Thanks for being such a Christian employee . " <p> Railroad went back to his room in the rooming house . Pleasure mewed for him , and when he sat on the bed , hopped into his lap . But Railroad just stared at the picture of the rowboat on the opposite wall . After a while the cat hopped onto the window sill and out through her door onto the roof . <p> Only a crazy person would use the knowledge that a man was a murderer in order to cheat that man out of his pay . How could he know that Railroad would n't kill him , or run away , or do both ? <p> Lucky for Cauthron that Railroad had made his deal with Pleasure . But now he did n't know what to do . If the old lady 's message was from God , then maybe this was his first test . Nobody said being good was supposed to be easy . Nobody said , just because Railroad was turning to good , everybody he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pleasure to save him from Bobby Lee and Hiram , not Mr. Cauthron . <p> He needed guidance . He slid open the drawer of the table . Beside the Bible was his .38 . He flipped open the cylinder , checked to see that all the chambers were loaded , then put it back into the drawer . He took out the Bible and opened it at random . <p> The first verse his eyes fell on was from Deuteronomy : " These you may eat of all that are in the waters : you may eat all that have fins and scales . And whatever does not have fins and scales you shall not eat . " <p> There was a knock at the door . Railroad looked up . " Yes ? " <p> " Mr. Bailey ? " It was Mrs. Graves . " I thought you might like some tea . " <p> Keeping his finger in the Bible to mark his page , Railroad got up and opened the door . Mrs. Graves stood there with a couple of tall glasses , beaded with sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of you , Miz Graves . Would you like to come in ? " " Thank you , Mr. Bailey . " She set the tray down on the table , gave him a glass . It was like nectar . " Is it sweet enough ? " <p> " It 's perfect , ma 'm . " <p> She wore a yellow print before , and her gray eyes exuded compassion , as if to say , I know who you are but that does n't matter . <p> They sat down , he on the bed , she on the chair . She saw the Bible in his hand . " I find many words of comfort in the Bible . " <p> " I ca n't say as I find much comfort in it , ma 'm . Too many bloody deeds . " <p> " But many acts of goodness . " <p> " You said a true word . " <p> " Sometimes I wish I could live in the world of goodness . " She smiled . " But this world is good enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Eve ate the apple , ma 'm , it 's a world of good and evil . How can goodness make up for the bad ? That 's a mystery to me . " <p> She sipped her tea . " Of course it 's a mystery . That 's the point . " <p> " The point is , something 's always after you , deserve it or not . " <p> " What a sad thought , Mr. Bailey . " <p> " Yes 'm . From minute to minute , we fade away . Only way to get to heaven is to die . " <p> AFTER MRS . GRAVES left he sat thinking about her beautiful face . Like an angel . Nice titties , too . <p> He would marry her . He would rnarry her . He would settle down , like the grandmother said . But he would have to get an engagement ring . If he 'd been thinking , he could have taken the grandmother 's ring-but how was he supposed to know when he 'd killed her that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the dresser , felt among the dead man 's clothes until he found the sock , pulled out his savings . It was only forty-three dollars . <p> The only help for it was to ask Pleasure . Railroad paced the room . It was a long time , and Railroad began to worry , before the cat came back . The cat slipped silently through her door , lay down on the table , simple as you please , in the wedge of sunlight coming in the window . Railroad got down on his knees , his face level with the table top . The cat went " Mrrph ? " and raised its head . Railroad gazed into her steady eyes . <p> " Pleasure , " he said . " I need to get an engagement ring , and I do n't have enough money . Get one for me . " <p> The cat watched him . <p> He waited for some sign . Nothing happened . <p> Then , like a dam bursting , a flood of confidence flowed into him . He knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the Sweet Spot whistling . He spent much of his shift imagining when and how he would ask Mrs. Graves for her hand . Maybe on the porch swing , on Saturday night ? Or at breakfast some morning ? He could leave the ring next to his plate and she would find it , with his note , when clearing the table . Or he could come down to her room in the middle of the night , and he 'd ram himself into her in the darkness , make her whimper , then lay the perfect diamond on her breast . <p> At the end of the shift he took a beefsteak from the diner 's refrigerator as an offering to Pleasure . But when he entered his room the cat was not there . He left the meat wrapped in butcher paper in the kitchen downstairs , then went back up and changed into Bailey Boy 's baggy suit . At the corner he took the bus downtown and walked into the first jewelry store he saw . He made the woman show him several diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman went to answer it he pocketed a ring and walked out . No clerk in her right mind should be so careless , but it went exactly as he had imagined it . As easy as breathing . <p> That night he had a dream . He was alone with Mrs. Graves , and she was making love to him . But as he moved against her , he felt the skin of her full breast deflate and wrinkle beneath his hand , and he found he was making love to the dead grandmother , her face grinning the same vacant grin it had when Hiram and Bobby Lee hauled her into the woods . <p> Railroad woke in terror . Pleasure was sitting on his chest , her face an inch from his , purring loud as a diesel . He snatched the cat up in both hands and hurled her across the room . She hit the wall with a thump , then fell to the floor , claws skittering on the hardwood . She scuttled for the window , through the door onto the porch roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slow down , and then he could not sleep . <p> Someone is always after you . That day in the diner , when Railroad was taking a break , sitting on a stool in front of the window fan sipping some ice water , Cauthron came out of the office and put his hand on his shoulder , the one that still hurt occasionally . " Hot work , ai n't it boy ? " <p> " Yessir . " Railroad was ten or twelve years older than Cauthron . <p> " What is this world coming to ? " Maisie said to nobody in particular . She had the newspaper open on the counter and was scanning the headlines . " You read what it says here about some man robbing a diamond ring right out from under the nose of the clerk at Merriam 's Jewelry . " <p> " I saw that already , " Mr. Cauthron said . And after a moment , " White fellow , was n't it ? " <p> " It was , " sighed Maisie . " Must be some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not had the benefit of a Christian upbringing . " <p> " They 'll catch him . Men like that always get caught . " Cauthron leaned in the doorway of his office , arms crossed above his belly . " Maisie , " Cauthron said . " Did I tell you Lloyd here is the best short order cook we 've had in here since 1947 ? The best white short order cook . " <p> " I heard you say that . " <p> " I mean , makes you wonder where he was before he came here . Was he short order cooking all round Atlanta ? Seems like we would of heard , do n't it ? Come to think , Lloyd never told me much about where he was before he showed up that day . He ever say much to you , Maisie ? " <p> " Ca n't say as I recall . " <p> " You ca n't recall because he has n't . What you say , Lloyd ? Why is that ? " <p> " No time for conversation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You carrying some resentment , Lloyd ? <p> We ai n't paying you enough ? " <p> " I did n't say that . " <p> " Because , if you do n't like it here , I 'd be unhappy to lose the best white short order cook I had since 1947 . " <p> Railroad put down his empty glass and slipped on his paper hat . " I ca n't afford to lose this job . And , you do n't mind my saying , Mr. Cauthron , you 'd come to regret it if I was forced to leave . " <p> " Were n't you listening , Lloyd ? Is n't that what I just said ? " <p> " Yes , you did . Now maybe we ought to quit bothering Maisie with our talk and get back to work . " <p> " I like a man that enjoys his job , " Cauthron said , slapping Railroad on the shoulder again . " I 'd have to be suicidal to make a good worker like you leave . Do I look suicidal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look suicidal , Mr. Cauthron . " <p> " I see Pleasure all the time going down the block to pick at the trash by the Sweet Spot , " Mrs. Graves told him as they sat on the front porch swing that evening . " That cat could get hurt if you let it out so much . That is a busy street . " <p> Foster had gone to a ball game , and Louise Parker was visiting her sister in Chattanooga , so they were alone . It was the opportunity Railroad had been waiting for . <p> " I do n't want to keep her a prisoner , " he said . The chain of the swing creaked as they rocked slowly back and forth . He could smell her lilac perfume . The curve of her thigh beneath her print dress caught the light from the front room coming through the window . <p> " You 're a man who has spent much time alone , are n't you , " she said . " So mysterious . " <p> He had his hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated . A couple walking down the sidewalk nodded at them . He could n't do it out here , where the world might see . " Mrs. Graves , would you come up to my room ? I have something I need to show you . " <p> She did not hesitate . " I hope there 's nothing wrong . " <p> " No , ma 'm . Just something I 'd like to rearrange . " He opened the door for her and followed her up the stairs . The clock in the hall ticked loudly . He opened the door to his room and ushered her in , closed the door behind them . When she turned to face him he fell to his knees . <p> He held up the ring in both hands , his offering . " Miz Graves , I want you to marry me . " <p> She looked at him kindly , her expression calm . The silence stretched . She reached out ; he thought she was going to take the ring , but instead she touched his wrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " Why , I hardly know you . " <p> Railroad felt dizzy . " You could some time . " <p> " I 'll never marry again , Mr. Bailey . It 's not you . " <p> Not him . It was never him , had never been him . His knees hurt from the hardwood floor . He looked at the ring , lowered his hands , clasped it in his fist . She moved her hand from his wrist to his shoulder , squeezed it . A knife of pain ran down his arm . Without standing , he punched Mrs. Graves in the stomach . <p> She gasped and fell back onto the bed . He was on her in a second , one hand over her mouth while he ripped her dress open from the neck . She struggled , and he pulled the pistol out from behind his back and held it to her head . She lay still . <p> " Do n't you stop me , now , " he muttered . He tugged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ladylike it was of her to keep so silent . <p> Much later , lying on the bed , eyes dreamily focused on the light fixture in the center of the ceiling , it came to him what had bothered him about the grandmother . She had ignored the fact that she was going to die . " She would of been a good woman , if it had been somebody there to shoot her every minute of her life , " he 'd told Bobby Lee . And that was true . But then , for that last moment , she became a good woman . The reason was that , once Railroad convinced her she was going to die , she could forget about it . In the end , when she reached out to him , there was no thought in her mind about death , about the fact that he had killed her son and daughter-in-law and grandchildren and was soon going to kill her . All she wanted was to comfort him . She did n't even care if he could n't be comforted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of the past or regard for the future , out of the instinct of her soul and nothing else . <p> Like the cat . Pleasure lived that way all the time . The cat did n't know about Jesus ' sacrifice , about angels and devils . That cat looked at him and saw what was there . <p> He raised himself on his elbows . Mrs. Graves lay very still beside him , her blond hair spread across the pineapple quilt . He felt her neck for a pulse . <p> It was dark night now : the whine of insects in the oaks outside the window , the rush of traffic on the cross street , drifted in on the hot air . Quietly , Railroad slipped out into the hall and down to Foster 's room . He put his ear to the door and heard no sound . He came back to his own room , wrapped Mrs. Graves in the quilt and , as silently as he could , dragged her into his closet . He closed the door . <p> Railroad heard purring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " God damn you . God damn you to hell , " he said to the cat , but before he could grab her , the calico had darted out the window . <p> HE FIGURED IT OUT . The idea of marrying Mrs. Graves had been only a stage in the subtle revenge being taken on him by the dead grandmother , through the cat . The wishes Pleasure had granted were the bait , the nightmare had been a warning . But he had n't listened . <p> He rubbed his sore shoulder . The old lady 's gesture , like a mustardseed , had grown to be a great crow-filled tree in Railroad 's heart . A good trick the devil had played on him . Now , no matter how he reformed himself , he could not get rid of what he had done . <p> It was hot and still , not a breath of air , as if the world were being smothered in a fever blanket . A milk-white sky . The kitchen of the Sweet Spot was hot as the furnace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slick the warm pistol slid into his belt . Railroad was fixing a stack of buttermilk pancakes when the detective walked in . <p> The detective walked over to the counter and sat down on one of the stools . Maisie was not at the counter ; she was probably in the ladies ' room . The detective took a look around , then plucked a menu from behind the napkin holder in front of him and started reading . On the radio Hank Williams was singing " I 'm So Lonesome I Could Cry . " <p> Quietly , Railroad untied his apron and slipped out of the back door . In the alley near the trash barrels he looked out over the lot . He was about to hop the chain link fence when he saw Cauthron 's car stopped at the light on the comer . <p> Railroad pulled out his pistol , crouched behind a barrel and aimed at the space in the lot where Cauthron usually parked . He felt something bump against his leg . <p> It was Pleasure . " Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal away . <p> The cat came back , put her front paws up on his thigh , purring . <p> " Damn you ! You owe me , you little demon ! " he hissed . He let the gun drop , looked down at the cat . <p> Pleasure looked up at him . " Miaow ? " <p> " What do you want ! You want me to stop , do you ? Then make it go away . Make it so I never killed nobody . " <p> Nothing happened . It was just a fucking animal . In a rage , he dropped the gun and seized the cat in both hands . She twisted in his grasp , hissing . <p> " You know what it 's like to hurt in your heart ? " Railroad tore open his shirt and pressed Pleasure against his chest . " Feel it ! Feel it beating there ! " Pleasure squirmed and clawed , hatching his chest with a web of scratches . " You owe me ! You owe me ! " Railroad was shouting now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally twisted out of his grasp . The cat fell , rolled , and scurried away , running right under Cauthron 's car as it pulled into the lot . With a little bump , the car 's left front tire ran over her . <p> Cauthron jerked the car to a halt . Pleasure howled , still alive , writhing , trying to drag herself away on her front paws . Her back was broken . Railroad looked at the fence , looked back . <p> He ran over to Pleasure and knelt down . Cauthron got out of the car . Railroad tried to pick up the cat , but she hissed and bit him . Her sides fluttered with rapid breathing . Her eyes clouded . She rested her head on the gravel . <p> Railroad had trouble breathing . He looked up from his crouch to see that Maisie and some customers had come out of the diner . Among them was the detective . <p> " I did n't mean to do that , Lloyd , " Cauthron said . " It just ran out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Jesus Christ , Lloyd , what happened to your chest ? " <p> Railroad picked up the cat in his bloody hands . " Nobody ever gets away with nothing , " he said . " I 'm ready to go now . " <p> " Go where ? " <p> " Back to prison . " <p> " What are you talking about ? " <p> " Me and Hiram and Bobby Lee killed all those folks in the woods and took their car . This was their cat . " <p> " What people ? " <p> " Bailey Boy and his mother and his wife and his kids and his baby . " <p> The detective pushed back his hat and scratched his head . " You all best come in here and we 'll talk this thing over . " <p> They went into the diner . Railroad would not let them take Pleasure from him until they gave him a corrugated cardboard box to put the body in . Maisie brought him a towel to wipe his hands , and Railroad told the detective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Hospital for the Criminally Insane , and the hearselike Hudson , and the family they 'd murdered in the backwoods . Mostly he talked about the grandmother and the cat . Shaw sat there and listened soberly . At the end he folded up his notebook and said , " That 's quite a story , Mr. Bailey . But we caught the people who did that killing , and it ai n't you . " <p> " What do you mean ? I know what I done . " <p> " Another thing , you do n't think I 'd know if there was some murderer loose from the penitentiary ? There is n't anyone escaped . " <p> " What were you doing in here last week , asking questions ? " <p> " I was having myself some pancakes and coffee . " <p> " I did n't make this up . " <p> " So you say . But seems to me , Mr. Bailey , you been standing over a hot stove too long . " <p> Railroad did n't say anything . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cauthron told him he might just as well take the morning off and get some rest . He would man the griddle himself . Railroad got unsteadily to his feet , took the box containing Pleasure 's body , and tucked it under his arm . He walked out of the diner . <p> He went back to the boarding house . He climbed the steps . Mr. Foster was in the front room reading the newspaper . " Morning , Bailey , " he said . <p> " What you got there ? " <p> " My cat got killed . " <p> " No ! Sorry to hear that . " <p> " You seen Miz Graves this morning ? " he asked . <p> " Not yet . " <p> Railroad climbed the stairs , walked slowly down the hall to his room . He entered . Dust motes danced in the sunlight coming through the window . The ocean rowboat was no darker than it had been the day before . He set the dead cat down next to the Bible on the table . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the rose . He reached into his pocket and felt the engagement ring . <p> The closet door was closed . He went to it , put his hand on the doorknob . He turned it and opened the door . <p> IMG
