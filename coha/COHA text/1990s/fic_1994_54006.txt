QUINOA WAS N'T IN THE dictionary . Owen checked twice , but the listings went straight from quinine to quinoid . <p> Thinking he must have misspelled it , he looked back to the box of Bengal Spice tea where he 'd read quinoa among the list of ingredients , but now he could n't locate it there , either . He 'd have sworn he 'd seen it after nutmeg and cloves , but now cloves was the last ingredient . <p> Nor could he find anything he could have misread to produce the word . That was odd . Must be the stress , he thought . Seeing words that were n't there would n't be the first strange thing he 'd done since losing both Richard and his job . <p> He set the dictionary down on the countertop separating the kitchen from the living room . The walls above the love seat and the stereo did n't look so bare anymore  --  he had stapled up Van Gogh poster prints where Richard 's paintings had been  --  but the bookshelves and the CD rack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while to refill . <p> The tea 's spicy aroma filled the kitchen . Owen lifted the cup , blew across the top , and took a sip . Something about it did suggest India , or Arabia . Foreign , anyway . It tasted fine even without quinoa . <p> He took both cup and dictionary down the hallway into his study . Spreading the morning newspaper out on his drafting table , he pulled aside the curtain on the street-facing window to give him more light and began the morning ritual of looking through the want ads . He found the usual glut of accounting and auto body jobs , but once again no draftsmen . Plenty of restaurant jobs and sales positions , but no openings for surveyors , either . If this kept up , he was going to run out of unemployment compensation before he found anything . <p> Another ad caught his attention : Stevedore . There was no job description , just a number to call . Owen tried to remember what a stevedore did , but if he 'd ever known , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the dictionary right there . He flipped it open and paged through the S 's . <p> No stevedore . The listing went from stethoscope to stew . Hmm , he thought . Was n't much of a dictionary , was it ? He shook his head sadly . The dictionary  --  like the tea  --  had belonged to his housemate , until Richard had left for Calcutta three months ago to join an eastern religion Owen could n't even pronounce . Owen had sneaked it out of a packing box so he 'd have something of Richard 's to remember him by , but until lately he had n't felt the need to actually use it . Good thing ; even now the disappointment was intense , like being rejected all over again . <p> That was silly . It was just a dictionary , and not a very good one at that . He was trying hard not to be vengeful about it , but even so , a dictionary without " stevedore " was missing something . <p> He flipped to the F 's , remembering how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fun , but " fuck " was n't there . Nor was " fornicate . " Well , that was somehow appropriate . Since Richard had left , Owen had n't had so much as a date . Not that he had n't tried , but one of the people he 'd attempted to strike up a relationship with had turned out to be his boss 's nephew , and now he was out of a job . <p> He closed the dictionary and looked back to the paper . Maybe he would just call the number and ask what a stevedore was . But when he looked for the ad , he could n't find that , either . <p> What the heck ? He traced the columns of jobs . They were alphabetized ; he saw sales , screen printers , steelworkers , then summer jobs . No stevedore . But it had been there just a minute ago . He would n't have made up a whole job listing , not for something as unlikely as " stevedore . " <p> There was another explanation , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was completely crazy to imagine it could be true . <p> Owen did n't mind . Right now he felt as if he were at least halfway insane anyway . So he picked another ad from the paper  --  taxi driver  --  and flipped through the dictionary to the T 's . No listing for taxi . <p> He 'd kept his finger on the ad for taxi drivers , but when he looked back down , it now pointed to " teachers . " <p> Owen stared at the newspaper for a long while , not really seeing anything printed there . He shifted his gaze to the dictionary . It looked like a standard collegiate , hardbound in red cloth , but instead of Webster 's , the name read , " Drake 's Deleting Dictionary . " <p> Where had Richard gotten it ? Owen had no idea . He looked for a publisher 's mark on the copyright page , but there was no copyright page . Good grief , did it contain anything it was supposed to ? <p> Of course it did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ random  --  the pages parted to the same F 's he 'd been at before  --  and read the first entry he saw : fundamentalist , noun : an adherent of fundamentalism . He closed the dictionary , wondering why it would have fundamentalist but not stevedore , then a sudden suspicion made him open it to the F 's again . No fundamentalist . There was fundament , and fundus , but no fundamentalist . Or fundamentalism either , for that matter . Evidently whatever he intentionally looked up disappeared . <p> Too bad I could n't get rid of the real thing that easily , he thought . The fundies and their anti-gay attitudes had been a thorn in his side ever since . . . ever since when ? Come to think of it , they 'd never really amounted to much after their " no special rights " ballot measure had died at the polls . Owen had n't heard much about them for over a year . <p> Or had he ? There was a fuzziness to his thoughts that bothered him . Had n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to introduce another bill in the state senate ? He dug out the front page and scanned the headlines . Nothing about it . Just an article on the chronic public transportation problems , another about a mysterious crop failure in the Peruvian Andes , and another about a new automated cargo-handling system for unloading ships . <p> The hair was beginning to stand up on the back of his neck . Had he somehow wiped out the entire concept of fundamentalism just by looking it up in Richard 's dictionary ? It seemed impossible , but so did want ads vanishing , and ingredients from his tea . <p> He needed something he could test . Something physical that he knew was there , like the teacup . Good enough : Teacup . He opened the dictionary to the T 's and ran his finger down the column past " teacher . " <p> He heard a wet sploosh beside him , and hot tea flooded the drafting table . It ran off the edge onto his lap , and he leaped up , howling in pain and fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the kitchen and pulled a handful of paper towels off the roll beneath the cupboard , then ran back and sopped up what had n't already soaked into the newspaper or dripped to the floor . <p> The dictionary had been splashed , too . Owen wiped off the wet pages and fluttered them until they were dry , then threw away the towels and the soggy newspaper and sat back down at the table . <p> Richard 's dictionary could make things disappear . Why had n't he used it ? Owen wondered , then he thought , Maybe he had . Who could say what the world had been like before Richard started tinkering with it ? Unless Owen had been involved directly , he probably would n't have remembered the changes . <p> Whatever Richard might have done , there was still plenty left for Owen to do . The possibilities were endless . He quickly looked up " prejudice " and " bigotry . " Neither one was listed , and presumably neither concept existed now , either . He shuffled through the papers on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in , but the pink slip was still there . Too subtle , maybe ? He tried " unemployment , " and that time he got results . <p> The pink slip had disappeared , but so had his paycheck . And something had changed down by his feet . Owen looked down and found a chain connecting his left ankle to his drafting table . What the  --  ? <p> A loud crack came from outside , and someone screamed . Owen scooted over to the window  --  he had to stretch out his leg to reach it  --  and looked out . A line of convicts shuffled past on the sidewalk , chained together at the ankles just like he was chained to his desk , and a burly guard paced along beside them , flicking a whip to lash the back of anyone who stumbled . <p> " Holy shit , " Owen whispered . " Those are n't convicts ; they 're slaves . " And so was he . He 'd eliminated unemployment , all right . <p> Frantically , he looked up " slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his ankle . He looked out the window again and was reassured to see just the normal pedestrian traffic . Well , not necessarily " normal " ; everyone seemed to be striding along with much more determination than usual , as if they had places to go and no time to waste . Better than dragging chains , though . <p> Owen looked back to his drafting table . He did n't recognize the half-finished and now tea-stained topographic map taped there . . . but the longer he looked at it , the more familiar it became . A freelance job ? Yes , that was it . He dug through the papers until he found the job order , complete with a check for half the work in advance . <p> All right . He 'd squeaked through on that one . Maybe it was time to put the dictionary away before he got into worse trouble . But he still had one problem . . . <p> He considered looking up " abandonment , " but he was n't so sure he wanted Richard back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't leave him for an eastern religion . What he wanted was not to be lonely anymore . <p> Yes , of course ! He eagerly flipped through the L 's , looking  --  for the last time in his life  --  for " loneliness . " <p> It was n't there , of course . <p> He heard a soft noise from the other side of the house . A sigh ? Good God , had the mysterious dictionary actually created a companion for him already ? Without his even having to go out ? He stood up from his drafting table and walked hesitantly down the hallway into the living room , at once hopeful and afraid of what he might find , but his trepidation melted away when he saw the soft , fuzzy golden labrador puppy . <p> Hmm . Not exactly what he 'd been expecting but when the puppy tilted its head sideways and blinked at him with its big round eyes , he could n't help smiling . He hefted the dictionary in his hand , then laid it down on the coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But by the time the puppy had messed on the carpet and chewed up his shoes , it had already eaten the dictionary . <p> <p> By Jerry Oltion <p> Jerry Oltion 's short fiction has won the Analog Reader 's Choice a ward ( for " The Love Song of Laura Morrison " ) and has been a finalist for the Science Fiction Writers of America 's prestigious Nebula Award .
