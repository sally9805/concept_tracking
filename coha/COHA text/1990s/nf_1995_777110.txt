What Is Attention Deficit Disorder ? // Once you catch on to what this syndrome is all about , you 'll see it everywhere . People you used to think of as disorganized or manic or hyper or creative but unpredictable , people who you know could do more if they could just " get it together , " people who have bounced around in school or in their professional lives , people who have made it to the top but who still feel driven or disorganized , these may be people who in fact have attention deficit disorder . You may even recognize some of the symptoms in your own behavior . Many of the symptoms of ADD are so common to us all that for the term ADD to have specific meaning , rather than just be a scientific-sounding label for the complex lives we lead , we need to define the syndrome carefully . The best way to understand what ADD is  --  and what it is not  --  is to see how it affects the lives of people who have it . // In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations that appear in this book , one can wimess the struggles individuals faced to break through inaccurate labels and unfair judgments . As their stories unfold , a definition of ADD emerges . // Case 1 : Jim // It was eleven o'clock at night and Jim Finnegan was up pacing in his study . This was where he often found himself at night : alone , pacing , trying to get things together . Now approaching the halfway point of life , Jim was getting desperate . He looked around the room and took in the disorder . The room looked as if the contents of a bag lady 's shopping cart had been dumped into it . Books , papers , odd socks , old letters , a few half-smoked packages of Marlboros , and other loose ends lay scattered about , much like the bits and pieces of cognition that were strewn about in his mind . // Jim looked up at the to do list that was tacked to the corkboard above his desk . There were seventeen items , the final one circled several times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reorganization proposal due Tues. , 3/19 ! ! ! " This was Mon. , 3/18 . Jim had n't started on the proposal . He 'd been thinking about it for weeks , ever since he told his boss that he had a plan that would increase productivity , as well as morale , in the office . His boss had said fine , come up with a written proposal and we 'll see how it looks . His boss had also added a remark about how he hoped Jim would have enough " follow-through " to actually get something done this time . // Jim knew what he wanted to say . He 'd known for months what he wanted to say . The office needed a new computer system , and the men and women out front needed more authority so they could make decisions on the spot so everybody 's time would n't be wasted in unnecessary meetings . Efficiency would go up and morale would definitely improve . It was simple . Obvious . All the ideas were detailed on the various scraps of paper that dotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could do was pace . Where do I start ? he thought to himself . If it does n't come out right , I 'll look stupid , probably get fired . So what else is new ? Why should this job be any different ? Great ideas , no follow through . That 's me , good old Jim . He kicked the trash basket and added to the mess on the floor . OK , breathe in , breathe out , he told himself . // He sat down at his word processor and stared at the screen . Then he went over to his desk and began to straighten things up . The telephone rang and he barked at it , " Ca n't you see I 'm busy ? " When the answering machine came on , he heard Pauline 's voice : " Jim , I 'm going to sleep now . I just wanted to see how your proposal is coming . Good luck with it tomorrow . " He did n't have the heart to pick up the phone . // The night went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim off-line as he tried to clutch onto the task at hand . A cat would meow outside . He 'd think of something someone had said three days ago and wonder what they really meant by that . He 'd want a new pencil because the one he had felt heavy in his hand . Finally , he got down the words " A Proposal for Office Reorganization at Unger Laboratories . " Then nothing . " Just say what you want to say , " a friend had told him . OK , say what you want to say . But nothing came . He thought of a new job he wanted to apply for . Maybe I should just bag this and go to bed . Ca n't do that . No matter how bad it is , I 've got to finish this proposal . // By 4 A.M. he was beat . But not beaten . The words began to come . Somehow his extreme fatigue had lifted the censor in his mind and he found himself explaining his ideas simply and efficiently . By six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep before his meeting with his boss at nine . // The only trouble was that at nine he was still in bed , having forgotten to set the alarm before he went to sleep . When he arrived in a panic at the office at noon , he knew from the look on his boss 's face that no matter how good the proposal was , his days at Unger were over . " Why do n't you find a place with a little bit more flexibility ? " his boss said , and thanked him for his proposal . " You 're an idea man , Jim . Find a place that can accommodate to your style . " // " I do n't get it , " he said to Pauline over drinks several weeks later . " I know I have more to offer than getting myself fired every six months . But it 's always the same old story . Great ideas , but ca n't get it done . Even in high school , can you believe that ? The guidance counselor , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the highest IQ in the class , and so she just could n't figure out why I had such a hard time living up to my potential . " // " You know what 's not fair ? " Pauline said , turning the stem of her Manhattan glass between her thumb and forefinger . " They took the ideas in your proposal and used them . Dramatic improvement . Everybody 's happier and work is up . Those were your ideas , Jim , and you got fired . It 's not fair . " // " I do n't know what 's wrong with me , " Jim said . " I do n't know what to do . " // Jim had attention deficit disorder . When he came to see me at the age of thirty-two , he had been living a life of chronic underachievement , falling short of his goals both at work and in relationships because of an underlying neurological problem that made it difficult for him to pay attention , sustain effort , and complete tasks . // ADD is a neurological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distractibility , and hyperactivity or excess energy . About 15 million Americans have it today ; most of them do not know that they have it . The condition occurs in children and adults , men and women , boys and gifts , and it cuts across all ethnic groups , socioeconomic strata , levels of education , and degrees of intelligence . It used to be thought that this was a disorder of childhood alone , and that one outgrew it during adolescence . We now know that only about a third of the ADD population outgrows it ; two-thirds have it throughout adulthood . ADD is not a learning disability or a language disability or dyslexia , and it is not associated with low intelligence . In fact , many people who have ADD are very smart . It 's just that their smartness gets tangled up inside . Undoing the tangle to get a smooth run on the line can take more patience and perseverance than they can consistently bring to bear . // Where does the syndrome begin and normal behavior leave off ? What is impulsivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? These are the questions we will explore throughout this book , mainly in the context of individual cases , like Jim 's . Considering the symptoms , ca n't we all recoguize parts of ourselves ? Yes . However , one bases the diagnosis of ADD not on the mere presence of these symptoms , but on their severity and duration , and the extent to which they interfere with everyday life . // When Jim came for consultation , he was at wit 's end . He came into my office , sat down in one of the easy chairs , and began to run his fingers through his curly hair . He leaned forward , alternately looking at me or staring at the floor . " I do n't know where to begin . I do n't even know what I 'm doing here , " he said , shaking his head as if to say no , this wo n't help either . // " Did you have any trouble finding your way here ? " I asked . He was twenty minutes late , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , I did , " he said . " Your directions were fine , it was n't your fault . I just turned left where I should have turned right and then I was gonzo , school was out . It 's a miracle I got here at all . I ended up at some gas station in Somerville . " // " Well , it can be pretty confusing , " I said , hoping to let him relax a bit . Of the people who consult with me for problems related to ADD , probably about a half are either late for their first appointment or miss it altogether . I have come to expect it . It comes with the territory . My patients , however , usually feel very bad about it and so begin the session thinking that I am going to reprimand them in some way . " You certainly are n't the first person to get lost coming here , " I said . // " Really ? " he asked . " That 's good to hear . " He took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if the words had crowded in his throat , then let his breath out in a long sigh , the words apparently dispersed . He went through the same cycle a second time before I asked him if maybe he could use a few moments just to collect his thoughts while I wrote down some bits of information about him like his name , address , and telephone number . That seemed to help . " OK , " Jim said . " Let 's start . " // " OK , " I responded , leaning back in my chair , folding my hands behind my head . There was another long pause , and another sigh from Jim . " I can see that it 's hard for you to get started , " I said . " Maybe we could focus on what the problem is that brought you here . " // " Yes , " he said , " OK . " With that little bit of prodding from me , Jim began to fill in most of his history . A normal childhood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed for more detail , Jim acknowledged that he was quite rambunctious in grade school and enjoyed getting into mischief . He got good grades even though he never really studied . " I thought school was like playtime , " he said . But with high school , things got tougher . His innate intelligence could n't carry him so easily anymore , and he began to fall behind . He started to get lectures from his teachers and parents on his moral shortcomings , how he was letting himself and everyone else down , how in the long he 'd be the worse for it , and so forth . His self-esteem fell , although somehow his inborn temperament was buoyant enough to keep him fairly upbeat . After stumbling through college , he began a long series of jobs in various computer-related fields . // " You like computers ? " I asked . // " I could have invented them , " he said with great enthusiasm . " I love them . I just have this understanding of them , you know what I mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to get the most out of them . If only I could tell people what I know . If only I did n't screw up every time I get a chance  --  " // " How do you screw up ? " I asked . // " How do I screw up ? " he asked , then repeated the question again , turning it into a sorrowful statement by his tone of voice . " How do I screw up . I forget . I argue . I postpone . I procrastinate . I get lost . I get mad . I do n't follow through . You name it , I do it . I 'll get into these discussions with my boss , and I 'll see my way is right , and the next thing you know , I 'm calling him a stupid jerk for not seeing that I 'm right . Tends to get you fired , calling your boss a stupid jerk . Or I 'll have this idea , but I wo n't be able to find it , like it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in there , I know it 's in there , but I just ca n't get it out . I want to get it out , I try to get it out , but I ca n't . One of my old girlfriends told me before she left me that I should face it , I 'm just a loser . Maybe she 's right , I do n't know . " // " You cared about her ? " I asked . // " For a while . But then she got fed up , like all the rest have . I mean , I 'm pretty intense to be with . " // " Where do you think that intensity comes from ? " I asked . // " I do n't know , " he said . " It 's always been there , though . " // The longer we talked , the dearer it became how right Jim was , how the intensity had always been there , seldom harnessed , but always burning . That intensity may in part explain why ADD is common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commodities to any high-pressure , high-stimulus kind of work . " Have you ever consulted a psychiatrist before ? " I asked . // " A couple of times , " Jim said . " They were nice guys , but nothing really changed . One of them told me not to drink so much . " // " How much do you drink ? " // " I binge . When I really want to let loose , I go out and tie one on . It 's an old family tradition . My dad drank a lot . I guess you could say he was an alcoholic . I do n't think I 'm an alcoholic , but that 's what they all say , huh ? Anyway , I get these terrible hangovers the next day , so I do n't go back to it for a while . " // Often people with ADD self-medicate with alcohol or marijuana or cocaine . Cocaine , particularly , is similar to one of the medications used in the pharmacological treatment of ADD . // Jim began to cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you 're feeling restless , feel free to pace a bit while we talk , " I said . // " Really ? You do n't mind ? Thanks a lot . " He stood up and began to walk around , conducting his conversation with his arms as he spoke . " This is great . Most people would get unnerved if I did this , but I really think better when I walk . Is that weird ? No wonder I had trouble in school . You know , that 's half my problem . I 'm always so tied up inside . And you can imagine it does n't go over big at work if I want to pace half the time . " // " I do n't know , " I said . " Maybe you just have n't found the right job . " // " You sound like all my bosses . Is there a right job for me ? " // ADD comes in many shapes and sizes . In many people , particularly adults , the symptoms of ADD are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gambling or drinking , and the underlying ADD is never detected . In other people the symptoms take on a particular cast , congruent with the person 's personality as it evolves over time , so that the symptoms are never really noticed the way symptoms of a cold or flu might be but rather are dismissed as being part of " just the way he is , " not warranting medical or psychiatric intervention . And within the domain of properly diagnosed ADD there is also much variability . Jim 's ADD , I was discovering , was the high-energy , hyperactive type . But there is another kind of ADD that shows no hyperactivity whatsoever . Indeed , these people can be underactive . This is the child , often a girl , who sits at the back of the classroom daydreaming , or the adult who moves serenely within a cloud , never quite present anywhere . // " I do n't know if there is a right job for you , " I said , coming back to Jim 's question . " For now I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ever really told it before ? " // " No . Nobody can follow me . I go off on too many tangents , they all say . " // " Well , you just keep talking , and let me do the organizing . That 's what I 'm paid for . " // Jim talked for a long while , over weeks . He told many stories of misunderstanding , miscommunication , self-reproach , underachievement , missed chances , angry people , and risky behavior . It often seemed , as his mother had told him when he was twelve , that he simply did n't know enough to come in out of the rain . He 'd do foolish things , forget , and dillydally all the time . But he also told stories of adventure , and kindness , of intuition and charm and energy and enthusiasm . He told stories of big dreams and high hopes and big disappointments as well . Baffled and frustrated , he never blamed anyone but himself . He was a very likable guy , even though he did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case with so many people who have ADD . They are very likable , although they get into the most difficult of patches . They can be exasperating in the extreme  --  one mother called me about her son , who had ADD and had just inadvertently almost set fire to his school , and asked me if she could run over him in her truck  --  but they can also be unusually empathic , intuitive , and compassionate , as if in that tangled brain circuitry there is a special capacity to see into people and situations . // Jim 's story took us through many twists and turns . There was the time he had a job as a bus driver : one dreamy afternoon doing his regular run he made what he thought was his last stop and headed home for the bus yard only to pull into the lot with a bus half-full of confused and angry customers . He had forgotten to make the actual final stop on the line . " Where are we ? " the passengers demanded . " Where have you taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bus company . Or there was the time in conversation with a female colleague when he referred to his boss as a " pinhead , " only to realize almost as he was saying it that the female colleague was his boss 's wife . " I do n't do it on purpose , " . he said . " I just put my foot in my mouth . I do n't think about who I 'm talking to or where I am . Is it my unconscious wish to fail ? " // " It could be , " I said . " That sort of thing has been known to happen . On the other hand , it could be something completely different . " I began to tell Jim about ADD . " You see , it might be that you 're not a screw-up or a loser at all , and that you do not have an unconscious wish to sabotage yourself . It might be , and it is beginning to sound to me as if this is very much the case , that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no more a thing to be ashamed of than being nearsighted is . In fact , it 's sort of like being nearsighted . You do n't focus very well . You have to strain to see clearly . People with ADD have trouble attending to one task at a time . You 've probably heard of hyperactive children , and that was how this syndrome was originally described  --  hyperactivity in kids . We now know that the symptoms include more than just hyperactivity and that it affects adults as well as children . The hallmark symptoms of ADD are easy distractibility , impulsivity , and sometimes , but not always , hyperactivity or excess energy . These people are on the go . Type A personalities . Thrill seekers . High-energy- , action-oriented- , bottom-line- , gotta-nm-type people . They have lots of projects going simultaneously . They 're always scrambling . They procrastinate a lot and they have trouble finishing things . Their moods can be quite unstable , going from high to low in the bat of an eye for no apparent reason . They can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when making transitions . Their memories are porous . They daydream a lot . They love high-stimulus situations . They love action and novelty . Just as this kind of problem can get in the way at work , it can also interfere with close relationships . Your girlfriend can get the wrong impression if you 're constantly tuning out or going for fast action . " // As I explained to Jim what attention deficit disorder was , I watched him . He leaned forward in his chair and looked right at me . He began to nod his head at the mention of each new symptom . An excited look came over the face that had been so harried when we first met . " When . I was a kid , " he broke in , " it was always ' Earth to Jim ! ' or ' Where 's Jim ? ' or ' Jim , why do n't you just shape up ? ' My parents and my teachers just thought I was lazy . So I would get punished or yelled at . For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of began to agree with them . I mean , what can you do ? My dad had a way of smacking me across the side of my head if I talked back . It was kind of brutal , come to think of it . So I do n't think of it much . I have to wonder , though , what kept me going . I mean , I never lost my spunk . I remember a teacher in the sixth grade making me copy pages out of a geography textbook because I had lost my homework . She said if I would admit I just had n't done the homework instead of lying and saying I 'd lost it , she would n't make me copy the pages . Well , I had done the damn homework , so I was not about to say I had n't . Well , she got ticked off and really lost it . She got into this thing where she kept upping the ante , assuming I would back down . She kept adding on pages for me to copy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stayed up all night copying those pages , and I would have reached the hundred pages if my mother had n't found me in the middle of the night . She made me stop . Plus she went into school the next day and raised a big stink . Old Miss Willmott had to apologize to me . To me ! It was the most satisfying moment of my entire educational career , bar none , and I 'll always love my mother for it . " // " But I wish they had known then what you are telling me now , " Jim went on . " There were so many stories . My whole ninth-grade year was like one long war with my parents . They got into the same thing Miss Willmott did , always upping the ante . Their basic idea was that I was n't trying hard enough , so they kept coming up with more and more punishments , none of which worked . It makes me kind of sick to think back on it . It was n't my parents ' fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why did n't anybody tell me about this before ? " Jim finally asked me in exasperation . // " People have n't really known about it very much until fairly recently , " I answered . // It ca n't be said when ADD came into existence . The fidgety , overactive child has been around , one may presume , for as long as children have been around . And they have not been treated well . // The treatment of children has been terrible throughout history , one of the consistent but little-mentioned black marks in almost every epoch of human civilization ; people have seldom differentiated much when it comes to children who behaved " badly . " Too often , it was simply recommended that these children be beaten , or in some cases , killed . There is something in the most inhumane part of human nature that enjoys hurting smaller and weaker beings , particularly if they annoy us or make demands on us . It is beyond the scope of this book to document the abuse of children that mars human history ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has often been the overactive children , the ADD kids , who have been subjected to the worst abuse . It is only recently that we have conferred upon children rights beyond those of animals and decided to look upon their " misbehavior " as possibly signifying something other than satanic possession or a moral infirmity deserving punishment . // So it is not surprising that although the syndrome we now call ADD has been around for centuries , it was simply lumped together with all other " bad behaviors . " It was not until this century that it began to be recognized as a medical condition . Although it is hard to say who first defined the syndrome , credit usually goes to British pediatrician George Frederic Still , who , in a series of lectures to the Royal College of Physicians in 1902 , described some children in his medical practice who were difficult to control , showing signs of " lawlessness , " lacking " inhibitory volition , " and in general being obstreperous , dishonest , and willful . He hypothesized that the condition was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather was biologically inherited or due to injury at birth . // The theme of injury at birth and brain damage continued in the thirties and forties in the idea of the " brain-injured child . " Even When no actual evidence of neurological impairment could be found , " brain damage " was invoked to explain uncontrollable behavior . It was during these decades that stimulant medication ( amphetamine ) was first tried , successfully , to help contain the behavior of some of these children . // Other terms began to appear , some quite descriptive , such as " organic drivenness , " others rather amorphous and bleak , like " minimal brain dysfunction . " One had to wonder whether the brain itself was minimal or the dysfunction was minimal or perhaps whether the understanding of what was happening in the first place was minimal . // Separating the symptom of hyperactivity from any notion of brain damage , Stella Chess in 1960 and others around the same time began to write about the " hyperactive child syndrome . " Chess saw the symptoms as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in biology rather than the environment . // By the 1970s many major researchers were investigating the syndrome of hyperactivity . Virginia Douglas , in Canada , began to look broadly at the symptoms associated with hyperactivity and found four major traits to account for the clinical picture : ( 1 ) deficits in attention and effort , ( 2 ) impulsivity , ( 3 ) problems in regulating one 's level of arousal , and ( 4 ) the need for immediate reinforcement . In large part due to her work , in 1980 the syndrome was renamed attention deficit disorder . // In the decade since that time , research has ballooned . Probably the most up-to-date and definitive account of the history and current state of the field is to be found in a book written by one of the great researchers in the area , Russell Barkley ; his book is entitled , simply , Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder . // " So what does it mean , exactly ? " Jim asked me . " Does it mean I 'm stupid ? " // " Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You tell me . Are you stupid ? " I asked . // " No , I 'm not . I know I 'm not , " he said emphatically . " I 've just had this trouble all my life of getting out what 's inside . " // " Exactly , " I said . ' That can be due to a lot of different things in different people , but in your case I think it 's due to ADD . " // " Is it common ? " he asked . // " Probably fifteen million people in this country have it , both children and adults . It affects males more than females , probably in a ratio of about three to one . We do n't know what causes it exactly , but the best evidence is genetic . Other factors may contribute , like problems at birth , but genetics is the main cause . Environmental factors can make it a lot worse , but they do n't cause it . " // " You mean my mother did n't screw me up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this case . Maybe in other ways , who knows . Do you want to blame her ? " // " No , no . But I want to blame someone . Not blame someone , I just want to get mad . It really pisses me off that no one told me about this before . If this is just the way I 'm wired  --  " // " Then , " I interrupted , " you do n't have to blame yourself . " // " Who is , of course , the person I 've been blaming all along . But it is my fault , is n't it ? I mean it does n't matter whether I 've got ADD or XYZ  --  if I 've messed up , I 've messed up and at my age there 's no one but me to take the heat . Right ? " // " In a way , I guess , " I said , rubbing my shoulder as if his words had activated an old ache . " But what 's to gain in all the blame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself in such a way you can forgive yourself and move on . " // " OK , " Jim said , " I get what you 're saying . What 's the bottom line , though ? Is there anything you can do for this ? " // " ADD people love bottom lines , " I answered , laughing . " It 's always , ' Get to the point ' ; ' What 's the next show ? ' ; ' Where 's the beef ? ' " // " Yeah , you 're right , " he said . ' Tm not big on scenery . I want to get there . Is that bad ? " // " I did n't mean to put you on the defensive . I have ADD myself . I know how it feels . " // " You have ADD ? " Jim asked , apparently taken aback . " You seem so calm . " // " Practice , " I said , smiling . " Actually , I 'm sure for you there are times when you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this kind of work is one of those times . But the practice part is true also , and we 'll get into that . " // From this point Jim 's treatment began . Actually , it had begun already . Just finding out about the syndrome , finding at last that there is a name for it , constitutes a large part of the treatment for most people . // " What is it with me ? " he asked in one session . " I do n't mean to be rude . But this guy calls me up and he starts to tell me the materials I sent him were the wrong ones , when I knew perfectly well they were the right ones , he just did n't know why they were the right ones , and so he thought they were the wrong ones , and so immediately that started to annoy me , but it was n't even that that got to me , it was his tone of voice . Can you believe it ? I knew from the first second he started on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or punch him . " // " You had like a rage reaction , " I offered . // " Damn straight . And when I think about it now , I get mad all over again . So I tried to do what you said . Pause . Think of the consequences . This was a good customer . I did n't want to lose him and I did n't want him bad-mouthing me to his friends . So I paused . But the more I paused , the more he talked on , in this really slow , dumb voice , on and on , and ! wahted to scream at him , ' Get to the point ! ' So instead , I just cleared my throat . But then he said to me , ' Do n't interrupt me , I 'm not finished . ' Well , I lost it . I told him I thought we could be on the phone until next Christmas and he still would n't be finished and I had better things to do and I hung up . Can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you did very well . At least up until you lost it . The guy was pushing your buttons . And let 's face it , there are going to be times where you 're going to get annoyed and you 're going to lose it . Treatment for ADD wo n't take that away completely , and you would n't want it to , would you ? " // " I guess not . But is this part of ADD , this rage reaction , as you call it ? " // " Yes , " I said . " It 's part of the impulsivity . If you think of ADD as a basic problem with inhibition , it helps explain how ADD people get angry quicker . They do n't inhibit their impulses as well as other people . They lack the little pause between impulse and action that allows most people to be able to stop and think . Treatment helps with that but it does n't cure it completely . " // " You know what the funny thing was ? " he asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he was sorry we had developed a communication problem between us the day before and maybe we could start over . A communication problem , can you believe that ? I said sure , only let me start this time . I explained to him in ten seconds why what I had sent him was what he needed , he said he understood and said thank you , I said , ' No , it is me who should thank you , I 'm sorry for our communication problem yesterday , ' and we said goodbye , best of friends . " Jim slapped his knee . // " How do you like that ? " I said . " Your guardian angel must have been on duty . " // " But where does it come from , this anger ? " // " Can you tell me ? " I asked . // " I think it 's built up over the years . When I was a little kid , I was all over the place , but I was n't angry . I think it built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the frustration . " Jim clenched his fists without knowing it as he talked about his feelings . " It got so I knew before I started something it was n't going to work out . So all I had left was tenacity . I would n't give up . But , damn , why did n't I , with all the screw-ups I had to show for my efforts ? " // Jim was beginning to get into what is a large and very important part of ADD , although , strictly speaking , it is not part of the neurological syndrome itself . He was starting to talk about the secondary psychological problems that typically develop in the wake of the primary neurological problem of ADD . // Due to repeated failures , misunderstandings , mislabelings , and all manner of other emotional mishaps , children with ADD usually develop problems with their self-image and self-esteem . Throughout childhood , at home and at school they are told they are defective . They are called dumb , stupid , lazy , stubborn , willful , or obnoxious . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " out in left field " all the time . They are blamed for the chaos of family mealtimes or the disaster of family vacations . They are reprimanded for classroom disturbances of all sorts and they are easily scapegoated at school . They are the subject of numerous parent-teacher conferences . Time and again , an exasperated teacher meets a frustrated parent in a meeting that later explodes all over the child who is n't there . He feels the shock waves afterward . " Do you know what your teacher said ? Do you know how embarrassed your mother and I were ? " Or , from the teacher , " I understand you have no greater control of yourself at home than you do in school . We must work on this , must n't we ? " // Month after month , year after year , the tapes of negativity play over and over again until they become the voice the child knows best . " You 're bad , " they say in many different ways . " You 're dumb . You just do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You really are pathetic . " This voice pulls the child 's self-esteem down and down , out of the reach of the helping hands that might be extended , into the private world of adolescent self-reproach . Liking yourself in adolescence is hard enough work for any child . But for the child with ADD it is especially difficult . // " You kept up your efforts , but it must have been tough , " I said to Jim . // " It sure was , " he responded with a kind of ruefulness in his voice that said to me , You do n't know the half of it . " // " Tell me about it , " I said . // " It 's just that I would n't know where to begin . By high school they almost had me convinced I was just plain stupid . I mean , I could n't figure it out . I could understand the stuff in class . I could follow what was said . I could even jump ahead in my mind . But when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or taking tests , everything just went out the window . I would try . Believe me , I would try . I got lectures all the time on how I did n't try , but I did try . It 's just that the bigger sledge hammer did n't work . I 'd lock myself in my room and before you knew it I was gone . Doing something else . Reading . Listening to music . Then I 'd catch myself and try and get to studying again , but goddamn it , it just did n't work . " Jim 's voice got harsh and his face turned red . // " It all comes back , huh , " I said . // " It sure does . They 'd tell me to try harder . Over and over again . Try harder . And I 'd try harder and it would n't work . After a while ! figured I did n't have the brain to do it . And at the same time I knew I did . But it just did n't work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . No wonder you felt angry . " // " Do you think that 's why I started drinking ? I felt better after I had a few pops . But doesnin my mind .

Over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harder and it would n't work . After a while ! figured I did n't have the brain to do it . And at the same time I knew I did . But it just did n't work out . " // " So you were frustrated all the time . No wonder you felt angry . " // " Do you think that 's why I started drinking ? I felt better after I had a few pops . But does n't everybody ? " // " Sure , " I said . " But it is likely that you had special reasons to drink . You were medicating yourself , as so many people with ADD do . Alcohol , marijuana , cocaine are all common . In different ways each of those drugs calms you down . But only in the short run . In the long run , they can all be disastrous . " // " I think I knew that . I think that 's why I never let myself develop a regular habit . I thought that would really be the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocaine ? I thought that juiced you up . " // " It does for most people . For people with ADD , however , it helps them focus . So , without knowing it , when they use cocaine they are medicating themselves . " // " No kidding . Anyway , I 'm just glad ! found out about this before I let my whole life get away . " // " How did it affect your relationships with other people ? " I asked . " I did n't think about it at the time , but all the things we 've been talking about got in the way with friends and girls and everyone else . I would n't listen  --  " // " Could n't listen , " I corrected him . // " OK , could n't . But everybody else thought would n't . I 'd be late for things , or I would n't show up at all , having forgot . I would n't hear things tight , so I would n't respond right  --  you know the story . People thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did have a short fuse , that much was true . When someone would call me on something , I 'd just tell them to kiss off . Did n't make me real popular . But still I had friends . Most important of all , Pauline stuck with me . Sometimes I wonder why . I would forget things , not show up , get angry or depressed for no reason . I 'd be talking to her , and then I would disappear into some daydream . I 'd promise to do something with her , and then I would forget . Somehow , she did n't dump me . But it sure was n't easy . We always seemed to be in the midst of some potential argument . There 's always been a fight waiting to happen . When I would screw up at work , she offered encouragement , but I could tell she was thinking , What is it with this guy ? I was thinking the same thing . I do n't think I could have survived this long without Pauline . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her . I 'm just not an easy guy . I know that . I know I 'm exasperating . I 'm exasperating to myself . I wish to hell I were n't . Believe me , I 'm not like this on purpose . I think Pauline believes that , too , deep down . Otherwise how could she have stuck with me ? " // " She probably does . But you 're a good guy , Jim . People put up with your annoying habits because you made it worth their while in other ways . " // An important , and often overlooked part of both learning disabilities and ADD is the social consequence of having them . ADD can interfere with one 's interpersonal life just as dramatically as it does with one 's academic or job performance . To make friends , you have to be able to pay attention . To get along in a group , you have to be able to follow what is being said in the group . Social cues are often subtle : the narrowing of eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of voice , a tilting of the head . Often the person with ADD does n't pick up on these cues . This can lead to real social gaffes or a general sense of being out of it . Particularly in childhood , where social transactions happen so rapidly and the transgressor of norms is dealt with so pitilessly , a lapse in social awareness due to the distractibility or impulsivity of ADD can preclude acceptance by a group or deny understanding from a friend . // " I sometimes wonder how I made it this far without getting killed , " Jim laughed . " Must be the luck of the Irish . " // " Could be , " I said . " But maybe you learned little tricks along the way without even knowing it . In a sense , having ADD was part of your ethnicity , too . It defined how you were , what was in your bones , just as much as your Irish heritage did , but in different ways . " // Jim 's treatment lasted about a year . It included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medication . The psychotherapy was more like coaching than traditional psychotherapy in that it was educational , informative , directive , and explicitly encouraging . I cheered Jim on from the sidelines . I helped him build a new understanding of himself , taking into account his ADD , and I helped him build ways of organizing and structuring his life so that ADD would n't get in the way so much . The medication helped him focus and stay on task . As he put it , it took the static out of the broadcast . // We will discuss treatment in detail in chapter 8 , but as an introduction , here is a synopsis of the most effective components of treatment . Note that while the medications used for ADD can provide remarkable help , they are not the whole treatment by any means . A comprehensive program works best . // SYNOPSIS OF TREATMENT OF ADD // 1 . Diagnosis : The first step in treatment is making the diagnosis . Often this carries with it considerable relief as the individual feels , " At last there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the diagnosis . // 2 . Education : The more one can learn about ADD , the more successful the therapy will be . A thorough understanding of what ADD is allows you to better understand where ADD affects your life and what to do about it . It also allows you to take the key step of explaining it to other people . // 3 . Structuring : Structure refers to the external limits and controls people with ADD so urgently need . Such concrete , practical tools as lists , reminders , simple filing systems , appointment books , goals , daily planning , and the like can greatly reduce the inner chaos of an ADD life and improve productivity as well as one 's sense of control . // 4 . Coaching and/or Psychotherapy : The person with ADD will greatly benefit from having a " coach , " someone standing on the sidelines with a whistle around his neck calling out encouragement , instructions , and reminders , and in general helping to keep things going on task . People with ADD thrive with this sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Group therapy can provide this most excellently . Traditional psychotherapy may also be indicated if depression , problems with self-esteem , or other internal problems exist . // 5 . Medication : There are several medications that can help correct many of the symptoms of ADD . The medication works like a pair of eyeglasses , helping the individual to focus . It can also reduce the sense of inner turmoil and anxiety that is so common with ADD . The medication works by correcting a chemical imbalance of neurotransmitters that exists in ADD in the parts of the brain that regulate attention , impulse control , and mood . While medication is not the whole answer , it can provide profound relief , and when it is used properly , it is very safe . // In Jim 's case treatment went very well . By the time we parted company , he had changed his life . Within eight months he began to put together his own computer consulting business , specializing in some kind of software manipulation I never did understand , but one that few others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business grew . Being his own boss , he did n't have the kinds of troubles with superiors he 'd had before . Of course , he did have to relate appropriately with clients , and this was a skill he worked on . He settled into his relationship with Pauline in a way that pleased them both . He had developed a series of techniques for managing himself , as he put it . No longer shooting himself in the foot , he was beginning to make use of the creative brain he 'd always had . // Case 2 : Carolyn // Carolyn Deauville came to see me one afternoon , " just to chat . " When she made the appointment , she told me over the phone , long distance , in her rich southern accent , " Honey , I know what I 've got . I just want you to sit there and nod and listen . " // Carolyn strode into my office , all five feet ten inches of her , wearing a pastel orange chiffon dress with a white sash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lipstick and smelled of a perfume that immediately filled the room , very pleasantly , but not subtly . Like her perfume , Carolyn filled the room quickly . " You do n't mind if I do this ? " she asked , lighting up a Vantage . Exhaling smoke , she opened her blue eyes wide and looked fight at me . " I feel like we 're old friends . I 've heard you speak . I 've read some of your articles . We both have ADD . I 'm a therapist , you 're a therapist . Lord , we 're practically neighbors . Except I 'm from three thousand miles away in California . " // " California ? " I asked . " I would have guessed  --  " // " From my accent , you would have guessed somewhere in the South , and you would have been fight , since I grew up in New Orleans . But marriage number two took me to the Golden Gate , and I 've never been back . " // " You said on the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been a psychologist for twenty years now and I 've been specializing in ADD for the past ten . I 've never told anyone my story , and I thought you 'd be a good person to start with , since I liked you from the way you talked . " // We agreed to have a few appointments . She was in town with her husband at a convention for his business . She 'd be here a few days . // As her story unfolded , I had to marvel at her resilience and ingenuity . " I 'm an orphan , or at least I used to be . My mother got pregnant and Catholic teenage girls in Louisiana in the thirties did n't have abortions . So here I am . I was adopted when I was two . What a mismatch my mother and I were . She was a wonderful lady and I love her dearly , but she was so ladylike and organized , and I , well , I was n't . My mama could n't civilize me , try as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit my nails , I let my skirt ride up , I got dirty all the time , I was a real pigpen . My first vivid memory is running away from Summation Bible School at age four . It was so boring . Jimmy Tundooras and I tiptoed out the back door and ran down the dirt road toward the river . After a little while Jimmy got scared and went back , but not me . I wandered all over town until I fell down asleep . They found me late that afternoon in a ditch by the side of the road . Did Mama give me what for . Must 've wondered why she ever went to that orphanage . // " My next best memory is sitting on top of the water tower . Must not have been a day over six . Once I learned how to climb up to the top of that tower , I did it all the time . Sometimes , after I learned to read , I 'd put a book in my teeth and climb up and sit all afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past a water tower today , I shiver . They 're very high ! Back then I remember dangling my feet over the side and looking down and saying , ' O-o-o-o-e-e-e. ' " // " Did n't anybody tell you not to go up there ? I asked . // " Nobody knew I did , " she answered in a whisper , as if it were supposed to remain secret to this day . " Oh , I was a devil of a kid , or so Mama said , but she loved me , too . It 's just that I was always into things . Saturdays . I hated Saturdays . Some inexplicable uneasiness would come over me on Saturdays . I did n't know why then , but looking back I can see that it was because on Saturday all my sins of the week would be discovered . Mama was a schoolteacher and too busy to notice during the week , but come Saturday she 'd inspect my clothes and find that one white cotton glove I needed for church was missing , or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my dress . Or that a bunch of clothes were missing . I was in the habit of giving away clothes to the kids at the orphanage . I did n't know that I was adopted , so I do n't know why I gave my clothes away , but I did . Mama would despair . " // " And your father ? " I asked . // " Daddy was like the pied piper . He loved children , and he loved me . Which was lucky , because I needed all the love I could get . Especially after I started school and after Warren was born . After all the trouble Mama had getting pregnant , what does she do but produce a menopause baby , Warren , my brother . He was an angel as much as I was a devil . They might as well have put a halo over his head . And school ? Well , my first memory of school is getting spanked by Mrs. Kimble for not being able to lie still on my pallet . I never did lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was slow to learn how to read , but once I did , I was a voracious reader . Little Women , The Secret Garden , Hans Brinker  --  these were my books . On top of the water tower , under the kitchen table , wherever I could find a spot to be left alone , I 'd tug a book out of my pocket and read . Math was a disaster . They had flash cards , and one student would pass them out to all of us . I used to save my dessert to bribe whoever was doing the passing out to give me the easy cards . I especially liked the zero cards , one plus zero equals ... ? I always despaired when they had a dessert I could n't sequester in my pocket or under my dress , like pudding . Even pie I got pretty good at hiding . " // " You do sound like a happy kid , in spite of it all , " I said . // " I was . I 've always been happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckiest thing in the world . Even when I had every reason not to be , I was happy . I always found a way . Once , in second grade , I was being punished for having smacked Nancy Smitt by being told to stand behind a table away from the other kids . This was on a morning parents were coming through to visit , so it was supposed to be particularly embarrassing and humiliating for me to have to stand off to the side behind this table . Well , what did I do ? The table came about up to my midsection , so I just robbed up against it and let my mind drift away as everybody passed through . I 'm sure no one noticed , and I 'm sure I hardly even knew that I was masturbating right there in public view in the second-grade classroom . // " I always did talk too much , " Carolyn said , as if she thought she still did . But I did n't think so . I loved hearing her story , particularly the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thickest and softest southern voice . " The hardest thing about it all was getting teased so much . I was so reactive . All my emotions were on the surface . Someone would make a face at me , and I 'd stick my tongue out right back . Someone would whisper something about me , and I 'd jump on their back . Also , I cried really easily . Someone would hurt my feelings , and boohoo , the tears would come . Well , you know how kids hone in on that . So I was always getting teased . Daddy would coach me on how to ignore it , but I never could . In third grade I beat up two boys on the playground , and that was at a time when girls simply did not fight , let alone fight boys . Mama was mortified , but Daddy took me aside and told me he was proud . // " Poor Mama , she got mortified a lot . In sixth grade my teacher got so fed up with looking at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gum , a bent fork , and even old desserts  --  that she took a few brown paper bags and emptied it all for me to take home to show my mother after school . Mama was mortified once again . // " She tried so hard to make me be a lady . I wanted to peroxide my hair , but she said no . What did I do ? I was such a slob . I took lipstick and tried to streak my hair with that instead . It just became a greasy mess . I was forever stuffing my chest with rolled-up socks . Except I did n't do that very skillfully either . One day a sock popped out of my dress in tenth-grade science class . You can imagine the reaction . // " Somehow , though , I got through . All my reading must have paid off , because I scored high on achievement tests and got a scholarship to college . At the time , I was amazed I did so well on the tests , as was everybody else . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I know , I think I did well because I was so motivated I went into one of those hyperfocused states people with ADD can go into . For once Mama was n't mortified . And I scraped my way through college and got into graduate school , which I did part-time since I was having babies . Then I quit school completely for a few years before going back and finishing my Ph.D . and becoming the woman you see sitting before you now . " // " You never knew you had attention deficit disorder ? " I asked . // " Never . Not until I diagnosed myself well after graduate school . What do you think ? Do I fit the picture ? " // " Yes , you surely do , " I said . " How did you feel when you discovered you 'd had ADD all along ? " // " Just this huge relief . At last there was a name for it , especially all the emotional reactivity that got me teased so much . I had thought I was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The not sitting still , the going up the water tower , the fights , being a mess , having trouble in school . Things fit into place . The best thing was getting a name for it . I 'd pretty much figured out how to handle it by the time I found out I had it . " // " Why did you want to see me ? " I asked . // " To get a second opinion , " she said . " I 've only had myself to confirm my diagnosis . " // " Well , " I said , " it sounds like pretty classic ADD to me . We could get some testing to get further confirmation . But you could have done that already . And I think you know you have ADD . Are you sure there is n't some other reason you came here ? " I asked . // Carolyn , who had told her story virtually without missing a beat or coming up for air , paused . She took her hat off , which revealed her whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she shook out her light brown hair . Tall , elegant , secure , she surprised me by what she said next . " I wanted you to tell me I 'd done a good job , " she said softly . " That sounds infantile , I 'm sure , but you ca n't imagine what an effort it 's been . Actually , I thought perhaps you would know how much it 's taken , since you see so many people like me. " // " Not many people like you , " I said . " You never got any help along the way and you 've overcome your obstacles just by intuition and persistence . You 've done an amazing job , Carolyn . You 've done very well . You should feel proud . " // " Thank you , " she said . " I needed to hear that from someone who really knew . " // Carolyn 's story is remarkable in some ways and representative in others . As a child , her symptoms were typical : hyperactivity , thrill-seeking , trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also had many of the positive qualities that are often not mentioned when one hears about ADD : spunk , resilience , persistence , charm , creativity , and hidden intellectual talent . What was remarkable was that she was able to develop her talents without any special help . She did not get buried under the teasing she received ; she did not lose her positive sense of who she was , or who she could be . In many ways the most dangerous aspect of undiagnosed and untreated ADD is the assault to self-esteem that usually occurs . Whatever talents these people may have , they often never get to use them because they give up , feeling lost and stupid . Carolyn is a wonderful example of someone who prevailed . // Case 3 : Maria // Maria Berlin came to me for a consultation after reading a piece in the newspaper about ADD in adults . " I did n't know there was such a thing , " she said , crossing her legs at the calf as she settled back into my overstuffed office couch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I started to wonder . " // " Tell me a little about yourself , " I said . It is always hard to know where to jump in when I meet a patient for the first time . There is a standard way of taking a history  --  name , address , presenting problem , and so forth  --  but that can be overly structured and not give the person the chance to say what they really want to say . So I usually //
