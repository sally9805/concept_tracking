Our minds drift back and forth between the sacred and the mundane : between our ideas , our myths about ourselves , on one hand , and on the other our everyday , mortal disorder , our contradictions , our injustices and our need for the law . In the borderland between the two realms we encounter the dangerous , interesting kingdom of lies . <P> It was 10 years ago that the three realms intersected in the Hudson River town of Wappingers Falls , N.Y . There , Tawana Brawley , a black teenager , proclaimed that a gang of white law officers had abducted and held her for four days in the woods , raping her repeatedly , writing KKK and NIGGER on her belly , smearing her with dog feces and leaving her in a plastic garbage bag outside an apartment complex where her family had once lived . Inconveniently , a witness at that apartment complex had glanced out a window and seen Tawana furtively installing herself in the garbage bag . And a grand jury , after a long , hard look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real world that the story was true . <P> As lies go , it was n't a very good one . To anyone who ever raised a child , Tawana 's story had the unmistakable ring of a whopper  --  an extreme example of a script that a desperate 15-year-old might well invent if , like Tawana , she had gone AWOL for a few days and needed to deflect a feared stepfather 's wrath . <P> But some stories are so deeply embedded in a culture that like black holes , they have the power to overwhelm and devour lesser tales that stray into their fierce field of gravity . Tawana 's narrative  --  a messy , lesser tale that in a society uncontaminated by race hate would have been universally dismissed as a hoax  --  merged with deeper American memories of race and rape and lynching ( the mobs sometimes made up of white law officers ) . Tawana 's lie claimed the prestige of tragic precedent and a legacy of sacred indignation . Tawana became indistinguishable in moral terms from , say , Emmett Till , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for daring to get fresh with a white woman . <P> Who was the victim in the Tawana Brawley case ? Tawana ? It was such a parenthetical sadness  --  though also a stroke of cunning  --  that she was led to such a degrading fantasy , herself as garbage . But the unambiguous casualty was a white assistant prosecutor from Dutchess County named Steven Pagones . Tawana 's was not a harmless lie . Once the story went public , it attracted three professional race men named C. Vernon Mason , Alton Maddox and Al Sharpton , lawyers who arrived to work as Tawana 's handlers and to demagogue the case in the media . The three identified Pagones as one of the white rapists . Pagones has spent 10 years trying to clear his name . <P> We seek patterns . Politicians , commentators and storytelling media ( movies , television ) give us myths ; to supervise everyday chaos , we need the law , especially in the borderland of lies . Last week the law did its work : a jury vindicated Pagones . It found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The jurors then withdrew to consider how much to assess in damages .
