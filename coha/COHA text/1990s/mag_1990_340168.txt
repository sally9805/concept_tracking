When Ingvar Carlsson , Sweden 's Social Democratic Prime Minister , entered the chambers of parliament last week , he was convinced that he brought with him the cure to the country 's economic woes , which are many . Banks had been closed for almost three weeks in a bitter strike and lockout ; wages have risen 28% since 1986 ; and inflation gallops ahead at an estimated 9% . Carlsson 's plan was painful : a two-year freeze on rents , wages and prices and arbitration to prevent strikes . After several hours of heated debate , the five opposition parties united to defeat Carlsson 's bill . The final vote : 190 to 153 . The Prime Minister resigned immediately . <P> If various parties can not put together a new coalition , an election will have to be called . In the meantime , banks planned to reopen this week following a settlement that gives workers a 13.5% wage hike .
