The sea speaks in many voices . On that first morning after the explosion of TWA Flight 800 , amid the overwhelming stench of burning jet fuel and the plane 's charred remains , hundreds of letters floated on the surface of the Atlantic , unanchored memories of diplomats , designers , doctors and teenagers . A postcard of the Statue of Liberty had become an interrupted souvenir , an image of the monument born in France that never made its way home . Out of a camera bag fished from the waste came a list in pencil , in what seemed to be a young girl 's handwriting . Amy : light pink , size 8 . Corry : dress . Steph : orange or hunter green  --  the plan for a spree in Paris , transformed into a haiku of loss . And somewhere lost in the waters too is an unuttered promise , a diamond ring to accompany a proposal to a lover who must now long for the rest of her life . The miasma off the beaches of New York was the cruelest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead with the terror and fears of the living . <P> " My mother , I came to see if my mother was on the plane , " said a stunned young man , clutching a companion 's hand at New York 's John F. Kennedy International Airport . Police whisked him across the street , where he was shown a piece of paper held by an official . The official nodded yes , creating yet another mourner for the 230 people who died off Long Island last week . What killed them ? A mechanical malfunction ? A technical failure had once sent another hardy Boeing 747 crashing into a Japanese mountain , killing more than 500 people . But this 747 had burst into flames 13,700 ft. in the air . What accident could have caused such a swift and merciless catastrophe ? <P> In the 24 hours after the disaster , experts were already speculating about a powerful bomb that may have found its way onto the plane or of people yet unknown who may have launched a small missile against the airliner from a vantage point as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ifs loudly iterated and " theory " worn like a reluctant fig leaf . Yet by Friday , there were indications that the Federal Government was weighing a decision to order stringent security directives not before seen in peacetime to all U.S. airlines , which would leave little doubt that the fall of TWA Flight 800 was deliberate terror . If the plane was sabotaged , the disaster becomes America 's third milestone on a forced march into a demonic dimension , even as the country had been preparing to soar to Olympic heights . If the 230 who died last week were murdered , then the toll of terror is escalating precipitously : six people died in the bombing of the World Trade Center in 1993 ; 168 in the Oklahoma City attack in 1995 . And as it waits for the sea to give up its mysteries , America sifts the wreckage for clues to the crime , reassembling the plane and its people , and in doing so , hoping to disperse its grief . <P> STRANGERS ON A PLANE         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
