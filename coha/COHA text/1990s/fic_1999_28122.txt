Part One WITH A LITTLE EFFORT , anything can be shown to connect with anything else : existence is infinitely cross-referenced . And everything has more than one definition . A cat is a mammal , a narcissist , a companion , a riddle . I 've been reading T. S. Eliot again , the nice hardback edition of his poems that Roberta gave me before she left . I 'd almost forgotten how heady Eliot is , how much thinking he crowds into " Four Quartets " : The knowledge imposes a pattern , and falsifies , For the pattern is new in every moment I can not imagine what Vivienne Eliot must 've thought when she read those lines . Locked away in Northumberland House , listening to German bombs dropping on London , waiting in vain for her husband to take her home . Hearing his poems in her head . Alone , listening , forced to reconsider everything . What is that sound high in the air London Bridge is falling down falling down falling down Roberta , too , will reconsider . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news about the Hale bequest . But after she mulls it over , the whole thing wo n't seem so astonishing . I think she 'll appreciate my motives even if she ca n't condone them . I picture her in her kitchen , the new poems spread out on her table . By now she 's probably learned them all by heartor the best parts , anyway . I wonder what they 'll prompt . More of her own , I trust ; else why read Eliotor anyone else ? We shall see . ALTHOUGH I VE ALWAYS BEEN CALLED MATT , my first name is n't Matthew but Matthias : after the disciple who replaced Judas Iscariot . By the time I was four , I knew a great deal about my namesake . More than once my mother read to me , from the New Testament , the story of how Matthias had been chosen by lot to take the place of dreadful Judas . Listening , I felt a large and frightened sympathy for my predecessor . No doubt a dark aura hung over Judas 's chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my father 's corner of the sofa . As far as my mother was concerned , the lot of Matthias was the unquestionable outcome of an activity that seemed capricious to me : a stone-toss by the disciples . I tried with difficulty to picture a dozen men dressed in dust-colored robes and sandals , playing a child 's game . One of the Twelve had to carry on , my mother explained , after Judas had perpetrated his evil . The seat could n't be left empty . Hence Matthias : the Lord 's servants had pitched their stones , and his had traveled the farthest . So much for names . To the first-year students at the university where I work , I am merely Mr. Lane , the grey-mustached warden of the obscure Mason Room . But to graduate students I am something like a god , indispensable and unavoidable , keeper of countless objects of desire . And in reality ? in reality I 'm the archivist at one of America 's most prestigious institutions of higher learning , where I oversee a collection of rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers and other prominenti , and boxes of miscellany donated by eccentric graduates . This archive , housed in a quiet wing of the main library , is among the finest anywhere ; and I am its guardian . I assumed my post in 1965 , the year T. S. Eliot and my wife Judith died , and since then I 've inhabited a secure realm . Of course , there have been the predictable encroachments of microfiche , computers , fax machines ... I make use of these things , in fact I find them entertaining ; but they have nothing to do with the life of the mind . The genuine scholars , those for whom books are nearly everything , pay little attention to the junior librarians with their keyboard fixations . The real scholars come to me . In this part of the library , I alone know where everything is . I have memorized the stacks and shelves and drawers , I could find books in the dark : by their broken spines , their covers ' textures , their heft in my hand . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about an unusual book that I have n't seen before , I experience an almost physical pleasure . It 's as if I 'm a boy again , scavengerhunting . When I 'm on the trail alone , sure of my ability to find what I 'm looking for , I experience my rewards . Naturally there are frustrations , when things are misplaced or my time is wasted . I 'm rough on pseudo-scholars , but I like assisting anyone who 's serious even novices who can barely use the card catalogue . I look for the sign of real intention , that hunger which comes over a person 's face when he really needs to find something in print . Except for a few of the oldest and most fragile manuscripts , I allow the collection to be read and used by anyone who passes my inspection . I do n't hoard the treasure . Materials not open to the public , however , are another story . Now and then some unscrupulous researcher will ask for a " quick look " at items that remain under lock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , though it no longer surprises me . With such researchers I assume a weary , antagonized look as I explain that certain bequests arrive with clear restrictions on accessibility . Violating those limits is a form of grave-robbing . Yes : the images that come to me are those of exhumation , the unearthing of something meant to lie fallow something that will appear waxy and lifeless if brought to light too soon . Of course I do n't put it in just those terms . But the message gets across to anyone who thinks I 'll pick up the shovel and dig for him . I was set on edge , then , when last spring a young woman approached me about some letters of T. S. Eliot . I want , said this woman in a tone neither loud nor soft but direct , to read the Emily Hale letters . Had I not looked straight at her , I 'm sure nothing would 've ensued . But I stared at this woman , and in her eyes , which were large and curiously coloreda moss-grey shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to ignore . There was something else . Her eyes summoned for me that strangely evocative line from Eliot 's poem " Usk " : Where the grey light meets the green air . And Judith , whom I 'd buried two decades earlier . Since my wife 's death I had encountered no one who reminded me of her in any way . Glance asideI heard the poem now as if it were being read to medo not spell old enchantments . Let them sleep . The young woman stood very still , waiting , her face a question . The answer , I said aloud to her , is no . MY WORK IS WHATEVER I WANT IT TO BE , and I report to no one regularly . The head librarian ? the man in charge of the University 's entire collection is a figurehead , well-to-do and poorly read , with whom I have only pe unctory contact . His deputy is Edith Bearden , who supervises several Junior librarians . Once a week , over lunch , Edith and I trade news or solicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten along , and after all these years we know ear other reasonably well . Then I 'm withdrawn , which I suppose I often am , she does n't pull at me . But when she needs my help or wants my company ( for libraries can be lonely ) , she 's not afraid to break into one of my unresponsive moods . Hers is the only lasting friendship I 've known , and I 'm grateful for it . Each month I supply the library 's Board with a brief summary of the activities in my wing . I prepare these reports in my office , which adjoins the Mason Room . Normally I leave the connecting door open so I can see who comes in and out . On busy days the receptionist admits around twenty people ; on quiet days we have only a handful of visitors , and peace reigns . During these calm days I become a literal bookkeeper . First I return calls and answer correspondence from other archivists , and then I catalogue new acquisitions . After that , I check the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it should be . I need those hours of silent physical labor , when I am alone with the collection and can experience it in its entirety . It 's become almost a living thing for me . The bound books and loose-leaf manuscripts and files of letters and photos are a many-voiced convocation I attend as a kind o permanent host . Whenever I can , I read . Familiarity with the collection is my first obligation . When I was a child , I had dozens of books . My father built me a bookcase for my tenth birthday . It ran the length of one of my bedroom walls , and I prized it almost as much as the books I arranged neatly on its three shelves . I employed a very simple cataloguing method alphabetization of titles , which meant that my Bible sat between Babar and Boats Under Bridges , a story about the difficult life of a New York harbor tugboat operator . I remember my mother expressing dismay at this arrangement . As a devout Presbyterian , she felt that the sacred Book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she urged me to keep my Bible next to my bed . It was her desire that I read it nightly and attend church each week with her , duties I fought then and have never undertaken since . My mother was an unhappy woman , and unhealthy too terribly overweight and easily agitated by small things . She entered marriage with few established friendships , and as my father discouraged the formation of new ones , she became something of a recluse . Gradually , as I was growing up , she isolated herself from the people in our neighborhood in Washington Heights who might have helped her . Eunice Carey , who had an antique toy train set I coveted , and Betty Keep , a cheery widow I used to accompany on long rambles through the Cloisters these were women who wished my mother well and who felt sorry for me ; I was , after all , the only child of an irascible accountant and a housewife who quoted the Bible a little too frequently . By the time I was twelve , my mother had ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And as both sets of grandparents were long dead and neither of my parents had siblings , I was effectively cut off from a community of adults . Each Friday night my father satisfied his own needs for company by going to a bar around the corner from his of fice near Herald Square . There he would drink for a few hours with other dlssatisfied husbands , finally wending his way home at around eight o'clock , smelling of smoke and scotch . My mother and I would watch him descend from the heights of his drink-induced good humor to the foul mood that typically enshrouded him . He would bark orders at my mother , who lumbered anxiously from table to kitchen to fetch him extra water or more salt , and in my direction he would level a barrage of questions about my performance at school that week . Fortunately I was a good student . Books were my refuge ; I made friends , but often they interested me less than books And at home , in the face of my mother 's perpetual anxiety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where my books awaited me , reliably patient and tolerant . Now and then my father would engage me in conversation about a story I was reading , or my mother would read aloud a poem by Wordsworth or Blake . Those interludes I remember with intense clarity . Everything else from that time feels like a bruise feels when pressed : painful in a dull , unmemorable way . Judith used to say I became an archivist to spite my parents . I suppose that is partly true . I knew my father wanted me to go into a more lucrative line of work , and my mother was eager for me to become a teacher or ( better yet ) a pastorneither of which I had any intention of doing . But the truth of my choice ran deeper . Having so few emotional resources to spare after wasting them on a soured marriage , my parents could make no hard claims on my future . That it should include higher education was perhaps the only point on which we three were in unspoken agreement . Even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was proud of my academic competence but uneasy about my lack of interest in business , and my mother was concerned about my spiritual life , unsupported as it was by any church . Neurotic and awkward and ailing , she still managed to convince herself of the necessity of a spiritual community , and she went to church each week until she became bedridden . She could never accept my solitariness , though I 'd learned it from her . On the day I entered college , I realized in a bitter flash that I owed my parents nothing . I believed , however , that I owed something to books , which had kept me going throughout my least happy stretches , and this belief eventually outweighed all other considerations . After a half-dozen years of work in bookstores , I enrolled in graduate school and began the study of library science . I saw myself then , and still do , as inheritor of a rich tradition , one that straddles the line between mind and spirit . The great 1ibrarians have all been religious men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books is an act of homage and faith . Even Thomas Jefferson , that most rational and ingenious of librarians , revered what he called the Infinite Power . It 's impossible to be a keeper of books and not feel a gratitude that extends to something beyond the intellects that created them to a greater Mind , beneficent and lively and inconceivably large , which urges reading and writing . Judith used to complain that libraries are full of too many false , banal books and she was right , of course , though it 's never bothered me . A library is meant to be orderly , not pure . In 1939 , when I was twenty-one , my father and I made our first and only trip together . We took the train down to Washington . My mother was quite ill , and my father ( normally no traveler ) wanted to get away from the apartment . He proposed that my college graduation present be a visit to the capital . I had been there on a school trip and had no interest in the sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore the Library of Congress . As I 'd anticipated , my father quickly tired of sight-seeing . By the time we reached Capitol Hill he was bored , and he left to seek out a bar on Pennsylvania Avenue . Alone and happy , I entered the library 's cool foyer . At college I 'd read many descriptions of the vast collection , but I was unprepared for the beauty of the building itself its vaulted ceilings and marble floors , its magnificent circular reading room fitted with mahogany benches , rows of soft reading lamps , and heavy brass-trimmed doors that kept out all noise . I walked around the upper gallery , reading the inscriptions that ring the second-story walls just below the ceiling , and I knew then that eventually I would claim such a place as my home . My mother died that year , my father four years later , in 1943 . A few months after his death , I went back to Washington to see the library again . This time I took color photographs , explored the stacks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of the wall inscriptions on note cards . When I returned to New York , I bought a leather binder and made myself a scrapbook of the photos and cards . Judith knew as no one else did what libraries meant to me . The scrapbook was among the first of my possessions I showed her , not long after we met . My memory holds an indelible image of Judith turning that book 's pages , reading the inscriptions aloud . Literate as she was , she identified most of the authors . Then she read her favorite inscription : The True Shekinah Is Man . It came , she said , from the Kabbalahthe writings of Jewish mystics . I asked her to explain the concept of shekinah . As she spoke about the Trees of Life and Death , I watched her full , mobile mouth , her long-fingered hands and slender arms , the shadows at her collarbones . Her entire body was suddenly an astonishing surprise to me . I can clearly remember how she looked up from the book 's pages , her gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senses a cry before hearing it , that my life was going to be changed . Crossing the room , I circled her shoulders with my arms . Her hands tightened at my back as we held each other for the first time , swaying back and forth , our lips skimming each other 's cheeks and then meeting , lightly at first , my teeth on her tongue gently pulling and being pulled . I had experienced nothing so urgent and terrifying as the sound of my pulse at that instant , blood-driven beat of my heart .
