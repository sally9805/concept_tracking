FIFTY-ONE years ago , toward the end of World War II , the U.S. Navy embarked on what it considered a bold experiment . After traditionally barring Blacks from its commissioned ranks , it admitted for the first time 16 Black men to receive training as officers . The result surpassed all expectations . Not only did 13 of the men prove that they had what it takes to become naval officers , they made the highest scores that have ever been made by officer candidates , setting a record that still stands . Today , as a direct result of the experiment 's spectacular success , 3,267 Black naval officers , including seven admirals , are serving on active duty throughout the world . One of them , Rear . Adm . Mack C. Gaston , is the first Black commander of Great Lakes ( Ill . ) Naval Training Center , the historic facility where it all began . Acutely aware and appreciative of the legacy of excellence the " Golden 13 " left behind , Adm . Gaston runs the Navy 's largest training base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 14,000 recruits , 6,000 military staffers and their 10,000 civilian family members . In addition , he is responsible for all Navy activities throughout a five-state area that includes Illinois , Indiana , Michigan , Ohio and Wisconsin . Seated in his office on the top floor of the Training Center 's venerable main building and looking every inch an admiral , the 54-year-old Navy veteran , who spent two-thirds of his 30-year naval career at sea , points out that Great Lakes is bucking the trend of military downsizing in that it is actually expanding . He explains that in 1993 , a year after he took command of Great Lakes , the decision was made to close the Navy 's other two major recruit training centers , one in Orlando , Fla. , and the other in San Diego , Calif. , and to consolidate their functions with those of Great Lakes . " As a result of the decision to keep Great Lakes open , " he says , I was asked by the chief of Naval Operations to stay for continuity purposes while Great Lakes grows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer than the usual two years . " It is anticipated that over the next five years , Great Lakes will become home not only to the Navy 's single recruit training facility but also to 19 of the Navy 's technical service schools , and that its population will grow to about 48,000 . Meanwhile , what makes Great Lakes different from all other facilities in the Navy 's arsenal , Adm . Gaston plains , is its capacity to turn huge numbers of raw recruits into trained , fleet-ready naval personnel . This is accomplished primarily with the help of unique engineering power plants on the base that a exactly like the engineering plants aboard ships . " In fact , " says the admiral , " when our trainees go to those power plants or " hot plants , " as we call them , they do n't know whether they are on a ship or in a building . The power plants a very unique and do n't exist anywhere else in the United States . " Asked whether in view of the military downsizing trend it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a career in the Navy , the admiral responds without hesitation , " Absolutely ! We a still hiring . We still have to bring in new people for all those technical requirements that we have to operate our ships ; and replace the old people who retire or resign . So it is still a very viable option for someone to come in for training as well as education in the United States Navy . " Adm . Caston brings a formidable resume to his job of making naval warriors out of civilian men and women . Highlights of his educational career , both military and civilian , include a B.S. in commercial electronics from Tuskegee University , a master 's degree in business from Marymount University , completion of Naval Command and Staff College ; studies at the Nation Defense University , Industrial College of the Armed Forces ; and the prestigious " Capstone Program " at the National Defense University Institute of Higher Defense Studies . His sea assignments are similarly impressive . They include the command of three ships , the destroyer USS Cone , the guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Josephus Daniels . During his tours of sea duty , he successfully deployed to the Southern and Western Pacific and Vietnamese waters , as well as the Caribbean and Mediterranean . While climbing the ladder toward flag rank , Adm . Gaston served as director of the Navy Equal Opportunity Division and on the chief of Naval Operation 's personal staff . Upon promotion to rear admiral in 1990 , he became commander of Field Command of the Defense Nuclear Agency before assuming his present duties as commander of Great Lakes . The decision of the former landlubber from Dalton , Ga. , to join the Navy rather than the Army , the Air Force or the Marines after graduating from Tuskegee in 1964 was about as calculated as playing Russian roulette . Determined to become an officer and thus avoid " digging foxholes for the Army for two years " as a private , the admiral says he took officer candidate exams for all the services , with the intention of signing up with whichever branch called him first . " The Navy answered first , " he calls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Navy today . I came in to satisfy my three-year obligated service . Then I went to sea and I loved it and I never left . " At the time Ensign Gaston shipped out to sea on his first ship , the destroyer USS Buck , the Navy was considerably less user-friendly toward Blacks than it is today , a fact he was soon to find out the hard way . He and two White fellow ensigns were each assigned to one of three White officers the deck . Each time before going on watch , Ensign Gaston was given three questions " about anything in the Navy " by his officer of the deck . For every wrong answer he gave , he had to stand an watch . Soon , Ensign Gaston was setting records in standing consecutive watch and doing without sleep . But instead of complaining , he became the most inquisitive ensign on the ship , spending whatever time he had left between standing watch and catching catnaps asking ; questions and cramming his head with anything he could learn about the Navy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed and , consequently , less time spent on watch . One day , when he asked one of the other ensigns how he was doing with the questions , the ensign looked at him uncomprehendingly and asked , " What questions ? " At that point Ensign Gaston realized that not only had he been had but that he had been singled out by officer of the deck . " I could have gone to the commanding officer saying , " I 'm being discriminated against , ' but I did nt , " recalls the admiral . The reason he did n't , he explains , is because of what his late father , a plumber and electrician whom he calls his greatest role model , had taut him . " My father taught me to learn all I could and go as far as I possibly could he recalls . " I knew that I was learning . Even though it was meant in a negative way , I took it in a positive way and I never said a word to anyone . As a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deck in six months while normally it takes about two to two-and-a-half years to qualify . So I took what was meant to be very negative and made it very positive . " Adm . Gaston insists he does not suggest that Blacks in the Navy who find themselves discriminated against should just take it without complaining . " What I would advise is that they do n't go with a chip on their shoulder , " he says . " There are some things that should brought to the attention of commanding officers or the system , but I think the most important thing is to get positives out of things , not negatives . If you look for problems , you are going to find them . So look for positives , not problems . " In addition to his father , who died seven years ago , Adm . Gaston credits his success to his wife Lillian , his childhood sweetheart whom he married a year after joining the Nay and with whom he lives in the historic commander 's residence on the base . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ardor of a teenager in love . " I am sure that I would not be where I am today without her . She is most supportive , continuously supportive . " Mrs. Gaston , a petite , soft-spoken lady and mother of their daughter , Sonja , a graduate student at Old Dominion University , returns the compliment . " He is just a very , very good man , " she says . " I could n't ask for a better husband . " <p>
