With Muffy tucked beneath her arm , Summer leaped up the remaining two stairs and dived through that doorway like a quarterback sneaking a keeper over the goal line .

Muffy squirmed out from beneath her and licked her face . Ungratefully , Summer swatted her away . The basement door crashed shut . Frankenstein pushed the button that locked the knob . The bad guys were locked in the basement ! They were saved , saved , saved ! " Cheap-ass lock , " Frankenstein grunted as the knob began to rattle .

" " Who the hell do you think 's in the basement ? Come on , let 's go ! " Tearing at the duct tape around his wrists with his teeth , Frankenstein bolted toward the nearest door . It led to the garage . A fierce banging rattled the basement door . With a single longing glance at her kitchen phone  --  it had been programmed to dial 911 at the touch of a single button  --  she snatched up Muffy and fled after him . He had to use his foot to shove aside something that blocked the door . A dark , motionless form , sprawled on the white linoleum . Betty Kern , Summer discovered as she raced after him . Dead , withWALKING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body lay the mahogany box that contained the silver her mother had given her for her wedding . Forks , knives , and spoons were scattered across the floor . So much for help from that direction . When Summer appeared at the top of the shallow flight of steps , Frankenstein had already found and pushed the button that opened the automatic door . Dawn 's gray light spread across the garage as he ducked beneath the rising panel . There was a car in the garage  --  and it was not hers . The car was a late-model navy Lincoln Continental . Summer knew Lincoln Continentals . Her mother had one , though hers was bright yellow . The racket from the kitchen  --  muffled thuds and curses  --  told her that the thugs were still locked in the basement . This would take a few minutes  --  did she dare take the time ? The thought of the ancient Chevy being pursued by this sleek baby decided her . She would take the time . All but dropping Muffy , who grunted her indignation as she landed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer ran to the car , released the catch , and raised the hood . It took only seconds to rip out the spark plug wires . A gunshot followed by the sound of splintering wood was her signal that time had run out . Clearly they had decided to shoot their way free . Summer hit the button that operated the garage door and sprinted beneath it as it started to close . Muffy ran at her heels , and Summer scooped her up again . As she gained the street she looked this way and that , but Frankenstein was nowhere in sight . He had probably abandoned her and Muffy to their fate . The nogood son of a .. . Still she ran down the street . Dead center , toward where they had left the running car . Without warning the Chevy careened around the corner and roared toward her . Low and black and bewinged , it gave new meaning to her mental image of something that moved like a bat out of hell . Mindful of Frankenstein 's warning that he could n't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road just as the car 's breaks squealed . The Chevy came to a rocking halt about five feet beyond where she had just stood . Yet another way she might have died on this nightmarish night .  | The passenger door opened . " Jesus , Rosencrans , what took you so long ? " Explanations and recriminations could wait . Clutching Muffy to her bosom , Summer flung herself inside . She did n't even have time to close the door before Frankenstein stomped on the gas . Flung back against the seat , Summer clawed at the vinyl for purchase and prayed she would not be thrown out onto the pavement . Muffy , no fool , crawled under the seat . " Shut the door ! " Frankenstein roared . Summer shot him a killing glare . Clinging to the seat back for all she was worth , she dropped a handful of spark plug wires that she did n't remember hanging on to in the first place and reached for the wildly flapping door . Her perch was precarious at best , and if he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slammed the door shut . For a moment she felt as limp as a cooked noodle . Summer slumped in the seat , her head down , her hands curled in her lap . She noted with a flicker of chagrin that her hands were black with grease . How the mighty are fallen , she mourned on behalf of her once much-praised fingers . They were roaring past her house just as the thugs burst through the front door . The three charged out onto the front lawn and watched wild-eyed as the Chevy tore past . At the sight of them Frankenstein must have put the pedal all the way to the floor , because the Chevy peeled rubber like a good fifties car should . They raced to the end of the street , and took the corner on two wheels . As she was flung against the door she had just closed , Surnmer did n't even bat an eyelash . She congratulated herself on getting positively used to flirting with death . They skidded left out of the gates that marked the entrance to Albermarle Estates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch Frankenstein 's eye . " What the hell 's that ? " he asked , indicating the little pile of twisted black wires . With his vision , they probably looked like snakes . Snakes from hell . To match the car . A bat out of hell carrying snakes from hell . Summer giggled . He glanced at her . Both his eyes were visible again , though neither opened wider than a slit . She only hoped he could see . " Keep your eyes on the road , " she admonished him . Not that it WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 103  | would probably do much good , but at least he had n't crashed them . Yet . " What are they ? " He really did sound perplexed . " Spark plug wires , " Summer explained , settling deeper into her seat . Then , at his astonished glance , she added , " To keep them from following us . The nuns did it to the Nazis in The Sound of Music . Hey , I like movies . " Frankenstein glanced at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to laugh .  | their luck ran out on Route 165 just south of Tellico Plains . Or , rather , their gas did . Summer was driving . It was full daylight by this time , but she was so tired that she could barely focus . Her hands , which she had wiped as well as she could on her pants , were no longer black with grease but merely faintly gray , with black rims around the nails . She could n't look at them without feeling queasy . Beside her , Frankenstein frowned down at a map he had found in the glove compartment . For the last fifteen minutes he 'd been trying to use it to plot the escape route that afforded them the best possible chance of avoiding detection . Something , either his blurred vision or the same exhaustion that plagued Summer , was making it an uphill task . " We want to keep heading south on 165 . We should run into a gravel road running east west in about half an hour . I ca n't find it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know it 's there . " His voice was rough-edged with weariness . Putt . Putt . Sputter . Putt . The Chevy seemed to be having a coughing fit . Summer frowned and pushed on the gas . For an instant the car responded . Then it gave another consumptive snort and started to slow down . " Jesus , we forgot about the gas ! " Frankenstein sounded as horrified as she felt .  | Summer stared down at the gas gauge in stupefaction as the Chevy 's speed slowed to a crawl . How could they have forgotten something so important ? But what could they have done even if they had remembered ? It hit Summer like a baseball bat between the eyes : They did n't have any money . She had forgotten to retrieve the thirty dollars from her house . All that for nothing . " Pull off the road . " They were in the mountains now , and the road  --  all the roads ? were uphill . Steep , forested slopes slanted skyward on Summer 's left ; on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . Up ahead , more mountains rose out of the early morning mist . Snow caps blended with drifting white clouds in the distance . A hawk dipped and swooped overhead as Summer pulled off onto the rocky shoulder . They were about halfway up a tortuous two-lane mountain road with no sign of civilization in any direction . They had n't spotted another vehicle since they 'd passed a coal truck skirting Tellico Plains . " Now what ? " Summer asked , shifting into park  --  she 'd really gotten very good at shifting  --  and setting the emergency brake before the Chevy could roll downhill . Frankenstein shrugged and opened his door . She had pulled to the left , across the northbound lane , so the car would hug the mountain rather than perch precariously on the edge of the cliff . Summer got out too , absently tugging on her broken bra strap to get her pertinent assets back where they belonged . Muffy crawled out after her , slunk to the edge of the road , and threw up in the tall grass . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we walk . " Frankenstein already had the back door open . Besides textbooks , and the baseball cap , the backseat yielded four cans of unopened beer remaining in a plastic ring-pack , a zip-up hooded sweatshirt , and a pair of high-topped basketball shoes . From the looks of them , they were at least size eleven . " Must be a big kid . " Frankenstein gave the shoes a cursory glance and set them alongside the beer , cap , and sweatshirt at his feet . " Walk ! " His previous remark just registered on Summer 's consciousness . She was so tired , she could barely stand , much less contemplate putting one foot in front of the other . " You 've got to be kidding ! " " Nope . Unless you can fly . " Frankenstein turned and headed back 106 KAREN ROBARDS  | the way they had come . Too weary to do anything except lean against the car and watch him retreat , Summer was relieved when at last he bent , picked up something from the roadside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had feared she and Muffy were being abandoned . She was almost too tired to care . " What 's that for ? " she asked when he was once again within hearing range . He was carrying a rusty metal rod about three feet long . " To break into the trunk . To see if there 's something in there we can use . He inserted one end of the rod in the crack by the lock . After a few mighty heaves  --  Summer was impressed with the way his biceps bulged beneath the short sleeves of the T-shirt when he bore down ? the metal on both sides of the lock was bowed and bulging . But the trunk was still locked . Summer began to grin . Except for the new cut in his cheek , Frankenstein 's face did n't look quite so fearsome this morning , or maybe she had grown used to the way he looked . Both his eyes were ringed with truly magnificent shiners , but they were open wide enough so that she could actually discern the color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran the color gamut from purple to yellow to green . So when what little normal-hued facial skin he still possessed flushed bright red with annoyance and exertion , she merely admired this cheerful addition to an already impressive array of colors . " What are you laughing at ? " he snarled when his dozenth effort to pop the lock failed . Summer told him , and added helpfully , " Looks to me like what you need is a can opener . " Frankenstein shot her a killing glare . Summer grinned at him . He gave a downward heave on the rod  --  and it bent almost double . But the trunk was still locked . Summer giggled . Frankenstein swore . Withdrawing the rod from the crack , he stared at its twisted shape for a bitter moment before throwing it aside . " Jesus ! " he bellowed , without apparent provocation . Summer jumped in reaction to the shout , then followed the trajectory of his outraged gaze . Muffy trotted daintily away from his foot . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 107  | " Goddamned dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down hard on the trunk . The trunk popped open . Summer could n't help it . She laughed so hard she had to sit down on the ground . She laughed so hard that when Muffy crawled into her lap all she could do was bury her face in the dog 's talcum-scented fur to try to muffle her cackles . She laughed so hard that her sides ached , and she thought she might die from being unable to catch her breath . Then she caught a glimpse of Frankenstein 's sour expression , and laughed some more . " She does that , " she gasped semiapologetically when she could spare enough air for speech . " She does that ? The dog goes around peeing on people 's feet and all you can say is , she does that ? Jesus . " " She does n't much like men  --  and anyway , she saved your rear back at my house . And she got the trunk open . " " I got the trunk open . " " You would n't have gotten it open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might let her live , then . " Frankenstein finished wiping his foot on the grass at the edge of the road and headed back for the trunk . He disappeared from view as he rummaged inside . From the safety of Summer 's lap Muffy barked once , a delicate little yap . " What 's she barking at ? " Frankenstein 's head emerged from the trunk . " I think she 's saying she 's hungry . " " She 's saying she 's hungry ? Give me a break . You 're not one of those dotty women who treat their dog like a kid , are you ? " " She 's not my dog . She 's my mother 's . And she 's not dotty . My mother , I mean . Not Muffy . " Fatigue was tangling her tongue . " She 's not much like you , then . Your mother , I mean . " Frankenstein seemed to get the drift of her speech remarkably well . His eyes appeared briefly over the top of the trunk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " He sounded faintly alarmed . " No , I do n't . She moved to Santee , South Carolina , with my dad when he retired . He died five years ago . She still lives in Santee , but she travels most of the time . " " So what are you doing with the mutt ? " " Baby-sitting . " Summer made a face . " My sister Sandra  --  Mom 's visiting Sandra  --  says her oldest boy is allergic to dog hair . Personally , I think she 's lying . Muffy does n't like Will , her husband . " 108 KAREN ROBARDS  | " I just bet Will does n't think much of Muffy , either . " " Probably not . " Frankenstein slammed down the trunk , only to have it bounce up again , narrowly missing hitting him in the nose . He jumped back and shot Summer a look that dared her to grin . She grinned anyway . " Get off your lazy butt and get over here and help me with this . " He sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what ? " " We 're going to push the car over the cliff . Any questions ? " About a million , but Summer only managed to sputter , " W-why ? " " Because I think it 'll be fun . Why do you think ? They saw it , that 's why . They can identify it . They find it , they find us . We would have had to get rid of it pretty soon anyway . There 's probably a BOLO out on it by now . " " A BOLO ? " " Be on the lookout for . I told you , those guys back there are cops . At least , one of them is : the one with the mustache . He works for Cannon County . I used to see him around . Name 's Carmichael . He knows me , too . " Summer shivered . She was suddenly no longer amused . " Are you sure ? " " Sure as a date with a hooker . Now , want to help me push this car ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up anyway . Frankenstein opened the driver 's door and put one hand on the steering wheel . Summer walked behind the car and braced herself against the back bumper . She did n't enjoy pushing , but she had done it before . The ' 66 Mustang she had driven all through high school had had a carburetor problem . The engine had died almost every time she stopped at a traffic light . Until she saved up enough to get it fixed , she had done a lot of pushing . " Yo , Rosencrans ! " Summer peered around the side of the car . It was impossible to see over it because of the defiantly upright trunk lid . " We 're on a hill . I 'm getting ready to put the transmission into neutral . That tell you anything ? " Summer pondered . " Get out from behind the car , doofus . Push from the front . That way , when it starts rolling backward , you wo n't get run over . " WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 109  | Good point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doofus , " Summer moved to the front of the car . " Ready ? " Summer nodded . " I asked if you were ready ? " It was a bellow . " Yes ! " Summer bellowed back , after checking that Muffy was safely ensconced in the grass . Muffy was sprawled on her belly , her head on her paws , watching alertly . From the look of her , nothing short of a dish of Kal Kan was going to get her to move . Smart dog , Summer thought as her own stomach rumbled . " When I say let go , let go ! Got that ? " Summer nodded again . Then , remembering that he could n't see her , she yelled , " Yes ! " Frankenstein muttered something that sounded vaguely uncomplimentary under his breath . Then the car started to roll backward . Very little pushing was required . The Chevy started slowly , but as Frankenstein maneuvered it across the road it picked up speed . At the end it was really rolling , so fast that Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Frankenstein yelled . Summer already had . He leaped away from the car and Summer watched , fascinated , as it sailed over the edge . For one glorious moment , it hung suspended against the backdrop of mountains and sky and trees , looking for all the world like a hideously overweight bat . Then its back end pitched downward , and it dropped from sight . Seconds later the crash came , or rather a series of crashes . Then silence . No explosion . Nothing spectacular at all . The Chevy did n't even catch fire . Of course , they 'd been out of gas . " Ca n't see it from the road . " Satisfaction was plain in Franken-stein 's voice as he glanced around at her . He still stood on the rocky shoulder , looking down . His eyes flickered over her once , then moved beyond her up the road . " There 's a car coming , Rosencrans . Get out of the way . " Summer glanced over her shoulder . A white Honda had just come around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She walked to the side of the road to stand beside Muffy and the jumble of items Frankenstein had removed from the Chevy . Her heart began to pound . The Honda was getting closer  --  surely it could n't be the goons again . She was getting mighty sick of the goons. 110 KAREN ROBARDS  | Suddenly Frankenstein was beside her . " Do you think they . . . " she began , glancing anxiously up at him . " Shut up , " he said , and slid one arm around her shoulders and the other around her waist . Twisting her so that his back was to the road and her head was on his shoulder , he covered her mouth with his .  | The earth did n't move . Bells did n't ring . Stars did n't explode inside Summer 's head . Wrapped tightly in Franken-stein 's arms , tilted backward , she clung to a pair of very broad shoulders to keep from falling on her butt , suffered the feel of hard , warm lips mashed against hers , and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue . It was clear that Frankenstein 's mind , like her own , was n't on what he was doing . Finally he lifted his head , glanced cautiously up and down the mountain , and set her back on her feet . " All clear . " He sounded as unruffled as if he 'd been kissing a department store mannequin . To Summer 's amazement , his unconcern pricked her vanity . " Good . " If her voice was cool , well , it was better than being hot . And hot was what she was starting to feel . Hot with disgruntlement . Not that she meant to let him know it . After all , she had n't been floored by his kiss either . And if he had tried to use his tongue , she would have bitten it ! " It was just tourists . A family . The backseat was chock-full of toys and kids . " He grinned at her suddenly . " When they saw us lovebirds ,  | the mom and dad averted their heads . I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That kiss would n't have shocked Shirley Temple . Summer was still ruminating on it  --  had she lost her looks to that extent ? was he gay ? ? as he bent over the pile of items by the road . No , he could n't be gay . The scandal with his friend 's wife precluded that . It must be her . Something about her just did n't turn him on . Summer could n't have felt more affronted if he 'd called her a foul name . In fact , she would have preferred it . " Hey , at least we eat . " Frankenstein held up an unopened eightpack box of peanut butter snack crackers for her inspection . Summer eyed them sourly . Muffy responded with more enthusiasm . At the sight of the box , she came to her feet and yapped . " Later , " Frankenstein told her , and dropped the box back on the pile . Besides the crackers , the trunk had yielded a gym bag containing an orange muscle shirt , black nylon shorts , white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous sneakers , and a basketball . There was also a tattered quilt , a tire iron , and a roll of breath mints . Combined with the map , and the items from the backseat , it was quite a haul . Summer reflected that her dentist friend was n't real hot for her either . She 'd had an IUD inserted on his behalf , and hardly needed it . Face it , she told herself , you are thirty-six years old . Over the hill . Long in the tooth . Not a sex kitten anymore . That she did n't want to have sex with Frankenstein , would n't have sex with him if he begged her , if he offered her a million dollars like Robert Redford had to Demi Moore in that stupid movie Indecent Proposal , was beside the point . For her pride 's sake , she wanted him to want her . She was not required to want him back . And if that did n't make any sense , that was just too bad . The scowl on her face would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was busy bundling everything except the basketball , cap , and tire iron back into the bag . He bounced the basketball on the pavement once or twice , his expression wistful . Finally he heaved it over the cliff , watching its downward trajectory with what looked like real sorrow . Then , without so much as a word to her , he clapped the cap  --  it was black , with Bulls written in red across the front  --  on his head , picked up the bag and tire iron , and headed into the forest .  | " You coming or not ? " he paused at the edge of the trees to demand over his shoulder when Summer just stood there glaring at his back . " I 'm missing a shoe , " she told him , only then remembering that pertinent fact herself . Apparently the monster did n't hear . He was moving away , already just one more shadow among the dark trunks . A rumbling warned Summer that another vehicle was headed in her direction . Snatching up Muffy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The forest floor was as prickly and mushy and unpleasant under her bare foot as she had thought it would be . For a moment or so , as she followed him deeper and deeper into the trees , she could barely see . Finally her eyes adjusted to the gloom . She found herself in a primeval forest . It was beautiful , lushly green , with vines snaking up from the ground to twine around gnarled branches and sunlight slanting down in shimmery columns through openings in the leafy canopy overhead . It was also eerie . There was a kind of hush in the air , a sense of time having stopped . Summer had the feeling that she had stepped through the looking glass into another world . A world where she  --  and Frankenstein and Muffy  --  were very much the intruders . A world not meant for humans , but for creatures like the bushy-tailed squirrel who watched her warily from an overhead branch , or the lizard who scrambled across a rock as she passed it . A place where the golden empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that could see , and the droning music made by their former occupants grew louder with each step she took deeper into their domain . She had never been a nature enthusiast . The forest gave her the jitters . " Would you wait ? " she exploded at Frankenstein 's disappearing back , and practically ran to catch up with him . It was amazing how fast he could move even with his limping gait . " Jesus , you 're slow . " He glanced down at her in disapproval as she came panting up beside him . Summer was too winded to do more than grit her teeth . Muffy , for all her deceptively small size , weighed a ton . And the trek , so far , had been all uphill . She set the dog on the ground and plowed on beside Frankenstein . Muffy followed reluctantly . " What now ? " she asked . " What do you mean , what now ? Now we walk . " 114 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Where to ? Do you have a plan ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the earth ? " " Jesus , you talk a lot . " He stepped up the pace . " Just tell me one thing : Why should I stick with you ? I 'd probably be safer on my own . " She stopped walking and stood , arms akimbo , glaring after him . Frankenstein stopped too , turning to face her with a shrug . " It 's your call , Rosencrans . You might be safer on your own . If you think you can find your way back to civilization without me , and if you think they wo n't catch up with you as soon as you do and try to pry my whereabouts out of you . I do n't want to rain on your parade , but if I were you I 'd think back on what the bad guys did to those two other women just because they happened to be in your house . Just because they thought that one of them was you . " Summer shivered . She had been doing her best not to remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she recalled Linda 's limp , bloody body , the question that popped into her mind was : Had it hurt much , to die like that ? Of course it had hurt . Summer shied away from the thought . It was too horrible . Her protective barriers went up once more . She would not think about it . If she did , she feared she would curl up into a whimpering little ball right there and then , and refuse to budge ever again . " You think I 'm taking you with me just for the pleasure of your company , Rosencrans ? " Frankenstein 's voice was hard . " If you do , think again . Now that we 're on foot , I 'll get where I 'm going a heck of a lot faster if I leave you and that mutt of yours behind . I 'm letting you tag along because I owe you . You would n't have gotten involved in this mess if it were n't for me . So I kind of feel responsible for you now . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He turned and lurched off through the trees . As his words percolated through her brain , Summer stared after him for a moment . Then , galvanized by the memory of the two women who had died in her place , she trotted after him . " Could you at least tell me where we 're going , please ? " she panted meekly when she caught up . He did n't seem at all surprised to see her . He did n't seem particularly pleased , either . " My dad and I had a fishing camp up in these mountains , okay ? That 's where we were headed before we ran out of gas , which was n't WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 115  | such a bad thing , now that I think about it . We 're probably safer on foot .

I figure we can hide out for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's got to be a way out . I 'm just too tired to see it . " " Maybe we should . . . " But Summer found herself talking to his back as he set off again . Clearly he was not interested in her suggestion , which involved calling her sister who was a lawyer in Knoxville . But then , she decided as she trailed after him , she did n't really want to get her sister involved in this , anyway . People who got involved in this seemed to wind up dead . A fishing camp , she thought . He was taking her to a fishing camp . At least he had a destination in mind . Taking a deep breath , she decided to follow where he led . What else was she going to do ? Some time later , his attention apparently drawn by her minuteslong silence , he glanced around at her . His pace slowed as he watched her hobbling to catch up . " What 're you limping about ? " he asked . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but at least allowed her to close the gap . " How 'd you lose the other one ? " The thought of bopping him over the head with the nearest solid object occurred to Summer , but that would be even more exhausting than explaining . Clearly he had not noticed that she had been only half shod throughout their entire acquaintance . " Do n't ask . " She was n't up to explaining either . A plaintive whimper from behind them made Summer glance over her shoulder . Muffy , who 'd been trailing farther and farther behind , now sprawled flat on her belly in the leaves . " Come on , Muffy , " Summer coaxed . Muffy wagged her tail . " Here , Muffy . " Summer stopped walking and snapped her fingers . Muffy did n't budge . " Jesus H. Christ , " Frankenstein groaned . " I have to be out of my mind , saddling myself with Chatty Kathy and her fleabag . Why the hell could n't you have left the damned mutt back at your house ? They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave Muffy , " Summer said , shocked . 116 KAREN ROBARDS 116 " Then either get her to walk or carry her . " Frankenstein moved off again . " Come on , Muffy . Here , Muffy . Please , Muffy . " But Summer 's cajoling was in vain . It was obvious Muffy had no plans to move again . Summer went back to fetch her . They walked until Summer 's legs ached . The last straw came when she stubbed her bare toes on a large rock that , thanks to the carpet of fallen leaves , she had n't seen protruding from the trail . " That 's it , " Summer said through her teeth , and dropped to the ground , not caring any longer if Frankenstein left her or not . Stretching her legs out , she massaged her injured toes while Muffy panted in the leaves beside her . When the pain lessened , she leaned back against a tree and stared up into its ruffled branches , trying clear her mind of everything except pleasant thoughts . Frankenstein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her concentrated effort to chill out . " What 's with you ? " Summer glared up at him . " I stubbed my toe . I have not had any sleep for twenty-four hours . I 'm hungry . I 'm scared out of my wits . I have badly chafed wrists , a bumped head , a bruised jaw , an aching rib cage , a broken bra strap , and a lost shoe . To top it off , I 'm stuck here in a primeval wilderness with a murderer who looks like something out of a monster movie while even worse murderers hunt for me so that they can kill me . That 's what 's with me . " " Is your toe all better ? " Summer nodded . " Then do you think we could get going again ? " " I 'm not taking another frigging step .

He was not supposed to abandon her in the wilderness with nothing but a hairball for protection and vicious killers on her trail . " Damn you , Steve Calhoun , " she said to his retreating back as she struggled to her feet . By the time she scooped up Muffy and headed after him , he was almost out of sight . He disappeared , finally , under an outcropping of rock . It jutted WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 117  | about six feet straight out from the mountainside and was about eight feet off the ground . Vines and bushes grew densely in front of it so that inside it was almost like a cave , Summer discovered as she followed him beneath the overhang . He was sitting on the ground , cap resting beside him as he rummaged through the gym bag , when she dropped Muffy and wilted at his side . " We can rest here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm about out on my feet . " He barely glanced at her as he wrestled the quilt from the bag . Summer , so out of sorts and out of breath that she could n't even talk , eyed him evilly . He was out on his feet ? What about her ? " Want to sleep or eat first ? " " Sleep ? We get to sleep ? " This prospect so pleased her that she temporarily forgot a lot of her animosity toward him . " Where ? " A grin crooked his mouth . " Right here , Rosencrans . What were you expecting , a Holiday Inn ? " " Here ? " Summer glanced around . " Out in the open ? There might be bears , or wolves , or . . . anything . " " After murderers , bears and wolves sound pretty tame to me . Besides , I do n't think they have wolves in the Smokies . " Summer noticed he did n't say anything about bears . She was about to point this out when Muffy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , " Summer reminded him . " I guess that means we eat first . " " If you think I 'm sharing what little food we have with a dog , you 've got another think coming . " " She saved your life , " Summer pointed out . " Thank you , " Frankenstein said to Muffy . " Now go out and catch yourself a nice , juicy squirrel . " " She 's not that kind of dog . She 's a Grand Champion , for heaven 's sake . A show dog . My mother treats her like a child . I do n't think she 's ever been outside before without a leash . " " Tough , " Frankenstein said , and tossed Summer a pack of crackers . " We 've got exactly eight packs of crackers , four beers , and a roll of breath mints between us and starvation . Then we 'll be catching squir-rels . " There were six crackers to a cellophane-wrapped package . With Muffy 's pleading eyes on her , Summer ripped her package @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a callous , coldhearted way . They needed to save every single scrap of food for themselves . 118 KAREN ROBARDS  | She passed Muffy a cracker anyway . Frankenstein , munching his own cracker , watched with blatant dis-approval . " Women , " he muttered , shaking his head . " We saved your ass , " Summer responded , including Muffy in that we . " More than once , I might add . " To underline the point she passed Muffy another cracker . " Want a beer ? " Apparently having decided to let the matter of Muffy and the crackers rest for the moment , he tore a Stroh 's from the ring-pack and held it out to her . " I hate beer . " Summer accepted it with a grimace . " I quit drinking beer a while back myself , but unless you see a handy spring it 's all we 've got . " Summer grimaced and popped the top . She was really thirsty , or she would n't have done it . Even the smell of beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the can to her mouth and drank . On top of the buttery , peanuty taste of the crackers , the warm beer was wet . That was the best she could say for it . " I do n't see how people drink this stuff , " she said , wrinkling her nose and passing the can to him . " Here , you may as well have the rest . I only took a sip . " " Yeah , well , I guess enjoying a beer just takes practice . What are you , some kind of goody-two-shoes teetotaler ? " He accepted the can and looked at it for a moment , hefting it in his hand , his expression unreadable . " As a matter of fact , I am , " Summer said , offended by his sneering indictment of sensible people who chose not to indulge in alcohol . " What are you , an alcoholic ? " " Yep , " he said , and held the can out to her without tasting its contents . " You want any more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sure ? " he asked . Summer nodded . He shrugged and stood up to pour the rest of the beer out in the grass by the cave entrance . She was still staring at him as he dropped down beside her again , then crumpled the can in his hand and stuffed it back in the gym bag . " You can stop looking at me like that , " he said with a touch of grim humor as he met her gaze . " I did n't drink it , did I ? And I 'm thirsty as hell , too . " Discomfited , Summer lowered her eyes and busied herself breaking her last cracker into tiny pieces to feed to Muffy , who licked her WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 119  | fingers appreciatively at the treat . When she looked up again , Frankenstein was spreading the quilt out on the rocky ground . It was the kind of quilt that one might keep in the back of the car for picnics , machine-made in a double wedding ring design . The background was cream , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mauve and slate-blue cotton . The quilt was tattered around the edges , with a hole in one corner , and so faded that at first glance it was hard to distinguish the mauve from the blue . As Summer watched , Frankenstein lay down and rolled himself up in the quilt like a hot dog in pastry . Only his head , which nestled on the gym bag , was visible . His eyes closed . To all outward appearances , he was well on the way to falling asleep . " Hey , what about me ? " Summer demanded , outraged . His eyes opened . He frowned at her for a long moment , then silently spread his arms , looking rather like a bird about to take flight as he opened the quilt for her . His message was unmistakable : Here 's the bed ; if you want to use it , you 're going to have to share it with me . Quickly Summer reviewed the alternatives . They were few , and unattractive . At the moment what she needed more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes felt grainy . If she had been a flower , she would have drooped long since . Scowling , she slipped off her remaining shoe , tugged reflexively on her bra strap , and crawled into his arms . They closed around her , pulling her close . Within seconds her back nestled against his chest , her head was pillowed on the gym bag next to his and she was cocooned in his warmth and the quilt . Under the circumstances , to feel as safe as she suddenly did was absurd . She knew it , but she felt safe anyway . His steady breathing stirred her hair . From the sound of it , he was asleep almost the moment she lay still . As she drifted off in turn , Summer smiled a little . She suddenly had an irresistible mental picture of herself trying to explain to her mother just exactly how it was that she had wound up sleeping with Frankenstein .  | teve slept deeply and dreamlessly . When he opened his eyes at last , it was to find himself looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six feet above him , stretched out horizontally , lying on her back on the ceiling in fact . His eyes traveled over her with disbelief . She was wearing cowboy boots , skintight , faded-out blue jeans , and a leather motorcycle jacket . Her frizzy blond hair spilled over her shoulders and around her face , which sported a beaming smile framed in lots of red lipstick and a pair of bright blue , heavily mascaraed eyes . Definitely Deedee . But Deedee was dead . As he remembered that , a cold thrill of horror ran down his spine . She waggled her red-tipped fingers at him . Steve yelped and sat bolt upright . At least , he would have sat bolt upright if he had n't been all entangled in a sleeping woman and a tourniquet-like quilt . " Bad dream ? " murmured the woman  --  Rosencrans  --  groggily , batting thick , mascaraless eyelashes at him as she tried to fight free of sleep . Sleep won . Within a matter of seconds she was once again out like a light . Even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his elbows in a semi-sitting position , the best he could do under the cirWALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 121  | cumstances  --  she still cuddled against his chest , seemingly oblivious to his pounding heart beneath her ear . A bad dream , he echoed her words silently . Yes , of course , that was what he 'd just had . Sneaking a quick , spooked glance at the rocky ceiling , Steve realized that was all it could have been . There was nothing above his head but rock , and moss , and a spiderweb . Deedee was dead , for chrissake . He 'd never had a nightmare like that in his life . A waking nightmare . At least , he thought he 'd been awake . Maybe he had n't . Maybe he had dreamed the whole thing and only awakened when he had bolted upright . Jesus . He had n't been asleep in front of the boat warehouse . Maybe he had a concussion . Maybe , despite his rapidly clearing double vision , his eyes were playing tricks on him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be his punishment for the rest of his life . In the three years since her death , he had never once had a vision of Deedee . If these vividly real images were a kind of punishment , why were they cropping up now ? Who the hell knew ? He needed a drink . It was n't the first time he had felt the fierce craving since he had sworn off alcohol six months ago . What it had done to his mind and his body , to say nothing of his soul , over two and a half years no one would believe . Booze had nearly destroyed him a second time . He 'd fought the fight of his life to get off it and stay off it . There had been a moment there when he 'd been tempted to tell himself that one beer would n't harm him . The grace of God  --  and Rosencrans 's sarcastic inquiry as to whether he was an alcoholic  --  was all that had saved him . He 'd be battling the craving for booze for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a battle that he meant to win . One rejected beer at a time . Settling back down on his less than comfortable bed , rearranging the woman in his arms so that she was n't quite strangling him as she slept with her head on his chest and her arms looped around his neck , Steve tried to dismiss what he had seen . He needed to go back to sleep while he had the chance . It had been a hellish forty-eight hours . His mind needed rest to think ; his body needed rest to heal . When he closed his eyes , he should have been thankful that his 122 KAREN ROBARDS  | worry over what he had or had n't seen on the ceiling was quickly replaced . The problem was what replaced it . Lying there trying not to think of anything at all , he found that his mind was beyond his control . His body , too . With every breath he drew , he grew more keenly aware of the gender of the person sprawled across him . Definitely female . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were burning twin holes in his chest . With the best will in the world not to do so , Steve recalled how they had looked naked : beautiful , rose-tipped white breasts , so satiny smooth they gleamed in the moonlight . Dolly Partonesque breasts . The stuff-of-male-fantasies breasts . Some men liked legs , some men liked asses . He was a breast man , himself . He remembered how it had felt to squeeze one . Booting the memory from his mind , he concentrated on falling asleep . The more he tried not to think about exactly what it was that felt so soft and warm and arousing atop his body , the worse the sensation got . He ended up with the first sober hard-on he 'd had in three years . Steve gritted his teeth and opened his eyes . Since sleep was clearly impossible , the thing to do was think . Work at the puzzle . Try to figure out exactly what was going on , who was behind it , and how he  --  and she  --  could get out of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes later . He could n't keep his mind off sex . It had been a while since he 'd had any , and , physically , the woman in his arms was just the kind he liked : lushly full and feminine . This morning he had discovered that she had the softest lips in the world . Lucky he had had enough self-control not to do anything about it . Under the circumstances , sex with Rosencrans was a complication his life did not need . All at once the back of his neck prickled . He had the distinct sensation that he was being watched . Unable to help himself , he cast a wary glance at the ceiling . No Deedee . Of course no Deedee . He felt both foolish and foolishly relieved . Until he noticed the dog . It was sitting beside their makeshift sleeping bag , its ridiculous beribboned head cocked to one side and its bulging eyes fixed on something behind him . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 123  | Steve turned his head so fast , he damned near cracked his neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished . Deedee vanished . Right before his eyes . Only she did n't actually vanish , of course , because she 'd never really been there in the first place . Shaken , Steve glanced at the dog . She had lost interest in whatever had first attracted her attention and was now placidly scratching an ear . Damned mutt . " Is it time to go ? " Rosencrans was awake again . He looked down into sleepy hazel-brown eyes that blinked dazedly up into his , noted the straight nose , the creamy texture of her skin , and the wide , wellremembered softness of her lips . Now that he was getting his vision back he could see that she was a damned attractive woman  --  no , a damned pretty woman  --  even dazed , dirty , and disheveled . She was leaning heavily against him , her hands linked behind his neck , letting him support her weight . He felt the shapely warmth of her in his arms , against his body , and found his explanation for the sudden unnerving visions of Deedee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because Rosencrans was the first woman he had wanted , stone-cold sober , since Deedee 's death .  | We need to get out of here . " Frankenstein 's words were so urgent that they pierced the fog of grogginess that surrounded Summer . " Why ? " Were the bad guys on their trail ? Coming immediately fully awake , she struggled against the quilt that suddenly felt to her like a straitjacket , desperate to be free . " Because we need to . " Reaching behind his neck , he unclasped her hands and gave them back to her . Humiliated to discover that she had been clinging to him  --  clinging to him , of all things  --  Summer withdrew her hands and her body from all contact with his and busied herself with extracting herself from the quilt . He seemed as anxious to be free as she . " Is someone coming ? " Fear infused her voice and was evident in the quick looks she shot at the mouth of their den . " Did you hear something ? See something ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the gym bag and pulled some things out before stuffing the quilt in . " Then what 's going on ? " Something in his manner was downright scary . He was cold , impersonal , abrupt , unfriendly . That was n't so surprising , but there was something else as well . He almost seemed ? afraid . What had happened while she had been asleep , for goodness ' sake ? WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 125  | " Nothing 's going on . We need to get a move on , is all . Here , put these on . You ca n't go around out here in that janitor outfit . You 'll stand out like a sore thumb . " Frankenstein stood and thrust a handful of garments at her . His eyes as they met hers were hostile . Summer was bewildered . What was wrong ? What had she done ? Taking the things from him , Summer saw that he had passed her the basketball shorts and muscle shirt . " I ca n't wear this , " she said , holding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was all she had given it , it was obvious that the shirt was not made for a woman . Its deep , scooped neckline , narrow straps , and enormous armholes would leave her effectively shirtless from the waist up . " What do you mean , you ca n't wear it ? If the color or something does n't suit you , that 's just too bad . " Summer got the impression that he was deliberately being as nasty as he could be . " It 's not the color , stupid . It 's the way it 's made . See ? " She held the shirt up to herself . The hem reached well past her thighs , the bottom two thirds had ample material  --  but the top , where it counted , was hardly there . Frankenstein 's frown told her that he saw what she meant . " Here , " he said , pulling off his own shirt and handing it over . " Trade me . " Summer accepted his T-shirt , passed him the muscle shirt , and tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a well-muscled , hairy chest , and a compact waist with just the faintest suggestion of love handles puddling over the sides of the too snug cutoffs . His left shoulder and side might be be abloom with purple-to-yellow bruises , but the underlying body was powerfully built . Summer had always been attracted to big , muscular men . He pulled the shirt over his head and jerked it into place . The word Nike leaped into prominence across his abdomen . His shoulders and upper chest remained essentially bare . His eyes met hers . Lest he somehow manage to read her thoughts in her eyes , Summer averted her gaze . " Hurry up , will you ? " he said , picking his cap up from the ground and walking outside , taking the gym bag with him . Muffy padded after him . Left alone , Summer shed her Daisy Fresh uniform and scrambled 126 KAREN ROBARDS  | into the basketball shorts and T-shirt . The shorts were black , made of flimsy nylon , but fortunately were cut to be baggy and fit her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her knees . With a quick glance at the entrance to their hideaway , Summer slipped out of her bra and made a hurried , but secure , knot in the strap . Putting it back on , she was pleased to rediscover how it felt to have secure support on both sides . " You done yet ? " Frankenstein , speaking from just outside the entrance , sounded impatient . Summer dragged the T-shirt over her head . It was a trifle snug over her bosom and hips , but by yanking at the hem she was able to stretch the material enough so that she thought it looked reasonably decent . Now if she could only shower , scrub her teeth , and brush her hair .. . " Almost , " she called , combing a hand through her tangled hair , which straggled around her face and down her back . It was as fine and straight as corn silk , and at the moment felt about as limp . Summer wished vainly for fifteen minutes alone with a showerhead , shampoo , a hair dryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her hair might be plain , ordinary brown , but it could look pretty good when she tried . Would he have kissed her with more enthusiasm if he had ever once seen her with makeup and her hair done ? Summer made the best of things by weaving a single braid that would hang down her back . The only problem was how to secure the end . Since her blouse was ruined anyway , she decided to tear a strip from that and tie it around the braid . Which was harder than she had thought ; she had to gnaw through the material with her teeth first . Frankenstein came in while she was chewing on her blouse . " You ca n't be that hungry yet , " he said . Summer made a face at him , ripped the blouse , and secured her hair . " How do I look ? " she asked , gesturing at her outfit . " Like you 've been camping about a week too long , " he said , and thrust the pair of high-topped black sneakers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't wear those . They 're miles too big . " " Beats going barefoot . " " You wear them , and I 'll wear the flip-flops . " " Look , Rosencrans , we 're going to be hiking for miles . Miles , do you understand ? You ca n't hike in flip-flops . You could turn an ankle , WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 127  | and if you do I 'll be damned if I carry you . Or you could step on a broken beer bottle , or a snake . You could ... " The snake did it . " Give them to me . " He did . Summer saw that the athletic socks were inside . With a grimace she sat and pulled them on . As she did , she saw that he was donning the other pair . White low-tops , sockless . " How come you get the low-tops , and I get the high-tops ? " " Because the shoes fit me . They do n't fit you . I gave you the hightops so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't fall off . " Good point . Good idea . Summer did as he suggested . By the time she finished , he had already gathered up her discarded clothes , stuffed them into the gym bag , picked up the tire iron , and headed outside again . He was gazing into the distance , his mouth unsmiling , his eyes shaded by the brim of the baseball cap , when she joined him . He was clearly out of sorts about something . For her even to be able to tell that much about his expression , she realized , the swelling in his face had to be going down . She wondered again what he would look like when he was back to normal . Would he be handsome ? Cut and bruised and blood-streaked as his face still was , it was impossible to say . She wished he would kiss her again . With enthusiasm , this time , just to see what kissing Frankenstein would be like . " What 're you looking at ? " His gaze swung around , catching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer turned pink , embarrassed by her own wayward thoughts . He scowled . " You need to wash your face , " she managed to say , and was proud of herself for the coolness and quick thinking of her response . " So do you , " he answered , and swung off uphill without another word . Summer had had about enough of his surliness . She was n't catering to it any longer . Head high , she turned and marched in the opposite direction . Muffy , torn , sat on her furry bottom , looked from one separating human to the other , and whined piteously . Summer ignored her , too . When she emerged from the shelter of a nearby bush , business completed , she was secretly relieved to find Frankenstein waiting beside Muffy , arms crossed over his chest , shoulder propped against a tree , cap brim pulled low over his eyes . She had n't thought he would 128 KAREN ROBARDS  | just walk off and leave her , but she had n't been entirely sure . Now she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twelve hours earlier , the mere sight of the monster wearing such a glower would have terrified her . Now , safe in her new certainty that he would n't leave her , she felt at ease enough to glower back . " Ready now ? " he asked with deep sarcasm . " Yes , sir , " she answered with a mock salute , and had the reward of seeing his scowl deepen . " Here . We can eat as we walk . " He tossed a pack of crackers at her , swung around , and headed off again . Or maybe stalked was a better word .  | he sign hammered into a tree where the trail forked said HAW KNOB , ELEV. 5,472 FEET . The arrow pointed straight ahead . When Frankenstein headed east instead , Summer heaved a sigh of relief . Serious mountain climbing at this point would , she feared , just about do her in . " Woof . " Chocolate doggy eyes looked up at Summer pleadingly . Muffy squirmed in her arms . Not bothering to set her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not walk  --  Summer shifted her weight to the other arm , and shot a dagger look at the broad masculine back some dozen feet ahead . The man was tireless . They 'd been walking without a break for what seemed like days . It was twilight now , and she for one was exhausted . Her feet hurt : the too big shoes rubbed blisters on her heels even through the thick socks . Her arms hurt : Muffy , for all her smallness , weighed a ton . Frankenstein 's callous suggestion was that if Summer grew tired of carrying her , she should just pitch her over a cliff ; he did n't offer to carry her . And Summer refused to ask . Her fondest wish was that Muffy would pee on his foot again . But the dog could n't even do that if they did n't stop . An insect bite on the side of Summer 's neck itched , and she 130 KAREN ROBARDS  | scratched it dispiritedly . It was one of about two dozen she had collected . As the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never in her life had she thought to find herself envying a mosquito , but at least they had something to dine on . Summer was so hungry that she ached with it . Her stomach was so empty that it felt like it was collapsing . She pictured it as a deflating balloon . There were three packs of crackers left . Frankenstein had already announced that they would have to be saved for the morrow . Sum-mer 's head understood ; her stomach emphatically did not . " Woof , " Muffy pleaded . " Hush , " Summer said , nuzzling her suddenly tortured nose against Muffy 's fur . She knew what had prompted that forlorn bark . She smelled it too : food . Up ahead , to their left , was a lodge . Frankenstein was carefully skirting it , anxious to avoid as many people as he could . He was right , of course . The less attention they attracted , particularly given his battered state , the better , but still the aroma pulled at her like a magnet : woodsmoke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach growled . Muffy whined . Sympathetically , Summer scratched behind her ear . Muffy shook her hand off . What she wanted was not love , but food . Up ahead , Frankenstein forged on through the trees , looking to neither the left nor the right . Of course , he was beyond feeling anything as human as hunger . He 'd been cranky all afternoon . If Summer had had any better choices , she would have left him high and dry hours ago . Only she did n't have any better choices . She and Muffy were stuck with Frankenstein . A couple strolled hand in hand out of the darkness to her right . They saw Summer moving through the trees nearby and gave a friendly wave . Summer waved back and watched them as they continued toward the lodge . She was traveling perpendicular to the path on which they trod ; up ahead , Frankenstein had already crossed it . A quick glance showed her that he had been all but swallowed up by the darkness ahead . If she was n't careful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious thought , Summer watched enviously as the couple crossed a small , decorative bridge that led to the lodge 's parking lot . Beyond them , a car pulled in , its headlights illuminating several of its already parked fellows , and picking up the bright madras WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 131  | plaid of the woman 's sundress . Her companion wore a pale blue sport coat and tie and held her hand . Clearly they were going in to dinner . Summer ached to be in that woman 's shoes . Not for the sake of the man , or the dress , but for the dinner . Imagining the meal the woman would soon consume threatened to bring tears to her eyes . All at once Summer realized that Frankenstein was completely out of sight . She increased her pace , and tried to keep her mind off food . It was impossible . Her nose was mercilessly tantalized . Her gaze kept slipping sideways . The lodge was lit and so were several cabins to one side of it . Through the uncurtained windows , Summer could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple she 'd been watching reached the stone terrace . Another couple moved toward them , and they shook hands all around . Then they went inside  --  undoubtedly to have dinner . By chasing after Frankenstein , she would be leaving behind what she was rapidly coming to think of as the last outpost of civilization . The tantalizing smell of grilling steaks beckoned her back . Frankenstein did n't care if she starved . She could turn around , right that very minute , and become part of civilization again simply by joining the people at the lodge . Their company would be infinitely preferable to that of a grumpy murderer who had hardly deigned to glance at her for hours . A murderer who was on the run for his life  --  and whose very existence endangered hers . Without him , no one would ever have displayed the least inclination to kill her . Which was the only reason he was letting her tag along with him . The knowledge was galling . But even if she did opt for the lodge , Summer thought , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unkempt as she was , her appearance would attract attention . She could ask for help  --  but what help could , or would , those innocents give her ? They would certainly call the police . Summer shivered . She was n't quite sure whether she believed Frankenstein 's assertion that the police were the bad guys  --  but she was n't quite sure she did n't , either . One thing was certain : She did n't want to find out the hard way . Gritting her teeth against civilization 's devilish allure , Summer kept walking . Muffy whined . Trees whispered in the wind . Frogs croaked and crickets chirped . The cicadas hummed . A car horn honked in the 132 KAREN ROBARDS  | distance . The smoke-borne smell of the steaks grew fainter . So did the hum of voices . Good-bye , civilization ! Summer 's stomach growled a sad farewell . Muffy seemed to droop in her arms . She almost bumped into Frankenstein , who was waiting beneath a tree for her to catch up . " If you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he growled as she blinked at him in surprise , and turned and stalked away again . Scowling at his retreating back , Summer followed wearily . Soon there was no trail . Instead he forged his own path through the undergrowth . In the gloom Summer stumbled over rocks and tree roots she could n't see . The pace he set was killing . As the lodge receded to nothing more than a fond memory , Summer grew increasingly afraid to let Frankenstein out of her sight . It would be just her luck to lose him far from the succoring lodge . " Slow down , " she gasped at his back after a while . He kept walking . " I ca n't keep going at this pace . " He kept walking . " I 'm starving . " He kept walking . " Ca n't we at least take a break ? It 's the middle of the night . " He kept walking . " Asshole , " Summer muttered under her breath , and kept walking too . The wind moaned through the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash and a resounding thud . Summer shot forward like a rabbit flushed by a hound and grabbed Frankenstein 's arm . " What 's the matter with you now ? " He sounded grumpy as ever . " What was that ? " She was too apprehensive to care . " What ? " " That sound . " " A falling branch . What did you think it was ? " His face was in shadow as he glanced down at her . Feeling foolish , Summer dropped his arm . " I do n't know . A bear , maybe . A hungry bear , wanting Muffy and me for dinner . " He grunted derisively , muttered something under his breath that sounded like " I should get so lucky , " and started walking again . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 133  | Summer stared after him , affronted . He was almost out of sight when she hurried to catch up . She vowed that she 'd let herself be eaten by a dozen bears before she spoke to him again . In unfriendly silence they waded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through clearings . Summer tripped on fallen limbs and got snared by brambles , and kept walking . The night smelled of damp leaves , horse manure , and , more faintly , flowers . Delphiniums ? one part of her mind wondered abstractedly . Or maybe lily of the valley ? There was definitely a hint of honeysuckle . Muffy 's weight dragged on her arms , making her back and shoulders ache . Several times she set the dog down and moved off , only to have to return for her when Muffy adamantly refused to budge . " I ought to leave you , " she muttered the third or fourth time this happened . Securely cradled in warm arms once again , Muffy licked Summer 's chin . What time was it ? Summer wondered . Midnight ? One or two a.m. ? Was Frankenstein going to walk all blasted night ? She had to pee . She was afraid if she stopped for long enough to relieve herself , Frankenstein would disappear . She was going to have to break down and call to him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a yap Muffy leaped from her arms and took off through the trees . It was so unexpected that Summer could only gape after her . Up ahead , Frankenstein just kept walking . " Hey ! " she called . Then , more loudly , " Yo , Frankenstein ! " He stopped , looked around . She beckoned wildly , though she was n't sure that , dark as it was , he could see . Apparently he could , or at least he got the gist of her urgent gesture . He retraced his steps . " What now ? " He sounded positively poisonous . " Muffy took off . " " What ? " Summer repeated herself , pointing in the general direction in which Muffy had disappeared . He swore . " We 've got to get her back . Just like the car : they find her , they find us . They could n't possibly not identify her . She 's so ridiculous-looking , she 's got to be one of a kind . " " She is not ridiculous-looking ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of indignation on Muffy 's behalf . 134 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Just help me find the damned dog , okay ? " But Muffy was nowhere in sight . They split up , beating through the trees on a vaguely parallel course , calling softly for Muffy . Their only answer was the sudden hoot and rushing flight of an owl overhead . Apparently they had disturbed its hunting . When it was no longer within sight or sound , Summer got up from the crouch into which she had dropped at the owl 's advent and started walking again . With every other step she glanced cautiously upward and all around . Who knew what other creatures might be lurking nearby ? Summer smelled it first  --  smoke . She slid across to Frankenstein , who had paused . He smelled it , too . Together they advanced through the woods in the direction of the aroma , cautiously . If it had attracted them , perhaps it had attracted Muffy . Through the trees they saw the outline of half a dozen tents , silhouetted by a roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uniforms sat around the campsite . One of the men was talking . Whatever he was saying had the children transfixed . Boy Scouts on a camp-out , probably swapping ghost stories . Summer recognized the uniforms and smiled . They were also roasting hot dogs and marshmallows on sticks over the fire . As Summer realized that , her stomach gave a mighty growl . " Hey , look ! Something 's stealing our things ! " " It 's a coon ! " " It 's a possum ! " " It 's a bear ! " " Grab the crossbow ! " " Crossbow , hell ! Grab the rifle ! " To a man , the Boy Scouts and their leaders leaped to their feet and dashed toward where Summer and Frankenstein watched them through the trees . Just ahead of the pack streaked a small , furry creature that looked for all the world like a diminutive Cousin Itt . A white plastic grocery bag bounced along the ground beside it . The handles were clutched in its mouth .  | Frankenstein snatched up Muffy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With a tribe of whooping Boy Scouts in hot pursuit , they crashed through the forest in great leaping bounds . Foot snagged by a wayward vine , Summer went down . To her surprise , Frankenstein came back for her . Grabbing her hand , he hauled her to her feet and dragged her along after him . Gradually the sounds of pursuit died away . Summer developed a stitch in her side . Pulling her hand from Frankenstein 's , she slowed to a walk , pressing her hand to her side , and finally stopped altogether . " I 'm not taking another step . " She spoke with finality . It was an effort to breathe . " You 're not very athletic , are you ? " he said disapprovingly , turning to frown down at her . " No , I 'm not . If you 'd wanted Jackie Joyner-Kersee , you should have kidnapped her . I 'm sure she would have been delighted . " " You know , you 're a real pain in the butt . " " You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Macho Man , " Summer snapped back , glaring up at him from her bent-over position . To Summer 's surprise , he grinned . It was the first smile she had seen on his face in hours . 136 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Slumped over like that , you look kinda like the Hunchback of Notre Dame . " " Then we make a fine pair of monsters , do n't we , Frankenstein ? " He laughed . Summer eyed him less than fondly . While she carried nothing , he was loaded down with gear . The gym bag was slung over his right shoulder , and the tire iron and grocery bag dangled from his right hand . Muffy was tucked under his left arm like a football . Muffy alone weighed a ton , Summer knew . And the blasted man was n't even breathing hard . " All right , that was a pretty good run . You 've earned a rest . Besides , your dog fetched supper . " " Is it food ? " All thoughts of disliking him forgotten , Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He passed it over . Summer looked . The sack contained three unopened packages : hot dogs , buns , and marshmallows . A yellow plastic cigarette lighter , price sticker still affixed , slid along the seam at the bottom . " It 's a feast , " she said , awed . Frankenstein took the sack back . " Come on , let 's go find a place to cook it . " Summer groaned . " I 'm telling you , I ca n't walk any farther . Not another step . " " Not far . Just till we find somewhere where we can light a fire without burning the forest down . Do n't quit on me now , Rosencrans . Maybe our luck 's turning . " " McAfee , " Summer corrected weakly , but he was already on the move again . Taking a deep breath , relieved to discover that she could , Summer grudgingly followed . Not so much Frankenstein , but the food . After about a quarter of an hour they came to a wide , rippling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so tired that she would have walked right into it if Frankenstein had n't stopped at the edge . Instead she walked into him . Her nose bumped against his broad back . " Over there , " he said , pointing to the other side as , rubbing her nose , she stepped out beside him . " We can build a fire and spend the night . " Thank God . Across the water lay a rocky area strewn with boulders . It stretched for about forty feet to where a tall cliff crowned with pointy-topped WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 137  | pines cut across the skyline . Flinty pale against the night sky , the cliff looked as if it had been hewn from limestone . Crystals imbedded in the rocky sides gleamed dully in the moonlight . Frankenstein waded into the water . Taking a deep breath , pressing her palm against her still bothersome side , Summer followed . In contrast to the seventyish temperature of the air , the water was cold . Icy , as a matter of fact . It swirled about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ahead , Frankenstein splashed toward the opposite shore . Reassured , Summer saw that even in the middle of the stream the water barely passed his knees . She would not drown . She would not even get the hem of her shorts wet . She took the opportunity to stop and scoop up sand from the pebble-strewn bottom to scrub her hands and face . As she rinsed away the sand with more icy water she felt better . Frankenstein had reached the bank while she was attending to her ablutions . He took off his cap , set it , Muffy , and the gear down on the bank , and turned back to lend her a hand . At least , she thought that was why he was turning back , and she splashed forward to meet him . Her dislike of him softened still more , blunted by his concern for her . He stopped some two feet away , bent double , and thrust his head beneath the surface of the water . Summer was so startled by the unexpectedness of his action that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaker slid on a mossy rock , and for a moment she teetered wildly . Then , with a startled cry and an enormous splash , she went down . Her mouth was still open when the water closed over her head . The suddenness of it , the shock of finding herself totally submerged in icy water , caused her to panic . She choked , flailing like a chicken on the chopping block . A hand caught the front of her T-shirt and dragged her upward . Her head broke the surface of the water , and she coughed and gagged and spat as she tried to fill her waterlogged lungs with air . Soaked to the skin , she was hauled to her feet and steadied with a warm hand on each elbow . Glancing up , she saw Frankenstein 's grinning , dripping face . He deliberately held her at arm 's length so that she would not get his clothes wet . " If you laugh , I 'll kill you . I swear I will , " she said through gritted teeth and a curtain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Summer thought about kicking him . With her luck her foot would fly out from under her and she would end up taking another dunking . She thought about punching him , but she figured he 'd dodge . She 'd probably end up in the drink again that way , too . Either way , he 'd laugh even more . She turned and stomped toward shore . Her water-filled shoes felt like they weighed about a hundred pounds each . Squelching up onto the bank , dripping and shivering , Summer wrapped her arms around herself . She must have been quite a sight , because Muffy took one look at the apparition arising from the stream and started backing away . Behind her , she thought she heard a snicker . Over her shoulder , she threw Frankenstein a glare that should have toasted his toes . Was she ever mad ! Mad at him , mad at herself , mad at the world ! If Heaven had planned the whole sorry last twenty-four hours as some kind of cosmic entertainment , well , she would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also freezing her buns off . " Here , " Frankenstein said , sounding faintly choked as he pried one set of her frozen fingers from her arm and thrust the quilt into it . " Go get out of those wet clothes before you catch pneumonia . I 'll start a fire . " Casting him a venomous glance , Summer , clutching the quilt , retired behind a large boulder with what dignity she could muster . When she emerged sometime later , swaddled in the quilt like a papoose , her wrung-out clothes held stiffly before her , her wrung-out hair twisted in a soggy coil down her back , she was relieved to discover that he was paying her not the least attention . His back was to her as he worked to blow life into a flickering flame that licked halfheartedly at a pile of twigs . Muffy was stretched out like a small fur rug at his side . Summer hung her clothes from branches , careful to snag them securely so that they would not fall during the night . She turned her enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time she had finished , Frankenstein had the fire going and was threading hot dogs onto a stick . Food . Nothing less than that would have enticed her to approach the fire  --  and him . She was very conscious of being naked beneath the quilt . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 139  | " Here , " he said as she approached , and handed her another stick that skewered four marshmallows . Regarding him warily , Summer sank cross-legged to the ground . The quilt unexpectedly parted in front , baring an embarrassing expanse of pale inner thigh . Shooting a quick look at Frankenstein  --  thank God he appeared to be staring into the flames , oblivious  --  she hitched the soft cotton closer around her body . Modesty restored , she too focused on the fire and concentrated on roasting her share of dinner to a turn . He ignored her . She ignored him . The wind , still warm from the day , blew softly across the clearing . Flames danced around the small pile of sticks as it passed . Overhead , stars twinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frankenstein was about a yard away , and , like her , he sat crosslegged on the hard-packed earth . Try as she would to pretend he was not there , he loomed large in her peripheral vision . His wet hair glistened seal-black in the firelight . The right side of his face , the side that was nearer her , was not as badly damaged as the left . There was still some bruising , but most of the swelling seemed to have receded . It was possible to discern that he had high , rather flat cheekbones ; a straight , high-bridged nose ; thin lips ; and an obstinate chin . The natural color of his skin was slightly sallow , she thought . As an adolescent he must have suffered with acne , because his cheek bore faint traces of scars . Not a handsome man , she decided smugly . And remembered that disinterested kiss . He glanced at her . Ringed by twin shiners , his eyes were as black as his hair . They were guarded eyes , dangerous eyes . The eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or kill . One glance from those eyes should have made her shiver in her shoes . Which , she discovered to her surprise , it did . Only not from fear . She glanced away hurriedly , so that he would not think she was looking at him . When her gaze stole back to him , he was once again staring into the fire . Summer found herself admiring the breadth of his shoulders , bared by the orange Nike shirt and gleaming in the firelight , and the rippling muscles in his arms . Beneath the tight cutoffs , his thighs and calves were well muscled , too , and well furred as well . The deep neck of his shirt revealed that his wide chest was liberally endowed with swirls of silky black hair . 140 KAREN ROBARDS  | He was n't handsome , but he was masculine . Intensely , powerfully masculine . The sheer force of that masculinity was sexier than mere handsomeness on its own could ever be . As she came to that conclusion , Summer found herself meeting his gaze . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held . Then , as casually as if nothing momentous had occurred , Frankenstein shifted his attention back to the hot dogs he was roasting over the fire . Summer , on the other hand , felt like she had just been struck by lightning . How was it possible to be cold , scared , and starving  --  and yet at the same time wildly attracted to the man who had caused all three ? When he did n't even seem to realize that she was a woman ? By the time the marshmallows were done , Summer felt as grumpy as he had acted all day . She was also so ravenous that she could n't even wait for the marshmallows to cool . Instead she pulled one from the stick while it was still bubbling hot , and popped it into her mouth . And promptly burned her tongue . " Oh ! Ah ! " she gasped , and gulped desperately at the beer Frankenstein obligingly passed her . With her tongue cooked to a crisp and the cloying sweetness of the marshmallow acting as a barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you hated beer , " he observed when at last she lowered the can . " I do . " Her tongue still tingled . She waggled it experimentally . " No beer parties in college ? " He carefully pulled a hot dog from the stick . " No . " Summer shrugged . " No college . " With rapt interest she watched as he balanced the stick by the fire , split a bun and tenderly placed a hot dog therein . " None at all ? " He took a huge bite . " Nope . Hey , how about me ? " Indignantly she reached for the stick he had put down , which still held three hot dogs . He was obliging enough to trade the package of buns for a marshmallow . " How come ? " He ate the marshmallow whole . " How come what ? " Summer took her first bite of hot dog . It tasted wonderful , fantastic , divine . If she 'd been writing for a Mobil Travel Guide , she would have awarded it five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went to New York to model instead . As a teenager I took classes at a modeling school in Murfreesboro  --  they cost an arm and a leg , let WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 141  | me tell you  --  and modeled part time . After high school graduation , the school set up some interviews for me with some agencies in New York . One took me on , and the rest , as they say , is history . I always thought there 'd be plenty of time later for college . I was wrong . " She took another bite out of her hot dog : ambrosia . " So how long did you stay in New York ? " Muffy was approaching him flat on her belly , her tongue lolling , her tail wagging abjectly . She gave a delicate little yap , and Frankenstein scowled at her . Then , to Summer 's surprise , he broke off a third of his hot dog and handed it to her . " I modeled till I was two months shy of twenty-five . Not high fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly , and some hand work . Lingerie was n't as big then as it is now , and hands were n't big at all . I made a decent living , went to a lot of really neat parties , and enjoyed myself in general . Then all at once there were other girls , younger girls , who were in demand . Just as suddenly as that " ? she snapped her fingers ? " it was over . I was too old . So I came home . " Snapping her fingers had been a mistake . Muffy did her crawlingrug imitation in Summer 's direction . Summer fed her part of a marsh-mallow . " How long ago was that ? " " Eleven years . " " So you 're thirty-six . " " Sounds awful , does n't it ? " Summer took another bite of hot dog and tried to pretend she did n't care . She did . Getting older was not something she had been prepared for . No longer being young and reasonably gorgeous had required a lot of adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's feet around her eyes , having to use her mascara wand and then a rinse to color the gray hairs that increasingly appeared among the brown , was not something she had ever expected would happen to her . But of course it had . She was glad getting over it was all behind her , which it was . Except when a man , especially one who interested her as much as Frankenstein was beginning to , seemed to feel that she possessed not one iota of sex appeal . Then getting older stung all over again .  | Thirty-six sounds pretty good to me . I 'm thirty-nine . " " Men are different . Given the chance , I bet you 'd date twenty-year-olds . " Disgust laced Summer 's voice . " Nope . I like my women old enough to know better , but young enough to do it anyway . " Summer snorted . " Ha-ha . " He grinned and pulled another marshmallow from the stick . " So what happened after you came home ? By home you do mean Murfreesboro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in Murfreesboro , and when New York stopped happening I came home to Murfreesboro . Do n't you know that , however far they may wander , Tennesseeans always come home ? " " I think I may have heard that somewhere . " Frankenstein bit into his second hot dog with as much evident enjoyment as he had attacked the first . " You came home to your family ? Parents , brothers , sisters ? " " Mom , Dad , older sister Sandra , younger sister Shelly . I was the one in the middle . The headstrong one who never would listen . Dad used to say I always had to learn things the hard way . He wanted to send me to college ; I took the money and went to New York instead . My sisters , on the other hand , chose college . Sandra 's a medical techWALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 143  | nologist out in California now , happily married for fifteen years , with four gorgeous children . Shelly lives in Knoxville . She 's a lawyer , happily married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's me : a divorced , childless janitor . " Summer laughed , but there was no humor in the sound . Her sisters had sensibly chosen to follow the paths their parents had mapped out for them ; Summer , on the other hand , had defied all advice to reach for a star  --  and in the process gotten her fingers badly burned . " At least you had the courage to try . " This comment , coming from Frankenstein , from whom she would have expected some kind of joke at her expense , startled Summer . After a moment spent twisting the notion this way and that , she looked at him with real gratitude . Never had she thought of her choice in quite that way , and to do so eased a hard little knot of regret that had been festering for a long time inside her . Before she could comment , he continued : " So what did you do , a New York lawn-jer-ee model , back home in Murfreesboro ? " Summer smiled a little . " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor son . Despite the little hitch of his being Jewish , my parents were thrilled . Despite the little hitch of my being Baptist , his parents were thrilled . I was even thrilled  --  for a while . It wore off . " " What happened ? " He sounded surprisingly sympathetic . Summer bit into her hot dog . " He married the lingerie model , not me . When he found out that my natural weight was some twenty pounds heavier than it was when he married me and my hair did n't curl unless I put curlers in it and my lips were n't naturally red without lipstick , he freaked . " " Oh , yeah ? " Frankenstein responded to Muffy 's rug routine by tossing her a section of bun . " So you got a divorce , huh ? " " Not right away . I wish I had . He spent five long years trying to turn me back into the woman he thought he had married . Someone who was feminine , sexy , and glamorous twenty-four hours a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool me . " Without meaning to , the bitterness Summer had thought was long behind her crept into her voice . The things she had done for Lem ! She had dressed to the teeth , kept a perfect house , cooked meals from scratch , entertained his friends and colleagues with the slavish attention to detail of a frigging Martha Stewart  --  and spent a lot of time watching movies on the VCR while Lem worked all the hours God sent . She had been slowly going 144 KAREN ROBARDS  | crazy with unhappiness , and all the while , to please him , she had dieted to the point of starvation . Sometimes , when she could n't stand it any longer , she would wait until Lem was out of the house and stuff herself with anything she could find  --  ice cream , bread , candy bars she had hidden just for that purpose . Then she had inevitably been sick . Sick to her stomach , yes , but also sick with shame for not being able to be the girl Lem thought he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  practically every time he 'd seen her eat a normal meal , in fact  --  he had n't realized he was marrying a hog . With Lem , she had always felt like a hog . Frankenstein looked her over thoughtfully . " More fool he , I 'd say . For an old bag of thirty-six , you 're not half bad . " Summer gave him a sudden , dazzling smile . " I do n't know what you 're after , Frankenstein , but keep on buttering me up like that and you just might get it . " He grinned . " It was a compliment . I swear . " " That 's what they all say . " " Have a marshmallow . Maybe it 'll sweeten you up . " " Maybe . " They split the last toasted marshmallow . Summer savored the sticky confection as it melted on her tongue , then mourned its passing . Frankenstein must have felt the same way , because he licked the gooey residue from his fingers when his half was gone . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Lem . Dr. Lemuel C. Rosencrans , urologist . Are you really interested in hearing the rest of my life story ? " " There 's no TV . Got nothing better to do . " Summer made a face at him . " Okay , I got a divorce . With no-fault divorce , and without any children , and since Lem was already a doctor when I married him , and since we had no equity to speak of in our house , I ended up with practically no money . Which was a shock . I 'd never known before what it was like to have to worry about what I was going to eat the next day . My parents were living in Santee by that time and my dad was ill . They were sick about the divorce . I did n't want to burden them any more than they were already burdened . My sisters were married and moved away . It was me , on my own . I was determined that I was going to make it , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any education , or training for any type of job . I 'd been a lingerie model  --  try finding a job with that kind of reference in WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 145  | Murfreesboro  --  and a housewife . I 'd gotten too old and fat to model underwear and I no longer had a husband or a house . But one thing I did bring out of my marriage : By golly , I knew how to clean . So I started cleaning other people 's houses . And Daisy Fresh was born . It 's supported me ever since , and it 's grown every year . " Frankenstein swallowed the last bite of his hot dog . " I do n't know how to tell you this , Rosencrans , but that 's quite a success story . " His comment pleased Summer inordinately . " Thank you . " " So by now you 've got what's-his-name out of your system , I presume . What about new boyfriends ? " " I 'm seeing someone . Jim Britt , a dentist . " " Serious ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No . " " Good . " She looked at him carefully . " What do you mean , good ? " " I 'd hate to think of you turning back into some doctor 's little housewife . " His expression was bland . " That will never happen again in this life , believe me . I 've learned my lesson . " Summer shuddered theatrically , watching with regret as he folded the top of the marshmallow bag to guard against temptation . About a dozen marshmallows still remained inside . Prudence dictated that they , and the remaining hot dogs , buns , crackers , and breath mints , be saved for the future meals . " If we 're playing Twenty Questions , I have a few for you : Did you go to college ? " " Yup . Eastern Kentucky University . Majored in law enforcement . But not right out of high school . First I joined the Marines . " " On purpose ? " Most of the fortyish men she knew had spent their formative years doing their best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . " " Why ? " ? " Let 's just say I was a sucker for that the few , the proud crap . " " Really ? " " And I did n't want to get drafted . I thought I 'd come out better if I joined before they nabbed me . " " Did you ? Come out better , I mean . " " I 'm still in one piece , so I must have . Although a lot of my friends managed to ride out the waning years of the draft in the National Guard . " " Were you in Vietnam ? " Her voice was hushed , and she looked at him with renewed respect . 146 KAREN ROBARDS  | He grinned again . " No , but I sweated it for a while there . Just about the time I got out of basic , they started bringing troops home . I was never so thankful for anything in my life . I spent most of my hitch in North Carolina . Which meant I kinda lost my chance to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't die . " " That 's how I 've always looked at it . " " Did you  --  are you married ? " " Divorced . " His tone was easy . No roadblock went up at all . " When ? " " Three years ago . When my life went to hell in a handbasket . Along with everything else that happened , my wife left me . Took my daughter with her . " " You have a daughter ? " Somehow the idea that he might be some-one 's dad had n't occurred to her . " Yep . She 's thirteen now . I 've seen her exactly three times since she was ten . " The bitterness in his voice told her how sensitive the topic was . " She does n't want to see me . Blames me for everything that happened , including the divorce . Says I ruined her life . The kids at school make fun of her because she 's my kid . " " I 'm sorry . " Her own memories of the past dulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah . Me too . " " So your wife divorced you over  --  what happened ? " Trying to be delicate , Summer 's tongue stumbled over the last words . " You mean my little bout with adultery ? Oh , yeah . " " I 'm sorry , " Summer said again . The words were inadequate , she knew , but she could come up with nothing better . " I 'm not . Not anymore , not about the divorce . We were never good for each other . She used to tell me I never really loved her , and she was right . " " Did you meet her in North Carolina ? " He shook his head . " Elaine 's from Nashville . I met her after I got out of the Marines . She was two years younger than me , and we were married for eleven years . Maybe three of ' em good ones . She used to be jealous of every woman I said two words to . And I never cheated once , I swear on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed off . Summer understood what he did n't say . " What was her name ? " WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 147  | His glance at her was unreadable . He did n't pretend not to know whom she meant . " Deedee . " " Did you love her ? " " Deedee ? " He was quiet for a moment , his eyes reflective . " I was crazy about her from the time we were teenagers . Then I finally got what I 'd been hankering after for twenty-two years  --  she and I in a red-hot affair  --  and it was n't what I expected at all . We were oil and water , not compatible a bit . But I loved her . Yeah , I loved her . In the end , it was n't enough . Not for me . And not for her . " The raw anguish in his voice as he finished warned her to leave the subject alone . When Frankenstein suddenly busied himself by breaking one last hot dog into pieces for Muffy , she tactfully got to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about heeding nature 's call . When she returned , he did n't look up at first . He was squatting by the fire , his attention focused on feeding sticks to the flames . As she watched him without , she thought , his being aware of it , he picked up a freshly opened beer that was waiting beside him and took an enormous swig . Summer remembered what he had said about being an alcoholic , and felt a twinge of alarm . He must have felt her eyes on him then , because he glanced around . Her gaze went involuntarily to the beer can he still held . Knowing that she watched , he put the can to his lips and took another long swallow . " Quit worrying , " he advised her when he was done , wiping the back of his hand across his mouth . " You would n't want me to die of thirst out here in the wilderness , would you ? " He grinned suddenly at the expression on her face . " Besides , it 's water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In that case , I hope you do n't get dysentery . " It was hard to keep her tone as light as she knew it needed to be . She felt such enormous sympathy for him that it took a huge amount of dissembling not to let it show . He would hate it if he guessed she felt sorry for him . Summer knew it instinctively , as surely as she knew that in life there would always be taxes and death . Her flippant rejoinder made him grimace . " Jesus , I never thought about that . " " Too late now . " 148 KAREN ROBARDS  | Without warning , Summer yawned so widely that her jaws cracked . With her stomach full , she was out on her feet . She needed sleep in the worst way . Then she glanced at Frankenstein , suddenly ill at ease . He was busy repacking their remaining supply of food , wrapping it in the white plastic bag and then unzipping the gym bag , to , she assumed , stow it away . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like bedtime for you , Bonzo . " Bedtime for Bonzo , indeed . She was agreeable . There was just one teensy little problem . They only had one quilt between them . And she was wearing it .  | Need some jammies ? " Frankenstein fished in the gym bag and held out something . Summer recognized her own Daisy Fresh uniform with relief . The clothes might be less than fresh , but at least they were clothes . She would n't have to sleep naked after all . " Thanks . " Summer accepted the garments and retired behind a rock to pull them on . Without underclothes , her bare bottom clung to the polyester pants , and her breasts hung unconfined beneath the thin nylon of the blouse . Glancing down , Summer saw that her nipples thrust visibly against the cloth . She pulled the quilt back around herself , and felt better . Not quite so hideously exposed . When she emerged from behind the boulder , she saw that he had zipped himself into the hooded sweatshirt and dragged the gym bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched out flat on his back with his head resting on the bag and his arms crossed over his chest . His eyes were closed . They flickered open as Summer hesitantly approached . " Good night , " he said . Summer watched in disbelief as his eyes closed again . From the sound of his breathing , within seconds he was asleep . Good night ? 150 KAREN ROBARDS  | Clearly she did not have to fear the consequences of sharing a quilt with him . He was quite content , no , eager from the look of him , to sleep alone , braving the chill night air rather than share a quilt with her . He had not been so particular earlier in the day . Had he somehow divined that she was growing increasingly attracted to him ? Did he fear being attacked in his sleep ? Summer 's face burned . She glanced around at the darkness outside the flickering circle of light cast by the fire and shivered . Anything could be out there . Nevertheless , she was not going to debase herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closer , Summer dropped to her knees , brushed a reasonably grassy spot free of rocks and twigs , and lay down . Clicking her tongue at Muffy , she swooped the dog up when she approached and cuddled her close beneath the quilt . Muffy sighed and snuggled . Summer no longer felt quite so alone . Closing her eyes , she willed herself to go to sleep . Paradoxically , now that she wanted to , Summer found that she could not . Curled into a fetal position not far from the fire  --  or Frank-enstein 's feet with a wad of quilt for a pillow , Summer tried everything to make herself drowsy , from counting sheep to imagining the flowers she would plant in next summer 's garden . Nothing worked . Her mind was awake and busy ; her emotions seesawed between affront at Frankenstein 's lack of interest and fear at her surroundings . Frankenstein had not even so much as shot her a suggestive look all through their meal . He must have known she was naked beneath the quilt , but clearly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Summer 's eyes snapped open . What was that sound ? Glancing around , she could see nothing moving outside of the dancing flames and Frankenstein 's rhythmically rising and falling chest . Beyond the small circle of light cast by the fire , the darkness was impenetrable . The sound must have been made by an animal  --  a small animal , she hoped  --  somewhere far away in the woods . Her lids started to droop again . Why had n't Frankenstein made a pass at her ? Most men , given the circumstances , would n't have hesitated . Had anxiety over their predicament sapped his sex drive ? Was he too blamed tired after their endless trek ? The thought that he was too much of a gentleman to take advantage WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 151  | of the situation occurred to her , only to be dismissed with an inner hoot . Frankenstein a gentleman ? She did n't think so . Crack ! What was that ? Summer 's eyes sprang open again . Once again there was nothing to be seen except the rocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath her chin , fast asleep . Her fur tickled Summer 's nose , but not for anything would she have evicted her sleeping partner . Though the comfort Summer took from the dog 's proximity was largely illusory and she knew it , still it made her feel better to have Muffy near . If there was a bear prowling nearby , how much help would Muffy be ? At least she would bark , Summer told herself . I hope , honesty compelled her to add . In her experience , Muffy barked only when trying to make herself clear on the subject of food . Oh , well , maybe she would think a prowling bear was something to eat . More likely the bear would decide to make a meal of Muffy . Summer 's lids closed again . Sleep , she ordered herself . Sleep . With the best will in the world , though , sleep would not come . Was she just not Frankenstein 's type ? she wondered . Did he not find her attractive ? Men used to fall all over themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Despite his joking comment to the contrary , Frankenstein probably did prefer firm-bodied , empty-headed twenty-year-olds . A thirty-six-year-old woman with crow 's feet and a soft , wellrounded body might not turn him on . Most men did n't have the sense to prefer hard-earned wisdom and a measure of life experience to blind , giggly adoration , either . The bottom line was that most men thought with their dicks . Clearly Frankenstein 's dick was not thinking of her . Which , Summer told herself fiercely , was just fine with her . And on that note she finally fell asleep . Sometime later , a hoarse cry jerked her awake . Summer sat bolt upright , heart pounding . It was still dark as pitch . Had she been asleep long ? She had no idea . All she knew was that she was suddenly scared to death . Someone had screamed . Glancing around , she saw that Frankenstein was on his hands and 152 KAREN ROBARDS  | knees , face ashen , staring fixedly at a point just beyond the fire . It did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakened her had come from him . " What is it ? What 's wrong ? " Visions of bear attack danced in her head as , dragging the quilt and Muffy with her , she scrambled across the few feet of rocky ground that separated them . Frankenstein did n't even glance at her as her shoulder and hip butted against his side . " Look  --  look there ! " He pointed into the darkness . Summer looked , but saw nothing except the shadowy images of swaying branches . Like him , she was on all fours . Side by side , they stared at something just beyond the light . " What ? What is it ? " Summer 's heart pounded . Her throat grew dry as she searched the shifting shadows for whatever menaced them . To put such fear into Frankenstein , it had to be a werewolf , at least . Or the bad guys . " Do n't you  --  ca n't you see her ? " His voice was hoarse , horror-filled . " Who ? See who ? " Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the direction he pointed . Whatever kind of danger lurked just beyond her sight , if it was awful enough to horrify Frankenstein then it was awful enough to horrify her . She was ready , willing , and able to be terrified on faith alone . " Deedee . " The name emerged as a croak . Deedee ? Who was Deedee ? Gasping with fear as her eyes bored a hole through the night , Summer tried to remember . Was n't Deedee the name of the woman who . . . ? " Deedee 's dead ! " she burst out . " Do n't you think I know that ? " The look he turned on her was savage . " But she 's here  --  look ! Oh , my God , she 's here ! " He sounded shaken . Glancing at his face rather than the empty night , Summer realized that he must have had a nightmare . Of course , that was the explanation . The only explanation . Come to think of it , he 'd had one before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giddy with relief , she sank back on her haunches . " Damn it , look at the dog ! " The urgency in his voice brought her up on her hands and knees again . Knowing it was ridiculous , Summer looked  --  and felt cold chills race down her spine . Muffy stood just inside the ring of light , tail and ears erect , staring at exactly the same spot where Frankenstein 's gaze was fixed . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 153  | The same spot where he claimed to see the long-dead Deedee . Could both of them really be seeing a ghost ? Nonsense ! There was no such thing . If there 's something strange . . In the shadows beyond the fire , something was taking shape . Sum-mer 's eyes widened . Her breath stopped . Beside her , Frankenstein was as still as stone . Like hers , his attention was riveted on whatever was moving about just beyond the circle of light . Muffy stood with ears and tail alert , staring . ... in your neighborhood / Who ya gon na @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , truly , about to see a real , live ( or whatever ) ghost ? There  --  she was not mistaken  --  a solid shape had materialized just beyond the light and was moving toward them . Ghostbusters ! Muffy yapped , Summer screamed , Frankenstein yelped , and the thing took flight . Summer watched , mesmerized , as a trio of white-tailed deer leaped in almost perfect unison over their campsite and fled into the night . " Jesus . " Frankenstein was breathing hard . He glanced back at the spot that had so fixated him before . " She 's gone . " Spell broken , he collapsed on his back , his hands pressed to his face . Summer knelt at his side . " What do you mean , she 's gone ? Of course she 's gone . She was never there . You idiot , you scared the stuffing out of me . " Summer punched him in the arm . She had been so frightened that her breathing was still unsteady . " Hey , that hurt ! " Frankenstein caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him again . " I have a bruise there ! " " It was a bad dream ! " " A bad dream . " Frankenstein 's hands tightened around hers . She met his eyes and saw that they looked haunted . " You did n't see any-thing ? " " I saw some deer . " " Jesus . " " You had a nightmare . " " I think I 'm losing my mind . " He closed his eyes . " You do n't believe in  --  ghosts ? " Summer shook her head , though of course he could n't see . " Do n't be silly . " 154 KAREN ROBARDS WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 155  | " That 's how I feel . " He groaned . " So why do I keep seeing Deedee ? " " You 've seen her before ? " " Yeah . Oh , yeah . " His eyes opened again . " When ? " The look Frankenstein gave her was shuttered . " Before . " " When you cried out in your sleep earlier , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a bad dream . Just like tonight was a bad dream . What you have to ask yourself is , what brought it on ? " Frankenstein laughed , sounding unamused . " That part I think I 've managed to figure out . " " Oh , yeah ? " " Yeah . " Summer waited , but he did n't seem inclined to be more forthcoming . " So tell me . " " Rosencrans , believe me , you do n't want to know . " " Yes , I do . " There was a sudden glint in his eyes . " Sure ? " " Sure . " " Positive ? " " Would you quit being ridiculous and tell me ? " " Okay . Remember , you asked for it . " His hands shifted to her wrists , shackling her . " I only see Deedee when I get a hard-on . " " What ? " Summer could n't believe her ears . " You heard me . And I only get a hard-on when I think about making it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hung on . No wonder he was gripping her wrists so tightly ! He was worried about being punched again ! And with good reason ! " You no-good , lying , aggravating son of a ... " " I 'm telling God 's own truth , " he said , and moved one of her clenched fists down to rest atop his fly to prove it . Summer went suddenly very still . Beneath the tight , zipped-up denim , the rock-hard bulge was unmistakable . " See ? " he asked softly . And he was n't laughing . Summer met his gaze and caught her breath . The passion that burned for her in those deadly black eyes was real . " Frankenstein ? "  | " I think you 'd better call me Steve , " he said with a suggestion of a laugh , and drew her down into his arms . Summer went willingly , lying across his chest as his arms slid around her back . Her own arms crept around his neck . " Steve , " she breathed , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's better , " he said , and rolled over with her , so that she was lying on her back and he was leaning above her , propped on his elbows . Hands on his shoulders , Summer looked up into that bruised , battered , decidedly unhandsome face , and felt her insides turn to jelly . Then Steve lowered his head and kissed her .  | This time the earth moved . Bells rang . Stars exploded in Summer 's head . His mouth was hard and hot and , surprisingly , very gentle . His tongue touched her lips , slid between her parted teeth , and claimed her mouth . A warm , strong hand found her left breast , closing over it through the thin nylon . Summer 's senses swam . Shaking , she kissed him back with abandon , eyes closed , arms locked around his neck . When his hands parted the ravaged edges of her blouse to stroke her bare breasts , Summer arched her back to offer him greater access . When his mouth left hers to slide down her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of his head , pulling him closer as he switched his attention from one eager nipple to the other . Never in her life had she felt passion like this . Impatient with his clothes , her hands wormed under his sweatshirt and muscle shirt to clutch his back . His skin was warm , smooth . The muscles beneath were strong . Summer stroked those hard contours , glorying in his strength . Her palms slid down along his spine to burrow beneath the waistband of his cutoffs . " Jesus . " Frankenstein  --  Steve  --  pulled away , sitting up suddenly and yanking both shirts over his head in a single fluid movement . Summer looked at his broad shoulders , at the wide expanse of his chest with its wedge of curly black hair , at the hollow of his throat and WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 157  | his flat male nipples and the neat circle of his navel spilling over the waistband of his shorts , and felt her mouth go dry . She wanted him . Oh , how she wanted him ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brushing his hands aside , Summer freed it herself . Then she found the metal tab of his zipper and pulled it down . Hiding coyly beneath the white cotton of his Jockey shorts , the burgeoning evidence of his desire for her thrust through the open V of the zipper . Summer caught her breath , and ran her forefinger down the length of the bulge . " Rosencrans , you 're blowing my mind , " he said . Then , before she could even think about reminding him that under the circumstances her name was Summer , for heaven 's sake , he was on top of her , his mouth on hers , his hands between them fumbling for the fastening of her slacks . There was no fastening . The cheap polyester pants had an elastic waist . Discovering that , he moved on . His hand slid down inside her pants , over her soft stomach to the nest of hair between her legs . Summer forgot to breathe as he caressed her with knowing fingers . He found the small nub that ached for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost mindless . She was spiraling higher and higher .. . All at once he froze . His fingers stilled at their task . His body , which had been pressing rhythmically against hers , went rigid . Summer whimpered , writhed , thrust herself pleadingly against his hand , begging him without words to continue . He did n't move . Her eyes opened . He was not looking at her . With his hand down her pants and his arm around her back and her body quaking beneath him , pantingly available for his delectation , his head was raised and he was staring off into the dark . " Steve . . . " Summer whispered , lifting herself a few inches off the ground to press her bare breasts suggestively against his chest . The contact between her throbbing nipples and his hard , hair-roughened muscles felt so good that for a few seconds she almost forgot he was n't paying attention . " She 's clapping , " he said suddenly . " What ? " Entwining her arms around his neck , flattening her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck . 158 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Jesus H. Christ , I 've got to get out of here . " Pulling her arms from around his neck , Steve leaped to his feet and zipped up his shorts . " What ? " Summer fell back to earth and stared up at him , bewil-dered . " Come on , we 've got to go . " " What are you talking about ? " she wailed . He snatched his muscle shirt from the ground and pulled it over his head . " Put that on , " he said , throwing the hooded sweatshirt at her . " What is wrong with you ? " Sitting up , Summer regarded him with disbelief . He was bundling up the quilt and stuffing it inside the gym bag . " Damn it , will you get dressed ? " His glanced raked over her . Summer was very conscious suddenly of how she must look , black-poly-ester-clad bottom planted in the dirt , her blouse hanging open so that her ripe , rose-crested breasts were bare to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes no doubt bright with passion . Slutty . That was the word she was hunting for . Embarrassed suddenly , she drew the edges of her blouse together , fastened the few remaining buttons , then reached for the sweatshirt and zipped herself into that for good measure . " Here . Hurry up . " While she was thus occupied , he had retrieved her damp clothes from the branches where they 'd been hung to dry . The here was uttered as he dropped her shoes and socks beside her . Summer blinked at them with disbelief as he bundled her bra and panties inside her shorts and shirt , and stuffed them into the bag . " You 've got to be kidding . We 're really going ? " " Get your shoes on ! " It was a muted roar . Hostility radiated from him like rays from the sun . " Well , screw you , Frankenstein ! " Outraged , Summer snatched up the still-damp socks and yanked them over her feet . He was pulling on his own sneakers as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even her outrage did n't seem to touch him . It was if he had switched off  --  no , forgotten , really  --  the passion that still pulsed through her veins with a life of its own . " I ' 11 carry the dog . Let 's go . " On his feet now , Bulls cap firmly on his head , Frankenstein kicked dirt over the fire . Then , to Summer 's burgeoning fury , he headed off into the dark without another word to her , or even so much as a glance over his shoulder to make sure she was following . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 159  | How dare he treat her so badly ? Summer fumed as she stomped after him . Not quite having the nerve to teach him a lesson by stomping in the opposite direction doubled her anger . To jump up in the middle of the most explosive lovemaking session she had ever experienced and run off into the night for no good reason that she could discover was about the most infuriating behavior she had ever encoun-tered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . With Frankenstein in the lead and setting a killing pace , they plunged down gulleys and up hillsides , skirted piles of fallen rock and one very pungent cloud of eau de skunk , all in the pitch-dark . The ground grew squishy beneath the fallen leaves as they passed an underground spring , and patches of mud sucked at Summer 's shoes . Branches creaked eerily with every passing breeze . The sharp smell of pine needles and the more muted scents of earth , leaves , and mold replaced the smell of skunk . Finally the sun rose , and misty wisps of vapor floated up lazily to greet it . Fingers of fog crept through the woods and kept going . Birds trilled . The cicadas sang . Dawn gave way to full morning , and gradually the air warmed . The droplets of moisture that had sparkled in the sunlight like jewels beneath the trees dried up . Squirrels came out to breakfast . Summer wanted breakfast . Ahead of her , Muffy tucked under his arm like a football , Frankenstein just kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blasted Energizer Bunny . She knew what ailed him , now that she had had time to think the whole fiasco through . Right in the middle of making love to her , he had imagined that he saw Deedee again . Which did n't sit in her craw very well at all , any way she looked at it . Eyeing his broad back evilly , Summer began to hum . If there 's something strange .. . Since she had met him , that idiotic tune had practically become her theme song . As she followed him , she hummed . He walked . She hummed a little louder . Still he walked . She hummed very loudly indeed . Back stiffening , he started to slow down . " ... in your neighborhood / Who ya gon na call ? " She was singing now , softly . But the words were unmistakable . Frankenstein stopped walking and pivoted to glare at her . 160 KAREN ROBARDS  | Summer stopped too , cocked her head to one side , grinned , and continued : " Ghostbusters ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na na na na na ! " " Are you making fun of me ? " He sounded as if he could n't believe she would dare . " Me ? " Summer stopped singing and shook her head , trying to look innocent . He stared at her hard for a moment , then swung around and started off again . Summer started after him . " If there 's something strange ... " " Would you please stop singing that damned song ? " Annoyance was plain in the glance he threw over his shoulder at her . He sounded as if he were struggling very hard to hold on to his temper . " I 'm sorry . I did n't realize it would bother you , " Summer said , saccharine-sweet . When he was face-forward again , she added wickedly , " I ai n't afraid of no ghosts ! " " Damn it , Rosencrans ! Shut the hell up ! " Having apparently given up on holding on to his temper , he practically vibrated with anger as he wheeled to face her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can just quit laughing , too . " " I 'll laugh anytime I damned well please . And I 'll sing if I want to , too , " she answered cordially , and took up singing again . " Would you stop ? " he roared . Muffy started at the sudden explosion of sound , and with an impatient glance he set her on the ground . Summer , from the safety of a good ten feet away , kept singing . " Na na na na na na na ! " " Damn it , Rosencrans , I 'm warning you ! " His fists were balled on his hips and his eyes shot warning sparks at her . " Why does that song bother you ? " she asked , grinning . " Just because you think you 're being haunted by your own private ghost is no reason to take it personally . " " Why , you ? " He bit off a word that Summer was certain was most uncomplimentary , but his eyes said it for him . His fists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loosely down at his sides , his fingers flexing and unflexing as if he ached to wrap them around her neck . Bared by the sleeveless shirt , the muscles of his bare arms tensed until they bulged like the rolling hillsides they had just traversed . The brim of his Bulls cap shaded his eyes . Summer knew that by referring to his obsession with Deedee , she could be accused of hitting below the belt , but she did n't care . It was WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 161  | time that Mr. Macho Man realized how ridiculous the whole ghost bit was . " I ai n't afraid of no ghosts , " she sang tauntingly . Steam practically came out of his ears . His whole body tensed . " That 's enough , Rosencrans , " he said through his teeth . Summer grinned at him . " If there 's something strange / In your neighborhood / Who ya gon na call ? Ghostbusters ! Na na na ? " She never made it through the last few nas . With a bellow of rage he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her . With a shriek , Summer turned to run . She had n't made it two paces before his hand closed around the back of her neck . " Feeling brave , are you ? " he asked as he whirled her around to face him , his hands on her shoulders . " Go on , sing it again . I dare you . " Summer looked up into the hard , furious , bruised and battered face . She saw the danger signals in the snapping black eyes and the tight-clenched jaw . And she lifted her chin and started to sing , " If there 's something strange . . . " His hands tightened on her shoulders threateningly . His black eyes blazed . If ever a man had had murder written all over him , at that moment Frankenstein was that man .  | Summer was unimpressed . " What are you going to do , strangle me ? " " By God , I 'd like to .

" It was a growl of pure rage , and for a moment Summer was almost afraid . His hands tightened on her shoulders  --  and then he jerked her against him , tilted her head back with one hand imbedded in her hair , and brought his mouth crushing down on hers . It was the first time she had ever been kissed by a man wearing a Bulls cap . There was symbolism in there somewhere , she was sure . Summer opened her mouth to take a deep , shaken breath , and his tongue invaded the warm , sweet cavity like a conquering army . Her knees quivered at the onslaught . Her head was forced back . Her mouth was being mercilessly , ferociously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world she could do to stop it . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 163  | That being so , her arms slid up around his neck . This was why she had taunted him so mercilessly . This was what she wanted . " Steve . . . " she whispered into his mouth . Then she was kissing him back with a passion hotter than any fire . His arms slid around her back , her shoulders , crushing her to him . " God , Rosencrans , " he groaned in answer , and a small laugh shook her as she twisted in his arms to pull her mouth free . " Summer , " she told him , her lips just inches from his . " My name is Summer . " " Summer , " he murmured obligingly while his eyes blazed down into hers . A faint smile curved his mouth . " Beautiful , sexy Summer . " Entranced beyond words , Summer lifted one hand from its death grip on his shoulder to lightly stroke the rough hair at the nape of his neck . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to the ground . He did n't appear to notice . His eyes remained fixed on hers . " Kiss me , Steve , " she whispered , her mouth reaching for his again even as she spoke . Plastered against him , she felt him shudder . She heard the sudden , harsh indrawing of his breath as she touched his mouth with hers . Then something happened . He glanced up , growing still , holding himself a little away from her . Summer could feel the sudden resistance in his body . Deedee . Was he having visions of Deedee ? She meant to wipe Deedee clean out of his head . " Steve  --  kiss me . Please . " Shameless . That 's what she was  --  shameless . But she wanted him , fiercely , hungrily , more than she had ever wanted anything in her whole life . And she was willing to fight for what she wanted . With one hand burrowing through his short crisp hair , she pulled his head down . She brushed her lips against his , softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She caressed his teeth and the roof of his mouth with her tongue . She touched his tongue with hers , stroked it , tried to coax it to come out to play . She nibbled at his lips . And still he did n't respond . She rubbed her pelvis up and down against the hard bulge in his pants . He drew in a harsh , shaken breath , and suddenly he was looking at her again . Torment blazed from his eyes . " Make love to me , " she whispered . " Pretty please . " I 164 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Oh , God , I want to , " he groaned , as if the admission condemned him to eternal hellfire . When she lifted her face he took her mouth . It was a kiss so devouring that Summer closed her eyes and surrendered her soul . She 'd won . She knew it . Top this , girl , she taunted the absent Deedee even as her consciousness reeled under the onslaught of her senses and then stopped being heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast . Summer could feel the heat and strength of it even through the layers of her sweatshirt and blouse . She arched her back , clinging close , trembling all over . He bent her back over his arm , kissing her as if he could never get enough of the taste of her mouth . Shuddering jolts of electricity rocketed through her body as he unzipped the sweatshirt and brushed it aside and then jerked open her blouse . When his hand closed over her bare breast she gasped at the sheer pleasure of it . Her nipple was stiff beneath his cupping palm . He tweaked it lightly between his thumb and forefinger . Summer gasped into his devouring mouth . Only her arms wrapped around his neck held her upright as he abandoned his hold on her waist to cup her breasts with both hands . His mouth ate hers greedily as his hand stroked and molded , cupped and caressed . Summer felt as if she were falling . She was falling . No , she was rising , being swept off her feet in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms . Summer opened her eyes to find his bruised jaw hard and taut and his black eyes alight as he carried her off through the trees cradled against his hard chest . Pressing her mouth to the bristly underside of his chin , Summer clung to his wide shoulders and surrendered to the unaccustomed sensation of feeling small and helpless and entirely feminine . He carried her easily , as easily as if she weighed nothing at all . She 'd known he was strong , but this display of effortless he-manism was impressive . His strength turned her on . She did n't say a word . She could n't because she was beyond speech . But her eyes spoke for her . They were heavy-lidded with passion , alight with desire . She was alight with de-sire . She had never felt this way about any man in her life . To find herself , at thirty-six , gaga over Frankenstein was incredible . Clinging to him , Summer held tightly as he walked yards into the trees , until the delicate scent of flowers reached her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found a leafy bower . Kudzu , the WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 165  | invasive Japanese vine that was rapidly overrunning the south , covered the ground and the underbrush and the trunks of trees and everything else that did not move on a regular basis for as far as the eye could see . Creamy honeysuckle trumpets burst through the conquerer , winding upward around the lower branches of a circle of sturdy elms . The homely golden faces of dandelions appeared here and there across the carpet of vines . Vivid purple violets nestled cozily amidst the ground cover . Summer caught her breath as Steve bent to lay her down in a bed of flowers and dark green leaves . As a romantic setting , she thought , it was perfect . He could n't have done better if he had ordered it from central casting . Then he came down on top of her , and she quit thinking altogether . His kiss was hard and hot and slow , and almost unbearably sexy . It made the blood pound in her ears . When he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm hard as a spike , " he murmured , smoothing her hair back from her face with hands that were less than steady . " So what are you going to do about it ? " she whispered back with a tiny , tremulous smile . " What do you want me to do ? " " This . " Summer took his hand and placed it on her breast . She pressed his hand to her , loving the warmth of his strong , masculine palm . Her nipple swelled almost painfully beneath his touch . " Ah , " he said . He watched her intently as his hand caressed her softness . The feel of his hand against her skin made her want to writhe . She wanted to feel it everywhere on her body  --  wanted to feel him everywhere on her body . She wanted him to make love to her until she begged him to stop . She remembered how he had touched her before , remembered the ecstasy he had given her with only his caressing fingers , and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wanted him to touch her there . " Is that all ? " His voice was hoarse , but a funny kind of half-smile quirked his mouth . How could he smile when she was going out of her mind for want of him ? She meant to drive him out of his mind , too . " No , " she whispered , and caught his wrist , sliding his hand down . " I want you to touch me here , too . " She put his hand between her legs . He sucked in his breath . It was a rough , ragged-sounding inhalation. 166 KAREN ROBARDS  | " And I want to touch you here . " Her voice was soft , barely above a whisper . Husky with desire . Her hand went to the front of his shorts . Closing her hand over his straining flesh , denim and all , she squeezed . " Baby , you go right ahead .

Through the barrier of black polyester his mouth pressed against the V between her legs and his hands closed over her bottom , his fingers seeking out and tracing the crevice between her soft cheeks . Summer stopped breathing as he opened his mouth against the rough cloth covering the apex of her legs . Her heart pounded so hard it sounded like a jackhammer in her ears . She could feel the damp heat of his mouth burning her through the polyester . He opened his mouth more , pressing his lips and tongue and teeth against her , nibbling at her , biting her . Summer moaned , her fists clenching on the cool crispness of kudzu and violets , releasing the flowers ' haunting scent to dance with the aroma of honeysuckle and sex in the air . Steve lifted his head for an instant and met her gaze , wildfire in his eyes . Then he yanked her pants down around her knees and repeated the exercise , finding the the secret nub that ached and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wet slither of his tongue . Summer cried out . Of their own volition her thighs tried to part , to give him greater access to the part of her that wept for want of him , but her pants bound her at the knees . She lay flat , crushed by his weight , helpless to do anything to relieve her sweet agony as he brought her to the brink of ecstasy and beyond without even parting her legs . " Oh , stop . Do n't stop . " Summer 's hands closed into tight fists on the short strands of his hair , meaning to pull his head away . He reached up , caught her wrists , and brought them down , pinning them to the ground on either side of her undulating hips . She was left utterly defenseless . He was turning her into a writhing , needful , hungry object , reducing her to an abject , pleading thing . " Do n't stop !

Made it unbearable , in fact . Never in her life had she imagined feeling anything like this . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 167  | She came with a shudder that made her cry out , and brought her arching up off her bed of leaves to press against his mouth . When it was over , when she was herself again , Summer opened her eyes to find him watching her . His black eyes glittered , his battered face was hard and set , and his lips were fused into a straight , implacable line . " Now it 's my turn , " he said , and then he was on his knees above her . With quick , savage movements he removed her shoes and socks , yanked her pants the rest of the way down her legs , extracted her from her blouse , pulled his shirt over his head and shucked his shoes and shorts and briefs .

He was urgent and she was willing , but her own urgency was spent . Or so she thought , until he kissed her breathless and suckled her breasts and parted her legs with his thighs . He let her feel him , hard and hot and pulsing , just touching the place where he could enter anytime he chose . But he chose not to come in . Instead he played with her until she was once again as taut and quivering as the overtightened string of a violin . Then he entered . Slowly . He was hard and fiery hot and filled her to bursting .

She would have done anything he wanted . Anything .. . She told him so . His hands braced on either side of her rib cage , he stiffened his arms until his weight was almost completely off her . Their only point of contact was where their bodies joined . Slowly he moved in , then out , then in again , until she lifted her hips with involuntary anticipation each time . Then he bent his head and took a swollen nipple in his mouth . Summer groaned . He lifted his head and smiled then , a slow smile that acknowledged 168 KAREN ROBARDS  | her passion , relished it , and promised more . The smoldering depths of his black eyes held all the knowing wickedness of the serpent . " Steve . . . " she whimpered , pleading for an end .

It was a long , long time before he roused himself enough to roll away .   " The soul , like the body , lives by what it feeds on . " ? Josiah Gilbert Holland She was starting to get the hang of this ghost thing , Deedee realized . At first it was disorienting to be always popping up here , there , and everywhere , without , she thought , much rhyme or reason . She 'd found herself in the living room of her childhood home again , where she discovered her mother and her aunt Dot , who had lived together since both were widowed within a twelve-month span eight years before , trying to contact her via , of all things , a Ouija board . " I tell you I saw her . Just as plain as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not sayin ' you did n't , Sue . All I 'm sayin ' is , this Ouija board ai n't pickin ' her up . " " Maybe you just do n't know how to use it . " " I 've been usin ' Ouija boards all of my life , so I guess I know how to use one . A Ouija is what advised me to marry Jett , you know , when I would 've taken Carl Owens . " " That do n't recommend ' em much to me , " her mother said . Indeed , Aunt Dot 's fights with Uncle Jett were legendary . Deedee had almost forgotten about them . This time , try though she might , she could n't seem to materialize . But she could take control of the pointer . " I-M-O-K-A-Y . . . " 170 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Would you look at that ? " " Are you pushin ' that thing , Dorothy Jean ? " " You know I would n't do that ! Oh , my heavens ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deedee ! It 's my baby ! Deedee , Deedee ! " " Sue , calm down ! Sue , ask her what happened that night ! Ask her , quick ! " Deedee 's mother and aunt , work-reddened , unlovely hands poised on either side of the plastic pointer , frantically pushed the felt-tipped wedge around the board . But Deedee was already being sucked away . When next she surfaced it was on a Nashville soundstage . A pretty blonde of maybe twenty-five , wearing headphones and a scarlet mini , was crooning into a microphone . Deedee found herself watching the singer from the Plexiglas-walled control booth , where two men listened , frowning , to what Deedee considered a reed-thin voice . " We need more volume out of her , Bill . " " Well , we ai n't gon na get it . That 's everything she 's got . It does n't matter , anyway . We can fix it . Hell , with the equipment we 've got we can fix anything . " " She 's scheduled to sing on Nashville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bullet . Nobody 's ever heard her sing live before . The critics are gon na be after her with knives if we do n't get her to punch it up . " " Hell , I would if I could , and you know it . This little gal 's pretty , and she sings okay , but you and I both know she never would 've got the first whiff of a recording contract if she was n't married to Hank Ketchum . " " You got ta admit , marryin ' the head of Jalapeno Records was one hell of a career move . Too bad I did n't think of it . " " I do n't think he would 've proposed , in your case . Anyway , Ketchum signs our paychecks , so we 'd best shut up . " Bill pressed a button and spoke into a mike . " Hallie , honey , try to hold those high notes just a little longer , would you ? And see if you can put more emotion into it . Pretend your dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bill . " " Thanks , Hallie . That 's all I ask . Wan na take it from the top ? " " Okay . " Bill pushed the mike button again , signaled to the musicians , and  | sank back in his chair . " For Nashville Live , we 're just gon na have to surround her with a lot of background singers , and hope for the best . " " Hurtin ' , I 'm hurtin ' so bad over you What did you think I would do ? " The two men in the control booth came erect in their seats , stared hard at the blonde at the mike , and looked at each other in disbelief . " Well , bust my britches ! The girl can sing ! " " Hot damn ! We 're in business ! " Onstage , Deedee fought to retain control over the vocal cords she had appropriated , and gave the song her best . Following the words on the TelePrompTer , singing from the depths of her soul , she felt closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life  --  or death . Just lie down and die  --  that 's not me Still , I am in agony . " As the last notes died away , Deedee felt the familiar sensation of being sucked away . Vainly she tried to hold on . She wanted to stay ... . The voice boomed out of the control room . " Hallie , honey , that was just fine ! Just fine ! " Once again in control of her vocal cords , Hallie answered breathlessly , " Thanks Bill . Something just came over me ... " But Deedee missed the rest of the exchange . She was hurtling through the maelstrom once more . When she came to rest again it was night , and she was in a small , tidy country cemetery . Her husband was crouched beside a grave . Perched cross-legged atop the tombstone , Deedee leaned way for-ward  --  being a ghost allowed her to do that kind of thing without falling on her nose , she had discovered  --  and read the inscription : TAYLOR DEIDRA ANN CUMMINS porn JANUARY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is Eternal 172 KAREN ROBARDS  | Mitch was crouched beside her grave . Deedee regarded the bent blond head and wondered if Mitch had thought up the inscription . She guessed so ; it sounded like Mitch . Certainly her mother would never have come up with anything so poetic . She had loved Mitch desperately from the time she was thirteen until almost the moment she died . They 'd had their ups and downs ? some ups , a whole lot of downs  --  but she had always loved him . Now she looked at him with fresh vision . Love really was n't eternal . At least , not in this case . Mitch glanced up then , and for a moment Deedee wondered if he could see her . She had n't felt the tingling that signaled when she had materialized , and he did n't scream or faint or even turn pale , so she guessed he could n't . But she could see him . He was as handsome as ever , his blond hair wavy , his blue eyes keen , his lightly tanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since she 'd last seen him , but then at six feet one he 'd always been lean , so she could n't be sure . Kneeling beside her grave , dressed in slacks and a windbreaker , he was the very picture of the grieving widower . Except for the fact that his hands were covered with earth . A shovel lay beside him , and her grave , while thick with grass , looked raw , somehow . Too raw for a three-year-old grave . It had been freshly sodded . What 're you up to , Mitch Taylor ? she thought fiercely . Even as she felt the tingling , even as his eyes widened , she was sucked away . This time , when she stopped , it was a hot , sunlit afternoon . At least , it was hot and sunlit outside . She was in a cave , floating up near the ceiling , staring down at a sleeping couple entwined in a quilt on the ground about six feet below . The man was Steve  --  his face still looked like hell ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty cozy together . Deedee was watching them with interest when Steve opened his eyes . He saw her . She could tell right away . So she waved at him , just to say hi . He let out a bellow and sat up . Startled , Deedee lost control of her atoms and vanished . When she got hold of herself again , she was in a corner of the same cave being stared at by a weird-looking little dog . Steve was once WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 173  | again lying down , with the woman cuddled on his chest . Steve was awake . The woman was n't . The woman definitely was n't Steve 's wife , Elaine . That was kinda surprising . Except for the fling with her , Steve had always been a straight arrow . Deedee doubted if he 'd ever cheated on Elaine before . She would have added " or since , " but evidence to the contrary was right under her nose . Despite the attraction she knew he 'd always felt for her , she had had to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit that she had done it deliberately , to teach Mitch a lesson . Mitch , who would unzip his pants with alacrity for any bitch in heat , had sorely needed a lesson . Her husband had been embroiled in another in his endless series of hot-and-heavy affairs when she 'd decided to get even with him by getting it on with Steve . After fourteen years of marriage , Deedee had grown wise to the ways of Mitch ; she knew all the signs . And she also knew that Steve was one of the few people on earth of whom her husband was genuinely fond . Mitch , handsome conniver and peopleuser that he was , generally stayed friends with people for just as long as he needed them . But his friendship with Steve had survived three decades . Between the two men there was a true bond . Steve , being Steve , had lost his head over her for about three weeks , and then started suffering the tortures of the damned . He could n't deal with the guilt of having cheated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . He 'd always been such a Boy Scout . Which was one reason she was so fond of him , Deedee supposed . She was n't in love with him , had n't ever been , but she loved him . Like a brother , or something . As the song  --  countless songs  --  said , she 'd done him wrong . Real bad wrong . That , she thought with a sudden flash of insight , was why she was still earthbound . She could n't go to Heaven until she had righted that wrong .  | teve lay facedown in kudzu , breathing in the scent of mold , feeling the damp chill of the ground beneath the vines seeping into his bones . He was almost afraid to look up . The last time he 'd checked , before he had completely lost his head , Deedee had been swinging from the branches of the huge elm just to the left of his outfiung hand , hanging upside down by her knees as she gave him a thumbs-up sign . Remembering , it was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing his mind . He had to be . Or maybe his subconscious was trying to tell him something . Maybe these recurring visions of Deedee were its way of reminding him to stay focused . His mission was twofold : First , he had to stay alive long enough to figure out exactly why everybody and his brother wanted to kill him and what to do about it ; and second , he had to discover how Deedee had gotten into his office that fateful night . Getting sidetracked by a woman was the last thing he needed . What man had ever been able to think straight when his brain was intoxicated with thoughts of pussy ? So they had had sex . Good . Maybe he 'd gotten it  --  and her  --  out of his system for a while . A soft , wet mouth nuzzled his ear . God , was she hot for him again WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 175  | already ? Steve wondered , and felt his member begin to stiffen in re-sponse . All right , so maybe he had n't gotten it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe he was already hankering after another go-round . He 'd get over it . He had to . Cool it , he cautioned himself sternly . At this moment , going all mushy-brained  --  and brick-dicked  --  over the woman could be the death of both of them . He was not going to allow himself to think of sex again until they were safe . He glanced up , scowling , to warn the temptress in no uncertain terms about the inadvisability of doing any more nibbling on his ear . The eyes he encountered were not a warm golden hazel , but chocolate brown and bulging . As he stared into them , the mutt to whom they belonged tilted its head inquiringly , panting with execrable doggy breath right in his face . With a shudder of revulsion , Steve realized just exactly who had been licking his ear : He 'd been given a hard-on by a dog ! " Shit ! " He sat upright , dug his palms into his eyes to try to clear his brain , and snuck a wary peek at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank God . Steve drew a relieved breath , then glanced over at the woman who was stretched out in all her naked splendor against the deep glossy green of their kudzu bed . The least she could do was lie on her stomach , he thought resentfully as his member , under no illusions this time , rose to instant atten-tion . Given a taste of what it craved , the damned thing was proving insa-tiable . But she did look good . Summer . The name suited her a lot better than Rosencrans , which was why he 'd better stick to calling her Rosencrans . Her eyes were closed . Her lashes lay in beautiful semicircular sweeps against her cheeks . Dozing , she looked flushed and satiated and content , just exactly like a woman was supposed to look in the aftermath of passion . Clearly she had forgotten , temporarily , that they were on the run for their lives . For all the anxiety she exhibited , she could have been lying on the smoothest sheets , the thickest mattress , at the best hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great stress reliever . He had discovered that for himself long ago . It was also an excellent stress inducer , at least in this particular case . The longer he looked at the object of his desire , the more stress he felt . The obvious answer , of course , was simply not to look at her . But he could n't quite do that . Naked , she was beautiful . One arm curved up and around to pillow her head . Her armpit was exposed , white and vulnerable . The urge to crawl over to her and press his mouth to that enticing area was almost irresistible , but from somewhere he found the strength to resist . Her dark brown hair fanned out over her bent arm to form a kind of a halo around her face . Her nose was straight , the nostrils slightly dilated as she breathed . Her lips  --  wide , tender lips that knew how to kiss  --  were parted . He wanted to press his mouth there , too , but again he managed to keep himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt guilty as he acknowledged them . Each one , directly or indirectly , could be attributed to him . The discolorations emphasized rather than detracted from the sheer allure of her milky skin . Milky skin that had felt like warm silk under his hands . With the best will in the world not to do so , Steve mentally stroked that skin with his gaze . Now that his vision was back to normal , he could appreciate properly her full womanly shape . Voluptuous was the only word that did justice to the jutting fullness of her breasts and the roundness of her hips , to the curve of her belly and waist and the long , delectable length of her legs . She had small feet . He was a sucker for small feet . Just looking at her made him so hard that he had to grit his teeth to keep from doing anything about it . What made it worse was the knowledge that she was his for the taking . He could do anything he liked with her . She had told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and snatched up his briefs . " Steve ? " His nemesis sat up , blinking the sleep from her eyes , still as naked as a babe but a hell of a lot more enticing to look at . She made not the slightest attempt to cover herself as she watched him yank his briefs up his legs , followed by his shorts . Even though he WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 177  | determinedly refused to look in her direction , just the memory of her rosy nipples and mink-brown bush and all the hills and valleys between drove him mad . " Get dressed , " he said harshly . He should never have brought a woman along . But what choice had he had ? None . The knowledge did n't help . Gathering up her clothes in a quick grab , he tossed them at her . " Is something wrong ? " She sounded hesitant , confused . Her voice was a throaty , sexy contralto  --  why had n't he ever before noticed just how sexy it was ? ? and it immediately conjured up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could dicks break ? Because his felt as if it were going to , crammed inside the too tight shorts as it was . Keeping his back to her , he pulled at his fly in a vain attempt to relieve the pressure , and reached for his shirt . " We 've got to get moving . " He knew he sounded hostile , but he could n't help it . He felt hostile . The whole damned situation was impossible . Here he was , facing the distinct possibility of a woefully shortened life span , saddled with a chatterbox woman and her sissy mutt , with what felt like the whole damned population of the bad-guy hall of fame after him and a ghostly vision tormenting him at every turn , and all he wanted to do was get his rocks off  --  again . And again . And again . With her . With Summer . Damn it to hell . What a hell of a situation . " So you 're one of those , " that sexy voice said with cold disdain . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , pulling on his shoes . " One of those wham , bam , **33;0;TOOLONG types . " " What ? " That did it . He had to glance around at her . She had one knee raised , the other curled beside her , and looked about as sexy as any woman he had ever seen as she sat naked among the dark green leaves and purple flowers and gray-barked trees of their bower , looking down her nose at him . " I should have guessed , " she said witheringly , and stood up , walking past him with regal dignity . His breathing suspended as desire grabbed him by the balls . His eyes were riveted on her backside as she walked , naked , through the forest , her lush ass swaying , her spine straight , her hair flowing around her shoulders . 178 KAREN ROBARDS  | God , what an ass ! Shades of Lady Godiva ! " Where are you going ? " he asked , feeling as if he might strangle on the very act of speaking . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or have n't you noticed ? " He had definitely noticed . He had to reach inside his own shorts for a quick adjustment before he was bent double with pain . Gathering up her shoes , socks , clothes , and dog , he followed . By the time he reached her side , she had extracted her bra and panties from the gym bag he had dropped , and donned them . The garments were plain white , sturdy and sensible rather than seductive . The bra had a knot in one strap . So why did they turn him on ? Hell , everything about her turned him on . If he was n't careful , he was going to catch himself getting excited over her damned sissified dog . The animal licked his wrist . Alarmed , he put her down . " Now that we 've got that out of our systems , maybe we can put our heads together and figure some way out of this . " Her gaze , meeting his as he straightened , was a cool challenge . She stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pulled them up her legs , adjusted them around her waist , and then , to Steve 's mingled relief and regret , pulled the black T-shirt over her head . She filled out that T-shirt so well that even the bull terrier adorning it seemed to be panting with lust . She might have that out of her system , but he did n't . In fact , he had the distinct feeling that the poison was spreading . " Yeah . Right . " His reply was lame . He recognized that himself , but he could n't help it . He could hardly think , much less talk . With a curl of her lip , she reached over and took her shoes and socks from his hand and dropped them to the ground . Then , picking up the gym bag , she heaved it at his midsection . " Catch ! " " Whoa ! " Steve caught the bag with a grunt . She had thrown it hard . Eyeing her narrowly as she sank to the ground to pull on her shoes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had not thrown the tire iron at him instead . Milady was clearly p.o. ' d . " You have thought beyond what happens once we get to your fishing camp , have n't you ? " she asked scathingly , wrapping long shoelaces WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 179  | around her ankles and tying them . " Going up there to think is n't much of a plan . If you do n't mind my saying so . " Wait a minute . Unless she could come up with something better , he did mind her saying so . Steve was just about to tell her that when she stood up , scooped up her ridiculous beribboned mutt , and strode off . Leaving him to gather up the gear , snatch up his cap and settle it on his head , and follow . He did n't much like following , he discovered . It was n't his style . Especially when the leader he was following had a mouthwatering tush that gave him a pang with its every come-hither swing .  | What did you mean , wham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blue . He sat on the ground , his back propped against a tree , one leg stretched out before him , the other raised and bent at the knee . The damned symbolic Bulls cap was pulled low over his eyes . They had stopped to eat  --  peanut butter crackers and water , and a raw hot dog for Muffy  --  beside the clear green water of a rippling creek . It must have been late afternoon ? Summer had lost all track of time , so she could n't be sure , but it felt like late afternoon . Sun slanted down through the trees , dappling the ground and the rock on which she sat . The day had been hot , maybe ninety degrees , but the forest had protected them from the worst of the heat . They got humidity and gnats instead . The combination , in her opinion , was worse . Sweat beaded Summer 's forehead . Her hair , unwashed now for almost three whole days , felt rank . She did n't even like to think about whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratched the large red insect bite on her calf absentmindedly . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " Still furious at herself for almost tumbling headlong into another disastrous relationship with another disastrous man , Summer replied coldly . It was n't only herself she was furious at , either . Every time she thought about how uninhibited she had been with him , the things she had said and done and felt , WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 181  | she wanted to cringe . Even more humiliatingly , when she remembered the things he had done to her with his hands and mouth and body , she could n't help it : She felt a little thrill . That thrill made her mad all over again . Then , while she had still been basking in the glow of the most fantastic lovemaking session she had ever experienced , he had made it clear that it had meant absolutely nothing to him . She meant absolutely nothing to him . He 'd been horny , and he 'd wanted sex . That was the simple truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost all interest in her . He had n't even had the good manners or good sense  --  to pretend other-wise . She did n't know why she had been surprised . " What you said  --  back there . You said I was another one of those wham , barn , **25;35;TOOLONG types . " His voice was carefully neutral . Good thing . It would n't have taken much to make her fly at him like an enraged blue jay . Summer stopped chewing and swallowed . " Oh , God , you 're not one of those men who has to rehash things every time you have sex , are you ? What do you want , applause ? " She was pardonably pleased when his eyes narrowed . " I just want to know what you meant . " " Not a thing . " She drank water from her well-rinsed beer can . Under the circumstances , the taste of beer would have been the last straw . She would have been violently ill . " Forget it . " " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part bulldog ? Ca n't you just let it drop ? " Apparently not put off by the edge in her voice , Frankenstein shook his head . " Nope . " Summer scowled at him . " All right . If you really want to know , I 'll tell you . My ex-husband was like that . He wanted sex when he wanted it , and he would sulk for days if I did n't instantly oblige . I learned that it was easier just to do it , you know , rather than put up with his pouting . So we 'd have sex  --  it usually took about five minutes  --  and as soon as it was over he 'd jump out of bed , run for the shower , and get on with his life . Wham , barn , **33;62;TOOLONG , see ? And that would be the last I 'd get of any kind of love or romance or even simple human kindness out of him until he got horny again . At which time the whole process would be repeated . Know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd drink a beer . The only 182 KAREN ROBARDS  | time he ever did . " Summer looked down at the can in her hand , and grimaced . " I hate the taste of beer . " " I 'm not your ex-husband . " " No , you 're not , are you ? " Summer smiled at him , but it was n't a nice smile . She was n't feeling particularly nice at that precise moment . " So I do n't have to put up with that kind of crap from you , do I ? And I wo n't . " She took another sip of water , and said what she had been thinking for the last few miles . " I 've decided to call Sammy . " " What ? " Frankenstein almost choked on his own water . " You heard me . I 've decided to call Sammy . I do n't know how you think you 're going to get out of this mess alive , and to tell you the truth I do n't particularly care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom I am still very fond , who also happens to be the Murfreesboro Chief of Police , to come and get me . You may not trust him , but I do . " Frankenstein stared at her . Summer ate her last cracker with elaborate unconcern . Over the past few hours her thinking had grown crystal clear . Further involvement with Steve Calhoun and his problems was a recipe for disaster on all fronts . He could break her heart . He could get her killed . It had taken her a while to develop wisdom , but , by golly , she had at last developed it . One thing she had learned over the course of her life was that she had to take care of herself ; nobody else would . Certainly not Frankenstein . " You ca n't do that . " " Oh yes I can . Try to stop me . " " It could very well be suicide . " " So could staying with you . I prefer to take my chances with Sammy . " Frankenstein gulped some more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cards . " " What do you mean , it 's not in the cards ? It 's in the cards if I want it to be in the cards . You do n't tell me what to do . " " Somebody needs to . You 're about as good at taking care of yourself as that ridiculous dog . " " Oh , yeah ? I hate to point this out to you , but both Muffy and I seem to be better at taking care of ourselves than you are at taking care of yourself . We did n't get ourselves into this mess : you did . The whole world 's chasing us because of you . You 're the problem here , and I 've decided that in order to fix the problem , Muffy and I need to get away from you . " WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 183  | " Wait a minute . This is all because you 're mad at me about what happened this morning , is n't it ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad because we had sex . " " I am not ! " " You are too . " Summer took a deep breath . " I am not mad at you because we had sex . " No , you 're mad because we had sex and you enjoyed it . " Summer felt her cheeks heat . " Pretty full of yourself , are n't you , Frankenstein ? What makes you so sure I enjoyed it ? " " I know when a woman has a good time during sex . " " Oh , yeah ? Well , you had a good time too . " " Yes , I did . " He met her fuming gaze full on . " I had a fantastic time . You were great . Is that what you want to hear ? Is everything all better now ? " " I do n't want to hear anything at all from you . " Summer poured the rest of her water onto the ground and stood up . " I do n't know what you 're so bent out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you recall . You wanted it , you got it . So why do n't you quit acting like an outraged virgin ? " " I did not come on to you ! " " Oh , yeah ? Kiss me , Steve . What was that ? Touch me here . Sounds like coming on to me to me . " " Maybe I was just trying to distract you from the little ghost you 're so afraid of . Did you ever think of that ? Was that the problem at the end , by the way ? Did you think you were seeing Deedee again ? " Summer said that last in a mocking falsetto  --  and she struck home . She could tell it by the clenching of his jaw , and the sense that , if humans could give off steam , he would be . They glared at each other . Muffy , watching , burrowed her nose beneath her paws . Neither of the human combatants payed her the least bit of attention . " Fine , " Frankenstein said suddenly , his jaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , it 's fine with me . Call your father-in-law . Maybe the time he and his buddies take to try to make you talk will give me just the extra hour or so I need to get away . Maybe I 'll get really lucky , and they 'll make sushi out of the mutt , too . " " You leave Muffy out of this ! " " With pleasure . " He got to his feet , cramming the remains of their 184 KAREN ROBARDS  | lunch into the gym bag . " Come on , Rosencrans . You want to take your chances with the law , I 'll help you find a phone . " Good . That was just what she wanted . A phone . " There 's a campground about five miles south of here , " Frankenstein continued , shouldering the gym bag and tucking the tire iron under his arm . " Or at least there used to be . Come on , baby , let 's take you to Papa . It 'll be a relief to get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was left to pick up Muffy and follow . If she had n't been so darned mad , by the time they reached the outskirts of the campground she would have had second thoughts about the advisability of what she meant to do . His crack about making sushi out of her and Muffy had hit home . She kept remembering Linda Miller and Betty Kern . But she could n't back down now . She was too darn mad at him . Anyway , despite anything Frankenstein said to the contrary , she was making the only sane decision . She was ( almost ) sure of it . Sammy loved her like the daughter he had never had . He would never hurt her . She was as certain of that as it was possible to be certain of anything . The sound of children laughing was Summer 's first clue that they had reached their destination . Hearing it , Frankenstein stopped walking and propped a shoulder against a tree , waiting for her to catch up . " This is it , " he said laconically as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We used to camp here sometimes when I was a kid . Go to the manager 's office  --  it 's in the middle of the campground . I 'm sure you can talk somebody there into letting you use the phone . I 'd loan you a quarter , but I 'm fresh out . " He seemed to be in a hurry for her to leave him . Looking ahead at what seemed to be a play area still some distance away through the trees , Summer hesitated . Should she do this ? " Getting cold feet ? " he asked . Or maybe sneered was a better word . " You can come with me , " she said . Angry as she was with him , she hated to think of him being left out in the woods all alone , with murderers on his trail . " Sammy 's not part of this . I know it in my bones . " " Believe me , Rosencrans , your bones have got no intuitive powers . They 're good for jumping and not much else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straw . Summer straightened her spine , WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 185  | lifted her chin , and started to walk away without so much as a good-bye . " Rosencrans ! " Summer glanced back . Having unzipped the gym bag , Frankenstein held her wadded-up uniform in one hand . As she looked at him , he heaved the garments at her . She almost dropped Muffy as she grabbed for the clothes . Catching them clumsily , she stuffed the ball he had made of them under one arm . Aping Frankenstein , she had Muffy clamped under the other one . " Sure you do n't want to change your mind ? " he asked as their eyes met for a brief moment . Summer shook her head . " Sure you do n't want to change yours ? " Frankenstein shook his head , then lifted a hand in a salute . Summer ignored niggling second , third , and fourth thoughts , turned her back on him , and started walking away . She was doing the right thing . She knew it , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " She looked back at him again . " You 've got great tits and a great ass . If we both get out of this in one piece I might just give you a call . " Before she could reply , he turned and strode off through the trees . Summer found herself well and truly alone . Suddenly every tiny noise was magnified : the hum of the cicadas , the harsh squawk of an angry blue jay , the excited laughter of the distant children . The forest seemed suddenly bigger , darker , more menacing . Muffy whimpered . Summer bent her head to rub her nose against the dog 's fur . At least she was n't quite alone . The knowledge did n't make her feel appreciatively better . She was conscious of an enormous sense of loss . For a moment she almost feared she might cry . She , who never cried . Summer clamped her teeth together so her lips would not tremble . She was better off without Steve Calhoun . Leaving him behind was the first step to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life . Clinging to that thought , Summer walked through the trees past the playground where children played on ancient swings and more children rode plastic animals on springs cemented to the ground and still more children swarmed over a decrepit-looking jungle gym . 186 KAREN ROBARDS WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 187  | They , and their tired-looking parents , paid her no mind at all . She kept walking , past pickup campers and RVs and tents . People went about their business , none of them paying the least attention to her . In front of one tent , a couple and their sulky-looking teenage son sat in molded plastic chairs . The couple argued while the boy snapped his fingers in time to the music that apparently poured through the headphones that he wore . " Excuse me , could you point me toward the manager 's office ? " Summer asked the woman , who broke off her argument with her husband to stare suspiciously at Summer as she approached . " Up that way , " she said , jerking her thumb in the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta warn ya : This campground do n't allow no dogs . " " Thank you . " Summer beat a hasty retreat . Something about the way the woman looked at her made her uneasy . Again she got the feeling that maybe , just maybe , she had made a mistake . Maybe she should have stuck with Frankenstein after all . She had made the right choice , Summer reassured herself stoutly as she headed down the gravel road toward , she hoped , the manager 's office . One phone call to Sammy and her troubles would be over . He would come and fetch her and take her somewhere safe and feed her and provide her with a bed and a bathtub and .. . Showers . She was walking past public showers . Summer 's head swiveled as that fact hit home . The sign on the concrete-block building 's blue-painted door was unmistakable : WOMEN 'S SHOWERS . Before she saw Sammy , before she bearded the manager in his den and begged for the use of his phone , she could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had probably been staring at her so strangely because she looked like a close cousin of the Creature from the Black Lagoon . Not for long . Unable to resist the lure of hot water , Summer headed for the showers . Inside , the building was deserted , probably because early evening was an awkward time for showering for most normal folks . The concrete walls were painted white , and the tile floor was an off-shade of blue . If the grout was moldy and mildew adorned the corners , why , to Summer 's mind it did n't detract one iota from the sheer beauty of her surroundings . Dented blue lockers , grayish white shower curtains , and  | a mirror with a crack running across its upper right corner looked to her deprived eyes like fixtures that would have been right at home in Buckingham Palace . So what if it smelled damp and musty ? She was actually in a real live bathroom ! Muffy wriggled , and Summer put her down . Muffy sniffed the air suspiciously , then pressed close against Summer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she went into a toilet stall , made use of the facilities  --  real toilet paper was such a luxury that she almost kissed the roll  --  and then searched the eight shower cubicles for soap . In the fourth one , she got lucky . Not only was there a sweet-smelling white rectangle left behind in the soap dish , there was an entire makeup kit in a clear plastic zippered case on the flimsy white shampoo shelf that dangled from the showerhead . Manna from heaven ! Summer thrust her wadded up Daisy Fresh uniform onto a bench outside the shower cubicle . As she did so , a clatter attracted her attention . Glancing down , she saw that a cigarette lighter lay on the floor beneath her clothes . The cigarette lighter . The yellow Bic that had seen her and Frankenstein through their adventures . Thrown carelessly into the gym bag , it must have gotten caught up in her clothes . How would Frankenstein start a fire tonight without that cigarette lighter ? She would not worry about him , Summer told herself stoutly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the time being . Maybe Sammy could fix things for him , too . He had been eager enough to have her leave him . But she was n't going to think about Frankenstein . Not now . Now she was going to have a shower and maybe put on some makeup , and then , when she was clean and human-looking again , call Sammy . Sammy could sort this whole mess out . If anyone could save Frankenstein , it was Sammy . She picked up the cigarette lighter , tried not to trip over Muffy as the dog followed her into the shower , and unzipped the makeup kit . The cosmetics it contained were drugstore brands , inexpensive but adequate : a pot of Cherry Smackers lip gloss , a tube of mascara , pur-ple  --  purple ? ? eye shadow , powder blush in a namby-pamby shade of pink , and a pressed-powder compact , luckily translucent . She had a feeling that the makeup kit belonged to a teenage blonde . But it was hers now . Finders keepers. 188 KAREN ROBARDS  | There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair spray . Who could ask for anything more ? Adding the lighter to the bag 's contents and zipping it closed again , Summer turned on the hot water and blissed out . Half an hour later , she stood fully dressed in front of the cracked mirror . She had washed her hair as well as her body with the sweetsmelling soap , and then brushed the damp strands around her fingers until the ends gave up and curled . After fixing the reluctant curve with a spritz of hair spray , she turned her attention to her face . The bruise on her forehead was turning yellowish  --  which just brought out the gold glints in her eyes , she consoled herself as she flicked mascara onto her lashes . A dab of powder on her nose  --  not for anything would she use that appalling pink blush , and , anyway , after two days spent outdoors without sunblock she certainly did n't need the color ? and she was almost done . As a final touch , she applied gloss to her appreciative lips . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fled the shower at the first hint of spray but who once again hugged her ankles , yapped once . Summer glanced down at her . Her tail was erect , and her ears were , too . Turned the opposite way around from Summer , she faced the door . Glancing up , Summer was just in time to watch through the mirror as Charlie , the thug from her basement , stepped through the shower room 's door . He was still wearing the same ornate western belt .  | Moving slowly , almost of their own volition as her mind all but ceased to function , Summer 's hands fumbled among the cosmetics spread out on the sink . Lip gloss , powder compact , mascara , hair spray .. . Charlie met her gaze through the mirror . He smiled , revealing yellowing teeth . Muffy growled . Suddenly weak-kneed , Summer resisted the almost overwhelming urge to whirl to face him . Her stomach pressed hard into the edge of the sink . Her hands continued their frantic search . " Remember me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she told herself fiercely . I must remain calm . " Of course you do , " Charlie answered for her , and chuckled . " Where 's Calhoun ? " He ambled toward her , his eyes watchfully scanning the room . It must have been obvious after just a few seconds that Summer was alone , and as he relaxed a swagger entered his gait . So confident was he that he had her trapped , he did n't even bother to make a point of displaying the wicked-looking switchblade that he grasped in one hand . " I do n't know . " Her voice was reedy with panic . Her heart 190 KAREN ROBARDS  | pounded . Her lips parted as she fought for breath . Terror , raw and numbing , threatened to overcome her senses . Stay calm , she cautioned herself again . " Sure you do n't . " " I do n't . We  --  split up a while back . " Charlie shrugged . " You do n't want to tell me now , that 's cool . You 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fun that way . At least , it is for me . You might not think so . " His gaze met hers through the mirror . He smiled again . " Hey , you sure clean up nice . Mind , I thought you were real pretty even down in your basement . " Oh , God , his eyes were crawling all over her body through the mirror . Summer felt unclean . Was rape as well as torture and murder on his agenda ? Whatever happened , she would not go quietly into that good night . She would fight . She did n't know if she had the strength to fight . Fear rendered her muscles as flaccid as spaghetti . Why , oh why , had she ever left Frank-enstein ? Charlie covered the twenty or so feet separating them in what seemed to Summer like the blink of an eye . And yet , he did n't appear to hurry at all . Now that he was close behind her , his paunchy belly almost touching her back , she grew light-headed with fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill her where she stood . He needed her to find the van  --  and Steve . That knowledge pumped a modicum of courage into her veins . Her fingers wrapped tightly around the items she had sought and found . " It 's gon na be my pleasure getting you to tell me everything you know . " His hand , warm and stubby-fingered , closed over the back of her neck . A spasm of revulsion shivered along Summer 's spine . Charlie glanced down at the floor suddenly , his expression ugly . " Oh , no you do n't , " he said , and before Summer realized who , or what , he was talking to , he drew back his foot and kicked something viciously . " You wo n't piss on my foot . " The brown fur mop that was Muffy flew through the air , crashing with a piteous yelp into the tile beneath the sink . The distraction provided Summer with the opening she needed . Jerking free of Charlie 's hold , she threw herself to the left  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scuttled for safety uttering high-pitched yelps . Summer fell heavily , landing on her elbow and hip . For a moment the pain of hitting her crazy bone against the tile floor almost paralyzed her . She barely managed to hang on to the items in her hands as electrifying tingles shot up and down her arm . Flopping like a fish , she turned onto her back . " So you want to play , bitch ? " Charlie was coming toward her , an ugly smile on his face . He loomed over her , swooping down . " I 'll play . " He waved the knife inches above her face . He leered at her , his face ugly , menacing . Long hairs grew out of his nostrils , and he had a scar on his chin . Gathering all her courage , ignoring the lessening tingles in her arm , Summer raised her clenched fists and brought them together over her chest . The Bic lighter was in her right hand . Summer flicked it , and a tiny flame shot up . Almost simultaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nozzle belonged to the pink metal cylinder of the purse-size hair spray . The sickly sweet scent of hair spray reached Summer 's nostrils milliseconds before the stream of aerosol mist hit the flame . " What the . . . ? " Charlie began . With a muted roar , a tongue of fire shot two feet in the air . Charlie , leaning down , was caught full in the face . He screamed , dropping the knife and staggering backward , hands clutching his face , as the smell of burning filled the air . Summer released the nozzle , watching with horrified fascination . What she could see of his face behind his hands was bright red . Tiny flames licked at the edges of his hair . Summer did n't wait to see more . Still clutching her homemade flamethrower , she scrambled for the door on all fours . Muffy was ahead of her , then underneath her , running too . Summer got tangled up by the little dog , and almost fell flat on her face . " You bitch ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sobbing , face uncovered now , Charlie lurched after her , arms opening and closing like giant pincers as he grabbed for her . Apparently his vision had been affected ; it was obvious he could not see clearly . Staggering in her wake , he looked like an apparition from hell . Charred skin hung in long strips from his face . The surface that remained was pulpy and raw . His eyebrows and lashes were gone . The flames that had danced 192 KAREN ROBARDS  | along his hairline were now extinguished , leaving little wisps of smoke in their place . Dodging his clutching arms , Summer fought to bite back a scream . Screaming could do her no good . It would only alert Charlie 's pals , who , she was sure , lurked somewhere in the vicinity . " I 'm gon na kill you ! " It was an unearthly howl . Summer 's hair stood on end . She reached the door and climbed it , scrabbling for the knob . He seemed to really see her then . His eyes focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knob . She yanked opened the door just as he lunged for her , and bolted  --  smack into a solid masculine chest . For an instant after the collision she was shocked speechless . Hard male hands grasped her shoulders , hurting her as they held her captive . Hysterical tears rose to her eyes , making her vision swim . Despair rendered her both blind and numb . She could see nothing , feel noth-ing . That she had almost escaped made her recapture seem even more cruel . " Bitch ! " The howling thing that was Charlie came charging through the door . With a push her captor shoved her aside . Summer fell to the ground , scraping her knees on the gravel path that circled the building but not caring as she clawed at the grass to get away . God was affording her one more chance at freedom , it seemed , and it was not for her to question the whys and wherefores of his gift . Summer staggered to her feet , glancing fearfully over her shoulder as she prepared to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tire iron down on Charlie 's head with all his might . She would recognize that Bulls cap anywhere . Thwack ! Charlie dropped like a felled tree . He toppled backward , his head striking the metal door with a resounding thud on the way down , and lay still . " Take that , you bastard , " Frankenstein said , standing over him . " Steve , oh , Steve ! " Summer had never been so glad to see anyone in her life . She stumbled toward him , collapsing against his chest . His arms , including the one that still held the tire iron , closed around her . He hugged her tight . Summer felt something that might have been his lips brush the top of her head . " Oh , Steve ! " " Are you all right ? " He held her a little away from him , looking intently down into her face . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 193  | Summer took a deep breath , nodded , and collapsed into his arms again . " What happened to him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at Charlie 's ruined face . " I  --  I did it . " Her teeth chattered with shock . " You did it ? Jesus , what did you do ? " It was only then that Summer realized she still clutched the lighter and hair spray . " I  --  I ? this , " she stuttered , holding out her hands so that he could see the evidence . " You lit his cigarette or styled his hair ? " he asked dryly , relieving her of her weapons . He turned them over in his hands , studying them . " I burned him . " " You burned him ? " " If you spray the hair spray over the flame , it makes a kind of flamethrower . I saw it on F/X2 . " " F/X2 ? " He sounded totally at sea . " It 's a movie . " She was shaking . His arms came around her once more , holding her close against his comforting warmth . " Jesus . " He glanced down at Charlie again , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rosencrans , you are something else . " A whimper came from the other side of the closed door . " Muffy ! " Summer would recognize that sound anywhere . Steve bent to shove the hair spray and lighter into the gym bag at his feet , then obligingly pushed the door open . The little dog , now limping on her hind leg , came out , skirting Charlie 's inanimate body to crowd against Summer 's ankles . " He kicked her , " Summer said , picking Muffy up . " Oh , yeah ? " Steve glanced down as Charlie stirred and groaned , and started to sit up . " That 's for Muffy , " he said grimly , bringing the tire iron down on Charlie 's head . Charlie fell back as if he had been poleaxed . He landed so hard that his head bounced ; then Steve hit him again , across the chest . Summer winced instinctively at the sound of the blow . " And that 's for Summer . " " Stop ! " Summer could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He was trying to kill us , remember ? " Steve said . " Anyway , I never kill people in cold blood . I just aim to put him out of commission for a while . " Steve was hefting the tire iron skyward for what Summer suspected might be another blow just as a blond teenager in skintight jeans and 194 KAREN ROBARDS  |p194an  older , heavyset woman in Lycra bicycle shorts and an oversize pink T-shirt came around the corner of the building . " I must have left it in here . . . " the girl was saying , only to break off as she saw Steve and Summer staring at her with Charlie sprawled at their feet . The woman saw them at the same time and clutched the girl 's arm , stopping her in her tracks . Both their eyes went wide as saucers , and their mouths gaped , as they stared . " We were just leaving , " Steve said hastily , snatching the gym bag from the ground near his feet and pulling Summer with him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willingly . The girl and her mother began to back away , then turned and ran in the direction from which they had come . In the distance Summer heard sirens wail . She glanced over her shoulder in the direction of the sound . A navy Lincoln Continental nosed into view , moving slowly toward them down the gravel road that bisected the campground . A navy Lincoln Continental . . . She knew that car ! " It 's them , " Summer said urgently , but Steve had already seen . He grabbed Muffy from her , tucked her under his arm , caught Summer 's hand , and pulled her around the corner of the shower building out of sight of the car . Then he ran . Her fingers entwined with his , Summer ran too , as if all the demons of hell were after her . Which , in a manner of speaking , they were . Even as they left the campground behind , the sirens grew louder . They ran through the trees , leaping small bushes and fallen logs , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Keeping up with Frankenstein in full flight was hard , but terror gave Summer 's feet wings , and her lungs strength . Besides , she was deathly afraid to let go of his hand . Not for anything did she mean to get left behind . At last they paused for breath on top of what Summer had thought was a small rise , both of them bending almost double as they gasped for air . Muffy , set on her feet , immediately collapsed with a groan , and lay panting as though she had run every step of the way , which she emphatically had not . Glancing around , Summer was surprised to discover that the small rise was in actuality a stone-faced cliff , and they were perched near the edge of it , overlooking the campground below , spread out like a child 's playscape . She was even more surprised to see the blue lights of at least half a dozen police cars , minuscule at that distance , flashing in front of a squat building that she took to be the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never even called Sammy , " she said , puzzled . Had all those cops shown up because the girl and the woman from in front of the showers had reported a beating ? But that was impossible . She had first heard the sirens while the women were still in sight . " You did n't need to . " Steve reached into his back pocket and drew something out , which as he unfolded it Summer recognized as the front page of the morning newspaper . " Look at this . " He handed it to her . Summer looked and gasped . There , in full color on the front page , staring back at her , were three remarkably clear photographs : Steve , herself , and Muffy , whom the caption grandly identified as Grand Champion Margie 's Miss Muffet . The headline over the pictures , set in inch-high boldface type , read : CALHOUN , GIRLFRIEND , DOG SOUGHT IN CONNECTION WITH DOUBLE HOMICIDE . Jaw dropping , Summer scanned the accompanying story . She , Muffy , and Steve were the subjects of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty Kern had been found in her home . The police were working with two possibilities : Either she and Steve , whose fingerprints had been found at the scene , were partners in crime , or he had taken her , and her dog , hostage . In any case , citizens spotting any of the three were asked not to try to apprehend them but to call police . They were considered armed and extremely dangerous . " Where did you get this ? " Summer asked , dumbfounded . " In the manager 's office . I decided you were making a mistake , so I came looking for you . You were n't where I expected you to be , but the manager was . So was this . He was reading it when I came through the door . I had to take him out . " " Oh , my God ! You did n't . . . ? " She glanced at him , her thoughts immediately turning to murder . " No , I did n't , " he said dryly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold blood . I just put him to sleep for a while . He never had a chance to tell anybody , and nobody else saw me . I made damned sure of that . Somebody must have recognized you or the dog  --  I told you , she 's so weirdlooking she attracts attention  --  and called the police . " " I asked a woman the way to the manager 's office , " Summer said , remembering . " The way she looked at me  --  it must have been her ! " " Probably . " He was looking down at the scene below . People , at that distance appearing no bigger than ants , were beginning to crowd around the police cars . 196 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Maybe we should go back , " Summer said hesitantly , looking too . " After all , they are the police ... " He shook his head . Summer did n't argue . As far as she was concerned , her safety now lay with Steve .  | They were still standing there , watching the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up slowly to park beside the police cars . A man got out and was almost immediately joined by two uniformed police officers . The man and the officers walked around to the back of the truck , scattering the gathered crowd . The man climbed up into the truckbed , did something , then jumped down again . This time he was accompanied by a pack of leashed dogs . Summer could hear shrill echoes of their cries from where she stood . Muffy came upright , her head cocking as she stared down . " Jesus . They 've brought in dogs . " A third cop walked up to the group around the animals , and passed a bundle of what looked like cloth to their handler . The man took the bundle , bent and offered it for the dogs to sniff . " Did you leave anything in the shower room ? " Steve was folding the newspaper back into its small rectangle . Summer thought . " The  --  the makeup kit . Uh  --  and my uniform ! My Daisy Fresh uniform ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I 'd say so , " Steve answered grimly , and returned the folded newspaper to his back pocket . Even as Summer looked down again , the handler loosed the dogs . 198 KAREN ROBARDS  | There were five brown and black hounds , and they scattered , sniffing the ground . Seconds later one of them , near the building , set up a howl . " He 's found the trail . " The other dogs rallied to their leader , and all five of them streaked in a pack for the woods , baying at the top of their lungs . " Oh , God , what do we do ? Do you have a plan ? " Summer looked wildly at Steve . " Yeah , " he answered , bending to scoop up Muffy and then grabbing the gym bag and Summer 's hand . " Run like hell . " Some plan . But Summer did n't say it . She did n't have a chance . With Steve dragging her along behind him , it was a struggle to breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a distant , but potent , spur . Her feet barely touched the ground , she ran so fast . She almost seemed to be floating  --  probably because she felt light-headed . Summer did n't know whether that was from the altitude , hunger , or fear . They ran down a gulley full of brush , which sported a trickle of water at its bottom . Halfway down the mountain , the gulley suddenly made a sharp left , and turned into a full-blown creek . Steve splashed into the icy water , yanking Summer after him . She slipped on the smooth brown stones that covered the creekbed , and went down on one knee , disturbing a school of minnows , which scat-tered . " Ouch ! " A rock jabbed into Summer 's knee , but she had no time to suffer properly . Steve was already hauling her upright . " Why do we have to run through a creek ? " Summer wailed as she rubbed her damaged kneecap . The way it felt at that moment , she would never be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs ca n't track through water . " Steve paused for about two seconds , just long enough to glance down at her leg and ascertain that she was not seriously injured . " I do n't think . " " Oh , great . You do n't think . That 's reassuring . I hope you 're right . " Without bothering to reply , Steve jerked her into motion again . With the surefootedness of a goat , he bounded through the ankledeep water . Slip-sliding , cursing , and praying with every step , Summer splashed precariously after him . The sounds of the dogs grew fainter . Finally , about the time Summer 's lungs and heart threatened to burst , Steve clambered out of the creek and collapsed facedown on WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 199 the ivy-covered bank . Summer , falling on her stomach beside him , fought to breathe . Muffy , lying on her side like a creature exhausted when she had n't run so much as a step , even had the temerity to pant . Summer did n't have the strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catch your breath . We ca n't stop long , " Steve advised her , drawing in deep lungfuls of air . " Where are we going ? Are we still heading to your fishing camp ? " Steve shook his head . " That was Plan A , and it 's scrapped . If the police are going to scour these hills with dogs , they 'll find it in two shakes of a Iamb 's tail . Now we 're on to Plan B. " " What 's Plan B ? " Summer asked with deep misgiving . Exhausted as he was , Steve managed a brief grin . " I 'm working on it , okay ? Let 's go ! " Summer groaned , but he was inexorable . He was on his feet again , dragging her up with him , making her run even though her legs were still shaky from the last marathon . The sun was at their backs as they raced downward through the forest . It was just beginning to dip beneath the majestic purple peaks . At any other moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magenta and neon orange pinwheels swirling across the western third of the sky . Under the circumstances , she spared the dazzling beauty of the heavens only a cursory glance  --  and hoped . Could dogs continue to track in the dark ? Surely even dogs had to rest sometime . A dirt bike roared toward them from the east . It literally flew into sight , jumping over the top of a hill and skittering semi-sideways down the slippery mountainside . A lone man was aboard , a young-looking man in jeans and a leather jacket . Steve slowed , and Summer slowed with him . " What now ? " she gasped , ready by this time to see a bad guy behind every tree . Steve looked at her , grinned , and let go of her hand . " Plan B , " he said , and jogged toward the oncoming motorcycle . It skidded to a flourishing halt in front of him , and the driver climbed off . Summer watched warily as he propped the bike on its kickstand , turned off the engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . He even patted Muffy on the head . He knew Steve . He was friendly . How on earth . . . ? 200 KAREN ROBARDS  | Summer approached with caution . In her experience , if something seemed too good to be true , it usually was . And an ally arriving out of nowhere certainly seemed too good to be true . Steve was grinning as he turned to beckon her in . The man beside him was more sober-faced . He was about Steve 's age and height , but leaner . His complexion was swarthy , and his hair was as black as oil and straight . Summer realized that he was Native American . " This is Renfro . Renfro , Summer . Here , put this on . " Renfro nodded at Summer as Steve passed her a bright yellow helmet that he unstrapped from the rear of the bike , then turned worried eyes on Steve . " Leave the dog with me . " Steve , putting on the helmet that Renfro had worn , shook his head . " Nah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogs besides chasing us . They catch you with the dog , they 'll know you helped us . That would n't be good for your health . " " I 'm not worried . " Renfro was strapping the gym bag and tire iron on the back of the bike . " Thanks anyway , buddy . And thanks for coming . I owe you . " " Big time . " Renfro smiled then , flashing even white teeth as he finished his self-appointed task . " As usual . " Steve laughed . " How will you get back ? " Renfro shrugged . " Walk . Thumb a ride . Catch a bus . Call my dad . I 'll manage . " " If you run into the posse hunting us . . . " " They wo n't bother me . I 'm hiking through the forest . What 's to bother ? If the dogs attack me , maybe I can sue . " He said it hopefully , with a wide grin . Summer realized that it was meant for a joke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Steve turned to look at her critically , tugging on the strap beneath her chin to make sure it was tight . His helmet was in place . She almost missed the Bulls cap , which he had tucked into the gym bag . " Oh , I almost forgot . " Renfro dug in the pocket of his jeans and brought forth some folded bills . " Forty dollars . It 's all I had in the shop . " " Thanks , man . " Steve accepted the money , stuffed it in his own back pocket . " Take care . " " You too . " Steve kicked up the stand , straddled the bike , and motioned for Summer to join him . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 201  | " What about Muffy ? " She looked down at the hairball at her feet . " You 'll have to hold her . Try to keep her out of sight . Maybe you can stick her under your shirt . " Summer picked up Muffy , lifted the hem of her T-shirt , and tucked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycle . It was about the size of an adult 's bicycle , but thicker . There were pegs for her feet , she discovered , and a metal bar against which she could rest her back . Perched on the narrow black vinyl seat , she felt about as secure as a cat on a high wire . Renfro grinned broadly , surveying them . " You look like the allAmerican family . Dad , Mom , baby-to-be " ? he patted the bulge in the tummy area of Summer 's T-shirt that was Muffy ? " on a Yamaha . Maybe they 'll use you in an ad . " " See ya , Renfro . " Steve kicked the starter . The bike roared . Renfro waved , and they were off . Summer had never experienced such a bone-rattling ride in her life . If she could have , Summer would have clung to Steve with all her strength as they careened over the uneven ground . But Muffy , who was not taking kindly to this new mode of transportation , was between them . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The other she clamped around Steve 's waist . They went up and then down the mountain , heading north rather than continuing in the easterly direction they had been traveling on foot . The bike skittered sideways on wet leaves and unseen rocks and roots so many times that Summer got used to feeling they were going to hit the dirt at any minute . Twice , when they came over a hill , she was treated to beautiful vistas of mountains rolling away into the distance , each crowned with its own halo of clouds . The scenery was straight out of a movie . The dangers were more real . Steep , heavily forested slopes ended without warning in craggy precipices . Sometimes the ground just seemed to stop , falling away in breathtaking drops of hundreds and even thousands of feet . So far , Steve had managed to avoid taking them over any of those drops . But Summer was n't optimistic . Lately , she 'd felt like a character on the old television show Hee Haw : If it were n't for bad luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear finally , Summer screwed up her eyes against the wind , held Muffy close , and hung on for dear life as they dodged trees and rocks and roots at speeds she was sure neared seventy miles an hour . 202 KAREN ROBARDS  | Early on , she realized there was nothing she could do to make her precarious perch any safer . Her life , and Muffy 's , were in Steve 's hands . She could only pray that he knew what he was doing  --  and that they would not zoom over a rise and find themselves sailing over a cliff . Surprise , surprise . Around them the world was growing darker . Lengthening shadows lay across the ground like prison bars . They crested another rise . The back tire came off the ground . In the distance , where Summer 's eyes fixed in sheer self-defense , mountains rose out of darkening air . Without warning the bike shot into the sky like a bucking bronco . This time , both wheels left the earth . Summer screeched , clamped both arms around Steve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Steve 's back , could n't have gotten free if she 'd wanted to ? and shut her eyes . When the bike landed , bouncing , they were on pavement , racing uphill . " You 're going to kill us ! " she screamed in Steve 's ear . " This is fun ! " he roared back . Fun . Of course , to him , it would be . I feel the need / the need for speed . . . He was suffering from Top Gun-itis again . " Is it even legal to ride this thing on the road ? " Summer yelled . " Hey , this baby swings both ways : on-road or off . " Whatever that meant . Summer decided not to worry about it . Men and their macho toys were beyond her understanding at the moment . It was a two-lane highway , and judging from the mist that crept across it , they were very high now in the mountains . Summer shivered , but not from fear , or the eeriness of her surroundings . Her shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was growing thoroughly chilled . But they seemed to have eluded their pursuers , at least temporarily . There were other vehicles on the road , a few cars , some campers . Vacationers all . No cops . No bad guys . With their helmets on , riding a motorcycle none of their pursuers knew they had , Summer thought-hoped  --  that she and Steve were to all intents and purposes invisible . Just two more tourists , vacationing in the mountains . " Where are we going ? " Summer screamed . The wind blew her question back in her face . " I do n't know . Maybe Mexico , " Steve yelled back . Mexico ? She did n't want to go to Mexico ! Anyway , they were heading north , not south ! WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 203  | She opened her mouth to tell him so , and promptly swallowed a bug . Gagging , spitting , she decided to hold her peace until they stopped . Surely they would stop soon . The constant vibration was making her butt numb . She shifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ridiculous , when one was running for one 's life , to worry about minor discomforts , Summer knew . But she could n't seem to help it : her butt was numb and her legs were cramped and her feet were going to sleep and she was freezing . The wind in her face never stopped . Cold and bug-laden , it beat against her skin , numbing that , too . And she was hungry . Starving , actually . As a diet , running for one 's life was proving drastic but effective . Maybe she could make an infomercial and market it and get rich . A green sign by the side of the road read APPALACHIAN TRAIL . Below it , a small brown woodchuck stood on its hind legs , sniffing the air . Ahead , as far as the eye could see , stretched miles of blue-green forest and dozens of mountain peaks , rising up out of the mist one after the other . The vista was beautiful , glorious  --  Summer realized that she was seeing the Smokies in all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of knowledge was , Yippee . As night descended , the traffic thinned out . Glancing behind her , Summer watched the twin white dots of car lights heading down the mountain . Except for an ancient blue camper just in front of them , they were alone on the mountaintop . Streaking through the dark , clinging like a monkey to a man she had n't even met three days before , Summer was assaulted by a sudden pang of homesickness . She missed her mother . She missed her sisters . She missed her nieces and nephews . She even missed her brothers-inlaw , with whom she did n't always see eye to eye . What she would n't give to be safe in her own house , warm and cozy and well fed , with all of this just a terrible nightmare from which she would soon awaken ! She was suddenly , searingly conscious of the man to whom she clung . Would she really wish Steve Calhoun to be nothing more than a figment of her dreams ? If she could , with a wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation he had gotten her into , would she ? The answer was disturbing : no . She might wish away the circumstances , but not the man . It occurred to her , in the near meditative state brought on by cold and wind and discomfort and unceasing vibration , to wonder why she 204 KAREN ROBARDS  | would n't wish away a man who had kidnapped her , terrorized her , brutalized her , and exposed her to numerous threats to life and limb , and who might still easily be the death of her . He was not her type at all . She was n't one hundred percent positive what her type was , but she was positive that he was n't it . He was n't even handsome , for goodness ' sake . Lem , with all his faults , was at least handsome . Steve Calhoun was rude and crude , liked violence and speed and danger , made jokes at her expense , admitted to a ( supposedly former ) drinking problem , and was hung up on a ghost . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the run for his life . He was , by no stretch of her imagination , her idea of what a Knight in Shining Armor should be . She had always , secretly , hankered after a Knight in Shining Armor . But he had come back for her , there at the campground . That was something . A very big something . She could n't be falling in love with him . Could she ? If she was , she was putting Heaven on notice right that minute that she would consider it just one more in a long line of life 's little dirty tricks . By the time night fell so conclusively that Summer was hard put to see her hand in front of her face , the camper had pulled off . Probably to make camp . At least , she assumed that was what campers did . She had never been camping in her life , and if this experience was any example of the pleasures of outdoor life , she did n't foresee taking it up anytime in the near future . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be said for physical misery as a means of taking one 's mind off one 's troubles , she would be the first to agree , but enough was enough . If they did n't stop soon so she could straighten her cramped muscles , Summer feared she might never walk again . Except for the beam of the motorcycle 's headlight cutting through the mist that now rolled across the road in great waves , there was no light at all . No moon . No stars . No streetlights . Complete darkness . Summer wondered about the cliffs that fell away from the roadside to her left , about the complete lack of guardrails , and about how high up they were . One wrong move and they would find themselves hurtling out into nothingness . She had a sudden ridiculous picture of herself , Steve , Muffy , and the motorcycle as E.T . and Co. , soaring into space to cycle in front of a full moon . There were just two things WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 205  | wrong with that vision , she thought : Number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and number two , the motorcycle could not fly . Instead they would crash and die ... . It was an effort , but the ache in all her muscles helped : Summer finally managed to dismiss that last cheering thought from her mind . Muffy whined , and Summer patted her consolingly . The little dog had actually settled down in her warm bed of tummy and T-shirt with surprising docility . Despite the pat , Muffy whined again , and Summer got the message : Muffy needed to go potty . She leaned forward to yell in Steve 's ear . " What ? " he yelled back . " Muffy has to pee ! " " So hold her out over the side ! " Funny . Very funny . " Will you stop ? " " As soon as I find a place . " They rode on for a bit . Muffy whined , Summer patted , the motorcycle rolled . Talking to Steve was at least something to do , even though hearing and being heard over the roar of the engine and rush of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you have any idea where we are ? " " I know exactly where we are . " " Well , where ? " " We 're lost ! " he yelled back , and laughed like a hyena . Summer would have punched him in the side if she had n't been afraid of those waiting cliffs .  | Why Steve finally decided to stop where he did , Summer could n't tell . He merely pulled off the road onto a pitchblack overlook just like every other pitch-black overlook they had passed . Far be it from her to question a gift from the gods , though , she thought , and climbed on shaking legs from the back of their metal steed while the climbing was good . She 'd ridden horseback a lot in her girlhood . The way she felt now was saddle-sore times ten . Muffy immediately squatted beside the motorcycle . Summer had to fight the urge to do the same . Instead , she staggered off into the dark . The wind blew unceasingly , growing colder with every minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains and trees and moonless sky , and shivered . For once , the cicadas were silent . Maybe they had crawled back into the ground for another seventeen years  --  or maybe they had frozen solid , as she felt she might do . But there were other living creatures in the forest . Summer could hear their rustlings . As she took care of business in the lee of a tree not fifteen feet from where Steve wrestled with the motorcycle , she had the sensation that a million unseen eyes were watching her through the dark . Probably thinking , Dinner ! WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 207  | Summer nearly broke her neck scrambling to rejoin Steve and ( relative ) safety . While she had been otherwise occupied , he had put the motorcycle up on its center stand and was , as she returned , unhitching the gym bag from the back . Muffy , her hair bow piteously askew , huddled at his feet . She 's as afraid of this place as I am , Summer thought , and , not without a few painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . Muffy rewarded her with a lick on the chin . " We may as well spend the night here . As dark as it is , it 's too dangerous to go on . " Hear , hear . But Summer did n't say it . Instead she followed Steve into the trees . " I have a question for you , " she said as , at Steve 's direction , she gathered sticks for a fire . " Did your friend Renfro show up like that by accident ? " " Does Michael Jordan have hair ? " Kneeling on the ground , Steve was clearing a circle of nature 's debris all the way down to pure earth for the fire . Summer had to think about that . " No , " she said at last . " Exactly . " Her brain was so fried from the events of the day that she had to think about that , too . " Are you trying to say that Renfro showing up was not an acci-dent ? " she asked finally , carrying her pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was chilled to the bone . Reaching over , she unzipped the gym bag and dragged the sweatshirt from its depths . " You got it . " While she pulled the sweatshirt on , he examined the sticks carefully , discarded a few , and began to arrange the others in a neat pile . The fleecy sweatshirt did nothing for the twin columns of ice that were her legs . She extracted the quilt from the gym bag and wrapped that around herself , too . " Did you contact him with smoke signals or ESP ? " She could n't help it . She felt sarcastic . She also felt like she was coming down with a cold . With her luck , it would probably turn into pneumonia . Not that the prospect concerned her particularly . At this point , pneumonia was way down on her list of things to worry about . He sent her a sidelong glance . " I used the phone in the manager 's office . After I saw that newspaper , I knew that hiding out at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put a lot of miles between 208 KAREN ROBARDS  | us and everybody who was hunting for us , fast . I 've known Renfro since I was a kid . He used to go fishing with me and my dad a lot , and sometimes we 'd ride dirt bikes . He 's a motorcycle nut , always has a bunch of them around in various stages of repair . He runs a souvenir shop with his dad on an Indian reservation about twenty-five miles from Hiawatha Village . When I called him and told him where I was and what I needed , he said no problemo . He 'd already read the papers , and from what I gathered he was n't all that surprised to hear from me . So when we had to run for it , we ran in the direction I knew he 'd be coming from . And there , in a nutshell , you have Plan B. " " It worked , " Summer admitted , inching closer to the cone-shaped pile of sticks as he ignited them with the always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be warm again in her life . " My plans always work , " Steve said with a smirk . " Oh , yeah ? Then what 's your plan for getting us out of this ? I do n't think Mexico is such a great idea . " Steve dug in the gym bag and came up with what was left of their food . He zipped the bag up again , and leaned back against the convenient trunk of a tall pine . " I do n't think so either , " he said , threading limp-looking hot dogs on a stick and passing it to Summer to hold . Summer tried not to think about the various kinds of food poisoning that could lurk in meat that had gone unrefrigerated for at least a day , and held the stick out over the fire . Dangerous or not , she was going to eat those hot dogs . She was starving . In her fur rug mode again between the two humans , Muffy yapped . Summer and Steve exchanged glances . Steve passed Muffy a **27;97;TOOLONG peanut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he continued , arranging buns on a rock , which he shoved close to the fire . " Running is not the solution here . Now that they 've set it up so that we 're wanted for murder , every police force in the whole U.S. is going to be looking for us . If they think we 've crossed state lines , the FBI will be after us . If they think we 've left the country , Interpol will be after us . The way our luck is running , we 'll probably be featured on next week 's America 's Most Wanted . The good cops  --  and they outnumber the bad by a wide margin , believe me  --  are now our enemies just as much as the bad cops ? and the bad guys who are not cops . The good cops will either arrest us and send us back to where the bad cops can get to us , or , if we resist , shoot to kill . That 's what I would do in their case . That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Shoot to kill ? " Summer echoed faintly . Steve nodded and began to thread marshmallows onto a stick . " You 've got to realize , we 're the bad guys now , " he said . " We 're criminals , wanted by the police . " " Oh , my God ! " Summer was appalled . " Maybe we better call a lawyer . My sister 's one ; then there 's the guy who handled my divorce . He did n't do such a good job , to tell you the truth , but maybe he could recommend ... " Steve was shaking his head . " We do n't need a lawyer . One thing we do n't have to worry about is beating criminal charges . If we 're caught , we wo n't ever make it to trial . Depending on who catches us , we might or we might not even make it to jail . " " Oh , " Summer said in a small voice . The reality of their situation was scary . " Pay attention ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recalled to the demands of the present , Summer quickly turned the hot dogs . Steve was right , the side that was now on top was black and bubbly . Good thing she liked her hot dogs that way . Heck , at this point she liked her hot dogs any way at all . " So what do we do ? " Summer could n't see a whole lot of options . But maybe , she consoled herself hopefully , she was just tired . " I think our best bet is to go back to the boat warehouse . We need to find out what is in that van that everybody wants so much . If it 's what I think it is , we contact the media with our story . If we can get the media behind us  --  and we have a good shot at it , they seem to love police-scandal stories  --  then we should be reasonably safe . " He glanced at the hot dogs , shook his head , and removed the stick from her hands . " I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably due to the fact that their dinner was as black as a cinder . " But we know what 's in the van . Dead bodies are in the van . " Summer accepted a hot dog , wrapped in a slightly stale-feeling but warm bun , that he passed her . " Baby , believe me , they 're not chasing us to hell and back just so they can pay their respects to the dead . " Steve bit into his own hot dog . Muffy whined . Summer absentmindedly broke off a bit of bun and fed it to her . " If there was n't something that they want very badly in that van , we 'd already be dead . And it 's not those bodies . " " What do you think it is , then ? " Summer tried to remember the interior of the van . She had n't seen anything besides the coffins and their contents , but then she had n't really looked . 210 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Drugs , probably . It could be any number of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smack , maybe . Not grass , it takes up too much room . " He removed a marshmallow from its stick and put it in his mouth whole . Then he popped open one of their two remaining cans of beer , and passed it to her . The other can , she saw , rested on the ground beside his leg . It was already open . Summer eyed it askance . " I hate beer , " was all she said . " Drink it . " She accepted the can with a grimace , propping it against her leg . Steve took a long swig from his can . There was so much else to worry about that Summer could n't summon more than a flicker of dismay over her self-confessed alcoholic 's apparently nonchalant consumption of beer . If the can even held beer . She was beginning to know him well enough to suspect it did not . " Water ? " She hazarded a guess , cocking a brow at the can . He looked at her in some surprise . " What makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't it ? " " Yeah . " " Thought so . " Her lip curled in satisfaction . She had n't been mistaken in her reading of his character . " Think you 're pretty smart , do n't you ? " he asked . " Yeah . " She had to smile . " Where 'd you get it ? " " I drained out the beer and filled the cans up with water from a tap at the campground when I came looking for you . See the little hole in the lid ? Easy . As long as you plug the hole with something . In this case , bubble gum . " " You mean mine 's water , too ? " Summer glanced at her can with genuine excitement . He nodded . She grinned at him and took a big swallow . The water was lukewarm and had a faintly metalic edge , but still it tasted wonderful . She drank again , then returned to the matter at hand . " Could you , please , tell me how you wound up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have started then . " Steve shook his head and devoured another marshmallow . " No , everything did n't start then . It actually started more than three years ago . This is something to do with the case I was working on when I ? when Deedee died . " He looked pensive suddenly , or as pensive as it was possible to look when licking marshmallow goo from one 's fingers . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 211  | " Go on , " she said a tad irritably . Deedee was beginning to get on her nerves . " You want to know the whole thing ? " His glance was inscrutable . " All right . It was supposed to be confidential , but under the circumstances I think you deserve to hear it . Hell , maybe you can help me figure it out . So far , I seem to be missing something . The key . " He laughed and fed Muffy the badly charred end of his hot dog without her even having to yap for it . Muffy gobbled up the morsel greedily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective with the Tennessee State Po-lice . " It was as much a question as a statement , and Summer nodded . " About three and a half years ago I was asked by my superiors to investigate possible corruption in a small-town police department . " He glanced at Summer , hesitated , and swigged his water . " Hell , you might as well know that it was the Murfreesboro Police Department . Chief Rosencrans made the request . It seemed that the corruption ? the alleged corruption  --  was so widespread in his department that he needed outside help in rooting it out . They were n't sure which , if any , of their own guys were clean . " " Then does n't that prove that Sammy 's not involved ? All we have to do is contact him and . . . " Summer broke in eagerly . Steve shook his head . " It does n't prove a thing . Did you ever hear of bluff and double bluff ? Just because Old Rosey asked us to investigate does n't mean he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be a good way to obscure his involvement in what was going on . Hell , I do n't know . When you 've been a detective as long as I have been  --  was , whatever  --  you learn never to take anything at face value . Just because it looks like a cow , and sounds like a cow , and smells like a cow , does n't mean that it is a cow , if you follow me . " Summer thought about that and nodded . Exhaustion was taking its toll . Her brain was not the sharpest it had ever been at that precise moment , but she was pretty sure she got the main idea : Maybe Sammy was a good guy , and maybe he was n't . " Anyway , I investigated , and I concluded that there was something rotten in Murfreesboro . Something really rotten . Those guys were being paid off by the bushelful  --  but by whom ? And why ? This was a hush-hush investigation . Nobody was supposed to know about it but my immediate superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Harmon Brothers funeral homes . Something was going down on the premises  --  a big-time drug operation , I 'm fairly 212 KAREN ROBARDS  | certain , though I never had a chance to prove it . Whether the funeral home people are involved , or just the premises themselves , I 'm not certain . I suspect at least some of the people  --  employees or owners ? have to be in on it , or they 'd be filing complaints about strangers coming and going at odd hours at their cemeteries . No complaints were filed . I checked . I also got whiffs that some high-society types around the state might be involved . Some politicians might be involved . And some cops might be involved . I was just getting pretty deep into it  --  and then Deedee died . " " She committed suicide , " Summer said softly , wanting him to face it . He glanced over at her , his expression suddenly harsh , intent . " Did she ? That 's that they said . Hell , there 's a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have an affair , and I did break it off kind of abruptly . But would Deedee hang herself over that ? I always did find that hard to believe . I just ca n't see Deedee killing herself over me . I ca n't see her killing herself at all . Deedee was n't the type . She was ? vibrant , I suppose , for want of a better word . She was the type to grab life with both hands and twist its tail until it gave her what she wanted . " " Maybe you just do n't want to see it . " Summer thought , hoped , that if she pressed him to get everything that had happened out in the open , it might have a healing effect . It was time and past that Deedee 's ghost was laid to rest . " Did n't she leave a suicide note , or , er , videotape ? " " Yeah . " The tips of Steve 's ears reddened . He took a sip of water and cast Summer a sidelong glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deedee ; you can bet your life I never saw the camera if it was ? videotaped us , uh , doing it . There was some pretty steamy footage on that tape  --  I know , because during the course of the investigation into whether or not I should be fired they made me watch it three times . Deedee was  --  a free spirit . She liked to try different things . Like being tied up , or having sex in unexpected places . " " Like on your desktop . " Summer 's voice was dry . She knew she was idiotic to resent any sexual encounters that he might have had before he even met her , and sexual encounters with a dead woman were certainly no threat  --  but she resented them , anyway . Because , she decided , to Steve , Deedee was very much alive . He even had visions of her ghost . She was shocked to realize how much she needed for him to put Deedee , living or dead , right out of his life . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 213 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ? " he asked , cocking a sardonic eyebrow at her . " Actually , I think I saw it on Hard Copy . " " Jesus . " Steve picked up his can as though to take a drink , then set it down again without doing so . " After the first thrill of making it with Deedee wore off  --  I 'd had the hots for her from afar for years , you understand  --  I started to feel guilty as hell . There was Elaine . She was my wife . We were in love when we got married , or at least I was in love . I ca n't speak for her . By the time the kid was born , the flame had flickered out . Still , we kept going through the motions . Do n't get me wrong , Elaine was  --  is  --  a good woman , a good mother . I 'm not going to say otherwise to try to justify what I did . " He picked up the can and this time guzzled about half the contents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth with the back of his hand and glanced at her . His eyes were unreadable , shiny black disks in the dark . " Even worse than Elaine , there was Mitch . Mitch is  --  was  --  my best friend . We went to kindergarten together . We went to elementary school together . We met Deedee together , when we were in high school . Mitch was the quarterback on our football team . I was the center . The only thing we did n't do together was join the Marines . He went to college instead . But when I got out of the service , I went to college too , and ended up in the state police with Mitch . He made detective the year before I did . Hell , when Elaine and I bought our house in Nashville , he bought one right down the street . He was there at the hospital passing out cigars the night my daughter was born . We hung out together . We were tight , tighter than a lot of brothers . I screwed my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , believe me . He broke off . His jaw hardened , and Summer was treated to a view of his stony profile as he stared into the fire . After a moment , as though he felt the weight of her unspoken sympathy , he slanted a brooding look her way . " Deedee and Mitch had been married forever , and he 'd been screwing around on her for years . Maybe she 'd been screwing around on him , too . I do n't know . How can anybody know ? Anyway , this time he was involved in an affair that Deedee seemed to think was pretty hot and heavy . She needed a shoulder to cry on , and whose better than mine ? We 'd been friends , all of us , for so long . I never meant what happened to happen . It just did . I was drinking one night , and she was lonely , and  --  it happened . " He covered his face with his hands  | suddenly . " God , if I could only take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only take it back , I would . " Looking at him , looking at the broad shoulders slumped now in defeat , at the bowed head , at this strong man suddenly brought low in an attitude of utter despair , Summer realized the sad truth : She was in love with him . God help her . And she could n't stand to see him hurting . Even if his pain was caused by his grief for another woman , she had to do what she could to ease the sting . She crawled over to him and wrapped her arms , quilt and all , comfortingly around his shoulders . And pressed her mouth to the unshaven , sandpaper roughness of his cheek . His hands fell away from his face . His head lifted , turned , and his black eyes bored into hers with blast furnace intensity .  | Except for the orange glow of light cast by the flickering flames , the forest was dark as pitch . Shadows from the fire leaped and danced like pagan phantoms among the black trunks of trees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squeaked . Summer studied the fathomless black eyes , the unhandsome , powerfully magnetic face , the wide shoulders , the rough black hair . She was in love with this man . The thought was so scary that it almost made her sick  --  but it was exhilarating , too . He tilted his head and kissed her mouth . Summer closed her eyes . It was a tender kiss , a sweet kiss , and the emotions it brought with it were so intense , she wanted to cry . Then , without warning , he broke off the kiss . Summer opened her eyes , bewildered , as he drew back . " This is a mistake . " His voice was unsteady . Hurt , Summer started to draw away in turn . But then she remembered that this was Steve , proud , unreachable Steve , whom she loved . Steve , who had been hurt and was still hurting . Steve , who needed her . Instead of giving up , she tightened her arms around his neck . Closing her eyes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When her mouth touched his he did not pull away , but neither did he re-216 KAREN ROBARDS  | spond . She might as well have been kissing a statue as she rubbed her lips sensuously against his weather-dry mouth . He was resisting her . Why ? Because of Deedee . Summer knew it instinctively . She and Deedee were locked in battle for Steve 's soul . Never mind that Deedee was dead . His lips stayed stubbornly closed against hers . Summer , who had never deliberately set out to seduce a man in her life , did now . She traced the outline of his mouth with her tongue , probing at the line where his lips joined . She could feel every muscle in his body stiffen as he fought against responding . " Make love to me , Steve , " she whispered against his mouth . Even his neck was rigid with resistance as she stroked its nape with gentle fingers , trying to coax his head down . " For both our sakes , I need to keep a clear head , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crawled into his lap , adjusting the quilt so that it cocooned both of them . Her arms wrapped around his neck . His raised knees and long , muscular thighs on the one side and warm abdomen and wide chest on the other made a nice cradle for her bottom . Her breasts brushed his chest . His hands , quite of their own volition she was sure , found and tightened on her waist . " You do n't need a clear head tonight . " He could have put her off his lap easily . Summer knew he could ; she had experienced his strength before . And he was certainly ruthless enough not to care about hurting her if ridding himself of her was truly what he wanted . But it was n't . She knew it was n't . " Summer . . . " Despite his protests , those black eyes were fixed on her mouth . " Shhh . " Summer put a finger to his lips to silence him . She could n't stop looking at him . She was so close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bruise , every scar on his skin . She could see , individually , the thousands of stubbly hairs that made up the rough black shadow that darkened his jaw , the faint puffiness that still distorted the right side of his face , the yellowing edges of a deep purple bruise on his forehead , the discolored circles around his eyes . The gash over his cheekbone was just starting to heal ; so was the one at the corner of his mouth . His battered state should have lessened his appeal , but , oddly , it did n't . He looked like a weary gladiator , this man she loved , she decided as she absorbed everything about his face from the bushiness of his black eyebrows and the bump in the bridge of the harsh blade WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 217  | that was his nose , to the unexpectedly tender curve of his lower lip above a mulish jaw . " Look , I do n't want to get involved . . . . " His breathing was uneven . Summer smiled at him tenderly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already too late . " She moved then , lifting her mouth toward him at the same time as she drew his head down to hers . He let her pull him down  --  she was under no illusions that he could not have stopped her if he chose  --  but that was all the encouragement he gave her . Summer closed her eyes and touched her lips to his , softly at first , in a butterfly kiss that tantalized . No response . Coaxing , her mouth stroked his , begging , promising . Still he resisted  --  but the sudden harsh indrawing of his breath told her all she needed to know . This was a battle she was going to win . He felt big and warm and solid against her . Summer snuggled closer , shifting so that she was half lying against his chest , her breasts pressed close against the hard muscles there , her arms locked around his neck . He opened his mouth to say something  --  make some other protest , no doubt  --  but she forestalled him by sliding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his muscles had tightened in a single spasmodic jerk . Would he fight to the end , this gladiator of hers ? Summer drew back her head , her lids opening languorously . The black eyes blazed down at her , as scorching as the embers of their fire . She kissed him , softly , briefly . Still he did n't surrender . Summer smiled at him as her breasts mizzled into his chest . His eyes narrowed and his jaw hardened . Summer could feel the momentary cessation in his breathing . Then , " To hell with it , " he muttered thickly , and his mouth came swooping down on hers . He kissed her as if he were starving for the taste of her mouth . His lips and tongue alternately caressed and plundered , while his arms locked around her waist and back , holding her as if he never meant to let her go . Summer met his greediness with her own need , her arms wound tight about his neck , her head thrown back against his shoulder . She felt suddenly weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She doubted that she could sit up on her own if he should release her . Not that there was any chance of that . She could feel his passion building like steam in a pressure cooker ; already she was being seared 218 KAREN ROBARDS  | by its heat . He had taken over the kiss completely ; she merely followed where he led . When his mouth left hers at last to slide hotly across her cheek to her ear , Summer moaned . He nipped the tender lobe , his teeth arousing rather than punishing , then kissed the soft skin below it . " I want you , " he murmured , his breath warm against her ear . Uttered in a hoarse , ragged voice , the phrase was incredibly sexy . Summer began to tremble . " I want you too . " She threaded her fingers up through his hair and pressed her mouth to the warm hollow below his ear . She could feel the racing of his pulse against her lips . He was leaning back against the trunk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs curled around his , the quilt covering them both . His hand slid up to cradle the back of her head as he tilted her so that his mouth could have easy access to the softness of her throat . Summer closed her eyes against a momentary glimpse of bats swooping after insects across a night-dark sky and refused to allow herself to remember where they were or why . She blocked out everything except the feel of Steve 's hands and mouth and body . He was what she wanted , what she needed just Steve . His mouth traced its way down her neck , nibbling and sucking and licking at the soft column . Finally he reached the throbbing hollow at the base of her throat . He stopped there for a moment , his lips pressed against her skin . She could feel the hardness of his mouth , the roughness of his unshaven jaw , the warm wetness of his tongue as it lazily explored the soft depression . Then one large , warm hand found her breast . Summer 's head swam . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of sweatshirt and T-shirt and bra . He found the eager bud , stroked it with his thumb , then took it between his fingers , gently rolling it back and forth . The pleasure was so intense that Summer gasped . She was suddenly starving for the feel of his skin against hers . Her hands slid down his chest , burrowing under the Nike shirt , reveling in the feel of the hard , hair-covered flesh . She stroked his chest , his belly . He was warm , so warm  --  all she wanted was to get closer to that warmth . Her questing fingers encountered the waistband of his shorts . She found the button , freed it , tugged the zipper down . His mouth burned the skin of her neck , his hand on her breast went suddenly rigid , and WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 219  | she got the impression that he had ceased to breathe . Then her fingers slid beneath his briefs , across his tightening abdomen , to close around the huge , hot , hungry part of him that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers closed on him he groaned , then groaned again . Suddenly he was rolling with her , flipping her onto her back with such urgency that she lost her bearings and had to cling to his shoulders as the only solid things in a shifting world . They were tangled , momentarily , in the quilt . With a muttered oath , he jerked free of it , casting it aside . Then he was on top of her , his body hard and heavy , his breathing coming in fast , ragged pants . His mouth fastened on hers with a greedy passion that stoked an answering fire in her . Summer kissed him back hotly , wanting his lovemaking with a fierceness that she would never , before this day , before Steve , have believed herself capable of feeling . With the tiny part of her brain that was still functional , she realized he was what she had been seeking for years . A man who needed her ; a man to love : Steve . His hands were unsteady as he undressed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sweatshirt zipper all the way down , he gave up and jerked the garment over her head . Summer was still wearing her T-shirt and bra , and , impatient , he merely tugged those out of his way , leaving them twisted beneath her armpits . As his fingers found her breasts , closing over the soft mounds in a grip that should have hurt but did n't , she moaned and forgot all about trying to help him work the fastenings on her clothes . He kissed her breasts , and she thought she would die with the sheer exquisite pleasure of it . Then suddenly , abruptly , his hands and mouth were removed . She opened her eyes to discover that he had left her to tug off his shorts , his shirt , his shoes . Hands shaking , she sat up to help him , running her mouth greedily over his body as they both pulled at his clothes . When he was done , it was her turn . He yanked her T-shirt and her bra over her head without bothering to unfasten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bent his head to kiss her , but she eluded him . She had different prey in mind . With her hands on his shoulders she pressed him down on the smooth , slick carpet of fallen leaves , kissing his neck , running her mouth over the warm , hair-roughened skin of his chest , nibbling at his tightening abdomen , on the way to her prize . When she found him with her mouth , he groaned . He was huge and 220 KAREN ROBARDS  | hot and hard as she kissed him , licked him , swallowed him whole . His muscles clenched , his eyes closed , and for a moment , as she took him higher and higher , she reveled in her power . He was hers , all hers , and she was claiming him . Then his hands tangled in her hair , pulling her away from him , pulling her up . He turned with her , flipping her onto her back and yanking down her shorts and panties with a quick series of near-frenzied movements . Her shorts and panties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes , but he could n't wait to strip her properly . With a groan he came down on top of her again . Her knees parted of their own volition and her arms wrapped around his neck as she welcomed him . He thrust home with hard urgency , and Summer gasped . His answering growl enflamed her . She rose and fell with her own urgent need as he moved in , then out , then in again in a relentless , driving rhythm . Her head was thrown back , her mouth wide open as he took her , and she took him , too . Her nails dug deep into his muscled back ; her thighs squeezed his hips . She was mindless with pleasure , delirious with it , trembling with it . There was no room in her head for anything except the wonder of her own need  --  and the knowledge that this was Steve . His hands closed over her buttocks , lifting her so that he could thrust more deeply inside her , and with a harsh groan his mouth clamped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand no more . Pleasure more intense than anything she had ever imagined burst gloriously inside her . " Oh , Steve ! Steve ! Steve ! " She shuddered and clung , crying out her joy into the endless dark . He responded with one final , savage thrust and his own harsh cry , shaking as he held himself inside her . Then , with the suddenness of a passing storm , it was over . Summer lay limply on the ground , conscious of a steadily increasing litany of discomfort . There was a hummock of grass between her shoulder blades . Her legs were freezing . The big lummox collapsed atop her weighed a ton . And it was starting to rain .  | " It 's raining . " Summer kissed his bristly cheek . " Mmm ? " Steve did n't open his eyes , did n't lift his head , did n't smile at her , did n't move . " I said it 's raining . " A fat drop plopped on her nose to underline the point . She shoved at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His eyes opened then . The dangerous black depths glinted at her for a moment , and then he stirred , kissing her nose . " You 're beauti-ful , " he said . " So are you , " she answered , smiling . " I bet you say that to all the guys . " He fluttered his eyelashes at her in exaggerated flirtatiousness . " Nope . Only the handsome ones . " He laughed . " I 've been called lots of things in my life , but never handsome . " " Obviously you 've been hanging out with the wrong kind of woman . " " Obviously . " Another drop splattered on Summer 's forehead . Suddenly Muffy was there beside her , whining , peering anxiously down into her face . Summer was n't sure , but she did n't think Muffy had ever been out in the rain before . 222 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Damned voyeuristic mutt , " Steve muttered . " Bet she watched the whole thing . " He rolled off Summer and sat up , knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what appeared to be a wary look around , seemingly paying particular attention to the lower branches of nearby trees . For what ? Summer wondered , and then she figured it out . The fire hissed and sizzled as another few raindrops hit . " Looking for Deedee ? " Summer asked sweetly , sitting up and restoring her shorts and panties to their proper position . Steve glanced at her , narrowed his eyes , pursed his lips , and finally nodded . " I think she 's haunting me . " Summer could n't help it . Despite the half-joshing tone of his voice , she saw red . She had n't won the battle to lose the war ! She grabbed a pine cone from the ground and heaved it at him . It caught him on the chin . " Hey ! " he said , rubbing his chin and looking surprised . " What was that for ? " Summer threw another one . It hit its target too . Then she scrambled to her feet and loomed over him , catching him by both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his upturned face with her nose no more than six inches from his . " I do n't want to hear another word about Deedee ! Not so much as another syllable , understand ? " For a moment he looked almost alarmed . Then he grinned , reached up , grabbed her around her waist , and pulled her down onto his lap . " I like my women jealous , " he said , and kissed her . His hands found and fondled her bare breasts . He was naked and she was half so and his kiss was setting her afire ... . A shower of raindrops broke them apart . " It 's going to storm , " he said , lifting his head to the distant sound of thunder . " We 've got to find some kind of shelter . " " What do you suggest ? " She knew as well as he did that there was no shelter around for miles . " Pack everything up but the quilt . I 've got an idea . " Summer got dressed , then did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shoes and vanished into the trees . In the distance lightning flickered briefly across the sky . The wind blew more raindrops across the clearing . Their fire sizzled and danced . It was going to pour at any minute . " Come on . " Steve reappeared , kicked out the fire , grabbed the gym WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 223  | bag and Muffy , and headed back into the trees . Somehow Summer did n't think a forest was the best place to be during a thunderstorm , but , hugging the quilt to her bosom , she followed . She would follow those broad shoulders to hell and back . Beneath a sheltering grove of what , from the smell of them , seemed to be cedars , he had thrown together a crude shelter consisting of one picnic table turned upside down atop another one  --  this , Summer presumed , was to make doubly sure the rain did n't drip through the cracks in the top  --  with pine branches leaning against the sides . " Give me the quilt . " She passed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spread the quilt on the ground . Raindrops began to fall in earnest . Summer joined him in a hurry . When they were settled , they lay spoon fashion , cocooned in the quilt , with Summer 's T-shirted back snuggled against Steve 's bare chest , and his arms around her waist . Their heads rested on the gym bag . Their shoes , and Summer 's socks , sat side by side near one jury-rigged wall . Thunder rolled ominously . Rain began to fall in a steady stream . Muffy whined and looked with piteous entreaty at Summer . Summer pulled the little dog against her chest and wrapped the quilt around her , too . The three of them were unexpectedly cozy in their makeshift shelter with the rain coming down all around but not touching them . The air was cool , and damp , and smelled of rain and leaves . The patter of raindrops hitting the top of their shelter was soothing . With Steve 's arms around her , Summer was warm and dry , and , despite the circumstances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend . " Steve 's voice was a low rumble in her ear . Summer slanted a glance back over her shoulder at him , smiling to herself . " He 's a very good dentist , " she said demurely . " Do you sleep with him ? " " That , " Summer said , wriggling around so that she was facing him and then tweaking his nose , " is none of your business . " " Oh , yeah ? " " Yeah . " " You planning to see him again ? " " You mean if we survive this ? " " That 's what I mean . " Summer eyed him . " Maybe . " 224 KAREN ROBARDS  | " Maybe ? " His black eyes narrowed . " Depends on if I have a reason not to see him again . " " Like what kind of reason ? " " I do n't know  --  like maybe if there was somebody new in my life . " " Is there ? " " Mmm . " " That 's no answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get . " " Oh , yeah ? " He kissed her mouth , his lips warm and leisurely and entirely proprietary . " Know what ? I think there 's somebody new in your life . " " I thought you did n't want to get involved . " He smiled lazily at her . The effect of that smile at such close quarters was devastating . " I do n't . But like you said , I think it 's already too late . " " Really ? " " Uh-huh . " " You 're involved ? " " Looks like it , does n't it ? " " So what about Deedee ? " Steve sighed , and rolled onto his back , bringing with him Summer , the quilt , and Muffy , who was tangled up in it . Muffy , indignant at being treated with so little consideration , wriggled out the end of the cocoon to hunch indignantly just inside the shelter . Neither human paid the least attention to her . " Baby , I think you 've got hold of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We never had the kind of love affair that you seem to think we did . What was between us was never meant to be a forever kind of thing . She and I both knew that all along . All right , so I keep thinking that I see her . I ca n't help it . Damn it , I know she 's dead , and I do n't believe in ghosts . So you want to hear the only explanation I can come up with ? " " What 's that ? " Summer , lying sprawled atop him securely swathed in quilt , lifted her head , folding her hands on his chest and propping her chin on them as she looked down into his face . " I never saw her before I met you . Not once , in the three years since she died . I think I 'm seeing her now because of guilt over the way I feel when I 'm with you . " " Really ? " Summer looked down at him hopefully . " Really . " WALKING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're with me ? " Steve grinned . " Horny . " Summer pinched his chest . He yelped , rubbing the injured spot . " Is that all ? " She glared at him . " Hey , it works for me . " Summer pursed her lips and rolled off him , crossing her arms over her chest and presenting her back to him with a flounce . " What more do you want ? " he protested , leaning up on one elbow to peer down into her averted face . " From you ? " Summer laughed . " Not a thing . " " Now you 're mad at me . " He dropped a kiss on her ear . She elbowed him sharply in the chest . He grunted , cringing , and then leaned over her again . " I suppose you want me to tell you that I think we 've got something special going here . That with you and me , maybe it is a forever kind of thing . Is that it ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even want you to speak to me . I ? " " Well , " he interrupted , his breath warm as he spoke into her ear . " That 's just what I think . " It took a moment for that to sink in . " What ? " She turned over so that she could see his face . He smiled at her , rather ruefully , she thought . " You heard me , " he said . " Repeat that . " " Not on your life . " " Steve Calhoun , are you trying to say that you 've fallen in love with me ? " " I guess . " " You guess ? " At the indignation clear in her face and voice , he backtracked hastily . " All right , I know . I think . " " You think ? " This time it was n't indignation she felt . It was outrage , pure and simple . " Jesus , Summer , what do you want ? " " I want you to tell me , straight out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that 's what you 're trying to say . " He stared at her without speaking for a moment . They were facing each other , lying on their sides swathed in the quilt , their heads inches apart on the blue nylon gym bag . Summer , rigid with temper , had both 226 KAREN ROBARDS  | arms crossed firmly over her chest . Steve reached down , grasped both her hands with his , and pulled them , not without some token resistance on her part , free . Then he carried them to his mouth , and pressed a kiss against the knuckles of both hands . " I think that maybe , just maybe , you were sent to rescue me from outer darkness , " he said quietly . " When I first encountered you , in that funeral home , I did n't really care if I lived or died . Now I do . " " Steve , " she whispered , touched to the heart by his words , and the infinite tenderness in his black eyes . " Hush , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got me started . For years , I have n't been able to look into the future with any kind of hope or joy . Now , when I think of a future  --  of being with you in my future ? I feel both . Does that mean I 've fallen in love with you ? Who knows ? But I 'm willing to give it a shot  --  if you are . " " Oh , Steve . " Looking searchingly into his eyes , Summer realized how sincerely he meant what he said . Her heart swelled . They were two people , damaged by life , who had somehow found in each other what they needed to heal their wounds . And that was a miracle . There was no other word for it . Summer snuggled closer , freeing her hands to stroke his bristly cheeks , trace the hard line of his mouth , tenderly touch the healing bruises . " If you ca n't come right out and say it , I can : I 'm in love with you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lopsided little smile . " Yeah , " she answered softly , and kissed his mouth . Peering in through the makeshift shelter 's entrance , a **30;126;TOOLONG angel gave a rousing cheer . Which neither of the two principals to the conversation heard . Though Muffy did , and cocked her head in wonderment.  | That night , the heavens celebrated . Thunder roared approval . Lightning cracked in laudatory bursts across the sky . Rain pelted down in never-ending applause . Summer and Steve , wrapped up in the quilt and each other , heard none of it . She told him the truth of what it had been like to be married to Lem , about the bulimia she had developed as a result , about how hard it had been to heal herself and become whole again . He told her about how he 'd been drinking too much for years , about how , when his life had exploded in his face , he 'd gone off the deep end and lit out on the bender to end all benders : a lost weekend that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lem had left her to marry his twenty-two-year-old nurse . He told her that grief over the mess he 'd gotten himself into had caused his father 's death . And they held each other , and cried , and laughed , and made love ? and healed . " So what made you decide to come back ? " Summer asked sleepily several hours later , as the tale of Steve 's wanderings over the last three years came to a close . He was lying on his back and her head was cradled on his shoulder . The ground was hard . The air was cold . Pine needles prickled through 228 KAREN ROBARDS  | the quilt in places to jab her most sensitive parts . Summer did n't care . Naked , swathed in the quilt and warmed by the blast-furnace heat of Steve 's body , she felt blissfully , foolishly happy . Beneath the palm she had pressed to Steve 's hair-roughened chest , she could feel the steady beat of his heart . " To Tennessee , you mean ? " One hard-muscled arm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer 's shoulders . As he spoke , his gaze was fixed on the raw planks of their makeshift ceiling . Summer immediately thought of him imagining Deedee lurking around up there somewhere , but dismissed the suspicion as unworthy . She had a gut feeling that Steve would n't be seeing Deedee anymore . At least , she added to herself fiercely , not if he knew what was good for him ! " Well , as I told you , I was out in Nevada . My credit cards and my savings had taken me a long way , but by this time I was about broke . I woke up one afternoon in a whorehouse  --  Mabel 's , where the motto is The customer always comes first . There was a girl beside me , and we were both naked  --  ow , do n't punch me ! ? but I could n't remember how I got there , or a single thing we 'd done . She was a hell of a goodlooking girl , too . " Steve smiled reminiscently , then yelped as Summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest hair . " Jesus , you 're vicious . " He slanted a glance down at her , grinned , and continued . " I could n't even remember what day it was . So I asked her , and she said Christmas Eve . That made me feel kind of sick . So I got up , got dressed , and went back to the hotel I 'd been staying in . It was a cheap hotel , twenty-five bucks a night . They changed the sheets maybe once a week . " He took a deep breath . " So I started thinking about Christmas , and I picked up the phone and called my daughter . I had n't talked to her for a while , because every time I called Elaine said she did n't want to talk to me . But this time my daughter answered . I said I loved her , Merry Christmas . She said , I hate you , Daddy , ' and hung up the phone . " The pain in Steve 's voice was as tangible as his heartbeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snuggling closer , kissing the side of his neck in silent sympathy . " Children always say that to their parents . I know my nephews and nieces do . " It was poor comfort , Summer knew , but the best she could offer . " I know . " He sounded tired . " But it was like she 'd slapped my face . WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 229  | It shocked me into taking stock of myself . I saw the sorry thing I 'd become  --  a dirty drunk sleeping with whores  --  and knew I had to make some changes . I took a shower , cleaned up , shaved . Then I went to church  --  it was a little Methodist church , sitting up on a hill in the middle of that podunk town  --  and I  --  well , hell , I prayed . Then the whole congregation started coming in . It was Christmas Eve , remember . There was a candlelight service . I stayed for that , too . When it was over , I knew I had to do my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Summer listened , spellbound , to the deep rumble of his voice . His heartbeat was slow and steady beneath her hand . He went on : " I quit drinking , there and then , cold turkey . With God 's help , I have n't had a drink from that day to this . I got tested for AIDS . I was clean , you do n't have to worry . Then I headed home , meaning to do my best to earn my daughter 's forgiveness . On the way back , I started to think things through . Right after Deedee died , I was too shocked to see real clearly , but since I had quit drinking the fog was beginning to lift . I had a hard time believing that Deedee had committed suicide you would have had to know Deedee to under-stand  --  but I had n't questioned it , before . Now I started to . She 'd left behind that videotape , remember . Besides the , uh , sex , it also had her saying that she was going to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my wife . Hell , I never said that . I never left my wife , and I broke off with Deedee mainly because of Mitch . She knew that , had a screaming fit about it in fact . So what she said on the tape just did n't fit . " He hesitated for a minute , frowning up at the ceiling . " And then there was the key . " " What key ? " " The key to my office . It was a temporary office in Nashville , one I was using just while I worked on the investigation I was telling you about . I 'd only been in it about a month . Because of the sensitive nature of the case , I had the locks changed on that office when I moved into it , and I locked it every single night , no exceptions . I locked it the night Deedee died in there . So how did she get in ? She did n't have a key . There was only one , and it was either in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every single minute of every single day . She and Elaine had never much liked each other  --  maybe Elaine sensed that I 'd always had a soft spot for Deedee , I do n't know ? so Deedee was hardly ever at my house . She could n't possibly have sneaked the key out of my desk drawer while I was asleep or anything like that . She had n't been inside my house at all since we started 230 KAREN ROBARDS  |p230slee|ping  together , I know . My office was locked , and she did n't have a key . So what did she do ? Break in ? Deedee weighed about ninety pounds , and she was anything but mechanical , and anyway there were no signs of a break-in . So how did she get into my office to hang herself ? And why would she do it there , and leave behind that videotape , anyway ? She was gon na be dead by the time it was found , so the only one it would hurt was me . Deedee was mad , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her life would have been to deliberately cause trouble for me . " " So what are you saying ? That you do n't think she killed herself ? " " I do n't see how she could have . But if she did n't , who killed her , and why ? The only possible reason to take her out the way they did was to do harm to me , but why , if somebody 's aim was to harm me , did n't they just kill me and have done with it ? Shooting me would have been a hell of a lot easier than going through the whole elaborate setup somebody had to go through if Deedee was murdered . I ca n't make sense out of it . I could n't when I first started trying to work it out , and I ca n't now . There 's a piece of the puzzle missing , and I ca n't find it . So I decided the only thing to do was go back over the investigation I was working on when she died . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , looking for something , anything , that I might have missed the first time around . That 's what I was doing outside that funeral home that night , and that 's how we ended up here . " " Because of Deedee , " Summer said thoughtfully . " I 'm starting to feel like I know her . " " She would have liked you . " He grinned down at her suddenly . " She was an ornery , fiesty little fighter , and she liked those qualities in other women . She always said Elaine was a wimp . I do n't think she thought Elaine was good enough for me . " " It sounds like she was right . " Summer realized that she was talking about Deedee like she was an old friend . In fact , she was almost beginning to feel that way . Steve talked about her with affection and nostalgia  --  but not love , she was beginning to understand . Or at least , not the kind of love he offered her . Maybe she 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she never had been . They were silent for a few minutes . Then Summer said softly , " Do you really think we have much chance of getting out of this alive ? " Steve slanted a glance down at her . " Baby , we are gon na get out of this alive . Trust me . " She did , but , but . . . but she could n't think about anything at all WALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 231  | when he was rolling over with her and kissing her like that . And maybe , she thought with her last dim glimmer of intelligence , that was precisely what he had in mind . Then she gave herself up to his hands and mouth and body , and did n't think again for a very long time . Dawn broke early . The rain had stopped sometime during the night , and the sunrise was beautiful  --  a fat orange sun painting the sky gorgeous shades of pinks and purples , so that the mountains were wreathed in lavender clouds and the tips of the piney forests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vapor drifted across the ground to rise toward the sky as if an invisible bride were climbing heavenward , trailing behind her yards of gossamer wedding veil . Summer saw all this because the spot where she and Steve had spent the night was beside a true scenic overlook , with only a low stone wall between them and an unfettered view encompassing miles of mountain and valley and sky . Perched on the rim of the mountain , they crawled out of their shelter and came face-to-face with a breathtaking panorama of beauty . A vast wooded valley lay below , punctuated by a small bright lake . The sheer grandeur of the scene spread out before them should have embued them with awe , or at the very least a little appreciation . Steve gave their brave new world a single cursory glance and headed straight for the motorcycle , which he fussed over as tenderly as if it were his bride and this was the morning after their wedding . Dirty , rumpled , and disgruntled , Summer watched his ministrations to his machine with a darkling eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lavished more care on his steed than his beloved . Steve had kissed her awake as soon as the first creeping tendril of light found them in their shelter . Summer had returned his kiss sleepily , but her body had been warm and willing , primed by the passion that had blazed between them through the night . She had wrapped her arms around his neck , offering herself up to his hands with a voluptuous sigh . Then , instead of starting the morning in the lusty fashion she fully expected after the night they had spent , he had squeezed her breast , smacked her bottom , and told her to get dressed : he wanted to get an early start . So much for romance . Thus , Summer admired the dawn while perched on top of a picnic table near the stone wall , while Steve labored over the stupid motorcycle . She and Muffy sat there alone , on what appeared to be the edge 232 KAREN ROBARDS  | of the world , sharing the last of the peanut butter crackers . Not far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plugs on the end of his shirt and replaced them in their sockets . For his breakfast , he had chosen to polish off the marshmallows as he worked . Apparently , Summer reflected dourly , the excessive sweetness had gone to his brain . When the spark plugs were connected and the seat was dried and the gym bag was packed and secured to his satisfaction , Steve at last turned his attention to his female companions . His eyes widened as he caught the expression on Summer 's face . " Are you always this grumpy early in the morning , or is this my lucky day ? " he asked with a maddening grin . " Are you always this cheerful early in the morning ? " she responded with a poisonously sweet smile . " If you are , we may want to rethink this whole relationship . " " That 's my little ray of sunshine , " he said , laughing , and came over to drop a kiss on her mouth . His mouth was warm , his beard scratchy . Summer responded simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stroking her lips so sensuously with his tongue because he was seeking cracker crumbs , and she pushed him away . " Hey , " he protested . " Last night you liked kissing me . " " Last night is history , pal . " " Is that your way of saying that the honeymoon is over ? " He grinned . " Not on your life , Rosencrans . " " Oh , yeah ? " " Yeah . " He moved close again , his hands finding her waist and pulling her over to the edge of the picnic table , where he positioned himself between her knees . " Kiss me , beautiful . " Her hands were on his shoulders . He had pulled her to the very edge of the picnic table , and her spread thighs gripped his hips while her feet in their giant sneakers dangled into space . Their position was suggestive in the extreme , and Summer was n't sure she was in the mood for what it was suggesting . She was tired , hungry , dirty , scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment  --  so of course he had to start thinking about getting laid . Men ! She looked at him with her head cocked a little to one side as his eyes glinted at her with something that was not quite a smile in their depths . The swelling had left his face , though the bruising and a pair of beautiful shiners remained , and she was able to see without distorWALKING AFTER MIDNIGHT 233  | tion the rugged features of the man she loved . His cheekbones were high and flat , his jaw square , his lips on the thin side . His skin was pitted in places . His nose was a harsh blade . His was a hard face , a tough face , a give-no-quarter face  --  and she was entranced by every square inch of it . He was big , dark , dangerous  --  and hers . No matter how out of sorts she felt , just looking at him gave her a thrill . She scowled at him . He repaid the compliment by sliding his hand suggestively up her thigh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her panties , then slipped inside . She batted his hand away . " I thought you were in a hurry to get on the road , " she reminded him , although the heat from his hand had communicated itself to her and she was in no great rush herself . " Ah , well , " he said , smiling faintly . " I think there may be a slight change in plan . " The sun was well up in the sky before they finally got under way . The night had done nothing to cure her saddle-soreness , Summer discovered as they headed back in the direction from which they had come . As soon as the vibration started up again , her bottom began to ache . By the time an hour had passed , her feet were asleep , her back felt like it was breaking , and there was a nagging pain in her calves . She rested her head between Steve 's shoulder blades and tried to forget about her discomfort . Finally she realized that that was impossible . She realized something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least kept her from feeling afraid . They were headed right back into the lions ' den , and Summer was n't sure that was a really good idea . She was so worn out , she could n't make up her mind what she thought they should do . At last she gave it up . Trust me , Steve had said . For better or worse , that was what she was going to do . She leaned back , flexing her neck , hoping to at least ease the ache at the base of her skull . Muffy lay across her lap beneath her T-shirt like a rag doll . The poor dog , innured to misery by this time , confined her protests at this uncomfortable mode of transportation to an occasional low moan . The day was growing increasingly hotter , the helmet was giving Summer a blinding headache , and she felt like moaning herself . The only thing that kept her from it was the conviction that the 234 KAREN ROBARDS  | situation was only going to get worse . She might as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they might be truly needed . It was terrifying to consider that she  --  and Steve  --  might die today . So she concentrated on her aches and pains , and refused to think at all . It must have been about three p.m. when Summer saw it : A small biplane , tracing lazy patterns through the soft blue sky , trailing a long white advertising banner behind it . She had often seen such planes with their messages about all-you-can-eat specials and two-for-one drinks from the beaches of Florida . She was vaguely surprised to find one soaring above the thickly wooded Smoky Mountains . It looked out of place , incongruous somehow , and she watched it curiously . Finally it drew close enough so that she could just make out the message on the banner : Steve . Where 's Corey ? Call 555-2101 . Summer gasped , staring , and read the message a second time . Then she poked Steve hard in the ribs .  | " Corey 's my daughter , " Steve said , his voice hoarse . He was standing by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was disappearing behind a cloud-bedecked peak . Sum-mer 's arms were around his waist . He did n't have to spare her a glance to know that her eyes , fixed on his face , were wide with concern . After Summer had directed his attention to the plane and its banner , he had nearly run off the road as he read the message once and then again . There was absolutely no doubt that that message was aimed at him . Corey . They had taken Corey . He thought of his daughter , a little plump , a little shy , with soft brown bangs that were always falling into her eyes and unbecoming plaid pleated skirts required by the parochial school she attended , and then remembered : The picture of her that he had held so long in his heart was Corey at age ten . She was thirteen now , a teenager , God help him . She would have changed . They would hurt Corey , torture Corey , kill Corey , to get at him . Adrenaline pumped through Steve 's veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a sickening leap . Oh , God , why had he never considered that they might go after Corey ? In his agitation , he nearly drove them over a cliff . Only Summer 's horrified screech recalled him to the present in time
