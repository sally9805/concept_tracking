<p> It may seem ironic that a symposium on global population should have taken place at Green Gulch in the Zen-owned conference center among the wooded canyons and open rolling hills of Marin . <p> Perhaps the affair would better have been held on Market Street  --  or in Addis Ababa or any place where the consequences of overpopulation would be immediately visible . ( In Nigeria , for example , if the population continued to grow at the present rate for 140 years  --  impossible , because starvation would come first  --  it would equal the present population of the Earth : 5.5 billion . ) <p> However , the Marin site may have been appropriate from another standpoint ; these are the kind of pastoral scenes that would disappear in California and elsewhere under the impact of a constantly growing population . <p> Unlike most population conferences , this one , to which the sponsoring Elmwood Institute had invited a dozen experts from the United States and overseas , was not to be devoted to hand- wringing over the " population bomb " or arguments over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Envisioning a Sustainable World Population . " <p> It was clear from the beginning that the participants were going to go beyond the often-heard and incontrovertible axiom that unlimited growth can not continue indefinitely on a limited planet . ( The Earth 's population has doubled since 1950 and is headed for another doubling . ) <p> Most of the conferees agreed that even the present population is more than the Earth can permanently sustain . The impact of 5.5 billion people , in the words of ecologist Raymond Dasmann , is " unraveling the Earth 's life-support systems "  --  the soil , the forests , the climatic balance , the diverse species of plants and animals . <p> Planned Parenthood president Fay Wattleton struck a note that resounded throughout the two-day symposium : The population problem will not be solved without a greater measure of equality for women everywhere , particularly higher levels of education and access to contraception . <p> Futurist Hazel Henderson , author of " Paradigms in Progress : Life Beyond Economics , " agreed but added that education of women is not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to bear more children . " Education of women , " she said , " ca n't eliminate violence against women . " <p> Lindsey Grant , author of " Cornucopian Fallacies , " carried the point further : Abuse of wives , he said , is often perpetrated by men who feel powerless against poverty and vent their rage at home . <p> Betsy Hartmann , director of the population program at Hampshire College , added that one root of Third World poverty is the dispossession of farmers and the concentration of land ownership in an elite class . Vandana Shiva , feminist author from India , pointed out that the Indian state of Kerala has lowered its population growth with reform programs including health care , family planning and land ownership for small farmers . Large families , she said , are a form of social security and are no longer necessary when land ownership and other forms of security are available . <p> At the end of the two days , there was a surprising measure of consensus among the participants ; the result was a 13-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affirmation that the global population impact is not simply a Third World problem but is equally the responsibility of the industrialized countries that consume the bulk of the world 's resources . <p> To reduce that impact in the industrial countries , the statement recommends five levels of intervention :  --  Individuals can choose a modest consumption lifestyle , " green " buying habits and small families .  --  Local communities can legislate such measures as water conservation and pollution control .  --  Corporations can " eco-audit " their activities and adopt more environmentally benign technologies .  --  Nations can prohibit such damaging substances as leaded gasoline , DDT and ozone-destroying CFCs . They can change the " national scorecard " from the gross national product ( or gross domestic product ) to alternative indicators that account for pollution and resource depletion.  --  Internationally it is necessary to counteract the attempts by multinational corporations , in the name of free trade , to concentrate their operations in countries where environmental regulations , if any , are most lenient . <p> The declaration also made these points :  --  Population control involving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper way to reduce population is to create programs that make people want to participate : a wider distribution of wealth , both within nations and between North and South ( the industrial world and the Third World ) and full equality for women , including education , job opportunities , freedom of reproductive choice and an end to coercion and violence .  --  The cost of such programs could largely be met by diverting resources now going to military purposes at the global rate of about $ 1 trillion a year . <p> The Green Gulch Declaration furnishes a broad framework of principles that can lead to specific programs . ( For a full text of the declaration , write The Elmwood Institute at P.O. Box 5765 , Berkeley , CA 94705 . ) However , when I discussed the Green Gulch approach with the Sierra Club Bay Chapter population committee , some members felt that at a time when the world is being swamped by population growth , the Green Gulch principles are too slow and cumbersome . We ca n't wait , they felt , until wealth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need more coercion , not less , some said . We should refuse aid or debt relief to any country that does not have an effective family planning program and mandatory education in population matters . Our aid should go to each country in proportion to its success in reducing family size . <p> Unfortunately , Americans and citizens of other industrial countries look at population as a problem of Third World peoples only . If we insist that they reduce their population growth or else . . . their likely response is to regard our demands as neo-colonialism and to resist accordingly . <p> We need to clean up our own act . We need not only a U.S. population policy but national and local programs to reduce our ecological impact by eliminating our mountainous production of wastes , attaining greater energy efficiency , eating lower on the food chain ( more vegetables , less meat ) , phasing out fossil fuels , driving our cars less and tightening our economic belts . <p> Any such program would seem to fly in the face of our government 's advice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here at some deep contradictions in our economic system . It 's time we gave full attention to ways of discouraging the kinds of consumption and production that are destroying the planet and encouraging the kinds that are environmentally benign . <p> The most heartening recent example of the latter was a discovery by Californian Ray Hunter of Hughes Aircraft , who found that ozone-destroying CFCs used as a cleaning fluid for electronic circuit boards can be replaced by a brew of citrus juices and water . Apply such common-sense ingenuity to other population-environment problems and the possibilities are endless . <p> CHART : <p> POPULATION LOSERS ARE WINNERS The good news is that many developing countries in recent years have enacted population programs that have sucessfully reduced average family size . The bad news is that their population will continue to grow , owing to lower death rates and an increase in the number of women of child-bearig age .
