<p> Having just built one new factory and expanded another , the Chrysler Corporation is cutting back on capital investment . AT &T; has also shaved its capital spending , but for a different reason : It purchased an existing phone network , rather than spending the money to build a new one . And Motorola Inc. , its sales hurt by the Asian crisis , is postponing investments in new factories and machinery , even going so far as to halt construction of a huge $3 billion semiconductor plant in Virginia . <p> Capital spending , a pillar of the nation 's strong economic growth over the last three years , is beginning to fade . First falling exports , then falling stock prices and now a slowdown in capital spending are chipping away at the vigorous economy , watering down growth in the second half of the year . Despite these hits , the economy appears to be strong enough to stay out of recession for now , thanks to robust consumer spending . <p> " The economy is not falling apart , " said David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a data gathering and forecasting service . " What you are seeing is some evidence of a weakening in capital spending , partly in response to Asia and partly because , in most industries , we have already added as many new facilities as we are likely to need for a while . " <p> Capital spending is the investment that companies and individuals make in the machinery , equipment and buildings to operate their businesses and make them more efficient . The cumulative result is a more vigorous and productive economy . In the 1990 's , robust capital spending has been a huge contributor to the economy 's overall growth , accounting for 25 percent of the total expansion in output in this decade  --  substantially more than in either the 1970 's or the 1980 's . <p> While the falloff in sales to Asia has played a significant role in discouraging capital spending , a bigger obstacle  --  one only partly a result of the Asian downturn  --  appears to be overcapacity . In interviews with officials at 15 corporations , many said that after having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were pausing while sales caught up . <p> Even without an outsized crisis like the one emanating from Asia , corporate America normally goes through cycles of robust capital spending followed by pullbacks . And more than seven years into the current economic expansion , this appears to be a time for pullback . <p> " Until we see that more demand is likely to occur , we are not going to go into another cycle of capacity expansion , " said Wynn Van Bussman , the chief economist at Chrysler , which recently completed a new engine factory in Detroit and expanded a transmission factory . " We do n't expect sales in North America to be higher in the next year or two than they already are this year . " <p> Like Chrysler , Levi Strauss &; Company worries about overcapacity . Even after closing 11 factories in the United States in recent months , the company still has the capacity to manufacture more jeans than it can sell in this country . So it is shifting money out of its capital spending budget and into marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will come close to doubling our advertising and promotion budget , " Clarence Grebey , a Levi Strauss spokesman , said , " and part of that is coming from capital expenditure . " <p> Capital spending at Motorola , the communications giant , has been curtailed because of a worldwide downturn in semiconductor sales and falling prices for these computer chips . The downturn is partly a result of recessions in Asia and partly a result of overcapacity domestically . <p> Whatever the balance of those reasons , Motorola 's $4.5 billion capital spending budget for this year , much of it earmarked for the United States , has been slashed to $2.9 billion . Nearly half the cutback involves semiconductor operations . Motorola announced on Wednesday that while construction continued at a huge semiconductor plant in Chandler , Ariz. , ground-breaking for another equally large one near Richmond , scheduled for next month , had been postponed  --  " until the market for semiconductors justifies new construction , " Scott Stevens , a Motorola spokesman , said yesterday . " Do I have any idea when that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the worst in semiconductor history . " <p> The incipient pullback in capital spending is developing rapidly . After having shot up at an annual rate of 16 percent from January through June , the growth rate for capital outlays will probably shrivel to 5 percent or 6 percent in the second half , some forecasters say . That would subtract at least one-quarter of a percentage point from the growth rate for the economy as a whole . Even without the hit from capital spending , economic growth is likely to be under 2 percent , as it was in the second quarter . During that quarter , falling exports and excessive stockpiles of unsold goods forced a variety of cutbacks in production . <p> Shrinking profits are also playing a role in corporate America 's decision to go easy on capital spending . And falling prices have had their impact , particularly in such industries as steel , copper , oil and agriculture . The Case Corporation , for example , announced last week that it was curtailing production of tractors and combines , which are capital expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling copper prices by cutting capital outlays to less than $180 million in the second half from $280 million in last year 's first half . <p> " The supply of copper and the demand for it are in pretty good balance , " Thomas M. Foster , a Phelps Dodge vice president , said . " But we have seen lower copper prices for some time , and they appear to be related to the perception that the Asian crisis will precipitate a worldwide slowdown . So we have not initiated new projects at any of our plants . " <p> In some cases , acquisitions have become a substitute for capital spending . AT &T; took this route . Rather than invest huge sums in local lines to connect business customers to AT &T's; long-distance network , the company in July acquired Teleport Communications Group , which already owns local networks in major cities . The acquisition was a factor in AT &T's; decision to hold capital spending to $7 billion this year , roughly the same as last year  --  after four years of rapidly rising investment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to create infrastructure , " said Eileen Connolly , an AT &T; spokeswoman . <p> Detailed economic data for the third quarter will not be available until next month , but various statistics are signaling the turn in capital spending . For example , spending on commercial construction , particularly factories but also office buildings , has begun to fall , the Commerce Department reports . Orders for nondefense capital goods , which are most of the equipment and machinery purchased by American companies , leveled off in the first half , after having risen sharply in 1996 and 1997 . And corporate America is operating its productive facilities within the United States at a relatively moderate 81.7 percent of full capacity , which is slightly below the long-term average . <p> The National Association of Purchasing Management , in a monthly survey of American manufacturers , found that capital spending projects currently in progress would take only 119 days on average to complete  --  down from 130 days last summer . The 119 days is the lowest level in the nearly 11 years that the association has compiled this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The association also surveys companies in the service sector . Although this survey lacks a specific question about capital spending , answers to questions that are included give the strong impression that service-sector companies are also cutting back . " Capital spending at service companies is certainly not increasing ; at best it is flat , " said Ralph Kaufman , a University of Houston management professor who runs the service-sector survey . <p> There are bright spots . Although Asian recessions have cut into Caterpillar Inc. ' s sales of earthmovers and construction equipment , the company says it is increasing capital spending anyway . " We are moving into new products , " said Douglas R. Oberhelman , Caterpillar 's chief financial officer , " including electric power generation from diesel engines and the manufacture of very small combines and tractors , which is a good business at the moment . " <p> Consumer spending , far and away the largest single outlay in the American economy , is still quite strong , and that helps to sustain capital investment , which in the second quarter reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consumer spending . Low interest rates have helped by encouraging store purchases on credit and home building . <p> Responding to brisk retail sales , Gap Inc. has set aside $700 million for capital spending this year , up from $450 million last year  --  earmarking most of the money for new Old Navy and Gap stores . Federated Department Stores Inc. is similarly engaged in store investment : $750 million a year over three years , but mainly to remodel existing stores , not to expand the total number . Hotel and theater construction is still robust , and so is investment in fast-food restaurants . <p> Wendy 's International Inc. , trying to catch up to the McDonald 's Corporation and Burger King , a unit of Diageo P.L.C. , says it will add 675 new restaurants next year , mostly in the United States , up from 550 openings this year . " Ever since we opened our first restaurant 30 years ago , experts have told us that the hamburger restaurant market is oversaturated , " Jack Lynch , a Wendy 's spokesman , said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States and 600 more abroad . An economic slowdown wo n't change our plans ; we do fine in a recession . " <p> Still , these are exceptions . The Eastman Chemical Company is more the rule . <p> When the Asian crisis struck , Eastman , which produces ingredients for the manufacture of plastics , paint and other coatings , was in the midst of an investment surge aimed at expansion . The spending is winding down now , more quickly than anticipated because of events in Asia , said Earnest J. Davenport Jr. , the chairman at Eastman . That is partly because foreign chemical companies are shipping products to the United States they can no longer sell in Asia , and that cuts into Eastman 's sales volume . <p> " We have delayed some planned capital spending projects in this country , " Mr. Davenport said , " and we may delay others .
