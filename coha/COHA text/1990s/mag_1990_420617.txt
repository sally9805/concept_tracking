Section : ONE FAMILY VACATION RENTING A SLICE OF PARADISE For as little as $500 a week , more and more Americans are enjoying the pleasures of a country home in Europe , Mexico or the Caribbean . <p> Unlike most of us , who merely fantasize about traveling to distant places , Sally and Bob Bloomgarden actually get up and go . Bali , Cozumel , Morocco , New Guinea  --  the couple 's itinerary in recent years reads like a Baedeker to adventure . But then the pull of family took over . The Bloomgardens began to miss their three children  --  twins Freya and Ingrid , now 12 , and Jenny , a  --  during their sojourns . " When we traveled halfway around the world , " observes Sally , 45 , a psychologist with a private practice near their home in Hilo , Hawaii , " we could n't even get the kids on the phone . " " Besides , " adds husband Bob , 48 , a psychiatrist also in private practice , " we wanted more family time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Italy 's Tuscan hills , the sound of children playing beside the pool drifts through the open doors along with the scent of sun-baked rosemary . The Bloomgardens are paying $2,180 a week to spend half a month in the three-bedroom , three-bath Villa Mimose , set amid olive groves about 10 kilometers from the 2,200-year-old walled city of Lucca ( pop . 91,000 ) . And the price covers more than the main house : the Bloomgardens also have a renovated hayloft just across the yard where 18-year-old babysitter Erika Hora stays with two of the kids . " We did n't want to give up travel or time with the children , " explains Bob . " Renting a villa lets us do both economically . " Indeed , the family probably would have spent about twice as much to stay in a luxury hotel or resort in the same region . <p> With savings like that as a lure , a growing number of Americans  --  with and without children  --  are adopting the Old World ! habit of renting a country house abroad for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in European rentals , for instance , has nearly tripled to more than 60 in the past two years , according to Michael and Laura Murphy , authors of A Traveler 's Guide to Vacation Rentals in Europe . And while no one keeps a tally of renters , the agencies report an upsurge in business : " Our bookings have risen at least 30% in each of the past three years , " says Michael Thiel of Hideaways International , an 11-year-old rental agency and travel club outside Boston . <p> The popularity is easy to explain . Although overseas air fare can take a big bite , the rents  --  which range from $500 to $2,000 a week for a party of four  --  are no steeper than at comparable retreats in American playgrounds like Cape Cod or the Napa Valley . Plus you get the exotic charge of going native for a while in such seductive places as the South of France , the Greek isle of Santorini or the Bahamas ( see the boxes on these pages for specifics ) . <p> In Italy 's Umbria or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are probably 10,000 or more rental properties , from rural Cabins to restored farmhouses and formal manor homes , " says Giovanni Giurlani of the Salogi Agency , a rental firm in Lucca . Italian developers have hopped on the bandwagon by buying up older houses and renovating them for rental . Prices peak during the high season of July and August but drop in the off-season . The Bloomgardens ' villa , for instance , rents for about 30% less in June and September and nearly 40% less during the rest of the year . " With the pool , " says Sally , " there are built-in-all-day activities for the kids . " <p> Still , what makes the trips flow so well is the Bloomgardens ' resourcefulness and spirit of adventure  --  essential ingredients for a vacation that plunges you into the daily life of a foreign land . " Art and architecture are not the main items on our agenda , " explains Bob . " What we like most is the cultural change and relaxation . Basically , we organize our lives around our travel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . Bob began planning in the fall of 1989 by requesting information from embassies and property-rental agencies , poring over directories and brochures and buying air tickets ( price : about $1,523 per person round trip ) through a travel discounter . The two villas he chose  --  the first in Umbria , where the Bloomgardens stayed for two weeks with another family before going on alone to Tuscany  --  were booked through RAVE ( Rent a Vacation Everywhere , 328 Main St , East , Suite 526 , Rochester , N.Y . 14604 ; 716-454-6440 ; fax 716-454-2616 ) . The rental logistics were simple , Bob says , " because every time Annette Waldman at RAVE said , Do n't worry , we 'll take care of it '  --  she actually did . " <p> The trick to successful booking , says Bob , is meticulous follow-through . " You ca n't take anything for granted , " he says . " You have to spell it out . And then you must check and double-check all tickets , reservations and other arrangements made for you by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plane from Hilo to Los Angeles , for example , Bob glanced at his claim stubs and noticed that one bag was n't checked through to New York , where the family planned to stay overnight before flying on . Armed with that information , he was able to pluck the errant suitcase from the baggage carousel in L.A.  --  thus avoiding the huge hassle of trying to find it later in New York . <p> But even if things do n't go right on the journey , there 's always the destination : " Thou paradise of exiles , Italy ! " as Percy Bysshe Shelley rhapsodized in 1819 . The Bloomgardens , for instance , were within an hour 's drive of Florence to the east and Pisa to the west . Think about it . You get up in the morning , sip that inimitable dark-roasted Italian brew , and decide whether to stroll the Ponte Vecchio across the Arno to see Michelangelo 's David or wander along the Campo dei Minicoli ( Square of Miracles ) to take in the Leaning Tower . Tough life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train and car to Rome , Pisa , Florence , Siena and more . But they also spent lots of time at the farmers ' market in the center of Lucca  --  which they found by asking locals where they shopped  --  stocking up on fresh chickens , cheese , pasta and vegetables at prices 50% below those in grocery stores After such shopping expeditions , they would often go back to the villa to cook , swim and just hang out . " Even when we traveled without the kids , " says Sally , " we preferred country-like , peaceful settings . " Hotels , at $150 to $300 a night for a double room , demand a more formal mood and wardrobe . And resorts , at $400 or more per couple per night , sometimes impose inflexible schedules for meals and activities-motto mention the need for tipping your way through each day . After a year of tightly structured 45-minute psychotherapy sessions tilling 14-hour workdays ( Sally admits to skipping both breakfast and lunch ) , the Bloomgardens are starved for free-floating time . " The kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the nature of our work makes us grouchy . We 're often on edge . " So for a vacation , the family relishes the joy of relaxing together . " The trips say to the kids and to each other , We care about you , ' " explains Bob . Sally sums it up : " During these trips , we get close again . We get the family back together . " WHAT IT COST <p> Here is what the six members of the Bloomgarden party spent during an average week of their four-week vacation this year in Italy . The rental is for the Villa Mimose in high season , though other fine family-size villas can be had for as little as $500 a week . TABLE <p> MAP : With about 85% of all villa rentals in Italy  --  and some of the best landscape and linguine too  --  the Tuscany and Umbria regions ( shown on the map ) draw Europeans and Americans alike . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : At left , Bob Bloomgarden of Hilo , Hawaii plays with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their villa near the ancient city of Lucca ( far left ) . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : " We prefer to eat out at lunchtime , " says Bob , dining above at the Ristorante sergio in lucca with ( clockwise ) wife Sally , Jenny , twins Ingrid and Freya and babysitter Erika Hora .

Box 261 , Westwood , Mass. 02090 ; 617-329-4680 ) is one of the few agencies that handle rental properties in Ireland . <p> The French Experience ( 370 Lexington Ave. , New York , N.Y . 10017 ; 212-986-1115 ) is the only U.S. agency that books the 30,000 gites  --  rustic cottages-that pepper rural France . <p> Heritage of England ( P.O. Box 297 , Falls Village , Conn. 06031 ; 800-533-5405 ) handles cottages throughout England , Scotland and Wales . <p> Hideaways International ( P.O. Box 1464 , Littleton , Mass. 01460 ; 800-843-4433 ) is an agency and travel club  --  annual membership : $75-with 2,000 rentals worldwide . <p> Twelve Islands &; Beyond ( 5431 MacArthur Blvd . N.W. , Washington , D.C. 20016 ; 800-345-8236 ) has rentals on the Greek islands . <p> Vacanza Bella ( 2443 Fillmore St. , Suite 228 , San Francisco , Calif. 94115 ; 415-821-9345 ) rents Italian properties , including unusual farmhouses in southern Tuscany . <p> Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rentals in Europe by Michael and Laura Murphy ( Dutton , $11.95 ) describes 64 North American-based rental agencies and offers valuable tips . For example , bring lots of 50-pence coins when you stay in some British cottages : you have to feed them into a meter to get electricity . World-Wide Home Rental Guide ( P.O. Box 2842 , Sante Fe , N.M . 87504 ; 505-988-5188 ) , a biennial directory at $18 a year , carries paid ads for villas from an $18-a-night cottage on Greece 's Santorini Island to a $140,000-a-week Hawaiian estate . <p> Pick your spot . Most villas ( by which we mean freestanding , single-family country houses that you can rent ) outside the U.S. are in Europe , Mexico and the Caribbean , with the most popular summer rentals in Italy and France . For the best deals in 1991 , though , consider Portugal 's south coast , the Algarve , where a three-bedroom seaside villa with pool and maid service costs about $2,100 to $2,800 a week in peak season . Other inexpensive houses can be had in Jamaica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chalet for six would cost as little as $840 a week in January in the Vorarlberg province , for example  --  less than half what you might pay in the more trendy province of Arlberg . <p> If you fancy a fully staffed villa ( cook , housekeeper , maid service and so on ) , focus on Mexico and the Caribbean , where labor costs are cheap ( from $15 to $25 a day for a cook in St. Lucia , for example ) . <p> Time your visit . High season in Mexico and the Caribbean is Dec. 15 through April 15 . In Europe ( excluding ski resorts ) , it 's generally June through September , with July and August the busiest months . But for value consider the off-season , when you can save 20% to 50% on rent and avoid crowds too . " Most places are just as beautiful in April and October , " says Howard Isaacs , editor of Italian Traveler newsletter ( P.O. Box 32 , Livingston , N.J. 07039 ; 201-535-6572 ; $52 for 12 issues a year ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine months before you want to go . " Most of the best villas in the Algarve are booked by November for the following summer , " notes Claire Packman of At Home Abroad , a rental agency in New York City . Nearly all European villas require that you book a minimum of two to four weeks in peak season ; those in Mexico and the Caribbean usually require one week . Also , most U.S. agencies ask you to pay 30% to 60% of the rental cost when you first sign up , and the balance a month or two before you depart . But do n't grumble . If the dollar is falling , as it has this year , you might come out ahead by paying earlier when the exchange rate is more favorable . <p> Find a reputable , energetic agent . Interview several , asking such questions as : How long have you been in business ? How recently have you inspected the properties you recommend ? Do you have recent color photos of the house ? Is it on the beach/close to town/near a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , phone service , linens and the like included ? Are there any servants ? And " the most crucial question : Is there knowledgeable English-speaking management nearby in case of problems ? " adds Peter Collard , editor of the Villa Report newsletter ( P.O. Box 4960 , Greenwich , Conn. 06830 ; 203-454-2100 ; $65 a year for six issues ) . Also , do n't take working telephones for granted . Ask . <p> Close the deal . Some agents require a refundable damage deposit of up to 25% in advance , above the rental fee , plus a registration or administration fee , and fees for " extras " like maid service , bed linens and other amenities . In France , for example , where bedding often is not supplied , linens will cost an additional $25 or so a week per bed . Still , " never send an agent any money until he or she has confirmed all verbal promises in writing , " warns Collard . Those promises should include the rental rate , a description of the villa with photograph and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel . You might also want to take out cancellation insurance , such as the policy offered by Travel Guard ( 800-826-1300 ) . It costs from 4.5% to 5.5% of your villa rental and covers cancellations owing to injury , sickness or death of any family member and certain other emergencies  --  such as if a hurricane blows the roof off your idyllic , palm-shaded Caribbean retreat . <p> By Mary Granfield and Elizabeth Fenner <p> BY JOANNA L.
