Section : WORLDS IN CONTACT The Caribbean is haunted by the ghosts of Christmas past <p> The village of Gingerland is strung out along a couple of roads on the small Caribbean island of Nevis . The main route around the island passes through the village , another heads down to the sea , and a third turns inland toward the island 's 3,000-foot-tall volcanic cone . The dominant buildings are two stone churches ; near the village center , a bridge crosses a ravine , filled with breadfruit and papaya trees , and small shops line the road . Some inhabitants of Gingerland 's large cemetery lived and died when Nevis was the center of Britain 's New World empire and the North American colonies were but the troublesome and unprofitable periphery . A few hundred people , more or less , live in the village , depending on where you draw its boundaries , But at Christmas , people from all over Nevis and the surrounding islands come here to see the masquerade . <p> The " captain "  --  an older man well known in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancers through the village . These men wear colorful shirts and trousers , or sometimes skirts , on which small mirrors and bells have been sewn . Trailing ribbons decorated with more flashing mirrors and tinkling bells , they dance to the rhythm of two drums ( a deep kettledrum and a deeper bass ) and a simple wood or tin fife . <p> Other groups of dancers wear far more elaborate costumes , with crowns of peacock feathers and striking gowns . Still others are dressed in parodies of European clothes of another era and masks of wire mesh painted a startling pink . Some athletic dancers wear minimal costumes and carry bows and arrows ; as they dance wildly , the most adept throw tomahawks into the air and catch them without looking . The devilish protagonist of the island 's popular " bull play " may appear , dressed in a red suit and fierce mask with bull 's horns attached . <p> At first the music sounds like a military march , but the fife has an exaggerated and somewhat satirical air . The music shifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beat accelerates , men and women dance a hot rumba , very close to each other but not touching . At each change the music stops abruptly , freezing the dancers in their steps . Here is the cast of Nevis 's historical drama over the last five centuries  --  people whose ancestors were from Africa , Europe , and the New World itself . The masquerade features them all , and the music and dance tell stories of the ways they interacted . <p> Because of the holiday season , December is the time of year when stories of the past seem to have special importance . In North America , as elsewhere , to celebrate Christmas , trees are forced through living room doors and loaded down with an anthropologist 's dream of symbolic ornaments-birds , donkeys , candies , stars , and sleighs with fat , bearded gentlemen in strange red suits . Mistletoe is hung and rings of ornamented foliage are placed on doors . To celebrate Hanukkah , the candies of the menorah are lighted one by one and the dreidel is spun . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , although sometimes the traditions that give meaning to the customs are nearly lost from everyone 's memory . ( Who was King Wenceslaus , anyway ? And what 's a dreidel ? ) <p> In the Caribbean , traditions are different from island to island , and Gingerland 's masquerade is just one of many observances . In 1774 , Edward Long described a Jamaican masquerade featuring an important character called John Canoe : <p> In the towns , during Christmas holidays , they have several tall robust fellows dressed up in grotesque habits , and a pair of oxhorns on their head , sprouting from the top of a horrid sort of visor , or mask , which about the mouth is rendered very terrific with large boar-tusks . The masquerader , carrying a woddin sword in his hand , is followed with a numerous crowd of drunken women , who refresh him frequently with a cup of aniseed-water , whilst he dances at every door , bellowing out John Connu ! with great vehemence The History of Jamaica . <p> Who is John Canoe ? Edward Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with the Prussians in the slave trade ( " Conny " is a corruption of the German Konig , or " king " ) . In 1816 , however , " Monk " Lewis described John Canoe in less fearsome terms , " dressed in a striped doublet , and bearing upon his head a kind of pasteboard house-boat , filled with puppets , representing , some sailors , other soldiers , others again slaves at work on a plantation , &c"; ( Journal of a West India Proprietor ) . Perhaps the dancer and his headpiece represented the slave trade itself , with soldiers and sailors taking Africans into bondage . Some speculate instead that the character of John Canoe was modeled after Noah , who saved humankind from the Old Testament deluge . <p> Another amateur historian , I.M. Belisario , writing in 1837 , says that the name John Canoe is a corruption of the French gens inconnus ( unknown folks ) and refers to the movement of French speakers from Haiti to Jamaica in 1795 . Some elements from Haiti did indeed enter the festivities after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canoe celebrations in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries , was the parade of " set-girls , " groups of young women who dressed in elaborate formal gowns , " pin for pin alike , and carried umbrellas or parasols of the same color and size , held over their nice showy , well-put-on toques " ( Tom Cringle 's Log , 1836 ) . <p> There is an older John Canoe , however . In Jamaica Talk ( 1961 ) , linguist Frederic Cassidy argues that the name is what is important , and that the boat ( like many parts of the performance ) was added later . In the West African language Ewe , which is spoken today in Nigeria and is related to several West Coast languages , dzhon means a sorcerer or magician and kunu means something terrible that can cause death . The combined form , dzhonko-nu , means a powerful and dangerous shaman . In Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean , and in most of the rest of the African American New World , such a person is now generally called an Obeah-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions to Jamaican culture . To cite just one other example , the most popular Jamaican folk tales are stories of Anancy , the trickster spider ; they deal with the same plots and themes as the stories of West Africa 's anansesem ( spider stories ) , sometimes mirroring them nearly word for word . The similarities are remarkable , considering that the ancestors of those now living in Africa and the New World parted company in Thomas Jefferson 's time or before . <p> Jamaican stories and performances rework African themes and weave them together with elements of Judeo-Christian , Native American , and even classical traditions . " Monk " Lewis , in his journal for 1815 , records a John Canoe celebration in which the figures on parade included Britannia carrying a trident and the coat of arms of Great Britain ( portrayed by a horribly embarrassed young woman ) , the king and queen , Admiral Lord Nelson , and British mummers . The Yoruba god Ogun , patron of smiths and metalworking , may appear in the form of ( or sometimes alongside ) Saint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have proved popular over the years include Nanny and Cudjoe , revered leaders of Jamaican maroons ( blacks who escaped slavery and set up free communities in the mountains ) , as well as General Jackson , who brutally put down a rebellion in 1865 . <p> So who is John Canoe  --  an African king in league with Prussians , a biblical Noah , a leader of Haitian " unknown folk , " a West African Obeah-man , or some other , unidentified personality ? The only answer that is accurate and faithful to John Canoe 's complicated origins is that he is a Jamaican . The Jamaican tradition of John Canoe combines all the contributing sources . <p> Such fusions are found in all Caribbean holiday pageants . Recent Christmas plays on Nevis have featured , among many others , David and Goliath , Saint George and the dragon , Mussolini and Haile Selassie , Ferdinand and Isabella , Moses and the children of Israel , mummies , and a multifaceted character named the Black Prince of Palestine . <p> Times change and cultures change with them ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves are becoming less popular : Gingerland 's Christmas fame has declined greatly in the last generation . In Christmas Sports in St. Kitts-Nevis ( 1984 ) , Kittitian-born Frank Mills says , " The overwhelming majority of Kittitians and Nevisians under thirty years of age have never heard of half the different kinds of sports mentioned , and have witnessed even fewer . And there are many nationals over fifty who can add perhaps another dozen to the eight I have described . " <p> John Canoe too is becoming a forgotten figure . Even in the early 1800s , the John Canoe dance in Jamaica was coming under pressure to change . The Reverend R. Bickell , an abolitionist , said that " most of those who had become Christians were ashamed to join in it " ( The West Indies As They Are ; or A Real Picture of Slavery , 1825 ) . This adds weight to the interpretation that , at least in part , John Canoe voiced a people 's resistance to an inhumane system and signaled their allegiance to an African past at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves most freely . The powerful and disturbing John Canoe became less important at about the time of the abolition of slavery in the British colonies in 1834 . Once the centerpiece of the celebration , he became the headliner for an increasingly diverse performance , then a member of the cast , and eventually a character whose story few can remember in any detail . <p> In 1951 there was an attempt to revive the John Canoe dance with all its characters , and again dissension was voiced . One letter to the editor of Jamaica 's Daily Gleaner said that " Juncunoo " was obscene , and " many people were taken to court for dancing horse-head , it was so vulgar . " We need not lament the passing of this tradition , however . More than likely , the spirit of John Canoe  --  woven in new ways into the constantly changing West Indian traditions  --  has been so transformed that despite his presence we no longer recognize him . <p> PHOTO : A reveler , costumed as a lionfish , dances in a New Year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Viesti ; Viesti Associates , Inc . ) <p> PHOTO : In Nassau , elaborately costumed groups compete for prizes .
