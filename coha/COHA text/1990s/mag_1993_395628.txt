African-American comics have always poked fun at our foibles  --  sparing no expense to deliver that's-our-people punch lines . In fact , one of our first widely acclaimed funny ladies  --  character actress Hattie McDaniel of Gone With the Wind fame  --  summed up our outstanding comic ability to work with societal restraints with her poignant quip : " I can either play a maid for $200 or be a real one for $2 ! " Fortunately , today 's Black comediennes no longer need to submerge their humor in sassy , subservient posturing to get a laugh . But they 're still telling it like it is  --  and then some . In the past year , a fresh-from-the-'hood batch of stand-up comics have gotten cast on major network television shows . Explains comedienne  --  actress Phyllis Stickney , who parlayed her razor-sharp womanist stand-up talents into small but memorable film roles in The Women of Brewster Place , Jungle Fever and What 's Love Got to Do With It , " Never before have so many of us been given a culturally sensitive arena in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like Kim Coles and Kim Wayans , offer PG-rated punch lines . Some of the New Jack comics , like Adele Givens , however , promote humor that borders on cutting  --  almost bleeding  --  edge . Some African-Americans feel some of these comics ' shockingly lewd language is demoralizing and degrading  --  especially to women . Other fans revel in its rawness but secretly question if they , too , have n't fallen prey to the low self-esteem that eats away at much of the Black community . Still others , like In Living Color 's David Alan Grier , insist that New Jack comedy is n't really new . " We 've always had raw humor in the Black community  --  from Redd to Richard to Eddie . It 's just never been put on television before . It 's also never been done by women . " What can not be disputed , however , is the underrated ( and underrepresented ) status that Black comediennes have had in the traditionally male-dominated business of comedy . Screamingly funny sisters such as Jackie " Moms " Mabley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ props that their male counterparts have . Nonetheless , they have laid the foundation for our modern-day comediennes . In that spirit , we bring you five of today 's funny ladies because , as Phyllis Stickney says , " It 's time for us to press on  --  and I do n't mean Lee nails ! " KIM COLES HEH MON , LET 'S HEAR IT FOR " MY GIRL " Best remembered for her short stint ( and sweetness ) on In Living Color , Kim Coles added one part spice and two parts sugar as a member of the Caribbean " Heh Mon " Hedley family . This fall , the comedienne costars opposite not one , not two , but three funny ladies ( Queen Latifah , Kim Fields , Erika Alexander ) in Fox-TV 's sitcom My Girls  --  an urbanized , flavorized and anything but homogenized sitcom a la Designing Women . Coles , who hails from Brooklyn and now resides in Los Angeles , makes no bones about the fact that her humor is " squeaky-clean . " A G-rated yet foot-stompin " funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted her on It 's Showtime at the Apollo and snapped her up as the opening act for his national tour . It was by watching Sinbad in action , Coles says , that she was influenced to tell little truths about Black life and keep her humor raunch-free . " Anybody can do jokes about roaches , Jehovah 's Witnesses , weaves and " getting some , ' ' " she explains , " but what can they do beyond that ? " Coles 's passion for comedy was born out of a need to perform : " I could n't act , dance or sing but I needed to express myself artistically . " Now , she says , she 's into comedy for the long haul . " Doing stand-up comedy is my bread and butter . I 'll be doing it till I 'm 80 ! " When Coles first started , however , Kevin and Andre Brown 's famed Uptown Comedy Club in Harlem had n't opened its doors yet . " Black comedians on the East Coast were at the mercy of White club owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the one or two token Black comics of the evening then . " Kevin Brown remembers those days well . " Kim and the other comedians really had to pay their dues to get recognition . Now , with all of these avenues open for Black comics , you have this new breed of New Jack comics who have been doing stand-up for six months and say , " Oh , I can do a weave joke , now give me a movie ! ' But Kim has what it takes to make it  --  charm , wit , intelligence and talent . " As for the well-hyped New Jack humor that 's hot now , Coles says , " There 's nothing wrong with so-called blue humor , as long as there is room for red , purple and cocoa humor too . After all , as a race we are a colorful bunch of people ! " KIM WAYANS LIVING AND LEARNING Fur flew all over Hollywood early in 1993 when Keenan Ivory Wayans , the creator of In Living Color , and his brother Damon ran into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced Middle America to nineties-styled Black comedy . Not long after , the show 's producers filed an arbitration suit against the dynamic duo 's sister , Kim Wayans . She was eventually suspended from In Living Color because , she says , " they claimed that I was uncooperative when I refused to perform a skit I believed to be offensive . " Although zip-lipped on the particulars of the behind-the-scenes " ka-flamma and drama , " the comedienne , best known for her gossipy character Benita Buttrell , has plenty to say about the show 's demise . " What was so unique about the show was that it was from an African-American perspective . It 's okay for us to send up stereotypes of our people  --  but it is not the right of other people . " Wayans culled Benita and all her other comedic skits from memories of growing up in Manhattan 's colorful Chelsea section . One among a talented brood of ten children  --  five boys and five girls  --  Wayans says that humor was the glue that held the family together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughter in that apartment ! " As for on-screen role models , she says , " I was too young to remember " Moms " Mabley . So who could I try to be like  --  Aunt Esther ? " LaWanda Page 's character from Sanford and Son . These days Wayans faces a different obstacle . " Hollywood is so fascinated with Black street life , " she gripes . " There is so much more to Black life than what we see portrayed . " Wayans says she is so convinced that Hollywood will eventually embrace other aspects of Black life that she is currently working on a concept for her own show . Knowing Hollywood 's " trickle-down theory " all too well , however , she 's hush-hush on the specifics . With a mischievous smile she confides , " I ca n't tell you what it 's about yet , or the next thing you know , Julia Roberts will be doing it ! " ADELE GIVENS A " DEF " LADY The outspoken female contingency of HBO 's Russell Simmons 's Def Comedy Jam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the in-your-face home-girl . Def comediennes like Chicago native Adele Givens make the bravado of their close counterparts  --  female rappers  --  seem as lightweight as a puff on a nicotine-free cigarette . To get the full flavor of today 's B-girl grit , you have to see this ex-Social Security clerk in action . Warning : Those outside the New Jack comedy arena may be horrified by the idea of a sister using language littered with four-letter words . But according to Givens , " My stuff reflects the environment that I grew up in  --  namely , the ghetto . " Even this R-rated sister predicts that the current four-letter tirade may soon run its course : " I 've always been loud and probably always will be , but I 'm not a mother , and I know if I had children I would n't want them to hear me talk like this ! " It was Givens 's ability to talk like the guys , however , that won her an audition and eventually a slot on Simmons 's red-hot show , which is hosted by Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying bye-bye to my day job ! " ) was the notion of having a forum : " There is so much dysfunction in our community that gets swept under the rug . We need to talk about this s  --  ! " And talk she does . About everything from sexual discrimination to abusive relationships ( " I 've been in too many " ) is fair game for Givens 's material . Remembering yet another affair that went awry , she brainstorms a new idea . " Women around the globe should say to men , " Look , we 're not having any more babies until you act right . If you want to act the fool , we 'll end mankind . ' That 's what we should do , use the power that we do have ! " Pondering her latest revelations , Givens begins to scribble furiously on a napkin , realizing that she has created  --  yet again  --  the makings of some hilarious yet provocative material . " Hmmm , " she says , all smiles , " that 'll work ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ellen Cleghorne is thrilled to be one of the chosen few Black comediennes on a crossover-comedy vehicle . But this sister still sees her Saturday Night Live gig merely as a stepping stone . And for good reason . While the skit-witty show jump-started raw-and-ready Eddie Murphy 's career , as a Black female featured performer Cleghorne finds herself having to fight for her own spotlight . " It 's a real catch-22 situation , " the Brooklyn native explains during a break before a recent live taping . " I tell them , " Give us more airtime , and more Blacks will watch the show . ' They 're like , " If more Black people watched the show , we 'd write more skits for you ! ' ' " Luckily , the skilled funny lady knows how to make her moments memorable . As fellow cast member Chris Rock points out , " She has the most expressive eyes and theatrical presence onstage . " She also has fierce one-liner timing and a " spookproof " Spanish accent , which she utilizes flamboyantly in her recurring character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit , Cleghorne is also a first-rate writer who turns out her own skits  --  both on the show and on the stand-up circuit where she really gets to show off . " Even if the stand-up audience is mixed , they still get the Black thing , " she explains . " You do n't have the obstacles of producers and writers who , let 's face it , are n't interested in hearing about nappy hair ! " Explains Cleghorne , " Look , I can do the homegirl thang as well as anybody without being vulgar . " Cleghorne happily gives kudos " to one of the few Black comediennes whose name goes above the title of a Hollywood movie on the marquee " : Whoopi Goldberg . " I 'll know I 've arrived when Hollywood studio execs in a meeting say , " Look , we ca n't afford Whoopi on this one  --  let 's get Ellen Cleghorne instead ! ' ' " FOWLER : UPTOWN ON SATURDAY NIGHT Ronda Fowler , who stars on the nationally syndicated Uptown Comedy Club , understands firsthand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial " way loud . For one thing , she explains , " Black-male comedians have always channeled their anger into humor  --  often at our expense . Now that the gender roles are shifting slightly , men have become the butt of our jokes and they 're not having it ! " But what is the gauge on how far to go ? Fowler feels it 's the audience . She learned this when she first started doing stand-up at the Uptown Comedy Club in Harlem four years ago : " I was dissing men to the point where the audience would n't even laugh anymore ! " Uptown 's management , however , continued to support her . " They would n't have tolerated this in a White club . " However , like many of today 's Black comics who 've traveled the road from stand-up to the " little screen , " Fowler knows the restraints of network censorship all too well . During its first season , episodes of Uptown were yanked off the air at the last minute without explanation . " You would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains . " Any material that can be interpreted as stereotypical by other racial groups is overscrutinized . " But the censors are n't the only ones on PC patrol . Non-Black viewers also " air " their grievances about Uptown 's humor . Case in point : Fowler 's recurring character , Teta Maria , the host of a Latin cooking show . " You would n't believe how many people sent letters and called to complain about that one skit , " she recalls , laughing . " I grew up on New York 's Lower East Side where there were a lot of sexy Latin women who loved to cook , so I did n't think it was a slur . The good part is , it taught me to be culturally sensitive to Latins . They hate being stereo-typed as much as we do . " But , regaining her resolve , she adds quickly , " Thank God there 's stand-up , so we can go and really speak our minds . Women are different now , you know . We 're not all about getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't make any broad assumptions about us anymore ! " Nor does it seem that anyone will get away with trying to . In the comedy chain of evolution , our voices deliver the truth . And yes , our fresh queens of comedy intend to forge ahead on tough terrain that has never been broken ( or spoken ) before  --  salving our wounds with healing humor , altering attitudes distilled in the dark ages and , most of all , passing on the punch lines for generations of female funnymeisters to carry on ! Deborah Gregory , a contributing writer for ESSENCE , has been known to tell a few jokes herself . <p>
