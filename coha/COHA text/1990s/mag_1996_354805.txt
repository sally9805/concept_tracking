STALIN 'S DINNERS IN THE KREMLIN went on all night . he would sit at a long table and force his ministers and cronies to drink , hour after hour , while he plotted and probed and flattered and terrified them . At dawn , when their brains were numb with fear and vodka and confusion , the NKVD might lead one or two of the men away , without explanation , to be shot . That was the physics of paranoia under laboratory conditions : for every action , an opposite ( if , in the Kremlin , somewhat unequal ) reaction . Paranoia induces paranoia . Stalin refracted violent fear through alcohol , then presided over a reciprocal mind game that ended in death . <P> Intellectuals sometimes take a certain ain't-we-awful pride in America 's tradition of political paranoia ( Know-Nothingism , anti-Catholic ravings , McCarthyism , for example ) . But on the whole , Americans ' freedom has made them comparative innocents ; dinner parties aside , Stalin may have murdered upwards of 10 million of his fellow citizens , though estimates vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the past year or have seen a surge in the dark dynamic : Waco and Ruby Ridge , then Oklahoma City , a commemoration of April 19 , which has become a savage Guy Fawkes Day . Five days after Oklahoma City , the Unabomber struck in Sacramento , California , as if envious and eager to reclaim the attention . The paranoid screams self-importance ; insignificance transforms itself into destructive power . <P> The air filled with rhetoric about " angry white males , " with middle-aged militiamen in weekend camouflage promising armed struggle against Washington . The National Rifle Association complained about the government 's " jackbooted thugs . " The assault-rifle fringe could hear black helicopters descending , as if to deliver Boutros Boutros-Ghali , dark men in blue helmets and World Government . <P> A hundred paranoias bloomed . Or anyway , moods hardened into intransigence : Here I stand . The Gingrich freshmen vowed no compromise ; liberals wrote them down as fascists . The Million Man March , otherwise admirable , provided the platform for minister Louis Farrakhan 's elaborate numerological fantasies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whitewater and Vincent Foster 's death continued to emit a low-intensity radioactive glow ( a marvelously double-jointed paranoid bumper sticker said IF VINCE FOSTER HAD OWNED A GUN , HE WOULD BE ALIVE TODAY ) . And , of course , an elaborate police conspiracy framed O.J. Simpson for a double murder . <P> By last week it was clear the American psychology has changed , much for the better . Certain menacing uncertainties have resolved themselves . <P> The man who seems to be the Unabomber was arrested  --  another example of the way in which a demon , hitherto concealed , may shrivel when brought into sunlight . The suspect 's family turned him in because they recognized his writings  --  a killer betrayed by his own prose style . <P> The Alfred P. Murrah Building in Oklahoma City was leveled last April . The victims and their families have come at least some way toward healing . President Clinton visited in his role as national grief counselor .
