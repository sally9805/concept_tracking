// HOW CAN I CORNER FASTER ? I can keep up with my buds on climbs , flats , even when it gets a little hairy in the group . But I get blown right out the back on every turn . What can I do ? Lance Armstrong : Most pros rely on their tires and press their bikes into the corner . You can really push a tire these days . Keep your body upright and push the bike down . When I won the world championship in Norway in 1993 , was cornering hard in the wettest race of my life . It was so wet it 's stuck in the minds of a lot of racers . Everyone talks about it . Chris Carmichael : You can corner faster if you lean your bike and keep your body perpendicular to the ground . Notice that Lance 's weight is on the outside pedal . Notice also that he 's ready for braking , but not using the brakes . Brake before the corner , not during it . QUICK TURNS 1 . Go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a sense for leaning your bike way over . 2 . Next , find a vacant area like a housing development or industrial park where you can vary your speed . Do the same corner over and over , each time a little faster . 3 . Experiment with different lines and lean angles as well as speeds . What 's your climbing secret ? YOU ALWAYS SEEMED TO STRUGGLE IN THE ALPS AND PYRENEES BUT YOU RULED THIS YEAR ! Photograph // Lance : I 'm unorthodox . I 'll do whatever I need to get over the top with the leaders . That usually means getting out of the saddle . A lot of guys stay in the saddle because it 's more comfortable . But standing is more natural for me , especially when it 's intense or I have to make a big effort . Also , remember to use other riders . If the important riders are with you , you know they 're going to make the effort to get back to the leaders . Use them to draft . Carmichael : Energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Lance 's butt in the saddle . But he 's powerful . When you climb out of the saddle , rock the bike and keep your body straight . As the pedal drops , your body weight should be over it . You can see it in this picture-the right leg is up but it 's coming around to drive down . The bike will move to his left and his body weight will fall on the right pedal . THE #1 WAY TO CLIMB STRONGER Eliminate the weakest spot in your out-of-the  --  saddle pedal stroke-the bottom . As your foot reaches its lowest point , think about trying to " scoop " it down and up . This prevents your foot from just dropping as dead weight If you 're doing it right , you 'll feel as if you 're running on the pedals . I 'm lighter than everyone I ride with . Maybe coincidentally , I just ca n't descend with those guys . There 's got to be something I can do besides getting fatter , right ? Lance : Descending is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a skill . Sean Kelly won Milan-San Remo because of his descending , and Moreno Argentin lost the same race because he could n't descend . My former Motorola teammate Sean Yates was the best . He would n't even touch his brakes . ( One thing that helped him was that he used to ride motorcycles a lot . ) Do n't concentrate on getting to the bottom with everyone else . Concentrate on getting down first Yates always said he could pick up the most time in the corners . Brake before the corner , then accelerate out of it . I 'll do an aerodynamic tuck if I 'm solo , but if you 're in a group you do n't need to . Carmichael : Anticipate what 's coming and let your instincts handle what 's right in front of you . When you 're bombing down a hill and you 're in the middle of the comer , you should already be looking to the next one . Mentally , keep putting yourself farther and farther down the road because things start to come at you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rolling thunder . Can you help ? Lance : My sprinting used to be terrible but I 've gotten faster . Mostly I worked on field position . Know who is the fastest . Do n't waste energy going into it and be blown for the sprint . Find the right wheel and get there with as little effort as possible . If you 're at the front for the last 2 kilometers , you 'll be dusted . Timing the jump is instinct . You have to take the conditions into consideration . If it 's uphill or windy , you want to wait longer before you jump . 3 TIME TRIAL TIPS 1 . Do n't look down . There 's little aero advantage ( helmets are designed to slice wind when your face is forward ) and much danger . Photograph // 2 . Learn to maintain form when you 're blown . This can save precious seconds right at the end . You do n't necessarily want to deliberately bonk so you can practice form , but when you get caught feeling weak , take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak foot . It should be poised between the 10 and 11 o'clock positions for the first downstroke . Why not strongest foot first ? You start snappier if your strong foot comes around for the second stroke on the already moving drivetrain . GOT ANY TIPS ON TIME TRIALING ? Lance : One of the keys is to stay low . If I need to stretch my back on an uphill I might stand , but that 's it . You can use a speedometer and a heart-rate monitor , but I think the speedometer is deceptive . In your mind you might want to go at least 50 kph , but that might not be possible . The monitor is better . Carmichael : One of the main things Lance had to develop was the sense of the enemy around him . He 's always used other people as a big stimulus , but in a time trial they are n't there . You ca n't see them . It 's a different psychology . Lance had to learn to race against himself . Also , you need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notice how the first interval in a set is always the most painful ? It 's the same in a time trial . The body has to start the process of clearing during the warmup . I have about the same form I usually do but early this season I won a local race-something I 'd never done before . Then I bagged another one . My friends are teasing me about EPO . I 'm trying to tell them that winning makes you win more . Get them off my back . Lance : Winning is the most overlooked thing . People shoot for the ordinary , not the extraordinary . That feeling-the finish line , the last couple of meters-if I could bottle that up and sell it I 'd be the richest man in the world . This is n't bragging , it 's an obvious fact : I 'm the strongest rider in my group . How can I turn that into leadership ? Lance : Get yourself super-motivated . I say things in races to psyche my teammates up . I might predict , " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That kind of confidence boosts morale if you 're saying it within the team or among friends . But you have to come through . If you sacrifice for them , they 'll work hard for you . Sidebar When you bunnyhop , think " forward " as well as up . " Do n't downshift too soon on a climb . Spin your current gear until you feel you wo n't be able to hold it for 10 more rpm , then downshift . If you go sooner , you waste momentum , making the hill feel longer and harder . Sidebar The smoothest path is n't always best for a mountain biker . Look for a line that puts you in the most rideable spot 15 feet up the trail . Keep your weight neutral-over the bottom bracket-between technical moves when riding off-road . To ease muscle during long , hard pedaling , " float " each leg every three or four strokes  --  let your foot fall without exerting force . Sidebar Loft your front wheel off drops higher than 6 inches . This smooths your landing because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the trail . Try to miss everything and you miss nothing . Roll over little stuff and forget about it . To stop bike shimmy on descends , accelerate or decelarate to a different speed . Does n't work ? Clamp the top tube with your knees . Sidebar A safe bail on the trail : Jump off the back of your bike and hit the ground running . Develop bike-handling skills by playing slow  --  speed tag or derby ( trying to knock your friends over ) on a grassy field . Be gentle . Also ; Ride the length of the field leaning into each another ; pick up sticks without dismounting ; and purposely touch wheels . // <p>
