<p> Secretary Shalala kicked off the " Healthy Child Care America " campaign at the National Child Care Health Forum on May 10 , 1995 in Washington , D.C. This ground breaking event brought together over 180 health and child care professionals from around the country to discuss health and safety practices and issues and to launch a nationwide initiative to promote the health and safety of children and families . <p> The National Child Care Health Forum and Healthy Child Care Campaign are collaborative efforts sponsored by the Administration on Children , Youth and Families ' Child Care Bureau and the Health Resources and Services Administration 's Maternal and Child Health Bureau . Both agencies are located within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and are committed to improving the health and safety of children and families . <p> What is the Healthy Child Care America campaign ? It 's child care and health care professionals joining efforts to ensure that children are cared for in safe and healthy environments . It 's child care and health care professionals working together to raise the awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary Shalala stated , the campaign is about " involving more Americans in the crusade to improve the quality and availability of child care " . <p> This campaign is formed on the principle that child care settings offer unique opportunities to promote the healthy development of young children . Linking health care with child care makes good sense for maximizing resources , for developing comprehensive and coordinated services , and most important , for nurturing children . <p> The Health Forum really set the tone for launching the Healthy Child Care Campaign . The Forum provided an excellent opportunity for child care and health care professionals to network and plan strategies to foster the health and safety of children and families . The eagerness and willingness to become involved was evident as child and health care professionals drew upon their expertise to draft the " Blueprint for Action " , a guide that States and communities can use to plan and build linkages to launch local child care campaigns . This " Blueprint " identifies areas such as increasing the immunization coverage for children in child care , strengthening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care providers . <p> Secretary Shalala reminded the audience of how precious children are - and that we must do all we can to establish safe , healthy , wholesome environments for them . For many families , child care is the " new neighborhood " where more and more children spend a part of their day . The Secretary affirmed the Administration 's commitment to this " new neighborhood "  --  a vision that takes a two-generational approach and responds to the needs of both parents and children . This is child care that helps educate children , that helps promote children 's health , and helps parents meet their responsibilities as parents . <p> The Secretary went on to say that the " Blueprint for Action " and the Healthy Child Care Campaign would help make the Administration 's vision a reality . She charged the participants to : ( 1 ) take ownership of the " Blueprint for Action " , ( 2 ) pledge at least one activity that would lead to healthy child care at the local community , and ( 3 ) build a constituency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child care . <p> The Healthy Child Care Campaign focuses attention on the health and child care linkages currently underway across the country . One of the first initiatives , a collaborative project between the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) and the American Public Health Association ( APHA ) , resulted in " Caring for Our Children : National Health and Safety Performance Standards : Guidelines for Out-of-Home Child Care Programs " . The project was funded through a grant from the Maternal and Child Health Bureau and has been instrumental in providing technical assistance to states to improve their child care standards . <p> Other initiatives include Medicaid outreach efforts among child care networks , involving health professionals in the licensing and monitoring process and accessing health and safety training through satellite linkages in rural areas . Our hope is to build on these efforts and to stimulate other initiatives nationwide . Below are examples of health and child care linkages operating across the country that can serve as models . <p> Pennsylvania has a unique public private partnership between the Pennsylvania Department of Public Welfare 's Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the American Academy of Pediatrics ' Early Childhood Education Linkage System ( ECELS ) . As a result of this partnership , the State has developed a system to monitor the status of immunizations and preventive health services for children in early care and education programs . The Public Welfare Bureau collects immunization and preventive health service data during a child care program 's annual licensing visit . <p> ECELS provides information on how to update child health records and offers local linkages with health professionals to child care providers whose child records do not document compliance with up-to-date immunizations and preventive health services . ECELS also provides technical assistance by telephone to child care providers about health and safety questions , arranges training for child care providers , and publishes a quarterly newsletter for child care providers and health consultants who work with child care providers . <p> The Collaborative Health Care and Training Project for Louisiana , was developed by the Louisiana Department of Health and the Child Care Resource and Referral agencies . This project includes a lengthy evaluation of what skills and knowledge are important for caregivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas such as hand washing , proper diapering and sanitary handling of foods . A more advanced level includes training in recognizing communicable diseases and signs of abuse . Louisiana is in the process of revising the module to include supervised practices to give caregivers hands-on training to ensure mastery of skills . <p> The Child Care Coalition of South Central Connecticut ( CCC/SCC ) provides a forum for parents , child care , health care and human service providers to exchange information and to collectively address issues of concern . Building linkages between child care providers and other health professionals working with young children and families is a major focus of the Coalition . Activities include publishing a newsletter for child care providers and parents which includes information on workshops on health and special needs issues ; advocating for affordable and accessible quality child care ; and providing consultation to area businesses regarding employer-sponsored child care options . The Child Care Coalition recently received a grant from the Department of Human Resources to coordinate a health/child care initiative involving 10 organizations in New Haven . The three-year grant will enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in identifying children and families in need of health care and social services . <p> The Arizona Self Study Project ( ASSP ) is a collaborative effort of the Arizona Department of Health Services , Department of Human Services , Department of Education Special Education , and other agencies to improve the quality and education of all young children in Arizona 's early childhood programs . The project provides consultation , technical assistance and " Self-Study " materials developed by the National Academy of Early Childhood Programs to early childhood programs statewide . <p> The Atlanta Family Child Care Health and Safety Project is administered by the Save the Children Child Care Support Center . This project addresses three related factors which impede the health and safety of children in family child care : the large number of unregistered providers , the high turnover rate among registered providers and the need for information about the most effective ways to train and support family child care providers . To address these factors , project staff engage in recruitment efforts and activities aimed at linking child care providers with services and organizations that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the project also provides free health and safety training and assistance to low income providers in meeting health and safety standards . <p> The Family Child Care Immunization Project , a three year project conducted by the Center for Health Training in San Francisco , California is developing training and technical assistance on materials to help family child care providers in California comply with the new immunization regulations . California child care licensing regulations will require family child care providers to check immunization records and ensure that the children in their care are adequately immunized . It is of utmost importance to ensure clear and appropriate training materials for child care providers who may not have a great deal of health experience . <p> The Center is conducting demonstration projects in local communities to determine what educational intervention is most cost effective in assisting Family Child Care Providers to screen children 's immunization records and comply with licensing requirements . According to Dr. Karen Sokal-Gutierrez , Project Specialist , the most exciting aspect of this project has been the development of linkages between the child care and health care community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain and grow after the project has been completed . <p> In order to ensure that this initiative impacts each and every community , we need your help . We need help in getting the word out that children in child care need to be immunized , and that their learning environments need to be safe and healthy . We need the very best health and nutrition education for parents , providers and children . <p> Creating partnerships , expanding knowledge and building on existing resources are actions which are key to initiating a successful campaign . Partnerships with families , the health community , and the business community will ensure that everyone is involved . Education to train both child care professionals on health care issues and health care professionals on child care issues will raise the understanding in both fields of the particular needs of children and providers . Building upon existing resources already in the community will enable communities to expand and improve on efforts already underway and avoid duplication of efforts . <p> You can make a difference by committing to at least one action that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Healthy Child Care Campaign . If you are eager to advance a healthy child care agenda in your community , you can contact the Child Care Bureau for further information about the " Blueprint " and about partners who are involved in the project . <p> Inquiries to the Child Care Bureau should be directed to : TABLE <p> ILLUSTRATION <p> By Moniquin Huggins <p> <p> Moniquin Huggins is a Child Care Program Specialist with the Child Care Bureau , Administration for Children and Families . <p>
