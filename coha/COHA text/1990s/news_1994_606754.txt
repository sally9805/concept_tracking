<p> In seas of hard-back metal chairs and from behind coffee-table lecterns , Montgomery County Council candidates this season are debating the growth in local taxes , cutbacks in education and library services and the public 's fear of violent crime . <p> In spite of all the rhetoric , local electioneering seems like a parlor game in which hard-core issues and new ideas are ill-defined . The most controversial figure on the political landscape continues to be a soft-spoken man , stiff in bearing , who turns 80 in March . <p> Neal Potter ( D ) was emblematic of change when his slow-growth philosophy swept him into the county executive 's office in 1990 , ousting incumbent Democrat Sidney Kramer . And after four recession-laden years of belt-tightening and tax increases under Potter 's helmsmanship , he may again be a symbol of change . <p> Many observers , particularly Republicans , say his time has come and gone . <p> Potter 's handpicked successor for county executive , at-large County Council member Bruce T. Adams , was soundly defeated in the Democratic primary . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as county executive and a former five-term council member , won a spot on the Democratic ticket for an at-large County Council seat by only 353 votes . <p> " I think most people see him as a competent individual who has worn out his welcome and should hang up his spurs , " said Robert C. Whittaker , 56 , of Brookeville , one of four Republican nominees for four at-large County Council seats . <p> Potter lays part of the blame for his current difficulties on his own party leaders . The Democratic nominee for county executive , former Rockville Mayor Douglas M. Duncan , attacked Potter 's administration as bloated , tax-laden and too deliberative . Duncan won by a sizable margin . <p> Republicans have taken notice . Potter 's " own party is saying that things are in disarray . ... That 's just going to come home to roost , " said Thomas S. Fess , 58 , of Rockville , another GOP nominee for an at-large County Council seat and an ombudsman and staff assistant for the county Board of Education . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts . Four are at-large members elected countywide . Republicans hold two of the district seats , but no Republican has been elected to an at-large council seat since 1966 . <p> Other Republican nominees for the at-large council seats are Lewis Helm , 63 , of Bethesda , a member and former chairman of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission and former campaign manager for Rep. Constance A. Morella ( R ) , and George E. Sauer , 60 , of Rockville , a local party leader . <p> Helm is the most-organized and best-financed Republican in the race . He attracts party bigwigs such as Alexander Haig and U.S. Sen. Alan K. Simpson ( Wyo. ) to fund-raisers ( his campaign treasury goal is $ 50,000 ) , and he has drafted the most specific list of cuts and proposed changes in county government . <p> The Democrats had 11 candidates when the at-large council race began . Primary voters nominated all three incumbents  --  Isiah Leggett , 59 , of Silver Spring , Gail Ewing , 49 , of Potomac , and Michael L. Subin , 45 , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . <p> Most Republican candidates have given up on the idea of defeating Leggett , whom they see as very popular right now . They say Ewing would be difficult as well . But Subin , Republicans contend , is too cozy with the business community and reportedly has a volatile temper on the council . Fess said he has witnessed Subin 's tantrums . <p> " I 've seen it as an employee of the school system , " he said . <p> Subin said he will stand on accomplishments in areas such as education , where he sponsored programs to bring executives into the schools as efficiency experts and to make social and health services available to parents and children at school sites . <p> And as for his temper , Subin said : " I love to debate . Sometimes it 's misunderstood as anger . No . No . No . " <p> But Republicans see their main target of opportunity as Potter  --  and he knows it . He has stepped up his fund-raising and hired a campaign manager . He reminds voters that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unemployment fell to 2.9 percent and the local economy improved . <p> In addition , Potter would like to see Duncan ease some of his campaign rhetoric . " I think the Democratic candidate for executive will have to stop painting such a dark picture of what 's going on in this county , " Potter said . <p> But if Potter 's struggle to win back a seat on the council is emblematic of changing philosophies in the county  --  and perhaps a move away from restrained growth  --  then the fortunes of a young Democrat in the race to represent sprawling District 2 on the council also bear watching . <p> Potter won his county executive seat in 1990 on a slow-growth platform , ousting the more builder-friendly regime of Kramer . Now , four years later , in an era when concerns over growth have taken a back seat to worries over crime and education cutbacks , Potter is struggling and Kramer 's son , Benjamin , is making an aggressive run for the District 2 council seat . Benjamin Kramer 's opponent is Republican incumbent Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't like me saying it , but she 's got the toughest race of the incumbents , " said Sauer , a member of the county Republican Central Committee . " Ben Kramer does know what he 's doing " when it comes to campaigning . <p> Like his father , Benjamin Kramer , 37 , of Derwood , is eager to promote business growth . He opposes a construction excise tax that Potter wants but the County Council has declined to implement . <p> Kramer , who said his father supports him , must beat Dacek in the county 's most conservative district , where Democrats claim 45 percent of the electorate . Nearly 40 percent of the voters are Republican , and 16 percent are independent . Dacek said public awareness of her opponent 's last name can cut both ways . <p> " It is a familiar name , but some people do n't support that name , " she said . <p> Dacek is touting her leadership record on the council and service on its education and public safety committees . <p> The Republican party 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pick up an at-large council post and capture the council seat in Rockville-centered District 3 . There , Democratic incumbent William E. Hanna Jr. , 73 , just weathered one of his toughest primary battles , winning with only 42 percent of the vote . A former Rockville mayor , Hanna is seeking a fourth term on the council . <p> The Republican challenger is Albert Keith , 41 , of North Potomac , a dental supply salesman and a former state campaign leader for Ross Perot . Republicans hope Keith can use those political contacts to snap up the district 's independents , accounting for 17 percent of registered voters in the Rockville area . <p> But in a district where voters like to see real slugfests in local elections , Keith is anything but a bruiser . <p> " I recognize that Mr. Hanna is a pretty good candidate as candidates go , " he said . " I do n't want to tear somebody down who 's given 25 years of good service to the county . " <p> Instead , Keith tries to distinguish his consensus-building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It 's no wonder that Hanna said he thought Keith  --  of all his opponents this year , Democrat or Republican  --  is the nicest . <p> Democrats make up a little more than half the voters in District 3 and Bethesda-based District 1 , where the incumbent is Republican Betty Ann Krahnke , 52 , of Chevy Chase . She is defending her first term on the council against the youngest of all council candidates , Democrat Michael E. Pollard , 26 , of Chevy Chase . <p> Pollard , an aide to North Dakota 's two U.S. senators , has a halting , awkward bearing when he debates . Still , he enjoys strong support from other Democrats on the County Council and is attacking Krahnke for her no votes on gun control and spending on social programs . <p> In the county 's two eastern council districts , where Democrats predominate , Republicans are painfully candid about their chances . <p> " I do n't have a snowball 's chance in hell of winning , " said Takoma Park Police Sgt. Mark Gardner , 29 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) in District 5 . " But on the same note , you can always pull out an upset . " <p> There are three Democrats for every Republican in this culturally diverse district . Gardner , who is one of only two African Americans in the County Council race ( the other is at-large incumbent Leggett ) , is attacking Berlage as indecisive . A high-profile issue in the campaign is affordable housing , and Gardner believes Silver Spring has more than its fair share . He noted that Berlage recently switched positions on a low-cost housing project slated for Juniper Street and Blair Road near Silver Spring and now opposes it . <p> " He flip-flopped , " said Gardner , who opposes the project . " I 'm not against low-cost housing . But I do n't think it should all be put in one district . " <p> In Colesville-centered District 4 , where there are twice as many Democrats as Republicans , incumbent Democrat Marilyn Praisner , 52 , of Calverton , faces Republican David W. Horner , 48 , of Silver Spring , a telecommunications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes and believes there 's a " fair amount of waste " in county government . Praisner , who served three terms on the county 's Board of Education and is seeking a second term on the County Council , says she has much leadership experience and , among other things , was named by Washingtonian magazine this year as one of the area 's " most powerful women . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : October 27 , 1994 , Thursday , Final Edition <p> CORRECTION : An article in the Oct. 20 edition of the Montgomery Weekly incorrectly reported that Montgomery County Council member Betty Ann Krahnke , of Chevy Chase , has voted against gun control bills considered by the council . Krahnke actually has never voted against a gun control measure on the council .
