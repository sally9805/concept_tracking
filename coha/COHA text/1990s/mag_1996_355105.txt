Managing a modern presidential campaign is often compared to selling soap . But an even better analogy would be to marketing a big Hollywood summer movie  --  and not just because summer movies and presidential candidates both tend to have problems with character . <P> " We 've often said that opening a movie is a lot like a political campaign in that we have an idea and the job is to make people want to see it , " says Barry London , a vice chairman at Paramount and the man in charge of marketing Mission : Impossible , which just had the second largest opening in movie history . By " idea , " London means the film 's conceit , in this case the conceit of sticking Tom Cruise in a movie version of a popular old TV show . In Hollywood , as you 've probably heard , this is known as a high concept , and if it 's grabby enough no one really cares if the actual movie 's any good or not ; the concept pretty much sells itself , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the N.B.A. to Kellogg 's Corn Pops helped too . <P> High concepts are also popular with politicians , who like to think of them as " issues "  --  something to keep in mind this summer when you hear about the dangers of same-sex marriage as often as you hear about Jim Carrey playing a demonic cable installer . Bob Dole 's campaign had what it thought was a grabby high concept in the fact that Bob Dole , a conservative war hero , is not President Clinton . But as the President takes his own conservative positions on issues like welfare and kiddie curfews , Clinton increasingly is Dole , which means that what Dole is n't is himself  --  a horrible conundrum best left pondered in college dorm rooms . When political pros say Dole needs to define his vision , what they really mean is that he needs a better high concept . He is said to be considering a 15% across-the-board tax cut , although given his history as a deficit hawk , this would be riskily out of character for Dole , like casting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old TV series  --  Gomer Pyle , say , or The Munsters . Actors call this stretching . So do political people . <P> Making matters even tougher for the Kansan is the fact that Clinton 's high concept is to remind everyone that Dole and Newt Gingrich have often shared a podium ; in today 's political climate this is the equivalent of having " starring Judd Nelson " at the top of your movie ad . Which does bring up a key difference between movies and presidential candidates : the Twister camp is n't saturating the airwaves with negative ads pointing out that the plot of Mission : Impossible makes no sense whatsoever . Not that it would matter : even fans of the film seem to recognize its shortcomings , shrugging them off with , " Hey  --  it 's a popcorn movie . " This token of the American public 's genius for tolerance should be a comfort to Clinton and Dole , given the fact that less than half the electorate , according to polls , says it would be proud to have either one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclear . But in the summer , at least , we 're easy .
