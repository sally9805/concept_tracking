Five summertime strategies that will get you fish when everyone else gives up . // Fishing in the heart of summer is n't always as productive as we hope , but that 's not the fault ofthe fish . They 're just adapting to changes brought about by the season . The problem is that most anglers do n't adapt as well as the fish do . I 've been guilty of this-for example , fishing in the easily accessed shallows rather than carefully probing the cooler deep haunts , or fishing in the places where I caught fish in the spring-but after a couple of decades of summer angling , I 've learned that catching fish now means focusing on their needs . Depth , cover , water temperature , lure selection , and time of day are more important in summer than at any other time . Naturally , these elements vary with different species , types of water , and latitudes , but those are the issues that should shape your thinking about where to fish and what to fish with in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water in summer think they 're ( a ) simply in the wrong shallow areas , ( b ) using the wrong lures , or ( c ) victims of lethargic fish . So they keep moving , changing places and lures , and pounding away at the same types of places . Better to move away from the shallows and start fishing deeper . This may be where the most comfortable water temperature is , where the best feeding opportunities are , or where fish-depending on the particular body of water-are least disturbed by human activities on the water . For bass , deep water may be simply 8 to 10 feet in a lake with an average depth of 3 feet , or it may be 20 or more feet deep in a big-water reservoir that has good supplies of schooling baitfish , such as shad . In the latter case , vertical jigging is a tactic that many anglers ( overly accustomed to casting and retrieving ) do n't try to master . They also do n't try trolling , which is an overlooked bass tactic in lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take smallmouth bass , white bass , and striped bass .

When fishing for species that do n't roam much ( bass , crappies , and bluegills ) , try to seek depths that also offer some cover or protection . This is why brushpiles are placed in otherwise clean-bottomed impoundments and attract both forage fish and predators . Fishing Carolina-rigged worms on bottom irregularities , especially humps in the open water of big lakes , is a good way to locate larger-thanaverage bass . In rivers and streams , summer fishing usually means deep fishing as well . Smallmouth bass and walleyes generally hold close to bottom in moving water , and most daytime presentations should be deep . Focus your efforts on objects that break the current , such as rocks , boulders , fallen trees , uprooted stumps , and bridge supports . Probe Heavy Weeds Not every body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilizes it , but if you find heavy vegetation , do n't ignore it or avoid it because it looks too tough to fish . Walleyes , bass , pike , muskies , crappies , sunfish , and yellow perch will seek refuge in vegetation during the summer because it offers camouflage , shade , and easy forage opportunities . Vegetation types vary widely , but it is at its thickest in midsummer . Look to weed edges , protrusions , deepwater beds , thick clumps surrounded by thinner weeds , and the water between weedbeds and the shore .

This is seldom effective . Midsummer fish are often deep within heavy cover , especially in daylight hours , and usually have plenty of feeding opportunities . They are not in a rush when ensconced in cover . Detecting strikes in the weeds can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minnows for walleyes ) , so fish slowly and deliberately . Find Cool Water The preferred water temperature of fish varies by species . Temperature is especially relevant to trout and salmon , inland stripers , walleyes , and smallmouth bass . Equally important is the fact that water temperature has a strong influence on certain baitfish species-especially alewives , smelt , and shad-which will dictate where their predators will be . By locating the preferred temperature range of the species , you 'll be able to fish at that depth while searching for the bait . Not all cool water is necessarily deep . Small lakes and ponds often have spring-fed pockets of water that are a few degrees cooler than surrounding environs . Anyone who has swum in a small lake or pond in summer , especially in the northern latitudes , has felt a temperature change as they passed over a spring . These places are often attractive to fish in the heat of the summer . Places where tributaries enter a lake-even a rivulet coursing through well-shaded woods-provide subtle and favorable temperature differences in the height of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are as good in midsummer as they will be all year long . Determine what these gamefish are feeding on , exclusively or primarily , and more important , what size that forage is . Stream-trout anglers do this all the time ; lake anglers often do n't . Bass fishermen , because their quarry is aggressive and sometimes gluttonous , frequently overlook the need to scale their offerings down to more closely imitate the prevalent natural food . Fish Early , Fish Late Fish are more aCtive and less wary during low-light conditionsearly morning , late evening , overcast days , and nighttime  --  which allows you to avoid some typical summertime problems , such as pressure from other anglers , bright conditions that make fish wary , and recreational boaters that outright spook fish . And some species , like striped bass , are naturally more active at night or in low light .
