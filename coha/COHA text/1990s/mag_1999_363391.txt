The terror of terrorism is what you do n't know . You can listen all you want to warnings to be vigilant . Cops can scan crowds ; dogs can sniff luggage ; border crossings can be tightened ; you can report parcels left unattended . But if  --  when  --  it comes , you wo n't be warned . " We 're not confident we can stop it , " admits an Administration official . <P> Nonetheless , the Clinton team is determined to try . It lives in dread of an NSSE  --  the Disneyesque abbreviation for a national-security special event that triggers special precautions . But with Y2K happening all across the world , a flood of threats has washed in from every corner of the globe , and suspicious characters have been arrested . There 's no shortage of danger out there . The government has conducted drills in 27 cities for an NSSE , but the real strategy is " Raise your defenses and plan for the aftermath .

Is Osama bin Laden masterminding a spectacular millennial blast , or would something come from an unknown , homegrown wacko ? <P> Terrorism has undergone a sea change since the old days of skyjackings and hostage taking . Back then , the who and the why were known : leftists like the Red Brigades and the Baader-Meinhof gang , nationalists like the I.R.A. , the P.L.O . and the Kurdish Workers ' Party , and state sponsors like Syria and Iran , all with rational political objectives .
