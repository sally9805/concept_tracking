Rock fans in their chair days can recall a distant dawn when pop music was about having a good time  --  fun fun fun for sweet little 16 at the hop . But that was before guys who knew three guitar chords were dubbed artists and , as such , had to suffer out loud for their muse . Consumers of pop have become so used to dirges about life 's rottenness , sung by grungesters crushed under the weight of money , fame , drugs and women , that any happy music seems like ad jingles . Even female singers , traditionally dainty types , got the message . Does n't Alanis Morissette sound as if she 's performing at riflepoint in a gulag ? <P> Nanci Griffith , prom princess of the country-folk school , dares to suggest that life is something we can get through  --  and get through more easily with a rousing or sweet-souled tune . Griffith , 42 , might be doomed to good humor , with her chipmunk-cute face and perky soprano . In her new CD , Blue Roses from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplicity . The bass-heavy Wall of Sound from her 1994 Flyer has crumbled ; this is a live-in-the-studio set with a country feel and , among the sidemen , songwriter Sonny Curtis and the three survivors from Buddy Holly 's Crickets . The team is relaxed and enthusiastic ; it 's the aural equivalent of a good mood . <P> You can tell a lot about a singer-composer 's intent on an album by her choice of cover songs . The ones here , like Curtis ' I Fought the Law , tiptoe toward depression , then poke it in the ribs . The broody lyrics of Nick Lowe 's Battlefield ( " All around there is desolation/ And scenes of devastation/ Of a love being torn apart " ) get swallowed and spat out by the jouncy banjo , the skiffle beat and the Jordanaires-style backing vocals , till the whole thing sounds like a minstrel show staged by Grand Ole Opry ; everyone has a high time playing at misery . <P> It 's not that people are n't sad , do n't get kicked around , never die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it atomizes them . The nostalgic poignancy of Griffith 's Two for the Road hints at chances missed but also the pleasure of a longtime lover 's company . Saint Teresa of Avila , a requiem for a childhood friend who killed herself , is addressed less to the dead woman or to those who miss her than to the saint who is expected to welcome her to heaven . Everything 's Comin ' Up Roses is a postmortem snapshot : " When I 'm pushin ' up daisies , " the roses will still bloom . <P> Country music , even in the depths , is essentially Christian : it sees a happy ending , if not in this life , then in eternity . Death is a " sweet bluebonnet spring " ( " When we die we say we 'll catch some blackbird 's wings/ And we will fly away to heaven " ) in the gorgeous remake of her Gulf Coast Highway , a duet with Hootie 's Darius Rucker . His gruff baritone and Griffith 's twangy soprano soar apart , then join in double @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolling piano , electric slide guitar  --  makes the song a pretty little anthology of pop 's fine old tendency to synthesize , not isolate , strains of music . Listening in the Great Beyond to Griffith 's salving ballads , God might tap His foot . Even Kurt Cobain might crack an enlightened smile . <P>  --  By Richard Corliss
