They started to gather at six o'clock . Sonya , who always got there first , at once went into the kitchen and made coffee , so there was a hot cup ready for Slauson 's elderly cousin Willis when she arrived with the cakes and cookies . Ava came by and by and of course told them that she wanted nothing to eat or drink , but she was already contentedly eating and drinking when Arno drove up with , " my dears , the most succulent roast turkey ( already sliced ) which I have ever made and you . Have ever tasted !  --  and where is our dear old Slauson , may I ask , " he demanded , setting down the vast plate . <p> " Where should he be ? " asked Heimberger , striding in with wine and whiskey and filling the place with his vast bulk . " Upstairs , inserting semicolons in this year 's epic opus : can a publisher sell semicolons . I have probably lost a thousand dollars for his every semicolon over the past twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge hairy fingers reached out and captured a glazed turkey-wing . <p> So they were all there when Farmer came in , pretending to shield his eyes and scout around . " And where is this year 's or shall I say this month 's Slauson 's new friend ? Hello Heimberger , Sonya , Ava , Arno , Willis . . . . This time I drove five hundred miles to the reading , so it better be good , although , " he lowered his voice , " I 'm afraid it wo n't . " <p> Willis , her voice by now almost quavering so old she was , " Oh shame on you , Farmer . Shame on you . " <p> " If he did n't waste his time and your money , Willie , on those so-called new friends of his , " Ava began . <p> Arno did n't wait for her to finish . " Well , Slauson will just want to live in a house by the side of the road and be a friend to man and woman . They leech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one never sees them again , and then poor Slauson tries to write . And tries aannd tries . . . . " He sighed , said , " A teeny taste of that cake , Willis . Oh . OH . It , is , so , goood ! Willis , where do you buy  --  " <p> Slauson came in just at that moment . <p> " Are you all right , dear ? " asked Ada . " You seem a trifle  --  " <p> " It is nothing , " said Slauson . " I was in the cellar burying a body . " <p> " Of your dead past , no doubt ? " <p> Everybody chuckled empathetically and when the chuckles had quite died away Slauson cleared his throat and began to read . <p> He read for half an hour . He read for an hour . He read for an hour and a half . No one coughed . No one lit a cigarette . No one did anything connected with water . Slauson read for one hour and fifty-seven minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Then Sonya began to scream and when the scream was understood to be " Bravo ! " others joined her . Willie clapped her splayed arthritic paws . Ava kissed him repeatedly . Arno murmured passionate impossible murmurs in his ears ; and Helmberger , mustache wet with tears , could only mutter , brokenly , " . . . morrow . . . contract . . . advance . . . greatest . . . escalator clause third hundred thousand . . . . " <p> Finally Farmer 's dry , critic 's voice , slightly husky now , was heard to say , "  --  worth any sacrifice : For having written that , an entire life is not too much to have given ! " <p> Hear , hear ! they all cried , Willis thumping her cane on the floor . <p> Hear , hear ! <p> <p> By Avram Davidson <p> When former F &; SF editor Avram Davidson died in 1993 , he left a treasure trove of his delightful fiction .
