Bob Dole says he 's out to close the gender gap , yet his campaign is not using its greatest asset with working women : Liddy . Since her boffo show in San Diego , Elizabeth has gone under the national radar . She spends most of her time in places like Dover , Delaware , and Knoxville , Tennessee  --  not exactly major markets . She makes a fleeting appearance in one ad . The press is usually not allowed on her plane . What 's more , she 's rarely at her husband 's side . And when she is , she almost never makes any remarks . The campaign says that Elizabeth will be seen more  --  this week she 's on the Tonight Show  --  but the established routine will hold . Conventional wisdom says First Ladies do n't impact elections . But it does n't make sense for the campaign to turn its popular steel magnolia into a wallflower . <P>  --  Tamala M.
