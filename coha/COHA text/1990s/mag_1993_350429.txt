The 230-mile charter flight from Miami to Havana went as planned until the final approach to the airport . Suddenly the pilot announced a landing delay because of unexpected congestion . " The problem was n't other planes but cows on the runway . We ended up circling for 25 minutes until they were cleared away , " said TIME senior editor Johanna McGeary on her return from a two-week reporting assignment that led to this week 's cover story . <P> McGeary 's visit was a rare opportunity , because the U.S. generally forbids its citizens to visit Cuba , and Havana issues few visas to American reporters . Exploring what may lie ahead for the long-isolated country was an irresistible challenge to McGeary , who had served as TIME 's State Department correspondent and Jerusalem bureau chief before becoming editor of the World section in 1988 . McGeary is not one to grow complacent behind a desk . " The best part of journalism is reporting , " she says . " I was a correspondent for 14 years before turning editor , and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <P> And what a story . Fidel Castro 's efforts to restrict press coverage have long made Cuba " one of the big , black holes of journalism , " says McGeary . But times are changing . To her surprise , McGeary faced little interference from the government officials assigned to monitor her activities . " The authorities now seem sophisticated enough to gamble that if Americans see Cuba for themselves , they wo n't see the country just in black or white . " Accompanied by Miami bureau chief Cathy Booth , McGeary logged hundreds of miles driving around the island . They interviewed hitchhikers , housewives , mine workers and bureaucrats . " The people were more willing than ever to talk about their frustrations and hopes for change , " said Booth , who had traveled to Cuba three times since 1991 . <P> The candor may stem from desperation . There are chronic food shortages ( except in tourist hotels ) and a virtual absence of such necessities as toilet paper and toothpaste . The capital 's cityscape is bleak . " Havana is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights and no people on the streets , except for prostitutes , " McGeary says . Yet most Cubans refuse to lose hope . Their vitality is what adds so much intrigue to the unfolding saga of the western hemisphere 's last remaining Communist outpost .
