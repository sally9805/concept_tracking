Section : Articles THE AUGUST REVOLUTION <p> IT IS a cliche of history that revolutions are followed by reactions . In the August Revolution , the reaction came first . Communist hard-liners , dismayed by the course of events , had already attempted to derail reform with a crackdown in Lithuania last winter . But they had not reckoned with the force of popular resistance . Then , in the spring , a push to unseat Boris Yeltsin brought vast demonstrations and Gorbachev scurrying back toward the reformers . The fruit of their collaboration was a Union treaty redefining the relationships of the Republics and the center . In all the years of perestroika , this would have been the first serious institutional reform , spelling the end of any chance of a return to Communist orthodoxy . The empire struck back for one last time . The effect was to accelerate the tempo of reform immensely  --  and to put the reformers at the forefront of the process , instead of acting as uneasy nior partners to Gorbachev . <p> It seems inevitable in retrospect that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the putschmeisters gave off an aura of defeat even as they held their press conference . The technological resources of dissidents and democrats proved too numerous for the hard-liners to squelch . Telephones , faxes , and satellite uplinks kept the whole world watching and the freedo  --  fighters in touch with one another . ( One cell of putsch resisters was working the phones from within the Kremlin itself , down the hall from Gennady Yanayev 's office . ) Too many people had seen too much , said too much , and done too much to be willing to go back to an Ice Age of totalitarianism . <p> This Soviet pluralism , we should concede , was the legacy of Mikhail Gorbachev . A reform Communist , he did not want or foresee a truly free society . But his actions set the Soviet Union on the road to one ; and as it developed in directions he had not chosen , he refrained from violence to halt it . Even as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn laid a rose on the grave of Nikita Khrushchev , we must pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bouquet . Beginning as an earnest apparatchik offended by Party privileges , he developed into a principled champion of freedom . The Union treaty that triggered the putsch was his work ; so are the sweeping post-putsch reforms . The hard-liners collapsed as swiftly as they did because , at the crucial moment , Yeltsin scrambled atop a tank and persuaded the world that the coup could be resisted . His courage and presence of mind transformed one tank into an army . <p> The final heroes were the people who rallied around the Russian White House and the soldiers who refused to shoot their fellow countrymen . For years , the Russians bore the onus of a people who did not deserve , because they did not desire , freedom . Their past was autocracy ; their future was Communism . August 1991 puts that libel to rest . Russians , it turns out , are like people everywhere , capable of choosing good as well as ill . Last month , they fought to preserve the limited freedoms they had been allowed  --  and , in doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it ? Unintended Republics <p> AS MATTERS STAND  --  and they are changing hourly  --  the best answer is a qualified and cautious yes . The USSR is being reconstituted on a freer , looser , more democratic , and more realistic basis . Power now lies with the Republics ; Gorbachev  --  if he accepts the logic of the new situation  --  becomes more and more the figurehead . The abrupt cancellation of his initial interim cabinet appointments ; his repudiation of the Communist Party two days after his news conference proclaiming his loyalty to it ; his co-signing of the new plan for restructuring the Soviet Union which ratifies the emasculation of the central authority  --  these events confirm the new reality . The central government is being reduced to a weak national authority , nominally in charge of foreign affairs , defense , and some other basic functions , but in fact beholden to the constituent Republics , which will collectively determine its policies . <p> The Russians , who are in a position to dominate the new structure , are so far playing by the rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeltsin has had to give the other Republics adequate reassurances . At least ten of those Republics seem to share the same interest in the continuing existence of a central authority , in whose policies they will have an equal voice ; none of them , not even Russia , wants a strong central government , which they all see as contrary to the very democratic pluralism and economic decentralization for which they have so long struggled . Western concerns about the privatization ' of Soviet nuclear weapons are addressed thus : the country 's nuclear arsenal will remain intact , under central authority , while its massive conventional forces are being shrunk and divided up along Republic lines . The Republics , many of which ( like the Ukraine ) much prefer to be nuclear-free , are satisfied by a share in decision making . <p> The West can welcome all this . With the Baltic states completely split off , and other Republics seeking UN membership and varying degrees of real independence , our erstwhile adversary will have become a political and economic structure eminently suited to addressing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffective for committing or threatening aggression abroad . <p> There are , however , serious threats to the new democracy : economic collapse , Communist bureaucrats still in place , ethnic rivalry , military forces resentful of their loss of pre-eminence . Another coup down the road can not be ruled out . How ironic , then , that since the coup Yeltsin , democracy 's defender , has become the target of disparaging comments from the Administration , casting doubt on his democratic credentials . We find it odd for the Administration so to demean a man who was dumped from the Party leadership because he attacked the Party 's privileges , in favor of another who reiterated his continuing faith in Communism the day after his release from Crimean captivity . Yeltsin has also allegedly contributed to the breakup of the Union and invited chaos . Again , we note that Yeltsin is the only man in a position to hold the Soviet Union together on any basis  --  after years of Gorbachev 's heavy-handed bungling on this score  --  and that he is holding it together on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign policy that promises to be even more conciliatory than Gorbachev 's . <p> Prudence argues that , if the Bush Administration has a dim view of Yeltsin , it should keep that opinion to itself . Even more , we question the analysis . Yeltsin 's victory is the victory of all the peoples of the former Union . It is the victory of democracy and peace . It is the victory of ordinary common humanity over utopian zeal and bureaucratic rule . A Paradise Well Lost <p> NOW THAT Marxism - Leninism is finally consigned to that dustbin of history it prescribed for others , we can attempt to put it into historical perspective . It represented an impressive effort to harness , systematize , and give organized political power to powerful nineteenth-century utopian impulses . Beneath the crust of its conventions and manners , the nineteenth century seethed with a tropical growth of personal and public rebellions . There was anarchism , socialism , free love , vegetarianism , prohibitionism , Shakerism , and eccentric communities of all sorts . <p> What Marxism accomplished was to discipline those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' course of history . The Marxist consolidation of the varied utopian impulses may now be seen as a large iceberg in the way of Western civilization . Some tens of millions of lives later , however , the Marxist iceberg drifted into warmer historical waters and with astounding rapidity began to melt . All of a sudden it is gone . <p> But the nineteenth-century utopian impulses that underlie Marxism are unlikely to disappear as quickly . In the approaching future they will take fresh forms : ecology fascism , health fascism , forbidden speech codes , radical feminism , reverse racism , multiculturalism , ' and so on . Where Marxism claimed the mantle of scientific efficiency , these less disciplined utopias stress less falsifiable themes such as sensitivity ' or fairness . ' Where Marxists placed their faith in a politically conscious proletariat , the new utopians seek to create an alliance of minorities and outsiders such as gays , feminists , and the discontented of every stripe . <p> Yet traditional Marxists and the new utopians agree in seeking to use the power of the state to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopians have enjoyed more success in this than anyone would have considered possible thirty years ago . They have persuaded government to adopt racial quotas , busing , educational fads , and burdensome regulations of all kinds . In social life they have employed largely bogus concepts of sexism ' to make people feel guilty about traditional sexual roles and attitudes . And they have in general succeeded in making government action seem the obvious solution to almost any social problem . <p> With the collapse of Communism , however , such ideas are likely to lose much of their power . They were propelled in large measure by the widespread feeling , even found among their opponents , that this coercive utopianism somehow represented the future of mankind . And the more news comes out of Moscow revealing the terrible human consequences of the Communist brand of utopianism , the more utopian politics in general will be discredited . Thus , as the new utopians ' causes provoke mounting inconvenience , irritation , and expense in everyday American life , so political resistance to them is likely to grow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced march to Utopia has been called off amid reports of flies , swamps , and non-existent plumbing , package tours there will lose much of their appeal . A World Restored <p> IN FOREIGN AFFAIRS a Soviet retrenchment has been under way for a number of years . Western solidarity and Soviet economic weakness still dictate a policy of accommodation . What the failure of the August coup has done is to cripple the forces within the Soviet system that resisted those constructive trends . Traditional Soviet clients  --  Cuba , Afghanistan , Vietnam , the PLO , and other unsavory radicals  --  can see the handwriting on the wall ; their patrons within the Soviet military and Party apparatus are now mostly unemployed if not in jail . Andrei Kozyrev , now Yeltsin 's foreign minister , was one of the leaders , a few years ago , among Soviet diplomats who repudiated the thuggery and adventurism of the Brezhnev foreign policy . His kind will now call the tune . <p> The world may now become , as Charles Krauthammer has written , a unipolar ' one  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only superpower . Given America 's lack of eagerness and aptitude for hegemonic policies , however , it may become more the multipolar world that others have long heralded  --  a world in which America , Europe , Japan , China , the USSR ( now way down in the league standings ) , and various Third World powers grope for new patterns of coexistence and cooperation . But the decision will be ours . <p> In making it we will find out who our friends are . Apparently not the French Socialists , who have already ( in the persons of Roland Dumas and Jacques Delors ) announced their alarm at an America that has no counterweight . But this attitude will be no more than a minor irritant . The Gulf War and the brief Soviet coup demonstrated that Europe 's security still depends on the United States , and efforts to extend European integration to the security field have foundered on the contradictions among the Europeans themselves . Most Europeans , East and West , find a strong American presence far preferable to the dominance of any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow August will be a fresh breeze of democracy around the globe . The threat to Castro , Najibullah , Kim Il-Sung , Assad , et al . is not simply the cutoff of Soviet aid but the evaporation of the last illusion that their styles of government have a special permanence , or any shred of legitimacy . Socialism ' is no longer available as an excuse that anyone takes seriously ; history is no longer available as evidence of inevitability . What the revolution of 1989 began is now underscored . st as Marxist revolutionaries in the past took heart from the success of their brothers , now the moral tide is with the West and its ideals of political and economic freedom . <p> It will be a somewhat chaotic world . Freedom is a chaotic kind of thing . Ethnic turmoil is inevitable , and tragic . Once the post-1945 taboo against border changes is broken , there will be no end to disputes  --  including disputes among what once were units of the Soviet empire . The world community should do its best to facilitate peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stification for situations of patent instice or repression . No stability lies that way either . <p> The task of statesmen is to see to the basic structure of world politics . If relations among the major powers are solid and stable , no Sarajevo can precipitate world war . If America remains in Europe as a reassurance to those who fear domination by any power in Europe ( whether Germany or a restored Russia ) , then Europe will be secure . If America retains the military strength globally to deter the Saddam Husseins , then the world will be secure . Not all local instabilities will be of strategic importance ; a few will be . We can handle such a burden without strain . It will be a world in which all enemies of freedom will be on the defensive . It will be a world of some turbulence , to be sure , but not a world of which America need be afraid . Quite the contrary . It will be , in large measure , an American world . <p> Cartoon : MACNELLY <p> By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
