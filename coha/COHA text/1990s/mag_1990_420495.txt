Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS <p> Congress and the administration finally agree on a budget package . But Bush 's plummeting approval ratings could drag down GOP candidates . <p> The conflict between the two George Bushes  --  the shrill , partisan politician and the kinder , gentler president  --  was never clearer than it was last week . Appearing at a Republican fund-raiser in Irvine , Calif. , the partisan Bush complained that " the Democratically controlled Congress simply has been on an uncontrolled spending binge for years . You do n't have to be a rocket scientist to know that Congress has been spending more than we take in for far too long . " Then , mindful that his hopes for cutting the federal deficit depended entirely on those very same Democrats , Bush turned on a metaphorical dime . He praised the opposition for " working cooperatively " on the deficit deal , adding " for that , I salute them , because I firmly believe that we must get an agreement to start getting these deficits under control . " <p> Bush was caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in revolt over the necessity of raising taxes ( page 23 ) , the president was forced to rely on Democratic support to pass a deficit-reduction deal  --  something he 'd been calling for since May . At the same time , Bush and his political handlers were trying to fend off what could yet be a GOP disaster in the 1990 elections . His awkward attempt to straddle those conflicting purposes  --  to have his budget deal and make war on the Democrats , too  --  nearly backfired . Back in Washington , where the election-bound House and Senate were racing to complete the year 's legislative business , the partisan portions of Bush 's speech came close to triggering an 11th-hour meltdown in the House . " Why should we vote for it when the president and White House chief of staff John Sununu are out kicking the package ? " complained a House Democratic aide , expressing a widely held view . <p> In the end , the much-debated deal passed by a scant 10 votes in the House and by 3 votes in the Senate . Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the electorate 's rising rage at weeks of political gamesmanship , finally summoned up the nerve to Do the Right Thing about the deficit  --  even if it meant raising taxes in an election year . The climactic vote came shortly after 7 a.m. , following a 21-hour marathon session in the House . As weary members pawed through the few available photocopies of the massive bill , House leaders took the floor to keep their wavering troops in line . " The American people have had enough of being told that somehow we can confront the deficit and it does n't involve pain , " said Rep. Leon Panetta , chairman of the House Budget Committee . " The fact is-that it does , and that is what this package is all about . " Ways and Means Committee chairman Dan Rostenkowski said the bill would reduce " the debt on each of our kids by $2,000 , " and House GOP leader Robert Michel argued that the voters " would rather have imperfect progress than perfect paralysis . " <p> That there was any deal at all was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best a limited victory , and it was obtained at a severe cost . Since June 26 , when he renounced his no-new-taxes pledge , the president 's ratings have dropped through the floor : NEWSWEEK 'S latest Gallup survey shows that only 48 percent of the voters still think he is doing a good job . That is a new low for the Bush presidency , which until very recently was basking in one of the longest political honeymoons on record , and it is already fueling speculation that the president may be vulnerable after all . " I think George Bush can be beaten in 1992 , " House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt told The Washington Post last week . " In the last two months he 's shown a real failure of leadership . He needed to explain to the American people why they were being asked to swallow strong medicine , but he did n't do it . " <p> The verdict from panicked Republicans both in Washington and around the country , was similar  --  which is one reason why Bush , stumping in New Hampshire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Republican candidate and in a public dispute over tax policy with another . With the 1990 election only days away , the president 's growing political weakness threatened GOP candidates everywhere . It also forced the Republicans to abandon their previous hopes of picking up seats in Congress : according to Beltway handicappers , the GOP was all but certain to lose eight to 10 seats in the House despite a multimillion-dollar effort to challenge the Democrats ' control . " I have n't talked to one GOP strategist who is n't beside himself , " said analyst Douglas Bailey . " There 's no good news out there . " <p> Who pays ? The obvious explanation was that Bush had blundered into the cross-fire of the great budget wars . Conservatives like Rep. Newt Gingrich , the House minority whip , insisted the president was paying the price for his July flip-flop on taxes , which one White House adviser gloomily described as " the worst mistake of his presidency . " That was arguably the case , at least where Republican voters were concerned . But NEWSWEEK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deficit plan to be " unfair "  --  and that finding , though open to interpretation , suggests that Bush was also in trouble with low- and moderate-income voters precisely because of his attempts to protect the well-to-do . Democrats thought the deficit controversy had revived their best issue : fairness . " We have begun to redefine the debate from ' to tax or not to tax ' to ' who pays , and is it fair ? ' " Gephardt said . " This gives us a shot at reclaiming large groups of middle-class Americans who have n't been excited about Democrats for quite some time . " <p> The larger question was whether the compromise package lived up to its billing as the biggest , most honest attempt to reduce the deficit in U.S. history . True , the congressional plan came very close to meeting Bush 's original goals : it called for a five-year , $490 billion deficit cut financed about equally by reduced federal spending and increased federal revenues . The deficit-reduction goal for 1991 was a paltry $40 billion , which would still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But few experts believe the economic forecasts on which those goals were based , and many predict that even a mild recession would balloon the deficit well beyond current projections . Further , the package was a massive retreat from the old Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law , which imposed a $64 billion deficit target for 1991 . When the costs of the federal savings and loan bailout were included , the package called for federal spending to rise by $109 billion in 1991  --  a startling 9 percent increase in federal spending that was being sold to the public as a step toward fiscal sanity . <p> There were other elements of hocus-pocus in the deficit package as well . In fact , the budget " cuts " outlined in the plan were reductions in projected federal spending over the next five years  --  not actual cuts from current budget levels . Even so , the congressional package actually specified only $135 billion in spending cuts for 1991 and 1992 . The rest  --  $116 billion  --  was no more than a congressional promise to cut the budget at a later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscenity to call it that , " said Republican Rep. Craig James of Florida . Others were incensed by an outrageous example of pork-barrel spending in the 1991 agriculture budget-$500,000 to restore Lawrence Welk 's birthplace in Strasburg , N.D. , as a federally subsidized tourist attraction . That bit of fiscal foolishness , the work of Sen. Quentin Burdick of North Dakota , had talk-show hosts all around the country howling . " Everyone does what they can for their own constituents , " a Burdick aide blandly explained . <p> With the deficit package finally passed into law , for better or worse , hundreds of nervous House and Senate members are heading home for a rendezvous with the voters . George Bush may already be a casualty , and as Election Day 1990 approaches , none of the incumbents  --  including Democrats  --  could feel certain they would escape the voters ' wrath . <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : A double bind : Bush in New Hampshire , Darman and Gingrich ( top ) , House Speaker Thomas Foley and Gephardt ( left ) <p> PHOTO ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> By TOM MORGANTHAU with THOMAS M.
