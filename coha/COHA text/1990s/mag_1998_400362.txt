Photograph // The idea for an organized bike ride through the cruel and majestic Rocky Mountains struck Claire Martin while she was pedaling along a table-flat road in the middle of a cornfield . At the time The Denver Post staff writer was riding the ' 85 RAGBRAI and her two-wheeled revelation went something like this : " If they can get 10,000 people to ride across Iowa , we can sure get 2,000 to ride across Colorado . " Thus was born an arduous but wildly popular Centennial State cycling tradition . Martin was right ; what became know as " Ride the Rockies " was an instant success-in large part because of Colorado 's huge population of boomer-generation athletes . In fitness hotspots like Boulder , residents joke that you 're issued a handicapped sticker if your body fat is over 10% . According to tour director Paul Balaguer , " It took three weeks to sell out 1,500 slots in ' 86 . We increased the rider limit to 2,000 but by ' 88 it sold out in two hours . People were camping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lottery system in ' 89 . " And unlike most lotteries , this one has pretty good odds : 70-80% , according to Balaguer . The non-profit RTR has been sponsored from its inception primarily by The Denver Post , which donates the proceeds to charities . In spite of its popularity , RTR is anything but an easy spin . Visiting flatlanders go goggle-eyed at the daily dose of 2,000 to 7,000 vertical feet of climbing at elevations ranging from 5,000 to over 12,000 feet-for six days and approximately 400 miles . " Every year a few people complete the ride without any bike training at all , " Balaguer says in wonderment , but most participants do at least a thousand miles in preparation , including a long ride of 75-80 miles . But with the exception of a few fast pacelines , most riders take it slow and stop for frequent scenery breaks . Still , it 's the difficulty , combined with mountain vistas and weather ranging from arid heat to high-altitude snowstorms , that define this event . For all the challenge it offers , RTR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful portable toilets and frequent aid stations . Balaguer rides every inch of the route in April , spying out rest stops and noting potential problems like narrow roads or left turns with poor line-of-sight for oncoming drivers . Many riders camp each night on school athletic fields . In that teeming tent city , reliving the day 's ride is a popular activity . Host communities organize activities like concerts and bus tours to local attractions . Tech support is provided by local bike shops and the Trek Wrench Force . Each afternoon , riders can take advantage of talks by cycling personalities such as BICYCLING Pro Advisory Team members Ron Kiefel and Davis Phinney , retired pros who are frequent participants on the ride . Photograph // For many cyclists , the cross-state ride is the season 's biggest social event . Montrose 's Dave Saksek , a high school teacher , has done RTR six times . " I 've met some wonderful people , " he says , " and it 's fun because everyoneriders , crew and volunteersare connected by cycling . One year I rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sprinted for the top . He beat me by three feet . Everyone at the aid station cheered like it was a mountaintop finish in the Tour de France . " Communities on the route benefit as much as the participants . Towns vie for inclusion , knowing that hungry cyclists will spend about $125,000 during their 15-hour stay . Kathy Heavers was a member of the coordinating committee in Montrose , a stop on the ' 97 ride . " We work for months getting ready , " she says . " But it creates a great sense of community because it pulls people together-cyclists , food service , law enforcement and the town 's movers and shakers . The ride builds civic pride . " To qualify , towns need at least 700 hotel rooms and roads safe enough to handle the crowd . " The day we announce the tour route , towns sell out all their rooms , " Balaguer says . Safety is a major concern for Balaguer . Each day 's route is monitored by six to twelve Colorado Highway Patrol officers . Medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily identified by marked helmets donated by Giro . In spite of narrow , mountainous roads , the event has been remarkably safe . Still , two incidents haunt Balaguer . In ' 93 , a rider lost control , hit a bridge abutment and died nine months later . The following year , a rider was fatally struck by a truck . Is the enormous responsibility worth it ? " No question , " says Balaguer . " People tell me they never thought they could do it . But they bought a bike , started riding , and at the finish , their families greet them with flowers and signs and tears . They say to me : I 've changed the way I live my life . ' Now that 's exciting . " For information on the ' 99 Ride the Rockies , contact The Denver Post , 303/820-1602 ( CO ) . The route is announced the first Sunday in February . Registration is by lottery . The event begins on the third Sunday in June . The registration fee of$195 includes camping space , showers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sag vehicles , medical support , as well as the de rigeur jersey , water bottle and map book . Photograph Sidebar JOURNAL ENTRY : THE START Sidebar FOR MOST OF THE 2,000 PARTICIPANTS , Ride the Rockies ' 97 begins in tents dotting a football field in Grand Junction , Colorado . Sidebar Long before dawn , riders wriggle out of sleeping bags into the high desert chill . Early starts make sense when you have mountains ( and more mountains ) to climb . As the sun rises over the colorful tent city , I stand there mesmerized along with everyone else , peering to the east where snowcovered Grand Mesa , the highest flat-topped mountain in the world , levitates on clouds a mile above the valley floor . The route-90 miles with nearly 7,000 feet of vertical gain-snakes up the north side past the Powderhorn Ski Sidebar runs and across the lake-dotted top before swooping down to Delta . * A first-day official sendoff is a Ride the Rockies tradition and Grand Junction does it right . The speeches by sleepy civic dignitaries are short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roll-out is marshalled through every intersection . Imagine being able to run traffic lights not only with impunity but with a police escort as well . But 15 miles later when the grade abruptly steepens near the mountain town of Mesa , the steady stream of riders fragments into groups of two or three . We pedal steadily , still fresh enough to be stunned speechless by the scenery . Sidebar I JOURNAL ENTRY : THE CLIMB TODAY WE ARE FACED WITH ONE OF THE TOUGHEST DAYS OF THE RIDE-from Grand Junction to Delta , up and over Sidebar 10,500-foot Grand Mesa-90 miles and 7,000 vertical feet of climbing . Despite great memories of RTRs past , the thought , " Why am I here ? " springs to mind now and again . It 's hot and windy at the start , cold and snowy on top . As the climb steepens past Palisade , I fall in with a Cat 2 racer from New Jersey . * " What 's your low gear ? " he asks . I admit to a 39/25tooth . " All I have is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at the Mesa looming above . " Do you think it 's enough ? " Well-no , I do n't , but I do n't say that-I just smile encouragingly . On the first steep rise , he blows up spectacularly . " This is a lot tougher than a crit in Hoboken , " he gasps as he slows to an anaerobic crawl . And only 15 miles more of climbing to go . * Halfway up , BICYCLING Pro Advisory Team member Ron Kiefel and his wife , Eve Stephenson-Kiefel , ( see them on page 10 ) are climbing steadily , enjoying the scenery . We ride together to the top while Ron spins tales of his seven Tours de France . Eve has surely heard Ron 's war stories before but I have n't , and they make the climb magical . Considering the steep road lined with snowbanks , the dark timber and Kiefel climbing beside me , I could be in the Alps or the Pyrenees-a man of Le Tour , riding to the summit with a touch of Gallic hauteur .

Tight curves , rockfalls , waterfalls , blue columbine and squeaking marmots . On one of the switchbacks there 's a monument to snowplow drivers who died trying to keep the road open in winter . An avalanche , building momentum over 3,000 vertical feet from the summit of Mt . Abrams , swept the plow off the road and buried the drivers . * Dr. Z and I take turns relaying each other down the pass .
