Scott Bradfield published his first sf story while still a teen , but he is probably better known outside the sf field than within : his novels The History of Luminous Motion , Animal Planet , and What 's Wrong with America ! have garnered much acclaim in various literary circles , His edgy stories , many of which satirize modern life in California , have appeared in a wide variety of magazines and anthologies , including TriQuarterly , Interzone , Off Limits , and Conjunctions ; they have been collected in The Secret Life of Houses , Dream of the Wolf , and Greetings from Earth . Few writers at work today can rival Scott Bradfield 's mastery of the talking animal story ( or " Beast Fable " or " Animal Fantasy , " if you 're poking around in The Encyclopedia of Fantasy ) . His first story for us is one such tale , a skewed look at family matters courtesy of Dazzle the dog . If you 're curious about Dazzles first appearance , it was published in the anthology Other Edens II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DESPITE ALL THE BURRS and bad weather , Dazzle lived a good life in the woods . He ate plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables , learned to take one day at a time , and raised the gangly pups of his common-law wife Edwina with as much genuine affection as if they were his very own . There were times , however , when Dazzle found that being a decent father figure took more patience than he could muster . And no matter how hard he tried to restrain himself , he could n't stop telling everybody what to do . " No , no , no , " Dazzle told the twins for about the zillionth time that morning . " Let 's try it again , okay ? This is a rectangle . This is a rhomboid . And this is a circle . " Dazzle sketched the shapes in the powdery red dirt as he spoke them , trying to show the twins that geometry was as graspable as any bone , stick or rock . " Okay , Heckle , let 's pretend I 've sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down to the Land of Men and bring me a Frisbee . Have you got that , Heckle ? Do you know what a Frisbee is ? " Heckle , who had been warming his cold nose under the nippled convexity of sister jeckle 's gravid belly , sat up with a start . He licked his wet lips hungrily . " Just show me that Frisbee , " Heckle snapped . " I 'll whip that sucker out of the sky , no problem . " " Okay , boy , " Dazzle continued . " Now take a deep breath and look at the three shapes I 've drawn . And tell me - which one 's the shape of a Frisbee ? Show me the circle . The circle is the shape of a Frisbee . Point to the circle and you win the game . " Dazzle spoke evenly in short compact sentences , as if he were marking a trail with bright red beads . But no matter how clearly Dazzle pointed the way , Heckle never managed to keep up for very long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered out loud , mewling and starting to twitch . " But not a Frisbee , really ? A circle 's a space on the ground when a Frisbee 's not there ? So what the hell do I want with a circle , anyway ? Why ca n't I have a Frisbee instead ? " " You 're thinking too hard , Heckle , " Dazzle warned . " Relax , take a deep breath , and point to the circle . You can do it , boy . So do it for me now . " " This is not the Frisbee ! " Heckle declared with a pounce . " Here it 's not ! This is n't it here ! " Heckle was so slavery with confusion he looked as if he had just chewed a frog . Within moments he had pawed the rhomboid completely out of existence - both metaphorically and literally . Times like this Dazzle felt like wandering down to PCH and hurling himself under the first eighteen-wheeler that came along . " Not quite , Heckle , " Dazzle pronounced finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But at least you pointed to a geometric figure , and not a dead beetle like last time . So what say we sleep on it , and take another shot in the morning . As I 've told you before - Nietzsche 's Genealogy of Morals was n't written in one day . " " Maybe I 'm not all I should be in the Family Skills Department , " Dazzle confessed that night to his erstwhile mate , Edwina . " But getting through to those kids of yours is like having a conversation with a block of wood , I swear . If I try to instruct them in the most basic math and science skills , they 're not interested . If I try to teach them which way to look when crossing the street , they 're still not interested . If I try to point out the most obvious cultural contradictions of multinational capitalism , why , forget about it . They 're really not interested . If you ca n't eat it or fuck it , it 's not important , that 's their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off most ? They just may be right . Maybe fucking and eating really are the ne plus ultra of canine development . And in the long run of history , I 'm the biggest boob in town . " Dazzles mate Edwina was a pretty faithful bitch ( at least since menopause , anyway ) and had long provided Dazzle everything he considered crucial to a long-term relationship . She never questioned his judgment . She rarely bit him hard enough to draw blood . And she never once kicked him out of bed for snoring . At the same time , though , Edwina was n't the sort of dog who knew how to hold up her end of a conversation . In fact , whenever Dazzle started pouring out his most heartfelt anxieties , she promptly curled into a fetal ball and fell fast asleep . " Growwwl , " Edwina muttered , while the whites of her eyes flickered out the weird morse of dreams . " Wolves are n't welcome " round these parts . And neither are you mailmen . " Nevertheless , Dazzle found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edwina . Her ambient heat soothed the knots in his shoulders , and her inattention dissolved the perplexities in his brain . As a result , Dazzle awoke every morning filled with fresh intentions and resolve . " I 'm going to be more understanding and thoughtful , " Dazzle would assure himself , performing his ablutions in the piney-smelling creek . " And I wo n't be so quick to lose my temper , either . " But once Dazzle had shaken himself dry with a few soul-rattling shivers and climbed back up the flinty hill , his resolutions always vanished with the breeze . He saw his lazy foster progeny licking themselves around the extinguished campfire . He smelled the unburied heaps of sour bones and dead mice . And he heard the casual yips of random lovemaking fill the rough-hewn settlement with a sort of ambient hum . ( " Roll over , sweetheart , " or " You kids go chase a gopher or something . Mum and Dad need a little alone time dig ? " ) If there was one thing that really got Dazzles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best things in life for granted , such as liberty , well-stocked provisions , and properly functioning reproductive organs . Perhaps this was because Dazzle had to work hard making it possible for his extended-family members to never have to work too hard for themselves . Or perhaps it was because when Dazzle was little , a hasty vet lopped his balls off with a scalpel . " Come on , guys ! " Dazzle barked . " Wake up and smell the coffee , will you ? You ca n't lie around in your own filth all day , sniffing your smelly scrotums . Here , why do n't I show you grandpups how to build a fire , or gather blueberries , or even compose a sestina . I mean , what good is all this free time if you do n't know how to use it ? And you , Heckle , do n't try skulking into those bushes . I want you to sit down right this minute and draw me a parabola . You 're gon na learn your basic geometry , pal , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , DAZZLE got himself so wound up that none of the other dogs would talk to him . The males would n't sniff the trees he pissed on . The bitches would n't roll over submissively when he sauntered by for a chat . And even the chirpiest grandpups would n't sport playfully with him in the dewy grass , since they knew that even when Dazzle pretended to be fun-loving , he was almost always nursing yet another endless lecture on one of his favorite topics , such as " Why Dogs Should n't Eat Their Own Vomit , " or " How Will Humans Ever Respect Dogs If Dogs Never Respect Themselves ? " In fact , the only dog who could bear Dazzle 's company anymore was Edwina . And this was because Edwina never stayed awake long enough to figure out what Dazzle was trying to say . " I know I do n't talk much about my family , " Dazzle confessed to her one night in a whisper . " But maybe I should , since sometimes I feel it 's my dead history that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man had n't pissed off when I was born , I might have learned a little something about being a good dad myself . Instead , I 'm always trying to overcompensate . To be better , to act wiser , to prove myself more dependable and trustworthy than some guy I never knew . I guess what I 'm trying to say , honey , is that the ones who suffer most for my screwed-up family-history are the pups and grandpups . And they 're not even the ones I 'm mad at . The one I 'm really mad at is myself . " Over succeeding days and weeks , Dazzle tried counting to ten , positive thinking , and just plain walking away . But no matter how hard he tried to restrain himself , he could n't seem to go ten minutes without bossing his fellow dogs into a tizzy . Pretty soon the role of benevolent despot became as confining to Dazzle as any basement garage or backyard fence . And Dazzle , who could n't bear the notion that he might be denying anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to take another trip into the world . " Basically , " Dazzle told his assembled foster progeny on the day he departed for L.A. , " I want you guys to stick together until I get back . Try not to eat so much red meat , keep an eye on your crazy Mom , and do n't let the pups go wild on you . Jeckle , stop hanging with coyotes . Stan , if you took a bath every few days or so , that rash of yours would clear up , no problem . And if for some reason I do n't return from this ridiculous quest of mine , I want you all to know that I love you , and I 'm sorry if I 've been a temperamental old cuss the last few months or so , I guess there 're still a few things I need to figure out in my life , and if I do n't figure them out now , I probably never will . Oh , and one last thing . I 've hidden the Cheetos under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , will you - " But before Dazzle could deliver his final instructions , the entire assembled clan of fosterpups and grandpups took off in one shaggy collective flash . They did n't even pause long enough to woof good-bye . They just disappeared over the first low rise and were gone . Dazzle tried not to feel hurt or disappointed . Dogs , after all , were dogs . And by their very nature , dogs would do anything for a Chee-to . " Try to save a few till I get back , " Dazzle concluded softly through the swirling haze of dandruffy dog hairs . " Name-brand snack food does n't grow on trees . " " I guess I 'm what you 'd call your basic stay-at-home individual , " Dazzles dad confessed on the morning his estranged son appeared on his doorstep . " I like to sleep every night on the same blanket , make my daily rounds pissing on the same posts , and pretty much eat out of the same garbage cans every day of my existence . And with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I consider the high point of my life to be a really good bowel movement . Rock hard , intact , clean cut at both ends . I mean , what else is there ? Sure , I sowed my share of wild oats in my day . But now I just want to be left alone to my memories , my naps , and my unbelievably pleasurable flatulence . Which , by the way , brings me to my next point , Mr. Doozle . Or did you say your name was Dizzle ? " " Dazzle , " Dazzle replied weakly , trying not to look hurt . " Whatever . Way I look at it , see , is maybe you could step back from my doorway just a tad . And pardon my involuntary growl - it 's just I 've got this weird territorial thing about my front stoop . Not that I actually doubt your claim of kinship , mind you . But turn around slowly , that 's it , and keep your paws where I can see them .... " Times like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He felt embarrassed for his entire canine species . " Ah yes , " Dazzles dad said , sniffing around in his son 's private parts like a pig rooting out truffles . " That 's definitely a smell I recognize . And yes . That 's a smell I recognize , too . " " Things happened at the pound , Pop . You never gave me a chance to explain . " But of course it was already too late . Dazzles dad emitted an abrupt snort of amazement and fell back , plop , onto his gray flat haunches . His ice-cold nostrils flared . " Jesus Christ , son . Somebody 's chopped off your balls ! " Dazzle sighed with a sad little shiver . " Tell me about it , " Dazzle said . Pop invited Dazzle to spend the night in his sheltered alleyway outside a condemned Pizza Hut , and even offered to share some of his moldier blankets and food-stuffs . But he refused to acknowledge any moral responsibility for Dazzle 's life . Or manifest the slightest degree of remorse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pop said , " and that 's for you to make me feel bad about myself . Life 's a mess , whichever way you look at it , and us dogs got to do anything necessary to get by . Sometimes it means sucking up to human beings . Other times it means turning our backs on one another . In a better world , son , sure , I 'd have stuck around , taught you a few things , provided for you and your sisters the best I knew how . But the world does n't always allow us to do what we 're supposed to . Sometimes we have to settle for what we must do instead . " All his life , Dazzle had considered language a means of opening up new vistas . It came as quite a surprise , then , to learn how effectively it could be deployed as a form of embargo . Especially if you were as good at it as Dazzles dad . " So why did n't you keep an eye on us , Pop ? " Dazzle asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right down the street , living in a hole Mom dug behind the Lucky Market . All you had to do was walk down the street and say hello . " Dazzles dad issued sighs like exclamations . He was n't trying to make points , exactly . Instead , he was expressing the hard , breathy futility of saying anything at all . " Your morn did n't want me around , sport . It would only have upset her . " " But what about after Mom went away ? Why did n't you come visit then ? " " Because by that point you did n't want to see me anymore . And besides , I 'd taken up with this wild bitch from Vanowen . You would n't have wanted me to abandon my responsibilities to her , now , would you ? 11 Sometimes , when Dazzles inquiries grew a little bristly , Pop would shut off every avenue to discourse with a generic injunction . " No use rehashing the same refried beans , " Pop would say . Or even : " Why do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning . " Dazzle 's dad had grown so radically dissociated from his own feelings over the years that he did n't have any idea what terrible shape he was really in . He rarely bathed or picked up after himself . He ate nothing but day-old junk food foraged out of back alley bins . And he never listened to a single word anybody tried to tell him , especially if it might do him a world of good . Every morning Dazzles dad woke with the dawn , lapped dirty water from a blocked drain , and set off for his diurnal scrounge through the neighborhood alleyways . Meanwhile , Dazzle trailed along dutifully like a cynical Boswell . " Well , what have we here , " Dazzles dad would proudly proclaim , as if he had just discovered the Northwest Passage , or a cure for distemper . " Looks to me like a good-sized chunk of a **25;1626;TOOLONG , still with a few crispy fries attached to this melted cheese here , mmm . And if I remember correctly , son , you said we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Or : " Let 's face it . Dogs are stupid and human beings are n't . That 's why dogs live in ditches and eat garbage , and human beings live in classy homes , and can visit the McDonald 's drive-thru any damn time they please . I 'm not trying to blow my own trumpet , kid , but you and I are rocket scientists compared to your normal breed of dog . So complain all you want about my lousy child-rearing techniques . Without my brains , you 'd have ridden off with the first dogcatcher that came along with a biscuit . just like your poor stupid mom . " Or : " Let 's wander past this empty lot for a moment and see .. ah , there he is . Inside that sewer drain resides Mad Dingo Dog , most completely unreasonable animal creature I 've ever met . Best if you stay out of this neighborhood altogether , son . Lesson number one of urban living is do n't worry about the human beings . Instead , keep on the lookout for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could read and I could write , I 'd probably send you a letter much like the one you 're holding in your paws right now . Visiting Dad has turned out to be a total bummer . In fact , I 've never met anybody so shut down and disaffected in my entire life . All Dad does these days is eat chocolate donuts , sleep , and evade the local dogcatcher . I hope everything is okay with you and the kids . I 'd tell you to give everybody my love , but knowing dogs , I 'm pretty sure they 've completely forgotten me now that my rear is n't around to be sniffed . But despite my frequently cranky moods , I want you to know that I really miss my life with you out there in the woods . And I sincerely hope you 'll all still be there when I get back . Love , Dazzle Despite all his talk about free-thinking individualism , years of bad faith had worn Pop 's identity down to the nub . If he was n't ranting about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he hardly had enough energy left anymore to lick his own scrotum . There were times , in fact , when Dazzles dad lay motionless on the concrete floors of his apartment for hours , just staring morosely at the cobwebby pointillism of dead flies on the wall . " What 's bothering you , Pop ? " Dazzle would ask , testing his dad for movement the same way curious children poke dead rabbits in the road with a stick . " What are you thinking about ? Want to let me in on the big secret , huh ? " " Nothing at all , son . Nothing I ca n't deal with , anyway . " " Do n't you get lonely sometimes ? Locked up in your own head like that ? " " Life is something you get through one day at a time , son . Stiff upper lip and all that . " " Why do n't you try talking about it , Pop ? When I 'm feeling blue , I talk to Edwina and it helps . Even when she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Talking about things does n't make them better , " Dazzles dad replied simply , closing his eyes and scratching serenely behind one ear . " Now if you do n't mind , I think it 's time for my afternoon nap . " Some days Dazzle felt as if he were sniffing around the perimeter of a vast black moat filled with man-eating crocodiles . In the center of the moat stood a tall brooding castle , elaborate with Gothic figurines and hand-carved paraphernalia . Dazzle knew his dad was standing in the middle of this castle , waiting for someone to let him out . But it was impossible to let Dad out until Dad showed Dazzle the way in . Dazzles dad did n't seem to understand his predicament one bit . Then one afternoon Dazzle went for a lonely walk through the streets of his remote , blissless puppyhood . Fences , walls , garbage bins , stray auto parts , oil-stained asphalt , bricked-over windows and board-hammered doorways . So far as Dazzle could figure , the civilized world was filled with tacky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . It was kind of like being lost in a maze where all the avenues were rigged with electric wires - zap , zap . Every choice was a bad choice . And every bad choice led you to believe that it was all your fault . " Too much dualism , " Dazzle decided , " can drive anybody nuts . Even a fairly intelligent individual like Pop . " Eventually Dazzle found himself loitering outside the ramshackle , scanty hut of Dad 's weird neighbor , Mad Dingo Dog , and wondering if anybody was home . Dazzle was beginning to miss the company of other dogs , even if they were n't especially bright or loquacious . At least Edwina and the kids speak the truth as clearly as their crude tongues allow , Dazzle reflected fondly . But these shutdown alpha males like Pop , Jesus . Get me out of here . Dazzle was so mired in his own disconsolate reflections that he did n't even notice he was no longer alone . At first he felt hairs bristle on the nape of his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . Mad Dingo Dog had a warty , prolonged face , tufted with gray whiskers . He squinted at Dazzle for a moment . Then took a perfunctory sniff at the intervening air . " Why , I 'll be a pussy 's uncle , " Mad Dingo Dog exclaimed . " You smell just like my long lost nephew , Dazzle ! " THE WEIRD THING was , Dazzle never even knew he had an uncle . And yet from the moment they met , the two of them caught on like a house afire . " Yeah , " Mad Dingo Dog confessed , " your old man 's a real piece of work . But one thing 's for certain - he 's always been real proud of you . My son got himself out of this rat-race , " he 's always bragging . " My son was too good for this dump so he split . " My son this and my son that . " Jeez , the old fart never stops talking about you . So what are you doing back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had your own condo in the woods , soapy hot tub and everything . And you were running the world 's first all-canine high-tech retail outlet , or something crazy like that . " Hearing all this exaggerated gossip about himself made Dazzle feel meager by comparison . After all , Dazzle did n't want to talk about himself . Dazzle wanted to talk about him . " Maybe I misunderstood what Dad was trying to say , " Dazzle ventured after a while . " But the way Dad tells it , he and I are the only halfway  --  intelligent dogs on the entire planet . And you 're this crazy , rabid guy who howls at the moon , and keeps trying to steal all his best donuts.11 Mad Dingo Dog could n't help smiling . It resembled an allergic twitch . " Yeah , well , " Mad Dingo Dog concluded wistfully . " That certainly sounds like your old man , now , does n't it ? " By the time Dazzle returned to Dad 's condemned basement , he found a dogcatcher 's van parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning into Dad 's doorway with a Milk Bone dog biscuit . " Come here , old soldier , " the dogcatcher was saying , " and I 'll take you to the land of milk and honey . Free dog chow , plenty of furry friends to keep you company , and at the end of the day , a bonus injection of this really fine medication I 've put aside especially for you . No more loneliness , bud . No more wondering what it 's all about . So come along , boy , that 's a good dog , one more step , then another . Come get your dog biscuit . Then I 'll drive you to the pound and teach you what real peace is all about . " In back of the idling white van a mangy assortment of alley strays were scrambling all over one another trying to get out . They yelped and howled and woofed and barked . " Do n't listen to him , guy ! " an old gray bulldog cried , pawing the grated window . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disinfectant , and there are n't any decent places to go to the bathroom ! " Dazzle stood and contemplated this weird scenario fora moment . His dad , the dogcatcher , strays in a van , and the hot Encino sun staring implacably down . He could barely hear Dad 's whisper through the distant swish of traffic on 101 , but even so , it registered clearly in Dazzles brain . It was as if Dad were n't responding to the dogcatcher at all . He was simply telling his son what both of them needed to know . " I do n't want it to hurt , " Dad whispered . His voice approached the inner doorway of his hovel , but only his rubbery black nose peeped out . " I just want to go somewhere I do n't have to think or feel guilty . And where nothing that happens is ever my fault . " " We 'll give you oodles of peace and quiet , old boy , " the dogcatcher replied softly . He spoke with the glib confidence of a man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take you to a place where you do n't have to think about anything anymore . " " I thought I 'd leave my apartment to my son . I do n't think he wants me around anyway . I 'm not sure , but I think I 'm starting to get on his nerves . " " It 's time for the old to make way for the new , pal . You come with me and I 'll take care of everything . " For a brief moment , Dazzle thought Dad should make this particular decision for himself . But at the same time , being A radical civil libertarian , Dazzle could n't stand to see the public service sector impinging on anybody 's personal freedom . So without a second thought , Dazzle snuck over to the municipal-issue van , climbed into the driver 's seat , and activated the emergency door-release with his paw . Behind him in the crowded cabin , the hairy clamor ceased . Then , with a faint clang , the rear doors swung miraculously open . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulldog interposed . " But I 'm outta here . " Wild dogs poured from the back of the van like marbles from the mouth of a jar , ricocheting off one another in every direction . The dogcatcher was so startled that he dropped his dog biscuit and banged his knee on the curb . " Wait ! Stop ! Bad dog ! Bad dog ! " He was issuing shotgun proclamations and running down the alley . Eventually he turned the far corner and disappeared . " Bad dogs to you , maybe , " Dazzle responded softly , to nobody but himself . " But to my way of thinking , they 're just doing what dogs got ta do . " That night , after a lackluster celebratory bash of chocolate donuts and Diet Tab , Dazzle finally told his dissociative old dad the news . " I 'm sorry , Pop , " he said , " but I ca n't stand to see you do this to yourself anymore . I had these illusions , right , that maybe we 'd reach some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to the woods . But I now realize that you 're so tied up in your endless routines and bad faith that you 'll never let go . So what I 'll do , see , is tell your grandkids you died . I 'll tell them you sent your love , but that you rolled over and died shortly after I found you . I 'll tell them you got hit by a car , or developed lung cancer from the smog , or got shot in the butt by some spoiled kid with a BB gun . I 'll use you as an example , Pop , of what urban America can do to a dog , and if we 're lucky , maybe none of our semi-progeny will ever stumble into this hell-hole you ca n't seem to leave . I wo n't kiss you goodbye or anything , but just say thanks for your hospitality and get my poor frazzled butt out of here . If I start now , I can maybe hit Ventura by morning . " Dazzle finished having his say with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even angry or anything . I just had to tell him good-bye . Dazzles dad had been looking a little shaken since his encounter with the dogcatcher , and he sat watching his son with a slightly cocked expression , as if he heard tasty birds singing somewhere . Dazzle had a tear in his eye as he went to the door . Over one shoulder he wore a painstakingly adjusted backpack which contained a cheese sandwich , a stale jelly donut , and a half-liter bottle of Evian . " So what is it , Pop ? " Dazzle asked his father at the verge of the weedy doorway . " Am I taking off and you 've got nothing to say ? Do n't lose the moment , Pop . I 've lost a few moments in my life and I can promise you . You never get them back . " Dazzles dad considered . Then , for the first time in his life , he finally told his son what was really on his mind . " Grandkids ? " Dazzle 's dad said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his dad home to the high mountains , where they never exchanged any true , heartfelt words ever again . After all , there 's plenty of sunshine and fresh air to keep you occupied in the mountains . And sometimes talk just gets in the way of living . " I guess I 'll never be a perfect father , " Dazzle confessed to Edwina one night , gazing out at the sky littered with stars . " Or a perfect son , either , for that matter . And when I die , there may not be another dog in the entire world who knows how to light the evening fire , or record the day 's events for posterity . But history belongs to each generation to figure out for itself , so there 's no point in me getting all worked up about things I ca n't change . Sometimes , old girl , a dog needs to stop wrestling with the world long enough to get on with the simple fact of being . Like you and me , Edwina . Being together- nose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miraculous summer that Dazzle would remember fondly all his life . The pups grew progressively leaner , brighter and more independent . Brisk sea-winds kept the white sun cool . And wild wolves occasionally drifted into the orbit of their encampment , lured by aromas of toasted marshmallows and bitches in heat . It was a summer of perfect somnolence and irreflection . Except , of course , when it came to Dazzle 's immutable dad . " For crying out loud ! " Dazzles dad was often heard exclaiming through the warm , fir-scented air . " It 's a rhomboid , for Christ 's sake ! Do n't you idiots know what a rhomboid is ? " But of course it was one of the miracles of that particular summer that nobody ever figured out what a rhomboid was . Nobody even cared .
