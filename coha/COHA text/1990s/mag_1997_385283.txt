Chances are , you 'll never see the Los Angeles Lakers ' Shaquille O'Neal steal the shoes off a fan at a basketball game , then throw them at the free-throw shooter . And it 's highly unlikely Michael Jordan will ever grab a woman 's purse , shove it into the hands of his opponent , and dance down the court with him . Of course , Shaq and Michael are mere basketball players . Paul Gaffney is the Clown Prince of Basketball . He borrows shoes , purses and just about anything else from fans . He also throws water on the crowd , makes fun of the referee and fakes serious injuries two or three times a game . All with a smile on his face . The fans smile too . And they laugh . A lot . Because Paul Gaffney is a member of the Harlem Globetrotters . A History of Fun The Globetrotters mix basketball with laughs almost every night of the year at arenas from Rome , Ga. , to Rome , Italy . They 've done it for 70 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The original Trotters would be in their 90 's by now . ) The Globetrotters were dunking , passing behind their backs , dribbling between their legs and mugging for cameras before Shaq 's parents were born . Gaffney is the latest Clown Prince , a title given to the team 's lead prankster , joker and showman . Gaffney wears a microphone during games so the audience can hear his wisecracks . He has a lot of fun , and it shows . " When people come in here , they forget their troubles , " he says . " Everybody just becomes a kid . " Most sports news these days is about salaries , strikes or free agents . But the Globetrotters provide a time-travel journey to the good old days of sports . They have n't changed much in 70 years . To them , basketball is still a game , and kids are n't the only people who can have fun playing it . Funny , Yes . But Athletes Too When the Globetrotters played last year in Columbia , Mo. , dozens of eager kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than an hour before game time . When the doors opened , they rushed inside to get their first glimpses of the players . They were n't disappointed . With Gaffney leading the way , the Globetrotters had the fans laughing and clapping for two hours . They won , of course . They almost always do . In addition to being funny , they are good basketball players . Gaffney , however , does n't like the suggestion that he is half-athlete , half-entertainer. // <p>
