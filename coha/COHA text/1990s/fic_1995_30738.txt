Remedios La Curandera ( curandera , n.f. healer ) Remedios , la curandera , stands at the edge of the sea . The old healer is weary , a result , in part , of the countless times she has cocked her head in the direction of someone 's story . Remedios knows the town 's stories . Just as the sea , as their witness , knows them , too . Remedios looks out over the deep . Tucked under an arm is the swordfish beak that is one of her prized possessions . She has owned it for many years . Usually she keeps the sword in her hut , on her altar , la mesa santa . Not today . Today she has brought the sword to the sea because it signifies the waters and the mighty fish that live there . She has brought it because el pico de pez espada helps her find those who have drowned . Today Remedios awaits the one blue wave that will bring a corpse to shore . The body we wait for , she thinks , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea can not be rushed . The others wring their hands , hold their breaths on the far side of the crag , at the place where the river joins the sea . But not Remedios . El pico has led her to this spot , and it is here she 'll keep her vigil . Gathering her long dark skirt between her legs , Remedios squats on the shore . She lays el pico across her lap . Around her neck is the cord from which her medicine pouch hangs . The pouch rests directly over her heart and contains the secret talismans that fortify and empower her . Remedios spreads a palm over the little pouch , then reaches for the line of foamy brine rippling toward her . In the biting honesty of salt , the sea makes her secrets known to those who care to listen . She touches a fingerto her tongue and the stories come . The sea remembers . So it is the sea retells.                    @
