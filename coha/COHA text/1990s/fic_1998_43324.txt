CHARGED UP with high-voltage anger , Rabbi Steven Eskanazzi covers twenty-odd Manhattan blocks in nine minutes . He wants the anger full-strength , does n't want to lose any piece of it by putting it into words . He keeps an empty phrase going in his head : something must be done . Something must be done . A Jewish girl-same age as Steven , they 've known each other for years-falls in love with a German ; okay , that can happen . Then goes around flaunting the German in public , advertising her obsequious in-loveness ; disgusting . <p> He descends the concrete face of the warm , dirty city from his building in the mid-Eighties to Jackie 's on Sixty-fourth near Columbus Avenue as if he were shinnying down a rope : the forward pull is automatic and it takes energy to hold himself back , waiting for traffic at the corners . He jangles the coins in his pockets as the yellow Checker cabs pass before him , the Volkswagen Rabbits , the long Cadillacs escaped from the 60 's . He threads his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reading unintentionally the advertisements on their sides . <p> It 's April 13 , 1978 ; something must be done . He reaches the medium-sized , faded-yellow apartment house , goes in and examines the panel in the front lobby . J Bloch , 6K . Pushes the button . He 's panting and his throat is hot and raw . A harsh buzz ( the building 's mocking vulgar response ) and the door unlatches . Through the main lobby with its smell of dim-brownness and furniture polish to the creaky-old-man elevator for a slow ride up to six . He rings her doorbell . <p> " Well hell-o , do come in , what a truly gigantic pleasure . " As the door clicks shut he 's in a living room all in oatmeal ( the shag rug , the two small facing sofas ) with a framed poster , mainly purple , advertising the Joffrey Ballet , and the oatmeal curtains closed . Something 's wrong . The blood comes prickling to his face . He looks up and away . <p> " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would appear to be a man 's shirt , and that 's all . Sleeves rolled up , top buttons open . The biggest problem is her right leg sloping toward him as she stands with hips cocked , causing the universe to drain downward through some sort of hole in his mind , sand through a funnel . <p> " Why do n't you drop dead ? Did I invite you ? " Her every move causes him another jolt . He falls back a step and then another , moving along the wall toward the corner . " And now you 're gon na tell me how to dress ? What are you , king of the world ? Do I tell you how to dress ? - not that you could n't use a little help . " Lowered insinuating eyes , teasing . " Would you like a few suggestions ? Soft , sweet , and sexy , that 's the look-pink silk . Beige and gold . Calvin Klein . " He steps back again as she comes forward , then looks her in the face and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect from a grown Jewish woman ? Or any woman ? " <p> Oh , expletive modesty , she says . " I do n't happen to be a modest person . " And steps toward him again , causing another internal shimmering shudder like a cascade of wind chimes in a breeze . " And by the way , you are n't , either-we 're a lot closer than you think , I mean , a lot . " Another step , and she bursts out giggling as he retreats into the corner and says , " Stop it ! " <p> " We 're a lot closer than you 'd ever dream , " ignoring him . " I 've got cooties , right ? You ca n't touch me , right ? " The musical giggle-hands clasped behind her back , she advances again and stops inches away to look up at him . He 's slight but she 's smaller . He can smell the laundered cleanness of her shirt , her fragrant black hair . He can follow the quivering up-and-down of the improbable pendant on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , antique-looking . The thigh-grazing hem of the shirt rises as she gathers a bunch of hair and lets it feather back into place . Acuteness of the bend at her elbow and again at the wrist . " But then of course you are the most arrogant stuck-up person I ever met , and that 's got something to do with modesty too , do n't you think ? Mister big-shot who barges into girls ' apartments and tells ' em how to dress ? Mister modesty police ? Do n't you think ? " <p> ALTHOUGH HE is a rabbi and an Orthodox Jew he has never ( in fact ) taken seriously the risk of incurring ritual uncleanness when you touch a woman . When you 're unclean , you can always get clean again . Private sessions between unmarried persons of the opposite sex are themselves unlawful , but he has in mind the components out of which you could assemble a theological justification : states of emergency , obligations to prevent sin . <p> He steps past her , returning to the vicinity of the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about to speak . " What can I do for you , Stevie ? " Shaking her head at him with arms crossed , mock reproach . " What do you want to tell me , Stevie ? " Shaping each word with her lips . Her energy is so high it drives her from mood to mood faster than he can follow . <p> " I only came for one reason , " fighting for concentration . " Because you think that , whatever you do , no one 's ever going to tell you no . No , you ca n't do it . No , you ca n't have it . No , that 's not right . No one , ever , has ever told you no , " gathering speed and resentment , " and that 's why you 're a spoiled brat in a generation , a whole generation of spoiled brats , in a whole country of spoiled brats . Lord help us when you grow up and take over , because the only word you 've ever heard in your whole life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm here to tell you no . Your behavior stinks . Your behavior with Klaus stinks . Your behavior is disgraceful . And good-bye , I 'm leaving . " Hand on the doorknob . <p> " Liar . You 're lying , are n't you ? " Quietly . " You 're here because you want to grab me and make love . " " Sex , you think sex- " <p> " But you 're too scared to admit it , including to yourself . " <p> " Sex , you think , is the only thing in the world , do n't you ? " <p> " It 's the only thing on your mind anyway , right at the moment . " <p> " Sure , fine , sure , I 'm a human being , I 'm a man , but life does n't reduce to hormones . " She 's approaching again , graceful , toe-out ballet steps , step and pause , step and pause , working hard to keep from laughing . <p> " How would you know ? " Another deliberate small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " step , " than a five-year-old , do you ? " He 's looking tensely around the room but stands his ground . <p> " Do you ? Huh ? Do you ? You 're so transparent . It upsets you , does n't it ? " <p> " You want me to give in because you 're irresistible . I know you are . It 's true , you are . I 'm still telling you no . No , get it ? No ! And I 'm leaving . " <p> " You are not . " <p> " Stop it , stand still . Stop it ! " " Make me . " <p> One instant before she plows into him he seizes her by the upper arms , holding her motionless with his own arms rigid and hard . She squirms , he holds on . " You 're hurting me , you 're doing it on purpose . You 're enjoying it-every man is a sadist , go ahead , lie to me , tell me I 'm wrong , tell me another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his grasp not to feel her , or squeeze her arms-directing his thoughts to the heavy punching bag in his high-school gym , which must have weighed about what she does . It was covered in blue vinyl and patched with duct tape . Thick heavy vinyl . A mental effort so intense , her words register only after the fact : " Squeeze harder , hurt me , that 's what you want , you do n't have the guts- " <p> " Yechhhhh , " his face screwed up , " you are revolting . " He 's pushed her away and she springs back and bursts out laughing , " You look just like a little kid when you say yech ! " <p> " Why do you talk garbage ? " He pulls the door open with a whoosh ; the breeze bats them , the airless heavy smell of the hall . <p> " Garbage . You wish . You do n't like it so it 's garbage , ' cause you 're too much of a coward to tell the truth . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion ? " His words pick up a hollowed  --  out sound from the hallway . <p> " Would n't you like to know . " <p> " Good-bye and good luck . " <p> " Coward . That 's your motto : no . No ! " She slams the door with a supple foot ( her leg grazes his ) and scoots around to lean against it . He backs off again . " That 's perfect , you uptight self-righteous creepy male chauvinist pig , that 's exactly , that's- " <p> " Spare me the- " <p> " The whole country . " <p> " Spare me the cliches- " <p> " That 's just what 's wrong with it . You want to know ? You want to know what 'll happen when we do take over ? I 'll tell you what , " low-volume screaming but with laughter running underneath , " instead of no there 'll be yes , and people- " <p> " You 're talking like a child- " <p> " Will be happy for once instead of all screwed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't just romp in the field and run around screaming . Children , yes , hate to hear the word no , " accelerating in a runway  --  rush to keep her quiet , " hate to find out there 's more to life than having fun , hate for anyone to cramp their styles and tell them sorry , you ca n't have that , and all you 're telling me is you want to be a child forever , that 's your motto , and it 's pathetic . " <p> " PATHETIC ? I 'LL tell you pathetic . Pathetic is going crazy because you want to make love to a girl , " only she puts it more concisely , " and she 's standing right in front of you and you have n't got the basic elementary guts , that 's pathetic . No to everything , that 's pathetic , no to sex , no to freedom , no to grass , no to liberation . Yes to nuclear weapons , huh , right ? Nuke ' em , right ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's your program- " <p> " You are nuts . " <p> " That 's it , yes to racism , and putting people down , and telling girls how to dress , that 's pathetic , coward . And when we do take over , the world will be different . " He 's backing away again as ( chest heaving ) she approaches . " Because you 'll be allowed , when there 's something and you want to do it , and it does n't hurt anybody , and the only reason not to do it is because of someone 's stupid religion , or stupid laws , or stupid rules , then you 'll do it , and the hell with all that uptight garbage , and people will be happy , and even you " ( bopping him smartly on the head with a rolled-up Time she 's grabbed off a sofa ) " wo n't be able to stop them ! " The Travolta Fever issue . " Coward ! " <p> The idea flashes through him of running his hands up her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( " He has raised discomania to a national craze , " Time reports . ) " Kindergarten society , " he says . " Permanent kindergarten . " <p> She hits him again . " Coward . " And again . With a lunge he grabs her wrists , gathers them in his right hand and clamps tight as the magazine falls with a soft smack to the floor and she looks up at him and laughs , breathless ; squirms hard , shoulders twisting , breasts moving inside the loose shirt . His heart punching . <p> " Okay , you got me . " Subsiding ; a quick flick of her head to toss stray hair off her face . " Go ahead , I 'm listening , make me religious . " " Drop dead . " <p> " Convince me God cares . I 'm waiting . Convince me God cares what Steven Eskanazzi eats for breakfast . Little Stevie Eskanazzi . You eat bacon , you ruin His whole day-right ? " With a yank on " right , " she pulls free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , panting , pushing hair off her forehead . " Okay , I 'm waiting , make me religious . " <p> " I ca n't , wo n't talk about it , not possible , not decent and not right with a half-naked woman in front of me . " <p> " Then do something about it ! " Panted shout . " Has anyone ever told you how to be a man ? Or only a Few ? " He 's clutching his clipped-on yarmulke and the hair beneath it , scanning the room . " Do you know you 're tearing your hair ? It 's sweet " - he thrusts his hands in his pockets- " I 've never actually seen that before . " <p> " I 'd hit you if you were n't a girl , it would be a pleasure . " <p> " Big strong man , hit me anyway . You 're the girl . " He has her wrists again and holds them before his face in his laced-together hands and just barely smiles . " All right , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of me . This the first time you 've smiled in twenty years ? " She yanks backward but ca n't free herself . " Let . . . , " squirming . " Having fun , rabbi ? " <p> He lets go and steps back quickly . " G'bye . " <p> " Tell me , Stevie , please . Tell me . " Instant change of tone as she slips once again between him and the door . She 's two inches away , whispering sweetly . " Tell me . Please ? I 'm a human being , too . Really , I 'm a human being , too . " Delicately pushing another hair back in place . He winces again and turns away : the cascading shudder , the wind chimes , the avalanche . " Girls are human beings . Even if you can see their legs , they still are . I know it 's hard to grasp . I can understand English . Honestly . I know you think I 'm a twit ... " . <p> " I do n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do . " <p> " Tell me , please ? " <p> HE PULLS the front door open again , another sucking whoosh , forcing her to step nimbly aside-and pauses with his hand on the knob . <p> " Here is the whole Torah . Try saying no to yourself for once . Consider that you might be wrong . If you take care of your family , the rest of the world will take care of itself . I said if And the rest is commentary . And goodbye . " <p> " I do n't think I get it . Explain it again . " <p> " You want to understand religion ? I 'm giving a talk in a synagogue five minutes from here this Saturday morning . Beit Shlomo . For your sake I 'll rewrite the whole thing . You want to know about religion , show up and listen , be my guest . " <p> " I 'll be there . Yes , I 'm coming . I 'll be there . Do n't give me that like totally astonished look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , I can understand lectures , and if Libbie is so damned crazy about you , why does n't she go hear you ? ' Cause she 's too damned scared to go . She 's scared to breathe . She 's scared of her own face . You both think I 'm scum , that I 'm a twit and scum , but what you are is cowards . " <p> " Do n't talk to me about your cousin . You are n't even fit to say her name , if you want to know the truth . " <p> " Are you in love with her , too ? Or just me ? " He 's out the door and smacks the elevator-call button ( across the hall and one door down ) . It rolls majestically open-just where he left it . She 's put her head out and sings mockingly into the flat hollowness of the hall : " Ogni donna mi fa palpitar-un desio cb ' io non posso spiegar , un desio .... " <p> He stops halfway into the elevator , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nuzzles him and retreats . " It amazes you , does n't it-a twit like me singing Mozart . My voice is n't bad , is it ? Not that you 'd know the difference . I studied singing ; but you 're the one who has no idea what I 'm singing . I 'm the twit , but you 're the one who knows zero . " He stands frozen , the door nuzzles him again . " Every lady , " singing and taunting , " makes me palpitate-a desire I ca n't explain . ... " He steps in without looking back , smashes the aL " button and hears her " See you Saturday ! " as the door closes . Riding down , he says out loud , " I think I lost . " <p> In the empty lobby he stops still and stares at his feet . What is this ? A hurricane roaring around inside him . He pushes out the door and walks uptown as fast as if something were chasing him . The quivering pendant . Her astonishing narrowness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her elbow and her wrist . Dodging uptown through the basso honks , barks , and mutterings of the city , the occasional hollow shriek of a cab rounding a corner , carrying his burden of confusion like a tottering stack of packages in his arms , cutting him off from the world-awkward , conspicuous , wholly self-absorbed . <p> " I THOUGHT , " he tells his roommate Rafi soon afterward , " boy meets girl , it 's supposed to be like , what , romantic or something . In fact it 's a wind tunnel , it 's like walking across the Long Island Expressway . " <p> Rafi is sitting in his bathrobe at the kitchen table with tea and a volume of the Talmud and his portable radio tuned to news . John Wayne is seventy , feels fine . Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Joan Mondale want to save Grand Central Station . John Mitchell is out of jail on furlough for medical treatment . Ehrlichman to be released soon . Patty Hearst freed temporarily , pending appeal ; fourteen months to serve . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daze . Bianca Jagger is doing something , and so is Margaux Hemingway , and so is Amy Carter , age ten . <p> " A wind tunnel . I thought in some sense the male was supposed to be the stronger party . So why am I shaking like a leaf ? " <p> Rafi switches off the radio and glances up . " You 're not . " <p> " I was . " Standing at the sink with an empty glass in one hand and his other on the faucet , stiff and staring . " What the hell ? What the hell is this ? " Rafi had been worried about the meeting , but it had n't lasted long and it was clear ( though Steven sounded strange-a musical instrument out of range , tense and pale ) that nothing had happened . <p> " Lust is strong . So what else is new ? " He quotes from the Mishnah in Hebrew : " Who is powerful ? He who masters his sex-drive . " <p> " Something is new . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has been , shall be . He continues in Hebrew , " and what has been done shall be done . And there is nothing new under the sun . " <p> " Something is new . " <p> " Tell me another one . " <p> A few minutes later Steven says , " I 'm not denying she 's beautiful . " <p> " Oh . Who asked you to ? " Rafi closes the Talmud , kisses it , and tucks it under his arm . " I 'm going to sleep . " <p> " You think , " motionless over the sink , one hand still resting on the faucet , " that it 's possible Libbie Bloch is , quote , crazy about me ? " <p> " I do n't know . Really would n't know . She 's a nice girl , you 're a nice guy , why not ? " Pause , standing . " Is this a trick question ? " <p> Another pause . " She 's not frum . " Is n't Orthodox , does n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ? Who 's beautiful ? " <p> Steven does n't hear . Rafi returns ten minutes later to go through a pile of magazines on the floor , Steven sitting at the table now with a glass of water . " In ten minutes , " says Rafi , " you made it from the sink to the table . Huh . " Working through the magazines . " Drink your water . C'm on . Drink it . " <p> Steven needs quantities of water for his health . Kidney disease kept him out of the Army during Vietnam . " You know why people behave right , do mitzvos , act in the correct way ? Habit . Just habit . Mitzvah goreres mitzvah . " One good act induces another . " If I 'd ever attacked a girl before , I would have attacked another girl tonight . The only reason I did n't is , I never had . I had my record to protect . Or something . I think.n Trailing off . <p> " That 's a nice explanation , " says Rafi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except it neglects one minor little thing , that some people act good because they are good . " <p> " I would n't know about that . " Silence . Then he adds , " I guess Libbie Bloch is good . " <p> Miss ELISABETH BLOCH , startled out of near  --  sleep by her bedside phone , groggily picks up . " What do you wear to synagogue on a Saturday morning ? " <p> " Jackie ? " <p> " Expert advice , the straight scoop . My guess is , the slit skirts wo n't fly . Correct ? That 's just like my-y'know-female intuition . " <p> Libbie is lying on top of her bedspread and it 's 10:45 P.M. She had been watching her thoughts wheel and tumble near the ceiling like winged putti in a luminous Titian haze . Thoughts about Steven , originally . Roughly an hour ago , on the telephone , she 'd had her first-ever intimate conversation with him ; at least , intimate sort-of , in a manner of speaking . Then he 'd set out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . But soon after , the glow of their conversation had returned . The small suburban bedroom , her childhood bedroom gone rose-and-golden in the dim warm light of her bedside lamp-the pink flowers studding the wallpaper turned it into a jewel box and she was inside , and then she was walking on some sort of balcony looking down into a large bright noisy room full of flowers , except that she had to go because she needed a cab , and then the phone rang . " What are you talking about ? " <p> " Gee , what am I talking about ? What 's so complicated ? Did I wake you , I 'm sorry . I just want to know . I 'm going to synagogue Saturday morning to hear Stevie give a lecture . Or something . Some kind of speech . You ought to be , like , falling on the floor with happiness , right ? I 'm going to synagogue . Me ? The girl who has n't been inside one since she was six ? I think-something like six . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't you go get him ? " Silence . <p> " It 's not like I have n't always known you wanted him . Obviously you 've followed him around like a puppy-dog for decades . But honestly it just hit me tonight that you really are crazy about him and it 's not just a little-girl crush-so what is it with you , why do n't you just do it ? " <p> " He would never marry a non-Orthodox girl . " <p> " Well , fine , you 're pretty Orthodox . " <p> " Do n't be a moron , you know what I mean . My synagogue , the school where I teach , they 're Conservative , and not very Conservative , more like Reform . I do n't keep kosher and so forth . As you know perfectly well . " <p> " Well , you do n't eat ham sandwiches , or even shrimp . I practically never heard of a girl so fantastically religious she does n't even eat shrimp . " Silence . They both know exactly what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from France , taught them all about it . When the grandmother died ten years ago , the grandfather returned with misgivings to his ancestral village outside Paris . He writes Libbie once a week , and she writes him back . <p> " So get Orthodox ! " <p> " You do n't change your religious practices to get a man , that would be dishonest , and everyone would see right through it . He would , obviously , and everyone else , too-it would n't even work , and anyway you would n't do it , because it would be insincere . It would be really low . It would be unprincipled and everyone knows that . Anyway I know it . Everyone knows it . And Orthodox Judaism-the position of women in Orthodox Judaism is no good . I mean , yes , they say they 're happy , and I do n't deny that Grandma really was happy . Yes , they 're treated with dignity and respect and all that , and their role is in a sense the central one . But obviously they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't tell you how devastated my mom and dad would be . It 's not an issue , because it 's a thing you would n't do , on principle . But my parents , Lord , it would be-they would be crushed , it would be nearly as bad as marrying a goy , maybe worse in a way , depending on the goy . For me to tell them I was turning Orthodox and marrying an Orthodox Jew ? It would be back-to-the-ghetto time , you know that perfectly well , they would be mortified . I mean , mortified . They 'd be shattered . But you could n't do it , I mean , on principle . It 's not an option . It 's not a thing you could do . And the thing is , he would n't marry me anyway . " <p> " Okay , fine . Loser . Quitter . Just tell me what to wear on Saturday morning . " <p> For a moment she says nothing . Then in a soft dignified voice : " You do n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read you loud and clear , Miss Passive-Pure-and-Sweet . Let him come to me . It wo n't work any more , it 's 1978 , remember ? That romance crap is gone , where you sit on your rear end like a potted plant and get picked out . And thank God it is . You 're relieved , are n't you ? You were a feminist before I was ! " " Sure I 'm relieved . " <p> " I do n't want to hurt your feelings but you are getting , sort of , y'know , weirder and weirder-but you taught me feminism ! You are relieved ? " <p> " I just told you I am . Of course I am . " <p> Two HOURS later Steven has finally concluded he is not going to fall asleep . He stands on his bed , then hops softly to the ground , puts on a bathrobe , goes to the living room . Pulls the large , worn humash from the bookcase and lays it open on the kitchen table . Turns to the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss in his lecture on Saturday . Merely looking at the pages of this Hebrew Bible lofts his mood into a distant key , comfortable but majestic . He knows the text by heart , starts to read and then ( following the ancient markings ) to sing quietly aloud . He continues way past the end of the section he had picked out . <p> Eventually his eyes are dry and tired and his neck hurts . He stops . The refrigerator cycles on : a big moment in the night silence . It cycles off . That long-ago afternoon when he and Jackie were teenagers and she almost seduced him but he ran out on her is still the major event of his life , dividing his memory in two . Idling beside the propped-open kitchen window he registers the occasional car swishing past , three stories below . The weary haul of a truck . The pantomiming traffic lights . In deep night , mere things can turn vaguely alien and untrustworthy , a cluster of crows eyeing you-the toaster , coffee maker , phone on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a prowling cat and leave you blankly staring . Something is bothering him even beyond Libbie and Jackie and the near  --  seduction of ten years ago , a tone coloring his thoughts like an offstage clarinet , not happy but not sad . He ca n't quite pull the memory into focus . <p> Toward three , a random house-noise wakes Libbie . Guilt and worry surge through the smallest crack in her sleep-she 's always been that way . She lies uneasily awake . Where did the phrase come from ? Did Jackie use it once to taunt her ? Did her dreams concoct it : the virgin feminist ? <p> Words and thoughts get stuck in her head , particularly ones that make her unhappy . She once mentioned this tendency to one of her endless line of unsatisfactory boyfriends , a scrawny medical student who had explained to her over dessert in a fancy midtown restaurant ( candle flames echoing off silver ) what the tendency meant : that she was suffering from an obsessive-compulsive disorder . " A classic presentation , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( first smoothing the trousers ) so she could be exposed to the full weight of his medical authority . He stretched an arm forward to tap his teaspoon on the saucer , enjoying the clink . Enjoying everything . " Of course , I do n't want to claim expertise in psychiatry , though I do know a little . " A quiet smile . " But , bottom line : I would definitely seek treatment . " A final definitive tap of the spoon . <p> She had known him in high school . Then he had become a colorless hard worker at a medium-grade college near Boston , and now he wore his medical  --  studenthood draped round him like the imperial purple . I would definitely seek treatment . ( Clink . ) <p> It makes her smile . At length she is asleep again . <p> Her cousin Jackie sleeps soundly . The sleep of victory-seamless , smooth , and sleek . Her life and her times are satin on her cheek . <p> Footnote            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
