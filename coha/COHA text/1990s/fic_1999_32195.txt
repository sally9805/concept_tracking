Memory Is Like a Watchacallit No shit , there I was .... We 'd been cut up so many ways and so many times we hardly had a skirmish line , and the enemy kept getting reinforced . I , like the rest of the outfit , was exhausted and terrified from swords buzzing past my ear and various sorts of sorceries going " whoosh " over my head , or maybe it was the other way around ; and there were dead people moaning and writhing on the ground , and wounded people lying still , and that was almost certainly the other way around , but I 'm giving it to you as I remember it , though I know my memory sometimes plays tricks on me . More on that in a second . First , I have to ask you to excuse me for starting in the middle , but that 's more or less where it starts . So there I was , in a full-scale battle ; that is , in a place where no self-respecting assassin ought to be . Worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was on the losing side , at least in this part of the engagement . I stood on Dorian 's Hill , with the Wall about two hundred yards behind me , and the Tomb ( which is not a tomb , and never was , and ought not to be called that ) about a quarter of a mile to my left . I wanted to teleport out , or at least run , but I could n't because , well , I just could n't . I had a sword , and I carried enough other weaponry to outfit half of Cropper Company ( my unit , hurrah hurrah ) . In front of us was The Enemy , getting closer with each step , and looking like this time they meant to stay . There were so many of them , and all I could think ofwas , " If they want this damned hill so badly , let them have it , " but I knew that was wrong , and certainly my messmates would have argued with the sentiment ; we 'd worked hard enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( And we had failed . So why did we now occupy the hill ? I do n't know ; they do n't explain these things to foot soldiers . ) Then , as if that was n't bad enough , I heard the rip of the juice-drum playing " Time To Be Alive , " which meant to form up for a charge . I guessed the Captain had decided we were n't strong enough to defend , or else he wanted to go out in a blaze of glory . I do n't know : it seemed to me that if you already had the high ground , why waste it by charging ? I wanted to call him an idiot but I knew he was n't . I relaxed my grip on my sword and took the requisite Three Deep Breaths as he positioned himself in front of us . I found myself right next to Dunn , the alternate bannerman , which put my life expectancy at just marginally above his , and his was just about the same as the bannerman , and hers was mathematically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted the job ; now they had it . The Captain gave no speeches this time ; I guess he 'd said everything he had to say over the last couple of days . He gave the signal that started us moving forward . As before , I discovered that I was moving , although I do n't remember ever deciding to ; I wondered , as I had several times before , if there was some sort of subtle magic involved , but I do n't think so . I recall that I really , really , really wanted to bolt , but I still could n't , so of course I did the only thing I could : I started praying . It was far too late for that , however , and nothing happened . Or maybe something did ; I 'm not sure . Oh yeah , I was going to talk about memory . Maybe memory is where it starts . I do n't know where it starts ; that 's part of why I 'm doing this , hoping to put it together and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , the gold ingots are a bigger part of why I 'm doing this . Where was I ? Right , memory . I woke up one morning remembering something I 'd forgotten the day before . I 'd been having a one-sided conversation with a metal box , much as I 'm doing now , in exchange for a good sum of raw gold and various useful oddities and trinkets , and I 'd felt like I 'd fulfilled my part of the bargain , but then , the morning after I finished , I realized what I 'd forgotten , and my first thought was that someone had been playing with my memories . My second thought was that , if this were true , I was going to hurt someone . My third thought was to consider , if someone was repressing my memories , who that someone had to be . This was chilling , and it brought me fully awake , which led to one of those irritating sessions of " How much was a dream ? " After several minutes I had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loiosh , my familiar , was just stirring . He gave his bat-like wings one lazy flap , hissed at me sleepily , and said , " How ' bout something to eat ? " into my mind . I said , " Do you remember Deathgate Falls ? " " No , I 'm senile . Of course I remember " " As you approach the Falls , do you remember there being a large statue ? " " Sure , Boss . Where Morrolan performed that embarrassing ritual . What about it ? " " Nothing . " Right . The ritual . I had forgotten that , too . I hate having disturbing thoughts before breakfast . I hate having thoughts before breakfast . " Is it important , Boss ? " " Let it go , Loiosh . " That was then , and it illustrates what a tricky thing memory is : I had forgotten something important that had happened just days before , yet now , more than three years later , I remember waking up and talking to Loiosh about it . Interesting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , you odd , shiny contraption with presumed ears at both ends , confused about who and what I am , and generally what I 'm on about . Okay . I 'll let you stay confused a little longer , and if you do n't trust me to clear everything up , then you can go hang . I 've been paid . I whipped up a quick omelet , ate it , and washed up , considering whether to ask someone about my odd memory lapse . I 'd made two acquaintances recently who might know , but I felt loath to ask them ; something about expressing weakness , I suppose . But it bothered me . I was still thinking about it when I finished donning my Jhereg colors ( grey and black , if you 're taking notes ) and making sure my various weapons were in place ; after which I stepped out onto the street I all but owned . I do n't usually travel with a bodyguard . For one thing , it would be hard to find anyone who could give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm not important enough to be a real threat to anyone ; and for yet another , it 's humiliating . I know that to some in the Organization the number of bodyguards is a status symbol , but to me they are only an irritation . But I 'm different . I was n't born into the Organization . I was n't even born into House Jhereg . In fact , I was n't born a citizen ; I 'm human . They are n't . This is enough of a difference that it can explain all others . So you can look around as I did . See the Teckla running around like the small rodents they are named for , doing things they think are important , selecting fruits at the fruit stands or pieces of fabric from the weavers , laying a bet with the local bookmaker , rushing to work in a garden or at a weaver 's , and , directly or indirectly , feeding me . See the Chreotha or the Jhegaala , with titles of the nobility but lives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or trying to get a bargain from the local fence and , directly or indirectly , feeding me . And , rarest of all , see the nobles themselves , strutting about like Issola in spring , scattering pennies to the paupers , having servants buy select wines and the more exotic brain-drugs , and , directly or indirectly , feeding me . It 's surprising that I stay so thin . None of them gave me any special regard as I strolled by for another day of extracting from them everything I could . I like it that way . The walk from flat to office was short , yet it was enough time for me to get a feel for what was going on in the neighborhood ; on that day there was nothing worth notingnot the least clue , as it were , of the events that had already been set in motion . I arrived , as I recall , early that day . The Jhereg operates all day , but the real action is mostly at night , so things get started correspondingly late ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived before my secretary , hung my cloak on the cloak-rack , set my rapier against the wall , and sat down at my desk to see what , if any , correspondence had arrived during the morning . There was one item : a piece of expensive parchment sat in the middle of my desk ; on it , in a neat , elegant hand , was written , " V. Taltos , Baronet . " I picked it up and inspected the back , which showed a Dragonshead seal . I set it down again and considered before opening it . I may have been a bit afraid of what it would say . No , I most certainly was afraid of what it would say . I picked it up and broke the seal before Loiosh could start on me . Baronet It would give me great pleasure to see you again . It may also prove profitable for you . If you would like assistance in transportation , you may inquire of Baron Lokran e'Terics at the House of the Dragon . Arrive today between noon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you at once . I Remain , my dear sir , Cordially Morrolan e'Drien P.S. : You expressed a preference for a formal invitation over our last method of asking for your help ; I hope this meets with your approvalM . I set the letter down again and thought about many things . As always when dealing with Morrolan , I did n't know how to take him . He calls his home Castle Black , which is either pretentious to the point of being silly , or a just and reasonable statement of his power ; take your pick . He was unusualperhaps " unique " would be a better wordin that he was a Dragaeran , and a Dragonlord no less , who studied Eastern witchcraft , which either showed that he did not share his compatriots attitude toward humans , or showed that he was so contemptuous of us that he could offhandedly learn our secret arts ; take your pick . The " last method " he referred to had been offensive enough that we had almost killed each other over it , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace offering ; take your pick . However , it never occurred to me not to accept his invitation . " We re going to Castle Black , Loiosh . " " I can hardly , wait , Boss . When ? " I consulted the Imperial Orb through my psychic link . It was less than ah hour before noon . " Now , " I told him . I strapped my rapier back on , not terribly reassured by its weight hanging at my side and the scabbard 's tapping against my leg . Melestav , my secretary , was just arriving . He seemed startled to see me . I said , " I have an errand . If you never see me again , blame Morrolan of the House of the Dragon . See you . " I stepped back out onto the streetthe first steps , as it were , that began the journey that led me toward war and death . I hired a cabriolet to cut down on the number of actual steps involved . I gave the runner no particular attention , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something . The House of the Dragon faces the Imperial Palace , just a bit west of north , and is marked by a forty-foot-high marble likeness of Kieron the Conqueror holding his greatsword in one hand , its point off to the East ; seeing it makes my arm tired . There is no discernible expression on Kieron 's face ; at least from below . There are ( surprise surprise ) seventeen steps up to the doors , which were standing open when I arrived , a bit footsore , just about noon . When you enter the House of the Dragon , you are in the Great Hall , a vast , huge , booming , echoing place with murals on the walls depicting violence , skinny windows that do n't let much light in , a marble floor , a single , very wide stairway planted in the middle of the Hall and running up out of sight , and many tiny hanging lamps way , way up on the ceiling where they do no good at all and probably require levitation to service ; yet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of how they actually illuminate the place . I did n't much care for it . I had n't been surrounded by so many Dragonlords since I was arrested after the death of my previous boss , and I did n't like this a lot more than I liked that . They Were standing in groups and were all of them armed . They were talking quietly , I suppose , but the place echoed horribly so it seemed awash with noise . There was grey bunting draped here and there , which meant that someone had died . I stood there like an idiot for a long , long timesay half a minutewith Loiosh on my shoulder , and then noticed a pair of sentries , on either of side the doorthat is , either side of meand observed that they were staring at me with decidedly unfriendly expressions . This made me feel much more comfortable , because I 'd rather be hated than ignored . I approached the man because the height of the woman . would have put my eyes at breast-level and this did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put some jaunt into my step because Dragonlords , like many wild animals , can smell fear . He looked down at me ( my eyes were level with his collar bone ) and kept his eyes away from Loiosh ; he probably thought I 'd get too much satisfaction out of seeing him react to the Jhereg on my shoulder , and he was right . I said , " I seek Baron Lokran . " The Dragonlord swallowed , clenched his jaw , and said , " Who are you ? " I thought about making an issue of the question , but I did n't know the protocol and I did n't like the odds . " Vladimir Taltos of House Jhereg , on an errand for Lord Morrolan e'Drien . " That should shut him up . It did . " Up the stairs , straight back , last door on the left . Clap and enter . " I sketched a bow , resisting the temptation to make it over-elaborate . " What are you afraid of , Boss ? " " Shut up , Loiosh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort , making it a challenge to climb casually with , I assumed , the eyes of the two Dragonlords on my back . I managed as best I could . My footsteps echoed , and the stairway went on for much too long . When I finally reached the top I walked straight back to the end of a hallway longer than the building that houses my entire operation . It ended in a large door which I ignored ; instead stopping at the one to my left , as directed . One clap and I entered . Lokran turned ; he had , apparently , been staring out the window . He was young , with bright eyes , and had a faded white scar above his browsthe scar obviously had some sort of sentimental value for him or he 'd have had it removed . His hair was dark , straight , and brushed back in almost a Jhereg-cut . He had rings on four fingers of each hand , and the rings all had jewels in them . The room held four stuffed chairs , a sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the window . Three or four short , black staves were leaning against the far wall , and a heavy sword in a black sheath stood next to them . His eyes narrowed briefly when I entered , then he said , " Taltos ? " pronouncing it correctly . I bowed and said , " Lokran ? " He nodded . " Come a little closer . " I did . He gestured casually in my direction , as if he were brushing away an insect , and my bowels twisted , and I was in the courtyard of Castle Black , standing , as far as I could tell , on thin air that felt like a hard surface , say flagstones , but looked like nothing was holding me up . Just like that . He could have bloody warned me . I 've given a lot of thought to the question of why teleports upset my stomach ; why they seem to have that effect on all Easterners , but not on Dragaerans . In between teleports , I 've often decided it is all in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teleport I 've found that answer unsatisfying . The explanation that sprang to mind as I stood before Morrolan 's castle , surrounded by his walls , towers , and guards , is that teleports also upset the Dragaeran stomach , but Dragaerans just wo n't admit it ; how can having your innards flop around so violently that you can feel them sloshing not make you queasy ? Could natural selection account for it ? I do n't buy it ; I just do n't think that nature had it in mind for people to get from one place to another without passing through the intervening area . These thoughts , I should explain , were one way I occupied my mind while I gave my stomach time to settle down . Another way was to observe that the sentries in the towers were watching me , although they did n't seem especially surprised . Okay , so I was expected . Over one tower floated a single banner , all of grey . Eventually I risked a look down . There were trees below me that looked like miniature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines of brown and blue respectively , meeting and crossing and running almost parallel to form a design that , if I tried , I could convince myself was a mark in some runic alphabet . Maybe it was a symbol that told the castle , " Do n't fall down . " That was a comforting thought . I adjusted my cloak , ran a hand through my hair , and approached the double doors of Castle Black . They swung open as I approached , which I should have been expecting , because they 'd done the same thing last time . I cursed under my breath but kept a small smile on my lips and did n't break stridethere were Dragonlords watching . I had n't noticed it the last time , but one reason that it is so effective to see Lady Teldra appear when the doors open is that she is all you can seethe entryway is unlit , and except for her you might be entering the void that one imagines as the land of the dead . ( The land of the dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mind . ) " My Lord Taltos , " said Teldra . " Thank you for gracing our home . The Lord awaits you . Please , enter and be welcome . " I felt welcome in spite of my more cynical side whispering , " Whatever . " I crossed the threshold . Lady Teldra did not offer to take my cloak this time . She guided me into the hall with all the paintings , through it , up the wide , curving stairway , and eventually to the library . It was big and full of stuffed chairs and thick books ; three of the books , sitting just beyond the entrance , were massive jewel-encrusted objects each chained to a pedestal ; I wondered but resolved not to ask . As I entered , Morrolan set a book down and stood up , giving me a small bow . He opened his mouth , probably to make some sort of ironic courtesy , as a counterpoint to Teldra 's sincere one , but I said , " Who died ? " before he could get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loiosh , and nodded toward a chair next to his . I sat down . He said , " Baritt . " I said , " Oh . " Morrolan seemed to want me to say something , so eventually I said , " You know , the first time I met him I had the feeling he would n't be " " Do not joke about it , Vlad . " " All right . What do you want me to say ? I did n't get the impression he was a friend of yours . " " He was n't . " " Well ? " Lady Teldra appeared with refreshmenta white wine that would have been too sweet except that it was served over chunks of ice . I sipped it to be polite the first time , and then discovered I liked it . The Issola glided from the room . There was no table on which to set the goblet down , but the chair had wide , flat arms . Very convenient . " Well ? " I repeated . " In the second place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . And in the first place " " He was a Dragon , " I concluded . " Yeah , I know . " Morrolan nodded . I drank some more wine . The sensation of cold helps reduce the sensation of sweetness . I bet you did n't know that . " So , what happened to the poor bastard ? " Morrolan started to answer , then paused , then said , " It is unimportant . " " All right , " I agreed . " It is unimportant to me , in any case . " I had met Baritt , or , more properly , his shade , in the Paths of the Dead . He had taken an instant dislike to Morrolan because Morrolan had the bad taste to be traveling with me , which should give you an idea of how Baritt and I had hit it off . I continued , " I assume it is n't a request for sympathy that led to your invitation . " " You are correct . " " Well ? " He turned his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is it you gave me , Vlad ? " I laughed . " Is that it ? Is that what this is all about ? " " Actually , no . I 'm just curious . " " Oh . Well , remain curious . " I had , in fact , injected him with the blood of a goddess for reasons too complicated to explain now , and , at the time , I was in no condition to explain anything . " As you wish . Baritt , as I say , died . In going through his possessions " " What ? Already ? He ca n't have been brought to Death . gate yet . " " And ? " " Well , that seems awful quick for you long-lived types . " " There are reasons . " " You 're just full of information , are n't you ? " " Were I to tell you matters pertaining to the internal politics of the House of the Dragon I should only weary you . And I should then have to kill you for knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such information . " " A good thought , " I said . Loiosh shifted on my shoulder , evidently getting restless . " As I was saying , in going through his possessions , certain items were discovered . " He stopped . I waited . He resumed . " He had a large collection of Morganti weapons . A large collection . Hundreds of them . " I repressed a shiver . " I suppose the reason he had them is none of my business , too . " " That is correct . And , in any case , I do n't know . " " Well then , what about them ? " " I spent a good portion of yesterday inspecting them . I have an interest in such things . " " Figures . " His eyes narrowed for a moment , then he evidently decided to ignore it . " Such weapons , " he went on , " represent powder . Some covet power , some are threatened by others coveting power . " " Which are you ? " " The former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I did n't expect you to admit it . " " Why not ? " I could n't answer that so I did n't . " Go on , " I said . " Who 's the enemy ? " " You are perspicacious . " " Yeah , but my physicker says it can be treated . " " He means you 're perceptive , Boss . " I know that , Loiosh . " " Yes , " said Morrolan . " I believe that I am likely to come into conflict with someone over possession of these weapons . " " Who might that be ? " " I do n't know . There are several possibilities . The likeliest iswell , it does n't matter . " " That 's helpful . " " For what I want from you , you do n't need to know . " " That 's fortunate . Well , what do you want then ? " " I want you to arrange for the stolen weapons to be traced . " " Some weapons have been stolen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see . How certain are you ? " " Reasonably . " " Why ? " " That , too , is unimportant . I will be protecting them , as will various others . Whoever wishes to steal one or more will have to hire an expert thief , and that means the Jhereg , and that means " " I might be able to find out what 's become of it . I see . " " Boss , this could get you into trouble . " " I know . " I sat back and looked at Morrolan . He held my gaze . After a moment I said , " That is n't at all the sort of thing I 'm any good at , Morrolan . And , to tell you the truth , if I did find out , I do n't believe I could bring myself to tell you . It 's a Jhereg thing , you know ? " " I believe I do , yes . " He frowned and seemed to be considering . " On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , how the Jheregwork , whoever did the stealing would be unlikely to be more than a tool , hired by Someone else , is that correct ? " " Yes , " I said , not terribly happy about where this was going . " Well then , could you find out " " Maybe , " I admitted . " What would it take ? " " Money . A lot of it . " " I have money . " " I still want to think about it . It could put me into a situation I 'm not certain I 'd like . " " I understand . Do think about it , though . I can offer you " " Do n't tell me . I 'd rather not be tempted . I 'll let you know . " He nodded and did n't press the issue , which earned him some points with me . " There 's another matter , " he said . I bit back irony and waited . " The circumstances of Baritt 's death " " Which are none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , made me aware of the vulnerability of Castle Black . " " I beg your pardon ? " " The circumstances of " " I heard you , I just do n't Understand . How is a castle floating half a mile or more in the air vulnerable ? Other than to falling down , of course . " " That is n't likely . " " I 'm glad to hear it . Which reminds me , why do n't my ears pop when I teleport up ? " He looked smug but did n't tell me . " Obviously , " he said , " the castle can be penetrated by anyone who can teleport and conceal himself from my guards . " " You do n't have any security precautions ? " " Some , but not enough . It seems to me you could be of some assistance in telling me where to improve them . " I thought it over , and realized that I knew exactly how to go about it . " Yes , I can do that . " I considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be more profitable to do a good job and allow him to display his generosity . He frowned for a moment , and seemed lost in thought . " Psychic communication , Boss . " " I knew that , Loiosh . " " You 're a liar , Boss . " " Well , yeah . " At about that time , a Dragonlord entered the room and bowed to Morrolan . He was short and rather stocky for a Dragaeran , with short , light-brown hair and pale eyes ; he did n't strike me as a fighter , but he wore a blade , which meant he was on duty in some capacity . Morrolan said , " Fentor , this is Baronet Vladimir Taltos . I know you are willing to work with Easterners , but are you willing to take orders from a Jhereg ? " Fentor said , " My lord ? " Loiosh said , " What did he say ? " I said , " Errgh ? " Morrolan said , " I 've just hired Lord Taltos as a security consultant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances . " I felt my mouth open and close . Morrolan had what ? And when had he done this ? Fentor said , " That will not be a problem , my lord . " " Good , " said Morrolan . " Excuse me , " I said . " Yes ? " " I ... " " Yes ? " " Never mind . A pleasure , Fentor . " " The same , my lord . " " Boss , you 've just been hired . " " Well , yeah . Recruited , actually . " " You should tell him to never use this power in the service of evil . " " I 'll be sure to . " It occurred to me , also , that it was going to be harder , now that I was more or less working for him , to avoid trying to get the information he was after . Of course , maybe I 'd get lucky , and no one would steal any of the weapons . Something made me doubt this . Fentor bowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Morrolan , what are n't you telling me ? " " Many things . " " In particular . I get the feeling that you are n't just generally worried about someone stealing some random Morganti weapon . " " You should trust your feelings ; they seem to be reliable . " " Thank you so much . " He stood abruptly and said , " Come with me , Vlad . I 'll show you around and introduce you to a few people . " " I can hardly wait , " I said . I got up and followed him .
