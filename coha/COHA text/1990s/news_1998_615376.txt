<p> In this rural east Georgia community , they were nearly invisible  --  Elbert County 's poorest and most isolated citizens , either mentally or physically disabled , few with family ties and most unaware even of how to lodge complaints . <p> For years , state officials allege , many of these vulnerable citizens were systematically preyed upon by the very people who were in charge of protecting them . <p> " In all my years with ( the State Department of Human Resources ) , and all the cases I 've looked at , it 's the most gross case of system failure I 've ever seen , " said Carl E. Roland , director of DHR 's Division of Mental Health , Mental Retardation and Substance Abuse . " The checks and balances just were n't there , but even if they had been , it 's very hard when people decide together that they 're going to engage in criminal activity and exploit people . " <p> In as many as 20 cases here , state officials say , those caring for the mentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life insurance policies  --  giving the caretakers a financial stake in client deaths . Investigators believe caretakers sold the policies to clients , then used the clients ' Social Security to pay policy premiums . <p> Copies of insurance documents show that one of those insured clients was Talmadge Goss , a 52-year-old mentally disabled man . He died in February 1996 , a month after he was admitted to Elbert Memorial Hospital with symptoms of starvation and dehydration , according to hospital records . Investigators said that a $ 10,000 policy on Goss subsequently paid benefits to Herbert Gaines , the Elbert County manager with the Northeast Georgia Community Service Board , which was responsible for overseeing Goss ' care . <p> Goss is one of seven mentally disabled adults whose deaths are under investigation , according to state and local authorities . <p> A center worker 's concerns about the insurance arrangements involving clients led state authorities to examine the operations of the Elbert County office . This past February , the state began investigating allegations of insurance fraud . That probe has widened , District Attorney Bob Lavender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misuse of state funds , Medicaid fraud and allegations of criminal neglect and abuse of clients , whose disabilities include mental retardation , autism , physical infirmities and cerebral palsy . <p> The investigation focuses on Athens and Elberton employees of the Northeast Georgia Community Service Board , which provides mental health , mental retardation and substance abuse treatment and services . <p> No arrests have been made , but Lavender said he likely will seek indictments , probably in early 1999 , against some of nine workers in Elberton and Athens who have been fired for alleged wrongdoing since the investigation began . <p> The picture that emerges from interviews with CSB employees , state officials and investigators , along with documents and reports obtained by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution , is of a community care network that seemed to operate with almost no oversight . According to state reports and investigators , it apparently was a system where state and federal benefits were misappropriated , where client neglect was routine , and where eligibility for benefits was envisioned as a product for sale . And it allegedly went on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long to detect because of a lack of oversight systems , the lack of knowledge by the ( Northeast Georgia Center ) management staff and the desire not to want to see problems , " said Region 3 Director Margaret Bradford . <p> Contract forms discovered on the hard drive of a computer used by Betty Harper , a center employee who used to bring clients with her to church , offer a glimpse into how profoundly the center 's social services mission may have been corrupted . One computer form states that Harper " will serve as a representative and assistant " to clients seeking to qualify for federal benefits  --  in exchange for 10 percent of the benefits received . Another form ups the benefits fee for " consultational assistance " to 15 percent . Investigators said they have n't identified anyone who acknowledges signing such a contract , but Harper 's dismissal letter alleges she helped people who were n't mentally disabled to be classified as such in order to receive benefits . ' C ' still stands for colored <p> Elbert County is nestled by the Savannah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Billboards hail Elberton as the granite capital of the world , and it will be a long time before they run out of tombstone material . A continuous deposit of high-grade granite six miles wide and 35 miles long suggests that as long as there are graves to be marked , there will be employment opportunities here . For those willing to embrace the hard work of the quarries and the sheds , a high school diploma has never been crucial ; 45 percent of the county 's population does n't have one . <p> In this county where African-Americans make up 34 percent of the population , Probate Court records of deceased black citizens still are marked with a " C " for colored . But it is not a community marred by racial tension . Black and white residents work together and serve side-by-side in athletic booster clubs , the theater foundation and in other community organizations . <p> Yet , complaints about discrimination and racial politics figure into what allegedly went wrong . <p> Almost all who worked for Community Support Services , the Elbert residential part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work and training branch , were black people . So were most of their disabled clients . <p> But there were few black managers in the Athens office of the center , which provides social services to a 10-county district that includes Elbert . And over the years , several black employees of the center complained about inequities in promotion opportunities , filing discrimination lawsuits and complaints with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . <p> One was Linda Lloyd , who settled a racial discrimination lawsuit last year after being passed over for promotion . She was in charge of mental retardation services for the district before she was dismissed in April . <p> State authorities and several people with first-hand knowledge of how the center works said they believe this racial climate shielded the Elberton office from the oversight it normally would have received from Athens supervisors . Rather than risk possible litigation or further complaints by raising questions , Elbert County was left alone . <p> " The ( Northeast Georgia Center ) was unusual because county managers were much more powerful and autonomous than in any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of monitoring and evaluation for DHR . <p> " Part of the way the agency was set up led to the breakdown in checks and balances . The center director ( Lisa McKinney ) did n't feel empowered to tackle some issues because of political repercussions in Elbert County . The county manager ( Herbert Gaines ) had more political clout there than anywhere else in our system . " McKinney , who is a white woman , resigned . She would not comment for this article . Fired officials known for hard work <p> Many in Elberton have trouble believing the fired workers could have done anything wrong . They find the allegations especially surprising in the case of Gaines , 43 , and Harper , 52 , a social services technician . Both natives of Elbert County , they were fixtures in the center and well-known in the town . <p> Except for a brief stint at Georgia Southwestern College , where he studied recreation , Gaines has lived in Elberton all of his life . Harper 's tenure with the state stretches back to the 1970s . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ranks to earn about $ 30,000 annually in a community where 25 percent of the households earn less than $ 10,000 annually . <p> As county manager for the CSB , Gaines had considerable clout , making decisions about client placement in area dwellings and payments to personal care home owners . He also controlled an estimated 50 part-time jobs involving client care  --  a significant position in a county where black unemployment runs as high as 15 percent . <p> Both Harper and Gaines were known for working long hours and when needed on the weekends . Employment evaluations over the years laud both Harper and Gaines as workers who fulfilled or exceeded expectations in their job duties and who valued the developmentally disabled as individuals . Although he was suspended briefly in 1985 for verbally and physically abusing a mentally disabled woman , employment records generally assert that Gaines had a calm , easy-going manner with even the most difficult clients , and excellent public relations skills . <p> The records praise Harper for excellent communication skills and note her practice of taking clients on outings . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet something went wrong . <p> In the fall of 1997 , a center worker going through files at the Elberton Center offices came across some policies issued by Woodmen of the World Life Insurance Society . The life insurance policies , most between $ 10,000 and $ 25,000 , were on center clients and listed local employees as beneficiaries . <p> Disturbed , the worker quietly copied the documents and gave them to friends , who passed them to Rep. Tom McCall ( D-Elberton ) . In January , the legislator showed the copies to Gov . Zell Miller , who had vowed to put more effort into detecting Medicaid fraud . <p> The insurance commissioner 's office and DHR were alerted . A team of inspectors was dispatched from Gracewood State School and Hospital , a state-operated facility for the mentally disabled in Augusta . <p> Completed in March , the Gracewood report dealt a significant blow to the Northeast Georgia Center , saying that the care provided to many Elbert County clients was substandard . <p> Information from DHR led to dismissals : Five were fired in Elberton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked in supervisory or oversight capacities . <p> Among the Gracewood findings : Mentally disabled clients were living in homes with rotted floors , no running water , broken furniture , dangerous stairways , dirty kitchens and no heat . Bathrooms were filthy ; food was decomposing in kitchens ; and first aid kits and fire extinguishers were missing . The part-time staff caring for clients followed no formal communication system in some cases , so someone working the night shift might not know what had happened during the day . ( Some part-timers could n't write well enough to record information or keep medication logs and could n't read the labels on prescriptions , a former worker said . ) There was little structured activity , with only 10 of 77 clients attending the county 's day service center , Quali-tech . ( In the past , records show , some employees there had clashed with CSS officials over the care of clients , and there was a history of tension between the two organizations . ) Most clients who did n't hold jobs were left alone to watch television @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One client told the Gracewood team that neighborhood people gave her marijuana to smoke ; another client stole a car and wrecked it , damaging several other vehicles . Clients reported having food stamps and money stolen , and being physically intimidated by center employees ' friends and relatives . State officials repeatedly recommended that a profoundly mentally disabled , nonverbal woman be moved from a personal care home where another client had choked to death . Periodically , CSS employees assured the state they were working on the relocation , but not until the Gracewood team intervened , was she moved  --  six years after her relocation was requested . <p> Records show that Talmadge Goss was admitted to Elbert Memorial Hospital in January 1996 with symptoms of starvation and dehydration . According to her dismissal letter , Marian Moss , 44 , a high school graduate who worked as a social worker , told doctors not to take exceptional measures to revive Goss . He died the next month . <p> Gaines , who was supervising Goss ' care , collected $ 10,000 from an insurance policy after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Copies of insurance documents show Gaines was falsely listed as a relative of Goss . <p> Although he did not comment for this article , Gaines said in an earlier interview with the Journal-Constitution that he did n't know how he was named the beneficiary . He said he had asked Woodmen of the World representative Don Norman , a center employee in Athens , to remove his name from the policy and said he thought Norman had complied . Gaines said he reported the benefit payment to Lloyd , his supervisor , and that any insurance benefits were to cover client funeral costs . <p> Norman , one of the nine fired , has refused to comment . Gaines said he paid Goss ' funeral costs , then gave the remaining money to the dead man 's family . Goss ' cousin , Nellie Allen , said she told investigators this year that she did n't receive a penny from Gaines and does n't know of any relative who did . Financial questions are raised <p> The Gracewood report said insufficient funds had been allocated for clients . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed three or four people living in a group arrangement , with another $ 25 budgeted for personal items and supplies . Yet , officials said Social Security typically pays disabled clients $ 494 a month , suggesting a combined sum of nearly $ 2,000 was available for living expenses . As a result , the Gracewood report said , clients often lacked food and other necessities . Some personal support workers used their own money to buy food and cleaning supplies for group residences . <p> While the Gracewood report concentrated on client safety and welfare , financial issues raised in the report attracted the attention of other agencies . <p> " There appeared to be a slush fund created with food stamps and food stamp money , and the investigators are seeing where it 's leading , " said Lavender , the district attorney . " Employees had control over that money . They had petty cash funds and other various accounts set up . " <p> By early spring , the GBI 's Health Care Fraud Unit , the inspector general of the Social Security Administration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the investigation . These agencies , which are expected to complete their work this month , uncovered other financial irregularities . <p> Investigators with the Health Care Fraud Unit say that center employees may have billed Medicaid for thousands in services not rendered . <p> Center staff in Elberton were listed in some cases as payees for Social Security checks and food stamps , according to findings of an administrative investigation obtained by the Journal-Constitution in an Open Records Request . The review said that center employees  --  Gaines , Harper , Moss and social service technician Joyce Harris  --  had control of some clients ' checking accounts . <p> Among the irregularities cited in the administrative findings were checks made payable to staff members ; life insurance premiums paid by check or automatic draft ; no bills found for these premiums ; checks signed with clients ' signatures " obviously not written by them " ; and accounts that were unbalanced , unreconciled and overdrawn . <p> " At first , I could n't believe ( the allegations ) , but I kind of got ripped off , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has spoken to state investigators . He moved into his own handicap-accessible apartment two years ago with help from Gaines and other CSS workers . Confined to a wheelchair , Allen receives round-the-clock help . <p> " I got some money , and Herbert ( Gaines ) said he 'd keep it safe for me , " he said . " We were right tight . I trusted Herbert like a brother , so I gave him about $ 1,200 . They try to say I spent it , but I know I did n't spend but $ 200 . Once you trust people and they do you like this , it makes it hard to trust someone else . " <p> Allen differs from some CSS clients in that he receives frequent visits from his extended family , most of whom live in Elbert County . <p> A number of the clients in the residential program had no family support . Either they were n't from Elbert County or their relatives were dead or in nursing homes , and they had no visitors . Most were living not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are n't inspected by state officials . <p> " A lot of these people did n't have any living relatives to check on them , " Lavender said . " It looked like there was little chance of getting caught , or somebody complaining . " <p> On occasion , Elbert County residents might spot these developmentally disabled citizens in Wal-Mart or at a yard sale , outings termed " activity therapy events to facilitate community integration . " But authorities suggested many of these clients were so isolated that people in the community probably were n't even aware of their existence , much less their problems . <p> Mostly , they were invisible . ' Possibility of some conspiracy charges ' <p> Those dismissed in the wake of investigations include Gaines and the four women he supervised  --  Moss , Harper , Harris , 44 , and secretary Stacey Rucker White , 25 . Lavender said the personal relationships between them  --  if they are shown to exist  --  may be relevant " to show how these things occurred . We are looking at the possibility of some conspiracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens office were Christine Wren , 47 , former head of mental retardation services in charge of quality improvement ; Norman , 61 , a program assistant working with Wren who also sold life insurance ; and Lloyd , 43 , the head of mental retardation services , also for alleged misconduct . <p> After winning her appeal , Wren recently reached a tentative settlement with the Community Service Board , which reinstates her , provided the State Retirement Board lets her buy 25 months of service and retire by June 1999 , according to CSB attorney Michael Daniel . <p> Georgia Anderson , 41 , a notary public who worked as a secretary for Wren and then for Lloyd , also was fired from the Athens office . She was dismissed for misconduct , allegedly notarizing documents pertaining to life insurance that contained false information naming staff members as relatives . <p> Of the nine , only Wren and Norman are white . Civil rights activist Hosea Williams has alleged racism in the firings , and Lloyd has lodged another complaint with the EEOC . She claims the fired employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer their version of events or defend themselves . <p> " Anything about abuse and neglect that I knew about , I corrected , " she said . " If I did anything wrong , I trusted people too much . " <p> Attorney John Clark , who represents all of the fired black employees except Lloyd , said he advised his clients not to discuss the matter . Clark also declined to comment . Changes to help create safeguards <p> The Northeast Georgia Community Service Board is part of the support network created over the last few decades to help citizens move from institutions into communities . In many parts of Georgia , community-based care is credited with greatly improving and enhancing the lives of the developmentally disabled . <p> But in moving to community-based care , DHR officials concede that few checks and balances were mandated statewide to safeguard the well-being of disabled clients . <p> " We do not know there 's not another ( situation ) like this somewhere , " said DHR Division Director Roland . " But what I can tell you is the odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In Elbert and the other counties in the Region 3 area , a private Atlanta agency now evaluates the quality of services for 220 to 225 clients . <p> In the past few months , developmentally disabled clients in Elbert County have become a little more visible . Staff workers said there are more people working in jobs in town and there is more community support in the form of special events and activities at Quali-tech . <p> Thirteen clients kept in substandard housing have been moved to better quarters . Among them are four , mentally handicapped men , who lived for years in an aging , dimly lit mobile home lined with unfinished particle board . Their rent for those quarters was $ 800 a month , center officials said . <p> Every employee in the 10-county district  --  which includes Athens-Clarke , Barrow , Walton , Jackson , Madison , Greene , Oglethorpe , Elbert , Oconee and Hart counties  --  also has been trained in goal-setting , documentation and program standards , while clients have been told how to file grievances and complaints . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know ' as an excuse to explain what they did , so we wanted to make sure everyone understands how we proceed and what our values are , " said Mark Stricklett , acting director of mental retardation services . " ' I do n't know ' is an excuse I do n't want anyone to have . <p> This dim , sagging mobile home lined with particle board was home to this man and other mentally retarded of the Northeast Georgia Center for years .
