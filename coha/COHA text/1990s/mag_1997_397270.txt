It 's Not Free Markets ' <p> In the bad old days before the birth of modern science , people were often mystified and scared by things that in more recent times are rather routinely understood and handled . <p> This applied to all kinds of topics , but was especially true of many types of illness . Such afflictions , it was thought , were caused by evil spirits , " humors " in the body , or other esoteric forces . Magic , incantations , bleeding and the like were standard panaceas , often doing more harm than good to the unhappy patient . <p> That was then and this is now  --  at least in terms of the physician 's art . In matters of this sort , we generally view ourselves as being more enlightened than our forebears , but this is only half-way true . Our society knows a lot about miracle drugs and MRIs , but precious little , it would appear , about the legal/economic setting in which such marvels are delivered . Here we still grope our way along in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this regard are the closely linked developments of runaway health care expenses on the one hand and the sudden mushroom expansion of " managed care " providers on the other . Both are widely viewed as major problems , prompting a series of piecemeal reforms and regulations through the years , and numerous calls of late for still more drastic measures . Yet there is little to indicate that the would-be reformers have the foggiest notion as to what has caused these problems , and thus little prospect that what is done will help us . <p> That we have serious trouble on both fronts is not to be disputed . As a percent of GDP , health-care expenditures have more than doubled since 1965 ( from less than 6% to roughly 14% of national output ) . We spend over a trillion dollars a year on health care , and in per-capita outlay and rate of increase exceed all other nations . The costs for all of this are reflected in burgeoning state and federal health care budgets , and sky-rocketing premiums for job-based insurance for employees . Per-capita annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well over $5,000 , and family premiums for covered workers are also at this level . <p> Closely tracking these prodigious numbers has been the phenomenal growth of " managed care " and HMOs ( health maintenance organizations ) . As of 1996 , 110 million Americans were enrolled in these unusual programs , a figure that has quadrupled in a decade . Some 75% of all individuals covered by job-based insurance , on recent estimates , are now in " managed care . " More than 13 million Medicaid recipients have been put into such arrangements , and efforts are constantly being made to up the ante . Similar moves have been attempted , and more proposed , for Medicare recipients . <p> While all of this has been going on , ironically , " managed care " and HMOs have been the subject of countless negative stories in the press , and numerous charges that they endanger the health  --  and lives  --  of their enrollees . No day passes , it would seem , without some new allegation of care denial , people forced out of hospitals prematurely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a good deal else . All these matters have been the subject of congressional hearings , state and federal regulation , and action by attorneys general . <p> It would thus appear that " managed care , " brought forward as a remedy for rising costs , is a serious problem in its own right . Arguably , it is much the greater problem if it in fact endangers lives  --  since rising costs , bad as they are , endanger only budgets . Again , however , there seems to be no comprehension of why this strange scenario should be occurring : Why so many people are in " managed care , " why the horror stories keep appearing , or where this knot of troubles comes from . <p> As it happens , the underlying causes for this skein of woe are fairly plain  --  visible to anyone who knows some basic economics , leavened with a bit of history . At the base of the health-care cost explosion  --  and the aftershock of " managed care "  --  is a bland refusal by our policy-makers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual case , indeed , the problem goes beyond this , to saying that price should be irrelevant to health care . Everyone , we hear it said , should have access to medical services as needed , regardless of ability to pay . A noble sentiment , no doubt , but as a policy fraught with peril . <p> In obedience to this concept , we have created a system in which the prevailing method of finance is " third-party payment "  --  meaning that someone other than the patient picks up the tab for service . Thanks to official policies of several kinds , some 90% of hospital costs  --  and more than three-quarters of all doctor bills  --  are now handled on this basis . The merits of this approach may be defended on welfare or other grounds , and often have been  --  a debatable topic which space forbids discussing ; suffice it here to note that , with this system locked in place , there should be no doubt at all as to why we are facing runaway expenses . <p> Perverse Incentives . As Econ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't teach this any more ) , when the price of a valued good or service is seen as being extremely low , demand will rise accordingly ; in this case , the service is thought to be of utmost value and the price perceived as close to zero . This set-up by itself would greatly boost expenses . However , to make matters even worse , for many years health-care providers were reimbursed on a cost-plus basis ( though over the past decade or so policies have been adopted to reverse this ) . The effect of these incentives was that neither producers nor consumers had much reason to worry about the costs , but simply sent along the bills to the government and/or insurers for payment . <p> To spot the fallacy in this scheme does n't require a course in economics ; a little common sense will do just fine . Suppose you were to give 10 of your friends a duplicate of your credit card and send them to the malls to do some shopping . Since they would do the buying and you the paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they bought , and you would be headed for the poorhouse . Such an arrangement is so obviously dumb that nobody would dream of doing anything remotely like it . Yet this is precisely the way we pay for health care  --  the major difference being that it involves not 10 people , but scores of millions . <p> By far the largest single chunk of third-party payment in the system goes for Medicare and Medicaid  --  both enacted , not so coincidentally , in 1965 . However , these two gigantic and rapidly growing programs are not alone : Add to these the estimated 160 million Americans who have job-based health coverage , which thanks to a quirk in the revenue code is mostly paid for by employers and is a much valued tax-free benefit to workers . Among them , these measures would be enough to shield health-care consumers from the price of what they are consuming , and have done so . <p> There is , however , one other such item to be discussed , as it connects to what will follow . This is the peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all other forms of insurance that we know of . In keeping with the third-party payment syndrome , health insurance typically covers all kinds of routine , predictable events most of us could pay for out of pocket : Doctor visits , tests and check-ups , vision care , teeth-cleaning , etc . This too has been encouraged by official policy , including " mandates " by the states , requiring coverage of everything from wigs to acupuncture . <p> None of this is in fact " insurance , " in the usual meaning of the word . In other realms , " insurance " means protection against some potential risk or unforeseen calamity that is neither predictable nor inexpensive . While we now take for granted that " health insurance " should cover routine expenses of all sorts , we would be unlikely to do the same with other types of coverage . Automobile or home insurance written on this basis , for example , would pay for gas fill-ups , oil changes , lube jobs , new tires , home heating oil , lawn maintenance , electric bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost a fortune , and few would choose to pay household expenses in this manner . Again , however , this is exactly what we do with health care . <p> Having created this incredibly costly system , we are now much puzzled as to why health care outlays are rising and have set about to stop them  --  thus launching ourselves from the pre-scientific twilight into total economic darkness . Over the years , the federal government has attempted a vast array of controls and regulations aimed at stemming the upward push of outlays for Medicare and Medicaid . An alphabet soup of agencies , regs , and cookbook formulae for payment has been created : PSROs , DRGs , RB/RVS , etc . These have done little to slow the growth of spending , though they have had effects of other kinds , mostly bad ones . What it all boils down to in the end is price controls and rationing  --  cutting back on reimbursements , hustling people out of hospitals as soon as possible , and otherwise trying to fence the problem in around the edges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelling upward , such measures must inevitably be futile . In essence , as third-party payment pushes expenses up , the regulators frantically try to push them down . It 's like trying to clamp a lid on a boiling kettle , or driving a car with one foot on the gas and the other on the brake . Such Canute-like methods do little to slow the rise of spending , but can do a lot to injure the machinery  --  and those affected by its workings . <p> Intensifying the Problem . It is against this backdrop of rising costs and failed controls that " managed care " has now come surging to the forefront . In one view , this is but the latest version of price controls and rationing , and it is all of that  --  perhaps the most iron-clad and comprehensive system of controls this country has yet seen in peacetime . It is , however , some other things as well . The rise of the HMO regime signals the morphing of our health-care system into something radically new and different  --  something that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients should be extremely scary . <p> The first thing to be observed in this respect is that HMOs not only fail to address the underlying causes of the problem , but actually serve to make them worse . That is , they promise even more third-party payment , covering still more everyday expenses , thus further boosting the upward pressure of demand . Here , for instance , is the language of one brochure from a major HMO , aimed at Medicare recipients : " No Medicare deductibles . Affordable co-payments . Unlimited hospital stays when medically necessary . Emergency care anywhere in the world . Virtually no claim forms to file .... Routine physical exams ( preventive health services ) . Prescription drug discounts . Dental coverage . Vision coverage . " <p> To Medicare recipients  --  and anyone else recruited by an HMO  --  this perhaps sounds like a shrewd bargain . More of everything , it would appear , but at a lower out-of-pocket cost . In fiscal terms it must seem even better to governments and employers who pick up most of the tab , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlays . ( Hence their rush to sign up enrollees and employees . ) But how , it may be asked , is this financial circle being squared ? How is it possible to promise more of everything , and yet deliver the product at lower cost ? To solve that riddle we must examine the inner workings of HMOs , and see why they function as they do . <p> Denial of Care . Note in the language quoted that most of the free or nearly free things recipients are promised are routine and fairly inexpensive . This both sounds good as a recruiting pitch and may even be a source of satisfaction , for a while , once people are in the system . Patients receiving all these free or extremely low-cost things on a regular basis will probably think the set-up is a good one . And since this is all the vast majority of people need at any given time , they will show up in the surveys as customers happy with their HMO ( surveys much touted by the " managed care " promoters ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is what happens if you get really sick , and/or require expensive treatment . Here the answers provided by HMOs are , all of a sudden , extremely fuzzy . Again refer to the language quoted  --  the part about " unlimited hospital stays . " This sounds quite generous also , but then adds the seemingly innocuous phrase , " when medically necessary . " But what , exactly , is " medically necessary " ? And , equally important , who decides this ? <p> In this regard , two inter-related points are of key importance : ( a ) The final call as to what is " medically necessary " typically rests with the HMO and its cost-controllers , not with you , or even your physician ; ( b ) the basic mechanisms of " managed care " are geared to denying care that is seen as being too expensive , however essential you might consider it to be when you are hurt or ailing . And even when your doctor thinks some treatment may be needed to assist you , pressures can be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former " managed care " practitioner explained to Congress : <p> " .... The smart bomb of cost containment .... is medical necessities denials ... Even if a plan has a clear benefit package and has all the other perks , like free eye exams or free screening tests for cancer ... the member 's physician will never be the final authority ... This might go unnoticed for simple needs , like a regular office visit or a bout of the flu , but ... when something unexpected or expensive happens ... land mines will start exploding everywhere .... And somewhere in every coverage booklet for every managed care plan is a claim that establishes the plan as the final authority for making determination of medical necessity ... " <p> In short , while promising a vast array of benefits for everyday procedures , the HMO regime sets out to limit the big-ticket items  --  which in other walks of life , it may be recalled , are precisely what we want insurance policies to cover . Health coverage " managed " in this way thus completes the reversal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of pocket , but tends to fade away at crunch time , when you may most desperately require it . An appropriate motto for this system would appear to be : " We 're there until you need us . " <p> The main technique by which the HMOs cut back on costly treatment is something called " resource constraint , " or sometimes " global budgets . " What this means is that a certain fixed amount of money is assigned to health care and people who provide the service must come in within this limit . Methods of this sort are commonly used in other countries , such as Canada and England . It 's often observed that these systems spend less of GDP on health care than we do , despite the fact that they have even more third-party payment . Less frequently noted is the manner in which they do this , and the results that follow . As the upward pressure of demand collides with " global budgets , " care denial ( particularly to older patients ) , technology cutbacks , and waiting lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Elderly , " CR , July 1992 ) . <p> HMOs are , in essence , the American version of this concept . They undertake to provide for people 's medical needs for a fixed amount of money , then " manage " the care that we receive to stay within the limits . This has effects that policy-makers  --  to put it as charitably as possible  --  do n't seem to have thought through very clearly . The most obvious is to reverse completely the incentives of the cost-plus system , in which the provider gets paid more for doing more  --  or more elaborate  --  procedures . When HMOs get a fixed amount per patient , regardless of the care provided , the incentive is to deliver as little care as possible . In simplest terms , the HMO can make more money by doing less . <p> The outcomes of this set-up can be perverse indeed , in terms of finance and medical practice alike . Under Medicare contracts , for example , HMOs agree to take patients off the government 's hands for a fixed percentage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjusted . This is a tidy sum  --  amounting to about $5,000 per enrollee  --  and has adverse effects for taxpayers as well as patients . One such is a systematic effort to " cherry pick " the Medicare population , signing up the healthier folk who on average cost perhaps $500 a year in outlays , not $5,000 . ( Some of the methods used in doing this are detailed in " The Trouble With HMOs , " CR , July 1995 ) . The difference is a huge windfall for the HMO  --  and a net loss of money to Uncle Sam . <p> This is , however , only the beginning . Obviously , such selective recruiting ca n't totally screen out people who are ailing , or will become so , especially among the older population . And even with a younger , fairly healthy risk pool , there will be people who develop serious conditions , and need expensive treatment . Sooner or later an HMO will wind up with people on its hands who are suffering from cancer , heart disease , kidney problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a whole series of very tough controls kicks in to keep the costs to a minimum . <p> Foremost among these is to pass the " global budget " concept down the line , through what is called the " capitation " method . Like the HMO itself , each staff physician is paid a certain sum of money per patient , whether or not that patient comes in for treatment . Accordingly , any savings that are achieved the physician gets to keep , while cost overruns must come out of pocket . Thus , to put it in plain English , the patient is costing the physician money the minute she walks in the door . An ingenious way of making providers intensely cost-conscious , no doubt , but with one minor health-care drawback : It pits the financial interest of the doctor against the medical interest of the patient . <p> Make More By Providing Less . As if all this were not enough , still other devices are used by HMOs to curtail expenses . Some systems employ withholds and bonuses and grading sheets to reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specialists ( a big taboo of managed care ) without going through your " gatekeeper " physician is standard . Moreover , even if your doctor wants to perform or urge some costly measure , there are review boards and controllers who can block this . Consider the following recommendations from a consulting firm that provides physician guidelines to HMOs and other insurers ( reported by The New York Times ) : <p> " For proposed operations ranging from hip replacements to tonsillectomies to heart surgery the consultant recommends refusals and delays unless a patient 's state is serious and painful and other treatments have failed . To save on specialists , generalists are told to handle most epileptic seizures , pneumonia , chronic bronchitis , sprains , tonsillitis , heart failure , herpes , diabetes , thyroid disorders , arthritis , and hemorrhoids . " ( Emphasis added . ) <p> All of this is kept pretty much out of view in HMO recruiting and other literature , in favor of lots of talk about aerobics , free orange juice , preventive care , and smiling . In particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obscurity , though recent criticisms of the system have tended to correct this . <p> Obviously , it would not be very appealing to patients to be told up front , or ever , Your doctor will make more money by providing you less care . It would also doubtless be a turn-off to be told , Your doctor is instructed to seek " refusals and delays " in providing you with major treatment . Hence , though disclosures of all types are required in health care and insurance legislation , bitter opposition to full disclosure of these matters . Hence also the " gag rules " which prevent doctors from telling patients about potential treatments unless these have been checked out with the HMO . <p> There is much more that might be said about this subject , but the foregoing should be enough to explain where all the horror stories come from . In its basic structure , albeit with several variations , the HMO is a machine for denying health care seen as being too expensive , up to and including cases in which your doctor thinks such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while all this is going on , you the patient are all but helpless . Your doctor , if you are lucky , may fight it out with the HMO in attempting to obtain some treatment for you , but you have virtually nothing to say about it . After all , he works for them , and not for you  --  because you are not paying . <p> It is this factor , also , that explains why so many people have wound up , willy-nilly , in " managed care . " Employers alarmed by rising premiums are looking at the bottom line , and thus quite susceptible to the cost-controlling pledges made by HMOs . Likewise , federal lawmakers and state officials , aghast at the continuing growth of health care budgets , are ready to heed the promise of tighter limits on expenses . Since these third parties are paying the bulk of the bills , they have both the incentive and the means to herd people into " managed care , " with little regard for what this means in terms of treatment . Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of authority in the system . <p> Yet More Managed Care . Politically speaking , there is one other aspect of " managed care " that needs discussing , as it affects our prospects for doing anything about it . This is the curious manner in which the subject has been debated lately in the Congress . Over the past few years , the two political parties have basically merged positions on the issue , while not explicitly admitting they have done so . The net effect of this has been to take the question off the table  --  to make " managed care " a matter of bi-partisan consensus , though with collateral squabbles as to how much it should or should n't be subjected to regulation , and other marginalia . <p> HMOs and " managed care , " it will be remembered , were prominent features of the Clinton health plan of 1993-94 , considered essential to a " universal " system . Since such an approach would have created third-party payment to the nth degree , " managed care " was viewed as a needed measure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things conservative and Republican opponents of the plan denounced in urging its rejection . However , once the Republicans won the elections of 1994 and began devising health programs of their own , they immediately opted for " managed care " as well . HMOs and other types of " managed care " were central to the Republicans ' Medicare-Medicaid reforms of ' 95 ( and to those of ' 97 also ) . The GOP thus endorsed the very approach that it had so vehemently criticized under Clinton . <p> The causes of this strange reversal , already touched on , are fairly plain , but still the source of much confusion . Pledged to getting the federal budget under control , Republicans could n't hope to do so without restraining Medicare and Medicaid , but for the most part had not the vaguest notion of how to do this . Enter the advocates of " managed care , " saying they could do it  --  just sign here . Accordingly , a grateful GOP proceeded to let the friends of " managed care " draft much of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clinton health plan become , with no debate whatever , a centerpiece of the " Republican Revolution . " <p> As significant as the practical effects of this reversal are the reasons put forward to explain it . According to a new breed of Republican and conservative " managed care " promoters , HMOs are simply cases of good old free enterprise in action  --  hence proper objects of Republican backing . HMOs , after all , are " businesses " that " make a profit , " and what 's wrong with that ? It 's now argued in these circles that HMOs should be allowed to do their thing , with minimal interference and regulation . <p> This is , however , a delusion , and one that  --  given the current vogue of markets and the GOP control of Congress  --  provides the HMOs with most convenient cover . In point of fact , while HMOs are indeed " businesses " that " make a profit , " they are not free-market institutions , in any serious meaning of the term . In all of their main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little reflection on their modus operandi will suggest . ( For instance , in what other business that you can think of do people make more money by providing you less of what you want ? ) <p> Rationing Devices , Not Free Markets . The key to understanding HMOs and " managed care "  --  and the reason they work the way they do  --  is that they have arisen , precisely , in the absence of a market . A market exists when people pay for what they get , and make choices in response to prices . But these are , as we have seen , exactly the features that have been banished from our health-care system through third-party payment programs . It is because these crucial ingredients are missing that we have all the runaway expenses , and that HMOs are now called on to stem them . HMOs are thus a substitute for , not an extension of , free markets . <p> Beyond this , it may be said that HMOs and " managed care " as currently practiced are not merely private entities but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , if we view the situation as a whole , we observe a badly bloated system shaped in countless ways by acts of official policy : Subsidy programs , the tilting of the tax code , state mandates , community rating , coverage of pre-existing conditions  --  all counter to the normal working of free markets . The present set-up in which demand is to be controlled by fiat instead of price is the result of these repeated interventions . Rationing generally occurs when governments negate the role prices , and in this case the HMOs are the chosen rationing devices . <p> Second , if we focus specifically on Medicare and Medicaid , it should be apparent that what is occurring with these two programs has no resemblance to , or remote connection with , free markets . These are government subsidy programs , pure and simple , and the HMOs now busily signing up their patients are acting as vendors to , and agents of , the state . This has nothing to do with market pricing or free enterprise in general  --  yet it is precisely here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driven by the budgetary pressures , have been striving to put more people into HMOs . In these two cases , beyond all others , HMOs are simply government-authorized machines for rationing care in a non-market setting . <p> Finally , that HMOs are " businesses " which " make a profit "  --  the point on which GOP supporters and some critics of " managed care " seem most to dwell  --  is nothing to the purpose . There are plenty of businessmen , after all , who have raked in money from government programs of all types , from farm subsidies and housing projects to the manipulation of S &Ls.; Such conduct has been all too common in our system , and even more so in other times and places where government favor has been the key to wealth and privilege . In economic jargon , such behavior is called " rent-seeking "  --  which is not only different from free-market conduct , but its direct antithesis . <p> " Rent-seeking " means the exploitation of conditions created by the state to extract returns that would n't exist in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riches in the failed collectivisms of Eastern Europe and kleptocracies of all types around the globe . Such also was " tax farming " in the old regime of Europe , in which appointed agents of the king made their profit by mulcting the public to the limit . Plenty of money was made from such arrangements , but in no sense were they the result of markets . <p> The point of these reflections is more than a theoretical discussion about economics . In the current political climate , the plea that HMOs are merely free enterprise in action is being adroitly used to promote them in a Republican Congress , permit their " rent-seeking " to flourish unabated , and shield them from corrective measures by state and federal governments . Pending reform of the third-party payment system , the alibi of free markets can not be legitimately invoked to fend off consumer safeguards against HMO abuses . <p> It should be stressed , however , that these considerations by themselves can not address the fundamental problems of the HMO regime . The evil is in the very nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the basic premises of a system are mistaken , piecemeal reforms and ad hoc measures can at best redress a problem here and there , and at worst become new problems in their own right : Third-party payment leading to runaway demand ; attempts to control this through price controls and rationing , and now through HMOs ; then regulations laid on top of this to fend off care denial , and so on . The end result of this approach must be a layer cake of controls and regulations that in their cumulative power of interference may bring the system down entirely . The ultimate answer to this chain of woe must be , not a patchwork of further interventions , but deep-going reform of health-care finance in general . <p> ( * ) The chief exception to this was the campaign of some conservative GOPers to add " medical savings accounts " to the Medicare mix , where MSAs appeared as a kind of appendix to the main proposal . <p> By M.
