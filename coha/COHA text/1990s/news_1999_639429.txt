<p> Healing comes from mercy , not paranoia <p> I think many have over-reacted to Michael Ian Campbell , the boy who made an Internet threat . No one seems to remember that this child 's father died only weeks before he reached out with very poor judgment to express his confusion and pain . I feel that the adults who are furious toward Michael are similar to Eric and Dylan in their desire for vengeance and punishment against those who make them feel threatened . Our culture gave Eric and Dylan little modeling of mercy and understanding and that continues with the community 's furor over Columbine . <p> It also worries me that we are moving toward tolerance for punishing people for their thoughts and emotions , rather than crimes . Perhaps our young people will have to get used to being arrested for their ideas ; perhaps the next century will sprout the noxious weeds of fascism and ' thought police . ' Was Michael 's words an example of terrible judgment ? Perhaps even a cry for psychological help ? Yes . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the nature of kids to say stupid things . Thank God , only a very , very , very , very small percentage actually act them out . If we overreact to every such statement , we will never let people heal from Columbine . We will also mislead millions of kids into thinking that when people think , feel and say unfair or threatening things about them they should make it into a federal case . When kids say inappropriate things , adults should have the presence of mind to challenge them without involving the Justice Department . <p> Adult hysteria about Columbine is frightening ; it shows teens that we really do n't have the answers or even self-control in dealing with those issues without becoming irrational ourselves . <p> I have only one millennial wish for the parents of Dylan and Eric and for Michael Ian Campbell , the favorite scapegoats of the moment : mercy . Let 's show our kids that the only hope for true healing comes not from judgment and paranoia , but from compassion . If mercy is not in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the two boys you delight in hating . <p> REBEKAH SHARDY <p> Colorado Springs <p> Once upon a time , we read Shakespeare <p> The current flap over Harry Potter prompted me to pull out my third-grade reader , which I bought when the one-room school house I attended in rural eastern Colorado was demolished to make way for ' progress ' ! <p> The book contains , among other things , a passage from Shakespeare ! When I attended a literature class at a local community college , the other students , most of them 18-year-old graduates from local high schools , questioned the validity of a character with an eighth-grade education in a 19th-century novel quoting Shakespeare . <p> I spoke up and mentioned that we had read Shakespeare by third grade while I went to school . No one believed me , so I brought the reader to class and passed it around . Everyone was amazed that it did , indeed , include passages from Shakespeare . Then the recent high-school graduates tried to read from my grade-school reader and not a single one could read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only could I read Shakespeare by third grade , I also do more reading for personal enjoyment than anyone else who took the class with me . <p> I did all of this without Harry Potter , and I 'm sure today 's young people could do as well if they wanted to do it . <p> Something else my reader contained that is no longer available to third-graders was a story titled ' Joseph and His Brethren , ' taken from the biblical book of Genesis . The theory of that day was that anyone who could read the Elizabethan English in the King James version of the Bible could read anything ! I think the more important question here is how did one-room school houses manage to turn out third-graders who could read Shakespeare while today 's more ' progressive ' educational factories turn out high-school graduates who can not read from my third-grade reader ? <p> GISELLE THORSEN <p> Broomfield <p> Brazil 's capoeiristas improve both body and spirit <p> The Dec. 5 article ' Lure of capoeira is primal ' made me notice how Brazilians are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Brazilian , I love to see a newspaper talking about my country and my culture . Capoeira is really a good thing that everyone should do . It 's not jonly good for our body , but also <p> good for our spirit . <p> This martial art is getting very popular year after year in Brazil . Most of the teenagers want to do and learn more about capoeira . <p> I really think capoeira is a great way to enjoy life . One of the benefits that the article did n't talk about is that capoeira is a great exercise to lose weight . Imagine , having fun and losing weight at the same time . That 's the solution . <p> I congratulate The Post for showing Americans one of the wonderful things that Brazil has . Many Americans should stop to look to themselves , and try to look at other cultures that exist . There is a whole different world outside that should be discovered ! <p> MARINA BORTOLUZZI <p> Fort Collins <p> Proposed Chinese investment ban is legitimate state business <p> The Post editiorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asserts that my call for a policy to ensure that Colorado 's public pension funds do not inadvertently finance the Chinese military is motivated by partisan ideology . On the contrary , it is solely motivated by a concern for security of the United States . The Cox Commission and numerous studies have outlined how the People 's Liberation Army has taken advantage of the ready availability of American investment funds to finance its modernization . In addition , the PLA routinely threatens to retake Taiwan by force while the U.S. is committed to its defense . Finally , CALPERS , the nation 's largest public employee 's pension plan , has already made direct investments in businesses controlled by the PLA . These facts are not in dispute and I presume The Post is as concerned with this nation 's security as I. <p> The Post states the issue is one best handled by the federal government , and I wholeheartedly agree . Clear guidance on this matter from Congress and the President is what we really need . Unfortunately , to date , Congress has failed to act . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) to create an Office of National Security within the Securities and Exchange Commission , has sat dormant in the House since June . <p> Congress ' inaction , however , should not preclude policy makers at other levels from setting the example and acting to protect our national security . The trustees of the public pension funds are not the ones who should make these policies choices because their fiduciary obligation is to seek the best possible returns for their beneficiaries . If it is legal , and meets the plan 's financial standards , trustees should invest accordingly . Since the federal government will not act and public pension fund trustees can not act , the General Assembly should act . Finally , we must not lose sight of whose money this is . These are public pension plans funded with citizens ' tax dollars . For the state to develop policy guidelines for these plans is both prudent and appropriate . <p> MIKE COFFMAN <p> State Treasurer <p> Denver <p> Willing victims <p> Your Dec. 12 editorial ' A message to scalpers ' missed the real truth behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If people would n't pay the ridiculous prices demanded for tickets , the problem would go away . Even the face price on these ' ca n't live without ' events is absurd . Remember the Fleetwood Mac tour ? The real name should have been ' Help Get Mick Fleetwood Out Of Bankruptcy . ' Prices for many such ' reunion ' tours are ridiculously high . But , people pay them , for fear of missing the big event . <p> Same thing with sports , people will pay big bucks to watch a bunch of millionaires kick , hit , catch and run with a ball or puck . When Denver was a minor-league city , we were much better off . You could watch the Zephyrs and Grizzlies without taking out a bank loan . You saw good sports entertainment , and you also saw players giving their all . <p> There may be some light at the end of the tunnel , if you recall the Rockies whining about the lost revenue from empty seats .
