Does Kodak finally have its act together after years of drifting ? Skeptics remain , but Kay Whitmore , the tough-talking new chairman , has certainly shaken things up . <p> KAY R. WHITMORE , Eastman Kodak 's new chairman , has spent 33 years at the company preparing for the job , and he is convinced he knows what ails the $18.4 billion ( revenues ) firm . He diagnoses : " It is clear we can not be all things to all people , doing things that catch our fancy . " <p> The litany of Kodak 's disjointed and poorly focused ill-fated management moves over the past 15 years is certainly discouraging : <p> Instant photography : In a muddled assault on Polaroid , Kodak struggled with its own instant camera only to be hit in 1976 with a massive patent infringement suit . A Boston federal judge just last month awarded Polaroid $909.5 million in damages . <p> Batteries : Kodak introduced its Ultralife lithium battery in 1986 , promising that the nine-volt battery would last ten years on the shelf . But quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but killed advertising on its remaining Supralife brand alkaline battery . <p> Disc cameras : Kodak came out with its ballyhooed Disc in 1982 , a miniaturized camera that used electronics to make its operations automatic . But making the negatives so small meant the prints had to be enlarged so much that they came out grainy . The camera was a flop , and Kodak finally stopped production in 1988 . <p> Film : Reacting to Sony 's 1982 introduction of an electronic camera , Kodak figured the days of silver halide film were numbered . It scrambled to come up with an alternative to its historic profitable business . But the one concrete result is that archrival Fuji has captured about 10% of Kodak 's once commanding 90% market share of U.S. film sales . <p> Information systems : The division that makes copiers and printers is bleeding . Last year it lost $360 million on $4.2 billion in sales . <p> Organizational bungles : Whitmore 's predecessor , Colby H. Chandler , put the company through four separate restructurings beginning in 1983 , losing , through early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Over the same period , long-term debt ballooned to 47% of total capital , from less than 5% . <p> What is Whitmore going to do to set things right ? " What we need to do is more clearly focus our direction , " he says . " And that 's what is happening . We 're all working off of a more common hymn book , if you will . " <p> The hymn has a refrain that goes like this : Kodak is an imaging company . It makes products that process and convert images , be they photographs , hospital X rays or photocopying machines . Kodak 's $3.5 billion ( sales ) chemical operation is a natural outgrowth of imaging , since chemicals are used to convert the images . <p> The presumption from all this is that Kodak wo n't make any more diversification moves like the 1988 acquisition of Sterling Drug , for which it laid out more than $5 billion . The maker of products like Lysol and Bayer aspirin is scarcely an imaging company . Will Kodak sell it ? Whitmore says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joint venture with another drug company . Anyhow , he says , the drug business is closely related to chemicals , a core business for Kodak . <p> Can Whitmore bring Kodak the breath of fresh air this ingrown company badly needs ? Can he refocus the company ? That remains to be seen . Like Chandler before him , Whitmore is a veteran Kodak career man , as are most of Kodak 's senior managers . President since 1983 , Whitmore was part of a management team he 's now trying to distance himself from , as part of his new strategy . Last year he came out the winner in a two-man battle with J. Phillip Samper to succeed Chandler , who retired . Samper promptly quit and went to head up Kinder-Care Learning Centers . <p> But while Whitmore is a familiar face , his rise to the top marked a big change . Under Chandler , Kodak was run in a rather collegial way , with a three-person office of chief executive . With Whitmore 's ascent , power was again concentrated in one person 's hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products : " Kay Whitmore has put our feet to the fire . " Adds Leo J. Thomas , general manager of Kodak 's health division : " We 're a company in transition . We 're approaching that more single-mindedly and aggressively than at any time since I 've been with the company . " <p> It used to take Kodak an average of three years from conception to bring products to market . Now it takes 18 months to two years . For example , Kodak 's disposable camera was out the door in less than 14 months ; by contrast , Kodachrome film took 18 years to develop . <p> Kodak vows to listen closely to its customers , and now sends manufacturing employees on road trips to meet with professional users of film such as Hollywood producers to find out their needs . In the past , the marketing department sold what manufacturing gave it . <p> For Kodak , listening to its customers represents a big change in corporate culture . Previously , the company developed technology and dumped it on the world . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can operate that way , " says Thomas , a career Kodak man who started as a color film research chemist . " Now we have to be more nimble . " If Kodak is only just learning that lesson , it 's a severe condemnation of several decades of management . <p> What do Whitmore and his associates have in the product pipeline ? Recently unveiled is a form of photography that involves taking a photo on silver halide film and running it through a scanner that transfers the image onto an optical compact disc . The CD pops into a videodisc player , which flashes the images on your television . The advantage of the system is that you shoot pictures with existing cameras instead of paying for a new electronic version . <p> Kodak is developing a similar system for the office and desktop publishing market . Instead of getting the images on a television screen , with the new Kodak system the images can be called up on a computer , manipulated and sent through a network . <p> The new technology wo n't be on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopes it will bridge the gap between film and electronic photography , and allow the company to protect its film franchise during the transition to all-electronic photography . <p> To underscore the significance of the photo CD , Whitmore traveled to Japan in September for the official announcement  --  the first time a Kodak chief executive has ever made such an announcement from the home country of archival Fuji . The choice of venue was significant . It served notice to Kodak employees and to the world that Kodak is a global player , not a parochial outfit . More than a decade after Xerox , a fellow Rochester native , abandoned the upstate New York city as its headquarters , Kodak has remained where George Eastman founded it over a century ago . Critics attribute some of Kodak 's slippage to the relative isolation of its headquarters from major global currents . <p> One consequence of the old Rochester mind-set was that Kodak products did n't always take into account regional preferences . For a long time Kodak could get away with ignoring consumer whims because it was so rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been successful in spite of our parochial attitudes because we were the only game in town , " says Fowble . " Today that is n't the case . We have to understand that a product designed for the U.S. is n't the best for a market outside the U.S. " Now , for instance , Kodak sells film in Japan with the ruddier flesh tones preferred by the Japanese . <p> Whitmore is the first to admit that Kodak has a long way to go to convince skeptics it can be a consistent performer . Fresh in the memory of many is his and Chandler 's 1988 annual report forecast of " records in sales and earnings in 1989 . " Suddenly , out of the blue , came news of a massive writeoff for reducing the bloated staff . Instead of setting a record , Kodak ended 1989 with earnings of a paltry $1.63 a share , down 62% . <p> But while there are still reasons for skepticism about Whitmore 's chances of restoring Kodak to its onetime glory , there are also favorable signs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kodak stock , 2% of outstanding , and is the largest institutional holder . Gail S. Landis , a Kodak follower at Bernstein , says that years of reorganizing and cost-cutting are finally paying off . After last year 's staff bloodletting , Kodak 's revenues per employee increased from $117,000 in 1988 to about $133,000 last year . Cash flow is strong at over $500 million in the third quarter alone . The company , if it no longer dominates the film business as it once did , remains a powerful presence in the U.S. and globally . With the cost-cutting largely behind it , the company has bolstered profit margins and improved the decision-making process . <p> Some of the numbers are starting to look pretty good . Third-quarter operating earnings  --  before reserving for the Polaroid settlement  --  were up 22% , to $835 million , on sales of $4.8 billion . Earnings for the year are expected to be about $1.3 billion , $4 a share . This is still below 1988 's record $4.30 , but is a respectable showing all the same , representing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Now to persuade customers , the investment community and the world at large that Kodak is no longer a sleeping giant .
