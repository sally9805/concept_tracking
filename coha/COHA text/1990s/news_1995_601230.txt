<p> The San Francisco 49ers won the Super Bowl , exulted briefly , and then watched the rush for the exit . <p> Offensive coordinator Mike Shanahan left to become Denver 's coach . Defensive coordinator Ray Rhodes accepted Philadelphia 's offer and lured running back Ricky Watters . A bunch of role players also took off , several following Shanahan and Rhodes . <p> " When you 're successful and win , it 's something you have to be prepared to deal with , " 49ers coach George Seifert says . <p> The new-look aspects of the NFC : the Carolina Panthers , playing their inaugural season at Clemson ; the Rams moving to St. Louis from Anaheim , Calif. , and installing Rich Brooks , the long-time Oregon coach , in Chuck Knox 's stead ; Rhodes running the Eagles . <p> USA TODAY NFL writer Larry Weisman previews the NFC teams : <p> ARIZONA CARDINALS Where train : Flagstaff , Ariz. 1994 finish : 8-8 , 3rd in East Coach : Buddy Ryan , 2nd season with Cardinals ( 51-43-1 ) Key changes : Dave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ball and the chance to show he has rehabbed his left knee and career . WR Rob Moore , acquired in trade with New York Jets , is Cards ' best receiver in years . Emphasis is on offense improving on 25th overall ranking . Key concerns : Krieg is NFL 's all-time fumbles leader ( 128 ) , and Ryan hates turnovers . Kick , punt returns need boost , maybe from second-year Chuck Levy . Cardinals had only 35 sacks , a mere six by DE Clyde Simmons . Will Ryan let offensive coordinator Dave Atkins run the show ? <p> ATLANTA FALCONS Where train : Suwanee , Ga . 1994 finish : 7-9 , 3rd in West Coach : June Jones , 2nd season ( 7-9 ) Key changes : A remade receiver corps for the Red Gun offense , with Andre Rison gone ( Cleveland ) . Falcons traded for Browns ' Eric Metcalf , will try him at WR . Also picked up J.J. Birden , smallish but quick . OL gets a new look with long-time LT Mike Kenn retired . Weak defense ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talley , rookie S Devin Bush . Key concerns : Atlanta rushed only 330 times in ' 94 . Falcons need the ability to kill the clock . Pass defense is a problem . Falcons permitted 201 first downs by passing , 27th in NFL . Aging secondary and no rushing game a dangerous combination . <p> CAROLINA PANTHERS Where train : Spartanburg , S.C . 1994 finish : First year in league . Coach : Dom Capers , 1st season Key changes : Look for a 3-4 defense , an emphasis on strong special-teams play and running game . The Panthers will play at Clemson University 's Memorial Stadium in Clemson , S.C. , move to Charlotte stadium in ' 96 . Key concerns : Building a cohesive OL , picking a starting QB ( bet on Frank Reich ahead of Jack Trudeau ) , even the mundane stuff like breaking the huddle . These players are strangers who wo n't get a taste of a real game until July 29 against Jacksonville in Hall of Fame Game . <p> CHICAGO BEARS Where train : Platteville , Wis. 1994 finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 3rd season ( 17-17 ) Key changes : Defense will look different up the middle minus LB Dante Jones and SS Shaun Gayle . Second-year John Thierry steps in at DE with vet Trace Armstrong traded to Miami . WRs upgraded with addition of Michael Timpson . Bears also re-signed QB Steve Walsh but figure to give Erik Kramer every chance to win job back . No. 1 pick Rashaan Salaam should start at RB . Key concerns : DL lacks marquee pass rusher and defense overall has been soft vs. run . Plodding offense needs more quickness and speed . Receivers can run , but can Walsh reach them ? If not , are we playing musical QBs again ? P Chris Gardocki departed , replacement is No. 2 pick Todd Sauerbrun . <p> DALLAS COWBOYS Where train : Austin , Texas . 1994 finish : 12-4 , 1st in East Coach : Barry Switzer , 2nd season ( 13-5 ) Key changes : While management stuck to its philosophy of re-signing the stars ( DE Tony Tolbert , WR Michael Irvin , TE Jay Novacek ) , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alvin Harper , DB Kenneth Gant , DE Jim Jeffcoat ) split . Switzer promises to lead more , let personality shine after a self-enforced year in caretaker role . Key concerns : OL graying , lacks quality depth . Little-used second-year DE Shante Carver has to fill Jeffcoat 's pass-rushing role . Secondary thin at S minus James Washington and Gant . <p> DETROIT LIONS Where train : Pontiac , Mich. 1994 finish : 9-7 , 3rd in Central Coach : Wayne Fontes , 8th season ( 52-53 ) Key changes : Addition of John Teerlinck ( ex-Minnesota ) as defensive coordinator signals move to 4-3 and scheme built on all-out pass rush . Lions also spent big bucks for DT Henry Thomas , Teerlinck 's protege , used No. 1 pick on DE Luther Elliss . Long-time Lions QB Greg Landry joins staff to tutor Scott Mitchell . Key concerns : Mitchell seemed to quake in his high tops last year before breaking a bone in his right ( non-throwing ) hand . Of the NFC 's top 25 rated passers , he was the only one with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw darts ? Can the passing game be tailored to his skills ? Lions also need to replace KR-PR ace Mel Gray , now in Houston . S Bennie Blades could miss training camp after surgery Wednesday on right hand , broken in the aftermath of July 5 shooting death of his cousin , Charles Blades . Recovery is expected to take six weeks . <p> GREEN BAY PACKERS Where train : DePere , Wis. 1994 finish : 9-7 , 2nd in Central Coach : Mike Holmgren , 3rd season ( 29-23 ) Key changes : WR Sterling Sharpe , a brilliant player who never missed a regular-season game in seven seasons , is gone after neck surgery . Packers need to replace his 94 catches ( and 18 TDs ) . Sharpe had 42 TD catches over last three seasons . Edgar Bennett moves from FB to RB . Loss of free-agent LB Bryce Paup ( Buffalo ) hurts . Key concerns : Trades for WR Mark Ingram and TE Keith Jackson look like heists for Miami ; neither player reported . Bennett lacks the speed for a marquee back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reggie White ( turning 34 ) and Sean Jones ( turning 33 ) sharing a Dec. 19 birthday . <p> MINNESOTA VIKINGS Where train : Mankato , Minn. 1994 finish : 10-6 , 1st in Central Coach : Dennis Green , 4th season ( 30-21 ) Key changes : New look on defense , which lived and died by big plays . Only holdover in secondary from opening-day starters is second-year CB Dewayne Washington . DT John Randle thrived next to Henry Thomas , now in Detroit . Vikes will give RB Robert Smith a long look , having cut Terry Allen . Key concerns : Smith is raw , unproven , no threat between the tackles . Ground game needs more consistency , as only one team ( New England , with 699 ) tried more passes than Minnesota ( 673 ) . Defense could have five new starters after an upheaval last year . <p> NEW ORLEANS SAINTS Where train : La Crosse , Wis. 1994 finish : 7-9 , 2nd in NFC West Coach : Jim Mora , 10th season ( 84-63 ) Key changes : Long-time advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free agent Rufus Porter , 2nd-year Winfred Tubbs , and maybe No. 1 pick Mark Fields on the weakside . Wayne Martin moves from DE to DT . CB Eric Allen helps needy secondary . Key concerns : Ground game a disaster in recent years . Talent is there , but who emerges as the workhorse ? Mario Bates looks like the best bet . LB Darion Conner , who signed with Carolina , had 10 1/2 of team 's 36 sacks and Martin had 10 playing LDE . Who 's the outside rusher now ? Saints allowed 407 points , 2nd-highest in NFL , must cut that figure by 100 . <p> NEW YORK GIANTS Where train : Madison , N.J. 1994 finish : 9-7 , 2nd in NFC East Coach : Dan Reeves , 3rd season ( 138-92-1 ) Key changes : DL gets new look with Erik Howard and Mike Fox gone ; Ray Agnew and untested Robert Harris step in . Secondary adds Ss Vencie Glenn and Maurice Douglass , a special teams hitter . Herschel Walker figures in third-down sets to replace David Meggett , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't know . Key concerns : Hampton has lost what little breakaway speed he had . WRs not particularly scary . Brad Daluiso enters fifth season , first as front-line kicker . Draft-day friction between Reeves and personnel guys an unpleasant sign . <p> PHILADELPHIA EAGLES Where train : West Chester , Pa. 1994 finish : 7-9 , 4th in NFC East Coach : Ray Rhodes , first season Key changes : Eagles shift to West Coast offense . QB Randall Cunningham enters final year of contract with fair warning he 'll produce or give way to Rodney Peete . Ricky Watters adds pop to a backfield that has produced one 1,000-yard rusher since 1986 . Key concerns : Can Cunningham absorb a new system that involves reads , decision-making , throwing slants in a controlled passing game ? Secondary faces adjustment without CB Eric Allen and S Rich Miano . Development of LT Bernard Williams and LG Antone Davis , both No. 1 picks , a must . DE William Fuller ( 9 1/2 sacks ) looked worn out during seven-game losing streak that ended season . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1994 finish : 4-12 , 4th in NFC West Coach : Rich Brooks , first season Key changes : New coach , new locale , new training camp . Pretty much the same team , minus WR Flipper Anderson . Brooks coached QB Chris Miller at Oregon , so forget debate at that key position . The disruption of players ' lives in move from L.A. can be extreme enough to ruin season . Key concerns : OL died and nearly got RB Jerome Bettis killed . That 's an area getting attention . Rams created 20 takeaways , 2nd-worst in NFL , and recovered only six fumbles . Clearly they need to be more physical , get more people around the ball . K Tony Zendejas missed four of five FG tries from 40-49 yards . <p> SAN FRANCISCO 49ers Where train : Rocklin , Calif. 1994 finish : 13-3 , 1st in NFC West Coach : George Seifert , 7th season ( 84-24 ) Key changes : New coordinators , with Marc Trestman ( who was out of football ) running offense , ex-N.Y . Jets coach Pete Carroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Philadelphia ) and CB Deion Sanders ( playing baseball ) . Special teams need a look minus Dexter Carter . Key concerns : OL aging and lacking in depth . Receiver corps of Jerry Rice , Brent Jones , John Taylor all older than 32 . Lost several role players and backups to free agency , must hope new signees ( DE Oliver Barnett , SS Marquez Pope ) can contribute . <p> TAMPA BAY BUCCANEERS Where train : Tampa . 1994 finish : 6-10 , 5th in NFC Central Coach : Sam Wyche , 4th season ( 80-100 ) Key changes : First free agent Bucs pursued was P Reggie Roby , but they wo n't punt as much as in the past . WR Alvin Harper adds outside threat . Dealt Craig Erickson to Indianapolis , so QB is Trent Dilfer , lowest-rated passer in NFC in ' 94 who threw more than 10 passes . Defense adds DTs Marc Spindler ( free agent ) and Warren Sapp ( No. 1 pick ) after ranking 26th vs. run . Key concerns : New owner Malcolm Glazer shows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dilfer still raw , threw just 82 passes as a rookie . Bucs ' nine INTs last season was NFL 's worst , and loss of S Marty Carter ( free agency ) did n't help . <p> WASHINGTON REDSKINS Where train : Frostburg , Md. 1994 finish : 3-13 , 5th in NFC East Coach : Norv Turner , 2nd season ( 3-13 ) Key changes : QB Heath Shuler starts from day one . Backfield still shaping up , with RBs Brian Mitchell and Terry Allen front-runners . Rookie WR Michael Westbrook must make the impact Desmond Howard ( Jacksonville ) could n't . Free agency built up LB group ( Marvcus Patton , Rod Stephens ) and helped secondary ( SS James Washington ) . Key concerns : OL a patchwork minus former starters Raleigh McKenzie and Mark Schlereth . DL lacks size , muscle , depth . TE should be key position in Turner 's offense , but ' Skins have no standout . If Mitchell starts at RB , Washington might not get full use of his considerable return skills .
