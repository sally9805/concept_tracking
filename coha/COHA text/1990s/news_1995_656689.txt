<p> ON Sunday , Russia will hold the first fully constitutional parliamentary elections since before the Bolshevik revolution in 1917 . The current Duma , or lower house of parliament , has served for two years under elections held by presidential decree . The new Duma will serve four years , elected under a democratically enacted election law . <p> Only one Russian Duma in history - in 1912 under Czar Nicholas II - has peacefully and legally handed power to a successor Duma . <p> Many Russian voters are unhappy about fallen income and worthless pensions , as well as the sense of lawlessness in Russia . They are expected to shift the Duma toward stronger state controls and a stronger social safety net . The main beneficiary : the Communist Party . <p> The issues where the Communists will want to make a difference : Slowing down privatization of state enterprises and beefing up social payments to pensioners . <p> But Kremlin aides to President Boris Yeltsin have become relaxed about the Duma elections . The Communists may have few , if any , leftist allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of parliament even if they make their projected gains . <p> The real import of this election , however , is as a sort of primary for the Rus-sian presidential election next June . Under the Russian Constitution , the president holds the real power . It takes the vote of two-thirds of the Duma to overturn a presidential decree . <p> If Mr. Yeltsin loses or does not run in this presidential election , the vote would represent the first democratic leadership succession in Russian history . The Duma results will help show who the strong presidential contenders may be . <p> The Duma seats 450 deputies . Half are elected from districts , much like the US House of Representatives . Half are divided in proportion to votes received by those parties that win at least 5 percent of the vote . Current estimates are that as few as four and as many as nine parties may break the 5 percent threshold . <p> But all projections are slippery . As one Kremlin analyst puts it : " Any voter could vote for almost anyone from anarchists to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party that ran the Soviet Union , the Communist Party is set for a strong comeback . The party is expected to win as much as 35 percent of the Duma seats - far more than any other party but also far short of a majority . <p> The Communist voters are concentrated among older Russians , who have seen their pensions and life savings become worthless in a few short years of runaway inflation . To them , the Soviet years were times of superpower status , safe streets , and affordable sausage - even if lines were long and quality was poor . <p> Today 's Communist Party is not quite the old breed . Leader Gennady Zyuganov quotes from the Bible and accepts private property . But the party platform makes clear that the Communists want the state to own and control the national distribution of goods and many key industries , and to restore subsidy levels to many large , failing enterprises . <p> Quote <p> Zyuganov on recent history : " The Soviet Union collapsed because the Communist Party claimed a monopoly on truth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't . " <p> Yabloko <p> The leading bloc ( political alliance ) among market-oriented democrats , Yabloko is led by reform economist Grigory Yavlinsky . ( Yabloko means " apple " in Russian , based on the initials of its founders . ) He has grown more popular than the more radical reformer Yegor Gaidar who brought Russia " shock therapy " and the rough first rounds of reform . <p> Mr. Yavlinsky 's Yabloko regards itself as the democratic opposition to the Yeltsin administration , which Yavlinsky accuses of creating a new ruling elite that replaces the old Communists . <p> Yavlinsky condemned the military assault on the rebel republic of Chechnya for its brutality and incompetence . He did not support Yeltsin 's use of force in 1993 against a rebellious , antidemocratic parliament . He would like to prune back the strong presidential powers that Yeltsin wrote into the Constitution . <p> Yabloko is expected to run a distant second or third behind the Communists . <p> Quote <p> Yavlinsky on his priorities : " First , it is necessary to correctly share powers between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the main task is to cure the economy . This can be done . " <p> Our Home is Russia <p> This bloc , sometimes called the " party of power , " was created last April at the prompting of Yeltsin advisers and is headed by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin . <p> Its appeal is stability . The bloc 's leaders hope that after years of suffering economic free fall , Russians will appreciate that the economy is stabilizing . But at the same time , the bloc faces deep Russian frustration with the status quo and the current political leadership . <p> Our Home is Russia is expected to overcome the 5 percent barrier to enter parliament , but it is unlikely to finish better than third among the blocs . <p> Quote <p> Chernomyrdin speaking to Russian enterprises : " There is no free money and there will be no free money . You have to learn new ways , look for creditors and investors , and sign contracts . " <p> Congress of Russian Communities <p> This movement sprung to the forefront of Russian politics when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A beefy former paratrooper with a voice like an idling diesel locomotive , General Lebed is one of the few Russian figures with a reputation for incorruptibility . He speaks in simple , colloquial Russian with brutal clarity . In many polls , he is the most popular political figure in Russia today . <p> Lebed and his fellow partisans would like to see a stronger state in Russia . He sees current foreign investment as Westerners ripping off Russian raw materials . Lebed 's strongest promise is to clean corruption out of Russia 's bureaucracies . <p> Quote <p> Lebed on Chechnya , where Moscow is trying to end its battle against rebel independence fighters : " Only today there were 23 instances of combat , and some idiots are trying to hold elections there ? " <p> Liberal Democratic Party Of Russia <p> Ultranationalist and media mischief-maker Vladimir Zhirinovsky is perhaps the most colorful character in Russian politics , but his party also won more votes than any other in the 1993 elections . This year , they are expected to do less well . Both the Communists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationalists who voted for Zhirinovsky in 1993 . <p> Zhirinovsky is a militant nationalist who promotes extending Russia 's borders into Kazakstan , Ukraine , and Belarus . He was the only parliamentary leader to support the invasion of Chechnya . He also is harshly anti-Western , anti-Semitic ( although part Jewish ) , and anti-Caucasian . <p> Quote <p> Zhirinovsky on Yeltsin : " He is like Brezhnev at the end of 1982 . He 's a puppet . They bring him in and bring him out . " <p> Women of Russia <p> One of the strongest parties in Russian politics , Women of Russia is a very pragmatic , centrist party that backs women 's rights ( although not in the Western feminist sense ) , social safety nets , and moderation in reforms . It strongly opposed the military intervention in Chechnya . <p> The higher the turnout on election day , the better Women of Russia are likely to do . Many of Russia 's less-committed voters are women , who are expected to vote for this least political of parties . It should easily surpass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second only to the Communists . <p> Quote <p> Chairwoman Yekaterina Lakhova on their agenda : " We try to support reforms which are not extreme .
