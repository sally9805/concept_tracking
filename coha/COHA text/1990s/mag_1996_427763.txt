What 's the state of race relations in the workplace these days ? The answer depends on whom you talk to . Some of us feel that things are getting better , while others have found that nothing much has changed . Most of us agree that we 're still struggling-often on a daily basis-to he appreciated and valued for the work we do . Things are better than they were 20 years ago . Today most corporations have embraced at least the idea of a diverse workplace , if not yet the reality . But vestiges of racism and segregation linger for the average African-Anerican worker . The most recent U.S. Census Bureau statistics confirm that we comprise 12.5 percent of the population-nearly 32 million strong . We 're the largest ethnic group both in the country and within the workforce . Jobs are harder to get and keep than they used to be . The current corporate trend is downsizing , which has bred a climate in which the perception of racial " preferences " has led to a backlash among many White workers . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversify Sometimes an indignity or slight is malicious and deliberate . Often it simply stems from a coworker 's ignorance . So we 're still fighting the good fight , and that can be demoralizing and degrading . What are some of the things you can do to make the situation better where you work ? Perhaps you have been confronted with one or more of the following workplace scenarios . We 've asked a group of leading experts on diversity and work issues to tell us the best way to handle them . I recently started a new job . The day before I began working " ny supervisor announced to the all-White staff that I was an " affirmative-action " hire , and they needed me to avoid a lawsuit . I 'm afraid people will think I 'm incompetent . What should I do ? This situation is an example of poor management skills with racist over tones . " Deal with your own insecurity first , " advises psychiatrist Price Cobbs , coauthor of Black Rage ( ( Basic Books ) and president of Pacific Management Systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But do n't go around trying to convince people that you 're not an affirmative-action hire . That 's a form of stereotyping , and since stereotypes are irrational , you wo n't be able to merely talk folks out of that perception . Do work hard and effectively , publicizing your successful accomplishments , and in time your actions will establish your reputation as a competent individual . " Shirley Harrison , director of diversity management for Philip Morris Companies , Inc. , which has offices in New York City , acknowledges , " It 's a cop-out to put such a label on an individual when it 's a known fact that in today 's competitive environment , no company can afford to hire any but the most competent employees , regardless of race . Calmly discuss the comments with your supervisor , and share the potential impact such a statement might have on his team . " He may not admit it , but your input will put him on notice that you 're aware of what was said and that you 're not intimidated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask your boss to visibly and personally show support for your work and skills . If he resists complying with this , plan to work your way off his team . " I 'm the only African-American in my office , and ever since the acquittal in the O.J. Simpson trial , I 've had to listen to rude comments about Black people from my coworkers . How should I respond ? No doubt about it-this is racism , plain and simple . And the onus is on you to nip it in the bud professionally . " Feel free to assert your opinion to coworkers as to how these comments make you feel , particularly as they seem comfortable enough asserting them , " advises Kevin Carter , vice-president and director of diversity and business development for McDonald &; Co . Investments , an investment and brokerage firm headquartered in Cleveland . " Tell them that their comments are a blatant indication of how they must feel about Blacks in general , " suggests Patrice Gilliam-Johnson , an industrial and organizational psychologist in Landover , Maryland , who specializes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opinions are just that-opinions . Voiced in the office , they 're inappropriate and a form of harassment , and you do n't have to deal with them . If the comments persist , bring the situation to the attention of your supervisor ; whose responsibility it is to make them stop . Should this fail , it then becomes your company 's problem , as there are legal ramifications for nonaction . About six months ago I was brought in to supervise a staff of ten that includes four White males . I get along fine with my supervisor ( a White man ) , but the White men I manage are acting out . They ignore me in the halls , openly disagree with me in meetings and generally undermine me . What 's my recourse ? A number of " isms " may be at work here , like racism , sexism or just plain negativism . What 's certain is that the behavior of these men smacks of insubordination . You 're their boss , so take charge . // " Bring the situation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his unbrella of power and support so htat it 's covering you , : says psychiatrist Cobbs . Next , deal with the uncooperative employees in one-on-one conferences , where you lay out your expectations for team performance as well as behavoir that will or wo n't be tolerated in your department . In a subtle way , you 're letting them know you 're the person who 'll be appraising them and that their path to success and recognition is through you . " " For added insurance you might start docunesting their aberrant behavior , " adds diversity expert Carter . " Then if their divisive antics persist , you will have built up a strong enough case for cutting them from your team , if necessary . " ' Patricia Reid-Merritt , professor and former coordinator of the social-work and African-American studies programs at Richard Stockton College in Pomona , New Jersey , notes : " It 's not necessary to be friends with your subordinates , but courtesy is a reasonable expectation . Do n't escalate the conflict by emotionally confronting the offenders . By keeping your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue . " I think my boss is a racist . He always has some snide remark to make about Black people but emphasizes that he feels " comfortable " enough with me to talk freely about " the problems " with Blacks . He seems to like me as a person , but he just does n't get it when it comes to racism . How should I handle him ? Whether he realizes it or not , your manager exhibits actions that are racially insensitive , and you need to educate him . It 's not unusual for people to act out contradictory values and behaviors , says Reid-Merritt , " and your boss 's efforts to make you an honorary White person while he denigrates other Black people is an example . " Brenda Schofield of New York , who 's an expert on corporate diversity , suggests that you have a heart-to-heart talk with your boss about his insensitivity , giving him concrete examples of his indiscretions . " You ca n't assume that everyone thinks before they speak , " she says , " and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let him know that his racist commentary makes that prospect difficult . " Schofield advises that you continue to call your boss on those remarks whenever he makes them , and eventually he will " get it . " " People who honestly believe they 're liberated and without prejudice are often the most difficult to reach , " says Iris Randall , president of New Beginnings , a Danbury , Connecticut , consulting firm for organizations in transition . " You might suggest that he call in an expert on diversity to work with the entire department , himself included , to bring sensitivity to his workplace . " I feel so isolated at work . I 'm the only African-American in my office , and I 'm often excluded from lunches and discussions . Is there anything I can do to change this ? Some assessment and introspection are in order here . First try to determine exactly what goes on during those lunches and discussions . Are they informal get-togethers where coworkers kick back and shoot the breeze , or are they forums where important jobrelated information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactions to be , you 'll probably have to make the first move . " Being excluded is somewhat part and parcel of being an " only " in the office , " notes psychologist GilliamJohnson , so do n't automatically assume the perceived snub is racially motivated . " Make some attempts to be included by extending lunch invitations to your peers or inviting yourself to group events , " advises Ivory Dorsey , author of Universal Appeal : The Bottom Line Benefit of Diversity ( Kendall-Hunt ) and president and founder of Golden Eagle Business Services , a consulting firm in Atlanta . " Once the initial discomfort wears off , your being included will likely become a natural occurrence . " You may want to do some self-assessment to make sure you 're being as friendly as you can be . " For AfricanAmericans in business , networking on all levels is n't a nicety , it 's a necessity , " says Carl Bryant of the Center for Creative Leadership in Greensboro , North Carolina . Do n't be afraid to invite your coworkers out for lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We tend to limit ourselves by instinctively gravitating to other African-Americans in social interactions , which can turn to isolation when we 're alone . We may not extend ourselves enough to meet other types of people , " Bryant suggests . One of my coworkers , who is also a close friend , was recently promoted to run our department . Some of our fellow workers feel that I 'll get preferential treatment because we 're both Black . What should we do ? Maintain the same standard of professional and productive performance that has established you as valued employees-and then let the chips fall where they may . " Understand that some of your colleagues will initially have this perception no matter what you do , so just do your respective jobs well , which wo n't lend credence to their assumption , " says John Aldrich , president of Aldrich Associates , a management-consulting firm in Shelton , Connecticut . And as the staff member , you should be careful not to put your friend in a situation where she has either to cover for you or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of preferential treatment . " You both will probably have to redefine the rules of your relationship , however , because they will change , " advises Anita Underwood , an organizational psychologist for Delta Consulting Group in New York City . " Your friendship , for the most part , will not exist in the workplace the way it once did , so be prepared to act accordingly . Assess up front whether or not you can both work together in this new capacity , and if you ca n't , as the subordinate , you might have to request reassignment to another department , " Underwood says . I feel that my ideas and contributions are always challenged because I 'm African-American . Am I being paranoid ? Probably not : African-Americans are traditionally expected to prove themselves , while their White counterparts are often simply accepted at face value . But it 's difficult , and sometimes selfdefeating , to try to prove racial bias every time it rears its ugly head . You 'll be better served by focusing instead on acquiring the communication style and skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morris ' Harrison , " Being challenged is part of working in an organizational system , so welcome to the club . Since you have this perception , it 's up to you to determine whether the challenges are appropriate . " Adds consultant and author Dorsey , " You can ask your work and nonwork support systems for clarification and feedback on your performance . Was your proposal sound , or did it have holes in it that deserved to be challenged ? If an idea you presented was rebuffed , only to be accepted when broached by another colleague , how was your coworker 's suggestion more palatable than what you said ? " " Criticism , when it 's constructive , can hone you into a more effective communicator , " says diversity expert Schofield . " The excellence that results will soon speak for itself , and you 'll find yourself being challenged less often because you 'll have become a part of the functioning system . " I 'm always left out of the loop when it comes to important decisions and general feedback about my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleagues are uncomfortable talking to me . What can I do to reverse this trend ? Put yourself into the loop by asking for what you need-and deserve . " It 's critical that you help your boss define the criteria for your success , " says psychiatrist Cobbs . " This includes frankly stating your need and expectation of regular feedback . " Cobbs stresses that you must not settle for social commentary ( " Your staff thinks you 're great-they all love you " ) , but rather ask for a skills- and performance-directed assessment ( " Your ability to absorb data is a valuable asset . That 's what 's needed to excel here " ) . Psychologist Gilliam-Johnson acknowledges that " Whites are sometimes ambivalent about giving us feedback , particularly if it 's negative , out of a fear that we 'll think it 's based on racism . " Your soliciting feedback will let management know you 're interested in your performance and open to criticism , which should eliminate the discomfort . You might also want to assess your own behavior to be sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Harrison . " Often it 's not what you say , but how you say it that can turn others off toward you . " I supervise a male African-American who is openly belligerent in his dealings with White customers and fellow employees . Because of complaints made against him , I 've had no choice but to bring him up on disciplinary charges . His response has been to label me a Tom for buckling under to pressure and not supporting " a brother . " What should I do Since this is a clear-cut management issue , you should respond to him as you would any other racist or counterproductive subordinate-with a swift and definitive reprimand . " Bring him into your office and lay down the law , " advises Harrison . " Let him know that his opinion of you is n't what 's at issue here-his ability to provide effective customer service is . And if his bias continues to get in the way of that , he 'll soon be seeking employment elsewhere . " " Without extending preferential treatment , African-Americans can sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-onone , in our language , ' and put them back on track , " observes Lorraine Johnson , Ph.D. , a clinical social worker specializing in workplace stress management in San Diego . " In a situation like this , you should assure this brother that your intention is not to undermine him , but that you wo n't allow him to undermine you either , " says Johnson . I 'm one of two African-Americans in my office . We 're friends , and it seems to bother other White workers whenever we 're together talking , be it about business or otherwise . They either make comments like " Uh , oh , what are you two plotting ? " or they rudely invite themselves into our conversation . Do we just grin and bear it ? It depends on how persistent and intrusive this behavior is . With all the other challenges facing Black women at work , in choosing your battles you might opt to simply overlook this one . However , this scenario is a common one in many similarly staffed workplaces , so your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior becomes bothersome enough , you might decide to put it gently in check . " If you 're truly conducting business , they can say what they want , " offers psychologist Underwood . " On the other hand , the comments might be cloaked observations that you two socialize too much , which does n't bode well if it 's true . You ca n't be fired for talking to someone , but you can be let go if you 're perceived as not doing your work . " Psychologist Gilliam-Johnson also sees this as a problem if the comments are made because others have noted that the two of you only interact with each other , to the exclusion of others in the company . " If this is true , you 're isolating yourselves , which will limit the data you get from the rest of the staff , " she says . As for that uninvited guest encroaching on your conversation , politely yet firmly inform the intruder that if your immediate attention is n't required , you 'll get back to her as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the issue of racism on the job , you can try these general coping strategies : Learn your prospective employer 's corporate culture , and determine whether your presence there will be a good fit before you join the organization . Do n't immediately attribute racially charged confrontations to racism . Any number of things , such as poor management , miscommunication or simple ignorance , may be at fault . Remember , your job is n't who you are-it 's simply what you do to earn a living . Your expanded role as wife , mother , community activist or volunteer more accurately defines you as the valuable , rounded human being you are . Find ways to deal with others ' negative behavior , because otherwise your work , attitude and health will begin to suffer as a result . Adopt some positive coping mechanisms ( spiritual affirmations , an exercise regimen , a support network ) that can operate as therapeutic stress reducers when you 're under pressure .
