The Ties That Bind // Daylon McCutcheon was nine years old when he asked his mother , Deborah Sterling , if he could play organized football . " I told him no , and he did n't play that year , " says Sterling . " I was afraid of the comparison . " // Daylon , you see , is the son of Lawrence McCutcheon , the former Los Angeles Ram running back . These days , as the leading rusher on USA Today 's top-ranked schoolboy team , La Puente ( Calif . ) Bishop Amat , Daylon can not escape comparison with his father . Last Friday night , in a 28-6 victory over Crespi High , Daylon rushed for 189 yards and scored all four of the Lancers ' touchdowns . For the season he has gained 1,575 yards on 150 carries and scored 22 touchdowns for 9-0 Bishop Amat. // " I 've never seen a kid with better lateral movement , " says Lancer coach Tom Salter . While Lawrence was more powerful , Salter says that " Daylon 's a slasher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's pretty exciting when the ball is in his hands , " says McCutcheon the elder , now a Ram scout , who has watched Daylon play five times in the last two seasons . " But I ca n't take any credit . I did n't have a lot of contact with him . " // Deborah and Lawrence met while they were students at Colorado State in the early ' 70s . McCutcheon was drafted by the Rams in 1972 , and Sterling moved to Los Angeles after graduating in ' 74 . Daylon was born on Dec. 9 , 1976 , but Lawrence was never anything more to him than his biological father , though he has paid child support since Daylon was born . // From the time he was about 2 ? until he was 16 , Daylon saw his father only once . That was in 1986 , when Deborah took 10-year-old Daylon to a Ram practice . " We were running around , having players autograph our pennants , " says Daylon . " This man asked me if I wanted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , the three of them talked for a few minutes . " Lawrence spoke to me the whole time , " says Deborah , " but he never took his eyes off Daylon. " // Though Daylon and Deborah lived near Lawrence while Daylon was growing up , it was n't until 1992 that Lawrence called Daylon to meet with him again . " Both of us are kind of stubborn , " says Daylon . " My attitude was , If he wants to talk to me , let him come to me . " The two had dinner , and the conversation was " awkward , " says Daylon . " But today we 're pretty good friends . " // So are Deborah and Lawrence . The two sometimes sit together at Bishop Amat games , along with Myna , Lawrence 's wife of 12 years , and their 10-year-old son , Marcus . Does Sterling , a substitute teacher , think that Daylon has suffered because he did n't come to know his father until recently ? " If you know Daylon , you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't Daylon 's loss . " // Turnaround // If Mike Jones 's entry in the Fitch High yearbook listed only a few of his activities since junior high , it might read like this : drug dealer , student of the month , marijuana abuser , homecoming court , gang leader , co-captain of the football team . // Only 18 , Jones has already lived two lives . After running away from his home in Brooklyn when he was 14 , he ended up prowling the streets of New Haven , Conn . As a young teen he was arrested a dozen times . " I used to carry G-bundles 50-bag supplies of cocaine and make $600 a night , " he says . " But I 'd spend a thousand a week on weed . " // He got high every morning smoking marijuana dipped in embalming fluid . He had his own gang , the Knockout Posse , and carried a .357 Magnum . " I hit a kid in the head with a brick once , " says Jones . " Another time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed . " // After several stints in detention centers and reform school , Jones landed in a group home for teenage boys , the New England Adolescent Treatment Center ( NEATC ) , in Groton , Conn . There he met a counselor named Ron Adams . " I had n't known Mike long when I told him that if he could quit smoking cigarettes for a month , I 'd take him out to dinner , " says Adams . " Three days later he told me we 'd have to start over because he 'd smoked one . He did n't have to tell me that . That 's when I began to think Mike might have a chance . " // While living at NEATC , Jones enrolled at Fitch , which also is in Groton . He ran track as a freshman , but when people encouraged him to don pads , he balked for what seemed a bizarre reason to anyone familiar with his past . " I was afraid of getting hurt , " says Jones . // Eventually he relented , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 yards per carry for Fitch , which is 9-0 . Last Saturday , in the Falcons ' 42-0 win over Ledyard High , Jones rushed for 144 yards and two touchdowns on eight carries . But his most impressive statistic is his academic rank : 65th in a class of 228. // Jones now lives with his foster parents , Anthony and Rachel Evans , in nearby Mystic . Says his coach , Mike Emery , " You will not find a better kid across the whole country . Mike 's committed to turning his life around . " // Says Jones , " I feel like I 'm living in a dream . " // Fake-Out // You could n't dream up a better college prospect than Arthur McDuffy of Mount Pleasant ( Miss . ) Christian Academy . Here 's what The 1994 G&amp;W Summer Report , a recruiting sheet , wrote about McDuffy , a 6 ' 6 " , 300-pound senior whom it listed as a preseason first-team All-America : " The No. 1 rated offensive line prospect in ... the entire SEC area .... Bench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ champion in 1993 .... Has 4.0 GPA at state 's top private school . " // Why , McDuffy sounds almost too good to be .... // " Nope , he never went to school here , " says Rodney Jones , the coach at Mount Pleasant during what would have been the McDuffy years . " Only nine players came out for the team last year , and none was named McDuffy . " In fact , Mount Pleasant did n't field a team last season , and this year the school did n't even exist . // When informed of the hoax , G&amp;W analyst Phil Grosz said , " You 're kidding me . " Grosz , like the analysts at Street &amp; Smith 's College Football , Tom Lemming 's Prep Football Report and Max Emfinger 's National Bluechips Recruiting Service , was duped into listing McDuffy after seeing his name on tout sheets traced to an unpublished draft of the Jackson , Miss. , Clarion-Ledger 's roster of the top seniors in the state . An anonymous caller had alerted the newspaper to McDuffy 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for McDuffys listed in Mississippi , he would have found one real Arthur who played high school football . But no analyst is likely to have touted the 5 ' 7 " , " 200-something , " 41-year-old Indianola resident . " I was fairly good , " says Arthur , a former tight end at Gentry High . " But definitely nothing to brag on . " // Kentucky Rifles // Upon spotting Tim Couch , the quarterback of Leslie County ( Ky . ) High , warming up in the north end zone of Louisville 's Cardinal Stadium last Saturday , Chris Redman sprinted toward him . " Good luck tonight , " Redman said , extending his hand to Couch , a 6 ' 5 " junior . // " Thanks , " said Couch . " And congratulations on your record . " // Earlier that afternoon , on the same field , Redman , a 6 ' 3 " senior , had quarter-backed his Louisville Male team to a 76-6 defeat of Holy Cross , tossing for 251 yards and five touchdowns . The record Couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which surpassed the previous mark of 54 , set by Kirk Saul of Turkey Valley ( Texas ) High in 1986 . Redman 's nine-yard throw on Saturday to his best friend , Brian Evans , gave him 55 . A 62-yarder to wideout Ibn Green pushed the record to 56 . Unbeknownst to Couch , Redman had also broken Couch 's state career-passing-yardage mark of 7,192 . Redman upped it to 7,369. // When the day was over , Couch was accepting some congratulations of his own . In a 45-28 win over Knox Central , he completed 21 of 29 passes for 350 yards , leapfrogging Redman in the record book by 173 yards . // The Bluegrass State had never seen two bluer-chip quarterbacks on the same field on the same day . Both have led their teams to 11-0 marks . Redman is a coach on the field  --  as a lad he bent a wire hanger into the shape of a headset to emulate his dad , Bob , the coach at Male . Of Chris 's 56 touchdown passes , 49 were thrown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his son would already own the national career touchdown-pass mark of 126 ( he 's at 101 ) . // Couch has another year to establish more schoolboy records . His opponents do n't seem to relish this fact . Said Knox Central coach Robert ( Hooker ) Phillips after watching Couch pick apart his team , " Couch is one of the best high school quarterbacks I 've seen in I ca n't remember how long . There 's no comparison between Couch and Redman . " // Actually , Coach , there are lots of comparisons . // Unrivaled Rivalries // Massillon versus McKinley ( page 34 ) is only one example of a high school game that can be as important as the entire season .
