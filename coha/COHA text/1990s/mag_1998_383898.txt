A Grand Tour of Modern British Eccentricity <p> I LIVE IN NEW ENGLAND , A REGION THAT TAKES PRIDE IN ITS WEIRDOS , THE STRANGE , hyper-individualistic people who stubbornly pursue some dream , some concept , some personal style that to them has great meaning but to their neighbors seems bonkers . The great 19th-century poet Emily Dickinson of Amherst , Massachusetts , for example , always wore white , never left her room , wrote love poems though so far as anyone knows she 'd never had a lover , and hid the poems in little boxes . <p> Most New England towns have a character who is building Noah 's Ark in his backyard , or who writes letters-to-the-editor in Sanskrit , or whose parlor is full of household pets he 'd stuffed when they died . We chuckle at these irregulars , but we respect their right to do it their way . As my mother used to say in defense of the local oddball , " Now , son , he has his own idea . " <p> Last spring I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second day the subject suddenly remembered an obligation in Marrakesh . At loose ends , having a pint in a pub , I picked up a newspaper and read an article about a Dr. David Weeks , a clinical neuro-psychologist at the Royal Edinburgh Hospital who had done a ten-year scientific study of more than 1,000 modem-day eccentrics . Fascinated , I phoned Weeks and asked if I could pop up to Edinburgh and see him . <p> He met me at the gate of the rambling Victorian hospital . A precise-looking man of about 5o , dressed in a starched white coat , he was thinly thatched and had a closely trimmed , reddish-brown beard . We went to his office where , speaking with a mild Scottish burr and with zest for his topic , he described his study as an effort to examine a psychological phenomenon , eccentricity , that science had never paid much attention to . He had found the candidates for the study first through notices put up on bulletin boards at universities , pubs and supermarkets in Edinburgh , he said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the ads produced . Weeks , or his partner , interviewed each of the legitimate-sounding candidates and gave them extensive psychological tests . <p> " A lot of people , " Weeks said , " assume that eccentricity is a mild form of madness . We found that not to be the case at all . Neurotics , for example , know they 're different and are miserable about it . Eccentrics know they 're different and they could n't be more pleased . They glory in their difference . They go to great lengths to maintain that difference . " <p> Eccentrics , the study revealed , are n't dysfunctional . It 's just that their thought processes are , well , unusual . Their IQs are high , perhaps in the top 10o to x5 percent ; a large proportion of the extremely gifted are eccentric . Eccentrics are happier than the rest of us , Weeks found ; they are optimistic , never discouraged . They have low levels of stress - which may be why they 're much healthier and live ten years longer , on average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in Britain at least , male . <p> I asked Weeks if eccentricity was alive and well in Britain . Were the Isles still producing flamboyant rebels like the Londoner who , to settle a score with the post office , is said to have bought an elephant , pasted 200-worth of stamps to its rump , and mailed it to an address in Northumberland ? Were there still , I wondered , characters like Jack Mytton and the Countess of Eglintoune ? <p> Mytton , you 'll recall , Squire of Halston , Shropshire , in the early 19th century , was a passionate follower of the hounds and a perfect case in point for the Weeks assertion that " overboard is the only way most eccentrics know how to go . " He owned 150 pairs of riding breeches and kept some two thousand hounds . At one of his notorious dinner parties he appeared in full hunting costume , mounted on a bear . In the ensuing panic , while his guests dove out windows , Mytton bellowed " Tallyho ! " and spurred his mount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mytton came to a sad end . Tormented by a bad case of hiccups , he sought to cure it by setting himself on fire . He was fatally burned but managed to get off a quite acceptable parting remark . " Well , " he cried , " the hiccup is gone , by God ! " <p> Susanna Kennedy , the Countess of Eglintoune , was one of the great beauties of the 18th century . She boarded hundreds of rats , and each evening she summoned a score of her favorites to her dining room by rapping on the paneling . At this invitation her guests appeared and joined her at table . After the meal she would murmur a command , and the rats would retreat in a seemly manner . <p> Weeks replied that yes , definitely , there were plenty of modem British eccentrics carrying on in the grand old tradition of Susanna and Jack  --  approximately one classic , full-time eccentric for every 10,000 members of the general population . " But there 's a difference . In the old days eccentricity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had the leisure and the money required of eccentricity on the grand scale ; for the lower orders life was too grim and earnest . Nowadays , like so many other things , eccentricity has become middle class . But these latter-day specimens are true British eccentrics nonetheless . " <p> I spent two days with Weeks , pelting him with questions about the people he 'd studied until , feeling the need to resume the practice of his profession , he said , " Look , the best way for you to learn about eccentrics is to go meet some . " He offered to set me up with a half dozen , and I jumped at the chance . I rented a car and , with a list of names and addresses he provided , set out on a 1,500-mile circuit of Britain . <p> It began with a stunning drive to Inverness , way up in the Scottish Highlands at the head of Loch Ness . In a farm cottage ten miles out of town lived John Slater , a man who indeed marched to his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pajamas . <p> John in his youth was a Royal Marine commando . " There came a time , " he said , " when I lost interest in learning how to kill a man with my thumbs . " He went to live among the poor of London , so that he could help humanity and learn more about himself . ( Both these goals , Weeks says , are typical eccentric preoccupations . ) His first eccentric act to achieve notoriety was volunteering to spend six months in a cage in the London Zoo as a human exhibit , to raise funds for the conservation of the panda bear . The zoo authorities , he said , shortsightedly declined . <p> His next , again intended as a fund-raiser , was a walk along the very edge of Scotland 's ragged coastline - 3,000 miles , he says , if you tread the very brims of every bay and inlet and peninsula , of which there are countless . For all his effort he raised only about 1,000 . Clearly his next venture had to be more spectacular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his girlfriend . " I 'll walk from Land 's End to John O'Groat 's "  --  which is to say , the entire length of Britain . <p> " Done to death , John , " his girlfriend retorted . <p> " I 'll do it barefoot , then . " His girlfriend sighed . " And in my pajamas ! " She lifted an eyebrow . Taking that as her benediction , he got into a pair of white pajamas with red and green stripes and hitchhiked down to the starting point , at the tip of Cornwall . He was accompanied by his dog Guinness , a Labrador , who wore leather booties John had made for him . <p> " The Cornish roads were the worst , " he said . " The gravel at the verges was flinty and sharp , and mixed into it were splinters of broken glass . By the second day my feet were septic . From that day till the end of the walk , I said ' Ouch ' every fourth step . Once , at night , I accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my toenail . Kind of took the humor out of it , for a bit . " <p> Despite all , John managed to cover 12 miles a day . After four months and many adventures , he limped into John O'Groat 's , Britain 's northernmost point , where a crowd awaited him . " I 'm seldom speechless , " John said , " but I just stood there without a word to say . I thought to myself , ' It is possible ! You can if you think you can . There 's nothing to stop you . ' It was n't so much a sense of achievement I felt . It was more that I 'd been led along by something much greater than me . " <p> Over the years , John exasperated his way through a number of marriages and relationships , as eccentrics tend to do . Particularly trying for his last wife was his penchant for going off to live for three and four months at a time in a cave on the Scottish coast . Twice a day , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to the back of the cave . Sitting there in the dark and the damp , he listened enraptured to the ceaseless chatter of the wave-tossed pebbles . " You realize that the planet 's breathing , that the same energy that is moving those stones is also moving your heart . And the colors ! The longer you 've been in the dark , the more its beauty hits you . " <p> Now 60 and white-bearded , his blue eyes still atwinkle with fresh enthusiasm , John no longer goes to the caves - to the relief of his companion , a shy , sensible young woman named Karlin Bowie . He pours all his efforts into getting financial support for the spreading of his message , which emphasizes vegetables , vitamins and natural healing . He plans to deliver his views through Muddy the Frog , a large hand-puppet he has created . So far he and Muddy have n't found their backer , but hopes remain high . Irrepressibly high hopes against stimulatingly high odds are , after all , the eccentric 's stock-in-trade . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Yorkshire , which apparently is to eccentricity what Sweden is to depression . I went first to the town of Malton in North Yorkshire , where a man named Colin Newlove had achieved a degree of local fame as the Jack Mytton of his generation  --  not for riotous parties or for radical hiccup cures , but in the category of Unusual Mounts . <p> Like John Slater , Colin Newlove relishes a challenge , in particular the challenge involved in training animals . As a boy he took a pack of badgers ( " A wild thing is a badger , " Newlove said ) and taught them to come when called . As a man he makes his living training horses . His specialty is taking racetrack rejects  --  horses with behavior problems  --  and making them into winners . <p> He also breeds bulls . It occurred to him one day that if his best bull , William , won a prize at the upcoming agricultural show at Bishop Wilton , it would be nice if the animal bowed to the judges . " You 're wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spittle Beck pub . " Bulls ca n't be trained . They 're too headstrong . Never been done . " <p> That kind of remark only stiffens the true eccentric 's resolve . " I like to plow me own furrow , " he told me . " I do n't like to be following what everyone else is doing . " <p> Within the fortnight Colin taught William to bow . " Once I saw that I could get through to him , I got ambitious . First I trained him to kneel while I stood astride his neck . Then I thought , ' Would n't it be lovely if ! could ride him ? ' Before long , he was letting me saddle him up and mount . So there he was  --  something never seen before , a bull with manners . I could rein him back like a dressage horse , get him to do fight figure eights . It was amazing , the ease I could control him with , especially considering his weight . " <p> Colin and William then took their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beck pub , that nest of naysayers . Colin rode William up to the bar , where a dumbfounded ex-doubter bought them each a Guinness . Then on to Lucy 's China Shop , the largest in Norwich , to refute the insulting old simile for clumsiness . " When the cashier saw us coming , " Colin said , " she cleared out . " Up and down the aisles they went , bull and rider , never so much as rattling a saucer . <p> Where was all this leading ? It was leading to the greatest challenge of Colin 's career  --  to hunt with the Derwent Beagles . The problem was that yelping dogs tend to frighten cattle : William might bolt , with Colin aboard . If that happened , the soaks at the Spittle Beck would never let him hear the end of it . <p> When the day came , Colin , dressed in hunting black , trotted William up to the crowd of beaglers having their stirrup cups before the hunt began . Looks of disbelief , then guffaws . William stayed serene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beagles surged forth , he was right in there with them , as if bred for the sport . He did n't canter , exactly , but thundered along at a good clip , acquitting himself well when there were ditches to jump . The feat was shown on TV , and man and beast soon had invitations to hunts all over England . <p> The story ends badly . As is sometimes the case with human beings , bulls are valued more highly for their beef than for their brains , and William , the world 's most educated bull , I gathered , went off to accompany numerous Yorkshire puddings . For Colin , things have n't been the same since . " I manage to keep busy with other challenges , " he said . " I trained a bull named Taurus to walk a narrow plank , which is about the last thing a bull wants to do , and a bull named Oxo to get into bed and lie down . It was clever stuff . I even trained a horse to jump over a cow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse canters toward a cow , the sound of the hoofbeats panics the cow . The cow has to have confidence , and the horse has to have confidence . I did it by putting them together in the horse 's stable box for six months . People would say , ' What on earth are you doing with that cow ? ' " <p> One evening at dinner , Colin revealed his training maxim . " I never reward the animals , " he said . " They have to like doing it . " The principle applies to eccentrics as well . If they were in it for rewards , gold or glory , eccentrics would be as rare as bulls with manners . <p> In his book , Eccentrics : A Study of Sanity and Strangeness , Dr. Weeks speaks of " costume eccentrics . " Some eccentrics , he says , become so closely identified with a certain historical figure that they in effect become that figure , even dressing and speaking as that person would have . One of Weeks ' subjects fixated so intensely on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his name to that of his hero . Every day , he dresses as a medieval huntsman  --  all in green , with peaked and feathered cap , complete with longbow and a quiver full of arrows . <p> Robin Hood , alas , was unavailable when I was passing through ( out adjusting local income disparities , I assumed ) . But I was fortunate to spend several hours with Captain Nathaniel Helliwell , an officer in Oliver Cromwell 's Roundhead army during the 17th-century English Civil War . <p> Helliwell is the persona taken on by a pale , soft-spoken ex-bus-driver named David Shorrocks  --  or rather , as David would state it , Helliwell took on David . The spirit of this long-deceased cavalry officer , who fought against the Cavaliers of King Charles I , came to David , as he put it , at a terrible time  --  when , clinically depressed and miserable in his job , he was near breakdown . <p> " He became me unseen friend and helper , " David said . " Over a period of seven years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening , he set me upon a character- and confidence-building course . It not only combated me illness but helped me reach me full potential in all kinds of fields that would otherwise have been closed to me . " <p> David lives in a farm village overlooking a broad valley in West Yorkshire . His house was once a church ; the graveyard is right outside his door . The walls are hung with Roundhead memorabilia and paraphernalia . There 's a poleax , a formidable double-edged sword he had a smithy make for him , a replica of the blade Captain Helliwell must have carried , and a steel helmet . On the anniversaries of important English Civil War battles that took place in the year 1643  --  he is focused exclusively on 1643 ; 1642 and 1644 are of no interest to him  --  he dresses for combat . He tugs on a stout leather tunic he had someone make for him from the original design . Next he dons his breastplate , his boots and thick leather gloves . Then he grabs his sword and two flintlock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steed , Oliver , is stabled . Once mounted , he trots Oliver down the highway to the battlefield : Captain Helliwell rides again . Heads snap , one can imagine , when David and Oliver clop down the main shopping street of an English town on a Saturday afternoon . <p> At the battle site , David stands by for emanations from the captain 's spirit . Helliwell , David says , communicates via " obstacles and deceptively simple challenges , as well as clues and cryptic messages , curious coincidences , peculiar experiences and inner perceptions . " One message David is particularly eager to receive is the one revealing the whereabouts of the modem-day counterpart of Goodwyfe Kathrynn , Helliwell 's beloved spouse . " She 's out there , " said David , who described himself as a lonely man , " I know that . She 's waiting for me . I just hope I find her soon . " <p> As I prepared to leave David Shorrocks , he asked me if by chance my next appointment was with Jake MangleWurzel . When I replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake is n't your normal eccentric , " he said forebodingly , unconscious of his oxymoron . " He can be ... a bit strong . " <p> Jake lives ten miles away , in a township near the city of Huddersfield . I had no trouble finding his farmhouse . Large white letters painted on one side proclaim it THE CRAZIEST COTTAGE IN CREATION . An outside stairway supports Jake 's Waterfall of Toilets . Seven toilets , one on every other step , are placed so that each empties into the bowl of the one next below ; rain flows off the roof and into Toilet x , which debouches into Toilet z , and so on . The house and yard are festooned with bizarre junk , much of it fashioned into absurd contraptions . Toilets , I saw , were a favorite motif . There was , for example , a motorbike fitted with a toilet seat , a little kitchen sink ( " It 's all plumbed in , " Jake later told me ) and on its rear fender a very realistic toy machine gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had two masts - the mainmast bore a lightning rod and the mizzenmast the Union Jack ; strung between the masts was a clothesline with laundry hanging from it . <p> As I approached , dogs barked and Jake loped out to greet me . He was a tall man , well over six feet , with alarming blue eyes and a bramble of red beard . He wore a moldering Lord Nelson-type admiral 's hat with a white feather stuck into it . When he reached me he whipped a sword from a scabbard and pointed it at me . But my time had not come . He lay the tip of the sword upon my shoulder and said , " Prepare to be knighted . " He cleared his throat . " I , Sir Thomas Henry Erasmus Occupier , King of the Eccentrics and royal monarch of the extraordinary English kingdom of Wonderful Wurzel-Land , bestow this honorary knighthood upon Thomas Condom in acknowledgment of the masterful magazine article to be crafted for his own people , the citizens of the United States . " Under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warning from David Shorrocks  --  I decided not to chide him with the old admonition never to make a joke on a person 's name because that person has already heard it . <p> He raised the sword from my shoulder ; it had left a small oil stain on my raincoat  --  anointing oil , Jake explained . " There , that 's done , " he said , rescabbarding . " Let 's get on with it . " <p> Later he told me he had changed his legal surname to The Occupier because he received a quantity of mail addressed " To the Occupier " ( as does , of course , every British householder ) . He even has bank accounts in that name . It was clear he thought it a wonderful spoof . His life , as it turned out , was one endless send-up . On one occasion he fastened a sign to the rail of a high bridge favored by local suicides : IT SHOULD BE POINTED OUT THAT LEAPING FROM THIS BRIDGE IS EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH . - DEP'T . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one , I can tell you , " he said . " The local authorities asked the Department of Health to explain itself . ' No , no , we did n't put it up ! ' So they took it down . And it was just a simple statement of fact ! " <p> When Jake takes to the motorway in one of his magnificent vehicles  --  the motorbike or his old schoolbus with the windmill on top  --  bobbies frequently pull him over-which of course he thoroughly enjoys . " Once a bobby asked me why the windmill . ' To charge the battery , ' I said , which was balderdash , but he accepted it and let me proceed . In America they would have tossed me in the looney bin , but the English indulge their eccentrics . " <p> Jake 's eccentricity , he insisted , is instinctive , not contrived . " Some people spend their lives deliberately being outrageous , " he said . " I 'm not in favor of that . A lot of me life is outrageous , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Jake was born John Day , 6o years before , to an unsuspecting couple in the Yorkshire village of Marsh  --  which entitles him , he pointed out , to call himself a Martian . He showed me his photo in a school yearbook ; he looked as docile and innocent as a boy soprano during the Te Deum . " I was trained as an engineer , " he told me , " then I served three disastrous years in the air force . Afterward I held all kinds of jobs , but nothing seemed to have much meaning for me . I was miserable a lot of the time . Me marriage went down the drain . Everything went down the drain . <p> " Now , there are various means of escape from failure : You can go on the bottle , take pills , go to the shrink , turn to religion . I did n't do any of them . I changed me name to Jake Jonathan Zebedee Mangle-Wurzel , and I just surged off on a self-induced manic euphoria . I started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I own the house and the land it stands on , so the town council ca n't stop me from doing anything . I was determined to do this with me life , not knowing where it would lead . I thought at first it was just a lark , that it would last just a few months , until that November , and then I 'd stop meself and say , ' At least I 've had six months of damned good fun . ' But I 've been in business now for over 2o years ! It 's an extraordinary achievement , if I do say so meself . " <p> A face appeared from around the corner of the house next door . A neighbor , a woman , was scowling at Jake , as you well could imagine a neighbor of Jake 's would do . She waved her arms at me and mimed , Do n't encourage him . <p> The most notable feature of Jake 's place was a large concrete receptacle near the door  --  his tomb . " I 've had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " It is me final ambition to top meself . You call it suicide . When you have nothing to live for except pain , you should get your family and friends together , shake hands with them , and then top yourself . I want to be buried in that tomb in the middle of a two-ton concrete block with a tube coming out of me mouth . The tube goes up to the surface . That way , when me friends come round , say at Christmas , and want to celebrate , they can pour one down the tube for old Jakey . That 's the way to be immortal ! " <p> The tomb already has occupants . " Me second wife , the beautiful Pepa , she 's buried there . And then me son , Manoyle , he died 19 months ago , he 's down there too . I used to call him me son because I loved him so much . But actually he was four-legged , me canine companion ; the beautiful Pepa was his mother . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a kind of preview of what 's going to happen to me . " Manoyle got his name when he fell down a manhole , or " manoyle " in Yorkshire . <p> " Because I ca n't have a normal carry-on with me two-legged family or many others , I create me closest relationships with canines . They are me family . " <p> Jake 's loyalty to his family has been put to the test . <p> " About six years ago , " he said , " I needed some money and decided to seek a job driving wagons trucks , which is something I used to do . I went down to this agency , and I took Manoyle with me , me four-legged son . I told meself , ' Now Jake , you need this job , so be sensible , be serious , be practical , forget about Wonderful Wurzel-Land , otherwise you have no chance . ' <p> " The girl gave me application and she said , ' Oh , that 's a nice little dog you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just had to tell her straight that it was n't a dog . I heard meself saying , ' This is me son , Manoyle Ramsbottom . His mother was me second wife , and she was the best wife I ever had . ' And I just got carried away with it , and before I knew , the whole thing came flooding after . <p> " And then I saw she was shrinking from me , she had a strange look , and she snatched back the application . I 'd started out that day struggling to present myself as a person who was capable of taking on traditional employment . And I could n't . This bizarre life runs so deep in the marrow of me bones now . Selling out on me created reality ... me house , me inventions , me four-legged family ... I wo n't do it . It 's me brainchild , me baby . It 's just too precious to give up . " <p> Leaving Wonderful Wurzel-Land , pressing south and east , I worried that in comparison with Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need n't have fretted . When I met John Ward , for example , the eccentric inventor of Northamptonshire , he was wearing an immense bow tie and enormous white-framed spectacles , and the gray hair around his bald head fluffed out as if electrified . ( " I am not bald , " he maintained . " It 's a reverse Mohawk . " ) <p> John is best known , perhaps , as the inventor of the bra warmer . " It occurred to me , " he said in the most rococo regional accent of my entire trip , " that it must be dreadful for women to put on their ice-cold brassieres on chilly English mornings . So I mounted my wife 's hair dryer on a stand and led the hot air up to two semispheres I made from the two halves of a copper toilet-tank float . You just drape your bra over the copper globes and flick the switch , and by the time you 've brushed your teeth , your bra is downright cozy . " <p> I asked him how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while for these things to catch on , " he said . <p> We went to a restaurant and ordered drinks . When John excused himself to go to the loo , I noticed there was something floating in his drink  --  a small black ball with short stubby projections . Good grief , a miniature harbor mine ! <p> " Oh , that 's a useful little gadget , " he explained when he returned . " You know how at a party you set your drink on a table and somebody walks by , picks it up and drinks it for you ? So I made this as a warning to the careless : ' This is not your drink , it 's mine . ' " <p> Jake Mangle-Wurzel is out to shock . John Ward is out to delight . " I enjoy what I do , " he said . " you come into the world with nothing and you leave it with nothing , unless you put a roof-rack on your coffin . Let 's have some giggles , then . " <p> A maintenance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for practical inventions , but he represses them . " I 've known so many people , " he explained , " who are absolutely exhausted from trying to push an idea . I said to myself , ' Ah , the hell with it , I 'll go to the funny side . ' " And so instead of a better computer chip he invented the musical frying pan  --  one verse of The Yellow Rose of Texas and your egg is done  --  and the electric spoon , for stirring your tea . He created a machine that converts electioneering handouts into toilet paper ( a product he called " a tissue of lies " ) , and an automatic head-washer that operated on the principle of the car wash . When he tired of the endless repeats of the Royal Wedding on the telly , he went out to his garage and built the Tri-baff - a trimaran made of three bathtubs bolted together and propelled by a ten-horse outboard . The invention that best displayed his gift for whimsy was an earthbound , polka-dotted helicopter mounted atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a spin , the neighbors start twitching their curtains . <p> I asked his wife , Janet , what it was like to live with a full-time escapee from Monty Python 's Flying Circus . She smiled indulgently . " I 'm used to him , you see . I do n't think anything of it . " For his children , however , it was another matter . They were proud of him , Janet said , but a bit embarrassed . When Dad was out demonstrating his barmy helicopter , his teen-aged daughters had been known to sneak around the privet hedge looking as if they wanted the earth to open and swallow them up . <p> My odyssey so to speak , , came to an end at a farrmhouse in West Putford , Devon , in England 's far southwestern corner . There dwells Ann Atkin , who owns well over 1,00 garden gnomes and exhibits them in her Gnome Reserve down the lane . Each year tens of thousands of people thread the narrow , winding roads to West Putford and pay just under three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Reserve . They see gnomes peeping from behind stumps , gnomes fishing in the brook , gnomes sleeping on beds of moss  --  gnomes doing many of the everyday things non-gnomes do . <p> It is not the owning of the gnomes or the exhibiting of them that qualifies Ann Atkin as an eccentric , anymore than owning Disneyland made Walt a weirdo ; quite the contrary , it was good business . The thing that makes Ann , um , ah , exceptional is that she believes in gnomes . <p> " The gnomes are spiritual guides , " she told me gingerly , clearly aware that what she was saying might sound strange to the uninitiated . " They came for me and took me on an inner journey , if you like . You can be sitting right here in this room , and the gnomes can take you over the mountains , under the sea . They can take you into the song of a bird , and you can live in the birdsong . You can travel free . The gnomes unfolded parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious mind . They know more about what 's happening to me than I know myself . Does that make any sense ? " <p> I nodded thoughtfully . <p> " They are intermediaries between you and your inner self . " <p> Now this , I whispered to myself , is n't eccentric , it 's downright dotty . But wait . Ann herself was n't dotty at all . A warm and intelligent woman in her middle years , her eyes made large by thick glasses , Ann radiated sanity and , gnomes aside , normality . She had none of the mannerisms of the eccentrics I had met  --  what Dr. Weeks calls " pressured speech " and " tangentiality " and " exaggerated self-reference . " Furthermore , she was a gifted artist , a graduate of the Royal Academy of Art ; her intricate paintings of complex , petaled forms with little Adam and Eve figures rising from them showed what seemed to me considerable competence . <p> And so what if she believed in gnomes ? J.R.R. Tolkien made a great to-do over hobbits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third party , would believing in gnomes seem any more exotic than believing  --  as do the Archbishop of Canterbury and I , along with millions of others  --  that water can be changed into wine , and wine into blood ? I decided that if grumpy little men in pointy hats had made Ann the person she was , it was a great recommendation for gnome-power . <p> " What are gnomes like ? " I asked Ann as we walked toward my car . <p> " What are gnomes like ? " she repeated . " Gnomes are old as the hills and young as a child . That 's how I feel-old as the hills and young as a child . " <p> I got into my car and lowered the window to say goodbye . Ann was studying me intently . " You , " she said , " may be a gnome . " <p> When I got home two days later , I conveyed this perception to my wife . " Well , " she said , " it would explain quite a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my plane , I phoned Dr. Weeks and reported in . Before I d left him to start my trip , six eccentrics ago , he had given me the test he 'd given all the subjects in his study , questions designed to winkle out eccentricity and distinguish it from the neurotic behaviors . I expected him to tell me I 'd scored as mildly eccentric . Like most of Weeks ' eccentrics , after all , I was healthy , happy , intelligent and a firstborn . Furthermore , for 2o years I 'd kept bees on the roof of my townhouse in Manhattan . I 'd liked all the eccentrics I met and admired their courage and flair , and after two weeks of saturation exposure I had begun to identify with them . <p> " You scored 50 , " Weeks said . " That 's right in the middle . You 're normal . " <p> Normal ? Normal ? I 'd never been so insulted in my life . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : John Ward and his walking chair . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late William . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : David Shorrocks , a.k.a .
