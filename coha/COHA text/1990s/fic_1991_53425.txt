CANDLE FIRE BURNS the paraffin clear . Glass contained , it lasts twenty-four hours . Remembrance of the day of death . Yardzeit . Commemoration of the anniversary of the day of death . In the twentyfifth hour , I clean the little glass and set it on my desk to collect paper clips . <p> I have lived forty years . Lit a dozen yardzeit candles for her , my grandmother . Lit one for him , my father . <p> Sour dough . Seed crunch . Brings them . <p> Pale butter . Salt stars . Takes me . <p> We meet between worlds . <p> Dim visits in winter-thin light . <p> My grandmother twists the meat , white-veined , air-browned . Flaps it down against the cool drainboard . Blood runs ( slap ) from the red inside as though it is alive . Metal undulations catch the thin flow . The meat drains steadily , easing old life out . <p> I am twelve years old . I bleed now , too . <p> Ellen , she says , put more salt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy hand . She bleeds it to the letter of the Dietary Law . She 'd squeeze it like a sponge , if she could . <p> She is square . As wide at the hip as at the shoulder . More than age , this is her natural shape . She moves like a carton ( stockings rolled below the knee ) on side-to-side legs . <p> She is modern . She sports pink-rimmed glasses shaped like teardrops . The latest style , she says , and wiggles the points which protrude at each temple . Her eyes loom behind thick lenses like fly eyes . They swing kaleidoscopically as she dances the frames . She wears a yellow shift with enormous green and pink flowers on it . This is called a muu-muu , she tells me , the sexy ladies in Hawaii wear these . It is so hot there , she tells me , they go around without a top on . When I go there I will , too , says Becky Borichewsky . She grins to see that I am disgusted . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rivka to Becky , named her children Albert and Morton . She reads the Yiddish newspaper with Coke-bottle glasses and orders me to pour more salt . <p> Mrs. Fleischman , hah ! She claims she still keeps kosher . Did you put the salt ? Hop on it , hop on it ( Very American , the way she talks ) . Hop on it , Luchenkopf . Do n't call me that , Bubble . I know what it means . You are . Hole in the head . In one ear and back out . Off in space , these days . Put the salt . I hate to , Bubbie . It makes the meat bleed . How does it ? So I caught Mrs. Fleischman in the meat aisle at Fernando 's Superette . Handling a package of non-kosher chicken breasts like she already had the recipe . Do the salt crystals prick it , Bubble , do they bite it ? Just sprinkle , Miss Sensitive . Everything bleeds . I have to grind it for the meatball stew . You want meat with juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fleischman with her dirty chicken meat . You want kosher ? Then sprinkle . <p> Red-and-yellow box . Star of David outlined in black . KOSHER SALT . FOR ALL YOUR COOKING NEEDS . Bleed needs . Bite needs . The starry crystals live in soggy cardboard which has been handled , rehandled . Her plump fingers , swollen around the wedding band so . thin it is almost obscured by flesh , wrap around my hand . We shake the box . Crystal hail bounces . Her hand stinging over mine , we smack tandem on meat like stiff jelly . I want to push my elbow into the square middle of her and make her stop . Make us stop . <p> Finished . You see ? Not so hard . Shaking salt should be the hardest thing you ever have to do . <p> My hands grate together over salty grit like soap powder in public lavatories . The white bar of kosher soap smells detergent , wears a cod . ed mark in royal blue . No one knows the meaning of the mark , but without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the red plastic Eisenberg Monuments dish in back of her drainboard . <p> The cold water faucet leaks so slightly it seems to weep city water . Soap slithers through my hand , rim-rounds the dish . I rinse , hands cleaned , and hope I will not have to dirty them again today . <p> Hey , Mortie , have you heard the one about the two old friends ? ( says my father ) . <p> His voice sneaks in at me from my grandmother 's living room . Something is wrong in his voice the way he says , Hey , Mortie . Something small , dark , scurrying ... Have you heard the one ? ... deep at night . <p> What is this , Al , a joke ? My brother the stiff is telling a joke ? Call the New York Times , if you please . My brother the stuffed shirt has become a comedian . Get this man an agent . <p> Uncle Mortie . Making fun Mortie . What a guy , say ladies with lips dark as greased apple skin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , rocks himself back and forth . He stands too close for too long and laughs . Anything 's a joke : the ridiculous , the precious , the ugly , the secret that is the obvious . Cut it out , Mottle . Enough 's enough . Aw , A1 , do n't be such a ... Aw , Momma , do n't take it so ... Aw , Ellen , such a sweet girl , such a sweet . The older the little cousins get , the more jokes he pushes out at us . His mother , my grandmother , smacks him now and then on the bottom . Smartly and without conviction . A love tap . Disapproval with a smile . Mortie can get away with it . He does n't mean it . Really mean it . <p> Take a pinch from your old Uncle Mortie . Do you know what the old man did to ... Ellen , give your old Uncle Mortie a hug . Come on now , a great big tight hug for your old Uncle . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the old man ... And I ca n't hug you , Uncle Mortie . Not today . Not today . <p> Sure it 's a joke . You do n't have the corner on the joke market . So , one old friend , Stanley , meets another old friend , Louie . Hey , Louie , he says . ( says my father ) <p> Not my father . Jokes like this do not live inside my father . My father with his blue-veined hands that whisper across my forehead . With fingers that sweep so lightly they are hardly there at all . You got a fever , Kitten ? I 'll call the doctor . If only your mother were here with us . I hardly know what to do by myself . Let me put a cool towel on this head of yours . It 's better now , yes ? He touches me with a distance I can fall into and feel safe . His hands tuck blankets , tie ice skates , button coats against the cold . Have fun , go have fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair through over late night number lists . " Books " not like library books . Others ' books . His books . Worry books . The desk lamp lit in the darkened room is on all night . Are you OK , Daddy ? It 's nothing , yes . Nothing to worry . Get to bed , now . <p> Not my father . He is not a man with jokes to tell , with laughs to shake him at me , to cross the safe distance . <p> He shows me a smile , sometimes . A thin , going-away smile about a number table I can recite , about a story I tell . Bobby Berger says I 'm the smartest girl in the ... Mmhmm , nice , now I have to work , Kitten . Numbers in his head marching columns off the page . Red ink on green , double-vision lines , cross lines . Ground up , spit out into other columns . Stinging in his head like a plague of ants . Too consuming for a laugh . These figures are disembodied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe treasures . <p> Hey , Louie , do you like a woman with a big , fat butt ? Stanley says . No , says Lottie. ( says my father ) <p> My father whispers . This is his joke . These are his words . His . <p> My grandmother clamps the steel meat grinder onto the formica counter opposite the leaking drainboard . Formica , white with wheeling triangle shapes , red and blue that spill and glide into the metal casing which contains them at the edge . The very latest in formica design , the salesman must have said when he sold it to Becky a.k.a . Rivka . The salesman knew his customer . He convinced her on the strength of these words alone : Very Latest . <p> She hunks the meat . Stuffs two moist cubes into the gaping funnel top of the grinder . Rump roast , loin cuts . In the non-kosher meat aisle at Fernando 's Superette , I gaze at the meat chart , mysterious as the constellations . I contemplate chicken with cheese sauce , ham roast with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dotted lines with my kosher finger . Tracing the parts with my salt-wrinkled hands , bled of juice . <p> So , are you grinding yet ? Any time this century will be fine . I have potatoes to peel . Do you think the potatoes take their skins off and jump into the pot by themselves ? Press the stopper down on top . Hard , when you press . Hard , when you turn the handle . It 's a simple job , Miss . Grinding for stew should be the hardest thing you ever have to do . <p> Hey , Louie , do you like a woman with big , fat thighs , then ? No , says Louie. ( says my father ) <p> The grinder resists me . I wrestle to turn it . It makes a stickiness under my arms . I have a smell that was n't mine before . I am big , soft , round that was flat , hard , smooth a year ago . They make secret jokes about these changes in me . Talk what they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... It 's a long joke . A story from forever about how I am now . Am going to be always . Bodies do n't go back . <p> Spinning out from the nozzle , tight , thick worms curl and twist into the clear glass bowl for meatball making . Can I stop . now , Bubbie ? <p> Bubbie has a treat for you . Yes , stop . <p> They 're still telling it . He talks . He listens . They are both interested . <p> She grasps the heavy rye , saws a slice for me . Spreads the rye wide with kosher butter . For you , Miss , the way you like it . Spread with butter thick like frosting . When she puts the salt on , it bounces and stops , held by pale grease , slick and slightly sweet . In my mouth , the salt pricks , smooth grease beneath it , spread over sourdough with tiniest pungent seed bits of caraway textured in dough . <p> I bite through layers . I am six- , four- , two-years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another slice . Can I have the sailboat glass that turns the milk light blue inside ? Painted boats ride on whiteblue milk sea . Fernando 's gives a glass a week . Wash your hands before you drink the milk . There might be blood juice , the milk can not touch . <p> Separations are necessary . Man and woman . Dairy and meat . Child and adult . <p> In the case of such separations , I am neither and both . I am a trace on a dotted line . Waiting to understand the chart . <p> The rye bread is good , Bubbie . Eat , do n't talk , eat . You need your strength . You 're growing all over . Oh , Bubbie , I 'm not . Yes , grow . It 's good . Growing is your job now . Growing , and making kosher . Who else is going to teach you with no woman in the house ? Does your father know the recipe ? Would he eat if I did n't feed him ? He needs looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Listen , Bubbie . In your living room . He knows . He knows more . <p> So , Louie , do you like a woman with big , saggy breasts ? ( laughter on " breasts " ) No , says Louie. ( says my father ) <p> The rye bread is a lump deep below my throat . It sticks as a sharpness between two rounds of flesh that are my ... he said , " breasts . " BREASTS . The bread will push itself up and fly out of my mouth before I can wash the lump down with milk . My father has whispered it . <p> Women should whisper it . Men should not think it . That is why the women handle chicken breasts in clear packages , cook them in bits that can not be recognized . They make stews , salads , casseroles . Roundnesses will not be eaten as roundnesses by the men who ... will this story go on and on ? <p> What 's the matter , Miss Delicate ? You are waiting for the Messiah maybe ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make you another piece when the stew is in . Carrots . And peas . Yes , peas , even though you do n't like them . No little girl I ever knew liked peas . I thought you said I 'm not a little girl . You 're not grown yet . You 'll like them soon enough . I have been given a life sentence of liking peas and making meat into shapes a family can eat . Safely . <p> Even the father . Even with what he knows . <p> He leans close in with his hands resting on his thighs : he tells Mortie jokes as dirty as non-kosher chickens . ( Are you OK , Daddy ? I asked him lonely nights . He , a quiet mystery , was fine , knew more , wanted only to be left alone . Late night secrets . Standing behind him , hands folded . Heartbleed for him to notice . He ... Go to bed now , Kitten ... was done with me . Waiting . ) <p> Mortie will be sure to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock himself ... " these two old friends " ... Shake himself at me . " Do you like a woman ... ? " <p> Daddy ... I hear him coming to it ... do n't pronounce the final line . <p> So if you do n't like this kind of a woman , Louie , then why is it you 're sleeping with my wife ? ( says my father , laughs my uncle ) <p> Cover me , Bubble . Hurry . Ah , do n't listen to them . They do n't mean it . Sleeping with my wife . My father whispers in another man 's ear . I heard it , too . In a woman 's ear . It 's not for you , Miss . Do n't listen . <p> Hunks of meat in my hands . Of my hands . Kosher , bloodless redinside meat . <p> I appear . Head , shoulders , breasts , flank , loin , rump . I stand before him . <p> Kitten , oh , Kitten . It 's just a ... do n't take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> Chunks I throw leave stains in veins of red on walls and floor . Even kosher salt ca n't squeeze out all the blood . <p> I hate you , Daddy . I hate him , Bubbie . <p> Miss Sensitive , do n't take it so . <p> She swats him . Breeze light . Swats Mortie . What did I do ? You listened . Aw , Momma . They three wag and twist . <p> Ellen ! She ( as I run ) catches my arm . Clean it up . <p> I wo n't ! <p> I 'm your Bubbie . He 's your father . Cleaning up should be the hardest thing you ever have to do . <p> I will always hate you . I will always hate you both . <p> No , Miss , not always . <p> Forty years , a dozen candles . For the hands that kashered meat , fed me , excused him . <p> Forty years , one candle for him now . Burns me clear . <p> Everything bleeds . Bruises . Heals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
