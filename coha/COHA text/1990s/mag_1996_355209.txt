Given a scene in which an assassin stalks a potential victim , most readers will , in the absence of other evidence , instinctively root for the quarry . In the opening pages of his new novel , The Statement ( Dutton ; 250 pages ; $22.95 ) , Brian Moore provides just such a scene : in a village in the south of France an old man is being tailed by a hired killer . The murder , the assassin decides , will take place when his target drives back to the monastery where he has been staying . Feigning engine trouble along the route , he waits for the old man to stop , then approaches as if to ask for a lift , pulls out a pistol and is fatally shot twice in the chest by the man he planned to kill . <P> This sort of narrative turnaround usually provides the pleasure of surprise , the sense that poetic justice has foiled a malevolent act . Moore quickly cuts off such easy certainties . He shows the old man examining the possessions of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended victim as " Pierre Brossard , former Chief of the Second Section of the Marseilles region of the Milice , condemned to death in absentia by French courts , in 1944 and again in 1946 . " The statement goes on to say that Brossard was charged with the massacre of 14 Jews on June 15 , 1945 . The document , which the old man realizes was to be pinned on his body , concludes , " The case is closed . " <P> Not true , of course , because the old man  --  who is indeed Brossard , although he has called himself Pouliot for many years  --  survives . But who , in 1989 , still wants to punish him for his past by killing him ? Brossard assumes that Jewish money is behind this attempt on his life . That belief , a measure of his reflexive anti-Semitism , will have fatal consequences . <P> The Statement may have a classic thriller 's plot  --  a character on the run , private power plays behind public facades  --  but it unfolds in a moral universe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the black hats so typical of the genre . The novel asks not only who is trying to murder Brossard but also why Brossard has been able to remain in France for 44 years , receiving asylum from various Roman Catholic monasteries , and a 1971 presidential pardon for the crimes he committed during the German occupation and the Vichy regime . <P> " It is hard to pass judgment on what people did back then , " says a French army colonel who is also looking to bring Brossard to justice . This remark is the crux of the novel . Does a time come when people must be forgiven for doing what they mistakenly believed was right or unavoidable ? Or should evil never be forgiven or forgotten ? By challenging the reader to confront these questions , The Statement is ultimately unforgettable . <P>  --  By Paul Gray
