<p> CHICAGO - A United Airlines flight attendant lies unconscious in the rear galley of the Boeing 727 . If it 's a heart attack , she 'll be dead in 10 minutes unless fellow crew member Charlie Pender can save her . <p> Pender reaches into the plane 's ' grab-and-go ' bag and takes out a device that will analyze the problem and , if needed , zap the heart back to life . He presses the defibrillator 's green ' on ' button . <p> The machine 's mechanical voice calls out instructions : ' Apply pads to the patient 's bare chest . Plug in pads ' connector next to flashing light . ' <p> The device analyzes the heart rhythm . <p> ' Shock advised , ' it says . ' Stay clear of patient . ' <p> Pender presses the orange ' shock ' button . <p> The machine considers the results . They 're good . ' It is safe to touch the patient . Check airway , check breathing , check pulse . If needed , begin CPR . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nabors , have made the ' save . ' <p> But the rescue occurred not on a plane but in a hotel room near O'Hare Airport , and the crew member actually was a mannequin named Annie . <p> They and another dozen United flight attendants are learning how to use defibrillators as part of United 's emergency medical training program . The airline has begun equipping all of its nearly 600 airplanes with the automated , compact devices , and over the next 21/2 years , all of its 25,000 flight attendants will be trained . <p> Sudden cardiac arrest is a leading cause of death in the United States , striking approximately 250,000 people a year . Up to now , only about 5 percent of the victims have survived . <p> Yet widespread use of defibrillators could raise the survival rate to 30 percent or more , according to cardiac experts . <p> The most common form of cardiac arrest is ventricular fibrillation - a chaotic heart rhythm that can occur without warning . It causes the heart to quiver and not pump blood through its chambers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the attack , the victim 's chances of survival fall 10 percent . <p> Defibrillators administer a jolt of electricity to the chest of a heart-attack victim in an effort to restore normal heart rhythms . <p> In the past , there was no way to save a victim of heart fibrillation on an airplane , but advances in technology have made defibrillators portable and useable by trained crew members . <p> ' Early defibrillation by trained , nontraditional rescuers represents the most exciting development in resuscitation since the CPR movement began in 1960 , ' said Mary Fran Hazinski , a registered nurse and senior science editor for emergency cardiovascular care programs at the American Heart Association . <p> ' This will save lives , ' adds Thomas Frohlich , chief of cardiology at Evanston Hospital , near Chicago . ' I have no doubt about that . ' <p> MedAire Inc. , a Phoenix-based company that trains airplane crew members in defibrillator use and supplies airlines with medical advice from physicians on the ground , has studied in-flight medical emergencies . <p> Of 15 passengers who died betwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MedAire serves , 12 were cardiac-related , the company said . In none of those cases were defibrillators available . <p> Other studies show that cardiac problems are the most common cause of inflight medical emergencies , and result in 70 deaths in the air worldwide every year . <p> Flight attendants are trained extensively to deal with emergencies - cabin depressurizations , emergency landing , evacuations . <p> But a sudden cardiac arrest of a passenger or fellow crew member at 37,000 feet can make ' your palms sweat and your brain turn to oatmeal , ' Diane Briney , a registered nurse and CPR instructor , tells the class that includes Pender , Rhea and Nabors . <p> So United 's all-day course is designed so the flight attendants react instinctively and efficiently . The course includes training in CPR and assisting both conscious and unconscious patients who are choking , as well as use of the defibrillator . <p> Briney , who works for MedAire , calls CPR the ' bridge ' to using the defibrillator . CPR temporarily supplies the brain , heart and lungs with blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself , CPR will not get a patient out of ventricular fibrillation , she adds . <p> The defibrillator used by United is a compact , 4-pound model called the Heartstream ForeRunner , made by Agilent Technologies , a company that recently spun off from Hewlett-Packard . <p> ' Use the defibrillator only when the patient is unconscious , not breathing and with no pulse , ' Briney says , adding that flight attendants ca n't accidently shock someone who does n't need defibrillation . <p> The machine will read the victim 's heart rhythm and only call for a shock if he or she is in ventricular fibrillation , Briney says . Unavoidably , defibrillation will invade the privacy of the patient , she adds . <p> The pads which administer the electric shock must be placed on bare skin . Their placement follows the electrical pathway of the heart . <p> One pad is placed on the upper right side of chest , under the collar bone . The second is placed under the left breast on the side of the body . <p> Included in the defibrillator kit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her fellow flight attendant , one class member suggests that a ' wire cutter ' might be needed to remove some of the bras that women wear these days . <p> Briney smiles , and then , lest potential women patients feel all the discomfort , holds up another tool from the kit for use on men with thick chest hair - a razor . <p> While Pender , Rhea and Nabors practice on their Annie , flight attendants Loretta Sommers , Chris Kendall and Cathy Dikos work on a second mannequin . Briney gives them the scenario : ' A passenger is found on the floor of the first-class cabin , lying on his back , not moving and appears to be unconscious . ' <p> Each flight attendant takes a turn leading the rescue . <p> Hunched over the ' victim , ' Sommers , a 10-year veteran at United , follows a checklist . <p> She calls for the grab-and-go bag , tells Kendall to notify the cockpit and lead flight attendant and directs Dikos to get on the public address system and ask if a medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Passengers also are told to turn off all personal electronic devices in the cabin , so they do n't interfere with the defibrillator . When the device arrives , Sommers applies the pads , and following the prompts , delivers the first shock . <p> The machine analyzes the heart rhythm and calls for another shock . Then another . Finally , it calls for a fourth shock . <p> ' Analyzing heart rhythm . No shock advised , ' the machine says . <p> Normally , cardiac rescuers might take only five seconds to feel for a pulse . But as Briney explains to her students , ' You 're in a noisy , vibrating aluminum tube . Take 10 seconds to try to find pulse . ' <p> This time , the flight attendants are told ' the patient is not breathing , but has a pulse . ' <p> Sommers shifts to ' rescue breathing ' - giving the patient one breath every five seconds . <p> Briney acknowledges that cardiac rescue procedures take a toll on practitioners . They should continue to deliver care until breathing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first responder is too exhausted to continue ' or another trained responder arrives and takes over , ' she says . <p> During a break in the all-day class , Gayle Rhea says United 's installation of defibrillators is an emotional issue for her . <p> ' My dad died unexpectedly of a heart attack last year , ' she said . ' When I heard that there was to be this training , I said I want to be one of the first to get it . '
