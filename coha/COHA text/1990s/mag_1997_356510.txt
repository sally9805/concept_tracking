Heaven has many cartographers , and through the centuries many different heavens have been charted . To the variety of celestial landscapes in the West , Islam and Buddhism have raised their own particular paradises : the Koran details a heaven filled with beautiful , large-eyed " companions " and youths of perpetual freshness ; the sutras speak of a multiplicity of " Buddha fields , " pleasant way stations on the journey to Nirvana . Adding to the plenitude , the New Age is now unrolling its own versions of eternity . The best-selling author , internationally renowned medium and healer Rosemary Altea , for example , speaks of her vision : " Heaven is not a place ; it 's a state of awareness . Heaven is where your heart is , where your soul needs to be . " Yet every paradise partakes of the same spiritual journey , and even Altea 's shares attributes outlined in one of Islam 's most venerable divine proclamations : " My heaven and my earth do not comprise me , but the heart of my faithful servant comprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Judaism and Christianity , including the hierarchy of angels and the seven tiers of paradise . But Muslims have a specific plan of paradise in mind , based on the stories of the Prophet 's miraculous night journey to heaven . Rising into the skies on the Buraq , a fantastic creature often described as part woman , part horse , part peacock , Muhammad meets Adam , who resides in the lowest heaven , and Jesus , who is only in the fourth level . Abraham welcomes him in the seventh heaven before the Prophet is ushered into paradise for his encounter with God . It was in heaven , according to one traditional tale , that Muhammad , on Moses ' advice , bargained down God 's original demand of 50 prayers a day to five , the number of times a day each devout Muslim must face Mecca . <P> Buddhism has as many paradises as there are Buddhas . Each enlightened being has his or her own heaven , a concept probably borrowed from Hinduism , in which gods and goddesses inhabit a series of heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one called Sukhavati , which may itself have borrowed some elements from the florid paradises of Zoroastrian Persia ( whence the word pairi-daeza , or enclosure , the origin of our word paradise ) . As Sakyamuni , the Buddha of our cosmos , teaches , if the denizens of Sukhavati " desire cloaks of different colors and many hundred thousand colors , then with these very best cloaks the whole Buddha country shines . " Presided over by the Amitabha Buddha , Sukhavati , according to the ancient texts , had no ghosts , no beasts , no sickness  --  and no women . Yet those who reach the Pure Land , as East Asian Buddhists call it , know the journey of their souls is not over . Wrote a 6th century Chinese master : " Although they dwell in seven jeweled palaces , and have fine objects , smells , tastes and sensations , yet they do not regard this as pleasure ... and seek only to leave that place . " Nirvana , the ultimately selfless Buddhist goal of nonbeing , is beyond paradise . Annemarie Schimmel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
