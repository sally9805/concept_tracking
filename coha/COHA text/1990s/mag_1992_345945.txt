There was n't much suspense in the Visual Effects category at last week 's Oscars . The nominees were Hook , for its twinkly , shrinkly Tinkerbell ( created by a team at producer George Lucas ' Industrial Light &; Magic shop ) , Backdraft , for its nifty fire rampage ( Industrial Light &; Magic ) and Terminator 2 : Judgment Day , in part for its liquid-metal cyborg that can " morph "  --  change seamlessly , seductively  --  into any shape ( Industrial Light &; Magic ) . And the Oscar went to . . . Industrial Light &; Magic , for T2 . <P> Dennis Muren , senior visual-effects supervisor at ILM , has become a familiar figure on Oscar night , both because this was his seventh Academy Award and because he is a towering gent with lank white hair and a serene face . That picture  --  of a modern Merlin holding a gold totem  --  is appropriate , for Muren , 45 , is a wizard in the movie craft of computer graphics . In the bland ILM barracks in San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little wand over their Silicon Graphics VGX 340 terminals , and out comes the magic . <P> As traditional special-effects experts , Muren and his ILM-makers brought to life some of the most famous icons in movie history , from Darth Vader to E.T . Now he is leading a revolution in moviemaking . ILM has tamed the elements : fire and water are notoriously tough to animate , but the company managed the first convincingly in Backdraft and the second with the slinky pseudopod in The Abyss . An ILM team led by Steve Williams animated  --  brought to life , if you will  --  the T-1000 creature in T2 , which could transform itself from , say , linoleum into a lethal humanoid weapon . " Movie effects have been the same for a hundred years , and they 're changing this year , " Williams , 30 , says with a visionary 's lack of modesty . " This is the milestone right here . " <P> Computer graphics as movie art form  --  a technical advance that leapfrogs over the wondrous and cumbersome stop-motion puppeteering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just a decade old . The Disney film TRON , which took place inside a video game , was the first to explore the new technique . In the Steven Spielberg-produced Young Sherlock Holmes ( 1985 ) , a computer-generated knight wielding a sword leaped out of a stained-glass window and menaced a priest . Morphing , the big news in special effects , made its debut in Willow ( 1988 ) : a reclining tiger is smoothly transformed into a sleeping woman . <P> These days , morphing is everywhere . The swamis at Pacific Data Images  --  one of the half a dozen California studios competing with ILM  --  devised the melting pot of faces for Michael Jackson 's Black or White . Pacific has also changed a car into a running tiger for Exxon and morphed a man 's face into a block for Schick razors . The process can be used to fuse separate takes of a scene or restore damaged film frames . <P> " Computer graphics , " says ILM animator Mark Dippe , " has become an essential design and communication tool . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hospitals use realistic three-dimensional computer animation to walk doctors through their next operation before they ever pick up a scalpel . The FBI can simulate what a missing child would look like years after a disappearance .
