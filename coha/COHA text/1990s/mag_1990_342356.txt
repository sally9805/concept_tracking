The sack , as suit , is fading fast , just as the sack , as fate , is becoming more common . All the brooding talk of recession and employment cutbacks has hit the men 's fashion industry where it has hit the economy : right in the middle . The staple of the business  --  the standard two- or three-piece suit that fits around the average frame as trimly as a swath of burlap around 50 lbs . of Pillsbury  --  has lost its allure : too drab , too ordinary and , in an approaching crunch , too superfluous . What 's already in the closet is good enough for now , and if it 's not  --  if a man has the cash and a need for flash  --  he 's reaching way upscale , to Armani and Ralph Lauren and the heady heights of bespoke tailoring . The Europhile tailored look that belonged to the hard- eyed Gordon Gekkos of this world is moving into the mainstream . <P> This leaves the time-honored bastion of sartorial conservatism  --  the merchants of the midrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh idea . The trend is against them and so , for the moment , are the numbers . Hartmarx Corp. , which owns middle-income retail stores like Wallachs in New York and Baskin in Chicago as well as Hart Schaffner &; Marx , purveyors of off-the-peg businessman style for more than 100 years , has been enduring a three-year slump even though it retains an 11% share of the U.S. men 's suit market . Brooks Brothers posted a 41% drop in operating profits for the past fiscal year . A spokesman for Marks &; Spencer , the British department-store outfit that now owns Brooks , blamed " difficult trading conditions and severe price cutting by department stores . " <P> That may be , but Brooks has of late tried to get with the new fashion program , which is a little like watching your Great-Uncle Roger show up for a guest shot on Yo ! MTV Raps . The standard-issue Brooks Ivy League sack has been supplemented with svelter models priced from $395 to $695 that offer a little trim of the trousers and some tuck at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less Organization Man . It was Ralph Lauren who modified and merchandised the Brooks Brahmin look into his own house style , which might be called Long Island Anglo : jackets more suppressed in the waist and side vented , trousers as often buoyed by suspenders as not . <P> Now the Brit look , or variations on it , is everywhere , along with the softer , more soigne tailoring of the French and Italian variety . One recent Wallachs ad trumpeted the virtues of a Christian Dior suit ( at $550 ) , a store staple for years even though Wallachs ' buyers managed to turn Dior 's Gallic glitz into a kind of standard broker bland . <P> While they have been drifting away from their former shape , men have also been toying with new colors . The serviceable old grays and blues still predominate , but " you see more and more taupes on the commuter trains in Chicago , " reports Kenneth Hoffman , chief executive of Hart Schaffner &; Marx . " Now you can have an olive suit in six different shades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
