On the last morning of Virginia 's bloodiest year since the Civil War , I built a fire and sat facing a window of darkness where at sunrise I knew I would find the sea . I was in my robe in lamplight , reviewing my office 's annual statistics for car crashes , hangings , beatings , shootings , stabbings , when the telephone rudely rang at five-fifteen . " Damn , " I muttered , for I was beginning to feel less charitable about answering Dr. Philip Mant 's phone . " All right , all right . " His weathered cottage was tucked behind a dune in a stark coastal Virginia subdivision called Sandbridge , between the U.S. Naval Amphibious Base and Back Bay National Wildlife Refuge . Mant was my deputy chief medical examiner for the Tidewater District , and sadly , his mother had died last week on Christmas Eve . Under ordinary circumstances , his returning to London to get family affairs in order would not have constituted an emergency for the Virginia medical examiner system . But his assistant forensic pathologist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morgue supervisor had quit . " Mant residence , " I answered as wind tore the dark shapes of pines beyond windowpanes . " This is Officer Young with the Chesapeake police , " said someone who sounded like a white male born and bred in the South . " I 'm trying to reach Dr. Mant . " " He is out of the country , " I answered . " How may I help you ? " " Are you Mrs. Mant ? " " I 'm Dr. Kay Scarpetta , the chief medical examiner . I 'm covering for Dr. Mant . " The voice hesitated , and went on , " We got a tip about a death . An anonymous call . " " Do you know where this death supposedly took place ? " I was making notes . " Supposedly the Inactive Naval Ship Yard . " " Excuse me ? " I looked up . He repeated what he had said . " What are we talking about , a Navy SEAL ? " I was baffled , for it was my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around old ships moored at the Inactive Yard . " We do n't know who it is but he might have been looking for Civil War relics . " " After dark ? " " Ma'am , the area 's off-limits unless you have clearance . But that has n't stopped people from being curious before . They sneak their boats in and always it 's after dark . " " This scenario is what the anonymous caller suggested ? " " Pretty much . " " That 's rather interesting . " " I thought so . " " And the body has n't been located yet , " I said as I continued to wonder why this officer had taken it upon himself to call a medical examiner at such an early hour when it was not known for a fact that there was a body or even someone missing . " We 're out looking now , and the Navy 's sending in a few divers , so we 'll get the situation handled if it pans out . But I just wanted you to have a heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condolences . " " Your condolences ? " I puzzled , for if he had known about Mant 's circumstances , why did he call here asking for him ? " I heard his mother passed on . " I rested the tip of the pen on the sheet of paper . " Would you tell me your full name and how you can be reached , please ? " " S. T. Young . " He gave me a telephone number and we hung up . I stared into the low fire , feeling uneasy and lonely as I got up to add more wood . I wished I were in Richmond in my own home with its candles in the windows and Fraser fir decorated with Christmases from my past . I wanted Mozart and Handel instead of wind shrilly rushing around the roof , and wished I had not taken Mant up on his kind offer that I could stay in his home instead of a hotel . I resumed reading the statistical report , but my mind would not stop drifting . I imagined the sluggish water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be less than sixty degrees , visibility , at best , maybe eighteen inches . In the winter , it was one thing to dive for oysters in the Chesapeake Bay or go thirty miles offshore in the Atlantic Ocean to explore a sunken aircraft carrier or German submarine and other wonders worth a wet suit . But in the Elizabeth River , where the Navy parked its decommissioned ships , I could think of nothing enticing , no matter the weather . I could not imagine who would dive there alone in winter after dark to look for artifacts or anything , and believed the tip would prove to be a crank . Leaving the recliner chair , I walked into the master bedroom where my belongings had metastasized throughout most of the small , chilly space . I undressed quickly and took a hurried shower , having discovered my first day here that the hot-water heater had its limitations . In fact , I did not like Dr. Mant 's drafty house with its knotty pine paneling the color of amber and dark brown painted floors that showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in the dark clutches of gusting wind , and every moment in his minimally furnished home was cold and unsettled by shifting sounds that sometimes caused me to sit up in my sleep and reach for my gun . Swathed in a robe with a towel wrapped around my hair , I checked the guest bedroom and bath to make certain all was in order for the midday arrival of Lucy , my niece . Then I surveyed the kitchen , which was pitiful compared to the one I had at home . I did not seem to have forgotten anything yesterday when I had driven to Virginia Beach to shop , although I would have to do without garlic press , pasta maker , food processor and microwave oven . I was seriously beginning to wonder if Mant ever ate in or even stayed here . At least I had thought to bring my own cutlery and cookware , and as long as I had good knives and pots there was n't much I could n't manage . I read some more and fell asleep in the glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I grabbed the receiver as my eyes adjusted to sunlight in my face . " This is Detective C. T. Roche with Chesapeake , " said another male voice I did not know . " I understand you 're coveting for Dr. Mant , and we need an answer from you real quick . Looks like we got a diving fatality in the Inactive Naval Ship Yard , and we need to go ahead and recover the body . " " I 'm assuming this is the case one of your officers called me about earlier ? " His long pause was followed by the rather defensive remark , " As far as I know , I 'm the first one notifying you . " " An officer named Young called me at quarter past five this morning . Let me see . " I checked the call sheet . " Initials S as in Sam , T as in Tom . " Another pause , then he said in the same tone , " Well , I got no idea who you 're talking about since we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I took notes . The time was thirteen minutes past nine o'clock . I was baffled by what he had just said . If the first caller really was n't police , then who was he , why had he called , and how did he know Mant ? " When was the body found ? " I asked Roche . " Around six a security guard for the shipyard noticed a johnboat anchored behind one of the ships . There was a long hose in the water , like maybe there was someone diving at the other end . And when it had n't budged an hour later , we were called . One diver was sent down and like I said , there is a body . " " Do we have an identification ? " " We recovered a wallet from the boat . The driver 's license is that of a white male named Theodore Andrew Eddings . " " The reporter ? " I said in disbelief . " That Ted Eddings ? " " Thirty-two years old , brown hair , blue eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of West Grace Street . " The Ted Eddings I knew was an award-winning investigative reporter for the Associated Press . Scarcely a week went by when he did n't call me about something . For a moment , I almost ' could n't think . " We also recovered a nine-millimeter pistol from the boat , " he said . When I spoke again , it was very firmly . " His identification absolutely is not to be released to the press or anyone else until it has been confirmed . " " I already told everybody that . Not to worry . " " Good . And no one has any idea why this individual might have been diving in the Inactive Ship Yard ? " I asked . " He might have been looking for Civil War stuff . " " You speculate that based on what ? " " A lot of people like to look in the rivers around here for cannonballs and things , " he said . " Okay . So we 'll go on and pull him in so he 's not down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want him touched , and leaving him in the water a little longer is n't going to change anything . " " What is it you 're gon na do ? " He sounded defensive again . " I wo n't know until I get there . " " Well , I do n't think it 's necessary for you to come here ... " " Detective Roche , " I interrupted him . " The necessity of my coming to the scene and what I do when I 'm there is not for you to decide . " " Well , there 's all these people I 've got on hold , and this afternoon it 's suppose to snow . Nobody wants to be standing around out there on the piers . " " According to the Code of Virginia , the body is my jurisdiction , not yours or any other police , fire , rescue or funeral person 's . Nobody touches the body until I say so . " I spoke with just enough edge to let him know I could be sharp . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell all the rescue and shipyard people to just hang out , and they are n't going to be happy . The Navy 's already leaning on me pretty hard to clear the area before the media shows up . " " This is not a Navy case . " " You tell them that . It 's their ships . " " I 'll be happy to tell them that . In the meantime , you just tell everyone that I 'm on my way , " I said to him before I hung up . Realizing it could be many hours before I returned to the cottage , I left a note taped to the front door that cryptically instructed Lucy how to let herself in should I not be here . I hid a key only she could find , then loaded medical bag and dive equipment into the trunk of my black Mercedes . At quarter of ten the temperature had risen to thirty-eight degrees , and my attempts to reach Captain Pete Marino in Richmond were frustrating . " Thank God , " I muttered when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Scarpetta . " " Yo . " " You 've got your pager on . I 'm shocked , " I said to him . " If you 're so shocked , then why the hell 'd you call it ? " He sounded pleased to hear from me . " What 's up ? " " You know that reporter you dislike so much ? " I was careful not to divulge details because we were on the air and could be monitored by scanners . " As in which one ? " " As in the one who works for AP and is always dropping by my office . " He thought a moment , then said , " So what 's the deal ? You have a run-in with him ? " " Unfortunately , I may be about to . I 'm on my way to the Elizabeth River . Chesapeake just called . " " Wait a minute . Not that kind of run-in . " His tone was ominous . " I 'm afraid so . " " Holy shit . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ca n't be certain , yet . I 'm going to go in and take a look before we move him . " " Now wait a damn minute , " he said . " Why the hell do you need to do something like that ? Ca n't other people take care of it ? " " I need to see him before he 's moved , " I repeated . Marino was very displeased because he was overly protective . He did n't have to say another word for me to know that . " I just thought you might want to check out his residence in Richmond , " I told him . " Yeah . I sure as hell will . " " I do n't know what we 're going to find . " " Well , I just wish you 'd let them find it first . " In Chesapeake , I took the Elizabeth River exit , then turned left on High Street , passing brick churches , used-car lots and mobile homes . Beyond the city jail and police headquarters , naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvage yard surrounded by a rusty fence topped with barbed wire . In the midst of acres littered with metal and overrun by weeds was a power plant that appeared to burn trash and coal to supply the shipyard with energy to run its dismal , inert business . Smokestacks and train tracks were quiet today , all dry-dock cranes out of work . It was , after all , New Year 's Eve . I drove on toward a headquarters built of boring tan cinderblock , beyond which were long paved piers . At the guard gate , a young man in civilian clothes and hard hat stepped out of his booth . I rolled my window down as clouds churned in the windswept sky . " This is a restricted area . " His face was completely devoid of expression . " I 'm Dr. Kay Scarpetta , the chief medical examiner , " I said as I displayed the brass shield that symbolized my jurisdiction over every sudden , unattended , unexplained or violent death in the Commonwealth of Virginia . Leaning closer , he studied my credentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at my car . " You 're the chief medical examiner ? " he asked . " So how come you 're not driving a hearse ? " I had heard this before and was patient when I replied , " People who work in funeral homes drive hearses . I do n't work in a funeral home . I am a medical examiner . " " I 'm going to need some other form of identification . " I gave him my driver 's license , and had no doubt that this sort of interference was n't going to improve once he allowed me to drive through . He stepped back from my car , lifting a portable radio to his lips . " Unit eleven to unit two . " He turned away from me as if about to tell secrets . " Two , " floated back the reply . " I got a Dr. Scaylatta here . " He mispronounced my name worse than most people did . " Ten-four . We 're standing by . " " Ma'am , " the security guard said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parking lot on your fight . " He pointed . " You need to leave your car there and walk to Pier Two , where you 'll find Captain Green . That 's who you need to see . " " And where will I find Detective Roche ? " I asked . " Captain Green 's who you need to see , " he repeated . I rolled my window up as he opened a gate posted with signs warning that I was about to enter an industrial area where spray painting was an imminent hazard , safety equipment was required and parking was at my own risk . In the distance , dull gray cargo and tank landing ships , and mine sweepers , frigates and hydrofoils in intimidated the cold horizon . On the second pier , emergency vehicles , police cars and a small group of men had gathered . Leaving my car as instructed , I briskly walked toward them as they stared . I had left my medical bag and dive gear in the car , so I was an empty-handed , middle-aged woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat . The instant I set foot on the pier , a distinguished , graying man in uniform intercepted me as if I were trespassing . Unsmiling , he stepped in my path . " May I help you ? " he asked in a tone that said halt , as the wind lifted his hair and colored his cheeks . I again explained who I was . " Oh , good . " He certainly did not sound as if he meant it . " I 'm Captain Green with Navy Investigative Service . We really do need to get on with this . Listen , " he turned away from me and spoke to someone else . " We got ta get those CPs off ... " " Excuse me . You 're with NIS ? " I cut in , for I was going to get this cleared up now . " It was my belief that this shipyard is not Navy property . If it is Navy property , I should n't be here . The case should be the Navy 's and autopsied by Navy pathologists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried his patience , " this shipyard is a civilian contractor-operated facility , and therefore not naval property . But we have an obvious interest because it appears someone was diving unauthorized around our vessels . " " Do you have a theory as to why someone might have done that ? " I looked around . " Some treasure hunters think they 're going to find cannonballs , old ship bells and whatnot in waters around here . " We were standing between the cargo ship El Paso and the submarine Exploiter , both of them lusterless and rigid in the river . The water looked like cappuccino , and I realized that visibility was going to be even worse than I had feared . Near the submarine , there was a dive platform . But I saw no sign of the victim or the rescuers and police supposedly working his death . I asked Green about this as wind blowing off the water numbed my face , and his reply was to give me his back again . " Look , I ca n't be here all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coveralls and a filthy ski jacket . " We could haul Bo 's butt in here , Cap'n , " was the reply . " No way Jos , " Green said , and he seemed quite familiar with these shipyard men . " No point in calling that boy . " " Hell , " said another man with a long tangled beard . " We all know he ai n't gon na be sober this late in the morning . " " Well , now if that is n't the pot calling the kettle black , " Green said , and all of them laughed . The bearded man had a complexion like raw hamburger . He slyly eyed me as he lit a cigarette , shielding it from the wind in rough bare hands . " I had n't had a drink since yesterday . Not even water , " he swore as his mates laughed some more . " Damn , it 's cold as a witch 's titty . " He hugged himself . " I should'a wore a better coat . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Another worker spoke , dentures clicking as he talked about what I realized was the dead diver . " Now that boy 's cold . " " He do n't feel it now . " I controlled my mounting irritation as I said to Green , " I know you 're eager to get started , and so am I. But I do n't see any rescuers or police . I have n't seen the johnboat or the area of the river where the body is located . " I felt half a dozen pairs of eyes on me , and I scanned the eroded faces of what easily could have been a small band of pirates dressed for modern times . I was not invited into their secret club and was reminded of those early years when rudeness and isolation could still make me cry . Green finally answered , " The police are inside using the phones . In the main building there , the one with the big anchor in front . The divers are probably in there too staying warm . The rescue squad is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they 've been waiting for you to get here . And you might be interested in knowing that this same landing is where the police just found a truck and trailer they believe belonged to the deceased . If you follow me . " He began walking . " I 'll show you the location you 're interested in . I understand you plan on going in with the other divers . " " That 's right . " I walked with him along the pier . " I sure as hell do n't know what you expect to see . " " I learned long ago to have no expectations , Captain Green . " As we passed old , tired ships , I noticed many fine metal lines leading from them into the water . " What are those ? " I asked . " CPscathodic protectors , " he answered . " They 're electrically charged to reduce corrosion . " " I certainly hope someone has turned them off . " " An electrician 's on the way . He 'll turn off the whole pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPs . I doubt it would have been easy to see them . " " It would n't matter . The charge is very mild , " he said as if anyone should know that . " It 's like getting zapped with a nine-volt battery . CPs did n't kill him . You can already mark that one off your list . " We had stopped at the end of the pier where the rear of the partially submerged submarine was in plain view . Anchored no more than twenty feet from it was the dark green aluminum johnboat with its long black hose leading from the compressor , which was nestled in an inner tube on the passenger 's side . The floor of the boat was scattered with tools , scuba equipment and other objects that I suspected had been rather carelessly gone through by someone . My chest tightened , for I was angrier than I would show . " He probably just drowned , " Green was saying . " Almost every diving death I 've seen was a drowning . You die in water as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . " " I certainly find his equipment unusual . " I ignored his medical pontifications . He stared at the johnboat barely stirred by the current . " A hookah . Yeah , it 's unusual for around here . " " Was it running when the boat was found ? " " Out of gas . " " What can you tell me about it ? Homemade ? " " Commercial , " he said . " A five-horsepower gasoline-driven compressor that draws in surface air through a low-pressure hose connected to a second-stage regulator . He could have stayed down four , five hours . As long as his fuel lasted . " He continued to stare off . " Four or five hours ? For what ? " I looked at him . " I can understand that if you 're collecting lobsters or abalone . " He was silent . " What is down there ? " I said . " And do n't tell me Civil War artifacts because we both know you 're not going to find those here . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , " I said , " he thought something was . " " Unfortunately for him , he thought wrong . Look at those clouds moving in . We 're definitely going to get it . " He flipped his coat collar up around his ears . " I assume you 're a certified diver . " " For many years . " " I 'm going to need to see your dive card . " I looked out at the johnboat and the submarine nearby as I wondered just how uncooperative these people intended to be . " You 've got to have that with you if you 're going in , " he said . " I thought you would have known that . " " And I thought the military did not run this shipyard . " " I know the rules here . It does n't matter who runs it . " He stared at me . " I see . " I stared back . " And I suppose I 'm going to need a permit if I want to park my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry my gear half a mile . " " You do need a permit to park on the pier . " " Well , I do n't have one of those . I do n't have my PADI advanced and rescue dive cards or my dive log . I do n't have my licenses to practice medicine in Virginia , Maryland or Florida . " I spoke very smoothly and quietly , and because he could not rattle me , he became more determined . He blinked several times , and I could feel his hate . " This is the last time I 'm going to ask you to allow me to do my job , " I went on . " We have an unnatural death here that is in my jurisdiction . If you would rather not cooperate , I will be happy to call the state police , the U.S. Marshal , FBI . Your choice . I can probably get somebody here in twenty minutes . I 've got my portable phone right here in my pocket . " I patted it . " You want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you 'll have to sign a waiver relieving the shipyard of any responsibility , should something unfortunate happen . And I seriously doubt there are any forms like that here . " " I see . Now I need to sign something you do n't have . " " That 's correct . " " Fine , " I said . " Then I 'll just draft a waiver for you . " " A lawyer would have to do that , and it 's a holiday . " " I am a lawyer and I work on holidays . " His jaw muscles knotted , and I knew he was n't going to bother with any forms now that it was possible to have one . We started walking back , and my stomach tightened with dread . I did not want to make this dive and I did not like the people I had encountered this day . Certainly , I had gotten entangled in bureaucratic barbed wire before when cases involved government or big business . But this was different . " Tell me something , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do chief medical examiners always personally go in after bodies ? " " Rarely . " " Explain why you think it is necessary this time . " " The scene of death will be gone the moment the body is moved . I think the circumstances are unusual enough to merit my taking a look while I can . And I 'm temporarily covering my Tidewater District , so I happened to be here when the call came in . " He paused , then unnerved me by saying , " I certainly was sorry to hear about Dr. Mant 's mother . When will he be back to work ? " I tried to remember this morning 's phone call and the man called Young with his exaggerated Southern accent . Green did not sound native to the South , but then neither did I , and that did n't mean either of us could n't imitate a drawl . " I 'm not certain when he 'll return , " I warily replied . " But I 'm wondering how you know him . " " Sometimes cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure what he was implying . " Dr. Mant understands the importance of not interfering , " Green went on . " People like that are good to work with . " " The importance of not interfering with what , Captain Green ? " " If a case is the Navy 's , for example , or this jurisdiction or that . There are many different ways that people can interfere . All are a problem and can be harmful . That diver , for example . He went where he did n't belong and look what happened . " I had stopped walking and was staring at him in disbelief . " It must be my imagination , " I said , " but I think you 're threatening me . " " Go get your gear . You can park closer in , by the fence over there , " he said , walking off .
