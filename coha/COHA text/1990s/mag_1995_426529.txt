More Harm Than Good ? <p> There is perhaps no issue in medicine that appears to have been so definitively answered as has the need for preventive medicine . After all , the money and life-saving potential of preventive care is as old as the hills . Nearly everyone grew up learning cliches such as " a stitch in time saves nine " and " an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure . " <p> Currently , medical professionals advise that Americans undergo an entire battery of preventive screening tests and exams . The American Medical Association , for example , recommends physicals every one to five years for people between ages 30 and 50 , and every one to two years thereafter . Regular cholesterol tests are encouraged . Colon exams should be conducted every year for people over age 30 . Screening tests for cervical cancer are recommended every one-to-three years for women over age 30 . <p> All this testing , of course , is designed to catch health problems early , before they have a chance to manifest themselves as harmful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the medical and insurance industries , are not only reduced cost , but prolonged life . <p> An entire industry has grown up around the goal of prevention . Managed care companies often refer to themselves as " wellness " plans . By keeping enrollees well  --  through preventive screening tests , nutrition counseling , and the like  --  these companies say they can save money by preventing the need for costly treatments . <p> In the debate over health care reform last year , much was said about the need to offer every American health insurance that provided generous coverage for preventive care . The savings from preventing diseases could easily pay for the expanded coverage , or so the argument went . President Clinton claimed that " any family doctor will tell you that people will stay healthier and long-term costs of the health system will be lower if we have comprehensive preventive services . " The apparent need for preventive care continues to permeate the current health care reform debate . <p> Like so many other bits of conventional wisdom , the facts of the matter are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in many cases , preventive medical care not only does n't save money , it may do little to prolong life . <p> Care must be taken to distinguish between " prevention , " broadly understood , and the more narrowly defined area of " preventive medical care . " Anything that can prevent a disease can be labeled prevention . Eating a proper diet , getting adequate exercise , avoiding being overweight , not smoking , drinking in moderation , proper sanitation , and immunization are all examples of prevention . The medical literature has conclusively demonstrated that many diseases and premature deaths are avoidable simply by choosing healthy eating and living habits . Two recent studies published in the Journal of the American Medical Association , for example , demonstrate that exercise enhances longevity . One followed more than 17,000 people over a span of more than 20 years , and found a strong correlation between vigorous exercise and increased life span . <p> In addition , public health efforts to do such things as clean up the water and improve sanitation have also proved to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to some health experts , most of the increases in life expectancy resulted not from advances in medicine , but from improvements in public health . " Most people would agree that medical care is not the most important factor in determining health , " says Jack Hadley , co-director of the Washington-based Center for Health Policy Studies . <p> Similarly , immunization has greatly reduced the likelihood of getting a variety of previously devastating diseases , such as polio , diphtheria , measles , and so on . <p> Preventive medical care , on the other hand , is a much more narrowly defined concept . It includes regular exams and screening tests designed to catch a disease or a health problem before it has a chance to produce any symptoms . <p> While said to save money by preventing the need for costly treatments down the road , study after study has shown that preventive medicine adds to overall health care costs . The reason is fairly straightforward : Testing everyone costs plenty of money . But the diseases that are being screened for are usually fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will likely benefit a relative few . And the savings often generated by catching these few diseases early are far outweighed by the cost of testing large populations of people . <p> Testing for and treating high blood pressure and high cholesterol , for example , costs more money than it saves by preventing stroke or heart disease . Health care outlays also exceed savings for cancer screening tests , according to studies published in peer-reviewed science and medical journals . The Office of Technology Assessment ( OTA ) studied the cost-effectiveness of adding coverage for several preventive measures  --  including flu and pneumonia vaccines , and screening tests for cervical and colon cancer  --  to the federal Medicare insurance program for the elderly . None of the preventive measures was found to cut costs . <p> In fact , a separate study by the OTA found that only three kinds of preventive care save money : prenatal care for poor women , tests in newborns for certain congenital disorders , and most childhood immunizations . <p> Critics of these cost-benefit analyses say that , while preventive screening may cost additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly if the costs are relatively low in terms of how many diseases or premature deaths are prevented . <p> But , it is not always and everywhere the case that preventive medical care does much of anything to improve health and prolong life . <p> A study by the Santa Monica , Calif. - based Rand Corp . found that preventive care had little effect on the health status of individuals . The study was part of the unprecedented Health Insurance Experiment conducted by the research organization . The experiment  --  which involved thousands of people  --  assigned participants randomly to different kinds of insurance plans to see how insurance coverage affected their use of medical services and their health outcomes . <p> As part of the study , Rand randomly assigned a physical exam at the beginning of the experiment . It found that after three years the health status of those who had the exam was essentially the same as those who did n't . <p> Further , those who sought out regular preventive care also showed little improvement over those who did n't . " Thus , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no appreciable effect , " the study concluded . <p> Nevertheless , the Rand study cautioned that the results do not amount to an indictment of preventive care in general . " Early detection of certain diseases has been critical to the survival of many , " it said . But even the claim that medical screening tests vastly improve health outcomes has come under criticism . <p> " By itself , even the most accurate screening accomplishes nothing , " writes Louise B. Russell , an economics professor and chair of the Division of Health Care Policy at Rutgers University , in her provocative book , Educated Guesses . " If it is to be effective , " she continues , " it must meet two more requirements : there must be more effective treatment for the condition , and treatment must be more effective when delivered early , before the disease becomes obvious through symptoms . " <p> Russell notes that if any of these stringent conditions are not met , then preventive care is essentially worthless . To understand how well screening tests meet these criteria , Russell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer and high blood cholesterol . She found serious drawbacks for each of them  --  drawbacks that often go overlooked when health professionals promote the need for regular preventive tests . These drawbacks included high rates of false positives where the test indicates a disease that does n't exist  --  and follow-up treatments that may do more harm than good . <p> Cervical Cancer . Early detection of cervical cancer in women is possible through the use of a test called the Pap smear . The test takes cell samples from various parts of a woman 's cervix , and studies them under a microscope for abnormalities that might indicate cancer or catch it at an early stage when it can be treated easily . <p> Regular screening is often recommended not only because early detection can prevent the cancer , but because the test itself often produces false negatives . Studies show that some 20% of cases of cervical cancer are likely to be missed by a single screening test . But , more frequent testing to overcome this problem can create another  --  false positives . As Russell explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ false positives , a problem that becomes more important with relatively rare diseases such as cervical cancer . <p> " Over the course of her lifetime , a woman is more likely to have a Pap test that incorrectly identifies her as having a condition that might develop into cervical cancer than she is to develop cervical cancer , " writes Russell . <p> The problem is that a false positive typically leads to additional tests and , in some cases , treatment . " Rather than take the chance of ignoring a true precursor condition , the physician may proceed with treatment , with its risks , pain , and costs in time and money . The risks include hemorrhage , infection , and unnecessary hysterectomy , " writes Russell . <p> Prostate Cancer . A newly developed blood test , called prostate-specific antigen , can help in the early detection of prostate cancer , a leading killer of men . The test is far superior to the digital exam . In that exam , the doctor is limited in how much of the prostate he can physically examine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch , the test can only detect more advanced tumors . <p> That 's the good news . The bad news is that prostate cancer does n't always kill . In fact , autopsy studies of men who died from diseases other than prostate cancer found that 30% nevertheless had tumors in their prostate . In other words , roughly 30% of prostate cancers in living men will likely pose no health threat whatsoever because these men will die of something else . <p> As a result , while the blood test improves cancer detection , it might lead to treatments in a substantial number of men for whom the cancer would have posed no problem if undetected . The concern is not a minor one . Treatment for prostate cancer typically involves removing the prostate , a procedure that often leads to incontinence or impotence . <p> " Side effects like these are enough to give a man pause as he considers whether to follow the American Cancer Society 's advice " to have a rectal exam every year , says Russell . <p> And , treatment may not prolong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force ( an expert panel convened by the Dept. of Health and Human Services ) notes that " the major randomized controlled trial comparing treatment of prostate cancer with no treatment found that radical prostatectomy removal of the prostate was no better than placebo in altering five-year survival . " <p> High Cholesterol . It is conventional wisdom that detecting and treating high cholesterol prolongs life . After all , high levels of cholesterol have been linked with heart disease , another leading killer . Regular screening for the problem is a recommended part of any regimen of preventive care , with treatment  --  either in the form of a special diet or drugs  --  recommended for high levels of LDL cholesterol . <p> Like tests for cervical and prostate cancer , cholesterol screening tests are prone to false positives . Tests of laboratories ' accuracy in measuring cholesterol levels have found errors of substantial magnitude . This problem is aggravated by the fact that an individual 's level can vary from day to day . And not everyone with high levels of cholesterol will suffer heart disease . In addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwanted side effects , including gastrointestinal problems , a higher risk of gallstones , and itching of the skin . <p> Even more startling , however , is the fact that , while studies show that reducing cholesterol levels can reduce the incidence of heart disease , it does n't prolong life . " Reducing blood cholesterol is associated with an increase in deaths from causes other than heart disease that cancels the decline in heart disease deaths , " writes Russell . <p> Some health professionals even recommend cholesterol screening for children , despite the fact that childhood levels of blood cholesterol are only loosely related to adult levels . In one study , only 44% of those children with high cholesterol levels had high levels as adults . ( See " Hyping Blood Cholesterol and Blood Pressure , " CR , March 1993 . ) <p> Russell complains that screening test guidelines often completely overlook these important caveats to testing . " These human costs  --  falsely positive tests and treatment that is not beneficial for the individual  --  are virtually ignored in the development of screening recommendations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus instead is on trying to ensure that no case of disease is missed . " <p> " Patients , clinicians , and payers need to recognize the extent to which the guidelines gloss over or ignore considerations of potentially great importance to them . For patients , the questions have to do with whether a screening test is the best way to spend time , emotional energy , and money to preserve or improve personal health . " <p> Finally , it is not all that clear that health insurance benefit plans must include coverage for preventive care to induce people to get tested regularly . Debates over reforming the nation 's health care system often include a discussion about whether preventive care should be made a mandatory part of any insurance plan sold in the country . Last year , for example , nearly every health care reform bill introduced in Congress would have required coverage for annual physical exams . <p> The idea behind such a mandate is that people have little incentive to get screened for possible diseases before they have any symptoms , particularly if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or exams . Making preventive care free to the consumer , the argument goes , will encourage more preventive tests . <p> Because of this way of thinking , innovative health care reform ideas like Medical Savings Accounts ( MSAs ) are often criticized for the possibility that they might discourage use of preventive medical care . Under an MSA plan , a person would buy a high-deductible health insurance policy . Because high-deductible plans cost much less than low-deductible policies , the premium savings from buying the high-deductible plan could be put in a savings account . Any money left unspent would be kept by the enrollee . Some Republicans want to encourage use of MSA plans by making the savings accounts tax deductible . But critics say that MSAs might encourage people to save the money , rather than spend it on preventive care . <p> Unfortunately , even if preventive care were always a good value , making it free to the consumer probably will do little to encourage more of it . In the Rand Health Insurance Experiment , participants were randomly assigned to different kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as annual physical exams , while others did n't . <p> The results ? " When we looked at enrollees on the plan that required no out-of-pocket costs to the patient  --  a plan much more generous than those commonly available  --  we found that substantial fractions of the population were still not seeking or getting the well care that the medical profession recommends .
