<p> A college basketball coach walked into Morris High School 's fieldhouse on a hot , muggy Sunday , picked up a program and began to get his bearings . <p> " Where is court 3 ? " he asked . " Is Matt Heldman playing today ? What about Curtis Ganes ? Do they really have to play three games in six hours in this heat ? Is there a good restaurant in town ? " <p> Suddenly , before he could find an empty seat , a player on a nearby court leaped above the rim to block a shot , grabbed the ball in mid-air , dribbled down the floor , faked right , went behind his back , drove left and slam dunked over a taller defender . It looked like an NBA highlight film . <p> " Hey , who is that ? What team does he play for ? " the coach asked , rapidly flipping through his list of names and numbers . " Is he a senior or an underclassman ? Where did he come from ? " <p> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . In their insatiable quest for fame , fortune and a college scholarship , Chicago-area players traveled from Ypsilanti , Mich. , to Indianapolis to Pittsburgh to Phoenix to Las Vegas to Los Angeles to impress college recruiters . <p> Some did , some did n't . <p> So who 's hot and who 's not ? <p> Here is an analysis of the top players and teams in the wake of the spring and summer competition , based on evaluations of several college coaches and talent scouts : King once again is the team to beat for the 1994 Class AA state championship . Carbondale is the leading Downstate contender . St. Martin de Porres is the early favorite in Class A. Based on spring and summer performances , Simeon 's Bryant Notree rates over Mount Carmel 's Antoine Walker as the area 's No. 1 senior prospect . But some college coaches and talent scouts claim Farragut sophomore Ronnie Fields might be the state 's best player . Based on July evaluations , 14 Illinois seniors , the most ever , rank among the nation 's Top 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , St. Joseph 's Rodney Horton ( 45 ) , Farragut 's Curtis Ganes ( 49 ) , Springfield 's Tyron Lee ( 52 ) , Peoria Manual 's Brandon Hughes ( 57 ) , Cairo 's Tyrone Nesby ( 60 ) , Rockford Boylan 's Lee Lampley ( 63 ) , Carbondale 's Rashaad Tucker ( 66 ) , St. Martin de Porres ' Jerry Gee ( 68 ) , Mount Carmel 's Willie Jones ( 80 ) , Westinghouse 's Mark Miller ( 85 ) and Damion Dantzler ( 94 ) and Corliss ' Leroy Watkins ( 98 ) . The nation 's No. 1 player is 6-8 Andrae Patterson of Abilene , Texas , who orally committed to Indiana last week . <p> " Patterson has the whole package , " talent scout David Kaplan said . " He combines athleticism , intensity and skill with outstanding demeanor - and he is an academic qualifier . He fits into coach Bob Knight 's program . He will flourish in the Hoosier system . " <p> Kaplan says Patterson is a solid but not clear-cut choice as No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 1 choices such as Shaquille O'Neal or Danny Manning or Anfernee Hardaway . The No. 2 choice , 6-10 Raef La Frentz of Monona , Iowa , is described as " the next Kevin McHale . " He might be leaning to Kansas but Iowa and Indiana are in the hunt . The nation 's most talented player could be 6-8 Jerod Ward of Clinton , Miss . He is considering Kentucky , Louisville and Duke . Point guard Allen Iverson of Hampton , Va. , has the complete package , too . Some talent scouts and college coaches rank him No. 1 . But what about his future ? Will he play in 1993-94 ? <p> Iverson was recently convicted on three felony counts after being involved in a bowling alley brawl in February . He will be sentenced Aug. 18 . And the NCAA is investigating alleged improprieties when he accepted free airline tickets from Nike officials to travel from a court date to compete at a Nike all-star game in Indianapolis . Patterson is n't the only Top 100 prospect who has made an oral commitment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Kentucky ) , guard Neil Reed ( 43 ) of Metairie , La. , ( Indiana ) , 6-7 Bob Brannen ( 69 ) of Cincinnati ( Cincinnati ) and guard Drew Maddux ( 70 ) of Madison , Tenn. , ( Vanderbilt ) . Illinois , desperate to add size to its roster , wants 6-10 Jahidi White of St. Louis . But the Illini do n't figure . White is considering Missouri , Indiana , Kentucky and St. Louis University . Will 6-8 Willie Mitchell of Detroit choose Michigan ? Once considered a lock to become a Wolverine , Mitchell might be considering other options since Michigan coach Steve Fisher failed to hire Mitchell 's high school coach to replace Perry Watson on his staff . Watson became coach at Detroit Mercy . Michigan must have a big recruiting year . Fisher must replace Chris Webber and he figures to lose Jalen Rose and former Chicago Vocational star Juwan Howard after next season . Fisher hopes to get Mitchell , Walker and Gee from Chicago and he is favored to get 6-9 Corey Louis ( 12 ) of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top recruiting classes in 1993-94 . Coach Jim Harrick , armed with a new contract , is expected to obtain commitments from 6-10 Omm'a Givens ( 7 ) of Aberdeen , Wash. , and 6-5 Toby Bailey ( 18 ) of Los Angeles . DePaul is in the final four with Notree and Horton , in the final five with 6-8 Alex Sanders ( 14 ) of Mouth of Wilson , Va. , in the final 10 with 6-9 Samaki Walker ( 9 ) of Columbus , Ohio , and is in the chase for 6-9 Brian Skinner ( 82 ) of Temple , Texas . Illinois coach Lou Henson hopes to land Notree , Walker and Lee . Chicago-area products who almost earned spots among the Top 100 were Libertyville guard Matt Heldman ( 105 ) , Rich Central guard Sean Mason ( 107 ) and Orr 's 6-6 Willie Farley ( 111 ) . <p> More than any other area player , Farley 's stock skyrocketed during the summer . He emerged at the end of last season , scoring 39 points against Westinghouse . He impressed scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer league competition . A good athlete , he can score and handle the ball . But he must become an academic qualifier . Homewood-Flossmoor 's 6-7 Michael Bowens was a disappointment . He was invited to the Nike All-America camp but did n't play well . He ranked among the Top 100 in some pre-July evaluations but dropped to No. 130 on Kaplan 's list . <p> " Against the best players in the country , he struggled , " Kaplan said . " He needs to get stronger . " Another disappointment was Downers Grove South 's 6-4 Adam Shafer . He ranked as high as No. 51 in a pre-July evaluation but dropped to No. 150 . He also was invited to the Nike camp but did n't play up to expectations . <p> " He has great athleticism but he has n't gained strength throughout his high school career and has n't improved greatly in three years since coming into high school as a phenom , " Kaplan said . " Some coaches wonder which position he can play in college . He went from ( Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recruiters . " Questions about the health of King 's Michael Hermon , who spent most of the summer recovering from a gunshot wound , were answered when the 6-4 senior was named MVP while leading Team Illinois to the championship of the LA Gear Shootout in Los Angeles . If he is healthy , he is a top 50 prospect . The Class of 1994 has no pure centers among the Top 100 who can step right in and play in the NBA . Last year 's class had at least three centers with NBA potential - Philadelphia 's Rasheed Wallace ( North Carolina ) and King 's Rashard Griffith ( Wisconsin ) and Thomas Hamilton ( Pittsburgh ) . But the Class of 1994 is very deep , according to Kaplan , with at least five or six players who could become NBA stars . However , it does n't have one marquee player who is a clear-cut choice as the No. 1 prospect . " But it has more depth than we 've seen in last five years , " Kaplan said . Of the Top 10 players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ La Frentz , Givens , White and Samaki Walker . That is in sharp contrast to past years when only one or two qualified . <p> " While some kids will never wake up and smell the coffee , some understand that if they do n't have grades , they wo n't play , " Kaplan said . " College coaches are getting away from signing Proposition 48 players en masse . Maybe one or two , but not many . " <p> It 's the new way of doing business .
