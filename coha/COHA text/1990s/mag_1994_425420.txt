A maverick earthquake theory spells trouble for tall buildings <p> Even in her dreams , Shannon Jones could n't escape the faint buzz emanating from the television across the room . The college senior finally dragged herself out of bed at 3:00 a , m. to turn off the set , figuring that maybe now she could get some rest . But even as she drifted off to sleep that morning , a long-dormant fault deep beneath her apartment building started to reawaken . <p> Twenty kilometers under California 's San Fernando Valley , the rock layers had reached their breaking point . At one minute past 4:30 a.m. on Jan. 23 , a crack shot up through the crust , releasing stress that had accumulated over decades . <p> The sudden movement sent waves of seismic energy racing at 21,000 km per hour toward Jones ' first-floor apartment in the Northridge Meadows complex . They slammed against the building , hitting it repeatedly until the three-story structure gave way . <p> A piece of the ceiling dropped on Jones , and she ran toward the bedroom door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student raced in the opposite direction , stepping on broken glass to jump through her shattered window . Moments later , the building buckled , collapsing the very hallway toward which Jones had originally run . Sixteen of her neighbors in first-floor rooms perished as their ceilings cared in upon them . <p> With its $15 billion in damages , the Northridge quake enters the record books as the most costly U.S. earthquake yet . But like any large tremor , it has provided important lessons about how Earth moves and how best to prepare for coming disasters . <p> The recordings of ground motion collected during the Northridge quake and a quake 2 years ago are now convincing many seismologists and engineers that earthquakes carry a previously unappreciated hazard , a type of motion that some call seismic fling . <p> Unlike the typical vibrations , which rattle both near and far regions , the fling effect only occurs close to the earthquake source . But because it literally pulls the ground out from under structures , then yanks it quickly back again , this phenomenon has the potential to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . <p> While those who draft building codes are only now recognizing the hazard of seismic fling , hints of this phenomenon surfaced in earthquakes as far back as 1966 . But the previous examples were not obvious , and few people focused attention on this type of movement . <p> " They were seen , but people did not understand their significance at the time , " says seismologist Thomas H. Heaton of the U.S. Geological Survey in Pasadena , Calif. , who has investigated the problem for many years and recently started drawing attention to its dangers . <p> Heaton shuns the term " fling " because it gives the impression of starting in one place and ending in another . He uses " displacement pulse " to describe how the ground rapidly shifts a significant distance in one direction and then back . <p> In the past , Heaton 's mathematical simulations of earthquakes showed that displacement pulses should occur . But it was n't until June 28 , 1992 , when a magnitude 7.3 quake struck near the town of Landers in the Mojave Desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear example in nature . <p> Engineer Wilfred D. Iwan of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena found evidence of a dramatic displacement pulse while examining records taken only 2 km from a fault in the Mojave . As the fault broke during the Landers quake , the ground underneath the seismometer shifted 60 centimeters away from the fault and then back in less than 5 seconds . <p> Iwan bolstered his case by checking the instrument that recorded the pulse . In his lab last summer , he recalibrated the sensor , ensuring that it had correctly measured the ground motion . Iwan presented his findings in April at the annual meeting of the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute . <p> " This provides everybody now with something that says we really measured the effect . It 's not just a theoretical fault model anymore . It 's something we measured in the field , and we have to be concerned about it , " says Iwan . <p> Iwan recently detected displacement pulses in the records of the Northridge earthquake as well . But because the faulting did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation than the one at Landers . Some of the pulses recorded in January may equal , if not exceed , the size of those measured during the Landers earthquake , Iwan says . <p> With future work , engineers and seismologists can potentially link the displacement pulses to particular regions of damage . The stations that recorded the pulses during the Northridge quake are located north of the epicenter in the Santa Susana Mountains and the Santa Clarita Valley beyond . <p> Because this same area suffered significant damage , Iwan wonders whether the displacement pulses are to blame . " There 's a suspicion , at least , that there is a correlation . But that has n't been verified yet , " he says . <p> Heaton 's explorations of displacement pulses have led him to adopt an unconventional theory of faulting , which he believes explains how earthquakes can produce this type of motion . <p> His maverick model takes issue with the standard image of an earthquake , in which a fracture spreads like a zipper opening a jacket . According to the traditional theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually unlocks a long stretch of fault . Once freed , rock on one side of the fault can slip past rock on the other side . So if an earthquake breaks a 50-km-long fault , the crust along this entire length will be moving by the time the rupture reaches its stopping point 20 seconds later . <p> Heaton , however , argues that an earthquake does n't unlock a long stretch at once , but rather creates a small break that moves . A crack measuring a kilometer or two in length propagates along a fault like two zippers traveling together , one behind the other , The leading edge of the rupture frees the fault , then the rear of the crack seals the rock together only a second or two later . Heaton calls this a self-healing fracture . <p> This novel vision of faulting , if true , would change theories about how earthquakes work and deflate hopes for predicting quakes ( see sidebar ) , At the same time , the self-healing fracture model also suggests that sites near a fault will experience displacement pulses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crack passes a particular spot , it causes nearby land to shift away from the fault and then back toward the fault . The larger the earthquake , the greater the displacement . <p> While many experts now accept that the ground can move fast and far during quakes , they do n't necessarily buy Heaton 's theoretical arguments about the cause . Although no one has explored the idea yet , some believe that the traditional theory of fault rupture may also explain seismic fling . " I strongly expect that the standard model will show a similar effect , " says James R. Rice , who studies faulting at Harvard University , <p> James H. Dieterich , a researcher with USGS in Menlo Park , Calif. , also remains skeptical about Heaton 's theory , " What Tom is saying is possible , " Dieterich says . " But in my opinion , it 's quite a ways from being demonstrated and I 'd rather stick with conventional physics for now . " <p> Whether or not Heaton succeeds in rewriting seismological theory , he is spurring engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of displacement pulses . <p> Heaton and Caltech engineer John F. Hall recently demonstrated how this phenomenon could cause acute problems for high-rise buildings , even those built to the stringent safety codes of Los Angeles . The researchers discovered these weaknesses while modeling how a 20-story building would respond to a hypothetical magnitude 7 earthquake located 10 km away <p> In their calculations , the ground beneath the building shifted to the southwest by more than 1.6 meters ( 5.2 feet ) and then slid back to its original position in roughly 5 seconds . Because the building is tall and flexible , however , it could n't withstand that motion . <p> Imagine the base of the building shifting to the southwest while the top floors lag behind . By the time the top floors start swinging to the southwest , the bottom of the building is moving in the opposite direction . The result : a structure headed rapidly toward the horizontal . <p> " If you move the base of a building a large distance , basically you 're knocking the legs out from underneath it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns stay vertical . If they tilt very much , they 're in trouble , " says Heaton . Indeed , Hall calculates that this hypothetical 20-story structure would topple if subjected to such movement . <p> ( As if the displacement pulse would not do enough damage , the Northridge quake also revealed other problems . Numerous steel buildings developed cracks in connections between beams and columns , greatly reducing the strength of these structures . Engineers do not yet know how well steel buildings will stand up to a stronger quake . ) <p> Even before the high-rise experiment , Heaton had started worrying about the consequences of displacement pulses . Those thoughts first came while he visited the basement of a base-isolated building - a design that uses rubber pads or springs to separate the building from the foundation . <p> Because it reduces shaking , this system is growing more popular in seismically active cities . Builders increasingly are using it in critical facilities such as hospitals or emergency services offices . To Heaton , however , the base-isolation design seems ill-suited to handle a large displacement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base-isolated buildings already completed in the Los Angeles area rode through the vibrations quite well . But the closest structure , a wing of the University of Southern California Hospital , sat a comfortable 35 km from the epicenter . <p> If the same building had stood in Sylmar , much closer to the fault , it would not have fared as well , says Caltech 's Iwan . The displacement pulse measured in Sylmar would have moved the hospital 40 cm during the quake . But the gap between the building and a surrounding concrete enclosure allows only 26 cm of movement , notes Iwan , The hospital would have crashed into concrete walls at a speed of 1.3 m per second . For comparison , consider walking at a brisk pace smack into a concrete wall . <p> " One would have to have serious concern about the performance of that structure had it been located in Sylmar , " Iwan says . <p> As chairman of the California Seismic Safety Commission , Iwan can do something about the new findings . After the Northridge earthquake , Governor Pete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building code . As currently written , the code deals primarily with the forces generated during an earthquake and therefore does not directly address the issue of rapid displacements that occur during seismic fling . <p> The issue of fling is not just a southern California concern . Scientists and engineers in the San Francisco Bay area must also grapple with this phenomenon , because several quake-producing faults underlie this region as well . <p> Iwan and others note that seismic fling does n't threaten an entire area shaken by a quake , because large displacements only occur in the " near field "  --  the land closest to a fault . But he says researchers have not yet defined how far the near field area extends from a fault . <p> Answering the question " How close is too close ? " is particularly difficult in the Los Angeles Basin , a region riddled with known and unknown faults . <p> " If you have the possibility of these earthquakes anywhere in the basin , " asks Iwan , " do you zone the whole basin for this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Does it mean restrictions on types of structures or heights of structures ? I do n't know the answer to that . " <p> PHOTO : The weak first floor of the Northridge Meadows apartment complex collapsed , while the second and third stories remained essentially intact . <p> PHOTO : A severely damaged apartment building in Northridge . After the quake , inspectors declared unsafe approximately 3,000 buildings in the Los Angeles area . <p> DIAGRAM : When a displacement pulse passes a tall building and pulls the lower floors to the left , the top floors remain stationary ( 1 ) . Soon the upper stories catch up and the entire building moves to the left ( 2 ) . Then the pulse reverses , pulling the lower floors to the right even as the top floors continue to the left ( 3 ) . As the ground returns to its original position , the building deforms and may collapse ( 4 ) . <p> By RICHARD MONASTERSKY <p> A CARPET-LAYER 'S GUIDE TO EARTHQUAKE THEORY <p> Do earthquakes follow some predictable pattern , or do they obey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer depends on the way the crust breaks  --  a secret that seismologists have yet to unlock . <p> The traditional concept of an earthquake holds that stress gradually increases in the crust until it exceeds the friction pressing two sides of a fault together . At first a small patch of rock starts to slide . Then the rupture grows until it frees a large zone . As the blocks of crust slip , they release most of the pent-up energy that had accumulated for decades . <p> Because the stress on the fault increases by a steady amount each decade , this suggests that  --  in theory at least  --  seismologists could forecast the general timing of an earthquake . In fact , U.S. researchers have used the concept to gauge the long-term seismic risk for different parts of California . <p> But some measurements of faults and earthquakes have raised questions about the standard theory . Heat presents one problem . If friction on a fault really did reach expected levels , then slippage of rock during earthquakes should generate tremendous amounts of heat that would persist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come up cold . <p> Scientists also think that earthquakes release far less stress than the standard model would predict , says Thomas H. Heaton of the U.S. Geological Survey . <p> In thinking about these problems , Heaton and other seismologists have resurrected a different earthquake theory , proposed long ago but never accepted . According to this rival idea , stresses need not build to a set level before a fault can slip . Fluids in the crust or other factors can temporarily reduce the friction on a fault , enabling it to fail at any time . When it does start sliding , the fault does not slip all at once . Rather , a small gap runs down the fault , unlocking rock in front and sealing rock behind . <p> According to Heaton , it is much easier for rock to slide this way . He likens the two sides of a fault to a carpet sitting on a floor . Imagine trying to move the carpet several inches . Instead of dragging the whole piece at once , it would take less effort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpet . <p> The self-healing slip model would solve some of the problems raised by the standard theory . Because faults slip under much lower frictional forces , earthquakes would produce less heat . Unfortunately , the unconventional model also bodes ill for earthquake predictions . If true , scientists could not count on faults behaving regularly . with stress building up to a certain level before triggering an earthquake . <p> By R. Monastersky <p>
