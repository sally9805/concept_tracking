One summer evening , I watched the tide as it flowed gently up the creek like a river in reverse , creeping slowly over the salt-marsh shore in Norfolk , England . Out of the corner of my eye I saw a flash of red . A small , shiny black-and-red beetle had run in and out of its burrow ; then , moments later , it disappeared under the rising water . I had not expected to see a land beetle here , but remembered reading about a species that lives in intertidal zones . Was this the salt-marsh beetle ? Yes , it was Bledius spectabilis , a staphylinid beetle about half an inch long . During the next low tide , I discovered hundreds of burrows among the Salicornia  --  stubby little plants with water-swollen stems  --  that follow a contour around the salt-marsh creeks . Each burrow had a characteristic little heap of tailings above its entrance . The beetle I saw had emerged to scrape algae from around the burrow 's entrance ; then it carried the morsels down below , to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a difficult habitat that few animals can exploit . It is between land and sea , and a creature adapted to one is often poorly adapted to the other . Most intertidal animals are essentially marine species , such as crabs , that colonize the land . Their major risk is drying out on a sandy beach or rocky shore . By contrast , muddy salt-marsh shores in northern Europe , with their wetland acres of mud and quiet creeks , can support such land animals as spiders and mites that have moved into intertidal zones . Some have evolved great tolerance for seawater and can pump excess salt from their bodies ; others simply develop behaviors to avoid getting drenched . Insects ' cuticles are already impermeable to prevent water loss on land , but their main challenge has been to adjust to the tides . Those that have adapted to life in this difficult environment can exploit a rich habitat . The only serious competitor of Bledius is the gray mullet , a fish that comes in at high tide and also feeds on shoreline algae , leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may occupy hundreds of square yards in the intertidal zone , with densities of a thousand adults per square yard . Colony perimeters are abrupt ; no beetles dig burrows outside its boundaries . Sometimes the muddy beach is covered with beetles ; on a given shore , they can number in the millions . How does this land beetle survive the twice daily tides without any special bodily adaptations ? It lacks , for example , snorkel tubes that might allow it to breathe under water . The answer lies in its behavior : the salt-marsh beetle builds and maintains a snug , watertight burrow . And the females are good parents , protecting their eggs and larvae from predators as well as from the tides . When I first dug up some burrows , I could see that they were made with care and were perhaps the key to understanding the beetles ' adaptation . The mud is firm and will hold any shape into which it is sculpted ; a pencil hole made in the surface will last for many weeks . To study the burrows ' shapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few burrows with clear silicone resin . When the clear , hardened resin cast was removed from the mud , the egg chambers , each containing an egg , resembled miniature table-tennis balls stuck to the burrow 's characteristic " wine bottle " shape . The burrow is about two and one-half inches long , with a living chamber one-quarter of an inch in diameter ; a narrow neck three-quarters of an inch long opens out to the surface . The individual egg chambers extend from the living space . I saw no evidence that burrows ever become flooded , even at high tide . To find out why , I sculpted an artificial burrow in clear agar ( the kind of gel used for bacterial plates ) and then submerged it . At first the narrow neck seemed effective in keeping the water out , while artificial burrows with wider openings quickly became flooded . Eventually , however , even narrow-necked burrows took on water . Since this did n't happen in the field , I introduced a female beetle into one of my transparent burrows to observe her during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the " tide " began , the beetle suddenly ran up to the burrow neck and sealed the entrance with a neat plug of agar " mud , " taken in mouthfuls from the walls . When I tested for the same behavior in the salt marsh , burrows from which I removed the female did indeed flood , while those with a female inside remained dry . Rather than anticipate the tide and block their burrows in advance , females can continue to feed until the very last moment , when the water reaches their doorstep . A dry , sealed burrow poses other dangers , however . Salt-marsh beetles usually burrow into " blue " mud , which is so tightly compacted that it allows no oxygen into the burrows . ( This mud is unlike the surrounding , looser , aerobic " brown " mud , which is tinged by iron oxides . ) During low tide , when the burrows must be reopened to allow oxygen replenishment , each beetle pushes up a new heap of tailings as it clears the entrance of washed-in debris . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tides can a female salt-marsh beetle rear eggs and larvae in the airless mud  --  a life style very much like that of fiddler crabs . For most of the year , male Bledius dig burrows very similar to those of females , but without the egg chambers . During the spring , they walk the marsh surfaces in search of mates , pausing at burrow entrances . If caught by the tide during their search , males grip the mud and flip their abdomens over their heads to create an air bubble . After the tide subsides , those that remain continue their search , but many have been washed away . When he finds a female that allows him access , the male stays with her for some hours underground , where copulation takes place . Right after mating , the male leaves and goes in search of another female . After fertilization , the female lays an egg every other day in an individual chamber off the main burrow . After about twenty-seven days , the first-instar larva hatches , crawls into the main living chamber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eight days later , it leaves to dig its own burrow . After six more days , it molts into a second instar ; then into a third , thirteen days later . It remains in its third and final instar stage for twenty-eight days . Finally , it spends about fifteen days as a pupa . A beetle 's development from egg to adult takes about a hundred days during a British summer . Since older larvae were found alone in their own burrows , I wondered at what stage they venture above ground . William Foster , of Cambridge University , and I went to the salt marsh about midnight with red flashlights to observe the tiny first instars . They come out only at night and walk over the beach exploring every crevice and dimple in the mud . ( They were very interested in a hole I made with a pencil point . ) If a larva ventures into an occupied burrow , the owner chases off the intruder , which continues to search for a home . Within dense colonies , the young larvae roam in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight lines through areas without burrow entrances . These movement patterns ( also used by parasitoid wasps hunting for hosts ) tend to keep the larvae within the colony . For the dispersing larvae , survival is a race against two clocks . They have to find or dig a burrow before the next tide washes them away or before the sun rises , whichever comes first . At night most predatory shorebirds are asleep . The mud is cool and damp , making burrowing easy . The air is relatively humid , so the larvae ( accustomed to high humidity below ground ) do not risk drying out . On a summer day , the salt-marsh surface is a baking desert covered with salt crystals . By emerging at night , the instar larvae are protected from some hazards , but are exposed to others . During our nocturnal prowls , we noticed hundreds of carabid beetles , whose numbers on the muddy beach peak about midnight . Before long , we saw one bump into a first-instar salt-marsh beetle and eat it . Soon we realized that all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As though in a game of " blindman 's bluff , " the predators lunged in the direction of larvae as soon as their antennae touched one . Sometimes larvae escaped by suddenly running backward or forward ( they can move just as fast in either direction ) or by jerking their heads . With such tactics , they were able to escape about half the encounters with carabids . But when we plucked newly hatched first instars from maternal burrows and placed them on the beach , they were always caught . And when we removed females , we found that the burrows were soon invaded by carabid adults that fed on newly hatched larvae . Once a larva has successfully emerged , run the midnight gauntlet on the beach , and dug itself a home , it may be safe . Most predators are too large to descend into a larva 's burrow , which is very similar to that of an adult . For the rest of its life , the larva does not travel again , coming up to the burrow 's entrance only to collect algae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows . Unlike adults , the larvae leave their feces neatly at the side of the burrow , instead of at the bottom . One summer , we were fascinated to see a female parasitoid wasp walking along the flat mud , stopping at each heap of beetle tailings . We marked each one she visited with a little numbered flag . Within ninety-nine minutes she had visited sixty-two heaps , walking a total of fifty-nine feet , but there was more to the story . After investigating some heaps with her antennae , she quickly moved on . At others she patted the little mound with her antennae and then vigorously probed with her ovipositor to find the hole hidden below . If successful , she lifted up her wings and , ovipositor first , disappeared down the burrow for up to six minutes . Underground , we learned later , the wasp had attempted to paralyze the resident larva with its sting in order to lay a pearly white egg inside its body . Why did she behave so differently on different heaps ? To find out , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a burrow contained a lone larva , the wasp had usually entered , but if an adult female was present , in thirteen out of fourteen cases the wasp did not enter . When the female beetle is with her young , she defends them vigorously . Her good-sized jaws can nip , and she also lifts her poison-tipped abdomen over her head to jab at an intruder . Glands in the tip emit noxious chemicals , some of which smell strong even to humans . Perhaps the pungent odor of adult females alerts the wasps to stay away from guarded burrows . A parasitoid wasp that hatches out of a beetle larva must emerge from its pupa , mate , and find salt-marsh beetle larvae to parasitize , all between tides . Once inside the unfortunate beetle larva , the wasp 's egg is protected from saltwater and predators . After depositing her eggs , a female wasp is swept up in the next tide and ends as lifeless flotsam . When mature , the wasp larva bursts out of its living larder and spins a cocoon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its last act , emerging as an adult wasp the next summer . Parental care appears to have evolved independently in several groups of beetles in similar environments . Ecologist Ellinor Larsen , working in Danish salt marshes in the 1930s , found two other species in which the mother digs narrow-necked burrows and remains with her eggs . ( The three species belong to unrelated beetle families : the Staphylinidae , Carabidae , and Heteroceridae . ) When she compared close relatives of the salt-marsh beetles , Larson found one species that lives a few yards below them on the shore and also cares for its eggs and larvae . However , other closely related species that inhabit the high marsh or sand dunes , rarely covered by tides , do not show any parental care at all . Apparently , species that burrow in fast-draining , aerated , sandy beaches can also safely leave their eggs . So parental care seems to be an adaptation to the combined dangers of tidal flooding and airtight burrows . Additional advantages , such as foiling predators and reducing larval parasitism , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the muddy shore , increasing aeration and drainage . Now the soil is just right for bushy salt-marsh plants that move in and proliferate , shading and killing the algae on which beetles feed . Soon , only abandoned burrows remain under these bushes , and the beetles must find a new young marsh to colonize . Neither time nor tide waits for these beetles .
