This seems to be the season for wonder-drug books . Even as The Redux Revolution hits the shelves at Barnes &; Noble , two other breathless volumes  --  The Super-Hormone Promise , by Dr. William Regelson and Carol Colman , and The DHEA Breakthrough , by Stephen Cherniske  --  are promoting testosterone , DHEA and other hormones as medical miracles that can slow or even reverse aging . <P> However , not all wonder drugs are created equal . Redux , despite the controversy that surrounds it , has a legitimate scientific pedigree . It has undergone thorough testing in animals and humans  --  including several large clinical trials  --  and has passed muster with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration . <P> DHEA , by comparison , is the modern equivalent of a patent medicine  --  an interesting compound being sold as a cure-all on the basis of the flimsiest scientific evidence . Like human-growth hormone and melatonin , two other drugs being promoted as antiaging compounds , DHEA is a medically active chemical with real value that has piqued the interest of mainstream scientists . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual vigor , prevent cancer and heart disease , and add decades to your life  --  run far ahead of the science . <P> DHEA ( short for dehydroepiandrosterone ) is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands , tiny sacs that sit atop the kidneys . The body converts it into testosterone and estrogen in both men and women ( albeit in different amounts ) . What makes DHEA so intriguing is that it seems to act like a biochemical marker for aging . People churn out copious quantities until the age of 30 , when the levels in the blood start to decline . By the time they are 80 , men and women have less than 5% of the DHEA they had at their physical and sexual peak . <P> Does that mean that taking DHEA can somehow stave off the aging process ? When scientists tested this proposition on animals , they found to their astonishment that it seemed to do just that . When older , slower mice were given DHEA , they became more active and learned as easily as younger rodents to run mazes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer , diabetes and heart disease . <P> But all these effects were found in laboratory animals , not humans . Generalizing from mice to men is always risky , and it 's even more so in this case because unlike humans , rats and mice make little or no DHEA on their own . Without conducting large studies of DHEA 's effects on human subjects , nothing definitive can really be said . <P> Such in-depth research is only getting under way . In the interim , DHEA boosters point hopefully to a couple of small studies by Dr. Samuel Yen of the University of California at San Diego . They showed that giving DHEA to middle-age men and women elevated levels of yet another hormone , called insulin-like growth factor , which stimulates cell growth and cell division . Most of the subjects taking the hormone reported they felt more energetic , happier and better able to cope with stress . But neither finding , as Yen himself acknowledges , proves that aging has been reversed .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
