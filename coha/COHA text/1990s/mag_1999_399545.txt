<p> It 's a land of instant millionaires where mansions grow like toadstools  --  and of desperate poverty , widening income disparity and one of the nation 's fastest-growing homeless populations <p> As the sun goes down over Silicon Valley , Thad Wingate vibrates with mad energy . It 's the end of his workday as a driver for Guaranteed Express , a local courier service . He seems to have absorbed all the tension and stress and speed that are channeled through the highways of Silicon Valley , and now , as darkness falls , he radiates it back like heat off a rock . He 's six feet six , wire thin , and his wraparound sunglasses are permanently glued over his eyes . Every day he logs roughly 400 miles , delivering business plans to high-tech execs and diapers to rich housewives and T-bone steaks to busy hotels . He takes home about $2,400 a month  --  a decent salary , you 'd think . But home , for the moment , is the Emergency Housing Consortium 's James F. Boccardo Regional Reception Center in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Wingate 's six-week-old daughter died in his arms , a victim of sudden infant death syndrome . He was overcome with grief . His marriage unraveled , he lost his job at a testing lab and started doing an eight ball of crank a day . He spent a few months in jail , got clean and now is trying to reassemble his life  --  not an easy task in the hard-charging world of Silicon Valley . <p> Inside the shelter 's main room , where about 125 beds are arranged in rows , the air is stale and sweaty . Wingate picks up a " fresh " bedroll from a pile near the front door  --  a scratchy wool blanket , a threadbare sheet . " My big dream right now , " he says , holding the bedroll as if it were a dead animal , " is to sleep on my own sheets again . " <p> As in most shelters , the crowd includes ex-cons , recovering alcoholics and the mentally ill . But there 's also a surprising number of working people : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rican woman in a McDonald 's uniform , a middle-aged trucker . Many of them are wearing faded T-shirts with high-tech logos : APPLE , ORACLE , SUN MICROSYSTEMS . Like Air-Jordans in the South Bronx , these T-shirts are status items in the shelter , links to the better world that these people are living right in the middle of but can not touch . <p> IN SILICON VALLEY , IT 'S HARD NOT to feel lucky . The sky is Netscape blue , the hills are dotted with oaks and horses , the Fry 's Electronics stores are stocked with every gizmo a geek could want . And , of course , money is gushing down El Camino Real , the Valley 's main drag , like water through a broken dam . According to recent data compiled by the San Jose Mercury News , 65,000 Santa Clara County residents  --  roughly one in nine  --  are worth more than $1 million apiece , not including the values of their homes . There are several hundred residents worth $25 million or more and at least thirteen billionaires in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sign that this is going to slow down anytime soon : In 1997 , $1.1 billion in venture capital was invested in Bay-area companies ; in just the first six months of 1999 , the number was $2.6 billion . John Doerr , a pioneering venture capitalist with Kleiner Perkins Caufield &; Byers , in Menlo Park , has often called Silicon Valley " the largest legal creation of wealth in the history of the planet . " <p> The wealth machine has n't only created millionaires . Between January 1995 and June 1998 , Silicon Valley created 171,000 new jobs . The average annual wage in the region is $48,000 , the highest in the country and $18,000 above the national average . For people with decent technical skills , jobs that pay $75,000 a year are a dime a dozen . <p> But the new economy has not been so generous to people without technical skills or college degrees . Between 1991 and 1997 , the median income for the lowest twenty percent of households in the Valley increased by just five percent . Meanwhile , the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles . It is now the highest in the country  --  thirty-seven percent above the national average . The median price for a home is $410,000 , more than twice the average for the rest of the country . Studio apartments in bad neighborhoods rent for $1,000 a month ; a decent one-bedroom goes for $1,500 . The price for a gallon of regular gas hovered around $1.80 for most of the summer , some fifty cents above what much of the rest of the country paid . This January , after a federal rent-assistance program reopened in the area , 19,000 people applied in the first week alone . " If you have a family and you 're not making $75,000 a year , " says Brian Reed , a case manager at the EHC shelter , " a decent life is an unattainable goal . " <p> Wingate is finding it almost impossible to locate a place to live . " I could leave the area , of course , but then when would I see my son ? " he asks . " As soon as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to rent to you . They all have fifty people calling for every vacancy  --  none of them want to rent to someone like me . " <p> Not surprisingly , lots of people are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with life in the Silicon Valley fast lane . In 1995 ( the last year for which figures are available ) , thirteen percent of children in Santa Clara County were living below the poverty line . That amounts to more than 55,000 kids . The high school dropout rate has steadily increased during the last six years . Domestic abuse is up , road rage is epidemic , and AA meetings around the Valley are packed with people who wonder why they are working so hard and getting nowhere . Second Harvest , the Valley 's largest food bank , served 19.3 million pounds of food in 1997 ; this year , the agency is on target to do the same . Sixty-one percent of that food will be consumed by working families . The wait for housing through the EHC family shelter is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silicon Valley economy is apparent not just to newcomers who arrive here to seek their fortune but also to anyone who is so unwise as to choose a field of work for love , not money . Schoolteachers , cops , construction workers , nurses , even doctors and lawyers  --  as the tide of wealth rises around them , many are finding it harder to stay afloat . Despite the utopian rhetoric of Silicon Valley boosters like T.J. Rodgers , the CEO of Cypress Semiconductor , who promotes the Valley as a meritocracy where anyone , " regardless of race , color or creed , " can succeed , it 's clear that Silicon Valley is developing into a two-tier society : those who have caught the technological wave and those who are being left behind . This is not simply a phenomenon of class or race or age or the distribution of wealth  --  although those are all important factors . It 's really about the Darwinian nature of unfettered capitalism when it 's operating at warp speed . <p> And while the divide between the haves and have-nots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the country right now , that wo n't last long . " Silicon Valley-style economies are what we can look forward to everywhere , " says Robert H. Frank , an economist at Cornell University who has long studied the increasing gap between the rich and poor . " In this new economy , either you have a lottery ticket or you do n't . And the people who do n't are not happy about it . " <p> Even some of the people who do have lottery tickets are n't happy about it . Bob Metcalfe , an Internet pioneer and co-founder of 3Com , lived in the Valley for twenty-two years  --  until he dropped his kids off at school one day and saw all the other kids being dropped off by " blond au pairs in BMWs . " A few months later , he and his wife sold their house in Woodside and moved to Maine . " I want my kids to grow up in a place that 's not so dominated by envy and greed , " Metcalfe says . Eric Schmidt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the largest software companies in the region , agrees that something has been lost . " The Valley used to be a profoundly democratic place , " he says . " It was all about hot tubs and topless weddings on Mount Tamalpais . Now that 's gone . It 's all about deals and pushing change . It 's all about money . " <p> THE EMERGENCY HOUSING Consortium estimates that about thirty-five percent of the people who stay at the shelter have full-time jobs . When the center opened in 1997 , says EHC communications manager Maury Kendall , " we knew the demand for our services would be high . But what we did n't anticipate was the number of families that would come to us  --  that 's where the screaming demand has been . " EHC got started in the early Eighties with the help of a $50,000 gift of Apple stock from Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak . Since then , the high-tech industry has been intermittently supportive : Adobe Systems donated a courtyard , Apple and Silicon Graphics send over a group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cisco Systems has plans to develop an educational-outreach program there . " We 're grateful for all the help we 've received , " says Barry Del Buono , a former diocesan priest who is now EHC 's executive director , " but given the amount of money in the Valley , there 's much more that could be done . " <p> At times , the EHC shelter feels like little more than a dumping ground for the digital revolution 's wounded and maimed . One afternoon , a woman named Natalie holds out her arms to show me two faint scars on the inside of both wrists . " A razor blade ? " I ask , thinking she had slashed her wrists . " No , a keyboard , " she says . She worked as a customer-service rep for a local telephone company for seven years , until all the pounding caused carpal tunnel syndrome so severe that she needed surgery  --  and was promptly fired from her job . " Now I ca n't use a keyboard , " she says angrily . " Where do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> One night , I wander out to the front desk at 3 A.M. and meet an animated woman named Melondy Spears James . She and her four kids moved to the Valley a few years ago from Richmond , California , because she had heard there were lots of good jobs here and she wanted to get off welfare . Almost immediately , she found a temp job at an IBM chip-manufacturing plant in San Jose , where she made more than ten dollars an hour . Twelve hours a day , four days a week ' she stood in front of a slicing machine , cutting silicon wafers into thin chips . It was brutal , monotonous work . On a good night , she made 190 cuts . Before long she had to wear a back brace to work and a wrap around one leg to keep it from throbbing . Still , it was worth it because she thought she 'd soon be hired permanently , with benefits and vacation time . " Then they decided to send my job down to Guadalajara , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now she 's applying for a job at the Mervyn 's distribution center while working two nights a week at the shelter . <p> At 7 A.M. I watch Kevin Landsdown straighten up his semiprivate cubicle . Landsdown , a tall , soft-spoken man , lives a double life : From nine to five he works at the tree-lined Hewlett-Packard campus in the heart of the Valley , where he helps manage the distribution of new HP products . At night he returns to the shelter , where he 's been living for the past few months . I tell him that most people wo n't understand how a man with a college degree and a good job can end up in a shelter . " Then those people , " he notes , " have never lived in Silicon Valley . " <p> James and Landsdown , like many of the residents of the shelter during my stay this past summer , are black . This is not a coincidence . The fact that blacks and Hispanics are not sharing equally in the Valley 's economic boom is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from generally poor education among blacks and Hispanics to subtle yet pervasive racism . Landsdowh , who grew up on the South Side of Chicago and has worked in Silicon Valley since the mid 1980s , says , " Yes , there are a lot of people of color working here , but most of them are Asians and Indians  --  people the white man has no grudge against . " He believes that " black people are different . When I worked at Silicon Graphics a few years ago , an engineer called me a gorilla . At Amdahl , people called me a nigger  --  not once but five times . " <p> Ugly stuff  --  but is it any worse than what goes on every day in offices all across America ? Last year the San Francisco Chronicle examined the employment records for thirty-three leading Silicon Valley corporations and determined that the staffs at these companies were about four percent black and seven percent Latino . Compare this with the fact that blacks make up eight percent of the labor force in the Bay area , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem . " Everyone here wants to believe the Valley is a perfect place and they are living a perfect life , " says one veteran Silicon Valley real estate agent . " Racism obviously exists , but no one is allowed to talk about it , because to talk about it would be to admit that life here is not some twenty-first-century utopia . " <p> One of the last agricultural areas remaining in the Valley was North First Street , which runs from downtown San Jose out toward the foot of the San Francisco Bay . Today , thanks to San Jose 's new light-rail service , dozens of high-tech companies have sprung up here , including a sprawling new Cisco Systems campus . A single open field is left , and in that field an old white ranch house sits abandoned , surrounded by a chain-link fence  --  in the Valley , this is a sure sign that the bulldozers are coming . A quiet side street runs in front of the house , and on a recent Sunday afternoon , four dilapidated motor homes are parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian attack . Sitting in a lawn chair outside one of them is a middle-aged woman with bright blue eyes and dark hair . Her name is Lu Elaine Johnson , and she 's a student at a nearby chiropractic college . " I live in here because I ca n't afford an apartment , " she tells me . She says that the people in the other trailers are also students and that a few blocks away I can find another street where a half-dozen motor homes are illicitly camped out . " We 're the wandering homeless , " she says . I ask her about the fenced-off field across the street . She explains , accurately , that open land in this area routinely sells for a million dollars or more per acre . " Where does all this money come from ? Is there some printing press up in the hills that I do n't know about ? " <p> Many are asking the same question . Although the class divide in the Valley has never been greater , geographically the gap is shrinking every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the increasingly uncomfortable juxtaposition of two vastly different worlds is palpable . One night , as I ride along with officer Thomas Joy of the Los Altos Police Department , we come upon the home of John Warnock , the CEO of Adobe Systems . It 's an enormous old mansion , the grounds shrouded by hundred-year-old oak trees . Joy , who recently worked a security detail at the house when Warnock hosted a Democratic Party fund-raising dinner , shines his spotlight at the rear of the house . He gushes , " There 's a huge guest house out there and a bandstand and a picnic area . It 's stunning . " We cruise quietly past row after row of sprawling mansions on the lots of what were formerly modest middle-class houses . " This is all Silicon Valley money , " Joy says . Then he adds , " Now let 's look at the other side . " <p> We drive for about ninety seconds , cross El Camino Real and enter the town of Mountain View . Immediately , everything changes . Flimsy four-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hanging out on the corner , stop signs are scrawled with gang graffiti . " I responded to a call here a few weeks ago  --  some domestic trouble , " Joy says , pointing to a white-stucco apartment building . " I walked in the front door , and the floors were covered with mattresses . There must have been nine or ten people crashed out there . Not junkies , either . Guys looking for work . Day laborers , mostly . " <p> In New York or Washington , D.C. , the rich and poor have always lived in close proximity . Not in Silicon Valley . One of the secrets of the Valley 's success is that until recently , it was a balmy paradise of the middle class . I grew up there in the 1970s , during the Cold War , when the Valley 's economy was tied to government spending , not Wall Street . Many of the men in the tract-house neighborhood where I lived worked in the defense industry , building missiles and satellites . But there were also teachers , carpenters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ richer than anyone else . There were always the Hispanic families who had lost their jobs when the canneries went out , but the gap between us and them was not so profound . There were no millionaires , no IPOs . Indeed , had the Valley been rich , the whole PC revolution might never have ignited . " I decided to build my first computer , " Steve Wozniak once told me , " because I could n't afford to go out and buy one . " Of course , computers cost tens of thousands of dollars in those days , but the point remains . If it were n't for the struggling middle class  --  Woz is the son of a mid-level Lockheed engineer , while Steve Jobs , whose adoptive father was a machinist , came from even humbler roots  --  there might be no Macintosh , no Yahoo ! , no Internet . <p> Thanks to the boom , however , and the skyrocketing housing prices , there is no such thing as a middle class in the Valley anymore  --  there 's rich and poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars a year gets you nothing , " says Dan Hingle , 35 , a quality-assurance engineer at a start-up called InterNiche Technologies . Hingle grew up in the Valley and now , despite his $50,000 annual salary , lives in a trailer park . " With $200,000 , you can begin to approach a middle-class life . How many people have jobs that pay $200,000 ? Not many . So people move out of the area , to where they can afford to buy a house , and commute an hour or two to work every day . That 's fine , but then you 're spending three or four hours on the road , and it 's real easy to start hating life . " <p> Many affluent communities , like Aspen or Nantucket , are facing a crisis : The people needed to run the essential services ca n't afford to live there . In Silicon Valley , the problem is multiplied a thousand-fold . " Silicon Valley is in danger of collapsing under the weight of its own prosperity , " wrote Todd Dwyer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recent letter to the San Jose Mercury News . <p> Officer Joy is a case in point . Although he works in Los Altos , he lives in Sonora , a three-hour drive away , in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada . He drives in to Los Altos once a week , stays on his mother 's couch for four days , then drives home to his family . This kind of grueling commute is not unusual . In Los Altos , police officers start at around $40,000 a year  --  on that , it 'd be tough to afford a doghouse in town . Ideally , cops who live where they work are better cops  --  they know the community better , are less like a mercenary force . Of the thirty-three officers who patrol Los Altos , though , only one lives there ; in nearby Los Gatos , forty-two out of forty-four live out of town ; none of the ninety-five officers in Palo Alto is a local resident . Lt. Robert Brennan of the Palo Alto Police Department says , " It 's a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cops . <p> Two years ago , Jennifer Jolliff was offered a job teaching in a Los Gatos public school . The salary was $29,000 , well above what she was making in a small town in central California . So she took the job , moved north and began searching for an apartment . " I always thought it was very important for a teacher to live in the community they teach  --  you can vote on local issues , get to know the families of your students , " Jolliff says . In Los Gatos , an upscale Silicon Valley enclave , Jolliff discovered that her $2,100 monthly check did n't go very far . " I ended up living in a mobile home under an overpass for the next two years , " she says . She eventually moved to a house in the Santa Cruz Mountains , and now , like almost everyone else , she commutes . <p> Los Angeles still leads the nation for the worst commute , but the Valley is closing in fast . It used to be proud of its gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foothills between San Francisco and Los Altos ; but the area 's newest freeways , like Highway 87 , are surrounded by high sound barriers , just like in L.A. Not surprisingly , violence on the highways is increasingly common . In September , a gunman poked his head out through the sunroof of his red sports car and opened fire with a semiautomatic , killing one person and wounding another . A few months earlier , a twenty-year-old woman accidentally cut off another car in traffic . Its driver pulled up beside her and shot her . <p> If you dream of dot-com millions , the pain of life in the Valley is irrelevant . This is the place to meet like-minded Type A marketeers , hammer out a business plan and roll the IPO dice . And you do n't have to be Yahoo ! ' s Jerry Yang to hit it big . Two years ago , Samantha Jordan , 25 , was cleaning horse barns in Michigan . " I thought computers were for geeks and was n't interested in them in the slightest , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved out to California , intending to get a job teaching horseback riding at a stable in the Bay area ; instead she took a job in tech support  --  the bottom rung of the high-tech hierarchy  --  at Excite@Home . Today , thanks to her stock options , she owns a half-million-dollar house and drives a nice convertible . <p> But stories like this , which reinforce our dreams that we , too , might get lucky someday , are the exception not the rule . In fact , the majority of startups in the Valley fail ; for those that do succeed , about eighty-five percent of the stock is owned by the company founders and venture capitalists , leaving only fifteen percent to be split among the employees . At powerhouse companies like Cisco Systems and Microsoft , or overnight sensations like eBay and Yahoo ! , the critical mass of wealth is so great that even lowly cubicle jockeys can get rich . Most companies , however , are not eBay or Cisco , and the majority of young high-tech workers in the Valley are 50K-a-year wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options are worth little or nothing . <p> Still , everyone knows that stock options are the only way most worker bees are going to get ahead in the Valley . " It 's becoming more and more like a casino , " says Michael Neff , a senior Web designer who has been through three start-ups . He now works at a pre-IPO start-up called PublishOne , which is involved in digital-rights management . " So much of what makes a company succeed or fail is beyond your control . All you can do is believe in the people you 're working with and hope you get lucky . " Most people can go through the start-up craziness once , maybe twice . After that , if they have n't hit the jackpot , they 're usually too old ( which , in the Valley , means mid-thirties ) and bitter to try it again . <p> God forbid you have a life : a spouse , a kid , even a dog . To work at a start-up , you have to toss them overboard , at least temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's out of the question . Hoffman , a smart , bouncy , career-minded woman with a twelve-year-old daughter , has worked for the last thirteen years at Panasonic . As a network-systems operator , she makes $46,000 a year . She lives in a mobile home that looks like something you 'd find up-hollow in West Virginia , not in Silicon Valley : rusty metal siding ; plywood steps up to the front door , where her dog , Charlie , is tied up and howling ; her eleven-year-old Nissan Pathfinder , with 154,000 miles , is parked nearby . " I 'd love to go to work for a start-up , " Hoffman says wistfully . " But that means working twelve-hour days and on weekends and for very little salary . What am I supposed to say to my daughter  --  ' I 'll see you in two years ' ? No thanks . " <p> In a way , people like Hoffman have the worst of it here : She has the skills and the technical know-how and the savvy to roll the dice at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So she commutes an hour a day to her corporate job , juggles her daughter 's soccer schedule , shops , cooks and worries about the $1,000 she recently invested in stock on e-Trade . Meanwhile , Mercedes-Benzes zoom around her , and every time she opens the newspaper , she reads about another IPO multimillionaire . " I sometimes think , ' Why not me ? What did they do to deserve it ? Are they somehow a better person than me ? Did they work harder ? ' I do n't think so . They 're just luckier , " Hoffman says . " OK , that 's fine , I can handle that . But to have to have your nose rubbed in it every day  --  it can get to you . " <p> The obvious response to this , of course , is that if you do n't like having your nose rubbed in other people 's money , then leave . Some do , but for many with families , it 's not so easy . <p> Ten years ago , Luis Estrada , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Like everyone else , " he says , " I wanted a better life . " Estrada is a tall man with a gentle voice and large , rough hands . He went to a local high school , speaks excellent English and knew that if he wanted to get anywhere in America , he needed to go to college . But his family had no money for that , so he decided to get a job and save some money . He got hired five years ago as a maintenance worker at Flextronics International , a high-tech manufacturing firm . " When I started , there were about ten people there , and they were all driving jalopies , " says Estrada . " Now the parking lot is full of BMWs . " <p> Estrada 's is a typical Silicon Valley story  --  but , of course , he did n't get any stock and therefore did n't share in that wealth . Now he 's married and has an eight-month-old son , and , in order to make ends meet , he works two jobs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings and weekends planting trees and doing yard work for the local elite . He knows that he 's never going to get ahead in the Valley this way and that what he really needs to do is go back to school and learn about computers . " I do n't want to do this the rest of my life , " he says , pounding a stake in the ground next to a crab-apple tree in a new housing development in south San Jose . " But I do n't see how it 's going to change . I have to work seventy hours a week to pay the rent and provide for my child , and that does n't leave me a lot of time for studying . " <p> I ask him if he ever dreams of becoming a millionaire . <p> At first he does not understand the question . I repeat it . He chuckles . " You kidding ? " <p> As soon as you take the Silver Creek Road exit off the freeway , the signs begin : Enchantment , Jasmine , Silvercrest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life straight ahead . Drive along for a mile or so , up a grassy hillside at the south end of the Valley  --  two years ago , there was nothing but farmland and coyotes here  --  and the road crests at a plateau that 's littered with brand-new million-dollar homes . A million-dollar home is no big deal here , but still , this place is nice . Many of the homes have views of Silicon Valley , which looks like a giant computer chip in the haze below . Most of the new residents are mid-level engineers at Cisco or Hewlett-Packard  --  people who 've had some luck but not enough to get a spread in Woodside , where the venture capitalists and CEOs hang out . <p> Liliana and Peter Townshend live in one of the newest houses in the development  --  " a 3,500-square-foot , sideloading Spanish Provence , " Liliana calls it . Red-tile roof , green shutters . Very nice . And very new . The house was finished only a couple of months ago , and the lot it 's on is still mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the driveway , a few pink poppies waving in the wind , a pair of small Prairie Fire crab-apple trees staked near the sidewalk . It feels like the frontier . <p> Liliana , 27 , is Hispanic . Her parents were both born in Mexico and then moved to California , where her father picked apples . She grew up in a poor section of L.A. , the sixth of seven kids , attended UC Berkeley and then law school at the University of Illinois . Now she 's starting her own e-commerce business , Tuzona.com , which sells electronics and computer equipment to Spanish-speaking people all over the world . Her husband , Peter , 28 , grew up in West L.A. , the son of a UCLA physics professor . He got a law degree from Berkeley 's Boalt Hall and is now a venture-capital lawyer at Heller Ehrman White &; McAuliffe , one of the top law firms in the Valley . If anyone has crossed over the digital divide , it 's the Townshends . <p> But when you step inside their house , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a black leather couch in the den that they picked up at a yard sale ; the dining room is completely empty ; the living room has a couple of chairs and a simple coffee table ; in the kitchen , they eat off an old wooden table that belonged to Peter 's grandmother . Their only indulgences are electronic : a big-screen Mitsubishi in the TV room upstairs and a Sony Wega thirty-two-inch flatscreen TV downstairs . And there are two cats , Jimmy and Sierra . Otherwise , the house is empty . <p> This is how the rich poor people or the poor rich people  --  the people who are straddling the line between those who have made it and those who have not  --  live in Silicon Valley . Peter makes $120,000 a year at his law firm ; Liliana , at the moment , makes zip . They have a $3,600-a-month house payment , plus a second mortgage ( to Peter 's parents ) for $90,000 . Liliana still owes $60,000 in student loans , and they have $18,000 of debt on their credit cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $6,000 . Liliana shops for food at Costco ; when she 's down in L.A. visiting her family , she loads her Ford Explorer up with food for the drive home , because groceries are cheaper down there . " I feel like the poorest of the poor in Silicon Valley , " Liliana says . <p> And yet she will sometimes say to Peter , as she did the other night after she saw a BMW commercial on TV : " Why do n't you buy me a BMW ? I 've always wanted a BMW , and they 're only $40,000 . " Or she 'll see an ad for a Toyota and think , " Why do n't we buy a couple of them ? They 're only $20,000 each . " She says things like this because , like anyone who travels at the edge of the big money in the Valley , she and her husband are constantly bombarded with unreal numbers : Bill Gates is worth $90 billion , Amazon 's Jeff Bezos is worth $7.8 billion , Jerry Yang is worth $3.7 billion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked into my office and there was $2 million worth of personal checks from clients sitting on my chair , " says Peter . " When money like that is flying all around you , you lose perspective . " <p> The Townshends , of course , are trying to get their share . They bought this house in November 1998 , before it was even built , for $720,000 , because they knew real estate is appreciating like crazy in the Valley . In September 1999 , Peter guesses he could sell it for $920,000 . If Liliana can get investors interested in Tuzona.com , maybe that will take off . Or if not , maybe Peter will make the leap to become an in-house lawyer for one of the start-ups he counsels every day . He already passed up that chance a couple of years ago , with a strange company that was going to auction stuff on the Web . " I thought it was a really dumb idea , " he says . Peter drafted the initial documents for the company , then turned the work over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associate ended up joining the company , which was named eBay , and now , just a year after it went public , that junior associate is worth $25 million , while the founder of the company , Pierre Omidyar , is worth $4.9 billion . How does it feel to have missed out on the start-up of the decade ? Peter shrugs : " You ca n't take it seriously . " <p> And yet it 's clear that Peter does take it seriously . He and Liliana both want to hit escape velocity  --  that blissful state when you have enough money to escape the humdrum cares of daily life , like mortgages and jobs and worries about where your kids will go to school  --  before the Internet bubble bursts . Like many others who live on the edge in the Valley , Liliana and Peter have made the calculation that if they can score now , whatever pains they 've suffered will be worth it . So Peter regularly works twelve- to fifteen-hour days , five days a week . He 's already been hospitalized twice for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wakes up at 3 A.M. sobbing , afraid that Tuzona.com wo n't fly and that all the money  --  about $25,000 so far  --  they 've poured into it will be wasted . Peter 's back aches , his neck aches , his belly hangs a little farther over his belt than he 'd like , and his eyes have that permanent glaze of a person who has been pulling all-nighters so long that he can no longer tell whether the sun is going up or coming down . He misses his family . " I can count on my fingers the number of times I 'll get to see my mother and father before they die , " he says . Liliana complains that their marriage is suffering ; they fight more than they should because they never see each other , or because when he comes home at night , she 's sometimes too busy to fix him dinner . " But we 're going to make it , " Liliana says . " Nothing is going to stop us . " <p> The brutality of the Silicon Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yuppie scum " can be found scrawled on walls in San Francisco , and local newspapers like the San Jose Mercury News have tempered their boosterish spirit and started to examine the costs of explosive prosperity . At a recent fund-raiser at the home of Novell CEO Eric Schmidt , President Clinton challenged a group of high-tech execs not to forget those left behind . " This is something you should all ponder , " he warned the crowd . " Not everyone is participating in this economic growth . " <p> According to the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group , the advocacy arm of 150 of the Valley 's major employers , the hardships of life in the area will only get worse in the future . By 2010 , the Valley 's population is projected to grow by 176,000 to 2.6 million , putting more strain on the region 's infrastructure  --  roads , housing , schools , hospitals . " It is absolutely critical that we face these problems head-on , " says Carl Guardino , president of the group . " Otherwise the Valley will cease to function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to resolve the inequities in the new economy are motivated by enlightened self-interest not moral outrage . There 's no such thing as moral outrage in Silicon Valley : There are only various degrees of problem solving . At its worst , this leads to the common assertion that , " Yes , the Valley has a problem , but I 'm too busy to worry about it . " At its best , it leads to a faith in the elitist idea that smart people should find a way to help the less-smart people help themselves . Recently there has been an increased interest in applying venture-capital ideas to philanthropic causes . The Entrepreneurs ' Foundation , for example , created by longtime venture capitalist Gib Myers , provides start-up funding to nonprofit organizations . It 's a good idea , except that it treats the human condition like a vast e-commerce site , where all our problems can be charted out on a white board , with arrows and stars and efficiency charts , and nobody actually has to get down in the trenches and get his hands dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brainpower of Silicon Valley should not be underestimated . And perhaps the benefits of our turbocharged economy  --  a low unemployment rate , a soaring Dow , new technology that is speeding information along and saving lives  --  outweigh the drawbacks . Maybe the ugly truth about the new economy is that for some to succeed , others must be left behind . <p> So far , the losers have gone quietly . But as I drive down Silver Creek Road one afternoon , past a group of Mexican laborers in the front yard of another million-dollar mansion , I 'm reminded of my visit a few days earlier with Donald Howard , a broad-shouldered , blue-eyed construction worker . Howard has a ghoulish skeleton brandishing a shotgun tattooed on one bicep and women entwined in roses tattooed on the other . When I met him , he was building retaining walls in a yard across the street from the house where John Steinbeck once lived . It 's a fitting irony that Steinbeck wrote The Grapes of Wrath , his powerful novel about migrant workers during the 1930s , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Howard tells me he makes sixteen dollars an hour : no union , no benefits . It 's enough to allow him to rent a bedroom in a nice condo in Santa Clara , to keep his 1986 Cadillac running and to keep up with child-support payments . But that 's about it . <p> I ask Howard whether he feels any anger about the fact that so many people are getting rich and he 's not . " Not really , " he shrugs . Howard believes that as long as the economy keeps going strong , no one 's going to complain too loudly . " But if the bubble bursts , " he says , leaning on his shovel , " maybe people will feel differently . They might start to think about what 's fair and what 's not fair . So far we have n't had any situations like they have in South America , where the poor people kidnap the children of rich people and hold them for ransom . But you know , " he says gently , looking out over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens in a place where things get too far out of balance , " He says this not as a threat but as a simple statement of fact . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : THAD WINGATE Although he takes home $2,400 a month , the courier had to live in a homeless shelter in San Jose .
