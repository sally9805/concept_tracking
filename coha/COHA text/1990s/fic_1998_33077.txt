Good day at the track , damn near swept the card . Yet it gets boring out there , even when you 're winning . It 's the 30 minute wait between races , your life leaking out into space . The people look gray out there , walked through . And I 'm there with them . But where else could I go ? An Art Museum ? Imagine staying home all day and playing at writer ? I could wear a little scarf . I remember this poet who used to come by on the bum . Buttons off his shirt , puke on his pants , hair in eyes , shoelaces undone , but he had this long scarf which he kept very clean . That signaled that he was a poet . His writing ? Well , forget it .... Came in , swam in the pool , then went to the spa . My soul is in danger . Always has been . Was sitting on the couch with Linda , the good dark night descending , when there was a knock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , Hank ... " I walked to the door , barefooted , in my robe . A young blond guy , a young fat girl and a medium sized girl . " They want your autograph ... " " I dorft see people , " I told them . " We just want your autograph , " said the blond guy , " then we promise never to come back . " Then he started giggling , and holding his head . Thegirls just stared . " But none of you have a pen or even a piece of paper , " I said . " Oh , " said the blond kid , taking his hands from his head , " We 'll come back again with a book ! Maybe at a more proper time ... " The bathrobe . The bare feet . Maybe the kid thought I was eccentric . Maybe I was . " Do n't come in the morning , " I told them . I saw them begin to walk off and I closed the door ... Now I 'm up here writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard with them or they 'll swarm you . I 've had some horrible experiences blocking that door . So many of them think that somehow you 'll invite them in and drink with them all night . I prefer to drink alone . A writer owes nothing except to his writing . He owes nothing to the reader except the availability of the printed page . And worse , many of the doorknockers are not even readers . They 've just heard something . The best reader and the best human is the one who rewards me with his or her absence . Slow at the track today , my damned life dangling on the hook . I am there every day . I do n't see anybody else out there every day except the employees . I probably have some malady . Saroyan lost his ass at the track , Fante at poker , Dostoevsky at the wheel . And it 's really not a matter of the money unless you run out of it . I had a gambler friend once who said , " I dorft care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamble . " I have more respect for money . I 've had very little of it most of my life . I know what a park bench is , and the landlord 's knock . There are only two things wrong with money : too much or too little . I suppose there 's always something out there we want to torment ourselves with . And at the track you get the feel of the other people , the desperate darkness , and how easy they toss it in and quit . The racetrack crowd is the world brought down to size , life grinding against death and losing . Nobody wins finally , we are just seeking a reprieve , a moment out of the glare . ( Shit , the lighted end of my cigarette just hit one of my fingers as I was musing on this purposelessness . That woke me up , brought me out of this Sartre state ! ) Hell , we need humor , we need to laugh . I used to laugh more , I used to do everything more , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , the older I get the more I write , dancing with death . Good show . And I think the stuff is all right . One day they 'll say , " Bukowski is dead , " and then I will be truly discovered and hung from stinking bright lampposts . So what ? Immortality is the stupid invention of the living . You see what the racetrack does ? It makes the lines roll . Lightning and luck . The last bluebird singing . Anything I say sounds fine because I gamble when I write . Too many are too careful . They study , they teach and they fail . Convention strips them of their fire . I feel better now , up here on this second floor with the Macintosh . My pal . And Mahler is on the radio , he glides with such ease , taking big chances , one needs that sometimes . Then he sends in the long power rises . Thank you , Mahler , I borrow from you and I can never pay you back . I smoke too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , it just keeps coming and I call for more and it arrives and mixes with Mahler . Sometimes I deliberately Stop myself . I say , wait a moment , go to sleep or look at Your 9 cats or sit with your wife on the couch . You 're either at the track or with the Macintosh . And then I stop , Put on the brakes , park the damned thing . Some people have written that my writing has helped them go on . It has helped me too . The writing , the horses , the 9 cats . There 's a small balcony here , the door is open and I call see the lights of the cars on the Harbor Freeway south , they never stop , that roll of lights , on and on . All those people . What are they doing ? What are they thinking ? We 're all going to die , all of us , what a circus ! That alone should make us love each other but it does nt . We are terrOrized and flattened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep it going , Mahler ! You 've made this a wondrous night . Do n't stop , you son-of-a-bitch ! Do n't stop !
