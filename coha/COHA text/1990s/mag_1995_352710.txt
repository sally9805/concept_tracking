' T was right around Christmas , and all through the house , not a creature was stirring  --  except George Molnar and his mouse . Molnar , president of Midwest Business Systems , a Southfield , Michigan , computer outlet , had just brought home a top-of-the-line IBM clone  --  one of those multimedia wonders that come preloaded with dozens of software titles and bedecked with a CD-ROM drive , stereo speakers and a way-too-big monitor . The machine was " a Cadillac , " says Molnar , except for one thing : it was having trouble getting started . Molnar sat there , mouse in hand , pointing and clicking , trying to use his new library of 45 software programs . Only a dozen or so actually ran . <P> Molnar 's surprise and disappointment were shared by perhaps hundreds of thousands of other buyers this Christmas , who purchased home computers only to discover that the accursed things did n't work  --  or at least did n't work well . While 1994 was a record breaker for the computer industry ( 18.4 million PCs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1995 wo n't be remembered as the Year of the Returns . <P> According to Richard Zwetchkenbaum , research director at International Data Corp. , 5.8 million personal computers were shipped between October and New Year 's  --  the largest volume ever . Significantly , more than 40% of those machines went to home users . This was the year when millions of Americans  --  having resisted the computer industry 's blandishments for more than a decade  --  finally made the plunge . And that may spell big changes for the industry . In the past , according to Liz Buyer , an analyst at T. Rowe Price , people put PCs in their dens primarily so they could bring work home ; now they seem to be buying computers as they buy TVs  --  for their entertainment value . <P> That puts a burden on computer manufacturers to make machines that are as easy to use as TVs . Experts say that even in a good year , as many as 10% of computers sold will be returned to stores by disgruntled customers . Judging by the lines at return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Returns will be a big deal for the first quarter , " says Buyer , who points out that most of the big software companies have set aside twice as much cash as they usually do to offset returns . <P> They 'd better , because there are some angry people out there . Like the Ippolitos , a Brooklyn family who were in line  --  not online  --  at a J &R; Computer World store last week , waiting to return a piece of software that would n't work . The family owns two late-model computers , IBM clones , so that both Nick , 14 , and Zachary , 11 , will always have a machine for marauding and avenging . A few weeks ago , their father bought them the CD-ROM game Front Page Sports Baseball ' 94 , by Sierra Online . The game , which the boys opened Christmas Eve , could n't be installed properly . Nick says he called Sierra 's hot line " for five hours , once every five minutes " and kept getting a busy signal . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the computer , they returned the game .
