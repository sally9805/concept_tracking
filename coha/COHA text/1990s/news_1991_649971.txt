##@x <p> What is really at stake in the nomination of Judge Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court ? While any candidate nominated to replace Justice Thurgood Marshall would likely accelerate the Court 's rightward trend , Judge Thomas 's adherence to " natural law " as a judicial philosophy could take the Court in an even more troubling direction . <p> Most conservatives criticize the judiciary for expanding its powers , " creating " rights rather than " interpreting " the Constitution . These critics talk of returning issues like abortion to democratically elected and politically accountable bodies . <p> Clarence Thomas , judging from his speeches and scholarly writings , seems instead to believe judges should enforce the Founders ' natural law philosophy  --  the inalienable rights " given man by his Creator "  --  which he maintains is revealed most completely in the Declaration of Independence . He is the first Supreme Court nominee in 50 years to maintain that natural law should be readily consulted in constitutional interpretation . <p> When a child born today reaches voting age , Judge Thomas will be 61 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now . By then , the nation will face many new issues  --  new reproductive technologies , computer privacy , genetic engineering . <p> Might a Justice Thomas some day provide a fifth vote to hold that Congress and the states may not respond with measures contrary to natural law , as construed by the justices on the basis of their understanding of the rights " given to man by his Creator ? " Whether that understanding coincides with specific religious teachings matters less than how it affects legislative power and personal liberty . <p> Consider abortion . Judge Thomas has called even the right of married couples to use birth control  --  recognized by the Court 26 years ago in Griswold v. Connecticut  --  an " invention . " Unfortunately , he seems likely to help overturn Roe v. Wade . <p> But whether Roe v. Wade is overruled is only half the question . No less important is the kind of regime that would follow . The Court in a post-Roe world would probably debate whether the Constitution permitted states to ban the French abortion drug RU-486 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape exceptions . <p> In these debates , a Justice Thomas , for whom the right to privacy may seem anathema , might seek to replace Roe not with a system that strengthens states ' rights , but with a decree that abortion is murder and that its practice or counseling can not be permitted by any state . <p> Judge Thomas has already dismissed talk of states ' rights as a " constitutional sideshow . " He also endorsed Lewis Lehrman 's 1987 American Spectator article , which argued that because abortion violates the " right to life " guaranteed by the law of God in the Declaration of Independence , the Constitution can not tolerate even a neutral stance on the issue . To Judge Thomas , that extraordinary theological argument was a " splendid example of applying natural law " to define the " right to life " secured by the Declaration . <p> Or consider Judge Thomas 's insistence that " economic liberties are a vital part of the rights protected by constitutional government . " To be sure , judges today understand that certain economic rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is taken for public use , are constitutionally guaranteed . <p> But the last time a Supreme Court majority invoked natural rights theories , some 80 years ago , the Court held that the Constitution protects such economic rights as the " liberty " of employers to conduct business free of health and safety regulations and minimum wage laws . <p> Libertarians , though , can take little solace : Natural law has most often been cited to justify moralistic intrusions on personal choice  --  as illustrated by Chief Justice Warren E. Burger 's appeal to " Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards " in Bowers v. Hardwick , a 1986 case condemning oral and anal sex between consenting adults . <p> And , perhaps echoing the Declaration 's language that " all men are created equal , " the Court 120 years ago relied on the law of " nature " and " the law of the Creator " to deny a woman the right to practice law , deeming it the " paramount destiny and mission of woman . . . to fulfill the noble and benign offices of wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confirm Judge Thomas , they should explore the implications of his views about natural law as the lodestar of constitutional interpretation . With the power of Congress and of every state and local legislature hanging in the balance , the Senate can not avoid sharing the responsibility for the fate of self-government in the U.S. @@649971 Leah <p> Kenny , Stop , Pleeeease ! Kennnnyyy ! " I cried for my life . It was n't even about the baby anymore because I was sure it was dead . There was no way it could have withstood the blows Kenny delivered directly to my stomach . Not to mention his dragging me around on the concrete floors . My poor baby was gone . I was feeling weaker with each punch . I was losing consciousness , and I realized Kenny was trying to kill me . <p> " Please , Kenny , do n't kill me , " I said with what little energy I had . " Please . " <p> Kenny turned me over on my back and straddled my neck and upper chest . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blurry to me . In fact , everything was blurry . I turned to my right and the door to one of the guest bedrooms was opened . The furniture in it looked like it was floating . All of the colors from the sage-colored paint on the walls to the olive-green silk drapes on the windows and the multicolored Oriental rugs on the hardwood floors blended together , forming one big rainbow cloud . When I looked up at the recessed lights that lined the ceiling in our hallway , I felt nauseous . I wanted to close my eyes to avoid the dizzy feeling I had , but I was afraid if I did I would die . So I fought with all my might to keep my eyelids from drooping . And just as I was beginning to give up on trying to stay alive , I felt Kenny 's weight lift off me and heard him walking away from me and down the stairs . I felt a sense of relief , as I believed he was finished with me . <p> I had a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the position I was in , and I wondered if it was worth it . Was it really worth my life ? I wished I could turn back the hands of time , but I could n't , and before I wasted any more time pitying myself , I needed to focus on what I could do to get help . <p> Relief was short-lived . As I lay there on the cold hardwood floor , clinging to consciousness , I could faintly hear Kenny 's footsteps once again on the steps . <p> I opened my eyes as much as my strength would allow and saw Kenny pouring what I figured was gasoline on every step as he walked backward down our spiral staircase . I wanted to protest , to try to plead for my life , but I had no energy at all to do or say anything . I felt completely paralyzed , helpless , as good as dead . <p> " This 'll teach you to wear a wire on me , bitch ! " Kenny yelled . <p> Then I heard the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps and , seconds later , a loud poof . A panic came over me . My mind was telling me to get up and run , but my body would n't move . I thought about my mom and how she 'd tried to tell me time and time again to leave Kenny alone . Had I listened to her , I would not have been preparing to meet my death . I thought about Nasir and wondered what he would say and how he would feel once he found out that I was gone . I wished I could have had one last moment with him . Even if it was just to say good-bye . My life nearing its end , I began to muffle the Twenty-third Psalm . <p> " The Lord is my shepherd ; I shall not want . He maketh me to lie down in green pastures : he leadeth me beside the still waters . He restoreth my soul : he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name 's sake . Yea , though I walk through the valley of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art with me ; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me . Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies : thou anointest my head with oil ; my cup runneth over . Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life , and I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever . " <p> I closed my eyes . I thought about the date : May 30 , 2008 . So my tombstone would read Leah Cecily Nicole Baker , July 17 , 1983 , to May 30 , 2008 . Then I had second thoughts . I 'm not ready to die and especially not like this . I want to fight . I want to fight badly . But I ca n't . Please , God , spare my life . Please , God , intervene . Please do n't let today be my last . <p> Copyright 2009 by Meosha Coleman <br> Continues ...
