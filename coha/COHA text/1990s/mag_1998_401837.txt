BEFORE DAWN , FLOCKS OF GEESE ROSE FROM ALUM CREEK AND HOOVER RESERVOIRS , JUST NORTH OF THE I-470 BELTWAY CIRCLING COLUMBUS , OHIO . ACROSS THE FARM COUNTRY SURROUNDING THE SUBURB OF WESTERVILLE , SMALL FAMILY GROUPS OF SIX AND EIGHT BIRDS LIFTED OFF PONDS , WATER HAZARDS , AND QUARRIES . THE GEESE CAME FROM ALL POINTS OF THE COMPASS , HOMING IN ON THE WHEATFIELD WHERE WE LAY WAITING ON OUR BACKS IN THE STUBBLE , PEEKING OUT FROM UNDERNEATH MAGNUM DECOY SHELLS . WITH THE WARM , HUMID AIR DEAD CALM , THE FLOCKS DID N'T HAVE TO SWING DOWNWIND ON THEIR FINAL APPROACH ; THEY JUST DROPPED THEIR FEET AND LANDED ANYWHERE-SOME IN FRONT OF US , SOME BEHIND , OTHERS ANGLING IN FROM THE SIDES . We flipped the shells aside and lurched up to shoot , our shotguns turning the goose songs into the " 1812 Overture . " For the next half hour , flock after flock wheeled over the treetops at the field 's edge and made a beeline for the decoys . As waterfowlers say : The geese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven , the limit was four apiece , and guide Tom Barnett did the math . " Stop ! We 're done , " he shouted just as the sun barely cracked above the treeline After the handshakes and backslaps , we contemplated a long , hot morning of cleaning geese . Said Barnett , who , along with partners Tim Wing and Andy Boystel , makes up fledgling Take A Gander Outfitters : " We never saw a Canada goose around Columbus while we were growing up . Our fathers thought we were crazy to start a goose-guiding business . We had to take our dads hunting to show them what we were talking about . " Barnett and company are n't the only ones talking about resident Canadas these days ; to borrow a phrase from Broadway , " Geese Is the Word " among a growing number of waterfowlers across the country in the month of September . THE RESIDENT CANADA BOOM TRAP-AND-TRANSFER EFFORTS TO RESTORE RESIDENT GIANT CANADAS ACROSS THE United States began in the 1960s . Now the wildly successful programs are slowing to a halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's getting harder and harder to find any place that does n't already have too many geese . In an effort to curb growing resident flocks , Michigan held the first September Canada season in 1986 . The year after Michigan 's first six-day , two-bird-limit September season in 1986 , Illinois and Minnesota added early seasons . The combined bag for all three states during the 1987 season totaled 22,000 birds . Ten years later , September hunters in 30 states took 419,000 geese . Photograph Giant Canada geese have become so widespread that many landowners have come to think of them as pests . For hunters , they 're an opportunity . // Early Canada season is n't just a warm-up for the fall , either . In many places , September giants have become the Main Event . States such as Ohio and Michigan record higher harvests in September than they do during the traditional fall goose season . Moreover , early seasons allow hunters to take locally grown geese before migratory flights arrive from Canada . Although local birds are booming , some northern populations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Service that their early seasons are n't taking migrant birds , they can justify early seasons up to 15 days long with high daily limits . Special late-winter goose seasons represent the flipside of the shirtsleeve-weather hunts of September . Several states schedule hunts to take place after the migratory flocks have sensibly departed for southern climes . These late seasons target resident birds that often remain in an area year-round , no matter how cold the temperatures . Only the hardy need apply . Lying in a snowy field in the frozen north truly defines the word cold . Said one Minnesota hunter , " It 's like ice fishing without a shack . " For Atlantic Flyway hunters , resident Canadas have been the only game in town since the regular goose seasons were closed in 1995 ( see page 36 ) . As a result , many waterfowlers now live a curiously split existence , sweating through September hunts , sitting out the traditional fall season , then returning to the field to shiver through the winter . For hunters in the rest of the country , early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them goose season runs all fall , from September well into the depths of winter . EARLY BIRDS EARLY SEASONS ARE OFTEN CALLED " nuisance " seasons , but an extra two weeks of September hunting is no nuisance to a whole new generation of waterfowlers climbing the goose-hunter 's learning curve . A few years ago , golf course manager Keith Kresina of Columbus tired of trying to chase geese off his greens and out of his water hazards . He delayed some early tee times and began granting access to careful hunters . One morning Kresina heard a shot and looked up to see a goose fold high over a pond . " I said to myself , that looks like fun . I could do that , " he recalls . Kresina bought decoys , a license , and a shotgun , and became a hunter . While newcomers flock to early goose hunting , some diehard traditionalists disapprove . High four- and five-goose limits demean a majestic bird , they claim , and early geese are too easy . Those who believe waterfowling is meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mix . Yet for every unconvinced purist , there 's a new convert . " Up here we do n't have a dove season . We look forward to September goose hunting all summer , " said one Minnesota hunter . Added another , " Anytime you have a season that 's warm enough to take a kid hunting and give him the opportunity to bag waterfowling 's greatest trophy , I 'm all for it . " As a Midwesterner raised to equate waterfowling with numb toes and chattering teeth , I had my reservations about early-season goose hunting . The only way to find out was to pack my bug dope and fly to Ohio last September . HUNTING THE GIANTS DESPITE THE HEAT , THERE 'S LOTS TO LIKE ABOUT EARLY CANADA HUNTING . RESIDENT geese scatter across the landscape in family groups early in the season , taking whatever refuge they can : ponds , park lakes , water hazards , quarries , rivers , wetlands . Since early-season hunting rarely centers around large concentrations of geese , prime fields are n't tied up by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no firing lines crowded with skybusters in September . By and large , September Canada hunting remains a low-key , inexpensive , Everyman 's pursuit . All you need to spend is a couple hundred dollars for decoys and time spinning the odometer . Hunters scout late in the afternoon for concentrations of geese feeding in alfalfa , pastures , cut corn , or wheat stubble , but they also know that even one family group of half a dozen birds is enough to give them some shooting . Where geese feed in the afternoon , nine times out of ten they 'll be back first thing in the morning . Get there before the geese do , set out two or three dozen decoys , pour the coffee , and wait for the birds to arrive . Photograph TAKE A GANDER OUTFITTERS ( Dept .

Often , hunters will have one big shoot early in the season . Immediately thereafter , their naive geese turn wary and scarce . The day after the wheatfield shootout I traveled southeast of Columbus to hunt with Andy Hogle of Gunner 's Guide Service . Hogle told me there 's more nuance than " nuisance " to hunting early geese . " People see these birds every day and think they must not be challenging to hunt , but the geese spend the whole year here , and they know where everything is , " he said . " They can tell when anything 's out of place . I 'd much rather hunt new migrants that do n't know the area as well . " Hogle 's spread numbered three dozen decoys , although later in the fall , when the migration arrives , he 'll deploy as many as 10 or 15 dozen . The morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide , flat X , providing three landing zones for the incoming geese . Four of us spread out in a line at 5-yard intervals at the crux of the X and lay still among the decoys . Both for mobility and because it makes hunting permission easier to obtain , Hogle , like many modern goose hunters , does n't dig pits but dons full camo and hides among the decoys . Waiting for the geese on a bed of soft alfalfa , I ignored a buzzing mosquito and took a nap . Even on a slow day , I decided , this early goose hunting was n't half bad . I woke to the sound of Hogle 's call and looked over to see him ritching a goose flag on a crappie rod to mesmerizing , lifelike effect . But the flock he 'd spotted was n't buying . Even the supposedly vulnerable singles proved extra-cautious that day . Late in the morning , however , Hogle and partner , Jeff Moore , enticed a lone goose into the decoys ; half an hour later , we picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUNTING FINALLY , HOGLE AND MOORE WORKED A SMALL FLOCK THAT SWUNG PAST TO OUR right in sure gun range . We sat up to shoot and saw that the geese had put themselves bet veen us and a line of new houses several hundred yards away on the other side of the road bordering the field . We held our fire . Hogle shrugged as the geese departed ; for him , as for many hunters , setting up near houses and passing up shots is simply an unavoidable part of modern goose hunting ; so is occasionally explaining himself to the local constabulary . " Once , " he said , " a day-care center over half a mile away called the police on us . I showed them on my map that we were out of city limits , had written permission to hunt , were a safe distance from the center , and were n't even shooting in their direction . They left us alone after that . " Yet for every nonhunter who fears the sight of camouflage and the rumble of 10 gauges , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbus call Canadas " corn buzzards " ; the golfers , much worse names than that . Increasingly , landowners are likely to grant permission with an angry " Kill ' em all . " As hunters , we 're caught in the middle . Everyone likes to feel welcome , but who wants to be the Orkin Man ? We 're waterfowlers , not exterminators , and a 14-pound goose is a prize , not a pest . Giant Canadas deserve our utmost respect and , frankly , our gratitude for being tough and tolerant enough to come back and give us a second chance to hear their music . As the big geese become more widespread , the song of the Canada may no longer be the true call of the wild it was for hunters a generation ago . Modern Canadas sing a song of resilience and adaptability . That tune may not strike a pleasing resonance in every ear , but no one can appreciate the song of the giant Canada more than the hunter with a call who hopes to play along in the chorus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turn to " The Only Game in Town " on page 36. // <p>                     @x In the twilight of my life , I began to question if my childhood was a time of almost absurd languor , or if the violence that would strike us later had lurked there all along . I revisited certain of these memories , determined to find the hidden vein of savagery within them : the sticky hand , the scattered nuts , the gap- toothed girl grasping a firecracker , a cap floating on the Seine , flayed legs swinging between a pair of crutches , the tailor and his mouthful of pins . Some of these were immediately ominous , while others only later revealed themselves as such . However , whether or not another boy living my life would agree , I can not say . <br> Of the humble beginnings from which my father built his fame , I knew only a few details . My grandfather , Abraham Berenzon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store . He sold tinctures , oil , canvases , palettes and palette knives , miniver brushes made from squirrel fur , purple- labeled bottles of turpentine , and easels , which my father described as stacked like a pile of bones . The shop was wedged between a cobbler 's and a dressmaker 's . Artists paid in paintings when they could not pay their bills . And as Renoir , Pissarro , and Courbet were far better with paint than with money , the family built up a collection . <br> When the value of a painting exceeded the price of its paint , Abraham sold it and invested the money with the Count Monses de Camondo , a Jew from Istanbul with an Italian title and a counting-house that he named the Bank of Constantinople . Both men loved art , and they were fast friends . By 1900 , Abraham could purchase an apartment on rue Lafitte , near Notre- Dame-de-Lorette , in a neighborhood known as the Florence of Paris . Soon afterward , Monses de Camondo recommended that my grandfather invest in the railroads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spoils of steel , steam , and iron , and my grandfather did not have to sell any more of his paintings . <br> As a teenager , I often passed by rue Lafitte and imagined the family home as it had once been , as my father had described it : each picture <br> on the grand salon 's walls opening like a window  --  onto a wintry landscape , a tilted table with rolling apples , a ballet studio blooming with turquoise tulle . The salon 's chandelier shone onto the street through windows which , as was the case across the Continent , were made from high- quality crystal . On sunny afternoons , Grandfather 's gallery was so ablaze with prismatic light that schoolchildren returning home for lunch thought they saw angels fluttering down rue Lafitte . They reported their sightings to the choirmaster at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette . When he could no longer bear to tell any more youngsters that they had not seen angels but just rainbows , and from a Jew 's house no less , the choirmaster hinted to some older boys that perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> At least that was how my father explained the attack on his childhood home in July of 1906 . Then again , Dreyfus had just been exonerated , <br> and there were many such outbursts across Paris . Abraham had followed the trial closely , nearly sleepless until the Jewish captain 's verdict was announced . Two days later , hoping to spare a dog that ran into the road , he drove his open- roofed Delage into an arbor of pollarded trees on avenue de Breteuil . My sixteen- year- old father , Daniel , was pinned between the tree trunk and the crushed hood as <br> Abraham expired beside him . From then on , my father walked with a limp , which eight years later exempted him from service in the Great War . So whether he was lucky or unlucky , I could not exactly say . <br> In 1917 , my father purchased the building at 21 , rue de La BoTtie , after my mother Eva agreed to marry him . For this young Polish beauty , whom he hardly knew , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighborhood known for its tolerance of the creative temperament . Yes , as if in anticipation of the utter bleakness that would eventually follow , that block was home not only to my father the collector and my mother the virtuoso pianist , but also to a choreographer renowned for his collaboration with Diaghilev ; the Hungarian trumpeter most preferred by European conductors to perform the second of the Brandenburg Concertos ; a sculptor known for his works in bronze and his clamorous machines ; and , three years later , though without the same fanfare , me . <br> From the well of my early childhood , only one half- lit event emerges : I am in the forest and a small girl shares a sweet bag of nuts with me . We dance on the mossy floor , and she holds my sticky fist in her own . Until late in my life , I supposed that the little girl in the white dress had been a dream , invented sometime in the crepuscular years before my seventh birthday . I remembered nothing at all before 1927 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit brighter than day . This absence of memory was natural , I imagined . I had no siblings with whom to compare my experience and was loath to press others into discussing my youth . <br> Unlike his own father , mine maintained no particular attachments to the paintings that found their way into his possession upon Abraham 's death . Father sold this collection as the first exhibition of the Daniel Berenzon Gallery in the early 1920s . He explained that , at the time , he had been under the influence of the German philosopher Goethe . " Remember the Theory of Colors , Max , " he said , as he paced the gallery . " When you stare steadfastly at an object , and then it is taken away , the spectrum of another color rises to your mind 's eye . This second image now belongs to the mind . The object 's absence or presence is irrelevant . They 're all up here "  --  he tapped his head  --  " so why worry about them out there ? " He gestured to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a museum of the mind . " <br> And for him this was true . To hear my father describe the paintings he had sold  --  which I thought of as lost  --  was as if their watery images , quivering and illuminated , were projected on the dark walls of the gallery from a slide carousel . These pictures possessed a certain patina  --  of regret , of time , of absence , of value  --  which lent my father 's descriptions a deeper beauty than I had been able to see when the paintings hung before me . <br> Indeed , my father was among a tiny group , the heirs to the patron spirit of Catherine de MTdicis and the savoir faire of Duveen or Vollard , whose genius was not in the handling of paint itself , but in the handling of men who painted . They encouraged the artists ' outrageous experiments so that they could paint without fear of financial ruin . They were not just rug merchants and moneymen . They were as devoted as monks to the beauty of their illuminated manuscripts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments . And I believed <br> him . <br> Pablo Picasso was my father 's most famous artist , and he too came to live on rue de La BoTtie , at number 23 . When my father passed below on the street , Picasso would stand in the window and hold up canvases for my father 's approval , and approve he always did . Father encouraged the Spaniard 's experiments , understanding that Picasso 's genius resided not in a single style but in his ability to reinvent himself . He was , Father said , our Fountain of Youth . Since Monsieur Picasso 's art would never grow decrepit or stale , neither would Father and neither would their glorious world of paint . Yet Father kept not a single Picasso in our family collection ; what hung over our dinner table would likely be sold the next week . Our walls were never bare , nor were they familiar . " We 're trying to give what we have away , " Father said . Though he hardly gave the paintings away , I wondered , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my earliest years , each night before Father locked the doors to the art gallery , I was called downstairs from my bedroom and , with my eyes closed , was told the name of a past exhibition and made to recite each painting 's artist , title , and composition : a Morisot Woman in White looking like an angel with the dress slipping from her shoulder ; the Vuillard odalisque NudeHiding Her Face from 1904 ; an iridescent 1910 Bonnard , Breakfast , of woman , jam , and toast . <br> After we reviewed the present exhibition , we would recollect past ones , of Sisley and Monet 's winter scenes ; Toulouse-Lautrec 's portraits on cardboard with low- grade paint ; the occasion on which Father had furnished the exhibition rooms with rococo settees and ormolu chiffoniers and then hung above them the most wild drawings by Braque , Mir= , Gris , and Ernst , so as to indicate that modern art could indeed decorate a home . Though Father 's clients purchased mostly for this purpose , privately he scoffed at those who arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The artist is an aristocrat , Max , " my father told me . " He has suffered for his art . And yet still he is generous , because he offers us a new language that permits us to converse outside of words . " <br> I often wished that Father would not converse outside of words but , rather , raise other subjects during these meetings and guide me on boyhood matters , such as girls in sweaters or my birthday choice of alpine skis . Once or twice , I sensed that he tried to . I waited patiently , nearly holding my breath so as not to break the spell when Father began , " Over the years , I have wanted to tell you  --  " But this sentence , though repeated , was never finished , and eventually I gave up hope . Still , the nightly recitations were treasured occasions with my father , a man for whose attention many people , including my mother , had to fight . <br> In my memory of those nights in the gallery with pictures orbiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had a brushy mustache , a neat chin , and a slim neck . He wore a white collar and a long tie the shade and sheen of obsidian : a lean , angular man , as if he had stepped out of a canvas by Modigliani and , dusting the paint from his dinner jacket , taken his place against the gallery 's doorjamb . He parted his black hair on the side and his eyebrows looked penciled in . His face might have seemed too small were it not for the significant ears , the plane of his cheekbones , and his long , sloping nose . <br> As pictures were hoisted to the walls and then lowered , President Doumer was shot dead at a book fair , the Lindbergh son was kidnapped , and America choked in a cloud of dust . All of France seemed to be on strike . By eleven , I was expected to discuss various genres and artists . <br> " On still lifes , " my father began , and walked to the back of the red divan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Courbet painted his in prison . " <br> " Yes . " <br> " With landscape painting only slightly superior . " <br> From upstairs , we heard Mother singing along with her piano playing . Sometimes she sang the orchestra parts to Brahms or Beethoven , or hummed along with the piano melody so as not to lose her place in it as her fingers whirled through their steps . If Father was rehearsing the art of recollection with me , we both knew that Mother , with her hundreds of hours of music committed to memory , reigned supreme . <br> Whatever sensitivity Father and I might have possessed , Mother surpassed this , too : she heard sharps in the opening and closing of my dresser drawers and an unpleasant A-flat when the telephone rang . She thanked Father for choosing an automobile whose motor played an excellent C. When Mother traveled to Zurich and London to perform , I was left in the care of our housekeeper , Lucie , and our chauffeur , Auguste . Both loved music and , fortunately , both loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a young man who lit his father 's cigarette before smoking his own . The fixed point in Father 's collection was Manet 's Almonds , painted in the years between 1869 and 1871 . It was the one painting from my youth that had never left 21 , rue de La BoTtie , not in the first auction nor in the dozens that would follow . When Father bought Manet 's The Bar at the Folies- BergFre before lunch and sold it by dinnertime to a British sugar magnate , Almonds stayed behind ; Picasso 's The Family of Saltimbanques was shipped to New York , but Almonds stayed behind . Even when Mrs. Guggenheim was on her campaign , as she told Father , to buy " a picture a day , " Almonds remained . Father claimed that no one offered him the right price for it , though later I came to understand otherwise . Father loved the painting , though he would not say why , except that it was painted by a humbled man nearing the end of his life , when Manet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer stand at his grand canvases , as he had done with The Execution of Maximilian or The Bar at the Folies- BergFre . The man whose life had begun to still began to paint still lifes . I did not consider Manet 's Almonds beautiful . I found it morbid and sad to look at in the morning hours , when the light was clear and bright . In comparison to CTzanne , who often had to replace his pyramids of apples with wax versions because the real fruit rotted after a fortnight of study , Manet 's almonds were the ones that had been passed over , deemed too inferior to eat , painted by someone who 'd had his fill . <br> When the time came to take my winter exams , Father explained that he could not " with good conscience " pass his beautiful gallery down to me . The day before , there was news of Kristallnacht in Berlin ; Mother had said , " surely your courses will be canceled , " but they were not . <br> For a year , we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sudden rejection : I lacked , he had said , the memory , the business acumen , the ruthlessness , and the lucidity of vision to predict what could be bought one spring and sold a dozen Junes hence . " I wish for you a stable life , " he said . " My father drove too fast . " This I did not hear . I was made to fill out the exams and forms for the schooling that would land me in the hospital , not as a patient like my father long ago , but as a doctor . I resolved to fail as brilliantly as I had once studied to inherit the gallery . Eventually , Father and I resumed our nightly study of the paintings , but it was never the same as before . I was seventeen years old . <br> Continues ...
