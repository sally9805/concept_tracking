The stock market can make anyone look bad  --  even a billionaire investor like Laurence Tisch , who will step down as CEO of Loews Corp . by year 's end . Shareholders may wish he had stepped down sooner , given his errant attempts to time the market over the past two years . Tisch , a contrarian , is smarter than most . After oil prices receded in the early ' 80s , his company bought oil tankers and drilling rigs at scrap-metal prices and later sold them for a tenfold gain . But he 's lost big betting the company 's cash against the Standard &; Poor 's 500 , and its stock has suffered as a result . <P> Tisch 's " short " positions in various individual stocks and the S &P; 500 index produced losses of $918 million as the market rose in 1997 . The losses mounted this year : $534 million in the first quarter and $134 million in the second quarter . Finally , in the mayhem of the third quarter , his bearish bets paid off with gains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too early  --  cost Tisch 's company $1.2 billion . That should make your last 401(k) statement look a little better . <P> There are three lessons to learn from this tale : <P>  --  Market timing does n't work . Selective plumping and pruning is one thing . I heartily advocate yearly or quarterly rebalancing of your portfolio : selling some of the asset class that has done best and buying more of the one that has lagged to maintain your desired mix of stocks , bonds and cash . I even endorse shifting among assets with part of your portfolio  --  no more than 20%  --  to try to take advantage of specific conditions every so often . Early this year I suggested tilting toward bonds because stocks were overvalued and lower interest rates seemed likely . Some wags would call that timing . I call it adjusting to the shifting balance of risk and opportunity . Besides , investing should be at least some fun , or you will lose interest . <P> But big market bets are for losers . You have to be right twice : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom . And even if you get it right , the payoff is n't that great . Between 1988 and 1997 , if you had invested a set amount each year on the day the market peaked , you still would have made 18.2% a year . If you had picked the market 's low point each year , you 'd have made 20.2% . Being in the market  --  time , not timing  --  is what matters most . <P>  --  Recognize your mistakes . It 's said that surgeons often make lousy investors because their work requires a supreme self-confidence that can hurt them in the markets . They 'll hold a stock until they get even or go broke . That 's a fatal attitude . When a stock has fallen , you 've lost the money whether you sell or not . Take another look , and be ready to accept that you might have missed something the first time . That 's what Tisch did . Last quarter Loews " reduced its exposure " to the stuff that produced the massive losses . Now is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't buy them at this price , consider selling to lock in a tax savings before year 's end . <P>  --  Contrary investing is an art . Big money can be made betting against the herd . But the herd often gathers considerable momentum . The art is in knowing when it 's running out of steam . If , like Tisch , you 're right but early , you may pay dearly . Instead , try value investing : hunt for solid stocks whose prices are low relative to their book value or expected earnings . Such stocks will probably rise , and if they fall , wo n't fall so far .
