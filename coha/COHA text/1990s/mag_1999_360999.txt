AIDS . Fifty years ago , it did n't exist . Fifteen years ago , a few doctors and public health officials noticed the first cases . Within a few years , it was clear that it had reached epidemic status . It has now killed almost 14 million people around the world . <P> Four years ago , doctors came up with the first treatment to make a dent in the spiraling death rate . Today that treatment works for some patients , but it 's not clear how long the results will last . And still there is no cure . <P> For the nearly 35 million people around the world now living with HIV , there may never be a cure . Once cells are infected with HIV , it 's excruciatingly difficult  --  perhaps impossible  --  to rid them of the virus . The only sure way to stop the epidemic is to prevent infection in the first place , and only a vaccine can do that . <P> Unfortunately , HIV is one of the most changeable viruses known to science . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moving target through all its mutations , trying to find a few common elements among all the strains in circulation that they can use to concoct an effective vaccine . <P> So far , about two dozen vaccines have been tested , most made from proteins found on the virus ' coat and delivered via another , inactivated virus such as canarypox . While such vaccines are safe and successful in triggering antibodies , it 's not clear that any will be sufficiently powerful to combat the strains of the virus that are currently in circulation . <P> Most of the formulations , for example , fail to get the body to churn out enough of the T cells that are needed to target and destroy HIV-infected cells . <P> Even without a vaccine , however , there is hope . The arsenal of treatment options has expanded considerably in recent years . Antivirals given to pregnant mothers have proved effective in preventing transmission to newborns , and a new , shorter treatment shows promise for use in developing nations . <P> For many older patients , protease inhibitors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have kept HIV at below detectable levels . And while recent studies show that some HIV stubbornly hides from the drugs ' reach , early evidence suggests that these sequestered strains may not be infectious . Drug holidays  --  brief respites from the grueling and complex medication regimen  --  are also being studied , since some patients who have voluntarily stopped their therapy have experienced no return of symptoms . <P> The new drugs are not without their problems , however . Patients may have to take them for the rest of their lives , and the expense and complexity of the regimen keep them out of reach for the 9 out of 10 patients who live in developing nations . <P> Still , the billions of dollars spent on AIDS research over the past 20 years has not been wasted . As scientists learn more about how HIV co-opts the human body to survive , they are realizing that drugs alone may not be enough . To contain the virus effectively , it may take a balance between drug therapy that keeps HIV levels low and a bolstered immune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until scientists find a vaccine , however , they may control but never cure the century 's final scourge . <P>  --  By Alice Park
