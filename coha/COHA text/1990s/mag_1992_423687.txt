Section : World report Hot spots U.S. troops are in Somalia to deliver food , but many Somalis expect them to rebuild a nation <p> Dateline : Mogadishu <p> Less than 24 hours after the first U.S. marines landed in Somalia , Operation Restore Hope already had begun to live up to its name . In the war-torn capital of Mogadishu , guns almost disappeared from the streets . Food began arriving at the city 's main airport . Relief workers moved through town without armed escorts . And , in perhaps the most curious sign that a sense of normalcy had returned to Somalia 's Italian-influenced Muslim capital , one elated shopkeeper turned on his Christmas lights . <p> The American flag was hoisted over the U.S. Embassy , which had been evacuated in January 1991 when heavy fighting toppled the 21-year dictatorship of Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre , America 's cold-war ally . The flag the Marines raised last week is the one that was lowered from the Marine barracks at the Beirut airport after a truck bomb killed 241 American servicemen in 1983 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambiguities that await the United States in a country it has scarcely begun to understand . <p> If America 's only objective is to stop a high-profile African famine , Operation Restore Hope should be a success . Though hundreds of Somalis are still dying every day , relief workers believe that with marines and other foreign troops from the U.S.-led coalition providing security , the famine that has claimed some 300,000 lives can be brought to an end within months . <p> Rebuilding . But if America 's mission is to put Somalia on the road to recovery , a much riskier step is called for : using U.S. military might , economic aid and political influence to help rebuild the country . The last two years of war have undeveloped ' Somalia . Its infrastructure is destroyed and its economy ruined . The tenuous balances of clan power that once held the nation together are shattered . <p> Andrew Natsios , the U.S. aid coordinator for Somalia , estimates that 4.5 million Somalis are severely affected ' by famine and 2 million could lose their lives . A recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta found that in the famine-wracked town of Baidoa , more people died from respiratory infection and dysentery than starvation . Some 2,000 people now live in Mogadishu 's 400-bed Digfer Hospital , most of them refugees , and when the hospital 's generator gave out last week , emergency patients had to wait two days for surgery . Hundreds of schools , businesses and factories in the Somali capital have been flattened by the warlords ' artillery duels . Most houses have no running water or sewerage . Potholes in the city 's crumbling streets are so large that even the marines ' humvees avoid them . <p> The war has left virtually the entire nation unemployed . Most Somalis have reverted to subsistence-level businesses such as market gardening , bartering and black-market currency deals . Agriculture , once the mainstay of the southern regions , has ground to a halt , industry has collapsed and financial institutions have disappeared . One bright spot is that the Somali shilling has almost doubled in value against the dollar , thanks to black marketeers ' expectations of a windfall from 28,000 American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their objectives in Somalia , and that leaves many questions unanswered . Will U.S. troops be used only for the emergency relief operation or will they disarm the warring clan factions that helped cause the famine ? Will Army engineers and Navy Seabees repair only the infrastructure essential to the emergency feeding program , or will they rehabilitate damaged schools , government buildings and communications networks ? Even the political role of the United States and its special envoy , Ambassador Robert Oakley , is murky . <p> The chief unanswered question , though , is when and under what circumstances American troops can begin to withdraw . U.S. armed forces will remain in Somalia only as long as necessary to establish a secure environment for humanitarian relief operations , ' President Bush told Congress in a letter last week . Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said he hoped the bulk of the forces we are putting in there will be gone within three months . ' But President-elect Bill Clinton said an artificial timetable ' can not be imposed on the troops ' mission . <p> U.S. officials insist that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no government in place and none on the horizon , entanglement is going to be difficult to avoid . Just days after the first marines landed , Washington was drawn deeper into Somalia 's struggles when U.S. officials enabled Somalia 's two main warlords , Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid and Ali Mahdi Mohamed , to hold their first face-to-face meeting in the temporary quarters of U.S. envoy Oakley . <p> Meanwhile , U.N . Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali , who is trying to arrange a January 4 meeting of rival Somali leaders , has asked U.S. officials to expand the mission of American forces in Somalia to include pacifying the country and training a police force . There is a disconnect between the U.S. and the U.N . missions , ' says a senior Pentagon official , who says the U.S. objective is merely to get relief supplies moving again while the U.N . expects the United States to make peace . <p> Marine peacemakers ? Somali expectations are even higher . Most Somalis believe the Marines ' primary task is to restore stability to their country , and they think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secondary U.S. concern . In fact , many Somalis think the United States would not have intervened if it did not intend to end their devastating civil war . It 's very , very nice to do this , ' said Ahmed Mohammed Arale as he watched the first U.S. helicopters arrive at Mogadishu 's main airport last week . I 'm happy they have come to make peace in this country . ' <p> Weaker clans , such as the southern Rahanweyn , are expecting the United States to level the playing field to include them . I think America 's purpose is very clear , ' says Hassan Scek Ibrahim , a Rahanweyn lawyer and political leader . We consider their job is to prepare the national reconciliation . ' <p> Major warlords such as General Aidid , however , expect to be politically rewarded for the amount of territory under their control . I think they the Americans will side with the majority , ' warns Osman Ato , Aidid 's second-in-command . I do n't think there 's any other option open to the Americans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs , the greater the danger of becoming embroiled in endless negotiations among the warlords , factions , clans and subclans . Accusations of bias are almost sure to follow . Such charges bedeviled the U.N . ' s efforts to play honest broker and left the U.N . relief effort hostage to the tortuous process of political reconciliation . <p> Racketbusting . Still , the arrival of U.S. troops has left the warlords little choice but to come to the negotiating table . The lucrative protection rackets they once ran are collapsing as guns and technicals ' disappear from the streets . The relief food the warlords used to pay fighters has dried up now that the marines are providing security for relief convoys within Mogadishu . Even the profitable trade in the popular stimulant known as khat has been impaired because the warlords can no longer guarantee its safe transport from Kenya ( story , Page 65 ) . <p> Last week both of Mogadishu 's main warlords promised to work toward reconciliation . But even if they reach some agreement , it will only mean that the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , which both General Aidid and his rival Ali Mahdi have been fighting to control , has been reunified . Though a USC rapprochement is a major step , dozens of other warring factions throughout the country remain split between clans , subclans and families . <p> If lasting peace is to come , these factions must resolve internal differences and then enter into negotiations with one another . But even reaching that distant horizon presents problems because of Somaliland , the northern section of the country that seceded in 1991 . Most southerners want it back . <p> Gun culture . The enormous first step toward any political settlement is disarming both the warlords and the population in a culture in which guns have become synonymous with survival . Says Ali Shido Habdi , Somalia 's former ambassador to France and Saudi Arabia : Unless complete disarmament takes place , a political settlement can not be achieved . ' <p> Despite U.N . Secretary General Boutros-Ghali 's call for using military force to confiscate weapons , including heavy artillery , U.S. military officials say they will only disarm fighters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're going to confiscate the weapons we see as a direct threat , ' says Marine spokesman Col. Fred Peck , but we 're not going out searching for them . ' <p> In one instance last week , marines were ordered not to confiscate a recoilless rifle , heavy machine guns and more than 40,000 rounds of AK-47 ammunition they discovered inside a compound owned by General Aidid 's second-in-command , Osman Ato . Marine officials say the decision was made to avoid charges that U.S. forces are taking sides in Somalia 's political feuds . <p> There also is a danger of conjuring up ugly American ' images . Many Somalis were horrified by the marines ' rough handling of unarmed airport workers in the early hours of last week 's deployment . That 's not the way people should be treated , ' said Ahmed Mohammed Arale , a former airline employee , as a group of marines hustled off a middle-aged worker who was screaming in Italian , the language of one of Somalia 's former colonizers : Colonizzatori . ' <p> The Marines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siad Barre fell , warlords looted government stocks of American and Soviet weaponry . For now , the fate of those weapons appears to be a political , rather than a military , problem . The Somalis have to take the lead on disarmament , ' U.S. envoy Oakley told reporters . <p> Pentagon officials have hinted at using a buyback scheme like the one used in Panama after the fall of Manuel Noriega . That may work for ordinary Somalis who have taken up arms in self-defense , but the young gunmen for whom AK-47s and M-16s have become their way of staying alive are unlikely to give up the tools of their trade for a few dollars . <p> So far , however , the mere threat of weapons ' being confiscated has produced a kind of de facto disarmament in Mogadishu . According to residents , the guns that once were visible on every street corner have been buried , sold or sequestered in houses and shacks . Heavily armed technicals have either been disarmed by their employers or driven out of the city . Said a beaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made his first trip to the airport without an armed guard in 15 months : The city is virtually gun-free . ' <p> The old order . But many Somalis already are angry at what they consider a short-term solution . Somali diplomat Ali Shido Habdi and other leading intellectuals believe the focus of disarmament must be the countryside , especially Somalia 's former agricultural heartland between the Jubba and Shabeelle rivers , where the powerful Marehan and Hawiye clans have battled . The intellectuals reason that once clans such as the Marehan and the Hawiye are disarmed , they will return to their traditional regions , and a semblance of the old order will be restored . <p> That is unlikely . In fact , the opposite is already occurring as technicals and gunmen retreat into the countryside ahead of the foreign troops . And even if their warlords agree to disarm , tenuous lines of command and shifting alliances put the renegades beyond the control of all but their immediate superiors . <p> The Somalis can be forgiven for thinking that the fresh-faced Americans , with all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . The bombed-out Protestant church in Mogadishu North is missing its roof . Its insides are gutted ; its stained glass is smashed . All that remains are the iron candelabra looters were unable to twist from its walls . Today people use it as a public toilet . These Americans have decided on their own to come and solve our problems , ' says Nuur Mohammed Abdul , a 53-year-old tailor who was once a member of the church . I do n't think they can leave with things half finished . ' <p> But the tailor and his countrymen may turn out to be wrong . <p> PHOTO : Welcome .

Marines set up roadblocks , but rules about seizing arms from locals were left fuzzy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ILLUSTRATION <p> By Eric Ransdell <p> Hope and despair in Baidoa THE MOREAAN NUTTERS ' AND THE DEATH BUS <p> Dateline : Baidoa <p> Lockten Morrissey , the local director of CARE International in Baidoa , apologized for the smell of the gasoline he was pouring onto the ground around a jeep parked outside his fortified bungalow . As he emptied a jerrycan into the jeep 's cabin , he waved a group of his fellow relief workers inside for a routine meeting . Wo n't be long , ' he called . I 'm just sorting out a minor security problem . Help yourselves to a cuppa and I 'll be in in a sec . ' <p> Then the Australian turned to the half-dozen teenagers who had arrived in the jeep with a heavy machine gun and an assortment of automatic rifles in an attempt to loot the CARE compound . If you lot do n't bugger off before I get out of my meeting , ' he said , I shall torch your car . ' The teenage gunmen retreated . <p> Death bus . ' This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a normal town . Between July and November the death bus , ' a truck that collects corpses each morning from 7 to 9:30 , often picked up 350 bodies on its 25-stop route . By one estimate , 12,255 people died in Baidoa between mid-August and mid-November ; the actual number may be far higher . <p> Two years of civil war and anarchy have reduced this fertile region , 140 miles west of Mogadishu , to a barren wilderness . But even before the U.N . Security Council acted on December 3 , the situation had begun to improve . By the first week of this month the death bus was carrying an average of only 40 passengers each morning . <p> Perversely , the United Nations decision to sanction the deployment of American troops in Somalia touched off an eleventh-hour rampage by gunmen in their armed jeeps . Racing down the town 's main drag , the driver of a six-wheel , Soviet-made truck known as the Big Boss , ' which carries an antiaircraft cannon , settled an old grudge against a rival family by careering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead women 's clan retaliated by opening fire on the Big Boss 's people in the center of town , where starving nomads peddle their water gourds for the price of a bowl of rice . Fifty people , mostly civilians , were killed and another 50 were injured . <p> Foreign aid workers in Baidoa quickly metamorphosed from Samaritans into military tacticians . After a night of fighting outside his house and attacks on the International Committee of the Red Cross compound down the street , Lockten Morrissey turned his bungalow into a bunker . Local guards , who had taken 96 million shillings ( $20,000 ) from Morrissey at gunpoint the week before , set up machine gun nests on his roof and barricaded the house with sandbags and water-filled barrels . Pat Johns from the U.S.-based Catholic Relief Services increased the armed guard on his house from three men to eight . <p> Now , relief workers in Baidoa worry that the arrival of the Americans in Mogadishu has created problems rather than solved them . By going to Mogadishu without hitting the interior they have just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assistant director of the Irish charity Concern , which runs feeding programs in remote villages . They made no effort to contact people who have been working on the ground here for months . We could have told them that they should move in all over the country at once . When they do finally arrive in Baidoa the gunmen will simply move on and plunder other villages . ' <p> We have been waiting for the Americans and they do n't come , ' said Abdulahi Mohamed , an unemployed accountant . Are they afraid ? They are afraid . They are scared of getting shot at while my people are dying from hunger and from the moreaan bandits . They have just made things worse . ' <p> PHOTO : Daily rounds . Every morning Baidoa 's death bus ' collects the city 's dead . ( CHERYL HATCH ) <p> By Sam Kiley <p> Khat time THE PAUSE THAT PERTURBS <p> Pentagon planners , who try to anticipate every contingency , may have had a hard time accounting for the khat factor . Every afternoon in Somalia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government workers , merchants , gunmen , ordinary men and ordinary women all chew the green leaf . Western doctors who have lived in Somalia , a Muslim nation where alcohol use is prohibited , compare the effects of khat to those of coffee  --  a lot of coffee . But it is hard to determine what U.S. soldiers ought to do when confronted with an armed man who has just consumed the equivalent of six cups of espresso . <p> In fact , khat predates coffee . In the 14th century , Yemenis started picking the leaves of the Catha edulis plant , a small tree that grows on hillsides . Most khat now comes from Kenya , but the arrival of U.S. troops has disrupted the traffic . <p> Social ritual . Like teatime in Britain , khat time is a social occasion ; in fact , it 's rude to chew alone . Like coffee , khat reduces appetite , increases alertness and produces nervous energy and mild euphoria . And like coffee , there are many varieties  --  about 80 . But unlike the effects of coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is consumed . There 's a big difference between chewers , ' explains Dr. Tokuo Yoshida of the World Health Organization . Vigorous chewers are more likely to extract more of khat 's active ingredients , cathinone and cathine . <p> Relief workers say the main problem with khat is economic : A day 's supply now costs $10  --  50 percent more than before U.S. troops arrived  --  and productivity plummets when work halts so everyone can chew . Somalis , no matter how poor , continue to buy khat , and sales kept Somalia 's warlords going . <p> Former Somali President Mohammed Siad Barre banned khat use in 1983 , but prohibition only drove the trade underground  --  where Siad Barre 's Marehan clan could control it . <p> By Julie Corwin <p>
