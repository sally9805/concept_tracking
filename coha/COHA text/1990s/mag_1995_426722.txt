A Look At Packaging <p> Few experiences in contemporary life offer the visual intensity of a Safeway , a Krogers , a Pathmark , or a Piggly Wiggly . No marketplace in the world  --  not Marrakesh or Calcutta or Hong Kong  --  offers so many different goods with such focused salesmanship as your neighborhood supermarket , where you 're exposed to a thousand different products a minute . No wonder it 's tiring to shop . <p> There are , however , some major differences between the supermarket and a traditional marketplace . The cacophony of a traditional market has given way to programmed , innocuous music , punctuated by enthusiastically intoned commercials . A stroll through a traditional market offers an array of sensuous aromas ; if you are conscious of smelling something in a supermarket , there is a problem . The life and death matter of eating , expressed in traditional markets by the sale of vegetables with stems and roots and by hanging animal carcasses , is purged from the supermarket , where food is processed somewhere else , or at least trimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between a traditional market and the places through which you push your cart is that in a modern retail setting nearly all the selling is done without people . The product is totally dissociated from the personality of any particular person selling it  --  with the possible exception of those who appear in its advertising . The supermarket purges sociability , which slows down sales . It allows manufacturers to control the way they present their products to the world . It replaces people with packages . <p> For manufacturers , packaging is the crucial final payoff to a marketing campaign . Sophisticated packaging is one of the chief ways people find the confidence to buy . It can also give a powerful image to products and commodities that are in themselves characterless . In many cases , the shopper has been prepared for the shopping experience by lush , colorful print advertisements , 30-second television minidramas , radio jingles , and coupon promotions . But the package makes the final sales pitch , seals the commitment , and gets itself placed in the shopping cart . Advertising leads consumers into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is what makes the product possible . <p> But the package is also useful to the shopper . It is a tool for simplifying and speeding decisions . Packages promise , and usually deliver , predictability . One reason you do n't think about packages is that you do n't need to . The candy bar , the aspirin , the baking powder , or the beer in the old familiar package may , at times , be touted as new and improved , but it will rarely be very different . <p> You put the package into your cart , or not , usually without really having focused on the particular product or its many alternatives . But sometimes you do examine the package . You read the label carefully , looking at what the product promises , what it contains , what it warns . You might even look at the package itself and judge whether it will , for example , reseal to keep a product fresh . You might consider how a cosmetic container will look on your dressing table , or you might think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be easily recycled . The possibility of such scrutiny is one of the things that make each detail of the package so important . <p> The environment through which you push your shopping cart is extraordinary because of the amount of attention that has been paid to the packages that line the shelves . At the supermarket , each box and jar , stand-up pouch and squeeze bottle , each can and bag and tube and spray has been very carefully considered . Designers have worked and reworked the design on their computers and tested mock-ups on the store shelves . Refinements are measured in millimeters . <p> The forces driving package design are not primarily aesthetic . Market researchers have conducted surveys of consumer wants and needs , and consultants have studied photographs of families ' kitchen cupboards and medicine chests to get a sense of how products are used . Test subjects have been tied into pieces of heavy apparatus that measure their eye movement , their blood pressure or body temperature , when subjected to different packages . Psychologists get people to talk about the packages in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they want . Government regulators and private health and safety advocates worry over package design and try to make it truthful . Stock-market analysts worry about how companies are managing their " brand equity , " that combination of perceived value and consumer loyalty that is expressed in advertising but embodied in packaging . The retailer is paying attention to the packages in order to weed out the ones that do n't sell or are n't sufficiently profitable . The use of supermarket scanners generates information on the profitability of every cubic inch of the store . Space on the supermarket shelf is some of the most valuable real estate in the world , and there are always plenty of new packaged products vying for display . <p> Display is the most obvious element of packaging . But what the package shows is tightly edited to focus on the satisfaction that the product will provide . Consumers are interested in whether the cleaner will remove mildew from the shower stall or whether the frozen dinner promises to be tasty . A few may look carefully at ingredients and nutritional information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of packaging is that you do n't have to worry about the process that brings a product into being . You can make a good decision without even having to think about it . <p> Just because much of people 's response to packages is emotional and subconscious , that does n't mean that people are gullible or powerless . Rather , it is the kind of rapid , unreflective communication of information that allows , for example , the pilot of a jet fighter plane to guide an object moving at supersonic speeds as if it were his own body . The point of being precise and evocative in your packaging design , then , is not to manipulate but to communicate so effectively that the shopper will understand immediately . <p> All packages contain some measure of information . Even if all the package tells you is what it contains and how much of it , that 's useful . Moreover , the information can generally be trusted . Adulteration of packaged products is rare . Short-weighting of contents is far more frequent , but is seldom dramatic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingers on the scale , shoppers generally believe that brand-name packaged products are precisely what they say they are . <p> Moreover , shopping by the list is the exception rather than the rule . For example , grocery shoppers may have a general idea of what they are looking for , but far more often than not , they go to the supermarket , walk down the aisle , and let the packages speak to them . By surrendering in this way to the irrational , they play into the hands of food manufacturers and retailers . Such unplanned shopping leads to far higher grocery purchases than does a list based on rigorous analysis of household needs . But such a focused , rational approach entails a level of effort that many prefer not to make . On the store 's shelves is a vast array of appetizing suggestions , and on the packages ' backs , there is a library 's worth of recipes . <p> The communicative power of packages is so strong that consumer advocates have fought , with some success , to reshape them as educational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can of peaches , for example , and learn precisely what quantities of nutrients it contains and how much of your recommended daily intake it provides . There might even be some suggestions about what else you ought to eat to achieve a healthy diet . A fresh peach may be juicier , but it does not begin to tell you so much . Some packages , such as cigarettes and liquor bottles , are required by law to say that their contents are harmful , though they tend to do it in condensed light-faced type that is difficult to read . The same is true for disclosure of contents or processes that most people would prefer not to know about . " From Concentrate " on fruit juice containers and " Contains Sulfites " on wine bottles are among the skinniest words in the language . <p> It 's not clear whether packages will ever really teach people about nutrition . Their principal focus will probably always be to convince buyers that what 's inside is satisfying . <p> However , the informational content of nonfood packaging has become extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a service , such as tires , have made it to self-service outlets . Some tires are now shrink-wrapped with data on tread life , stopping distances , and other important information visible to the buyer . Computers and other electronic equipment come in cartons that illustrate and describe the equipment inside and , in some cases , also contain instructions about how to set up the equipment and how to recycle the packing materials . Even such big-ticket items are marketed under the assumption that the package must answer potential buyers ' questions and assuage their concerns . The package that offers clear , useful graphics and writing offers the best service a customer is likely to receive . Much of the time it is the only service . <p> This concept is hardly new . " The display container is as much of a salesman as any flesh-and-blood clerk , and often more , " wrote Richard B. Franken and Carrol B. Larabee in their 1928 book Packages That Sell , " for it works night and day for one product and emphasizes only those sales arguments which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment , though some feel it does so by accelerating thought , while others feel that it short-circuits intelligence . In any event , today 's packages embody conflicts between reason and emotion , government and business , words and colors , form and content . <p> People are affected by packaging in ways that they do not consciously understand . On that , both packagers and consumer advocates agree . The controversy is whether to see this as a key technology of our consumer society or to try to work against the power of packaging and slow shoppers down . Packages are everywhere , and by their nature they contain information as well as products . Some of this information consists of words and numbers , directed to the rational mind , while other facets , consisting of shapes , colors , and graphic expressions , bypass the rational and appeal directly to consumers ' emotions . Consumer advocates focus on regulations that enable people to make rational decisions . Package researchers and designers say they see labeling regulations as inevitable and , in most cases , desirable . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and on the consumer 's side . But the researchers have plenty of evidence that reasoned analysis plays only a small role in most shoppers ' decisions . <p> Packages currently available in American stores are typically the work of designers , engineers , and one or more government agencies including the Department of Agriculture ; the Consumer Product Safety Commission ; the Environmental Protection Agency ; the Federal Trade Commission ; the Department of Health and Human Services ; the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , and Firearms ; and the Customs Service . <p> The recent , massive relabeling effort was one of the most dramatic successes by consumer advocates in a long history of attempts to use the communicative power of packaging to impart useful information . The idea is to use packages to provide objective grounds for judgment . It is an extension of the principles of the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 and the failed 1933 attempt to impose uniform grade labeling on all products . <p> The principal impact of the new regulations for the great majority of packages was the inclusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldface type . The box contains such information as total calories per serving , calories from fat , and the amounts of fat , cholesterol , sodium , carbohydrates , and protein . Below , in smaller type , it contains the percentages of daily requirements of certain vitamins and recommended intakes of these nutrients . Thus , every food package now contains a condensed guide to overall diet . Most food products had contained some of this information before . What the new regulations did was standardize such issues as serving size , make the information as legible as possible , and seek to give the shopper a basis for comparison . <p> But while getting the complex " Nutrition Facts " box onto the package was frequently a nuisance for designers , manufacturers were largely unconcerned , precisely because of the large amount of information it contained . The " Nutrition Facts " box requires analytic thinking , and even mental mathematics . Most shoppers do not even keep track of how much money they are spending , let alone tally the number of grams of saturated fat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tiny fraction of a second , so there is little likelihood that increasing information at the point of purchase will increase the rationality of consumers ' decisions . <p> That 's the major reason the Food and Drug Administration has resisted an initiative by the American Heart Association to put its logo on products that have met its standards as healthy foods . The logo would be easy to read , and officials have said they fear its presence would cause shoppers to ignore the nutrition facts and make quick decisions based on the endorsement , without regard for how they will use the product as part of their diet . Regulators hope to slow shoppers down , not speed them up . <p> Package designers generally expect that the regulations ' chief impact will be on products that are sold on a nutritional basis . While shoppers generally grab packages automatically , they sometimes scrutinize products carefully to make comparisons , and the labels will enable shoppers to weigh , for example , Healthy Choice against Lean Cuisine . And the impact of nutrition information might well be greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people really do read cereal boxes . If a cereal that is being sold as healthful and nutritious turns out to contain a lot of fat , it will eventually be noticed . <p> Although the expectation that the new nutrition label will be studied at the store is unrealistic for most packages most of the time , this first encounter on the shelf is only the beginning of the shopper 's relationship with the package . At home , there is more time to read the material , and packages are not arranged in the cupboard with their selling face forward . Manufacturers use the sides and backs of packages to include complex information , such as recipes , which are intended to accelerate use of the product and induce repeat purchases . Thus , the complex information of the nutrition box is not necessarily wasted , especially if it helps consumers make decisions about what to purchase next time . <p> " If one wants to act rationally , one must , at all costs , find a reason which makes the irrational seem rational , " writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what appears on the package  --  especially the words  --  is there to reassure consumers that their impulsive choice was also a sensible one . <p> Thus , nutritional information on the package wo n't be emotionally neutral . Anything that 's put on a package  --  even a bunch of scientific names and numbers  --  can trigger feelings as well as thoughts . <p> " One peculiar impact of the new requirements is that products that have essentially no nutritional benefits at all will have a label that says ' Nutrition Facts , ' " says John Lister , president of Lister-Butler , a leading design firm . He argues that the mere association of junk food with the word " nutrition " might give it more respectability and ease people 's guilt in purchasing the products . He adds , though , that it would eliminate past abuses , such as cracker packages that showed crackers and soup together as a " serving suggestion . " " The nutritional chart looked terrific , " he says , " but all the crackers contributed was flour and sodium . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was pictured on the package , but was n't contained inside . <p> Such a tactic was n't , strictly speaking , dishonest . A careful reader could understand that the information referred to the total meal , not simply to the crackers . The problem is that most people do n't read a package as if it were a legal contract . Usually , they do n't read the package at all . <p> Package design is successful to the extent that it communicates very complex messages to people who give it little conscious thought . This may pre- vent packaging from becoming art , but it does define a unique strength that is potentially very valuable . Emotion can be seen as a very rapid means by which humans process information . And no field of design deals more effectively with the emotions than does packaging . <p> Packages unashamedly use words where they are most appropriate , but they also deploy powerful visual messages that the brain is able to grasp without conscious analysis . If this kind of power could be applied to software , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer use becomes truly universal , and scarcely conscious . Surely , navigating through the often promised world of 500-channel television would be easier if people could do it in their accustomed supermarket trance rather than have to struggle with a road map . Indeed , the experience of the information superhighway will probably not be that of driving a car at high speed through a featureless landscape . Rather , it will be like moving at your own pace through an environment of vividly presented choices . The future will be like going shopping . <p> By Thomas Hine <p> <p> Mr. Hine writes a nationally syndicated column on architecture and design for the Philadelphia Inquirer .
