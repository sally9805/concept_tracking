In my dreams I am never in the wheelchair . Usually I have legs , and at times I have the stump and somehow walk with my one damaged leg . One afternoon , on the first day of autumn , I lay clothed on my bed and slept , and dreamed I was driving on a sunlit and warm afternoon . My golden retriever , Luke , was in the car . I was driving southeast toward the sea on a two-lane asphalt road through rolling country with trees and meadows . I could sense the Atlantic to my left , beyond the hills . There was no one else on the road . I did not know where I was going , or why , or how I would know when I got there ; but I knew I was driving to a place . The road dipped and wound between trees , then flattened , and on my left was a green field . Beside it was an asphalt parking space and I turned into it and parked vertically and , with Luke , got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . Luke was very old and slow then . The grass was above my ankles , and I started to run ; Luke ran beside me , and now he was leaner , young and quick . Then I saw that I was too : I was running smoothly , wearing burgundy slacks I had worn in my thirties . We started up a long slope with high grass , and we were breathing easily , and suddenly I knew I was dead . Imagine this : you have a one-year-old child ; you are driving alone in your car , on a highway , and your home is thirty minutes behind you . Then all at once your breath and heart quicken , and a chill rises from your stomach to your heart and spreads : you have left home without your child , you did not mean to , but this is what you have done , and the child is alone and must have you now and you must be there now , in this quivering instant of loss so bright that you do not even see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky ; you see only the child crawling on the floor and the great distance between your back and the child you have left behind to hunger and thirst , to be alone , to be afraid , to be taken by a madman , to die in the burning house . You must find an exit and make your way back to the highway going home , and you must do this faster than it can possibly be done ; you want to do it all at once , will yourself back to your child , with no intervals of time and space . <p> It was like that . I kept running . The slope curved to the right and I saw trees and low brick buildings in their shade . Luke and I ran to the top of the hill and slowed to a walk at the trees . A man stood ahead of us ; he wore a gray suit and a tie , and he smiled pleasantly as though he knew me . I stopped and said to him : " Am I dead ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I ca n't . I 've got two little girls . " <p> " You can see them . " <p> I followed him into the building on our left , and Luke stayed near the trees . The man and I walked down a cool and dim and very clean hall to a large room that was also dim and clean , where children played on the carpeted floor or sat in leather couches and chairs , watching television . They were the ages of my girls . There were no adults , and not all the children knew each other , but they seemed cared for , and they were content and patient . Soon parents would come and take them home . Then I saw Madeleine and Cadence . Madeleine was two , and she was playing on the floor with other children ; she was facing me , but looking down at toys . Cadence was seven . She was sitting on a leather couch with other girls , watching television , her face in profile to me . Madeleine looked up and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said : " I knew you 'd be able to see me . " <p> Then Cadence turned to me and said : " I saw you . " <p> I was no longer desperate to get back . I grieved because I could not , then I woke grieving and quickly left the bed and got onto my chair . I wheeled down the hall , remembering Swedenborg 's visions of heaven , where we become angels , where I could have both legs , and they would be young and strong . The sadness I fled from in my chair stayed with me in the early days of autumn . Now I write this on an afternoon in May , and lilacs are in a vase on my desk , and beyond the glass door in front of me young maples are bright green in the sun . Yesterday Cadence picked the lilacs for me . <p> <p> By ANDRE DUBUS <p>
