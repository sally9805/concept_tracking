THE INITIAL STRATEGY WAS TO STAY ABOVE THE fray . As American firms like Compaq , and IBM brought low-cost personal computers to its shores , NEC , Japan 's foremost personal computer manufacturer , controlling about 50% of the domestic market , loftily insisted that quality should take precedence over cost . But the price pressure got to the company . NEC has announced a new low-priced line , including one model for $1,740 , about half the price of an earlier comparable machine . <P> Aggressive American manufacturers , who currently have about 15% of the Japanese PC market , quickly countered NEC 's move with more slugging . IBM , together with the Japanese office-equipment maker Canon , announced the development of a notebook PC with a built-in printer that they would sell for $2,380 . Fast-growing Dell Computer opened a subsidiary in Tokyo and began its famed direct sales to customers . In Dell 's line : a PC for $780.
