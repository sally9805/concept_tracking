According to one person who helped work on it , the most famous opening title in film history nearly began " A long , long time ago in a galaxy far away ... " Not that that 's so different from " A long time ago in a galaxy far , far away ... " It 's just that Star Wars has become such a cultural given that it almost seems as if the film had been channeled from the pop ether fully formed and perfect , like a melody entering Paul McCartney 's head . With all the hoopla surrounding the current rerelease , it 's easy to forget just how dicey a proposition Star Wars was in 1977 when it opened not on 2,104 screens around the country , as it did last week , but on only 35  --  which itself suggests an entirely different era of moviegoing . No one associated with the film expected it to be a hit , not even writer-director George Lucas .
