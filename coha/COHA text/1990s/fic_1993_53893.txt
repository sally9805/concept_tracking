A BOY OF TWELVE , the year my father was dying , I used to go out to the garage during the summer evenings , just after dusk , and put on a pair of my mother 's high heels . I found them in a grocery sack of my sisters ' and my outgrown clothes to be given to the Salvation Army . Black leather sling pumps of the style fashionable in the previous decade , the forties , they did not seem badly worn , and they were not so large on me that they would slip off when I walked in them , not with the strap buckled to the last notch . I walked out of the garage in them , and when I reached the street , I could see the cars whizzing past on Robinson Avenue , a haft-block away . In the other direction , at the end of a two-block-long row of bungalows , lay a dark blankness . <p> This blankness was in fact a park , Edgemere Park , where in the daytime I might have gone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shallow creek . But at night the park looked faraway and menacing , a shimmering deep pool of darkness . And so I went no farther than the end of the driveway , standing as long as I dared , breathing in the sweet night air . It was a strange , eerie time . Neither a gifted nor a dull child , I craved getting by , preferably unnoticed , but there I stood , risking discovery and certain ridicule  --  and for what ? For the pleasure of it . It pleased me . I do n't know why . <p> Sometime during that autumn the shoes disappeared . The Salvation Army must have picked them up while I was in school . I was sorry to see them go . We never seemed to have enough money , and now that my father had stopped working , there would be even more stringent economies . Mother was n't likely to throw away another pair of shoes soon . I regretted the loss , but by this time my father 's illness had become severe and I imagined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making me pay attention to him and take up the role , as directed by my mother , of man of the family . <p> Mother worked full-time at Kerr 's Department Store and served as our father 's nurse all the months of his decline . We children did little to help her . After all , she did not tell us , not for the longest time , that he was dying . He worked too hard , she always said , and when he came home from his office at Oklahoma Gas &; Electric one hot July afternoon and said he did n't feel so well , she said he just needed to catch up on his rest . We  --  my two sisters and I  --  believed her . But he never went back to work at all . By the end of the summer he seldom left the back bedroom . Some months later we were told he had cancer . ! do not know if there was ever any pain . He was a silent , grim man , then as before . At Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was operated on , and we thought that would be the end of the trouble . We have to hope and pray for the best , Mother said . After the operation , he stayed in the hospital another three weeks before coming home . His body afire with secret wanton rot , he survived the remainder of the winter , lasted through the spring , and died on June 21 , 1954 , two days after his fortieth birthday , in his bed . Now at last he would rest , my mother said . <p> The Edgemere section of Oklahoma City where we lived was nowhere near the edge of any mere , which an elementary school teacher had told us was an old-fashioned word from England that meant sea . The park two blocks from our house , with its trickle of red water , was bordered by pleasant , quiet neighborhoods of modest but comfortable homes , most of them one-story , built during the boom years of the twenties , made of red or buff brick , their roofs pitched and pointed to resemble , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inhabited . A few of the buff-brick houses had wrought-iron trim around the windows and along the front steps . Ours was one of these . <p> The garage sat apart from the house , in the far corner of a small backyard . This garage was filled with my father 's things , his electric saw and worktable with its assortment of hammers , nails , screwdrivers , hacksaws , handsaws , drills , and odd tools I never knew the names for . There was no space left for the car . A black Ford , kept shiny and clean by my father , it sat in the driveway alongside my mother 's well-trimmed forsythia . <p> During the warm months , my father labored Saturdays in the yard , mowing and trimming and raking and seeding and fertilizing constantly  --  so it seemed to me  --  and our grass was thicker and greener than all our neighbors ' . In the cooler months , he went to the garage , kept the jigsaw whining , the sawdust thick in the air . He was skillful , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some deep , long-standing need to quarantine himself . For a time he made little cut-out figures , caricatures he had painstakingly traced from books and transferred to plywood-Dutch boys , hillbillies , cowboys , Old Black Joes , and Aunt Jemimas , which he then sanded , painted at last with brilliant colors , and attached to wrought-iron spikes so that they could be stuck in the ground as decoration for gardens and yards . A gardening supply store where my father bought his fertilizer took some of them on consignment , and a few actually sold , but one day  --  this would have been a summer several years before his illness  --  we saw him unloading them from the trunk of the car . There must have been a hundred of them . He installed a few in our yard and rested the others neatly in a corner of the garage . <p> From the age of ten , I was a paperboy , throwing the Daily Oklahoman in the mornings and the Oklahoma City Times in the afternoons . My route consisted of an area about fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city where graceful old mansions faced treelined streets . The trees , mostly sycamores and elms , were the tallest in the city , their intertwined branches making bowers pleasant to pass beneath in the early morning , the light just beginning to flicker through the fat , shiny leaves . Best of all , however , was the depth of the winter before daylight , the tall windows in the mansions still dark , the inhabitants warm in their big beds . I felt as if I owned the streets and the houses , and the life in them could not begin until I had thrown the last newspaper . <p> The residents of those fifty-year-old mansions I rarely saw . When I called for my monthly payment , servants dressed in black-and-white uniforms came to the door . I seldom saw a car at any of these houses , though they had broad asphalt driveways , brick-columned porticoes alongside the house for rainless , snowless departures and arrivals , and large garages in back , some with apartments above the stalls . Servants lived in these garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my family 's bungalow in Edgemere , my sisters shared one bedroom , and , after my father took to his bed , I shared the bunk beds in my bedroom with my mother . The small back room , the master bedroom , was scarcely big enough for a double bed . All the rooms had a decidedly cramped feel to them . My father did not , we were constantly reminded , make a lot of money working for OG &E.; Mother sold curtains and draperies at the uptown branch of Kerr 's , about a dozen blocks from our house . Until my father no longer needed the car , she walked to work every day . There must have been some disability insurance , sick pay from OG &E,; but this was not spoken of . My Oklahoman money , minus a small weekly allowance , went into my mother 's purse . <p> As I began my route on one of the coldest of winter mornings that year of my father 's dying , I saw a figure coming in my direction on the sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks . It was a woman , walking slowly in her high heels , as if afraid of slipping on a patch of ice . There was no ice , though a dusting of snow lay on the frozen lawns of the mansions . The woman wore a long coat with a fur collar . She did n't wear a hat , and her hair was whipped back and forth across her face by the wind . I took her to be my mother 's age , or a little younger . At the corner she looked up . That must have been when she saw me for the first time . She stopped abruptly , on the verge of stepping down from the curb into the street . I looked away and began to move again , taking the next folded paper from my bag . I was about a halfblock from the corner . After throwing the paper onto the next porch , I looked again for the woman and saw her walking away from me , rapidly , almost running . By the time I came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days that followed , I thought little of this near-meeting . I was in the eighth grade , in junior high school , and one of the first boys in my class to persuade a girl to wear his identification bracelet as a sign of love . I had plenty of distractions . In the evenings that we did not go to the hospital to visit my father , I worked hard to complete my assigned chore before my older sister Lila had done hers so that I could beat her to the phone and , in the half-hour allotted to me , listen to my girlfriend , a fast and furious talker , tell me about the day we had experienced more or less together . After that , I joined my younger sister Sandra in our small living room and sat with her before the television set , doing my homework during the commercials and low points in the programs . <p> Mother went to the hospital every evening , leaving just after supper and returning in time to tell us to brush our teeth and get ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Thursday evenings , and on Sunday afternoons . Because we had talked so little to him when he was in good health , conversation now seemed unnatural . Usually he was asleep , and we worked on our homework while our mother , with her chair pulled up close to his bed , read the latest Look or Life . <p> On some of the evenings when Mother went alone to the hospital , instead of calling my girlfriend or watching television I went back to my room , happy for the time alone there . I liked to read books that I had been given to understand were classics , The Count of Monte Cristo , 20,0000 Leagues under the Sea , The Call of the Wild , Riders of the Purple Sage . Now and then I was distracted from my reading by the sight of something of my mother 's that she 'd left hanging on the railing of the bunk bed or on top of the chest of drawers , a pair of nylon stockings or a blouse or underwear . I thought wistfully of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked to the end of the driveway and back . And I remembered the woman I 'd seen on my paper route , the way she 'd walked slowly in the high heels , the fur collar of her coat fluttering in the wind . It was almost as if I believed her to be the self I 'd left behind in the summer , the night-walker in my mother 's shoes . I hoped that I would see her again . <p> One evening I found a strange book on my desk . It was hardbound , black , and at first I thought it was a Bible . But when I picked it up I saw that its title was Cancer : A Guide . I sat down and read of a mystery in the blood , a secret born with birth itself , hidden in the dark reaches of gut and bone . I looked at illustrations that might have been of caverns , clouds , tunnels . Then , hearing the door of my father 's room open , I knew Mother was coming and so ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and bounded up onto the top bunk . I heard her go into the bathroom , and then , my eyes adjusted to the dark , I watched her come into my room , the curves of her body pressing against her flowing nightgown . She believed I was asleep and settled herself quietly in the lower bunk . It was a strange feeling , hearing her breathing . There was a little whimpering sound she made , almost as if she were crying , but it was n't the same and it never lasted long . <p> I rose well before her , sliding down from the bunk quietly . I liked seeing my mother sleeping . She slept on her side , facing the wall . It was comforting somehow , seeing her there , sleeping so soundly . <p> The book Cancer : A Guide appeared only that one evening and then disappeared . I guessed my mother must have left it there accidentally and had reclaimed it . <p> A few days after this , I saw the mysterious woman on my paper route as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a gray granite mansion . It was cold and clear , the sky still dark , and stars glimmered through the bare branches of the trees . I stepped behind an evergreen hedge and listened to the sound of her high heels tapping on the concrete . When she came to the end of the hedge she turned in my direction and I decided it best to start moving again . We almost collided . <p> She towered over me . Light from the streetlamp made her face very white . I had surely misjudged her age . She must have been closer in years to my older sister than my mother , though certainly no teenager . There was anger in her eyes , but she looked at me for only an instant before spinning around and stepping quickly back towards the garage . Unaccountably , I stayed there watching her . She wore the furcollared coat , black patent-leather high heels , and carried a large black purse strapped over her shoulder . The coat looked gray in that dim light , the fur collar a dull yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the garage apartment , she looked back , though only for an instant , before hurriedly ascending . Now I saw something other than anger in her quick look . I imagined it was a sense of longing , of complicity , and I felt a powerful desire to follow her . But she was gone , and no lights shone from the apartment 's windows . <p> I began to dream of her all day , picturing her as she paused at the foot of the stairs . In my mind I followed her , rose with her into a room dark like the caverns I 'd seen in my mother 's secret book of cancer . <p> What 's wrong with you , my girlfriend asked during lunch in the cafeteria . Is your father ... worse ? <p> He was not worse , I said with some vehemence , believing I spoke the truth , for had n't he always had this sickness in his blood ? <p> She picked up her tray and left . At the end of the day she pressed into my palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mornings among the dark mansions , the thick trunks of the sycamores , the webbed branches , and the last of the winter night sky . The woman I stalked was not , I told myself , my secret sickness , my birthright , not the mystery that lay ready to devour me , body and soul . She was a mystery , yes , a riddle , but restorative , luxuriant , lavishly life-giving . <p> Mercy Hospital was a three-story white stucco building shaped like a U. The Sisters of Mercy , in their old-fashioned black habits , their strange white hats with the upswept , pointed brims , stood behind the reception desk and patrolled the hallways . Watching one of them drift past in the hallway , I imagined her as a young girl , packing away dozens of dresses to be sent to the Salvation Army , then cutting off all her beautiful long hair , shaving her head smooth . It was a peculiarly romantic notion . <p> We were not Catholics . Mercy Hospital was less expensive than others and closer to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Baptist Church for Christmas and Easter services , but we belonged to no church . <p> One evening when we entered my father 's hospital room , we saw a nun standing alongside his bed , hovering over him . She was tall , and the way she leaned forward you could see her thin ankles and the backs of her well-worn mannish shoes . <p> Mother motioned for my sisters and me to wait outside . <p> They 're converting him , Lila said as we waited in the hallway . That 's why they let him in here in the first place , so they can take advantage of him and make him a Catholic . <p> Mother wo n't let them do that , Sandra said . <p> I agreed with Sandra . <p> Maybe something 's wrong , I said . <p> Brilliant , Einstein , Lila said . <p> A chubby , red-faced nun came up to us and asked if she might help us find somebody . <p> He 's in there , Lila said harshly . <p> The nun smiled sweetly and glided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes clear and blue , and she had looked at me , I thought , with interest . <p> Mother appeared , gestured for us to come back into the room . The tall nun stood alongside our father 's bed , pale and still in her black shoes . <p> I 'm Sister Luke , she said with a pleasant smile . Please come over here . <p> We had advanced to the center of the room . Mother hung back at the doorway . On the other side of the room , by the windows , my father 's roommate lay on his side with the sheets pulled over his head . My father was propped up in bed , but his eyes were closed . No one had shaved him , and the bristles on his cheeks were white and shimmery . <p> Your father wants to say something to you , Sister Luke said . You 'll have to come closer , though . <p> My sisters , always less ready to obey , stayed where they were , but I did as the nun said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand grasped my father 's hand and placed it in mine . His hand was cold . It felt light as a feather . He looked at the nun and then at me . <p> Son ? he said . <p> It 's your son , Mr. Smalley , the nun said . Do you want your glasses on ? <p> He began to pull on my hand , as if to raise himself up . <p> He wants to hug you , the nun said to me . <p> I love you , Larry , my father said as I leaned down to receive his embrace . He held me tight , pressing his bristly cheek against mine . When he let go , the nun called for my sisters , who approached him together , as if afraid to go alone . After pulling each of them down into his embrace and professing his love , he sighed heavily and looked at the nun . <p> There , now , she said , that did n't hurt at all , did it . <p> The morning after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the garage apartment . The curtains were pulled back , and I could see the blank gray of the ceiling . In a little while I saw the woman herself . Staring out into darkness from inside a lighted room , she could not have seen me , but I jumped back behind the hedge that had hidden us from each other the day before and waited a few seconds before daring to peek around it . <p> The light in the window had gone out and she was coming down the stairs . At least I thought I saw her . It was dark , and I did not wait around . I heard the tapping of her heels , but kept my eyes trained on the darkness ahead . <p> I began to get up earlier and ride my bike straight to the mansion before picking up the morning papers . I stood the bike behind the hedge and crept along the driveway towards the garage apartment . Sometimes the light in the window was on , sometimes not , but even through the darkened panes I imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human form , became a woman , possibly more than one woman . Once she came to the window in a white dress , stood there for what seemed a long time . Another time she appeared in bright red . <p> Days grew longer , warmer . By the time I came to the end of my paper route , the morning darkness was a faint , rosy grayness . Buds began to swell and glisten at the extremities of the sycamore branches . My father was home again , again in his bed in the corner bedroom . At last we were told he had cancer . But we must never lose hope . Mother bought him a new pair of pajamas made of a lustrous royal-blue material that she must have thought cheerful , but its brilliancy made him look paler than ever . We visited him in the evenings just as when he was in the hospital , entering his room one at a time , Lila first , then me , then Sandra , and sat out our time in a metal folding chair by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his love again , nor pull me to him for a hug . Most of the time he was sleeping , even when propped up , his head hanging to one side and his mouth open . <p> When it came time to collect at the mansion belonging to the garage apartment , I stood in the bright and broad hallway and gazed at a grand blue-carpeted staircase with white banisters . At the staircase landing a pair of tall , deep-set windows rose up , their white curtains held in place along the sides by a thick golden rope . The air smelled clean and dry . <p> A few times while waiting , I walked softly and swiftly to the staircase , clasped the smooth banister , and took several steps up , my heart beating wildly , my breath quickening . How easy to continue , climb first to the landing , turn , then ascend the remaining steps to the upper rooms . But , only slightly out of breath , I was back in position near the front door by the time the servant , none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days passed in a blur . I did enough schoolwork to get by , neither failing nor excelling , and I was friendly enough only to keep from being considered odd , without . inviting confidence . My teachers remembered Lila , a poor student , frequently in trouble for passing notes or talking in class , and they must have found my mild and quiet diligence a relief . <p> My father lay in his bed , thin and pale in his blue pajamas . I studied his nose , the blunt tip , the dark hairs extending from his nostrils . Mother did n't have time to shave him daily , and I could see the silver bristles on his cheeks . His fingernails had grown as long as a woman 's . <p> His life was a mystery to me . I knew his birthday , June 19 , 1914 . I knew he had been born in Stillwater , where his father once owned a small grocery store near the college . He did not attend college . He was twenty-four years old when he married my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . This would have been in Oklahoma City . They met , I always understood , on a blind date . There was an older halfbrother , Uncle Ferris , in insurance out in the Texas Panhandle , who sent a Christmas card every year . My father 's father died of natural causes a few years after my birth , and his mother , my grandmother , lived with a sister in Tulsa . I had been only a few times to the office where my father worked . ! remembered it as a large gray room with dozens of desks , a big black typewriter on each desk , fluorescent lights hung from chains all along the ceiling . My father 's desk looked like all the others . <p> I told my mother I did not want to visit my father again . It was a waste of time , since for all I could tell he neither knew nor cared whether I was there or not . I would go again when he was awake , when he recognized me . <p> If he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great pain . <p> If I did as I wanted , she said , I would regret it the rest of my life . <p> One early spring morning as I reached for my shoes in the dark closet , my hand happened to fall upon something silky . It was one of my mother 's slips , and , on an impulse that I did not stop to question , I held it up before me . It would fit me , I thought . Just as her shoes fit me so well last summer , this slip would fit me now . <p> She was breathing deeply , sound asleep in my bottom bunk . It was still dark outside , dark in the room . There was no rush to get ready . I had been rising a good hour and a half earlier than I needed to in order to put in my time at the apartment window . In a jiffy , I took off my shirt and jeans and , after a moment 's hesitation , my underwear too . I then tiptoed back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the railing at the foot of the bunk bed , and returned with them to the closet . Listening closely for signs of a change in her breathing and hearing only the same steady rhythm as before , I stepped quickly into the panties , thrilled by the strange smoothness , and then pulled the slip up until I could get my hands through the straps . I rolled up a pair of my socks and tucked them in the spaces for breasts . The fit was fine , as I had hoped . If only I had her shoes , the pretty sling pumps I 'd worn last summer . And a dress . Why should n't I wear a dress ? <p> I tiptoed back into the room . Sometimes she left her shoes under the bed , but this time she had n't . Nor had she left her dress on the doorknob . I might find a dress , or a skirt and blouse , in the bathroom dirty clothes hamper , but of course there would be no shoes in there . I had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of my father , saw in my mind 's eye the blunt nose , the wiry hair in his nostrils , the long fingernails , his open mouth sucking in the air . What if he woke at night , what if these were his waking hours , and I found him wide-eyed , lucid in his wonderful blue pajamas , staring at me ? It could not be so , I decided . He was sick . Medicine would keep him in a deep , deep sleep . <p> I stepped out into the hallway . My sisters ' bedroom was directly across from mine , the door open . I heard deep breathing , a small whimpering sound like the one my mother made sometimes . I might have gone in their room after one of Lila 's dresses , but it seemed more likely that Sandra or Lila would wake up than our father . <p> I had no more than an hour , I figured , until the : darkness would begin to give way to morning light . Quickly then , I approached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I shut it behind me , stood dead still , one hand on the doorknob . I could hear my father 's breathing and the ticking of the clock on his nightstand . The air smelled stale , almost sour . <p> His bed was in the corner of the room , placed so that he slept facing the door , with the windows behind him . Just inside the door , to my right , was the chest of drawers , and on my left , no more than six feet from my father 's bed , the closet . I knew all this by memory , but I could see well enough , after a few seconds , to take it all in . How was it that this darkness was so transparent ? His blinds were pulled up , he never wanted them down . That might have accounted for it . Would the moon still have shone at that early hour of the morning ? Light from a streetlamp ? I saw him clearly , clearer than I wanted to . His head was turned towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right at me . <p> But I saw no sign of recognition in his eyes . Could he be asleep with his eyes open ? His face , even with the mouth closed , looked as expressionless as when he slept . I held my breath , froze , not taking my eyes off him . Something suddenly flashed forth from his eyes . I never saw anything like it . It must have been pain , it might have been terror . It lasted only a second . Then his eyes squeezed shut . <p> I prayed that they might stay shut , even if it meant he was dead . God have mercy , I wanted that dress , those shoes . <p> The eyes did stay shut , the mouth dropped open , the blue pajamas shimmered in the filmy dark . He began to snore softly . <p> At the closet I took the first dress I touched , then leaned down and found my mother 's high heels . In the bathroom I stepped into the dress . It went on smooth over the slip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother , and I smoothed the bodice , the skirt , looked at the dark image of myself in the mirror , the breasts rising the way they were supposed to , the dainty collar trimmed with lace . Then I eased my feet into the high-heeled shoes and when I stood up I had my balance . <p> I had to watch my step . There were no carpets in our halls and in spots the floor was likely to creak . I kept to one side , on tiptoe , glad of my last summer 's practice in wearing high heels . Once in the kitchen , I crossed directly to the back door , unlocked it , opened it as quietly as I could . Then I stepped out into the last of the darkness . <p> Such a strange , fearsome elation ! The leaves on the frail mimosa tree in our backyard looked burnished and lush , the grass glistened , the black Ford sat in the driveway , gleaming and terrible and monumental . I stayed on the grass , the high and narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the ground , the tapered skirt brushing against my shins , the smooth slip cool across my knees , but even as I stepped around the Ford , letting my fingers graze the cold steel , I knew that I was not going to stop when I came to the end of the yard . This was different from last summer . A lovely , dangerous world lay before me , a universe secret and dark and forever . Edgemere ! The whirring cicadas might have been the rustling wings of angels  --  I did not stop to think whether fallen or not . There must have been a chill in the air , but I did not feel cold . <p> The little houses sat hunched and still , the street curved gently down to the park , and every step took me deeper into the mystery of myself . The high heels resounded on the concrete . I let them sing out . I did n't look back . Ahead of me the trees of the park swayed and shook , as if sweeping the sky of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down into that beautiful darkness . <p> And that is where I went . That is where I wanted to stay . <p> When the school year ended , my sisters and I were shamed into helping with the care for my father . Sandra and Lila shaved him and I helped Mother bathe him . She showed me the tube that curled from his penis into a bag beneath the bed , and how to empty the bag and change it . During this last phase , Mother grew more lively and cheerful , a change I attributed to our aid , but it may simply have been relief in knowing that the end was near . At any rate , I felt good about helping my mother , and , unlike my sisters , was not disgusted by my father . He seemed to me more like a great raggedy doll than the grim and distant father I 'd known , who in my mind was already dead , might have died the moment he 'd seen me coming into his room in search of my mother 's dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to frighten me . I grew fond of him . <p> At the funeral , a Baptist minister obtained by the funeral home spoke of God 's love and the sacrifice of His only begotten son . He went on and on . My father , dressed in his gray business suit , lay in front of the altar in a copper-colored coffin with beige satin lining . I had gone with my mother to choose it , an economy model more sturdy than beautiful . My grandmother and her sister , white-haired ladies with canes , and Uncle Ferris , the half-brother from the Texas Panhandle , accompanied by a woman whose platinum-blond hair fairly glowed from beneath a tiny black pillbox hat and veil , sat alongside us in the family mourning area , a booth hidden from the other viewers by shaded glass . In the chapel proper a few people sat scattered about , a neighbor or two , some fellow workers at OG &E,; I supposed . <p> Way out on the far north side of the city , the cemetery had almost no trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great aunt wore black stiff-looking dresses . My mother wore navy blue , not the dress I 'd worn , but the shoes were the same . She had tied a black scarf around her hair and bought black scarves or my sisters , a black clip-on bow tie for me . I heard Uncle Ferris tell Mother that it was a shame the way lives drift apart . He was holding the blond woman 's hand , and she pressed her other hand down on top of her little pillbox hat while the wind kept lifting its black net veil . <p> The woman in the window never undressed before me , understand . This was no striptease . Nor did I hope for one . If it was myself I looked for , saw , desired , then it was enough to see her in full regalia , just like me , in my own way , when I circled Edgemere Park in my mother 's shoes , a soft spring breeze pressing the skirt against my legs . <p> After my father 's death , when I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman 's window , I began to feel afraid-not of being discovered , it was more as if I feared not being discovered . Even when this modest fear became purer , more general , more intense , as it shortly did , I kept up the ritual . It became a test of my courage . <p> Then one morning a man appeared in the window . I drew back , thinking him my father . He was thin , stark naked , his body very white , hairless , the penis thick and risen . Turning away from the window , I saw him leaving the apartment , dressed now in a gray suit like the one my father was buried in , his black shoes shining . I ran to the station house , certain that he followed me , but he did not . <p> In a dream , my father wanted to tell me something , something important , but he could not say it , and I woke with tears flooding my eyes , with the keen sense that he had been here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed by restlessness . It was only two o'clock , but I rose , made my way through the dark house to the back bedroom . I had no illusion that my father would be there . At first I thought my mother might not be asleep , and I waited behind the door , listening for sounds . But it was very quiet in there . When at last I thought it safe enough to peek around the door , I could see nothing at all . I stepped inside , stark naked , silent in my bare feet on the smooth planks of the floor ; and made my way to the closet by touch . Then I stood very still until my eyes adjusted to the dark . My mother slept to one side of the bed , facing the wall . A breeze blew through the open window and the air smelled clean and fresh . She had scrubbed the room top to bottom and put up lacy curtains . <p> I dressed in the garage . When I was halfway to the park , a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The car drove past without slowing down . It was not a police car , but I was badly frightened . I had certainly been seen , and would n't I be reported now as a prowler , a peeping Tom ? I took off the heels and began to run back to the house , hitching up the tight skirt above my knees . <p> A light was on in the kitchen window . I crept up to it and peeked in . My mother sat at the kitchen table in her robe . She smoked a cigarette and sipped from a coffee cup . <p> I slipped back to the garage , took off the skirt , the blouse , and hung them carefully on my bicycle handlebars . It would have been smart , I realized , to have brought a change of clothes with me to the garage . Mother might not have missed me . Something else had awakened her . She would not have thought to check my room . Restored to jeans and T-shirt , I could wait until daybreak , throw my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing out of the ordinary had happened . She would not miss the clothes , she had other skirts , other shoes , and there would be plenty of time after she had gone to work for me to return what I 'd taken . <p> Then I saw the row of paper sacks and remembered : my father 's clothes . She had set the sacks out in the hall and asked me to carry them to the garage , six of them altogether . I had leaned them against the closed door alongside the unsold yard ornaments , and now I went to them and found a shirt , a pair of slacks , a belt . Nothing fit , but I rolled up the trouser cuffs , the sleeves of the white shirt , pulled the belt in as tight as I could . It was not the same as wearing my mother 's clothes . There was no transformation . I felt foolish . <p> But I could ride my bicycle in them , and that is what I did , placing my mother 's clothes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike to the edge of the driveway before jumping onto it and pumping as though my life depended on it . The loose-fitting trousers flapped in the wind like flags . I rode without thought of destination , whipping around the park and onto dark side streets . I wanted only to be far away from that house , far from the light of that window , that kitchen where my mother sat in a haze of cigarette smoke , making her way back from the dream that had awakened her , a dream like my own , I imagined , a dream of my father . <p> Then I came to the streets lined with tall trees and dark mansions . Out of breath , my legs aching , I stopped , dismounted at the driveway that led to the garage apartment . There was no light in that window , but I waited , sitting on my knees in the grass beside the hedge . After a while , rested , I took my mother 's clothes from the bike basket and put them on again . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . I had an image of my mother doing the same thing , folding one shirt after another , the white shirts he 'd worn to work , the useless socks , the absurd ties , ' the boxer shorts . Still the sacks filled up , six of them . And then . there was no more and she stopped , she looked into the closet , she closed and opened the empty drawers . What was I looking for ? What did I imagine I would find there ? The sadness of these questions overwhelmed me . I sobbed furiously . Then I stopped . <p> He is not here , I told myself , my father is dead and I am not my mother . <p> I stepped away from the hedge , took a deep breath , walked up to the front door of the mansion . The bell rang out so loud I was sure that all the world heard it . But nobody answered . I rang it again and again but nobody answered . I tried the door . Locked , naturally . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , passed through the brick-columned portico , my mother 's shoes clicking on the asphalt driveway , and then I stood poised at the steps that led up to the entrance of the garage apartment , my hand on the cool wrought-iron railing . I hesitated only a moment before ascending . The night air was warm and sweet . The trees seemed to whisper , every breeze-touched leaf a tongue . I understood that secret language . It spoke of my beauty . Each step I took seemed further proof of it , a beauty born of my own grief , of a sorrowfully personal mortality . To live was no more than a fatal birthright . The miracle lay curled in the blood alongside the calamity . <p> I reached the door , knocked loudly , waited , knocked again . No light , no sound . I tried opening the door . Like the other , it was firmly locked . No one would open it , no one was inside . The realization seemed final , absolute . <p> I turned away and knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time I stepped back inside my parents ' house , but everyone was sound asleep . I had plenty of time to change into my own clothes , ride again to the mansions and deliver the morning newspapers . <p> What else is there , after all , but to go back to the small , safe houses of our mothers and fathers , rest ourselves as long as we can in that sad clarity , that somber , subduing light ? We live on the edge of a fathomless dark sea . No mansion on earth can contain us . <p> All the rest of that long summer of my fourteenth year , day broke in our house as naturally as sin . In the garage , awaiting the Salvation Army , the row of paper bags filled with my father 's clothes sat next to the stacks of his toothless hillbillies , his grinning Aunt Jemimas . Inside the house , my mother rested nightly in the bedroom my father had occupied , and my sisters , dead to the world , afloat in their own dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Son and brother , I vowed to stay with them . You 're the man of the house now , my mother kept saying , and so I was . <p> <p> By ROBERT LOVE TAYLOR <p>
