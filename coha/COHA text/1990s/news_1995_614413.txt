<p> Seventeen months after saying goodbye , Michael Jordan embraced one of life 's most enduring truisms . Never say never . In monthly increments hastened by baseball 's labor troubles , the Chicago Bulls superstar discovered that he missed basketball almost as much as the NBA missed him . ALMOST . Any questions about Jordan 's popularity should have been dispelled this past week , as a crush of media members tracked his footsteps in Indianapolis , Boston , and finally in Chicago for Friday 's dramatic United Center debut against the Orlando Magic . Along the way there were cheers and tears , rivalries revisited , acquaintances renewed , and the promise of better days ahead . As chronicled by the Journal- Constitution 's Ailene Voisin , here 's a closer look at Jordan and how he enjoyed/endured seven days that captivated the country . <p> Saturday : ' I 'm back ' message sends media on scavenger hunt <p> As the Bulls prepare to conclude their morning practice , an air of anticipation permeates the press quarters . Will this be the day Jordan makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will he finally put an end to the relentless - and often ridiculous - speculation ? <p> No . But about the time he darts out of the gym and into his Mercedes , Jordan 's agent releases the official announcement . " I 'm back , " it says , simply . Jordan will end his 21-month layoff against the Indiana Pacers Sunday in an NBC telecast from Market Square Arena . <p> As members of the media scavenge for every Michael morsel , Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf tells the Chicago Tribune his superstar is here to stay . " Judging by his enthusiasm and the way he sounds , three or four years , " says the owner . " Who knows in life anymore ? I might choke on this cigar I 'm smoking , and never get to watch him play another minute . " <p> As the news reaches Indianapolis , fans begin staking out the Canterbury Hotel , where the Bulls will stay . Pacers publicist Dave Benner rushes to his office and prepares for the barrage of credential requests . The phone lines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another 65 calls on his answering machine . <p> " This is unbelievable , " the publicist moans . " There 's no way we can accommodate everyone . This is a nightmare . " <p> Yet most of the Bulls sleep peacefully in their downtown Indianapolis hotel Saturday night , while their absent teammate rests comfortably in his suburban Chicago home , with plans to take a private flight in the morning . <p> The moment awaits . So do the Pacers . Sunday : Anticipation high at Indianapolis return <p> The coverage is even more extensive than anticipated . Both Chicago dailies include special sections , and the Bulls star is featured on the front pages of the Indianapolis newspapers as well . Closer to Market Square Arena , television trucks crowd an adjacent parking lot . Radio crews and print journalists begin arriving two hours before the noon tipoff - well after Jordan 's jet lands and he is escorted to the arena . Dressed in sweats and a sleeveless white T-shirt , the 6-foot-6 guard is on the court warming up before 9 a.m . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though most are " Pacer People , " as the hometown fans are known , almost all appear to be Jordan fans . Signs endorse his return . Jerseys and T-shirts with his number ( 23 before and 45 after ) are numerous . And inside , the atmosphere is steamy with anticipation . <p> " Is this incredible ? " remarks Pacers general manager Donnie Walsh , as Shelly Brown , wife of Pacers coach Larry Brown , wanders over with 8- month-old son , L.J . <p> " What 's Larry think of all this ? " Walsh asks . <p> " He thinks it 's great , " she responds , " But the phone calls are driving us crazy . Suddenly everybody 's our good friend . They all want tickets . Larry finally shut the answer machine off . " <p> Walsh laughs . Later , as Jordan and Scottie Pippen ignite a late rally , he squirms in his courtside seat . This is too familiar . Jordan stealing passes . Jordan drilling jumpers . Jordan being Jordan . The tongue , the fury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacers prevail in overtime , sending reporters scurrying for seats in a jam-packed press room where Jordan promises to speak . <p> Showered and impeccably dressed in a gray suit , he appears 10 minutes later and stares into the crowd . Familiar faces , new faces , many , many faces . He seems surprised and somewhat embarrassed , at times even humble . " I 'm not a god , " he reminds , after making just 7 of 28 shots . But he has his own surprises . <p> After sharing thoughts on his return and his goals , Jordan addresses the league 's image problems and the questionable behavior of some of the emerging young stars . " You see it , you see it , " he says . Then sounding much like Magic Johnson , even a little like the once-reluctant Larry Bird , Jordan vows to assume the leadership in restoring the league 's credibility . " You do n't disrespect the game , " he insists . <p> Monday : Chicago to China , ' Michael Mania ' goes global <p> Michael Mania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 45 . The managers of Michael Jordan 's Restaurant in Chicago still are calculating profits , said almost to have doubled over the weekend . The media craze now spans the globe . The Chicago Tribune runs a front page fan-reaction story from Beijing , China . The Bulls , meanwhile , seek refuge in their practice digs in the suburbs . <p> Some apparently have had enough . Coach Phil Jackson hides in his office after the morning session , outlasting members of the national press who disperse after an hour . Pippen continues his months-long interview ban , and is joined by Toni Kukoc , said to be upset about his poor performance against the Pacers . B.J. Armstrong , Luc Longley , Steve Kerr , Pete Myers and most of the other Bulls join Jordan for another 30- minute informal session and further revelations : Jordan says his agent , David Falk , and the Bulls owner urged him to delay his comeback until next season . " But I said this would give us a psychological edge this year , " he says . " Eighty-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my game . Now it kind of takes a team by surprise . " <p> Tuesday : Thrust into maelstrom upon return to Boston Garden <p> After practice and before the Bulls travel to Boston , Jackson allows that Jordan 's jump shot remains off-rhythm , but calls the session " spirited . " He also announces plans to keep Kukoc in the starting lineup , though conceding the 6-11 forward is out of position at power forward . Jordan this time retreats to the training room . The door opens occasionally and the superstar can be seen seated in front of a television , apparently intent on the O.J. Simpson trial . Robert Shapiro 's measured tone can be heard in the background . <p> The charter flight to Boston leaves at 5 p.m. , and upon landing , the Bulls are thrust into a maelstrom . Festivities to honor the late Celtics star Reggie Lewis at halftime of the Bulls-Celts game are clouded by allegations of cocaine abuse as a possible cause of Lewis ' death . The once-proud organization is buckling at the knees , seemingly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ( 77 ) to serve as savior , and its most popular superstar too infirm ( bad back ) for any late-season rescues . <p> A nattily dressed Larry Bird instead spends the evening at a reception at Northeastern University , defending his late teammate and the organization 's plans to retire Lewis ' No. 35 jersey . Bird at times seems angry . Reggie deserves better , he says . <p> Wednesday : Standing ovation , cheers recall grand moments <p> A final appearance in Boston Garden . Jordan , who usually plays well here , receives a thunderous standing ovation during introductions and lusty cheers throughout . As he drains jumpers , darts baseline , tosses a no-look pass to Pippen , and finally dunks off an alley-oop pass , the Celtics faithful respond approvingly , as if he were a Celtic son . <p> Jordan , in fact , elicits more genuine affection than the uneasy halftime ceremonies honoring Lewis . Emotions obviously are mixed - some believing Lewis undeserving of the tribute based on his play , others troubled by the drug allegations . Auerbach quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give the deceased star a fitting Celtic farewell . The applause is seldom rousing , seeming mostly obligatory . <p> When play resumes 34 minutes later , Jordan and Pippen combine quickly on an alley-oop , and No. 45 scores his first official dunk . After scoring 27 points in 26 minutes , Jordan tells the press he will miss the old Garden , soon to fall victim to the wrecking ball . He recalls grand moments , lots of trash talking from Bird , the impassioned crowds . " This is home , " he says , before leaving for the airport . <p> Down the hall , Bird chats with journalists in the Celtics locker room . His face crimson from the Florida sun , he jokingly vows to leave the comebacks to others , including You-Know-Who , and claims to stay busy with a combination of scouting duties , speaking engagements and endorsements . Someone muses that it was good to see Jordan playing again , and playing well . Bird nods . " Hey , I 'm glad he came back , too , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pause . <p> " The league needs him , " Bird adds quietly . " It is n't the same anymore , is it ? " <p> Thursday : Chicago feels warmth of Prodigal Bull 's return home <p> The Chicago air is cool and dark clouds hover overhead , yet nothing can chill the warmth enveloping the city . Mere hours remain before the Prodigal Bull comes home . Jordan again dominates the news , is perhaps the only man capable of upstaging Shaquille O'Neal . And what will Jordan think of Penny Hardaway ? Of the $ 175 million arena ? Will the rims be kind ? Will he be overcome by the crowd 's affection ? " ( Jordan ) was hitting his shots , " says Jackson , after Jordan 's inaugural practice at United Center . " He was in an upbeat mood . " <p> One more night . Friday : After all the hoops hype , finally , it 's game time in Chicago <p> More special sections . More hype . Is there no escape ? The offerings have consisted of everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Jordan can improve his shooting touch ( by strengthening the flexor and extensor muscles ) , to a two-page map enumerating " His Highness ' Hot Spots " in the Sun-Times . <p> But the only place to be on this night is the United Center for the Homecoming . <p> Finally . <p> Jordan arrives about 2:30 and shoots around . The local television stations begin offering spots from the empty arena not long afterward . A Bulls publicist says 350 media credentials have been distributed ; the Before Michael figure is closer to 75 . <p> Most of the Magic players begin arriving at 5:45 , and while Shaq is n't eager to talk , a large contingent gathers around Hardaway , who obliges . <p> He recalls his disappointment when Jordan retired , then grins . " But then I thought , ' Maybe in another lifetime I 'll get to play him , ' " he says , shaking his head . Everyone laughs . Dennis Scott , seated nearby , wonders about the crowd . " We just have to get past the first few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta play . " <p> The fans rush in at 6 . Finally , at 7:23 , Michael steps onto the court to a thunderous ovation , the rumors , the speculation , the anticipation , all now part of Bulls lore . <p> So is this .
