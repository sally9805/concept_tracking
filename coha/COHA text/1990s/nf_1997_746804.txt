Section : Geology The Making of the Grand Canyon <p> " We have no difficulty as we float along , and I am able to observe the wonderful phenomena connected with this flood of lava . The canyon was doubtless filled to a height of 1,2000 to 1,500 feet , perhaps by more than one flood . This would dam the water back ; and in cutting through this great lava bed , a new channel has been formed , sometimes on one side , sometimes on the other . . . . What a conflict of water and fire there must have been here ! Just imagine a river of melted snow . What a seething and boiling of waters ; what clouds of steam rolled into heavens ! John Wesley Powell ( August 25 , 1869 ) Story by W. K. Hamblin and Laura Hamblin <p> <p> John Wesley Powell first viewed the remnants of basalt lava adhering to the walls of the inner gorge in the western Grand Canyon more than a hundred years ago . Yet today this awesome record of relatively recent volcanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago  --  remains largely unknown . Each year , nearly five million tourists , approaching the canyon 's northern and southern rims near the visitor centers , marvel at the two-billion-year geological record in the exposed rock and at the river 's ability to erode a canyon one mile deep . Few are aware that ninety miles to the west  --  in the Toroweap section  --  lies an unparalleled scene of volcanic phenomena : a cycle of lava dam formation and destruction that is the most significant event in the recent history of the Grand Canyon . Where else in the world is there so much for a geologist to contemplate ? Certainly , no record of volcanism is to be viewed in a more dramatic and inspiring setting . <p> Quiet and stark , the remote Toroweap area is accessible only by sixty-odd miles of rough gravel roads from Saint George or Kanab , Utah . Here , the walls of the inner gorge climb 3,000 feet straight up from the river to the Esplanade Platform , from which the outer rim rises another 2,000 feet . Within this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces that shape our planet . The walls of the deep canyon expose a sequence of Paleozoic strata a mile thick . Major faults are clear and distinct . Extinct volcanoes dot the landscape . Some perch on the rim of the inner gorge ; remnants of others cling precariously to the walls like stranded rock climbers ; eventually erosion will cause these remnants to slip off . Black falls of " frozen " lava cascade from the canyon rim to the river almost 5,000 feet below . Right on the rim of the inner gorge at the mouth of Toroweap Canyon , Vulcan 's Throne , a 600-foot cinder cone , stands sentry over it all . <p> One remarkable manifestation of volcanism can be best appreciated from river level . It is Vulcan 's Forge , a massive rock pipe through which lava once worked its way to the surface . Situated in the very middle of the river , it rises sixty to seventy feet above the water . But from the canyon rim , it appears to be only a black speck . Numerous dikes cut through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface . The most significant features , however , are the huge , vertical slabs of black basalt stacked side by side against the canyon wars . These are what is left of a series of ancient lava dams that once blocked the Colorado River and caused huge lakes to form in the Grand Canyon upstream . ( Basalt is the most common and most fluid type of lava , and the one most often produced where tectonic plates split and move apart . ) <p> A view from the air gives us a superb perspective from which to understand the recent volcanic activity in the western Grand Canyon . The canyon cuts across the southern margins of the Uinkaret field , a relatively small volcanic field in northern Arizona that has been the site of repeated eruptions during the last two to three million years . Numerous eruptions that occurred near the edge of the field have spilled lava into the Grand Canyon and tributary canyons , such as Toroweap , Whitmore , and Prospect . ( Other volcanoes have erupted deep within the canyon . ) Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet high , roughly ten times higher than most of the great waterfalls of the world ( compare Niagara Falls at 160 feet , Iguacu Falls at about 210 feet , or Victoria Falls at 350 to 400 feet ) . But the lava cascades tell only part of the story . <p> Between 1965 and 1992 , with colleagues from the geology department at Brigham Young University , we studied this region along the river , eventually using helicopters to study features hidden from view at river level and enlisting a professional mountain climber to collect samples from high cliffs . Our studies show that during thirteen major periods of eruption within approximately one million years , more than 150 lava flows poured into the canyon . Each major eruption created a lava dam within the narrow confines of the inner gorge , causing the Colorado River to form a large lake extending far upstream . <p> From the sequence of basalts preserved in the inner gorge , we clearly see that four different types of dams formed during the major periods of volcanic activity . Unlike their human  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick lava flows that extended for miles downstream . The first lava dams  --  more than one million years old  --  were built from several huge , massive flows , each more than 500 feet thick and ten to twenty miles long . Reaching a cumulative height of as much as 2,000 feet , these probably were the highest dams ever in the Grand Canyon . <p> The next dams were formed by the rapid accumulation of numerous thin lava flows that were fifteen to twenty feet thick . But the Colorado River immediately overflowed these low barriers , depositing gravel and sand . Further eruptions rapidly followed , and soon a multitude of thin flows , inter layered with river gravels , created large , complex dams that were as much as eight miles long . <p> A third type of dam was formed by a series of six to eight lava flows , each one 50 to 200 feet thick . Such dams were built over extended periods  --  from 100 to 1,000 years  --  so that each lava flow was partly eroded before the next flow covered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most recently  --  within the past 500,000 years  --  volcanic eruptions constructed dams with single flows 200 to 600 feet thick . What is remarkable about these youngest dams is how far downstream they extended . We can trace the remnants of one recent dam from the Toroweap section to Lake Mead , a distance of more than eighty-five miles . <p> The formation of each lava dam significantly and dramaticaly changed the Grand Canyon . Yet , apart from one type of dam that could take up to 1,000 years to form , most were formed in a remarkably short time . Observations of basaltic eruptions in Iceland , Hawaii , and elsewhere indicate that a lava flow tens of miles long can form in a matter of days or weeks . The 1783 eruption of Lakagicar , in Iceland , for example , built a dam 40 miles long and 540 feet high in only a month . Undoubtedly , lava dams in the Grand Canyon formed in a similar manner . Still , the formation of the dams is only half the story ; the other half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes of erosion began immediately after water overflowed a lava dam : one was the cutting of a new canyon by normal erosion of the river ; the second was the upstream migration of waterfalls . With the rate of waterfall migration well documented for many contemporary rivers , we have probable time frames for the destruction of the dams . Niagara Falls , for example , has migrated headward at a rate of three feet a year . At that rate , a lava dam in the Grand Canyon could have been completely destroyed in less than 20,000 years by waterfall migration alone . From detailed studies of rivers that have been modified by lava flows , we know that waterfalls form at the downstream end of the flow and rapidly migrate upstream , creating higher and higher waterfall toward the crest of the dam . <p> Erosion of the highest lava dam must have presented a spectacular scene ; the highest waterfalls may have been more than 2,000 feet high , with a discharge of 135,000 cubic meters per second , making them possibly the largest ever formed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher than 160-foot-tall Niagara Falls . Then , as the falls migrated headward , the dams collapsed . At a critical point , some of them may have failed in a single catastrophic event . Such a catastrophe would have produced a rapid , tremendous discharge of the water and saturated mud that had accumulated in the lake upstream . <p> The silting up of the lakes that formed behind the lava dams is another important element in their history . The lakes were similar to the reservoirs that now exist behind the artificial Hoover and Glen Canyon dams . However , the highest lava dam created a lake larger than Lake Mead and Lake Powell combined . One million years ago , it extended upstream from Toroweap through the Grand Canyon and ( through what is now Lake Powell ) beyond Moab , Utah  --  a distance of more than four hundred miles . Remnants of sand , gravel , and silt deposits from this and other lakes are found throughout the Grand Canyon and above the present shores of Lake Powell . <p> An exceptionally large deposit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyon located a few miles upstream from Toroweap , is a microcosm of the entire Grand Canyon as it was when the lakes were full of sediment , just before the destruction of the lava dams . Lake deposits fill much of Havasu Canyon to an elevation of 3,195 feet , forming a broad , flat surface two and a half miles long and a quarter of a mile wide . Calcium carbonate from Havasu Creek formed a protective cover for the deep , rich sediments of the lake bed , which have permitted the Havasupai Indians to farm self-sufficiently for hundreds of years in an isolated and protected Shangri-La . <p> The Bureau of Reclamation has for many years measured the volume of sediment carried by the Colorado River . These data indicate that a 200-foot-deep lake would fill with mud and silt in two to three years ; a lake 1,000 feet deep would be full in 300 ; and the largest lake in less than 3,000 years . Thus , every phase of the creation of a lava dam , the formation of the lake behind it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very short time ( geologically speaking ) . Within a few thousand years after volcanism created a dam , erosion destroyed it . Most of the water-saturated lake sediment that filled the canyon was flushed out rapidly , leaving small patches clinging precariously to the canyon walls in only the most protected area . Thus , the Colorado River would regain its position as the supreme geological force in the region . <p> Our research provides an insight into the interplay of volcanism and canyon evolution , but the implications , in human terms , move far beyond an interesting period of geological history . Every dam experiences the same four-stage life cycle : the construction of a barrier , the formation of a lake upstream , the filling up of the lake with sediment , and the ultimate destruction of the dam , with the return of the river to its previous condition . The basic elements of the cycle are the same for all dams  --  whether natural or human constructs . The Colorado River drainage basin now has sixteen major dams , fifty smaller dams , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across southern California and parts of Arizona and Nevada , so that less than one percent of its virgin flow reaches the sea . All of the dams on the Colorado River are in the third stage of the life cycle of a dam , when the lake behind the dam fills with sediment . <p> No dam can remain a permanent feature of the landscape , for it is part of a dynamic system . Glen Canyon Dam was completed in 1964 , and within five years Lake Powell was full of water . Sediment is currently being deposited there at a rapid rate , even though large and small dams upstream trap their own sediment from the Colorado River . Within 700 to 800 years , Lake Powell will be full of mud . The fate of Glen Canyon Dam and Lake Powell can only be the same as that of all of the massive lava dams that once existed in the Grand Canyon . How to Get There <p> Although not for casual visitors ; Toroweap Canyon can be reached from Highway 389 . Nine miles west of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mt . Trumbull 53 miles . A reliable , high-clearance vehicle is a trust for the rocky sixty-mile dirt road trip . You can also drive to Toroweap on a ninety-mire gravel road from Saint George , Utah .
