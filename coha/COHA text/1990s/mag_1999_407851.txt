We took the altogether lovable - and tremendously fit- Halle Berry to L.A. 's hottest exercise classes . Here are her likes , dislikes and her pick for the leader of the classes . By Michele Kort Photograph // In the way-busy world of Halle Berry - actress ( " Bulworth , " " Boomerang , " " Jungle Fever , " " The Flintstones , " the TV miniseries " Queen " ) , model ( Revlon ) and now executive producer ( of the new HBO movie she also stars in , " Introducing Dorothy Dandridge " ) - exercise is just the ticket for letting off steam . " Sure it 's nice to stay fit - my body 's my instrument and I have to keep it tuned but exercise is a great way to work out aggression , too , " says Berry . Exercise also helps our stunning , hourglass-figured cover model keep weight on . " I 've had more of an issue trying to keep weight on than off , " says Berry , 31 , who 's so darn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's because when I 'm stressed out , I do n't eat . And exercise can de-stress and take the weight of the world off your shoulders . " As an African-American leading lady in Hollywood , Berry has had to shoulder more of the world 's weight than most , which is what drew her to Dandridge , the first African-American nominated for the Best Actress Oscar ( for her 1952 portrayal of " Carmen Jones " ) . Like Dandridge , Berry was born in Cleveland - in the same hospital , in fact - but " the biggest similarity is our professional journey , being in an industry where it seems nobody knows what to do with you . Cameron Diaz has her pick of many different things she can do , but a glamorous black leading lady does n't have very many . This is a battle that I face , just as Dorothy faced it . " Berry 's been pretty public about all the battles she 's faced - from the prejudice shown her as a mixed-race child ( her mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single parent ) , to a physically abusive early relationship , to dealing with diabetes ( which she manages with diet and exercise ) , to her painful divorce from baseball player David Justice . " Since I 've been divorced , I have n't run to another man to heal the scars , " says Berry , who nonetheless looks forward to eventually remarrying and having children . " I just spent time with myself , realizing my strengths and looking my weaknesses dead in the face . I went through this dark hole between 28 and 30 and thought I would never get out , but surprisingly , the sun comes out again . Now I 'm wiser , I 'm stronger , I 'm more in control . " Her honesty has been helpful to others in similar situations , and therapeutic for Berry herself . " Celebrities get put on this pedestal , and people think they have no issues , that their life is just bliss , " she says . " I 've gotten to share with people , Hey , I 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone , it makes me feel that my celebrity means more than just getting cool dresses for the Oscars . We 're all on the same journey , we 're all trying to figure out this thing called life . " Proving what an off-the-pedestal kind of gal she is , Berry gamely agreed to try out three of the hottest exercise classes in Los Angeles and assess them for Shape . Here 's the Berry Fitness Report Card : Photograph // Steve Ross ' Ashtanga Yoga class at Maha Yoga , Brentwood . Yoga is n't new to Berry , since she does it regularly with a teacher at her Los Angeles home . But yoga done to a hiphop or world beat sure is . Ross ' popular hour-and-a-half class is packed with pupils on mats , and backed with a booming soundtrack that surprisingly ranges from Lauryn Hill to Middle Eastern chants . Berry enjoyed the workout - and her graceful poses proved she 's an old hand at the discipline - but she was n't sure about the loud music . " I thought it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or who have stereotypes about what yoga is . They can go to this class and think , This can be fun ! ' But when I 'm doing yoga , I need to be quiet and serene and peaceful . That 's how I get the most out of it , " she says . " More than a body exercise , yoga is a mind exercise for me . It helps me balance my inner scale , connect with myself , center myself With this type of music , I could n't quiet my mind enough . " Debbie Rocker 's Spinning Class at The Ride , Sherman Oaks . Berry was eager to try Spinning , which she had never done , and in this class the loud , hard-rocking music was much appreciated , especially since she found the cardio workout quite challenging and exhausting . " The music helped me , because I could spin with its rhythm and take my mind off the fact that my legs were about to fall off , " she laughs . On the other hand , the darkened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt she could make a mind-body-spirit connection , even though Rocker did offer frequent spirit-oriented cues . " For me , Spinning was about endurance , about winning , about climbing the hill , about your ego kicking in , " says Berry . " Debbie Rocker was trying to connect your mind and body , and I was trying to listen to her , but for me it was just about finishing the race . " Though she liked the gung-ho challenge , Spinning probably is n't an exercise Berry would stick with . " It did me in , " she says . -I 'm just not really good with cardio . I get cramps easily in my legs and sides . I 'm a sprinter type . If it 's a long haul , I poop out . " Mari Winsor 's Pilates Training , Winsor Fitness , West Hollywood . Berry had done Pilates work before , but her previous trainer brought portable equipment to her . At Winsor 's celebfilled studio ( Daisy Fuentes and Sally Kellerman were working out on the same rainy morning Berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reformer " and the " Cadillac " made the workout seem new . And Berry loved it as Winsor first stretched her out , then guided her through a full-body series of bench exercises that use pulleys , springs and your own body weight to work muscles from a variety of angles . The class leader ? Pilates , no question . " It seems easier on your joints , and your muscles than standard weight training , " says Berry . " You sort of ease yourself into toning your body . " Halle 's final workout verdict : She says she plans to continue Pilates classes , which will balance out her regular athome yoga routine and the cardio/free-weight workout she does with her trainer .
