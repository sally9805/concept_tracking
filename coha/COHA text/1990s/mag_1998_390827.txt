Section : SITES FOR ALL EYES THE INTERNET : Family Time <p> IS YOUR FAMILY LOST IN CYBERSPACE ? YOU know the feeling . Maybe it 's the rush of frustration that comes after your son says he needs an image of a skeleton for a science paper but he ca n't find one on the Internet  --  and neither can you . Or perhaps it 's that twinge of anxiety as your preteen daughter announces she wants to chat with classmates online , but you 're not sure how she can do it safely . If you 're unsure how to navigate the Web , you 're not alone . The millions of pages of information on the Net can make locating useful and enjoyable stops seem more work than play . How can you choose among them ? We 've done the work for you by picking six terrific Web destinations . As a group they offer the useful advice parents need with the fun features kids want . <p> To get you started , we looked at all-purpose sites like Yahoo that want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet . They provide search services and additional features that often include news , stocks , games , chat and free e-mail . There 's a fierce battle for your attention raging among the portals and portal wanna-bes , which include AOL.com , AltaVista , Excite , Infoseek , Lycos , MSN.com , Netcenter and Snap . To make matters more confusing , portal sites are always adding new features such as private clubs and city guides that are soon matched by competitors . So what 's a family to do ? <p> In short , head to Excite or Yahoo . Both offer so many benefits that it 's impossible to detail all of them in the short reviews below . Much of what they offer is available at other Web sites , but Excite and Yahoo are especially family friendly . They could soon lose that distinction , however . Netscape 's Netcenter , for example , was planning to add more family content at press time , and Infoseek , with partner Disney , will launch a new service called the Go Network by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead the pack . <p> Neither is a final destination , but only a first stop . When your family is ready to move on , try some of the other destinations below . They all offer games , tips for noncomputer activities , jokes , riddles , help- ful peer support and valuable parenting resources . No Web site is perfect , but these come close to offering sure-bet surfing . TABLE <p> What we liked : Excite has virtually all the features you expect in a Web hub , including a useful search engine , free e-mail , weather , news , games and stock reports . But its biggest appeal for families will be the new community area ( **26;693;TOOLONG ) . It gives you a private online club with shared group calendars , contact lists , a discussion area for posting and responding to messages , a photo area and a live chat room . It 's a terrific tool for any group  --  2,000 different communities existed at the end of the service 's first public month but seems especially helpful to extended families or households @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A son away at college , say , can follow a sibling 's soccer schedule , while a distant aunt can draw closer by chatting with other relatives , sharing photos or swapping recipes . <p> What we did n't like : Excite 's community URL did n't always work . Seeing Perl error trapped ' on screen after sending an invitation to 15 friends to join our personal community was not a confidence builder . It was impossible to edit our contact list , and sometimes duplicate news stories appeared in the NewsTracker clipping service . TABLE <p> What we liked : As the most popular Web directory , Yahoo has no shortage of visitors or features , and its clean , text-only home page is fast and easy to use . As with Excite , a big benefit for families can be found in the My Clubs area ( clubs.yahoo.com ) , which Yahoo launched last spring . When we visited , My Clubs did n't measure up to the communities area of Excite . No group calendar or photo albums were available , although company execs say those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of the area , which includes at least six fan clubs devoted to TV 's Ally McBeal . ' Other draws include Yahooligans ( www . yahooligans.com ) , a simple , terrific kid-safe Web directory , and the Seniors Guide ( seniors.yahoo.com ) , which caters to the over-50 set . My Yahoo ( my.yahoo.com ) lets you personalize the site for your family in lots of ways . Moviegoers can add local theater listings to the mix , for example . <p> What we did n't like : The stand-alone calendar 's reminder feature worked only once out of the four times we tried it . That might have been the result of an interface that fails to make it clear that you must press the options key in order to set your time zone . The vacation finder needs tweaking , too : there were no listings at all for Hawaii , the first time we checked . Later we found plenty of packages but none specifically for families . TABLE <p> What we liked : Children 's Television Workshop , the folks responsible for Sesame Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web with this edutainment ' site for young children . Visitors can tickle Elmo on screen , send e-mail to Big Bird , go high tech ( through family tech tips ) or go low tech ( with black-and-white images for kids to print out and color ) . Parents ' Toolbox has a host of resources on health , parenting , travel , education and many other topics . The Best of the Web area features reviews of kid-safe sites , while Preschool Playground offers games , stories and lots of online and offline activities . <p> What we did n't like : Despite an otherwise exemplary privacy policy , CTW does n't require parental permission before children divulge their e-mail addresses in messages to Sesame Street ' characters . We were not surprised but disappointed to discover that the Delicious Fun area , sponsored by Kellogg 's , included cereal as one of the healthy snacks that should be kept within a child 's reach . We wo n't quibble with that conclusion , but parents need to be vigilant if they are bothered by any blurring between content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plenty to appeal to kids , and parents should also be happy , since Headbone Interactive takes Internet safety issues seriously . The site 's e-mail system , for example , lets you approve the list of e-mail addresses from which your child can receive messages . E-mail not on the approved list gets sent to your e-mail address so you can intercept inappropriate messages . The company says its chat rooms are monitored and use so-called swear filters to keep the chatter clean . The games area has a mix of games , trivia contests and riddles . Illustrated tech-whiz Delores answers questions about science and technology , while Velma , a cartoon pig , responds to tough , honest questions from kids about life and romance ( and invariably tries to discourage them from having sex ) . <p> What we did n't like : It 's not Headbone 's fault , but it was sobering to realize the amount of peer pressure on children to have sex at an early age . That became apparent by reading the questions children posed to Ask Velma . TABLE <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family-involvement newsletter . That history shows in its site , which boasts a no-nonsense combination of news , activities and information that helps parents of children between preschool age to high school and beyond . Articles cover a broad range of topics and ages , including how to tell if your preschooler has learning disabilities and which qualities colleges look for in their applicants . Experts regularly answer questions , while message boards let you swap advice or debate issues with oth- er parents and the site 's licensed family therapist . If your child 's school is a member of the FamilyEducation Network , you may have access to school calendars , school-board minutes and similar information . The ability to get cogent , age-appropriate information about children and their educational needs make this site a must-stop for many parents . <p> What we did n't like : The site map is n't comprehensive , forcing you to click through a lot of links to find everything the site offers . The so-called Resource Center purports to bring all your interests into one convenient place . ' It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we liked : Folks who want or need to connect with others through cyberspace will find a host of reasons to do it via Talk City , which strives to offer civilized discourse on the Internet . You need to download software to chat at this site , but we found it simple and easy to do . The company says its children 's chat areas are monitored . That 's good for kids who like to chat and good for parents who are uncomfortable with the freewheeling discussions that predominate in chat areas sponsored by hubs like Excite and Yahoo . As a result , Talk City is a safe place for families to find support among peers or to discuss topics of interest . The twice-weekly Caregiver 's Coffee Hour ( www . talkcity.com/calendar , then search for caregiver ' for details ) , for example , offers guidance to those caring for ailing loved ones . A college channel ( **42;721;TOOLONG ) and teen-chat area ( **39;765;TOOLONG ) appeal to older youngsters , while visitors can create their own private chat areas if they prefer , linking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This winter a holiday camp will keep kids occupied with virtual activities while school is out . Talk City also sponsors free home pages that are amazingly easy to create . <p> What we did n't like : Finding events we had spotted on earlier visits can be a challenge . There 's no kids ' channel , for example , so you have to do a search or view the events calendar by topic to find KidzKorner . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : EXCITE : Particularly useful for large , extended families <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : YAHOO ! One of the first and still one of the best <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : FAMILY WORKSHOP : From the ' Sesame Street ' folks <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : HEADBONE : Lets you intercept inappropriate messages <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : FAMILYEDUCATION : Offers a broad range of topics and ages <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : TALK CITY : A safe place for kids , and parents , to chat <p> ILLUSTRATIONS <p> By DEBORAH BRANSCUM <p>        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
