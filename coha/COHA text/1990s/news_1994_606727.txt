<p> Did the coincidence of running into my ex-boyfriend in the Chevy Chase Circle Safeway twice in three days after months without a sighting mean he had a spiritually significant message to impart to me , or did it mean , as my friend Larry said , " You were both hungry for dinner " ? <p> It may depend on whether you 've read " The Celestine Prophecy . " The country is subdividing itself on yet another cultural fault line : Those who have read the book Get It . Those who have n't Do n't Get It . <p> If you Get It , you know that the seemingly mysterious coincidences that occur in everyone 's life each have a message and a meaning that , if recognized , advance you along your path toward enlightenment . If you do n't , you think I just as easily could have run into Phil at , say , a Giant or Magruder 's or Food Lion instead of a Safeway , even though when it happened I was nervous because I was about to leave town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Have a good time , " would I have gone to Seattle with such confidence ? <p> " The Celestine Prophecy , " 29 weeks on the bestseller list , is a fictitious adventure quest for a lost manuscript in Peru containing nine spiritual truths  --  - " Insights "  --  which together light the evolutionary path ahead for humankind . Humankind 's hapless individuals will Get the Insights by discerning meaning in their own coincidences . Author James Redfield writes that when a critical mass of enlightened individuals is reached in this way , civilization will evolve toward a closer connection with the Divine as we near the third millennium . <p> The plot itself is a baldly contrived device for putting the Insights out there to a mass audience , to wit : This guy gets on a plane to Peru the day after a friend he has n't seen in years shows up to tell him about the manuscript , not even asking about supersaver fares or a Saturday night stay-over . Does he work ? Did he leave a number ? Who is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't matter . If you Get It , you 're reading for the Insights , which the nameless narrator finds not coincidentally through a series of coincidences . The Insights are why " The Celestine Prophecy " has become a hardcover chain letter with , as Ed McMahon would say , " Friends telling friends telling friends " about it . <p> In fact , all over the country , people are calling their friends  --  the ones who they think might Get It  --  and saying things like , " You 've got to read this book , call me when you get to the Eighth Insight , I do n't care what time it is . " ( Pause . ) " So call me from the plane . " <p> And invariably , friends call more friends from Airfones and the critical mass continues to grow exponentially as people Get It with a swelling chorus of , " OF COURSE ! " <p> Actually , you think " of course ! " 10 times in the course of reading " The Celestine Prophecy " : once for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " OF COURSE ! " for the entire book . The " Celestine " phenomenon is not only that word-of-mouth has propelled an initially privately published new age manifesto into a fiction bestseller for Warner Books  --  in its 22nd printing , there are 1.55 million copies out there so far  --  but that something happens to people who read it . Specifically , two kinds of scary things dawn on you : 1 ) that you really are part of a critical mass making a global consciousness shift from various degrees of cluelessness to enlightenment ; and that your own hill o ' beans life really is far richer , more meaningful and more invested with mission than you ever could imagine while waiting in line at your local motor vehicles department . <p> Once you realize these things , you immediately begin paying strict attention to your coincidences , mindful of Redfield 's premise that there are no happenstances . <p> You really do think you might be destined to meet at some future time the driver of the car in front of you whose license plate says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether Bosnia and Rwanda are examples of a globally endemic restlessness moving nations as well as individuals ultimately toward loving community . You really do feel sure there 's a point to running into your ex at the Safeway . You find yourself going through the same consciousness-rousings as the guy who paid full fare to Peru . <p> Because this is the truly weird thing about " The Celestine Prophecy " : You read it and it does n't merely make sense to you ; all of a sudden the book seems to be about your life and your life seems to be about the book . <p> Now , granted , it is the kind of book I would have read anyway , had no one ever heard of it . But as it was , a friend  --  not Larry  --  told me about it right before I left to visit my new beau in Seattle for the first time . I thought this meant something , so I bought the book to read on the trip . I did n't ask Larry what he thought it meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It means you spent $ 17.95 and have to schlep a hardcover around for a week . " <p> Parenthetically , this kind of Does n't Get It thinking is exactly why people who read " The Celestine Prophecy " enthuse over the book only with certain other people . This is why notices for the hundreds of " Celestine " discussion groups clustering around the country tend to be posted on bulletin boards at bookstores and not at work . You just ca n't explain this stuff to people who Do n't Get It . " The Celestine Prophecy " contains ideas that most people do n't take out to show company . <p> But if you read the book , you wo n't be a bit surprised at what happened to me when I did . <p> The day after the second Safeway encounter , I left for Seattle , the book in tow . I was quietly savoring the Fourth Insight somewhere over Kansas when the flight attendant rested her gaze on the book as she handed me a plastic glass  --  a mysterious occurrence in itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that about ? I see everyone reading it . " She looked like she might Get It , so I told her . She said , " That sounds like something I should read . If you finish it before we land , can I have your copy ? " I was n't finished when we landed , so she went to buy her own , telling me she was obviously supposed to or why else would she have kept noticing the book until our paths crossed ? <p> The first day in Seattle , my new beau told me about this amazing book he 'd just been given for his birthday : " The Celestine Prophecy . " We both realized why he 'd Gotten It and our relationship promptly accelerated . The next day , nine hours after I 'd carefully studied the photos of his most recent ex , I recognized her having coffee alone at a downtown Starbucks . That flipped me out so much , I put the book down for the rest of the week . <p> When I figured it was safe again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the book out nine minutes when a mauve-colored business card suddenly landed on the page I was reading . Under his printed name , phone number and business  --  " Past Life Regressions "  --  my correspondent had written in ballpoint , " Seattle Celestine Prophecy Group . " I looked up to see a blond fellow with a radiant energy field smiling at me in the aisle . No words needed , we laughed pleasedly while most of the passengers around us Did n't Get It , although I did see one or two knowing smiles . I finally told him I 'd make sure my new beau got the message because I was the one from the other Northwest Washington  --  a natural case of mistaken spiritual identity . He said , " Then that 's who my card was obviously intended for in the first place . " We laughed some more , and he warmly said , " See you later , " knowing we would and that " later " might mean in nine lifetimes . <p> I was n't going to tell Larry any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . <p> This really happened : <p> The week I got home , Larry and I met for coffee . He 'd had a strange day . That morning while he was waiting to use a pay phone near the National Archives , the guy on the phone looked at him and said , " Are you waiting for the phone ? " There was something about the guy 's tone that instantly turned my normally courteous if not courtly friend into a raging bull . So instead of , " Yes , thank you , " what came out of his mouth was , " No , doofus , I 'm hanging around to watch you . " <p> Control drama , I thought , Insight No. 4 . <p> Then , stopping to get a newspaper in Dupont Circle , he noticed that someone had left a sheaf of papers on top of the vending machine . There was no name on it , but it appeared to be several typewritten chapters of a book on Reconstruction , with handwritten notes in the margin . <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Celestine Prophecy . " To my amazement , he Got It immediately . <p> " Are you saying I 'm supposed to read this book because I found a lost manuscript ? " he asked me . <p> " It is about spiritual reconstruction , " I told him . <p> ( NOTE : If by some " coincidence " the owner of the manuscript he found is reading this , call me and we 'll get it back to you . ) <p> So Larry read " The Celestine Prophecy . " <p> " What does it mean , " I asked him a few weeks later , " that this man from Seattle came to visit the same week the Mariners played the O 's at Camden Yards ? " <p> I waited for him to say something like , " It means he figured there was going to be a strike and wanted to get his Ken Griffey Jr . sightings in while he could . " <p> He did n't . He 's thinking about it .
