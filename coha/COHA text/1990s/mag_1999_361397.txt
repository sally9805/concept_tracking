I know Kurt Andersen . Everyone knows Kurt Andersen ( especially here at TIME , where he was on staff for six years ) . I just know him less well than everybody else does , so it falls to me to review Turn of the Century ( Random House ; 659 pages ; $24.95 ) , his novel about the world in which " everyone " can be defined as the people Kurt Andersen knows . <P> This , if you 're wondering , is a compliment . Since his time at TIME , Andersen has been a founding editor of Spy , the editor in chief of New York , a producer of network specials , a staff writer for the New Yorker . He knows the three points of the buzz compass  --  Manhattan , Hollywood and the Microsoft campus in Redmond , Wash .  --  as well as anyone . Or at least as well as anyone who has so keen an appreciation for the pomposities , vapidities and idiocies that constitute the murmur of our times . As his chief characters  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's software-entrepreneur wife , the wife 's vulpine media-mogul boss  --  alternately cavort and limp through the very near future , you get deep inside the tent of both old and new media , where the egos are as large and as tasteless as the limos . <P> This is one big mama of a book , its very size a hint of its ambition . Put the same characters and story into 250 pages , which Andersen could easily have done , and you 'd have an amusing satire ; at 659 pages , you 're trying to create something Important . There are two problems with this strategy : first , to get it all in , Andersen is forced to spin scenes in which one character sort of asks another , " Tell me about how that works "  --  whereupon Andersen hijacks the character 's voice for an invariably brilliant riff on news anchors or online stock trading or the politics of software . <P> Worse , you just do n't end up with a novel . While he capitalizes handsomely on the freedom afforded by fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of libel ! ) , Andersen is hamstrung by the overall structure that the genre demands . His sentences may sparkle , but the book 's forward motion is a sputtering lope . Its loose , digressive shape makes Turn of the Century awfully easy to put down . <P> But as nearly every page on its own is alive with wit and observation and sparks of inspired nastiness , it 's thrilling to pick it back up , for exquisite set pieces on the man who introduced " female butt cleavage " to network TV , on the four meanings ( three of them ironic ) of the term " your friend , " on corporate travel ( flying business class is " a protection racket  --  you pay extra , or you just might get roughed up in coach " ) . <P> So fecund is Andersen 's satiric gift , and so broad his scope , that he almost incidentally sprays tiny rat-a-tat bullets at Alec Baldwin , Rupert Murdoch , Stephen Jay Gould , AIDS-awareness ribbons and the word lite . With a sweeter brand of malice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street **32;8268;TOOLONG ( and TIME columnist ) James J. Cramer , who is clearly the model for one of his more memorable characters .
