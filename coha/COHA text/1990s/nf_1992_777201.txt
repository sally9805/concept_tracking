Introduction // The Universal Male // Man is the measure of all things . // Protagoras ( c. 485-410 B.C. ) // Join me , if you will , in a brief flight of fancy . George Jones , age thirty-four , visits the " psychology and health " section of his local bookstore . There he finds an assortment of books designed to solve his problems with love , sex , work , stress , and children : // * Women Who Hate Men and the Men . Who Love Them explains why he remains in a self-defeating relationship with Jane . // * The X Spot and other new findings about male sexuality tells him exactly how to have the right kind of multiple orgasm that women have . // * The Male Manager shows why his typically male habits of competitiveness and individualism prevent him from advancing in the female-dominated , cooperative corporate world . // * Cooperation Training offers practical instructions for overcoming his early competitive socialization as a man , showing him how to get along more smoothly with others . // * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardy than women throughout their lives , men find it difficult to combine work and family . They would live as long as women do if they would scale down their efforts to seek power and success . // * The Father Knot and The Reproduction of Fathering explore the reasons that George feels so guilty about the way he is raising his children . Women feel comfortable with motherhood , these books argue , because they bear and nurse their offspring . But men for basic anatomical reasons are doomed to feel insecure and guilty in their role as fathers because unconsciously they never quite believe the child is theirs . // * Erratic Testosterone Syndrome ( ETS )  --  What it is and how to live with it provides medical and psychological information to help George cope with his hormonal ups and downs . Because men do not have a visible monthly reminder of hormonal changes , they fail to realize that their moodiness and aggressive outbursts are hormonally based . A special concluding chapter helps the wives of men with ETS learn to live with their husbands ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never feel obliged to read books like these , were anyone ever to write them ; but of course women feel obliged to read the comparable volumes directed to them . It 's a puzzle that they do , actually , because most of these books imply that women are n't doing anything right . Women are irrational and moody because of their hormones . They cry too much . They love too much . They talk too much . They think differently . They are too dependent on unworthy men , but if they leave the men to fend for themselves , they are too independent , and if they stay with the men they are codependent . They are too emotional , except when the emotion in question is anger , in which case they are n't emotional enough . They do n't have correct orgasms , the correct way , with the correct frequency . They pay too much attention to their children , or not enough , or the wrong kind . They are forever subject to syndromes : the Superwoman Syndrome causes the Stress Syndrome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a Menopausal Deficiency Syndrome . // Why do women buy so many self-help books every year to improve their sex lives , moods , relationships , and mental health ? Simone de Beauvoir gave us one answer in 1949 : because women are the second sex , the other sex , the sex to be explained . Men and women are not simply considered different from one another , as we speak of people differing in eye color , movie tastes , or preferences for ice cream . In almost every domain of life , men are considered the normal human being , and women are " ab-normal , " deficient because they are different from men . Therefore , women constantly worry about measuring up , doing the right thing , being the right way . It is normal for women to worry about being abnormal , because male behavior , male heroes , male psychology , and even male physiology continue to be the standard of normalcy against which women are measured and found wanting . // Despite women 's gains in many fields in the last twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the corresponding abnormality of women , has remained virtually untouched . Now even this entrenched way of thinking is being scrutinized and the reverberations are echoing across the land . Everywhere we look , it seems , teachers , courses , theories , and books are being challenged to examine their implicit assumption that man is the measure of all things . // Thus , in politics , we have " important issues " ( drugs , economics , war ) and then " women 's issues " ( day care , birth control , peace ) , as if these matters could or should be divided at the gender line . Congress and the United Nations worry about international violations of " human rights , " but these rarely include violations of women 's rights such as denial of suffrage , wife-beating , genital mutilation , forced prostitution , or sweatshops that run on underpaid female labor . Somehow , these are " women 's issues , " not " human rights " issues . We worry , as well we should , about the feminization of poverty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masculinization of wealth . The phrase " unfit mother " rolls trippingly off judicial tongues , but " unfit father " is nowhere to be heard . We ponder the problem of unwed , " sexually irresponsible " teenage mothers , not the problem of unwed , sexually irresponsible teenage fathers . Boys will be boys , we say , but girls better not be mothers . Indeed , reproductive freedom in general is a " woman 's issue , " as if men were merely disinterested bystanders on the matter of sexuality and its consequences . // The perception of female otherness occurs in every field , as we are learning from critical observers in science , law , medicine , history , economics , social science , literature , and art . In medicine , students learn anatomy and physiology and , separately , female anatomy and physiology ; the male body is anatomy-itself . In art , we have works of general excellence and , separately , works by women artists , generally regarded as different and lesser ; male painters represent art-itself . In literature , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century " is considered a specialized seminar ; yet when an English instructor at Georgetown University called her course " white male writers , " it was news  --  because the works of white male writers are regarded as literature-itself . In psychoanalysis , Freud took the male as the developmental norm for humanity , regarding female development as a pale and puny deviation from it . // In history , the implicit use of men as the norm pervades much of what schoolchildren learn about American and Western civilization . Was Greece the cradle of democracy ? It was no democracy for women and slaves . Was the Renaissance a time of intellectual and artistic rebirth ? There was no renaissance for women  --  " at least , " wrote historian Joan Kelly , " not during the Renaissance . " Did the Enlightenment expand " the rights of man " in education , politics , and work ? Yes , but it narrowed the rights of women , who were denied control of their property and earnings and barred from higher education and professional training . Was the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " taming " the wilderness and founding a culture based on self-reliance ? This mythic vision excludes the women who struggled to establish homes , survive childbirth , care for families , and contribute with men to the community that was essential to survival . // In economics , supposedly the study of pure market forces and the " Rational Man " ( in comparison to the irrational  --  whom ? ) , the field relies on measures of gross national product as the main gauge of a nation 's economic performance , overlooking the value of women 's unpaid labor in the home and the invisible work they do that lies outside market economies . For example , as political economist Marilyn Waring has shown , the work of women farmers in underdeveloped nations is not computed in economic formulas that are the basis for agricultural assistance programs . The result is that women farmers lose government aid , with devastating results for food production and the nutritional health of their families . " Economics-itself " does not concern itself with such matters . Students of economics are left with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underpayment of women 's labor in the work force do not matter , or that they are aberrations in an otherwise rational system , or that women are to blame for allowing themselves to become trapped in low-paying or nonpaying jobs . // In philosophy , the centrality in thought and language of the universal male affects the ability to reason about humanity . The philosopher Elizabeth Minnich reminds us of the famous syllogism : // All men are mortal . // Socrates is a man . // Therefore , Socrates is mortal . // But , Minnich suggests , try this one : // All men are mortal . // Alice is  --  // Alice is  --  what ? We ca n't say " Alice is a man . " So we say she is a woman . Therefore  --  what ? Alice is immortal ? Alice , being female , is in a category that is neither masculine nor mortal : // Alice ends up in the peculiar position of being a somewhat mortal , somewhat immortal , creature . Or , we must admit , we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female at all . We can think of Socrates as a man without derailing the syllogism ; we can not think of Alice as a woman . Reason flounders ; the center holds , with Man in it , but it is an exclusive , not a universal or neutral , center . Alice disappears through the looking glass . // Many people , Minnich adds , find it odd , uncomfortable , or threatening to suggest that it is appropriate to expand a field 's horizons to include all humankind . " What does it mean for democracy , " she asks , " that only some few kinds of humans can be imagined as our representatives ? What does it mean for all of us on this shrinking globe ? " // My inquiry in this book is motivated by the spirit of Minnich 's question : I wish to examine the consequences for us all , male and female , when only some few of us set the standards of normalcy and universality . My goal is to expand our visions of normalcy , not to replace a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we must first unmask the three most popular disguises of the universal male . Each of these currently popular ways of thinking about men and women has its adherents and detractors , and each leads to different consequences for how we live our lives : // * Men are normal ; women , being " opposite , " are deficient . This us-them , yin-yang , masculine-is-good , feminine-is-bad view of the sexes is the oldest tradition in civilization . It regards men and women as polar opposites , with males as the repository of culture , intellectuality , and strength , and females the repository of nature , intuition , and weakness . // * Men are normal ; women are opposite from men , but superior to them . Proponents of this view emphasize aspects of female experience or female " nature "  --  such as menstruation , childbirth , compassion , spirituality , cooperation , pacifism , and harmony with the environment  --  and celebrate them as being morally superior to men 's experiences and qualities . In this view , nevertheless , man is still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the judgments are kinder . // * Men are normal , and women are or should be like them . Proponents of this approach , which would seem to be the antidote to the fundamental-difference schools , actually commit an intrinsic error of their own . By ignoring the differences that do exist between men and women  --  in life experiences , resources , power , and reproductive processes  --  the basically-alike school assumes that it is safe to generalize from the male standard to all women . // These three errors , in their various incarnations , have done serious harm to women 's feelings about themselves , to their relationships , and to their position in society . They are responsible for the guilt-inducing analyses that leave women feeling that once again they lack the right stuff and are n't doing the right thing . They have made sicknesses and syndromes of women 's normal bodily processes , and " diseases " of women 's normal experiences . They have framed the debate over solutions to social problems , and led reformers down unproductive paths . They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and connection , perpetuating unhappiness and outright warfare in the family , where many men and women remain baffled by the mysterious opposite sex . // The confusion over whether women are the " same " as men , and whether they can be " different but equal , " is at the heart of the current debates between ( and about ) the sexes . In contrast , I take as my basic premise that there is nothing essential  --  that is , universal and unvarying  --  in the natures of women and men . Personality traits , abilities , values , motivations , roles , dreams , and desires : all vary across culture and history , and depend on time and place , context and situation . Of course , if you photograph the behavior of women and men at a particular time in history , in a particular situation , you will capture differences . But the error lies in inferring that a snapshot is a lasting picture . What women and men do at a moment in time tells us nothing about what women and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be . // * The mismeasure of woman // Not long ago the firm of Price Waterhouse was charged with discrimination in not granting partnership status to a woman named Ann Hopkins . Everyone agreed that Hopkins did her job well . She brought in over $40 million in new business to the firm , far more than any of the eighty-seven other nominees , all of whom were male , and forty-seven of whom were invited to become partners . Most of the opposition to Hopkins came from brief comments from the partners who had had limited contact with her and were unaware of her track record . They described her as " macho , " harsh , and aggressive , and one speculated that she " may have overcompensated for being a woman . " One man , trying to be helpful , advised her to " walk more femininely , talk more femininely , dress more femininely , wear make-up , have her hair styled , and wear jewelry . " // Hopkins 's supporters described her behavior as outspoken , independent , self-confident , assertive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overbearing , arrogant , self-centered , and abrasive . " Why is it , " asked Lynn Hecht Schafran , an attorney on Hopkins 's case , " that men can be bastards and women must wear pearls and smile ? " // At the same time that the Hopkins case was wending its way to the Supreme Court ( where she eventually won ) , an attorney named Brenda Taylor lost her job because she was too feminine : she favored short skirts , designer blouses , ornate jewelry , and spike heels . Her boss told her that she looked like a " bimbo , " and she was fired after she complained about his remarks to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission . // Ann Hopkins and Brenda Taylor illustrate the pressures on modern women to be feminine and masculine , to be different from men but also the same . How is a woman supposed to behave : like an ideal male , in which case her male colleagues will accuse her of not being feminine enough , or like an ideal female , in which case her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? // We will never know the truth about Ann Hopkins  --  whether she is outspoken or overbearing , confident or arrogant  --  because both sets of perceptions are true , from the beholder 's standpoint . But by framing the problem as one of her personality , her colleagues deflected attention from the systematic practices of their company and from their own behavior . Suppose , instead , we ask : Under what conditions is the negative stereotype of women like Hopkins more likely to occur ? The answer , according to research summarized in a brief prepared by the American Psychological Association on behalf of Hopkins , is that men are likely to behave like the Price Waterhouse partners under three conditions : when the woman ( or other minority ) is a token member of the organization ; when the criteria used to evaluate the woman are ambiguous ; and when observers lack necessary information to evaluate the woman 's work . All three conditions were met in Hopkins 's situation . She could have read 435 books on how to behave , and they would have failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a muu-muu or Saran Wrap , and she still would have lost that promotion . In this case , her personality had nothing to do with it . // Ann Hopkins 's dilemma  --  whether a woman is supposed to behave like a man or a woman  --  is played out a thousand times a day , in the varied domains of women 's lives . A woman who leaves her child in day care worries that she is failing as a mother ; but if she leaves her job temporarily to stay home with her child , she worries that she will fail in her career . A woman who cries at work worries whether crying is good , since she is a woman , or wrong , since she is a professional . A woman who spends endless hours taking care of her husband and ailing parents feels that she is doing the right thing as a woman , but the wrong thing as an independent person . A woman who can not penetrate her husband 's emotional coolness alternates between trying to turn him into one of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him . // Of the countless self-help books on the market that address these dilemmas , most direct the reader 's attention to women 's alleged inner flaws and psychological deficiencies . Women 's unhappiness , in many of these accounts , is a result of their fear of independence , fear of codependence , fear of success , fear of failure , or fear of fear . Women are told to be more masculine in some ways and more feminine in others . Each of these explanations has a brief moment in the sun . And each eventually fades from sight , to be replaced by similar explanations that flourish briefly and die , because they do not touch the basic reasons for women 's dilemmas : Inequities and ambiguities about " woman 's place " are built into the structure of our lives and society . These dilemmas are normal for women . They will persist as long as women look exclusively inward to their psyches and biology instead of outward to their circumstances , and as long as women blame themselves for not measuring up . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's movement , that issues of difference and equality have been talked into the ground , that equality has been won . Unquestionably , women have made great progress . But our society continues to fight a war over the proper place of women , and the battleground is the female body . Once again we are in the midst of a pronatalist revival that praises motherhood as women 's basic need and talent , and that persists in trying to limit and control women 's reproductive choices . Once again we are hearing arguments about women 's nature , their unreliable physiology , their unmasculine hormones and brains . And once again we are hearing about the problems that face women who wish to combine careers and families , as experts warn of the dangers of day care , the stresses of being superwomen , the empty satisfactions of being corporate executives . // Researchers in the fields of science , medicine , and psychology all celebrate a renewed emphasis on biological explanations of women 's behavior and a medical approach to women 's problems and their cures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , biochemical reasons that more women than men suffer from depression , and hormonal changes that supposedly account for women 's ( but not men 's ) moods and abilities . Their assertions are more likely to make the news than is the evidence that contradicts them . Similarly , women hear much less these days about the psychological benefits of having many roles and sources of esteem , let alone the benefits of having a personal income . // In The Mismeasure of Man , the scientist Stephen Jay Gould showed how science has been used and abused in the study of intelligence to serve a larger social and political agenda : to confirm the prejudice that some groups are assigned to their subordinate roles " by the harsh dictates of nature . " The mismeasure of woman persists because it , too , reflects and serves society 's prejudices . Views of woman 's " natural " differences from man justify a status quo that divides work , psychological qualities , and family responsibilities into " his " and " hers . " Those who are dominant have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differences to " the harsh dictates of nature , " and obscuring the unequal arrangements that benefit them . // Throughout this book , I will be examining the stories behind the headlines and popular theories of sex differences , traveling the trail of the universal male , showing how the belief in male normalcy and female deficiency guides scientific inquiry , shapes its results , and determines which findings make the news and which findings we live by . The following chapters will offer some new ways of looking at the old dilemmas that women and men confront daily . My goal is not to analyze , let alone solve , all the problems that women and men face in their complex lives . But by bringing hidden assumptions into the light , I hope to show how our ways of thinking about women and men lead to certain predictable results for all of us : in law and medicine , in social reforms , in standards of mental health , in the intimacies of sex and love , and in our private reveries of what is possible . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
