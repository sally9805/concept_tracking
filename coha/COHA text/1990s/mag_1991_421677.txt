Section : WALL STREET What the pros say <p> Bold investors seeking the financial equivalent of bungeejumping  --  that New Zealand-born sport in which daredevils tie rubber cords to their ankles and leap from high bridges  --  might consider cyclical stocks . As their name suggests , the prices of these shares dive steeply in a recession 's early stages and then , as the economy begins to recover , bounce back sharply  --  and profitably . <p> Cyclicals include manufacturers of such basic products as chemicals , paper and steel . And right now , many investing professionals think several cyclical companies are poised for a huge rebound , perhaps as big as the one in 1982-83 , when the stocks swooped up by 100% in 17 months , beating Standard &; Poor 's 500-stock index by 46 percentage points . <p> The prices of cyclical shares bounce like yo-yos because the companies have high fixed costs ; if they have to scale back production when customers slash orders , overhead eats up their profits . As a result , cyclical shares finished 1990 down 16.2% , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 500 , according to the Leuthold Group , a Minneapolis investment adviser . <p> With forecasters betting that the economy will start improving by late this year , analysts expect cyclicals to soar . " These stocks are driven by rapid earnings gains and do especially well in the first nine to 12 months of a recovery , " says Peter Canelo , chief investment strategist at County NatWest , a brokerage in New York City . In fact , though cyclicals have n't yet outpaced the 13.7% return on the S &P; 500 , they have already begun their rebound , up 8% so far this year . <p> Even so , several analysts say five big cyclical stocks with large capital-gains potential have been overlooked . All five are winding down multimillion-dollar restructuring and plant-modernization projects , which are expected to depress earnings for another two quarters . But then , in 1992 , the analysts forecast that the companies will leap ahead of their competitors and their share prices will rise by as much as 44% . For the stocks ' price/earnings ratios , dividend yields and target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what analysts have to say about the companies , which are ranked by yield : <p> General Meters ( 1990 revenues : $122 billion ) has suffered in the past year along with its domestic competitors . For the first quarter of 1990 , GM 's losses were a whopping $1.1 billion . <p> What investors have missed , says Prudential Securities analyst Philip Fricke , is that GM has sharply cut costs . It now has 33 assembly plants in North America , down from 41 in 1987  --  and its cars are the highest quality in its history . For the past three years , GM has held on to its 34% U.S. market share ( down from 44% in 1984 ) , and Fricke expects an industrywide 10% increase in North American auto sales next year . <p> Overseas , GM has seen its European sales grow to $24 billion in 1990 , up 123% from five years ago . While business in Germany , which provides nearly half of GM 's $2.4 billion foreign profits , is expected to slow , Fricke regards this as temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.K. <p> Overall , he forecasts earnings of $3.80 a share for 1992 , compared with a projected $0.65 loss this year . And although the company cut its annual dividend this year from $3 to $1.60 , analysts say GM is likely to raise it by late 1994 , possibly to $3 . <p> U.S. Steel ( 1990 revenues : $5.5 billion ) has spent five years and $2.2 billion to close outdated facilities and convert 50% of its capacity from the labor-intensive in-got method of production to lower-cost continuous casting . Today , analysts say , the company is the most efficient integrated steel producer in the U.S. <p> In 1982 , USX , U.S. Steel 's parent , acquired Marathon Oil in an attempt to shield itself from the steel cycle 's boom and bust . That strategy failed , however , and stockholders voted in May to split USX shares into two classes  --  representing oil and steel operations  --  in hopes of boosting the price . <p> Analysts think shares in the company 's oil business are already fully valued , but they are enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarence Morrison of Prudential Securities : " As the industry rebounds near the end of this year , U.S. Steel will benefit disproportionately . " <p> Du Pont 's depressed chemical sales have scared investors so badly that , analysts say , they have lost sight of its strong Conoco oil and natural gas subsidiary , which accounts for nearly 40% of the parent company 's $40 billion in sales . Benefiting from higher oil prices , petroleum operations posted record profits last year of more than $1 billion , double the $538 million earned in 1989 . " The oil and gas refining businesses are doing terrific , " says Bear Stearns analyst Jeff Cianci . <p> Du Pont 's chemical and fiber earnings were down 34% last year , hurt by lower demand for carpeting used by the housing and auto industry , for paint pigments and for ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbon gases for refrigerators and air conditioners . While fibers and pigments should turn around with the economy , the company 's refrigerants face a continuing slump . " But Du Pont is spending millions to develop ozone-friendly substitutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 12 to 18 months . " He expects Du Pont 's earnings to jump from $3 a share this year to between $3.25 and $3.50 next year . <p> Willamette , a $2 billion paper and forest-products company , is likely to benefit from a decrease in the U.S. wood supply owing to a proposed governmental lockup of federal and private timberlands . " Forest-products stocks are at their most attractive point since 1985 , " says analyst George Adler of Smith Barney . <p> The company also stands to profit from increased demand for its business forms , linerboard and corrugated boxes . Since ' 88 , in addition to weak paper prices , Willamette has had to contend with $375 million in start-up costs for a new paper mill in Bennettsville , S.C . Adler believes the mill will turn profitable later this year . As paper prices recover , he thinks Willamette 's 1992 earnings will almost double to $4 a share from $2.10 this year . <p> Alcoa ( 1990 revenues : $10.7 billion ) , the world 's largest aluminum producer , got a valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By luck or by design , Alcoa began to modernize its smelters ahead of its peers , " says Kemper Securities analyst Vahid Fathi . " So its $8 billion capital expenditure program is already winding down . " <p> In early 1991 , Alcoa suffered along with other metal manufacturers as aluminum 's price fell to $0.63 a pound , a 25-year low on an inflation-adjusted basis and 15% below the $0.74 average of 1990 . Though the price was below Alcoa 's $0.64-a-pound production cost , the company 's competitors were in even worse shape , since their average cost was $0.68 . Moreover , as aluminum prices recover to a projected $0.75 to $0.85 a pound in 1992 , Fathi expects Alcoa 's earnings to jump 30% to $8.50 .
