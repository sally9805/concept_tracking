It was the kind of research project most social scientists avoid . The researcher had to lay out $50,000 of his own money . He spent six years in one + of Detroit 's most dangerous neighborhoods in the company of two of the most violent street gangs in America . He routinely asked highly personal questions of edgy young men who earn small fortunes selling drugs and have few qualms about killing people who inquire too closely about their activities . <P> For obvious reasons , most research on violent urban subcultures is done with computer printouts , not with tape recorders and notebooks on the mean streets . Not so with Carl S. Taylor , adjunct professor of criminal justice at Michigan State University and director of the Criminal Justice Program at Jackson Community College . In 1980 Taylor set out to study Detroit 's two biggest and most powerful youth gangs : Young Boys Inc. and the Pony Down . In the process , he encountered four additional groups . The resulting book , Dangerous Society , published in February by Michigan State University Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves from opportunistic street punks into sophisticated drug-dealing empires that rake in hundreds of millions a year . <P> Taylor 's work is of far more than academic significance . His major discovery is that even as Young Boys Inc. and the Pony Down were unraveling in the mid- 1980s following the jailings of their leaders , they were being quickly and silently replaced by far more sophisticated and highly secretive business operations . Taylor 's findings contradict the sanguine attitude of fifth-term Mayor Coleman Young and his political allies , who insist that the Motor City no longer has a serious gang problem . Says inspector Benny Napoleon , who monitors gang activity for the Detroit police : " We have nothing remotely resembling a large , well-organized gang . " <P> Taylor presents convincing evidence to the contrary : the groups have become less obvious to the police simply because they have shifted into more covert and more profitable enterprises . " Detroit kids just laugh when they hear people in L.A. are still wearing colors , " says Taylor . " What 's sweeping this city are what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wear gold chains or beepers or Fila sweatsuits anymore . They 're probably wearing ragged clothes and driving ratty cars . They 've seceded from the union . " <P> Cocaine sales fueled the evolution of Detroit 's gangs . They began as what Taylor calls " scavengers , " youths preying on the most vulnerable residents of their neighborhoods . But when the double whammy of crack and job cutbacks in the auto plants smashed into Detroit 's poorest areas during the 1980s , the gangs developed " corporate " organizations with a concern for the bottom line and enough discipline to use violence mainly to protect their drug-dealing turfs . <P> Though smaller and far less visible than the original Young Boys Inc. , which pioneered the use of hard-to-prosecute juveniles to sell drugs , the new-style crews have mimicked its security-conscious structure . " In Y.B.I. , one of the keys was that the left hand did n't know what the right hand was doing , " Taylor says . " That 's still true . At the top of each organization you have what amounts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
