Her phone was one of those black , old-time , heavy jobs with a Bakelite dial , the base made out of ceramic or something  --  granite maybe , or lead . In her condition she could barely lift it . It was getting all but impossible to dial . She looked at it and wondered when he would call . The left hand was bad . No fast-draw Billy-the-Kid hand ; it had no strength whatever . When it worked , it was a cold blue claw and she could hook things with it . Captain Hook . People saw her Mickey Mouse around with the old phone and there was no sympathy . <p> The right hand was a little stronger , her bread-and-butter hand . But as the years passed it also got weaker . She liked to keep everything about her the same . This house , this home , her all-her-life home , forty-seven years in a shotgun shack . The once cheerful and still not such a bad bungalow was home . The doors and windows were now secured with metal bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but hey , that 's L.A. for ya . Two bedrooms , a full basement , the add-on front porch built when her father was still alive . Busy beaver with a paintbrush and flower gardens was he . He had a mania for tidiness , and her mother , too , which made the latter hell on wheels when the diagnosis came through ; when they learned that she would be crippled for life . Turned her mother into a pisser . <p> First memories . Let me see . She could remember walking when she was maybe four . Just a little , you know , it was all so vague , looking back through the haze of the bitter past . Ugly prosthetic shoes . Then the wheelchair . Oh , God , your bony ass could get sore in one of those , day after day , even under a pile of lambskin . So how could a mother not love her only kid ! Well , who said she did n't  --  it was just that when you have to wait on somebody hand and foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harry , rose to the occasion and her mother , Barbara , too , after he passed on fourteen years ago . Barbara finally accepted the situation and made the best of it . On top of everything else there was all the stress and strain of an adult daughter living with a mother , but what are you going to do ? Then Barbara ups and dies . Her face looked like a fried prune in the coffin  --  a final accusation : " See what you did to me ! " <p> Quite unlike her temporal home  --  her own scrawny , dilapidated body  --  the house was still in good condition . Take a normal human body . You could abuse it with drugs , alcohol , tobacco , and junk food and still it would last longer than practically anything . It would last longer than a GE toaster , a pair of Levi 's , or a plain gold wedding ring ( by the fiftieth anniversary , if you finger it enough , if you 're the nervous type , you 'll wear it clean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an African elephant , a Panama parrot , a Rolls-Royce  --  just about everything you laid eyes on except a house . But not the puny body that was hers . The house was still going strong . Sell it and she 'd have two years in a nursing home . It had been a waste of money to keep the yard so perfect . Putting on the vinyl siding  --  whew , she got jobbed on that one , but the salesman was so nice-man , that motherfucker poured out the charm . Oh well . It did look good . The roof needed work . Maybe next year . If there is a next year , huh ?  --  or even a tomorrow . If she could implement the plan there would n't be , but she was chickenshit in regards to the plan . <p> There was the illusion of safety in keeping everything approximately the same . Better the old phone than something new . A brand-new , glossy , plastic , featherweight phone would be a kind of formal acknowledgment . Dead was n't so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real live sumbitch and then pfffttt ! So much for this incarnation . Hey , God , what was I supposed to figure out forty-seven years in this wheelchair ! Forty years plus of staring at the ceiling in silence , looking out the window , listening to classical FM radio , staring at the floor , looking at her face in the bureau mirror  --  a pretty face once , now not so hot . Stare at the ceiling , stare at the floor . Drink gin and watch TV . She never got out much but she knew life all too well , this life , this shadow cave . Nobody but nobody was happy . They might think so , but they were wrong . When you got right down to it , they would rue the day they were born . Do n't believe it ? Wait and see . Ai n't nobody escaped dying . Yeah , everybody wants to go to heaven , but ai n't nobody wants to die . <p> Bobby was back in town . A blast from the past . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , a little trifle he picked up . He barely hits the streets and he 's stealing again . Came over that afternoon , hardly said hi , and he 's on the phone trying to buy her a new refrigerator ' cause the one she 's got is " too loud . " Whoever heard of such a thing ! Too loud . That was pure Bobby . " But I spent a lot of money on that refrigerator It 's not even a year old . " <p> " Yeah , " he says , " and it just goes to show ya , they 've been making refrigerators for years and listen to it . How can you even think ? It 's loud in jail , let me tell you , but that refrigerator is a killer . That sorry motherfucker is putting out Richter waves . You got ta go foreign-made . Japanese . " <p> " What , a Panasonic refrigerator ? " <p> " Hey , I do n't know what you call them . All I know is they do n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's audacious and it 's a damn kitchen appliance . Where does it get off ? Huh ? " <p> So Bobby hops on the phone and starts making calls . On hold , he cranes his neck around the corner and says , " America ca n't make a refrigerator anymore . What is it but a damn box , a compressor , and some shelves and trays ? People are graduating from Harvard with engineering degrees  --  you think they could make a better refrigerator ! Somebody ought to look into it . That thing you got is loud . It 's a fucking Yugo . The German ones are much better  --  like precision , handcrafted engineering and all that jive . The Italian ones look the best , but for a combination of quiet and style , my personal preference is Japanese . A Jap will take one home and say to . the old lady , ' How you liking this fridge , baby ? ' And he 'll say to the little kids , ' How you liking this fridge , honorable son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Not bad , Pop , but the ice tastes like dishwater . ' Honorable daughter will say , ' Daddy , my Popsicles are gooey . ' And that Jap has got his pencil and paper out . That Jap will hop in his Lexus su-preme dream and drive back to the factory at eleven o'clock at night ; roll up his sleeves , and go to town . Make it better ! Make it quiet . Those Nippers can hustle . Around the clock . I mean , I ai n't making no put-downs , no sweeping generalizations  --  I ai n't no racist  --  but there it is . I mean we could wait for the Chinks to start making them , then they really will be cheap  --  Hong Dong or whatever  --  but why jack around ! I got a plane to catch in the morning . " <p> Suddenly he 's talking turkey with a sales representative . Oh yeah  --  the automatic defrosters cause all the racket . They 've got side-by-side doors or over-and-under . Egg storage in the door . Colors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delivery truck shows up , and Bobby and the delivery guys ( Asians ) are transferring all of her food from the old refrigerator to the new one . There is n't much  --  lettuce , baloney , milk , the usual . Bobby says , " They underpower the motors . On a hot day it 's huffing constantly , I bet . Sounds like a D-6 Cat with a messed-over muffler . Ever since I walked in the door ! I 'm really getting a hard-on for this thing . " <p> A worker plugs in the new one and flips on the power settings for the freezer , meat drawer , and the main compartment . <p> " Is it working ? I ca n't hear anything . " <p> " Yeah , it 's working . Absolute quiet . Is n't it great ? And black is a good color , do n't you think ? Black , sleek lookin ' . Pretty cool , huh ? " <p> Bobby pays the delivery people with a roll of crisp hundred-dollar bills . " Thanks a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extra hundred . " And here , my good friends , is a little kiss good-bye . A little shoeshine money . Such fast and courteous service . The world needs more people who take special pains and do things right . " The two delivery men hang their heads , smiling nervously while Bobby squeezes his roll like a tennis ball and grinds his teeth . Finally he turns away from them and , bowing , they back out of the house . <p> Jeez ! The size of that roll made her paranoid . Bobby had to be printing money again . Thirty-four months in prison and he comes out and starts committing a federal crime . He would never learn . The diamond necklace , bought with phony money or stolen outright ? Do n't ask . It was merchandise . It gave her a small thrill to wear it , but she really did n't want the damn thing or the new refrigerator either . Ultimately it would be nothing but guilt and depression . It was sad to see Bobby do this . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to drive him off with a lecture , though . And she had to get in her Carl and Maizie story . Those two were under her skin like bugs , but it was hard to talk about it with all of the refrigerator stuff going on . Her story was rambling and incoherent but Bobby was quick ; he got the gist of it . She felt better to get it out , and he did listen with empathy . He kissed her tears away and carried her to bed , pulled back the sheets , white satin sheets , and Bobby remembered . <p> " You still got a thing about white satin sheets . While I was in jail I thought of you sleeping in these sheets , me on muslin . " Christ , it had been so long since a man touched her she practically came when he picked her up . <p> So good to see him . Cripe . Japanese refrigerators . What a kickl Little unexpected good things sometimes came along when you thought it was all over . Real nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hung on . You never knew . <p> He said he 'd call after supper around nine , and the phone rings exactly at nine . " Hello , baby , what 's happening ? It 's me , the keed ! " Somebody actually , finally did something they promised they would do . <p> " Hi . " <p> But then he 's hasty , impatient . " What are you playing ! What 's that music ! " <p> " Mozart . " <p> " Mozart ? You must be in some slow-down time zone . Who 's got that kind of patience ? I remember the days when  --  shit , oh , you know . But time gallops , even in jail . A year is a day . " She heard him flip his Zippo , click the little carbon wheel , and heard the small dull bag of ignition , a small explosion , then heard him click the lighter shut and take a drag off a cigarette . He said , " Has what's-her-face , the helper , gone ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He really sucked on a cigarette . Really liked to smoke . He said , " Is n't it scary ? All alone for the night ? " <p> " No , this is the best time . Why did you rush off ? Why did you leave ? " <p> " I hate to admit it , but I had to score . This guy , your man , Carl , sounds like a real sleazeball if you ask me . I 'm really appalled by the way things have gone funny since I 've been away . You ca n't trust anybody anymore . Even square johns are going to shit . If I could get a passport , I 'd fucking emigrate . New Zealand . The last good place . Boring , but fucking safe . " <p> " Oh , God ! I 'm so messed up I ca n't think straight , " she said . <p> " Your best friend runs off with your boyfriend . I would guess you would be messed up . I do n't blame you . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Oh , God , she has n't got a clue . She 's out of it . Does n't know a thing . " <p> " What do you mean , does n't know ? They always know . I mean you ca n't imagine it because you 're in love with this guy . You 're blind to the whole deal . " <p> " Are n't you supposed to quit smoking when you 've got diabetes ? " <p> " Yes , God , oh fuck ; it 's one hundred times worse . Do n't say that ! <p> My doctor told me if I do n't quit I 'm a goner , but what can I do ? I ca n't drink . I ca n't eat . I 'm , like , going to smoke . I 'm a rebel . " <p> " The Leader of the Pack , " she said . <p> He laughed at this and went off on a rap . " Hey , man ! Hey , man ! Why don'chew get lost on that Kow-a-saki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece of shit , anyhow ? Lay out all that bread for your leathers , and ya mmm mmm rrrrrrr motorcycle boots , then you come ' round with a Kow-a-saki ! Wait till them skinheads catch you on that Jap motherfucker . " <p> " You inflicted that refrigerator on me and now you 're Jap-bashing ! " <p> He was laughing like a maniac . " Get you a Harley , man . Hey , man ! ' He 's a rebel and he 'll never be any good . ' Born to raise hell . Drank two double espressos tonight . I 'm ready for the emergency room . Like crystal meth would make me calm in this situation . I order decaf , but they gave me straight . Eee-yow ! You think I was revved up this afternoon ? Man , I 'm wild now . " <p> " I 've got downers , " she said . " You could have asked me . I miss you . " <p> " I 'm ready to fly out the window ! Carl , man . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells you that he does n't like having such a ' limited ' relationship and he does n't want to see you again ? " <p> " And Maizie is in love and I have to listen to her because I 'm still dependent on her . She 's my driver , my lifeline , and I have to listen to her goo-goo horseshit . God ! I just want to strangle them both . Somebody ought to take those two cocksuckers out in the desert and set them on fire . " <p> " She 's goo-goo ' cause he took her to heaven . You know what I mean ? He took her to heaven , " Bobby said . <p> " Burn them ! A kerosene necklace . I am serious , " she shouted . <p> " I know you are . Your whole life you have to be genial and pleasant . From day one you have to be nice , but you are n't a dependent person really ... actually . I mean if you could move around , if you were mobile , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " That 's it , Bobby . You got it I have to play nice . I 'm sick of it . Make me normal for half an hour and those two are toasted . I would operate outside the boundaries of conventional morality . " <p> " The female Steven Seagal ! " <p> " God , make me normal for a half hour ! Havoc and mayhem . " <p> " When I came by this afternoon it was like nice , but I got going on that refrigerator thing , I was exhausted , and that refrigerator was driving-me crazy . I would never allow that kind of noise in my own house . Fucking violating me like that . America is finished but she do n't give a shit , she 's in Carl and Maizie land . Carl took her to heaven , do n't you know . That 's why she 's goo-goo . Ai n't nobody ever take you to heaven ! Set ' em on fire , " he laughed . " I mean you do n't let people walk on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're saying . " <p> " I 've never been like this . I 'm so full of hate . I am almost afraid of all the hate and meanness I have inside , " she said . <p> " Remember that time out in the backyard when I had drunk around the clock and showed up drunk and . we drank that whiskey and then we went and got more ? We went down to the bar together and you kept pissing about how I was going to dump the wheelchair . But I had presence of mind . I was n't that drunk . You were pissed . I saw ' set ' em on fire ' that night . " <p> She sighed . " That was a great night . I think about that night all the time . I do n't remember anything about getting pissed . " <p> " That was the night that defined my life . Actions proceeded from that night from which there was no turning back . When I was in the joint I played the guitar riff from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discovered the meaning of life . I do n't know about Mozart , but I do know rock ' n ' roll . I know all about the thing in itself which exists in all things-this evil thing , this will to live on a planet where all is so goddamn nasty . Pain is the positive thing , the essential thing . " She heard the Zippo click again . " Last night I drove by the Whiskey A Go Go . What a bummer . You ever see Enrique or Way-out Willie anymore ? Hey , c'm on , baby . You did n't even know Carl then , and we had our laughs . We had good times . He was n't even in the picture . This big hurt is going to pass off , believe me . " <p> " Enrique is in prison , " she said . " Willie , I do n't know . " She could picture him with the cigarette perched in the center of his mouth . He did n't handle cigarettes like a normal person ; he sucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bobby would practically eat a cigarette . <p> She took a sip from her bedside wineglass , popped down a couple Dramamine along with four Stelazine tablets . Robin's-egg blue pills chased with more wine . She wanted it to seem like old times , but things change . The image of him smoking made him seem so seedy . The gold lower-left eyetooth , the long fingernails with dirt under them . Stovepipe pants , white Converse sneakers . An expensive navy blazer , white shirt , conservative tie . Professional thief . Counterfeiter . But then she thought of Carl . Carl was a square , there was no denying . <p> " Hey , you 'll get over this , " he said . " Men are jerks . When I left for Australia , I had no idea I was hurting you . I thought we were just friends . I can only see the love thing in retro . You 're at that point where you do n't think you can get over it again . You can do it once , twice , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Does that make any sense ? " <p> " I do n't know , " she said . " I do n't know if I can make it anymore . " <p> " To give someone trust or credibility , you listen to them and then buy into what they tell you . After they become your friend , you take on faith whatever else they may be pushing . Then they start lying and you believe them because you need to believe . If that was his picture in your room , the dude 's a total square , baby . A man involved in real estate . White-on-white tie . Diamond rings . How could you fall for a straight john like that ? Well , that 's water over the bridge . Then suddenly  --  whoa ! This other passion is cooking for Maizie . They 're probably surprised to know you got hurt feelings ! " <p> She finished off her glass of wine and felt it warm her . It was a subject she was sick of yet obsessed with , and this was another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , but she was just so sick of it all . <p> " I mean , he 's probably got an old rubber in his wallet  --  just in case . They fuck , maybe do some oral . They 're really feeling up because they 're doing something clandestine  --  naughty , sneaky . What a thrill . I mean now he 's cheating at least two ways and this is really exciting . Are you feeling angry ? " <p> " That , " she said , " but more objective than usual . Disgusted . " <p> " Fucking like a couple of dogs in heat . Get out a hose . You know , everybody does it , but they do n't want the world to see it . And the reason they do n't want the world to see it is because love manifested on this vibration is of a low order . It really is n't love , it 's just lust , one of the four cardinal vices in the Buddhist scheme . Do n't you just envy them ! " " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Three ? " <p> " Cardinal vices ? " <p> " Anger , avarice , and indolence . The cardinal virtues are chastity , generosity , gentleness , and humility . " <p> " What are the Christian virtues ? " <p> " What is this ? You tell me . " <p> " Faith , love , hope . " <p> " I 'm not a Christian , but it seems to me that if you can have sympathy for another human being , the walls break down . You want me to do a job on Carl ? " <p> " Women do n't think like men , " she said . " Anyhow , you said he took her to heaven . She acts like she is in heaven . Do n't try to give me aversion therapy  --  " <p> " You say you wan na set them on fire out in the desert  --  that 's the downside of all this shit . Part and parcel . That 's all I 'm saying . Think of them like dogs in heat , it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get involved with a married guy . " <p> " I always imagined being carried away by the passion . Swept up in kisses . You 're wrecking the whole deal for me . " <p> " This is not Gone with the Wind . This is a couple of dogs in heat . <p> These two are bad . Give me the match . Has Carl got kids ? " <p> " Three . " <p> " That selfish prick . He 's got kids ? That 's splashing bad karma all over the place . Your boy Carl is a wrecking crew . He 's screwed you over because he has this feeling for Maizie . You know how much time it takes to carry on an affair ! Poor Carl , he needs this and he needs that . Fucks his kids , fucks his wife , fucks you  --  he 's a sorry motherfucker . And you feel guilty crapping around with a married guy , right ? You are not without blame . I get caught boosting and I do my time . I know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're right , " she said absently . " He always needs this and that . " <p> " And he did n't have the balls to come right out with it . He 's doing it incrementally . I ought to go over there now and kick the shit out of him . Where does he live ? I 'll drag his ass out of the house and lay a number on him . " <p> " I 'd like that . " <p> " You 're a barracuda . I 'm not lying . Little Anthony and the Imperials , ' Tears on my pillow , pain in my heart '  --  that ai n't you . Steven Seagal , I 'm not lyin ' . Where does he live ? I 'll get him tonight . " <p> " Thank you , " she said , " but no . I do n't want him hurt , I guess . It was horrible . Now I feel better . It 's good to hear your voice . It does n't seem like twenty years , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The conversation was going nowhere for her . She was engulfed in a wave of desolation . Bobby kept on talking . <p> " But there were troubles yesterday . We always got troubles . Walk around on this planet and you 're gon na have troubles . Only the mind does amazing things . It forgets the pain . You see pictures of people in a death camp  --  some guy points a camera at them and they smile , or somebody shows you a picture of Johnny and he 's smiling and somebody says , ' Yeah , we took that shot of him four days before he blew his head off with the twelve-gauge . ' Life is tricky that way . Fools you . I could do it , you know . I could blow my head off right now . " She sensed real anguish in his voice but could n't think of anything positive to say . There was a long pause . <p> " When Johnny gets on the other side , what happens ? " she asked . <p> " Nothing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just like that . " He spoke with authority . With confidence and utter self-assurance . <p> " What if Johnny gets over to the other side and finds himself in a pile of shit  --  a pile of shit he ca n't get out of ? " <p> " No , baby , this is it . What you see is what you get . You get this . So anyhow , Johnny with his twelve gauge . Maybe somebody says a certain thing and he do n't take out the shotgun but three years later gets cancer of the pancreas . Do n't have the nerve to die now . Do n't got the balls for it anymore . Suffers . Like big-time , excruciating pain . You know ? Should have shot himself then . The part of him that can see in the future told him then . I 'm not saying you should always follow your heart , but these unconscious drives are probably more correct than we will ever know . " <p> She took the heavy receiver and shifted it to her other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she reached over with her right hand and poured herself another glass of wine . She opened the drawer on her night table and pulled out her stash . She could n't believe what she was doing . The plan . Her grand inspiration was fast becoming a reality . She never thought she could pull it off , but she was doing it , taking charge . <p> " I could never shoot myself , " she said . <p> " I could , and I 've got a gun that is big enough to do it right , " he said . Either the Dramamine was hitting her fast or it was just the contact high . Had to be a contact high . She picked up four more Stelazine tablets and swallowed them with the wine . Like Dramamine , Stelazine had an anti-nausea effect ; it would keep her from puking . Plus , it could really make you blotto . She looked at her stash . Her cache of Librium , glossy black and green capsules , five hundred or more ; Valiums in blue ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ludiomils in good-morning-sunshine orange ; tricolored Tuinal in red , redder , and baby blue ; drab brown Triavil in the 4-10 proportion ; there were pastel orange methadone diskets ( just two of them ass kickers ) ; some chalk-white meprobamate in the generic  --  wipe you out for sure ; multicolored Dexedrine spansules ; passionate purple Parnate ; there were her Nembutals and the sea-green , **25;156;TOOLONG Placidyl gel caps ( Baby Dills ) . The pills suddenly became an object of beauty , a treasure . It was better than unearthing a pirate captain 's sea chest filled with glittering gold doubloons and shimmering jewels : emeralds , rubies , diamonds , and chips of anthracite coal-better because pills did things . They could alter the worst sensation permanently . They would do so presently . All you had to do was swallow . What a relief to finally end it . The richness and depth of color of the pills , pills so beautiful they made her hair hurt . <p> Maybe it was the wine . No , really , it was the Dramamine hitting home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super fast . No Stelazine action yet , the feeling was definitely Dramamine . She would have to make fast work of the Librium , and after she asked him what time his plane took off she began swallowing the various pills and capsules with wine , ten at a time . It was like working on an assembly line , and her hand began to tire . She got down thirty and had to rest a moment . She poured another glass of wine and was quickly back at it . This was her job . Her last job . <p> She heard the Zippo go off again . He was smoking . Thinking . There was too much dead space . He did n't know what to say . He was trying to psych her up and was out of gas himself . He did n't realize that he had made the final act possible . She was proud of herself . Your friends do sometimes come through . <p> At last Bobby said , " You soundin ' zone , baby . " <p> " I 'm straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me slur .

I ai n't even expecting it , " he says . <p> " Jeez , you sent me a postcard from Kinshasa . What a great stamp . I got that card and I could n't believe it  --  the Congo . I thought : He 's in the Congo having an adventure and I 'm stuck here . I used to wait for your letters . One week you were in Africa and the next week it was Finland .

She could see that it was impossible to take all of them , but at least the barbiturates were in , the methadone was in , most of the Valium . Her stomach felt like a bowling ball . But she did n't feel that fucked up . When was it going to hit ? Why had n't it hit ? What had happened ? When was this fucking show going to end ? She pulled out a half pint of Gordon 's gin and grabbed another handful of poison . It was time to get serious . You could never be too sure . A big wave hit her and suddenly she felt like she was blowing out to sea . It was a good feeling . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he was a million miles away . He sounded desperate .

Was this just a hysterical gesture ? <p> " Fifteen years ' worth . Are you serious ? " <p> " Why ? " <p> He sounded scared . " Well , ' cause I just called to say good-bye .

Just you . I love you , Bobby . " <p> The ice cubes clinking again . A big pause . " I love you , too . " <p> Another wave swept over her , leaving her calm and unafraid . It seemed like a long time had passed . " Are you on the nod ? " she slurred . <p> " Shot some scag . Mozart  --  " he said . There was a long pause . She punched the remote a couple of times . It was too much effort to speak . The CD changer clicked and suddenly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A very long time before , it had been their song . She let the phone drop . <p> It took considerable effort but she was able to pulp down a last few swallows of gin and edge over away from the side of the bed . Some of the liquor rolled off her chin , down her neck , over the satin pillowcase . Her special crystal nightcap goblet fell to the hardwood floor and smashed . Day keeper would find the necklace and sell it . Land her ass in jail . <p> Shit . Bobby did n't know the first thing about prison . Spent half his life behind bars and what did he know ! She knew what it was like to fall back into the darkness . To implode nights and come to every morning like reconstituted misery . Come crawling back in the day cell of a puny withering body . She knew all about black holes . She knew all about prison , about clocks and calendars . She knew single soul-crushing seconds that lasted months of Sundays . She knew second-hand sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty lifetimes of Methuselah ; weeks that tormented like furnace years on the surface of Mercury . All the while thinking " Why me ? " and " Poor me . " She had heard the silence of the moon reflected in still mountain lakes , and that did not change a thing . Nothing was altered . It was a very bad deal , and then on top of everything else you had to die . Why has God done this thing to me ? <p> She had never been up for any of this . Thanks to all of the pills and booze there was , at last , that wonderful sense of detachment . She could take the scissors and cut the cord any time now . Should have done it years ago , but finally the sentence was almost completed . <p> She blacked out . The sound of a gunshot through the telephone brought her around . God ! Bobby ! <p> " Nights in White Satin " was still playing on the CD . She had hit the replay button a dozen times , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for Mozart but ... Bobby . Shit , Bobby . He was just a friend , but a friend was a better thing than a lover . More valuable . In the long run take a friend , a really good friend , any day . Maybe it would be like spirits and shit , and she and Bobby would meet and be together again with fresh young healthy bodies . After all , they were checking out together , practically within the same hour . She hoped he had the soul strength to hold it together and wait for her . Some of them just evaporated and disappeared and others turned into angels . How did she know that ? Suddenly she knew that . God , what if she ended up in a horrible pile of shit on the other side ? An eternal pile of shit ? No . The only hell she would ever know was about to end . In fact , it was over . She felt warmth and love . She wondered if there was a heaven . Seemed very likely now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt light . She felt warm . It was good . <p> Thom Jones is the author of The Pugilist at Rest , a collection of short stories .
