This special issue on California fulfills a long-standing ambition of mine : to explain this amazing state to a national and international audience that knows it better for its cliches than for its complexity . My colleagues jokingly say I 'm interested mainly because I grew up in San Francisco . I suppose there 's some truth to that , if only because the changes in the state are all the more overwhelming to someone who knew it in the 1950s and ' 60s . <P> Any biases I may have were offset by senior editor Jack White , a North Carolinian who got some exposure to the Golden State when he lived in Fresno in the ' 60s . Jack put this issue together with the expert guidance of executive editor Ron Kriss , who still regrets leaving the home he owned in Sausalito when he lived there as executive editor of Saturday Review in the early 1970s . <P> Most of the stories were written and reported by our correspondents and reporters in Los Angeles and San Francisco , under the supervision of West Coast bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the late ' 60s , when he was bureau chief for LIFE magazine ; he returned three years ago after a foreign career that had taken him to London , Rome and Paris . " How much farther from Europe can you get ? " he asks . For San Francisco correspondents this week after a total of eight years ( in two stints ) in the City by the Bay . Of all the photographers represented in this issue , none was more thrilled by the assignment than P.F. Bentley , a resident of Stinson Beach , Calif . <P> As we were completing this issue , we received sad news : a dear colleague , Robert T. Zintl Jr. , 44 , died suddenly on Tuesday working in his office in Rome , where he was bureau chief . Terry , as his friends called him , went to Italy a year ago after five years editing in our Nation section and nine months as deputy managing editor of the New York Daily News . Terry was a natural journalist , always curious and professional , devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time &; Life Building in New York City and on the Via Sardegna in Rome . We will miss him immensely .
