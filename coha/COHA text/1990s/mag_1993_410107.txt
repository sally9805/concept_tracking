Slava , our interpreter , meets us after the last airport bottleneck . Armed with platefuls of salted beef and sardines , he 's trying to soften us up before announcing the problem : It 's Women 's Appreciation Day , and the helicopter pilots are all home appreciating their women . No skiing today . Just great ! We are in Alma Ata , Kazakhstan , having flown halfway around the world to heli-ski the Tien Shan mountains in Kyrgyzstan , to the south . Old cold-war politics kept people away until just a few years ago , and the area is so remote that the mountains have for the most part been explored very little and skied even less . I am here with a small group courtesy of Rob Jutson , a New Yorker who is planning to start a heli-skiing operation in the Tien Shan . He has also brought along Ueli Frei , a mountain guide from Grindelwald , Switzerland , who scouted part of the area last year . That night we go to a Women 's Appreciation Day party and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel tired , overappreciated , and eager to ski the next day , so I crash early . A quick breakfast of fermented cow intestine and we 're set . Now all we need is the helicopter . We hang out in a field for an hour before the copter shows up , chasing sheep and taking pictures of each other chasing sheep . When the helicopter , an enormous beast of a machine finally does land , my jaw drops . It 's huge  --  three-bedrooms two-baths huge . The pilot , Alexi , is wearing a perfectly pressed military uniform and looks confident , so we load our gear and jump on . We find space between a few 250-gallon drums of sloshing kerosene , open some windows , and off we go . Around us , mean-looking mountains span an area the size of the Alps . Jutson has an arrangement with the government that allows him to set his helicopters down anywhere in Kyrgyzstan , a 76,100-square-mile republic . We get to take the helicopter , point at any mountain , ski it , and name the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've come from halfway around the world , we feel willing to take a few risks . ( Apparently the snow is most stable here in the summer . ) Ueli is first , and he skis cautiously through a long , narrow 40-degree chute . I start next and make it two thirds of the way down when I feel the slope move ; I look back and see slabs of snow breaking and pushing around me . Avalanche . What can you do ? Going really fast , somehow I surf around rocks and out of the slide just before it starts folding over on itself . I look back up the hill and laugh , trying to shake off my adrenaline . The guys name the run Svetlana after someone they met on Women 's Appreciation Day . I spend the next few days flying with my nose pressed against the window , like a kid being driven past Disneyland . We pass up the wilder lines because the snow conditions are n't safe , but we still sometimes find deep creamy powder , sometimes frozen chicken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some unknown reason was built to resemble a ship . On the first bad-weather day , our last day in Kyrgyzstan , we party in an unfinished hotel room with a bunch of local construction workers . Someone hands me a dirty glass with one inch of clear liquid rolling in the bottom . I 'm told it 's vodka , but it smells like paint thinner . There 's a pickle jar of the stuff on the floor . I watch one of my fellow heli-skiers as he dutifully drinks from his glass ; maybe he wants to flush the paint from his system . I take a sip and immediately contort my face . For a good 15 seconds I gurgle , clutching for air . No wonder they 're always short on helicopter fuel : They must drink it . The room we 're in is small , and there are seven or eight local guys all laughing and carrying on in a dirty old man kind of way . They 're wearing painter 's overalls , which confirms the beverage of choice . The only other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her mouth full of gold teeth . Then with her bare hands , she twists an apple right in half . I leave the construction party behind . I have my heart set on a one-dollar massage from the sanatorium specialist . I strip down and lay on a plastic couch . In walks the specialist . He 's one of the drunk construction workers from the party . I 'd leave , but I 'm so nervous and sweaty that I stick to the plastic on the couch . Actually it 's a good massage , except he does n't use any oil , only soap and water . This gives me quite a headache . The soap is such a good lubricant that his hands keeps slipping , overshooting my back and whacking me in the head . At dinner we keep trying to twist apples in half with our bare hands . We attempt to fly to the airport in Alma Ata in the helicopter , but have to land on a farm to wait out the fog . We sit eating packaged military meals and stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us wants to leave . For information on Tien Shan Powderbirds , call Triwest Marketing , 214-987-2772 . <p>
