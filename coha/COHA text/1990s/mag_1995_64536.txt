Win a major golf championship ? There must have been days when Steve Elkington was n't sure he could go on playing golf at all . // This is a guy who must roll up his sleeves twice a week , swab a little alcohol on his triceps and stick himself full of allergy serum . You do n't often see this : a golfer allergic to grass . A cop allergic to doughnuts. // Sounds funny , but even his wife , Lisa , walks out of the room for this part . She can handle 5 ? - hour sinus surgeries and constant infections and bouts with viral meningitis and searing headaches . But sometimes her eyes have seen too much . // Come from six strokes back on the last day , post an electric 64 and win a Maalox playoff ? Are you kidding ? This is a guy who had to step away from a few shots last week during the PGA Championship at Riviera because the ground was spinning . He had withdrawn from the Buick the week before with a sinus infection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't sure he could get out of bed . // Reel in a god-in-waiting like Ernie Els on the last nine holes of regulation and then break portly Colin Montgomerie 's heart with a birdie on the 73rd ? Please . This is a guy who probably does n't even belong in the sun . When doctors found melanoma on him last year , it meant removal of a surgical chunk out of his shoulder the size of a mown-in-half golf ball and the start of quarterly checkups. // But on Sunday in Pacific Palisades , Calif. , Elkington stifled the sneezes , the runny noses and the congestion and became the guy who breathed his fondest wish . In a performance that matched the skinniest numbers in the history of golf 's majors  --  68-67-68-64-267  --  he rotogravured his name on the Wanamaker Trophy . // O.K. , so maybe history will giggle at this one . They 'll cough at the crummy attendance , ahem at the obscene scoring ( four 64s , two 63s and the lowest scoring average , 71.09 , in major history ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead . And they 'll point out that everybody was treating it more as a qualifier for next month 's Ryder Cup at Oak Hill in Rochester , N. Y. // Well , maybe it was that , too . For the Americans this was the last chance to score real points for the 10 guaranteed spots and brownie points with captain Lanny Wadkins , who had two wild-card picks . Brad Faxon had tried Plan B : the power suck-up . At Phoenix he handed Wadkins a plate of cookies with milk and complimented his swing . Did n't work . Wadkins hinted it would be best if Faxon played his way on . He had tried Plan C : hope . His wife , Bonnie , is due with their third child on Sept. 18 , the Monday of Ryder Cup week . The Faxons arranged to induce labor on the 11th , just in case . // But by Saturday night Faxon 's options seemed shot . He was in 21st place , so he went back to Plan A : finish fifth and make the team on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major-record 28 on the front nine and poured in a 17-foot par putt on the 18th to cap a sporty 63 , which put him in , voila , fifth place . After he had made one of the greatest Ryder Cup qualification runs  --  and joined Jeff Maggert , whose third-place tie leapfrogged him from 11th onto the team  --  somebody asked Faxon why he wanted to make it so badly . // " Free clothes , " he said . // Wadkins used his two picks to take a strange couple  --  Curtis Strange and Fred Couples . The former has n't won in this decade , and the latter has played in only six events since the Masters . But Strange brings a legacy to Oak Hill , where he won his last U.S. Open in 1989 . And Couples brings all that talent . // As does Els . Riviera appeared reserved for the big-boned 25-year-old magnificently drowsy South African , ambling along in his bovine way , as if any minute he might lie down in the kikuyu grass and make animals in the clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 11 under after two days and had owned it flat out after three at 16 under , three strokes and miles ahead of everybody else . // " Considering the way the course is playing and the way you 're playing , is n't a three-shot lead insurmountable ? " a distaff reporter asked him Saturday night . To which Els wrinkled his nose and replied , ' " Have you been around , lady ? " // But when he and his documented standing-50 pulse began on Sunday by making an easy birdie at the par-5 1st hole and taking a four-shot lead into the 3rd , it looked as if Els would become the first man since one Jack William Nicklaus to win two majors by the age of 25. // But then someone Els seemed to take over . He bogeyed the arduous 4th and the easy 6th , the green with a bunker in the middle of it . On the 9th he saw Elkington had caught him . At the 10th he noticed he was behind . His 72 was two too many and looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already put up , all of which caused him to retire to the clubhouse for some cold ones . " What the hell do you want me to say ? " he moaned . " It was a hard situation . " He took a powerful chug and looked at his shoes . " Next time . " // For once , next time felt like right now to Elkington , the Australian who has grown to hate the question , " So , what is Greg Norman really like ? " " I was just swinging so good , " he said . Of course Elkington always swings good . His golf swing is something of an aria , named in a players ' poll as one of the three best on Tour . " God , " said one player , " can you imagine living with that ? " // The difference this time was that his putting stroke was just as good . His next-door neighbor and longtime mentor in Houston , 1956 PGA champion Jackie Burke , had found a flaw during Elkington 's back-nine struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two back despite  --  surprise  --  hitting one approach after another within the shadow of the flag-stick . He was n't releasing the putter , Burke scolded . This was news ? Elkington came to Riviera ranked 133rd on the Tour in putting . // Suddenly he was pouring in putts . In fact , nobody had fewer putts for the week than Elkington 's 106 . Montgomerie had 14 more . And Sunday , when he birdied seven of the first 12 holes , Elkington was away by two . // Then Montgomerie , a boy fairly weaned on golf-course grass , the son of the secretary at Scotland 's Royal Troon , began his own scorched-cup tour . He birdied the 16th and 17th . And as Elkington sat in the scorer 's booth watching on TV , the Scot thumped in a 20-footer on the 18th. // Elkington came out of the booth and looked for Lisa and their four-month-old , Annie , took them over to a shady spot and changed a diaper . " I just had to be alone with them for a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year . // The players were trundled back to the 18th tee in separate carts , Cushman gladiators on a verdant Hollywood set under sky painted overly blue . It was a one-picture deal , Elkington playing the hero and Monty , naturally , the heavy . // Both creased perfect drives and very good eight-irons . Elkington 's ball stopped on the same line Montgomerie 's had been on 15 minutes before . Elkington knew that putt . He had watched it on TV . Just Monty 's luck . Impaled on his own skewer. // The 25-footer practically sank itself , marching obediently into the left side of the cup . Elkington leaped and with two hands held the putter over his head like a lance . Elated and dazed , he then squatted to the left of the green , closed his eyes and " tried to get my heart rate down . " // To Montgomerie it was as familiar as heartburn . Four times before he had been in a playoff , and four times he had lost , including to Els at the 1994 U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pebble Beach that Nicklaus congratulated him on winning before Tom Kite stole it . Now another major was going into the dumpster just behind Hogan 's Alley . // He waited for the crowd to settle . He looked at Elkington , and he looked at Elkington 's caddie , Dave Renwick , the caddie he could have had last year when Renwick parted with Jose Maria Olazabal . In five majors since , Elkington and Renwick have gone seventh , fifth , 36th , sixth and what sure looked like first . And guess what ? Renwick is a Scot . // Montgomerie looked at the putt from all sides and stepped up . Somewhere in the silence of the moment , way above the green , up the 53 steps to the famous clubhouse , a baby was crying . // Annie . Early voting : Baby of the Year . // After she stopped , Montgomerie missed the putt inches to the right , let his double chin drop to his sunken chest , shook hands with Elkington , walked to the side of the green where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kicked the flagstick and turned three shades past his original ruddy , right onto eggplant. // " You could not have done any better , " he said to nobody in particular as he climbed those suddenly endless steps . " You live your whole life , and it depends on one putt , and ... it was all out of my hands . " Can a guy be allergic to majors ? // For Elkington the best day , the clearest day , the most wonderful day had finally arrived . " This , " he said , " is the moment I 've waited for . I just ca n't believe my name is going to be on that trophy , especially on there with Jackie Burke's. " // And as he held Lisa and Annie close with one hand and the fattest trophy in golf with the other , Elkington seemed to get a little watery-eyed , and he looked a little dizzy , and his throat got kind of scratchy. // Dang allergies.               @ @ @ @ @ @
