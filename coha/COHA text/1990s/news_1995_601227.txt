<p> Sales of sport-utility vehicles are going crazy , while the rest of the car and truck market founders . <p> The numbers have truck sellers on twinkle toes . Chevrolet Tahoe sales boomed 404% in June vs. a year earlier as buyers embraced a newly designed four-door model . The redesigned GMC Jimmy was up 73% in June . Jeep Grand Cherokee , up 44% . Ford Explorer , up 43% . Toyota Land Cruiser , up 37% . And on and on . The first six months , sport utility sales were 14% ahead of last year - enough to keep the overall light-truck market flat with last year despite falling sales of vans and some pickups . The car and truck market , meantime , is down 3% . <p> Sport utilities clearly are the hottest things on wheels . But theirs is a sales boom with an undercurrent of bust . It turns out that the robust sales have as much to do with price as product . A nationwide survey for USA TODAY uncovered huge discounts on sport utilities - even those most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the discounts are likely to get bigger because manufacturers will glut the already crowded market with a batch of new sport utilities the next couple years . <p> Look what the survey of dealers found : Ford Explorers $ 100 less than dealer invoice cost . Jeep Grand Cherokees and Honda Passports at invoice . Chevy Tahoe four-doors just $ 300 more than invoice . Even Land Rover 's Discovery is thousands less than sticker price . Last year you not only had to pay more than sticker for a Discovery , you had to get on a waiting list for the privilege . <p> But , boy , have things changed the past few months as manufacturers flooded a seemingly insatiable sport-utility market . " I have n't had a dealer yet who has n't told me , ' I have a whole ton of these to move , ' " says Robert Ellis at CarBargains , the Washington shopping service that compiled prices for USA TODAY . <p> So far , dealers have been doing most of the discounting without help from automakers . Only six of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a factory-to-dealer incentive . And there were no factory-to-consumer rebates . <p> Dealers are in the trenches and can see that there is so much competition , and that automakers are cranking out so many sport utilities , that they have to keep the hardware moving off their lots . So - for demanding shoppers - dealers are cutting their profits and passing along most or all the sales incentives they get from the manufacturers . <p> They 're hardly going broke , by the way , selling at or below invoice cost . The invoice amount includes not only the cost of the vehicle , but also an amount to cover dealer advertising and a secret profit - called holdback - of up to 3% . <p> Still , sport utility discounts seem to be getting more generous by the week . <p> Automakers have boosted factory capacity devoted to sport utilities close to 50% the past year . And they plan at least 11 new sport-utility models the next two years . Four more are likely if their makers sense the sales momentum will continue . That would mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models of sport utilities , more than quadrupling the number of sport-utility models since the Jeep Cherokee four-door began to make trucks a respectable alternative to cars a decade ago . <p> " Any niche that shows signs of momentum gets four or five new models . The sport-utility segment is a magnet for new products , " says auto consultant Susan Jacobs of New Jersey . <p> Jacobs , whose specialty is the luxury market , says the sport-utility boom has been fueled lately by people crossing over from high-price cars to fancy trucks . <p> A prime example of that is trend-watcher George Peterson , who runs California-based auto consulting firm AutoPacific . He recently dumped his BMW 7-series luxury sedan and jumped into a two-wheel-drive Grand Cherokee . The main reason was price : a lease payment of just $ 207 a month for 24 months . " Ca n't beat it , " he says . <p> Plus , he gets benefits that have made sport utilities a rave . " I do n't give up anything in image . I can carry my bike wherever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Peterson says . <p> Hot prices that CarBargains found are n't gimmes . You 'll have to work to get them . In fact , dealers probably will tell you that sport utilities are in such demand that you 'll pay dearly , have to wait , and might not get exactly what you want . But the bids that CarBargains got from dealers , and experiences of recent buyers , say otherwise . <p> Judy Zopp , a marketing director in Deerfield , Ill. , replaced her loaded Chrysler LeBaron with a Ford Explorer , for $ 200 more than dealer invoice - close to rock bottom . <p> On her first visits to Ford , Chevy and Jeep dealers , " They told me these things are going like hot cakes and we wo n't be doing a lot of dickering . " Skeptical , Zopp bought dealer-pricing information and bargaining advice from Fighting Chance , a California-based car-shopping service . Thus armed , she quickly cut through the nonsense and got several bids close to dealer invoice . Dealers , she concluded , " need to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an informed consumer . " <p> Wyoming geologist Betty Stroock bought a Jeep Grand Cherokee Laredo - one of the hottest models - for just $ 300 more than dealer invoice . " They started high , close to the sticker price , because I 'm a woman . But when I showed them the paperwork with the dealer cost , they came down in a hurry . I 'd done my homework . " And when acquaintance Dave Love needed a new Jeep , Stroock photocopied her deal and Love used it to get the same price at a different dealership . <p> Analysts say tough-minded consumers - more common now than ever - will combine with the glut of sport utilities to keep real-world prices down , no matter what sticker prices manufacturers slap on the windows . <p> Automakers are n't blind to the big discounts and the potential glut . But they 're optimistic nonetheless . Says Ford Motor Vice President Keith Magee , head of the Lincoln and Mercury brands , both planning new sport utilities soon : " We do think it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with younger people and they say once they get into the ( higher ) income levels , this is the type vehicle they want . " Sport utilities will continue to be popular , he says , because " they 're practical and they have the image . That 's why the segment is growing . " <p> And how can you blame automakers when you see the potentially huge profits ? Sport utilities , relatively cheap and easy to build , can earn car companies roughly twice as much profit as a typical family car . That 's the kind of big bucks that once came only from luxury car sales . Luxury cars are n't selling well , so automakers flock to models that promise the same profits . An oversupply of sport utilities could force manufacturers into giving rebates and weaken profits . <p> Even without a choking glut and rebates , one sport utility threatens pricing and profits of its rivals . The Mercedes-Benz AAV , for All-Activity Vehicle , is expected to start at $ 30,000 . " If you 've got a Mercedes at $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " how are you going to sell Explorer Limiteds at $ 36,000 ?
