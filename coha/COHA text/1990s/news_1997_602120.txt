<p> FRANKFURT , Germany  --  If anyone still needs proof that global strategies are a critical weapon in the auto industry 's battle for buyers , visit the atrium of Frankfurt 's airport . <p> There you 'll find a car covered by a Stars and Stripes quilt . The accompanying poster reads : " Are you ready to meet the American challenge ? " Underneath sits the 1998 Cadillac Seville , redesigned to meet international demands ranging from emissions to switch positioning . <p> Unveiling this U.S.-made car not on home turf but here at the mammoth biennial Frankfurt International Motor Show  --  which opens today and ends Sept. 21  --  General Motors concedes that not aggressively courting buyers outside the U.S. market is a failed policy of the past . <p> " We thought we 'd do great in this business forever , no matter what happened , " says John F. Smith , Cadillac general manager . " We ignored trends . But we 're out of that dark period . " <p> Not a moment too soon . Competition is vicious . Automaking capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices and setting off a spotlight-seeking frenzy at shows like Frankfurt that used to attract little U.S. attention . <p> Performance-minded companies such as Audi and BMW are adding zip to swift sellers . Europeans will get a 265-horsepower A4 from Audi , called the S4 ; the world gets BMW 's Z3 M Coupe , a pocket rocket that pushes upwards of 240 horsepower . <p> Giants like Volkswagen are pushing the limits of platform sharing : The Audi A3 , Skoda Octavia and the redesigned Golf ride on the same frame , reducing labor and engineering costs . Porsche , which introduces the first water-cooled 911 sports car , is boosting profit by offering just two models . <p> But these heralded solutions lie beneath the sheet metal . <p> A far more obvious approach marks the dominant trend at this first and largest auto show of the season : making small cars as safe and well-equipped as larger models . This tactic is especially crucial in Europe , with its congested cities and small roads . Known in the industry as C-segment cars , these family hatchbacks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the new European offerings are GM 's Opel Astra and Renault 's Megane Scenic . <p> But the segment is ruled by the mighty Golf , with 18 million sold to date , whose fourth incarnation is among 33 premieres here . In Europe , its principal market , VW hopes to sell 700,000 Golfs a year . It makes its debut in the USA next year . <p> " We are stealing a page from BMW 's stylebook in that there is little change ( to the shape ) , " says VW Group chairman Ferdinand Piech . <p> Indeed , VW has taken a conservative approach to the new model . The car features the same upright stance it has had since 1974 , albeit with technical and interior refinements that include four air bags and rain-sensitive wipers . <p> Futuristic fun <p> But a handful of other new cars in this class threaten to steal the new Golf 's thunder . They 're led by the Mercedes-Benz A-class , and represent a cartoon vision of the future . <p> " I hope they predict a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Jean Lindamood Jennings , deputy editor of Automobile magazine . These modular cars could be able to change color or format to suit your needs . <p> The A-class does just that , currently offered in 23 color combinations . And although no larger than a Golf , it features removable seats that turn the car from people mover to antiques hauler in minutes . Perhaps foreshadowing its prominence in Europe , the A-class display here threatens to outdraw that of another Mercedes newcomer , the U.S.-built M-class sport-utility vehicle . <p> A-class imitators dot the Frankfurt show , from Toyota 's Funtime prototype to Audi 's proposed aluminum-bodied AL2 . Each features the same exceptional ride height , due , in the case of the A-class , not to high ground clearance but placement of the engine under the driver 's seat . <p> One car that hopes to steal customers from this futuristic lot is the Land Rover Freelander . Aimed at the mini-sport-utility market , currently occupied by the Honda CRV and Toyota RAV4 , the Freelander is designed less for off-roading than highway driving . Around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's a lighter-duty vehicle , " says Land Rover 's Andy Hurst , adding that a new fully independent suspension means softer rides than one normally associates with Land Rover . " We hope it brings us a contemporary feel and new customers . " <p> Hurst says Freelander will be priced below the $ 30,000 entry-level Discovery ; no official word yet on whether the car will come to the USA , but some experts predict it will appear here next year . <p> They 're on the way <p> Stateside car fans who are in the market for new wheels will find a number of tasty Frankfurt offerings that are destined for U.S. auto shows and dealers in the coming months . Among the highlights : <p>  --  Porsche 911 . If you like Porsche 's Boxster coupe , you 'll go for the first redesign of the venerable 911 since its debut 34 years ago . <p> Both cars have the same frog-nosed face and interior appointments . Of note is a compression of the 911 's traditional five round gauges into semicircles . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the dials ; they used to be blocked by the steering wheel . <p> " You can look at the cars as one concept , " designer Harm Lagaay says of the company 's two products . " But they have different characters . One dances the tango and the other the samba . " <p> Expected in the USA in mid-1998 , this longer and more spacious 911 is an indication that even in formerly customer unfriendly Zuffenhausen , marketing needs are heeded . <p> Says Lagaay with a smile : " Porsche reacted slowly to golf players . " Now even a few sets of clubs fit behind the 911 's leather front seats . <p>  --  Saab 9 . Echoing Frankfurt 's global theme , 9 line executive Dan Chasins is eager to point out the world firsts on the company 's new sedan , which features a new platform and an all-independent rear suspension . <p> First on his list is the car 's engine , which in 3-liter , 6-cylinder guise is dubbed eco-power by Saab . The engine has a turbocharger that draws its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says makes for more power just when drivers need it most  --  in the passing lane . <p> Next on his list are active headrests that rise to meet the head in the case of a crash . And last is something that sounds so absurd it 's wonderful : optional power-ventilated seats . <p> " It helps eliminate that sticky back feeling , " Chasins says . <p> The 9 will start at $ 30,000 with a four-cylinder engine ; but optioned out , it comes into its own as a competitor to the Audi A6 and BMW 5-series . <p>  --  BMW Z3 M Coupe . Something strange is happening at BMW , a company whose cars generally are as zany as a crisply tailored suit . It is getting downright fun . Blame Chris Bangle and his team of designers . <p> The Munich auto giant recently introduced the Cruiser motorcycle ( aimed squarely at Harley fans ) , and now they offer the Z3 M Coupe from the Motorsports division , a throwback to MGC-T hatchback days if you factor in far more horsepower . <p> Beefy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no roof , the coupe features a squared-off lid , under which sit two passengers and perhaps a brave dog in the cargo hold . <p> Does anyone need a hatchback on steroids ? No . Will anyone want one ? Bangle is counting on the car making its sales on the road . <p> " Some people do n't like an open-top feeling ( found in the convertible Z3 ) , where everyone is looking at you , " says the animated designer . " But when you get in this car , and look into the rear-view mirror at speed , well you 'd swear that Steve McQueen was tailing you . " <p> The car should hit U.S. showrooms in a year , with a price likely hitting the high $ 30,000 end as with that of the swift Z3 M Roadster . <p>  --  Cadillac Seville . Cadillac hopes it has an answer for everyone who has ventured to Europe on vacation , rented a car and thought , " Why ca n't we build something like this ? " It 's the Seville STS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in made-over guise combines the car 's already noteworthy features ( namely a 305-hp Northstar engine ) with a world-conscious redesign that simply makes the car a bit more understated . <p> Japanese market considerations have caused the new Seville to shrink ( it is now 196 inches long ) , to meet parking requirements ( U.S. models are 5 inches longer to accommodate 5 mph crash bumpers ) . <p> Power-folding mirrors are standard because streets are narrower . The hazard switch has been moved from behind the steering wheel to the center console because foreign drivers often use hazards to signal other drivers while in motion . <p> Great expectations <p> The luxury-car segment worldwide accounts for 3 million sales annually , and experts predict a growth to 4 million . Cadillac 's current global sales total 35,000 . Expectations for the new Seville in Europe are a modest 2,500 sales next year , through about 100 of GM 's best Opel and Vauxhall dealers . <p> " Not every European BMW and Mercedes owner will look to us , but in this segment are a whole bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Susan Docherty , marketing director for GM Europe . " The one thing we 've got that no one else has is American cachet , " she says . " That 's why here ( at the Seville stand ) you 'll see American flags and images of New York and Washington . " <p> Indeed , with a jazz quartet jamming in one corner and ice cream being dished out in another , Cadillac is giving the 57th Frankfurt show a festive helping of Americana . <p> But the news truly worth celebrating is that U.S. automakers are starting to realize that flying Old Glory alone wo n't guarantee global sales .
