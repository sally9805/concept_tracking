Stolen water is sweet , and bread eaten in secret is pleasant . Proverbs 9:17 <p> Two weeks later , from the warm comfort of her claw-footed tub , Tana recalled exactly how she looked that day , stealing candles at the church . She had glanced at the slats of glass lining the lobby walls to see her reflected , stooped form leaning forward like a woman of 60 , not 35 . Her brown hair was unkempt , tied back , her oversized shirt and slacks too wrinkled and haphazard . She angled through the anteroom , slouching toward the murmur of the crowd as if it , like steam , could veil her . She straightened . Her eyes roamed casually to either side of the tiled path as she drifted forward , her neck stiff and unturning , her sights set on the tangled iron branches against the far wall . The stand bore dozens of virgin white , unlit stick candles , and with one smooth motion , Tana seized the tallest one , plucked it from its perch , and slipped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate surroundings-no one appeared to even notice her-and Tana moved on ; she would now find a good pew . She studied her own tan shoes as she circled through the 30 or more people-scattered threesomes , white-haired couples , mingling kindred-and finally , her loaded arm crooked stiffly at her side , she arrived at the vacant mid-point . The tenth planked row . She closed her eyes to the light filtering in through kaleidoscopes of glass , squeezed the candle , and felt the tingling buzz rush from forearm to center . " How much can the right word do ? " the priest asked ; Tana opened her eyes , a tall woman was now seated in front of her , nodding . The rosy back of the woman 's swept-up hair bobbed up and down , several wayward strands hooking away from the twist . " We Catholics are interested in discipline during the Lenten season , but is " no " the only word for us ? " Tana 's attention stayed with the woman 's dyed hair ; her dress was paisley and bloused and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side in time with the priest 's refrain . A sailor 's square of lace hung over the woman 's thin shoulders , and Tana peered over them to inventory her personal effects . A leather handbag , a pastry box , and-interesting-a fabriccovered notebook . Tana 's forearms tingled anew . From the back of the room , a baby cried out in shrieks . The cries pitched like heavy stones around the steep hollows of the church . Paisley craned her neck , straining to grin coyly in the direction of the child . What reflex , Tana thought . Outbursts , when they come from children , are smiled upon by religious people . The church fell silent for a moment , and Tana eyed the hymnal peeking out from the wooden rack by her knees . She swallowed . A man sitting next to Paisley-a perfectly straight back , Tana noted-turned to meet Paisley 's delicate eyes . With the locking of their gaze , the priest 's voice fell away and they both smiled . Not a shy smile , not a smile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked from them back to the notebook , and forced herself to remain still . January 27-I know what Ted says is true , that He hears us when we ask , and that what we ask Him for is ours , but I sometimes fear my questions betray me ( and Ted ) . Sometimes I know that if I open myself wide enough , or search within deep enough , I will learn Ted and I ask different things . Then I would be lost to this world forever . If I allowed that , if I allowed the loss , it would be the one thing I control. - Remember to meet Sally for lunch . Henna Rinse . Take paisley dress to cleaners . Resurface . Even if Saul had n't left her that previous Friday night , Tana might have ended up at church that day . Lately she had been curious about trinities . She imagined describing it to him , the incense , the Gothic dampness , the cult-like silence of families , and he would say something that would make them both feel better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , like any construct , can be crushed in a second , " he would say . " Better not to become dependent on one in this lifetime . Better to accept contingency for what it is-the only God . " Tana rolled her eyes , and her gaze landed back on the soft-bound notebook . She wanted it . January 31-Remember this : I am Mary yet I am distinct from Mary . Yes , I was named for Her ( for Him ) , but I mean at a deeper level , a more abstract level . I am not merely a vessel to be filled . . . with doctrine or with life . That is why , I am sure , this has happened . Nothing is concealed that will not be revealed , and nothing hidden that will not become known . Mysterious ways . Call the plumber . Talk about regrouting . Paisley shifted and the whole pew creaked with her . It registered with Tana , an ergonomics specialist , that pews have a well-meaning design , but ultimately the wrong makeup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wood , Tana knew , has no regard for the vulnerable lumbar region , one of the most frequently overlooked-abused , she thought , damagedareas of the human back . " So how much can the right word do ? " The priest 's bald forehead shone with new intensity , his gray eyebrows sharp and angular . " Only as much as we allow it by opening our hearts- " Tana extended her arm over her book bag and let the candle slide into it . The wax had heated up , and her sleeve felt vacant without it . She was thinking , can you fall in love with somebody because of the way they place your name in a sentence , the way they watch you while they smile , the way they turn to you and touch your arm after a moment of inattention ? " You know what , Tana , " she remembered Saul saying . " What ? " she asked . " I just saw something , watching you just now , " he reached over to touch her dark hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had been reading a trash novel , though wishing it were a classic , and he was smoking cigarettes in succession . " I just saw a vision of you as an old woman , " he said . Tana blinked hard , surprised by this revelation , daunted by its possibilities . She heard the whining rise and fall of laughter on the street below . " And ? " " And you 're going to be absolutely beautiful , Tana . Every creased line and softened part of you . " She smiled at these words now , but remembered feeling something fall inside at the thought of her body withering and folding in on itself . She had closed her eyes to a dreamy vision of a single rose ; it began , predictably , a strongstemmed vision of glory and then , as if it were glass , it cracked and shattered to empty space around it . For the next three days , to her horror , the sad cinema replayed itself , over and over , as if on fast forward , rewind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in plot , imagined the rose planted , attached to an entire bush as it would be outdoors , surrounded by loving thorns . Fortified . Then one day , the dream just vanished . The ragged wick of the candle peeked out of Tana 's old duffel , and a shot of exhilaration rocked her chest . Her seeking eyes set down back on the notebook , nestled on the pew between Straightback and Paisley . The exhilaration seeped away , absorbed into the spiraling patterns of the notebook 's padded fabric-its soft indigo background with white marbled clouding . The circus of it all spellbound her . February 5-I can see the design here . It is not time for me ; it is time for forbearance . We are luckier than some , we are more fortunate than those who reap unknowingly , without design . Good will come of this . A sound tree can not bear bad fruit any more than a decayed tree can bear good fruit . Ca n't he see that no fruit " is not bad fruit ? " Must he be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , Tana blocked his way by standing in her doorway , stretching out both arms and clenching the jambs . " I did n't mean what I said earlier , " she pleaded . He pushed past her-her nails ripping from wood-and told her apologies did n't matter now . The rims around his eyes were red and glossy . She had rattled him with her candor ; and now , he said , he had to go think . Find balance . He folded his coat over his arm and looked at her . He stood like that , still as wood , until she looked away , and then he left . The door slammed , unstilling the plastic model spine Tana used for demos . The third vertebra clattered on its vertical metal rod and Tana darted over to right it , crying . She had left things before-her parents , her hometown-so she knew when a goodbye was the real thing . Saul had been her only family for the ten years since college , since she wrote her own parents off as antiquated and irrelevant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush-stroked her into new worlds , new foundations . " I want to take up sculpting and model your body every single day , " he 'd say . " I do n't need food , I do n't need water . I want to live on you and your body alone . " He 'd laugh when he said these things , then he 'd make love to her , and then he 'd get up and leave . Tana would smile as he pulled on his jeans and T-shirtnever his shoes or socks-and watch after his barefooted exit . When it was safe , she 'd cry into the sock she had snatched with stealth from his clothes pile ; she 'd cry and blow her nose into it and then throw it against the wall . She decided it was love , and it was new enough to be true . Her parents loved , she thought , like two slats on a fence-parallel but not touching , utilitarian but unbending . She remembered so many moments from her study of them , so many clues that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsold Amway products home with him , and her mom would rush over , aproned and cooing , and marvel at the boxes , the detergents . No kisses , no endearments , but a close look at the spray starch , and in return her dad would sniff at the air a couple times and smile . Dinner smells great , he never said , thanks for cooking . " You 'll learn , Tana , " her mother told her confidentially , " you 'll learn that men need importance and strength . But first they need us to believe it in them . Then they can believe it in themselves . " Tana nodded and grinned , and slipped the spray starch up her skirt . Saul and Tana did n't sleep together right away . It was part of how they were together-always testing themselves , striving for wayward goals . " Let 's not eat for a week , " he said to her once , his dark brittle hair tied back to reveal his side-burned face . In him , Tana saw graceful frivolity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than his irreverence , his quick wit , his daring rebelliousness , she coveted his unspoiled regard for her : he was someone unacquainted with who she was before . Someone who had not walked her high school halls to see her , skirted and dumb , clawing for locker doors , drinking fountains , exits signs , anything to lend her purpose or let her out . Someone who did not know it was she that took her sixth grade teacher 's copy of The Bastard , causing the whole class to sit through recess in a waiting game that yielded no confessions . He was a person to take her as she wanted to be , any figment accepted . " Then we 'll go to Pizza Joe 's and order three larges just for us . " As always , she persevered , collapsing on the last day with a euphoric thud . He had stopped fasting , he later told her , laughing , on the second day . The first time they had sex , Saul stopped in the middle and asked if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said of course he could . She said , You can , but what about me ? Should I look back ? He nodded and clenched his teeth . He already believed in himself and his art , and he had enough left over to believe in her . She felt it in the way he watched her . Later that night , after he had gone-without his T-shirt , which Tana clutched between her breasts-she called her mother and told her she was wrong . She told her it did n't all have to be about him , it could be about both . Her mother was silent and then she said , " I 'm glad you 've figured everything out , " and put her father on the phone . He mumbled some words about the wind chill , the deer he killed- " the cleanest shot yet . " Tana hung up and knew she had a new family now . Saul was that to her now . His otherworld , his otherway , was a heritage she wanted planted into her , its roots piercing through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The priest said , " We mourn , we abstain , we meditate , so we can know how to best love . " She thought of what she would write in the notebook , her body tensing suddenly as if she would spring uncontrollably for it . She calmed . " So often love latches on-an intoxicating weekend of bliss-only to lose hold and fall away with Monday 's sober yank , " she would write . " Saturday 's muse , Sunday 's burnisher of dead passion , scratches awake on Monday with a belch and a remote groan . " Tana wondered how much of the notebook was full , and visualized margin to margin of clean , empty space . The truth of it , the likelihood that it would be full , did not occur to her until later . Things were empty to her now . But only now . February 18-What do you call one who shines ? I must commission one for my soul , it is quite dull lately . Ted 's become an iceman . He obsesses about everything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the turkey basters and the impossibility of things . I tried to bring up the agency people , the waiting list , but he could n't stop talking about the chipmunks stealing food from the birdfeeder . Why ? My nephew ran in and said , " You 're the one afraid of being stolen from . " What is hidden from the learned has been revealed to the children . " Love feeds on water , " Saul had once told Tana , his mock British accent overdrawn , his clefted chin deepened . " And the first lesson in liquids:fluidity . " After a monotony of laughter at his pretension , the nugget of truth caught in Tana 's throat . In order to remain in love , they would need to be apart , spread themselves into distinct spaces . She knew this was his belief , and his beliefs had become theirs . Still , when they graduated from Ann Arbor , they ended up in Boston together-in separate apartments yet still joined . Tana felt the familial pull toward him , a need , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't we just try , Saul ? Why do n't we move in together for a trial ? " But Tana had promised , he reminded her , that it was okay with her to be this way forever . What happened to marriage being complacent ? he asked , What happened to wanting two wholes , not two half selves ? She had promised , yes , and then she had truly believed it . But now she knew her careerdesigner chairs and model spines-did not fill her up , nor did fragments of Saul . She began to worry about her own bones , what had calcified there without her knowledge . The church quieted again ; a moment of silence for Father Michaud , who had , sadly , passed on . Tana was inching closer to Paisley 's sublime book , the wood giving slightly as she slid , tedious , down the plank . The Paisley woman appeared distracted , deep in prayer ; the man 's head tilted away , and Tana kneeled forward onto the cushioned shelf before her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was wrong-taking things . In fact , she felt it was rather cliche of her . But the impulse itself was more powerful than her indictment of it , so to mollify herself , she vowed never to let things go to waste . Certainly , she reasoned , she would fill each page of this wondrous book . March 17-Ted directed me to the Barren Fig Tree in Luke 13 . It seemed so cruel to me , he had it laying out by the coffee pot with a note . Later I asked him , " What are you saying ? Are you likening me to the vine that bore no fruit ? Are you saying I clutter up the ground ? " and he said " No , it 's the reading for next week , the third reading for the third Sunday of the Lenten Season . " He 's never prepared me , as it were , for readings before . The vinedresser , responding to the man who had come for three years looking for fruit , said " Sir , leave it another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then perhaps it will bear fruit . If not , it shall be cut down . " Music thundered through the church , and Tana was gripped by a sense that she should stand . Her legs ached from walking the city so much ; what could she do on a Sunday morning but walk the city ? She hated that her place had become the place-the place that singles who are lovers always make . The street she lived on was hilly , and every day she huffed its slope , asking questions to herself . What sense is trudging up hills when your destination is an empty room-or an empty room filled with Saul ? Why get there at all ? Why struggle ? She would arrive out of breath and Saul would be waiting and she 'd ask him these questions . He 'd fumble through words and cigarettes , never getting to a still enough place for answers . He 'd smoke three to the butt and tell a joke before asking for sex , which he felt was answer enough . For years , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Tana joined them . The priest said , " Our luck will shine through in how we best love , " and the Straightbacked man reached over to take Paisley 's flat hand . Tana gasped , thrown by the display of what she had convinced herself , in hindsight , was not tenderness . From their profiles Tana saw the white teeth and peaceful eyes of them , and another round of baby shrieks filled the room . Tana could guess what that sound meant to them ; their dialogue was not as silent as they thought . She had a whole pew to herself , and that fact began hammering at her temples . The book would be more than full when she got her hands on it . March 30-He was crying in the dark when I got home yesterday . I turned on the light and he had Matthew opened on his lap . He read to me about the disciples who could not cure the demented boy . The boy 's father turned to Jesus , desperate , and Jesus cured the boy instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . If they had faith the size of a mustard seed they would be able to say to a mountain " Move from here to there , " and it would move . Nothing would be impossible for them then . I turned out the light and left him to cry more . I am shamed that I thought as I walked away : I might move mountains without him . Remember-Pick up paisley dress for Sunday . Here 's what made Saul leave : that night , while he made love to Tana , she told him exactly what she was thinking . She said , I love you and hate you and do n't know you , all at one time . It 's like a trinity of truths . The pew creaked again , the book beamed . That 's all she said aloud , but in her head the sentences flowed in cruel rants . I hate you for what you 're doing to me , for the fact that you can grind into me like I 'm clay , and disregard that it 's me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinked deliberately , staring at Paisley 's hand . Straightback squeezed it , and let go. -I love you for allowing yourself pleasure in front of me ; you groan and you strain above me like someone without secrets . You show me that weakness in you. - The baby cries , louder. - But I do n't know you . Who is this man straining above me , arching his back and frowning and asking me to lie still ? He strains and he looks down at me , cupping my entire head in the crook of his arm and says , What are you thinking , and then he grinds and he makes faces and has sex . Paisley creaked forward to replace a hymnal , and Tana settled back into the present of things . The priest 's passion was building . " The Lord God is my help , " he read . " I have set my face like flint , knowing that I shall not be put to shame ! " Tana began to feel dizzy . " I tell you , from now on I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coming of the reign of God ! " The priest 's small face brightened to pink . It was then that she had stared at him , watching him stare back and rock against her , watching him find a spot on the ceiling and forget her altogether . It was then she so hated him . What are you thinking , he had asked her , and she had told him . And he left . Tana choked back a sob and surprised herself , feeling the stares at her back , feeling the red gaze from all directions-the walls , the floor , all so closed-and wanting to scream through the damn glass that made everything so red ! People were standing up . Had she done it ? Had she screamed ? Was it over ? No . They stood up in rows and marched down the center aisle to receive Communion . Tana breathed deeply-thank God ! - then hesitated for a moment . Should she follow ? She was , after all , not Catholic . It was against some high order , she suspected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Straightback stood to join the procession ; they walked completely free of one another , almost like strangers . The woman with the screaming baby passed her pew . She was small and took tiny steps . Tana imagined how she must look to the woman , how she must appear so damned and so alone . Her hair-she reached up to touch it at her neck-had she even remembered to brush it ? It felt flat and pulled-back and she knew it was okay . She inhaled and the notebook 's sharp corner dug into her ribs ; the Paisley woman returned to her seat , looking satisfied , full , and alive . Tana held the notebook above water level in her tub , bathing with the pages as if to absorb their words . She turned to the last filled page and read : It says in the Old Testament to be fertile , then , and multiply ; to abound on earth and subdue it , but I have no desire for that . I have hopes for harmony . I need to live in equality with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet trust enough of anyone or anything to hand them over my destiny . Including Ted . Including my Church . Including myself . I will control this . I will refresh . Tana plucked the stopper out of the drain . She turned to the next page , completely empty , and started ordering the words in her mind .
