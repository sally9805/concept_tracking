For standard bearers of the computer revolution , the techies who run America Online have a pretty shaky grasp of basic math . Let 's see : you 're the most successful online service in Internet history , with membership rolls shooting up in only three years from 500,000 to 7 million . You 're about to launch a snazzy TV ad campaign built around a radical change in pricing policy : from stiff , pay-by-the-hour bills to unlimited all-you-can-eat access to the Internet for $19.95 a month . Yet you have added only a modest number of modems to the 200,000 you already need to service your teeming masses . On Dec. 1 , you flick the switch on the new era . <P> The result ? Half a million new subscribers in four weeks , twice the usage from your existing customers and countless unhappy people , such as Bill Blevins , a Springfield , Missouri , police dispatcher and AOL subscriber who spent four hours and hundreds of busy signals one afternoon last week before managing to log on . " It 's got progressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're advertising something they ca n't provide . " <P> Not anymore . Last week , after a multimedia convergence of bad publicity , customer complaints and threats of legal action from three dozen state attorneys general , America Online , the world 's largest Internet and online-service provider , agreed to cancel its cool , Jetsons-themed television pitches for new subscribers while it augments its network to accommodate the 8 million members it already has . AOL is committed to spending $350 million over the next few months to add 150,000 modems . As part of the deal made with the attorneys general , the company also agreed to offer rebates of up to $39.90 for users who could n't get what they were paying for . <P> And would n't you know it ? AOL 's phone lines were swamped once again , this time by users requesting refunds . Many of them were angry at being kept on hold for long periods , but state regulators pronounced themselves satisfied . Most analysts also seemed unconcerned . Said Lehman Brothers analyst Brian Oakes : " I think we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signals and the refund calls . There 's always an initial wave . " <P> Bob Pittman , president and CEO of AOL Networks , was quick to declare victory . " We did the right thing for the customer , " he said . " We are not about computers and wires ; we 're about a relationship with our members . " <P> Funny , that relationship almost came undone by a lack of computers and wires . For years the company flourished despite monthly fees of $9.95 for five hours online , plus $2.95 for each additional hour , which kept AOL 's subscribers watching the clock . But the growing challenge from Internet- service providers like Netcom , AT &T; and even Microsoft Network finally prompted AOL to lower its monthly fee to match the going rate of $19.95 for unlimited Internet access . For that amount , users would get not only the Internet but also AOL 's own proprietary content , including games , scores of newspaper and magazine sites and special features like the popular Motley Fool investment forum .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
