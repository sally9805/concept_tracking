It eats pesky insects from the ground and bushes // Dr. Merlin Tuttle has been charged by elephants and stalked by tigers . He has climbed into caves with cobras . But his real life calling is studying and photographing bats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into studying small mammals , including bats , " Tuttle said . At 15 , Tuttle started making scientific observations about bat behavior . By the time he was a senior in high school , he had obtained plastic bat bands from the Smithsonian Institution . That led to banding and tracking 40,000 gray bats over the course of 20 years of research in the wild . Banding involves placing a small band around the ankle of a bat to identify the animal . The bands are used to track whole colonies of bats , and determine the caves in which they roost . Bats Help the Environment " Bats are extraordinarily important mammals , but they rank among the least known , " Tuttle said . " Usually , the most you learn about them in school is that they are the only group of flying mammals . But there are nearly 1,000 species of bats , and they amount to about one-fourth of all mammal species found on earth . They have important ecological roles . " Worldwide , bats are the main predators of vast numbers of insects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollinate plants and disperse seeds , which is crucial to the continued growth of the rain forests . Tuttle says just attracting bats to a bat house in your yard can scare away a lot of insect pests . " For instance in just one summer , a colony of 150 big brown bats can eat 18 million root worms , which turn into cucumber beetles , " explained Tuttle . " That one pest costs American farmers $1 billion per year in crop damage . " Love Bats ? Leave Them Alone ! One of Tuttle 's main goals is to dispel the age-old image of bats as dangerous , frightening animals . " Children should be cautioned never to handle wild animals , particularly bats , because they are small and look unthreatening , " he warned . " But to give you some idea how rare bat rabies is , Texas has the largest bat population of any state , and there have been only two cases in all of history of humans contracting bat rabies in Texas . One of those happened when a guy who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit him . Imagine that ! " Look at the odds of contracting bat rabies , Tuttle says . " Do you shiver in terror each time you walk upstairs ? Two thousand people fall down stairs and die each year . When you go swimming , are you afraid of drowning ? Six thousand people drown each year . Basically , your odds of getting hit by a falling coconut are higher than being harmed by bats . " In the last 15 years , 13 people have died of bat rabies in the United States and Canada combined . Yet human fear has resulted in the mass extermination of many kinds of bats , and there is still widespread ignorance about their importance to the environment . The result ? Bats are among the most endangered land mammals in the United States , Tuttle says . . Alarmed at the dramatic decline in bats worldwide , Tuttle founded Alarmed at the dramatic International in bats worldwide , Tuttle found took up proBat Conservation International photography as ways to help others understand , Tex. , in 1982 and took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others understand to write a book chapter on bats , all the National Geographic Society as he found showed him them write a book chapter on bats , all the bat photographs he found showed them snarling I in self defense " because the photographer was bothering them . One look at Tuttle 's photographs is all it takes to convince most folks that bats have " as many comical expressions as many other mammals . " Tuttle 's bats look directly at the camera , their ears cocked quizzically , their features alert and without fear . How does he take such intimate photos of these shy , funny-looking creatures ? " Only someone who understands bats and appreciates animals in general would be able to get those pictures , " Tuttle says proudly " You ca n't easily photograph a bat in the wild . And once a bat is caught , it expects to be killed or eaten so it tends to show bared teeth . My success is largely due to the fact that I understand more than most about bat behavior . " Tuttle Tames the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do his bat portraits . He captures a bat and tames it . Within an hour or two , Tuttle can get a bat to land on his hand on command . " I do my work near the cave where I catch the bats . It 's much easier if the bats do n't fear you . Afterward , I let them go . " For his first of four articles in National Geographic , he trained frogeating bats to catch frogs on command , to catch only the frog he point ed to , and to do right or left turns on approach so Tuttle could get different framings . But Tuttle does n't take unnecessary chances . " All of us who handle mammals in the wild pre-vaccinate against rabies , " he said . Tuttle has found himself in only one dangerous situation with bats . In 1983 , he was working in a cave with tens of millions of bats . The ammonia fumes inside the cave-created by insects that feed on bat droppings-were overwhelming . " I was working alone , and the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was wearing to breathe was leaking . I barely made it out . The air in there nearly destroyed my lungs . " Bats Help Other Bats in Need " Bats are neat , gentle animals , " says Tuttle . " They are also very smart and compassionate . Bats will adopt orphans and they also will help other individuals in need to the point of risking their own lives . " He recalls a case where a leading researcher working at New Mexico 's Carlsbad Caverns placed three bats in an open can . One bat figured out he could get free and flew out , but when he heard his two friends crying , he circled around and climbed back into the can with them . Biologists who have trapped baby bats at night have been startled when the mother bats flew down and landed right on their arms , trying to get their babies back . Kid Power Save the Bats What can the average kid do to help bats ? Boy Scout Burt Grantges got interested in bats and eventually borrowed some slide programs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his school , then at other schools , then at adult organizations like Rotary and Audubon , " Tuttle said . " By the time he was 13 , Burt had been on Johnny Carson 's show and had lectured to as many as 1,200 people a night on bats . It gives you some idea what one child can do . " Tuttle does n't underestimate kids . " You 're never too young to get serious about your future , " he says . " I ca n't tell you how many Ph.D . professors and scientists helped me very generously in my early learning . " Tuttle says he is one of many scientists who are very interested in helping kids who are serious about their professions . " Virtually all of us love to have a kid work with us who is serious , " he said . " Most of us , if we see someone who is dedicated to learning , we 'll help them ourselves or find someone who will .
