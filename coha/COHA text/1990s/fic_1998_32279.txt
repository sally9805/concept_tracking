ONE A Line in the Sand JUDD Thompson and the other three kids living in his otherwise abandoned suburban house sometimes felt as if it was just them against the world . Judd , at sixteen , was the oldest . Then came the redhead , Vicki Byrne , a year younger . Lionel Washington was thirteen , and Ryan Daley , twelve . They were the only ones left from their families . Judd 's parents and his twin younger brother and sister had disappeared right out of their clothes a few days before . Vicki Byrne , who had lived in a trailer park with her parents and little sister , had seen the same thing happen at her place . Her older brother , who had moved to Michigan , had disappeared too , according to one of his friends . Lionel Washington had lost his parents , his older sister , and his little brother and sister . His uncle , the infamous Andr Dupree , was thought dead , but Lionel now knew he was alive somewherebut where ? Ryan Daley had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His parents had not disappeared . They had died in separate accidents related to the worldwide vanishings of millions of peoplehis father in a plane crash , his mother in an explosion while in her car . The kids knew what had happened . At least the three older ones did . Ryan was n't sure yet . All he knew was that he had been left alone in the world , and he did n't much like the explanation the other three had come to believe . All three of the older kids had had parents who were Christians . They believed not only in God , but also in Christ . And they were n't just churchgoers . These were people who had believed that the way to God , the way to heaven , was through Christ . In other words , they did not agree with so many people who believed that if you just tried to live right and be good and treat other people fairly , you could earn your way to heaven and to favor with God . As logical as all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lionel believed that the real truth , the basic teaching of the New Testament , was summarized in two verses in the book of Ephesians . Chapter 2 , verses 8-9 said that a person is saved by grace through faith and that it is not as a result of anything we accomplished . It is the gift of God , not a result of good deeds , so nobody can brag about it . They also believed that one day , as the Bible also foretold , Jesus would return and snatch true believers away in the twinkling of an eye , and they would immediately join him in heaven . That was what had happened , Judd , Vicki , and Lionel realized , since most of the people in their churches had disappeared too . But what convinced them more than anything was that they themselves were still here . Judd had never received Christ , though he had grown up in church and knew the Bible . Vicki had hated it when her parents had become Christians two years before , and she did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother and younger sister had also believed . She had seen the changes in her family and realized there was some truth to what was going on . She had an idea they were onto something real , but she was n't willing to give up her lifestyle or her freedom to join them in their faith . Lionel had been more like Judd , having been raised by a Christian family and having gone to church every Sunday for years . He had not become a rebel as Judd did when he became a teenager . Rather , he had pretended all along to be a Christian . It was his and his uncle Andr 's secret . They were not really Christians . Those oldest three kids realized their tragic mistake immediately when the vanishings had taken place . In the midst of chaos , as cars crashed , planes fell from the sky , ships collided and sank , houses burned , and people panicked , they had to admit they had been wrongas wrong as people could be . They were glad to find out there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Christ . But though that gave them the assurance that they would one day see God and be reunited with their families , it did n't keep them from grieving over the loss of their loved ones . They were alone in the world until they had discovered each other and Bruce Barnes , the visitation pastor at New Hope Village Church who had agreed to help teach them the Bible . He had given them each a Bible and invited them to the first Sunday service following the disappearances , which the Bible called the Rapture . But Ryan Daley was still a holdout . He was scared . He was sad . He was angry . And while he had been hanging with Lionel since they had met , Lionel made him feel like a wimp . Well , he did n't just feel like one . He was one . Lionel seemed brave . He confronted his uncle 's enemies , he had been to the morgue to try to identify his uncle 's body , and he had gone into Ryan 's house after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that stuff , and it made him feel terrible . Judd had invited everybody to live at his place . Vicki did n't have any choice after her trailer had burned to the ground . Some of Lionel 's uncle Andr 's " associates " had virtually taken over Lionel 's place , so he needed somewhere to crash too . Ryan could have stayed at his own house and Lionel would have stayed there with him , but Ryan could n't make himself go inside . There were too many scary memories . It had been just him and his parents in that house , and now they were dead . And then there had been the burglary , so he was n't about to set foot in the place . Lionel could make fun of him all he wanted , but Ryan was glad to take Judd up on his offer . Judd 's family had clearly been the wealthiest of the four . His house was a huge mansion . Well , almost a mansion . There were bigger and nicer homes around , but not many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own bedroom and lots of privacy . No one knew what the future held , at least among the kids . Bruce Barnes sure seemed to know . He had made it his business to become a student of Bible prophecy and must have been spending almost every spare minute buried in the Bible and reference books . He told the kids that it was time to be on the lookout for a man the Bible called the Antichrist . " He will come offering peace and harmony , and many people will be fooled , thinking he 's a good man with their best interests at heart . He will make some sort of an agreement with the nation of Israel , but it will be a lie . The signing of that agreement will signal the beginning of the last seven years of tribulation before Christ returns again to set up his thousand-year kingdom on earth . " Bruce explained the Tribulation as a period of suffering for all the people of the world , more suffering even than they had endured when millions of people had disappeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids all of the judgments that would come from heaven during those seven years , some twenty-one of them in three series of seven . Judd had called the kids together one evening after they had all received their Bibles from Bruce . " I 'm not trying to be the boss or anything , " he began , " but I am the oldest and this is my house , and so there are going to be some rules . To stay in this house , we all have to agree to watch out for each other . Let each other know where you are all the time so we do n't worry about you . Do n't do anything stupid like getting in trouble , breaking the law , staying out all night , that kind of stuff . And I think we all ought to be reading what Bruce tells us to read every day and also going to whatever meetings he invites us to , besides church of course . I mean , we 're going to church every Sunday to keep up with what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , " Vicki said . " Sounds fair . " " Not to me , " Ryan said . " I 'm not into this stuff , and you all know it . " " Guess you 're going to have to live somewhere else then , " Lionel said . " That 's not for you to say , Lionel ! " Ryan said . " This is n't your house ! Judd 's not going to make me read the Bible and go to church meetings just to stay here . Are you , Judd ? " " Matter of fact , I am , " Judd said . " What ? " " I can hardly believe I 'm saying this , " Judd said , " because just last week it made me so mad when my parents said the same thing . But here goes . As long as you live under my roof , you follow my rules . " Ryan 's face was red , and it appeared he might bolt out of there like he often did when he heard something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force you to become a Christian , " Judd said . " Nobody can do that . Even Vicki and I needed to decide that in our own time on our own terms . But I 'm taking you in , man . You 're staying here because I asked you to . The least you can do is to join in with what the rest of us are doing . It 's all for one and one for all . We 're going to look out for you and protect you and take care of you , even if you do n't believe like we do , and we 're going to expect you to do the same for us . I ca n't even make you read the Bible , but we 're going to go to church and to Bruce 's special little meetings , and we 're going together . You can plug your ears or sleep through them , but you 're going . " " And if I do n't ? " " Then you can find someplace else to stay . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's too much of a scaredy-cat . " " Shut up ! " Ryan said . " Lay off him , Lionel , " Vicki said . " You 're not going to win him over that way . " " You 're not going to win me over at all , " Ryan said . " Just watch . " " Well , " Judd said , " what 's the deal . You in or out ? " " I have to decide right now ? " " We have a meeting with Bruce tonight and church tomorrow morning . You go with us tonight and you promise to go tomorrow , or you move out this afternoon . " " The man 's drawing a line in the sand for you , " Lionel said . " Lionel ! " Vicki scolded . " I 'm just sayin ' , the line has been drawn . You crossing the line , Ryan ? Or are you with us ? " " I 'll think about it , " Ryan said , and he was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been assigned . " We need to pray for him , " Vicki said . " It 's hard enough for us , but imagine what it 's like for him . We know where our parents are . If he believes like we do that our parents were raptured and his were n't , he has to accept that his parents are in hell . Think about that . He 's going to fight this a long time , because even if he wants to become a believer , that means he 's accepting that his parents are lost forever . " " It sure would be nice if we could somehow find out his parents , or at least one of them , was actually a Christian or became one before they died , " Lionel said . " Get real , " Judd said . " That rarely happens in real life . " " I know . " Lionel was dealing with his own dilemma . His uncle had left a long message on Lionel 's answering machine , going on and on about killing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be a Christian . He was clearly drunk or high or both , and Lionel had been convinced that Andr had killed himself . When Lionel and Ryan had ridden their bikes all the way to Andr 's neighborhood one night to investigate , the cops had told them Andr 's body was at a nearby morgue . It had indeed been a suicide , they told Lionel . Because Andr had had enemies to whom he owed money , and those guys had moved into Lionel 's house and kicked him out , Lionel figured they had murdered Andr and made it look like suicide . But when Judd had driven Lionel to the morgue a few days later so Lionel could identify the body , he had run into a shocker . While the victim was the same height and weight as Andr , and while he had carried Andr 's wallet and wore Andr 's clothes and jewelry , the body was clearly not Andr 's . Finding the truth about that mystery would be Lionel 's mission over the next several days . Meanwhile , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about what life was supposed to be like , now that Christ had raptured his church . Judd agreed that they should pray for Ryan , and that in fact they should pray at the end of all their little house meetings , the way Bruce had them pray at the end of their meetings at church . But first he asked , " Is there anything else either of you needs to talk about now ? " " Yeah , " Lionel said . " I just want to say that I 'm not really trying to put down Ryan . I 'm trying to toughen him up the way I did my little brother and sister and the way my sister did me . I do n't want to make him mad or feel bad , but he 's such a wuss . It 's time for that boy to grow up . " " It 's hard to grow up this way , " Vicki said . " I do n't know about you guys , but I 'm having trouble . I have bad dreams , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they 're all just dead and gone and not in heaven where I know I 'll see them someday . I know we 're all going to be called back to school one of these days , and I ca n't imagine sitting through class with all I know now . If this Antichrist guy shows up soon and does sign some sort of a contract with Israel , we 're gon na have only seven more years to live . " Judd and Lionel sat nodding . " Anyway , " Judd said , " Lionel , you do have to try to encourage Ryan . If he decides against becoming a Christian , I sure would n't want to have it on my conscience that I pushed him away . As much as you guys squabble , I still think he looks up to you . " " Really ? " " Oh , yeah , " Vicki said . " I think that 's obvious . He wants your approval . " " Wow . " " You might want to encourage him . " " Hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it right now . " Lionel hurried to Ryan 's room , trying to decide what to say . When he peeked in and knocked , Ryan whirled from what he was doing . " Hey , little man , " Lionel said . " I thought I asked you to quit calling me that , " Ryan said . " Yeah , sorry . Listen , I just want to say that I 'm sorry about getting on your case all the time . " Ryan did n't respond . Lionel tried again . " I mean , uh , I 'm just saying " Ryan approached the door , where Lionel stood , tongue-tied . " You 're just saying you do n't know what you 're saying , right ? " Lionel did not respond . " Are you finished ? " Ryan asked , his hand on the door . " No , I " " Yes , you are , " Ryan said . And he pushed the door shut in Lionel 's face . Lionel returned to Judd and Vicki , clearly troubled . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pray for that boy , " Vicki said . But before they did , Lionel said , " You need to know he was packing up . " " Really ? " Judd said . " He 's leaving ? " " I do n't know , " Lionel said , " but he was getting all his stuff together . " And they prayed for him .
