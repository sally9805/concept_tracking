Was this your first , uh , infidelity , Mrs. Kennedy ? " asked the somewhat prissy , prurient marriage counselor , to whom Arabel and Bertram Kennedy had gone after her teary confession that she loved another man-a very young man , Richard , not only unemployed in a gainful way but a poet , whom she meant to marry . <p> A pause , while both the counselor , who was small , and large tall Dr. Kennedy , a college dean , waited for Arabel to say yes , and perhaps to cry a little more . <p> But instead her head went up like a horse 's , scenting something special in the wind . " Well , no , " she said . " As a matter of factquite a few , " and she went on to specify . <p> Or , so I imagine the scene . But Arabel has recounted it almost exactly in that way both to me alone , when we were first becoming friends , and later once or twice to a group . I think she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own moment , of confounding expectations . <p> " There was Bob , and then George . You remember Kenneth ? " she said to Bertram , who paled , as the counselor 's breath quickened . And Arabel went on , and on . <p> By the time I met Arabel , at Lathrop College , in Marin County , California , she had probably been through-fucked , screwed , or simply had ( that last would have been her own word , I think ) she had had sex with most of the male faculty , especially in the English department , the department that this particularly selfconscious , upscale party was meant to welcome and to introduce to each other . In which my own husband , Kevin , was to teach . Meeting Arabel , there was no evidence of such adventures ; I only thought and later said to Kevin that she did not look like the wife of a dean . <p> Arabel was tall and rangy , with striking gray-white hair that looked premature . Smooth , tan skin and big , clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; when I learned that , she began to make more sense to me . To an Easterner , especially from New England , Montana was far more exotic than California was . Arabel dressed violently , her style was carelessly dramatic : big sweeping skirts and randomly bright scarves , over well-worn cotton T-shirts , a shade too small . Everything could have been pulled at the last minute from a tangled closet floor . ( " Is that what you 're going to wear ? " I could imagine Bertram , the dean , asking this . " Sure is ! " Breezy Arabel , barely looking at him . ) <p> This party , given by the president of Lathrop , was at his house , a glass-and-steel structure on a steep hillside in western Marin , near the coast . The view was ravishing ; now in September , lovely spreading live oaks cast their wide lacy shadows on yellowed grassy slopes that here and there were creased with dark ravines . And in the distance , the shining flat Pacific , stretching out to a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have beautified the room , but it did not . The room simply failed to live up to that view . High and narrow , crowded by impossibly tall bookcases , that space turned a party into a traffic jam . It was rather like being in a drugstore , a postmodern show-off drugstore , with a giant Kodachrome " view " on one wall . <p> Kevin and I had come out to California from New York and New England , respectively . And I think New England may explain the extremity of some of my reactions . In my old schools and colleges , the wives of deans wore proper suits and pearls . As I should have said , all this took place in the seventies , when many people longed for a return to the conformity of the fifties . Recovery from the sixties had been hard ; it was felt to be generally incomplete . Kevin the New Yorker was less judgmental than I ; also he was busier , he had his job . I had planned to work in San Francisco , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an essentially non-publishing city there was very little work for a book designer . I would find something , I knew , but it would take a while . <p> That afternoon , along with the Kennedys , we met the local English department and their husbands and wives ( quite a few of Arabel 's former lovers , it later turned out ) . No one , I thought , was especially memorable-except Arabel . The food was interesting , though , to me : a lot of goat cheese and mussels and crab , in what were then innovative combinations . <p> At some point I asked someone for directions to the bathroom , and then made my way down several high , narrow passages . Arrived at a closed door , I knocked . <p> " Come on in , " urged a friendly voice . " I 'm just finishing off my nose . <p> Arabel . <p> " Oh , it 's you . Great . " But she added , " I was afraid it might be Bert , pestering me to come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties . " And then , " Go on and pee , and then we can talk . " <p> Then , as I was washing my hands and she was still brushing that beautiful unruly hair , she said , " Lord , these parties almost stifle me to death . You 'd think I could manage by now . Well , I guess I do manage , in my way . " She looked over at me and gave a sudden , complicitous , small laugh , with a matching grin . <p> " I guess this is my first one , " I told her . <p> " I thought . Well , you 'll either get used to them or you wo n't . " <p> " Do I have a choice ? " <p> A long look which I felt to be of appraisal , and then she said , " Well , that depends . " <p> Kevin had been my English professor at the University of Northern Iowa , in Cedar Falls , whence I had gone to escape the Vassar fate of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there because , despite a Harvard Ph.D. , it was the only job around . We were excited about Northern California , so much change , along with his divorce and our instant subsequent marriage . California seemed a marvelous achievement , both exciting and propitious . And Kevin to me seemed endlessly exciting , with his curly gray hair and serious blue eyes . " A typical Irish , " my Boston mother had said , thus ensuring my marriage . We felt that our passion and our daring , our love , were both brave and unique-as almost everyone does , at some time or another , I guess . <p> But after that first department party , when I said to Kevin that Arabel did not look like a dean 's wife , his response was disappointing . " Looks like a typical aging hippie to me , " he said . " I guess some of them did marry deans . " <p> " I thought she had a lot of style . " <p> " Oh , Kate , come on to bed . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went off to bed with Kevin . <p> Our romance , Kevin 's and mine , had mostly taken place in a Holiday Inn just outside of Cedar Falls . I would go and take a room and wait for Kevin , who lurked in his car , in the adjacent parking lot . And those tacky rooms with their ghastly paintings seemed progress indeed from Kevin 's messy office , the paperstrewn desk on which we had first made love . <p> All of which is by way of saying that when Arabel first began to hint to me that she had put in some time in motels , of an afternoon , I knew what she meant-although I also experienced some lessening of my own sense of high and original adventure . <p> And unrelatedly , perhaps , I began less and less to like the small house that Kevin and I had rented on the edge of some woods . It was just too small , a motel of a house , one story , stucco , with its kitchen-dining " area , " its diminutive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms there were large picture windows that showed the enormous grove of redwoods and eucalyptus that dwarfed the house-and dwarfed , too , our sense of ourselves , of our own importance in California , to California . <p> Everything had looked better on paper , especially the house : such a bargain , so near the campus . And Kevin 's salary had looked better before deductions and alimony shriveled it to a barely living wage . For every reason it began to seem essential that I get a job . Bookstore work would have been ideal , I thought , though I knew that probably dozens of people at that time had the same idea . Aware of the sheer unlikeliness of getting what I wanted ( though , after all , I had got Kevin ) , I nevertheless began to comb Marin County . <p> And one afternoon , in a parking lot in Corte Madera , I ran into Arabel . <p> " You ca n't have been where I just was , can you , " was her greeting , not really a question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I told her . " I 'm out jobhunting . It 's pretty discouraging : " <p> She looked in the direction I 'd pointed , and then at me ( an appraisal ) . " Oh , Sandy 's store . He 'll hire you , I 'd bet on it . He 's very horny , and he loves little blondes with big tits . ' <p> Too embarrassed for any response , I certainly did not ask what she was doing there . <p> But she told me , ten minutes later , over the coffee that she insisted we have , in a handy non-Sanborn coffeehouse . <p> " The most terrible thing , " she began , and her blue eyes pooled with tears as she spoke ( but of course I did n't know her at all ; maybe she cried a lot ? ) . She went on , " It must mean something , your being here just at this moment . And you look like a person to trust , " she said , carefully scanning my face . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't , not at all . I 've fallen really in love , I mean for real . For good . I really think that , and he 's only thirty And a poet ; that 's the supposedly funny part , but it is n't . The really funny part is that he 's crazy about me , too-at my age ! I think I 'll have to tell Bert . God , if he does n't kill me- " <p> I had no idea what to say to all this . None . <p> Arabel continued , though with less intensity , more in the tone of someone musing to herself . " God , after all the guys I 've had , and known not to take seriously . God , I hate to think how many motel afternoons . Years of those . " She laughed briefly . " Well , it 's the only way I 've found to get through the days around here . Does hoist on your own petard ' apply , do you think ? " <p> Because she was calmer now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the start : " Bert does n't know any of this ? " <p> " God no . Though sometimes I 've wondered how he could not know . And there have been a few near misses . " She raised her chin , and focused her eyes on some distant prospect . " But this time I 'll have to tell him . " <p> " You were n't in love before ? " I asked . A bold and sentimental question , but Arabel had a sort of anything-goes style that permitted-anything . <p> She laughed . " Of course not . Well , maybe the first time out , a little in love , or at least pretending to be . Pro forma , so to speak . But the ones after that , I was just amusing myself . A fun way to kill time , kill boredom , as I saw it . But with Richard , this is a whole new ballgame . " " Oh . " <p> " Really . I think I want us to get married . " She sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to tell Bert tonight . " <p> Which is what she did , I guess . The next story I heard , over more coffee in the same Corte Madera coffee place , was that of the marriage counselor who had managed to make things much worse with his question . " Tell me , Mrs. Kennedy , was this your first infidelity ? " <p> " Well , no . As a matter of fact- " And so on . Arabel 's list . <p> Arabel was right about the bookstore . I had been hired by Sandy , and if he was horny , he was restrained and polite about it . ( " So far , " said Arabel , with her smile , when I interrupted her story to make this observation . ) <p> And the fact that the bookstore was almost adjacent to the motel most favored by Arabel and Richard was certainly a factor in our developing friendship , Arabel 's and mine . <p> " What will be interesting will be this Richard 's reaction , " said Kevin , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He may be a little less than totally delighted . " <p> " On the other hand , suppose he is ? " I argued . " He could be mad for her , too , she 's really attractive . Even if you do n't see it . " <p> " But twenty years older ? He may not be dying to support an older wife : ' <p> " Kevin , he may not have to . Maybe Arabel will get a job and support him . She thinks he 's a wonderful poet . " I added , " So does Sandy , we want to give him a reading at the store . " <p> I was surprised to see Kevin bristle a little at this . " Would n't that be sort of taking sides ? " he asked . " In a not very tactful way ? " <p> " How many people from around here go over to a bookstore in Corte Madera ? It takes a goddamn forty minutes . I should know . " <p> " That 's just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kevin . " <p> This was a side of Kevin that I had either not seen or had ignored in Iowa : the conformist , yielding to authority ( deans ) . One could put it more crudely , which to myself I did . But the truth is that in Iowa I had only been aware of a nice voice , great eyes , and later on , in that awful and unforgettable Holiday Inn , great sex . Also , since Kevin was considerably older than I was , not twenty years but a close seventeen , the subject of Arabel and Richard was a little touchy , and became more so . There could come a day , we both knew , when for reasons of age and retirement I would be the one supporting Kevin . <p> Arabel had been wrong about Sandy , I decided . He was n't horny , especially ; just a friendly , slightly depressed , and intelligent guy in his middle thirties , married ten years or so , with two little kids and a heavy mortgage , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booksellers , one of the last of which he felt that he was . <p> We shared wildly promiscuous tastes in literature ; we both loved , with passion , Robert Musil and Alice Munro , Turgenev and Trollope , Iris Murdoch and Anne Perry . Carl Hiaasen . We spoke with happy enthusiasm of all these writers , we tried to sell their work . Sandy did nothing with me that could be construed as " coming on . " Or maybe , I thought , Arabel was wrong about that and I was not his type . <p> In a way he was my type , though not at all like Kevin . Sandy was tall and skinny , gray-blond , nearsighted , a little stooped . He smoked a pipe , an old-fashioned bookish touch that I found endearing . <p> Richard the poet lived in San Francisco , where he drove a Yellow Cab . But he often came to Marin , for solitary hikes on Mt . Tam , or the headlands , near Inverness . And that is where they had met , he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dockside restaurant specializing in seafood . Local oysters . And there they were , Arabel and Richard , side by side at separate tables , out in the sun , scoffing down oysters , washed with white wine . <p> " Very sexy , really , oysters . " Arabel laughed as she recounted this meeting . " We must have both thought of that at about the same time . We looked at each other and we sort of giggled . Although he 's not the giggling type , more a melancholy Dane . Big and blond and serious , sad-looking . We talked , and then , as they say , one thing led to another . " <p> Everything led , eventually , to the marriage counselor , and his ill-advised question . " Was this your first infidelity , Mrs. Kennedy ? " <p> " Well , no- " <p> Leading to Arabel 's list and , a short time later , to a nasty , explosive divorce . <p> That explosion , like a small , lively , and unexpected fire , sent sparks to scatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and quarreled . The side-taking was not always along gender lines , as one might have expected . Some wives felt that Arabel had been " terrible , " she should and no doubt would be punished : Richard would leave her flat for someone at least his own age . And some husbands avowed , in private , that " old Bert " had always been the most colossal bore ; how could a lively and attractive woman put up with him for so long ? A spectrum of other opinions was also **26;874;TOOLONG , drunkenly , lengthily . Former amours of Arabel , who did not know that they formed part of a list , all tended to be loyal . They were grateful , Arabel was a warm and generous woman . They remembered kindness , and wit . <p> We go now to about five years later . Kevin and I are still married , though somewhat less thrillingly so ; however , we have two small children who are , to my amazement , quite agreeable , on the whole . I still work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandy and I , though once intense and furtive lovers , became good friends ( I was " seeing " someone else by then , and so was he ) . Also , when Kevin 's very old father died and considerately left a sizeable chunk to each of us , I invested my share in the store , so that now I am an equal partner . <p> Arabel and I remain friends , although she and Richard ( married ) live in San Francisco , and we do n't see each other a lot . Also , Kevin was one of those husbands most censorious of Arabel and very pro-Bert , of course he was . <p> Richard never gave a reading at our store . He was scheduled for what turned out to be the week of Arabel 's divorce proceedings , and her lawyer felt that for Richard to read at that moment would be " provocative . " ( " And God knows you 've done enough to provoke the guy , " she , the lawyer , lightly scolded , and Arabel agreed . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted here and there by quarterlies , almost enough for a book , very soon . And instead of driving a cab , he does house painting , something else that he is very good at . <p> It is my impression that they get on very well , although Arabel does not discuss the relationship in detail . But then she never did . Once , when we met for coffee in Sausalito ( she is doing substitute teaching , which sometimes brings her to Marin ) , as we sat in the warming sunlight and watched a weather-beaten seagull who watched us from a piling , Arabel said , You know , I 'd never , never be unfaithful to Richard . Is n't that odd ? Or is it ? " <p> I laughed at her . " No , not particularly " For I knew what she meant . <p> As for me , between the store and the children , and sporadic love affairs-sex affairs , really ; not much to do with love-I keep busy . Sometimes I wonder if there 's another Richard somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest woman of me , as they say . But if not , that 's okay , too . As Arabel used to say , it passes the time . And it 's fun . <p>
