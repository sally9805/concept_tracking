Five years ago , the President of the U.S. could n't get arrested , at least not in the show-business sense of the phrase . " No one 's interested in movies about the President , " an agent told me in the spring of 1992 , explaining why we had seen relatively few presidential characters on the big screen since the era of Dr. Strangelove and Seven Days in May back in the ' 60s . " People get enough of him on the news every night . They do n't want to see him at the multiplex . " This was the conventional wisdom in Hollywood at the time . Two enervating elections and four draining ( though interesting ) years of Bill Clinton later , you might think it would still hold true . <P> But 1997 is still young , and already two White House-themed thrillers , Shadow Conspiracy and Absolute Power , have passed through theaters , and a third arrives next week : Murder at 1600 , in which Wesley Snipes , playing a Washington detective , investigates a homicide at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent manifestations of a trend that dates back to Dave , the 1993 comedy in which Kevin Kline plays a gentle presidential impostor . Since then we have probably seen more Presidents onscreen than , say , strippers and volcanologists combined . We have seen Presidents and ex-Presidents as the lead in a romantic comedy ( The American President ) , as crabby partners in a road movie ( My Fellow Americans ) , as an ambiguous foil for action hero Harrison Ford ( Clear and Present Danger ) , as a work-obsessed ' 90s dad ( First Kid ) , as battlers of alien invaders ( Independence Day , Mars Attacks ! ) and , perhaps most disturbing of all , as Alan Alda ( Canadian Bacon ) . <P> This summer , in Air Force One , we will have the opportunity to envision what it would be like to have a Chief Executive , played by Harrison Ford himself , who can deal Die Hard-style with international terrorists when they make the mistake of commandeering his plane . " He 's not a ninja or anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's four producers , " but he knows how to fight . " The back story is that this President served in Vietnam as a helicopter pilot and won a Congressional Medal of Honor for fighting his way out of the jungle after a crash . " At last , " went one of the film 's proposed ( and rejected ) advertising slogans , " America has a kick-ass President . " The ways in which real Presidents respond to terrorism , launch surgical strikes and the like will no doubt seem effete by comparison . <P> The most unusual concept yet for a White House movie  --  one imagines , anyway  --  belongs to Sacred Cows , a notorious and as yet unproduced screenplay by Joe Eszterhas , who is most famous for writing Basic Instinct and Showgirls . Sacred Cows , which is being developed by MGM , tells the story of a President who is caught having a trans-species tryst in a barn . At various times , according to Eszterhas , Steven Spielberg , Milos Forman and Robert Zemeckis have all been attached to the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece , " Eszterhas says . " It ultimately makes the case that the President of the U.S. has to tell the truth . " Indeed , the screenplay 's climax has President Sam Parr confessing to the nation during a debate , " Yes , I diddled that cow ! " Buoyed by his honesty , voters re-elect him in a landslide . " Maybe you 're right , " Eszterhas responds when asked if his script is just too vulgar ever to be made , " but I hope it has something to say . "
