George Bush did not need to go to Colombia to boost his already stratospheric approval ratings . True , he wanted to show his support for Colombian President Virgilio Barco 's war against his country 's entrenched cocaine processors . He also had some serious fence mending to do with Latin leaders aggrieved by the Panama invasion . But while the Cartegena drop-by took place on foreign soil , it was designed for domestic consumption . For Bush to score points at home , all he had to do was go a few rounds on the Medellin cartel 's turf and come back alive . His bold posture is working : 60% of Americans polled last week by TIME/CNN approved of the way Bush is fighting the war on drugs . <P> In the Bush White House , as in high school , there is no such thing as being too popular . Since last fall , Bush 's approval ratings have soared to levels unmatched since John Kennedy 's first year , and they show no sign of abating . In the TIME/CNN poll , 76% approved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , up from 70% two weeks before . While White House aides publicly feign nonchalance about these numbers , privately they are delighted if a bit puzzled . Explained one : " We 're really glad it 's there ; we 're glad people like him . But nobody can explain it . " <P> Much of the credit goes to the three Ps : Peace , Prosperity and Panama . Voters appreciate Bush 's affable nature , his no-nonsense wife Barbara and his flock of grandchildren . Add to that low unemployment and inflation , the collapse of communism in Eastern Europe , the dramatic capture of Manuel Noriega and the sense that Bush loves his impossible job and is working hard at it . This flavorful gumbo has a broad appeal . Bush gets good marks even from a majority of blacks and Democrats . <P> But Bush 's support is as thin as it is wide . Though the TIME/CNN survey shows that Bush wins high marks for his stewardship of foreign policy , he gets markedly lower grades for domestic affairs . While 75% say the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his habit of substituting rhetoric for action . <P> So far , the gap has not hurt him , perhaps because the President 's all-hat- and-no-cattle ( as Bush likes to call showy cowboys ) approach to domestic problems mirrors voters ' own mixed feelings about unfinished business . White House pollster Robert Teeter , who takes monthly soundings , points out that Americans want problems addressed but have little appetite for expensive big fixes . " They want him to be doing something , " says Teeter , " but they do n't want him to go overboard . " <P> Bush has so carefully trod the line between will and wallet that pollsters hear few specific criticisms about him in focus groups and telephone interviews . Michael Donilon , a Washington pollster who in December conducted 200 interviews on Bush , reports that abortion is the only issue that makes people feel " uneasy " about the President . New York Governor Mario Cuomo , a Democrat who praises Bush as " politically brilliant , " adds , " He 's saying all the right things , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
