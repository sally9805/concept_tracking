// Research on memory shows that who you are is limited only by your imagination . When Bill Clinton first ran for president , he gave America sketchy and contradictory reasons for why he never served in Vietnam . But it set off a furor when records revealed that he had used " political pressure "  --  including calls from a U.S. senator and the governor 's office  --  to dodge military service . The right wing had a field day branding Bill a liar . But Clinton may have gotten the memory part right . An emerging understanding of memory reveals that it is not laid down forever like a movie , with the same events occurring in the same order every time . Rather , it is an ongoing process of distillation and revision , more like watching a live version of the TV improv show Whose Line Is It Anyway ? There 's a theme , but no script ; every performance is at once similar and different . Doonesbury cartoonist Garry Trudeau learned this in a very public way When the right wing pilloried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inconsistencies might instead be a simple case of faded memory . He sat down to write about his own draft experience for the New York Times . But his research disclosed a very different story than the one he had been telling friends for the previous 20 years . In that version , Trudeau had drawn a low number in the draft lottery and his three-year student deferment had run out , which meant his call-up was imminent . He spent hours on the phone in emotional calls to friends and family Then he tried to obtain another deferment and interviewed at his local draft board  --  for which , Trudeau noted , " I received a memorable haircut . " Eventually he went home where his father , a physician , diagnosed an ulcer and sent the evidence off to a doctor in New Hampshire . Then Trudeau got his deferment . Or so he thought that 's how it went . ( Read on to learn what really happened . ) The " autobiographical memories " that tell the story of our lives are always undergoing revision  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are continually extracting new information from old experiences and filling in gaps in ways that serve some current demand . Consciously or not , we use imagination to reinvent our past , and with it , our present and future . What 's in a Memory Anyway ? If memories are n't reliable , why do we have them at all ? Memory allows us to learn from our experiences without having to repeat them endlessly Indeed , it allows us to survive . If Fred Flintstone remembers that it 's bad to toss rocks at a saber-toothed tiger , he wo n't commit the same offense a week later . Very few scenarios repeat exactly , so our memories work mostly by extracting the essence of those scenarios . After all , if Fred learns that it 's bad to throw rocks at saber-toothed tigers , he 'll live longer than if he learns only to avoid throwing those rocks at that tiger . But memory is more than a survival tool . Psychologist Ulrich Neisser , Ph.D. , contends it is a kind of social glue . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember life events accurately than to preserve more enduring information about people , relationships and the continuing aspects of events , all of which form the core of human experience . Think about how quickly Thanksgiving dinner descends into conversations that begin , " Hey , remember when we .... " These shared personal histories keep our relationships going . As anyone who has ever sat around swapping stories until the wee hours of the morning knows , what really happened is less critical than what everybody thinks really happened . Enter Imagination But what if one of your siblings interrupted your recounting of a cherished childhood memory and said , " That never happened to you . No way You 're wrong . " How would you find out the truth ? In research we conducted with psychologist Helene Hembrooke , Ph.D. , we asked people this very question . We found that many would not necessarily look for proof , such as photos or medical records , because it seems like too much of a bother . Instead , people imagine the event , and then see if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happened to them . This is an easy strategy , but not a smart one . Research shows that imagining fictitious events , especially ones from childhood , tends to increase our confidence that the events really happened . Imagination Inflation In 1996 , along with psychologists Charles Manning , Ph.D. , and Elizabeth Loftus , Ph.D. , of the University of Washington and James Sherman , Ph.D. , of Indiana University , one of us ( Maryanne Garry ) looked specifically at imagination 's effect on autobiographical memory . We gave people a list of common childhood events ( e.g. , got in trouble for calling 911 , broke a window with your hand ) and asked them to rate their confidence that each had or had not happened to them before age 10 . Weeks later , we asked the same people to imagine some of the events in the survey An experimenter guided them through the exercise : " Imagine that it 's after school and you are playing in the house . You hear a strange noise outside , so you run to the window . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you trip and fall . As you 're falling , you reach out to catch yourself and your hand goes through the window . As the window shatters , you get cut and there 's some blood . " Then we asked the participants again to rate their confidence of the same childhood memories . We found that simply imagining a childhood event for about a minute boosted people 's confidence that the events had really happened . We called this effect " imagination inflation . " Memory can also be altered through what Princeton psychologist Marcia Johnson , Ph.D. , calls " source monitoring . " Typically , when we remember something , we also remember the source of that information . Weeks from now , for example , you may be able to tell a friend about imagination inflation , and that you read about it in PSYCHOLOGY TODAY . You might even be able to tell your friend , " It was in their December issue . " But sometimes we make mistakes and remember the information but confuse the source ( thinking you read about imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tend to remember recent experiences more accurately , getting increasingly foggy as we reach back through the years . Johnson 's research bears this out . She asked people to think of actual or imagined autobiographical events from either the recent past or from childhood , and then had them rate the memories on 39 different characteristics , such as sensory detail , feeling , and what happened just before and after the events . As expected , memories of recent events stayed pretty consistent while memories of childhood events were easily confused with imagined ones  --  on about 90% of the characteristics tested , in fact . Souped-up Selves Of course you do n't confuse just anything you imagine with real life . If you imagine yourself having won the lottery last year , you probably wo n't come to believe you did . Plausibility is important , as is the ease with which you can imagine something . We use our imagination to tweak our memories for a number of reasons . We rely on memories of the past to help us imagine and make sense of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we develop scripts of certain kinds of common experiences so we 'll know how to act in future such situations . We can all imagine what will happen when we go to a restaurant , for example , even if we 've never patronized that particular one . We believe someone will greet us and show us to a table , that a server will take our order , and that when we 're done ( or the restaurant wants us to be done ) , we 'll get the check , add 15% to 20% for a tip , and give it to our server . * Did you remember snore and pillow ? Probably , because we tend to recall the most recent items and those were last on the list . Did you get artichoke ? You probably did because it was distinctive  --  it did n't go with the other words . Did you remember the word night ? It was repeated three times , and that helped you learn it . Did you get the word sleep ? Most likely , though it was n't even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you can go from simple recall to a false memory in a few minutes . Of course , sometimes scripts keep us from imagining an alternative , which can thwart our ability to make sense of the present . In a New Zealand restaurant , for example , you 'd rarely be presented with a check at the end of your meal . That would be seen as unspeakably rude , tantamount to kicking you out . Instead , when you 're ready , you head toward the cash register . In New Zealand , we often see American tourists waiting idly at their tables for a waiter who never comes back . Sometimes people use their imagination to make sense of someone else 's past . In an interview last summer , Hillary Rodham Clinton explained her husband 's persistent infidelity by saying it stemmed from his childhood abuse . " There was terrible conflict between his mother and grandmother , " she had said . " A psychologist told me that being caught in a conflict between two women is the worst possible situation . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill could have fared worse than being in the middle of two women . There are times when imagination gives memories a positive spin . As we age , we tend to cast earlier hardships as experiences that made us stronger . But imagining a better past is n't always useful . How does it help us to be homesick ? Perhaps the biggest myth about memory is that we can forget the seriously bad stuff , a phenomenon called repression or amnesia . Of course it 's possible to forget traumatic events . But scientific study does not support the concept of repression . Most survivors of Nazi concentration camps , terrible accidents or childhood sexual abuse say that they have never forgotten their ordeals , as much they might have liked to . The Malleability of Memory Some people take full advantage of memory 's flexibility . For instance , some athletes repeatedly imagine executing the complex motor skills that lead to victory because research shows that it does boost performance . Similarly advertisers use imagination-based memory tricks to stimulate desire for their products . A little imagination , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take the case of Lynn Gondolf . Her therapist saw her eating disorder as a red flag for repressed memories of childhood abuse . Although Gondolf said from the start that she had been sexually abused by her uncle , her therapist insisted that her parents must have been involved . Gondolf tried to imagine how . She joined a therapy group , took antipsychotics , antidepressants , sleeping pills and ulcer medication , and wound up in a county mental hospital . The funny thing is , she says , one day she decided not to return to the mental hospital  --  because it was too much work . Once she broke away she started to realize that her expanded memories of abuse were false . Some uses of imagination are merely foolish . Innumerable self-help books tout imagination-based interventions such as creative visualization to achieve younger-looking skin . Or to turn you into president of the United States . Some people may be predisposed to imagination-based false memories . Researchers at the University of Tennessee recently showed that those who score high on measures of both hypnotic suggestion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remember driving home ? ) are more likely than others to experience imagination inflation . As we age , hypnotic suggestibility and dissociativity decrease . Young children , therefore , are most adept at imagination inflation . When 8- to 10year-olds imagine hypothetical events from five years earlier , they become more certain than their elders that the events really occurred . Give the Pres a Break But some consequences of imaginationinfluenced memories are not as serious as others . So when Thanksgiving rolls around and your older brother starts regaling revelers with his tale of the time he put a rubber snake in your bed , you can laugh along with everyone else , even if it 's not all true . What 's important is the fact that you 're all together , laughing and enjoying each other 's company . And give the presidential candidates a break , too , when they try to remember what they did or did n't do 20 years ago . Garry Trudeau will . Although he had been telling the same story for 20 years , it did n't jibe with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : His student deferment lasted one year , not three . There were no anguished phone calls ; he had gone out drinking instead . The part about the ulcer is true  --  but Trudeau could n't have seen a New Hampshire doctor because he was n't a state resident . He now thinks he asked an instate friend to lend him a local address . A significant , emotional , important autobiographical memory , riddled with the products of his imagination , right down to the memorable haircut .
