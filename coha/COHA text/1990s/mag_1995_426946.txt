Section : NATIONAL AFFAIRS CRIME <p> ' Copycat ' crimes in New York 's subways reignited the debate : Do TV and movies cause actual mayhem ? The evidence is n't as clear as you might think . <p> In the film " Money Train , " a man douses a New York subway token-booth clerk with a flammable liquid , lights a match and demands her money . When she pushes a bag of cash toward him , he tosses the match at her anyway , laughing sadistically that he is n't in it " for the money . " For New York audiences , this was a horror revisited : in the 1980s , hoodlums terrorized subway clerks with firebombs and lighter fluid , The movie opened on Wednesday , Nov. 22 , and grossed $15 million in its first five days . <p> But its impact seems to have extended beyond the box office . Late Saturday night , three days after the opening , two men in Brooklyn squirted flammable liquid into the token booth manned by Harry Kaufman and blew his small cubicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burns over 75 percent of his body . By midweek two more ' token booths had been attacked or threatened by firebugs . The makers of " Money Train " ardently defended their film , claiming they were only depicting a real crime method . But the incidents read like the latest case of life imitating art-or perhaps life imitating art imitating life ( graphic ) . Bob Dole , who had reaped political mileage denouncing the entertainment industry in May , again lambasted Hollywood last week , calling for a boycott of the movie : " Those who continue to deny that cultural messages can and do bore deep into the hearts and minds of our young people are deceiving themselves and ignoring reality . " <p> This was an easy shot , especially in the wake of such a reprehensible crime . Who could defend the values of " Money Train , " a witless orgy of gratuitous mayhem ? But as with most quick attempts to connect entertainments with real-world violence , the story under this was far more complicated . For starters , the hoods responsible have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the movie . More significant , the incident offers only the most facile look at how violence in the media might affect us . Copycat crimes , even if they hold up underscrutiny , involve only a minuscule fraction of the millions of people who watch the same movie or show . Far more troubling is the question of how our daily immersion in violent media-in aggressive cartoons , brutal sporting events , graphic newscasts , shoot-'em-up movies and TV shows and harsh popular music-affect children and adults in the aggregate . <p> Beneath the huffy sound bites lie nearly 40 years of extremely murky scientific research on the subject . The evidence holds fascinating clues into how our entertainments act on our minds . But it is also far less certain than many of its adherents claim . Researchers routinely cite thousands of studies . Really , there are closer to 200 ; the rest are rehashes of data.The press in turn uneritieally repeats numbers like annual figures for how many violent acts kids see each year , without noting that the figures include acts of nature , cartoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the actual research literature reveals that what we do n't know about media 's effects is often as dramatic as what we do . <p> Nobody believes that media by themselves cause aggression . But Leonard Eron and Rowell Huesmann of the University of Michigan found in a 22-year study following kids from third grade through adulthood that the single best predictor of later aggression-more than poverty , grades , a single-parent home or exposure to real violence-was a heavy childhood diet of TV carnage . " Of course not every youngster is affected , " says Eron . " Not everyone who gets lung cancer smoked cigarettes . And not everyone who smokes cigarettes gets lung cancer . But nobody outside the tobacco industry denies that smoking causes lung cancer . The size of the correlation is the same . " Epidemiologist Brandon S. Centerwall goes so far as to assert that without TV there would be 10,000 fewer murders per year in the United States , 70,000 fewer rapes and 700,000 fewer assaults . <p> Much of the most effective research has been done on children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " Later variations in exposure , in adolescence and adulthood , do not exert any additional effect . " In the early ' 60s , Albert Bandura at Stanford was the first to show that kids learned behavior from TV , not just from their parents . Psychologists have used four theories of learning to describe how TV violence may influence kids : they learn to imitate what they see on TV , especially when it is rewarded ; they learn from the frequency of violence on TV that it is normal ; they become desensitized to real people 's suffering , and they become aroused by images on television , triggering violent responses . Early researchers , following Aristotle , thought media violence might be cathartic , purging violent urges , but experiments have not borne this out . <p> In a classic series of lab experiments in the early 1960s , researchers first frustrated a group of preschool kids , then showed them TV footage of a man hitting a " Bobo " or clown doll . Afterward , the kids who saw the violence were more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies showed that these kids would also spontaneously act out against a man dressed as a clown , indicating that TV violence might spin easily into the real world . In another twist , a group of kids saw a similar footage of a man hitting a doll , but then being spanked for his actions . These children were much less likely to attack the doll themselves . <p> These last results imply that what matters is the type or treatment of violence : that screen mayhem that 's rewarded win encourage aggression , but when it 's punished it win inhibit it . By this logic , a heroic John Wayne movie might be more damaging than a senseless slasher movie , especially if the villain is punished . The experiments also argue that simply tallying the number of violent acts is meaningless . In this case , seeing the most acts of violence ( both a hit doll and a spanking ) made kids the least likely to rumble themselves . <p> Working with adults , Brad Bushman at Iowa State has shown in lab situations that subjects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw , while those previously inclined toward violence were . " Highly aggressive people organize experiences in their memories differently , " he says . Violent entertainment " activates their aggressive thoughts , angry feelings . " Bushman came to his interest in TV violence the tough way . " My electronics teacher owned an audio store . Just before closing one day , two armed men came in and forced the owner and customers down into the basement , forced them to eat Drano and put duct tape over their mouths , just like in the movie ' Magnum Force . ' At trial , one witness testified that these men watched ' Magnum Force ' three times the day before . " <p> Other researchers have questioned whether it was the by-perkinetic form of TV , more than the content , that prompted aggression . Two studies published in the early ' 80s found that programs with heavy action but no violence were just as likely to provoke aggression as those that contained actual mayhem . Dorothy and Jerome Singer at Yale further found that even innocuous programs like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows were so stimulating that they prompted aggression . ( The producers of " Sesame Street " have since slowed the show down . ) <p> The problem with lab studies , though , is that their conditions are artificial and limited . They take material entirely out of context , and do n't look at cumulative effects of our real viewing patterns . The responses measured  --  punching a doll or pushing a shock button-are not real violent responses , only approximations . Further , the responses all come with the sanction of the experimenter . They seem like acceptable behaviors , with no threat of retribution . <p> Two of the most compelling field studies have looked at the way television changed a culture when it was first introduced . In 1973 , Tannis MacBeth Williams studied the kids in a Canadian town before and after the town got TV . She found that creativity dropped and that within two years after the arrival of the tube , rates of hitting , shoving and biting among first and second graders increased by 160 percent . <p> In a somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States , Canada and South Africa after the introduction of TV . In each country , 10 to 15 years after television came in , murder rates doubled . Centerwall explained the lag by reasoning that it took that long for the first young kids exposed to TV to come of age . Even looking at other factors-the baby boom , urbanization , the rise of fire-arms-he claims that none was as viable an explanation as TV . <p> Neither of these studies dealt with the content of TV . Both suggest that it may be the fact of TV  --  the way it changes our social lives , decreases the time kids spend with parents , stimulates material de-sires-that makes our world aggressive , more than the body count in an episode of " NYPD Blue . " <p> George Gerbner , professor and dean emeritus of The Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania , has been studying television and its effects since the 1950s . He argues that the question of whether violent media cause violence misses the point . " It 's a shallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV , he says , shapes a range of responses beyond aggression . So Gerbner devised what he calls a Mean World Syndrome : a measure of how television cultivates " feelings of insecurity , vulnerability and mistrust , and-despite its supposedly ' entertaining ' nature  --  alienation and gloom . " He contends that violence is used to define social relations between characters . " The primary message of violence on TV , " he says , " is who can get away with what against whom . " In a study covering 1982 to 1992 , for example , the researchers found that for every 10 prime-time male characters who commit violence , 11 were victims . But for every 10 female perps , there were 17 female victims . The numbers are even worse for minorities . For every 10 women of color given power , 22 are victimized . The elderly and the poor are also common victims on television . According to Gerbner , viewers then bend their views of the real world according to these ratios . People who watch a lot of television , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to be victims of violence ( in fact , men are one and one-half times as likely to be victims of violent crimes ) . " Some kids see themselves as more likely to be victims than other kids , and they develop a greater sense of vulnerability . Or if they see themselves as more likely to perpetrate violence without consequences , they develop a greater sense of being able to prevail through aggression . " He also found that heavy viewers were more likely to call for severe punishments for criminals , and to have bought new locks , watchdogs and guns " for protection . " <p> Many researchers , though , question Gerbner 's method of counting all acts of violence alike . He answers that no heavy viewer distinguishes between " Henry : Portrait of a Serial Killer " and " Arsenic and Old Lace " and that on TV , even natural phenomena like storms convey a message about power . His work also invites a counter explanation : people who are predisposed to fear the world are also more likely to stay home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV all our lives , there is no such thing as predisposition , " no before and after . TV cultivates the predisposition . " <p> Even if the evidence is inconclusive , it 's hard to dismiss the likelihood of some connection between media and aggression . So what to do ? Gerbner rejects the V-chip  --  a device that would allow parents to block out programs coded for violent content  --  as " a technocratic fantasy . It 's a mindless mechanism . Who programs it ? Do you let the fox guard the chicken coop ? If government decides , it 's unconstitutional . " <p> Both the Singers and Huesmann have designed programs to try to inoculate children from the harmful effects of television . Huesmann asked a group of second graders to help make a videotape on the effects of TV violence , exploring how TV works : how it is not real life ; how copying TV can hurt real people , and so on . Tested later , the kids showed a high skepticism toward media violence ; they were also less aggressive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or push schools to educate young kids about the biases and distortions of television . Unfortunately Huesmann does not think the effects of his program will be long-lasting . " I do n't believe this kind of curriculum alone can solve the problem . It needs to be coupled with reduction in media violence . " <p> For four decades the entertainment industry has resisted such pleas , no matter how great the pressures on it . The body of research against media violence , though spongy , grows larger each year . We may never understand fully just how our entertainments shape our behavior . For now , all we can say for sure is that the subway clerk Harry Kaufman lies in a hospital room , burned in a crime similar to one in a movie . It 's cause for cautious examination , not sound bites . The research has a long way to go , further than its believers claim . But you still might think twice before letting your kids watch Power Rangers . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Grim ' sequel ' : As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token booth was torched <p> By JOHN LELAND with ANDREW MURR and ADAM ROGERS <p> BEWARE OF IMITATIONS <p> " Money Train " is just one of the movies and TV shows blamed for inspiring violence . But like that film 's token-booth torchings , many of these " imitation " crimes happened first in real life . Taxi Driver <p> This 1976 film in which a New York cabby ( Robert De Niro ) attempts to assassinate a presidential candidate was reportedly the inspiration for John Hinckley Jr . ' s shooting President Reagan in 1981 . The Burning Bed <p> A mere half hour after seeing this 1984 TV movie starring Farrah Fawcett , a Milwaukee man burned his estranged wife to death . Fawcett played a real battered wife who killed her husband that way in 1977 .
