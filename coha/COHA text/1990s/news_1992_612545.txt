<p> Do you think the polls should be open longer on election day ? <p> To respond , please leave an answer on the Gwinnett Extra Newsline , 222-2049 or fax an answer to 263-3011 by 4 p.m . Wednesday . <p> Ready to climb aboard ' van ' wagon ? County looking at commuter transport plan that could get federal funding <p> Once it looked as if it might never happen , but county commissioners are beginning to listen to plans that could bring at least one type of public transportation to Gwinnett . <p> Gary Watson , coordinator of the Douglas County van pool , recently explained to county officials how the program in that county works . <p> Douglas has nine daily routes that go Downtown . Up to 15 riders pay a monthly fee of $ 53 to $ 57 . The drivers are also commuters , who pay nothing in exchange for their services in steering through traffic . <p> Although started with federal and local funds , the 6-year-old system now pays for itself . <p> To help defray the costs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one national program , Gwinnett would be eligible for up to $ 834,980 if it put up an additional $ 224,266 . <p> Several commissioners have expressed support for a similar system in Gwinnett . <p> At their request , county employees are putting together a proposal that will be presented later this summer . <p> Each week the Gwinnett Extra asks readers to respond to a question of public interest . <p> Would you commute to work in a county-sponsored van pool ? Good if hours regular <p> No , not from DeKalb County where I live because I do n't keep regular hours . I often arrive early and leave late . But for the people who keep regular hours , which is the vast majority of people , I think a van pool would be wonderful . The van pool is a great idea . <p> I think it would definitely benefit employees . We have van pools in other parts of the company that are very successful in New Jersey , which of course has clean air problems much more severe than Atlanta . <p> Stan Kaufman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would cut time , stress <p> I work Downtown and the commute is very long for me , so I would really like to take advantage of a van pool to lessen my commute time and stress and wear and tear on myself and on my vehicle . <p> I do carpool . By the time I get to MARTA , I might as well drive on in . It only saves me six miles . Otherwise , I have to go to Five Points and transfer . I can drive it twice as fast and have half the aggravation . <p> Even when they talk about MARTA coming out or an express bus , they would go to Gwinnett Place Mall . Well , I 'm across the county . They forget about the rest of the county . <p> It would be nice if there was an express bus at the Park and Ride off U.S. 78 and Hewatt to go from there to Downtown Atlanta or the MARTA station at Avondale . It sure would be worth the money and inconvenience . <p> Sandy Pruss - Snellville <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very interested in riding in a county-sponsored van pool . I work at Piedmont Hospital , so I would be very interested in that . <p> Sandra Hughes - Lawrenceville <p> Yes , I think we need it <p> I would be interested in a van pool from Lawrenceville to Downtown Atlanta . I think this is a need for our community as well as our state . <p> Thank you for allowing us to voice our opinions . <p> Ed Nichols - Lawrenceville <p> Commute is tiresome <p> You bet I would . Sure . I commute halfway to work by driving to the last MARTA station and the other half is riding the train in to Downtown . It 's a very cumbersome and expensive process . <p> In the morning it takes an hour and at night about an hour and 20 minutes . <p> It gets tiresome . <p> Joel Sorenson - Suwanee <p> I think it would be used <p> If I were going to go Downtown and a van pool were available , yes , I would use it . <p> And I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps go on the MARTA line would possibly use this sort of transportation . <p> Pat Mitchell , member Gwinnett school board <p> ' Piece of the puzzle ' <p> I think I would , like driving into Atlanta . I think Gwinnett ought to consider this . It 's real important . <p> You are talking to somebody who is biased . I sat on the chamber transportation committee and was chairman , and the van pool program we have had a lot of discussion about . <p> And I think in an overall transportation program , which in the future will probably involve many things , the van pool concept is just one piece of the puzzle that will improve the traffic situation and ultimately the air quality problem that we 're all facing in the future . <p> Charles Cowart - Council for Quality Growth <p> Vans pleasant , efficient <p> That is assuming it goes where I need to go , yes I would . <p> My first preference would be to live so close to work I could ride my bicycle . That was the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was great . <p> If you ca n't do that , if you are in a position where you do n't need a car during the day , van pooling is a pleasant and efficient way to commute . <p> It also allows you to use the time commuting to read or get caught up on work or something of that nature . <p> Over the years the best and longest-lasting van pools have been set up around large industry , where you have hundreds of employees with the same destination . <p> George W. Black Jr . - Director of Gwinnett transportation department <p> It 's worth considering <p> That is the kind of question we would feel we should poll our members on . <p> On a personal level , I think it 's a very good intermediate answer to transportation problems . I do n't think it solves our long-term issues , and I have no real understanding of the cost factors . But I do think it is something that certainly would be worthy of including in a membership survey . <p> Transportation continues to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to see that on our annual survey that we do for our membership . <p> Brenda Fisk - Chamber of Commerce <p> Driving can be tiring <p> I would definitely be interested in a van pool because it 's a long drive up here when you 're driving five days a week from the city of East Point . That 's quite a distance , and it can have some tiring effects on you . And it gives me a chance to really concentrate on the things that I have to do , coming to work in the morning , and , when I 'm going back home in the evening , then it gives me an opportunity to sit down and think about the things that I have done earlier in the day , to see if there 's anything I could have done differently to make my operation more efficient . So anything that would take the burden off me would be of great benefit to me . It 's about 42 miles one way . Bobby Berry , East Point , Production manager OKI telecom in Suwanee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love affair with my vehicle . I do n't use public transportation . <p> Anna Roupe - Snellville <p> If extremely convenient <p> No , I would n't . Of course if it was extremely convenient , you know , rather than drive my own car , but not normally . <p> If I have to take my car out , I 'm going to drive to work . I wo n't drive to another method of transportation . <p> Theron Fice - Snellville <p> Do n't import workers <p> No . The county-sponsored van pool is another way to import low-wage earners into Gwinnett at a cost to the taxpayers of Gwinnett . <p> Jim Carter - Centerville <p> Would help ease traffic <p> Sure . I think it 's something we could use . I think it would be helpful because it would get some traffic off the roads and have a positive impact on the environment . <p> And it would be a convenience to employees in terms of transportation . <p> Don Donnellan - National sales manager Computer Communications Specialists Inc. , Norcross <p> ' Van pools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer from a company point of view because the decision to participate in a van pool is a very personal one . <p> We , meaning Avon , currently have employees that commute to our facility in Gwinnett from Cobb County in a county-sponsored van pool . This has been of assistance to those employees , and I understand that they also have picked up employees from Fulton County . This group has proved that van pools do work . <p> Rosalind Jackson - Human resources manager for Avon <p> We 'd tell employees <p> If such a plan were available , we 'd certainly make it known to employees . <p> Bill Brobst Director of corporate communications Scientific-Atlanta Inc.
