CA N'T GO ON , " HIS BROTHER said . <p> Tsuyoshi Shimizu looked thoughtfully into the screen of his pasokon . His older brother 's face was shiny with sweat from a late-night drinking bout . " It 's only a career , " said Tsuyoshi , sitting up on his futon and adjusting his pajamas . " You worry too much . " <p> " All that overtime ! " his brother whined . He was making the call from a bar somewhere in Shibuya . In the background , a middle-aged office lady was singing karaoke , badly . " And the examination hells . The manager training programs . The proficiency tests . I never have time to live ! " <p> Tsuyoshi grunted sympathetically . He did n't like these late-night videophone calls , but he felt obliged to listen . His big brother had always been a decent sort , before he had gone through the elite courses at Waseda University , joined a big corporation , and gotten professionally ambitious . <p> " My back hurts , " his brother groused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going gray . And I know they 'll fire me . No matter how loyal you are to the big companies , they have no loyalty to their employees anymore . It 's no wonder that I drink . " <p> " You should get married , " Tsuyoshi offered . <p> " I ca n't find the right girl . Women never understand me . " He shuddered . " Tsuyoshi , I 'm truly desperate . The market pressures are crushing me . I ca n't breathe . My life has got to change . I 'm thinking of taking the vows . I 'm serious ! I want to renounce this whole modern world . " <p> Tsuyoshi was alarmed . " You 're very drunk , right ? " <p> His brother leaned closer to the screen . " Life in a monastery sounds truly good to me . It 's so quiet there . You recite the sutras . You consider your existence . There are rules to follow , and rewards that make sense . It 's just the way that Japanese business used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tsuyoshi grunted skeptically . <p> " Last week I went out to a special place in the mountains ... Mount Aso , " his brother confided . " The monks there , they know about people in trouble , people who are burned out by modem life . The monks protect you from the world . No computers , no phones , no faxes , no e-mail , no overtime , no commuting , nothing at all . It 's beautiful , and it 's peaceful , and nothing ever happens there . Really , it 's like paradise . " <p> " Listen , older brother , " Tsuyoshi said , " you 're not a religious man by nature . You 're a section chief for a big import-export company . " <p> " Well ... maybe religion wo n't work for me . I did think of running away to America . Nothing much ever happens there , either . " <p> Tsuyoshi smiled . " That sounds much better ! America is a good vacation spot . A long vacation is just what you need ! Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their handguns . " <p> " But I ca n't go through with it , " his brother wailed . " I just do n't dare . I ca n't just wander away from everything that I know , and trust to the kindness of strangers . " <p> " That always works for me , " Tsuyoshi said . " Maybe you should try it . " <p> Tsuyoshi 's wife stirred uneasily on the futon . Tsuyoshi lowered his voice . " Sorry , but I have to hang up now . Call me before you do anything rash . " <p> " Do n't tell Dad , " Tsuyoshi 's brother said . " He worries so . " <p> " I wo n't tell Dad . " Tsuyoshi cut the connection and the screen went dark . <p> Tsuyoshi 's wife rolled over , heavily . She was seven months pregnant . <p> She stared at the ceiling , puffing for breath . " Was that another call from your brother ? " she said . <p> " Yeah . The company just gave him another promotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That sounds nice , " his wife said tactfully . <p> NEXT MORNING , Tsuyoshi slept late . He was selfemployed , so he kept his own hours . Tsuyoshi was a video format upgrader by trade . He transferred old videos from obsolete formats into the new high-grade storage media . Doing this properly took a craftsman 's eye . Word of Tsuyoshi 's skills had gotten out on the network , so he had as much work as he could handle . <p> At ten A.M. , the mailman arrived . Tsuyoshi abandoned his breakfast of raw egg and miso soup , and signed for a shipment of flaking , twentiethcentury analog television tapes . The mail also brought a fresh overnight shipment of strawberries , and a homemade jar of pickles . <p> " Pickles ! " his wife enthused . " People are so nice to you when you 're pregnant . " <p> " Any idea who sent us that " <p> " Just someone on the network . " " Great . " <p> Tsuyoshi booted his mediator , cleaned his superconducting heads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone 's grandmother as a child , presumably . There had been a lot of flaking and loss of polarity in the old recording medium . <p> Tsuyoshi got to work with his desktop fractal detail generator , the image stabilizer , and the interlace algorithms . When he was done , Tsuyoshi 's new digital copies would look much sharper , cleaner , and better composed than the original primitive videotape . <p> Tsuyoshi enjoyed his work . Quite often he came across bits and pieces of videotape that were of archival interest . He would pass the images on to the net . The really big network databases , with their armies of search engines , indexers , and catalogues , had some very arcane interests . The net machines would never pay for data , because the global information networks were noncommercial . But the net machines were very polite , and had excellent net etiquette . They returned a favor for a favor , and since they were machines with excellent , enormous memories , they never forgot a good deed . <p> Tsuyoshi and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to go shopping . A shipment arrived by overseas package service . Cute baby clothes from Darwin , Australia . They were in his wife 's favorite color , sunshine yellow . <p> Tsuyoshi finished transferring the first tape to a new crystal disk . Time for a break . He left his apartment , took the elevator and went out to the comer coffeeshop . He ordered a double iced mocha cappuccino and paid with a chargecard . <p> His pokkecon rang . Tsuyoshi took it from his belt and answered it . " Get one to go , " the machine told him . <p> " Okay , " said Tsuyoshi , and hung up . He bought a second coffee , put a lid on it and left the shop . <p> A man in a business suit was sitting on a park bench near the entrance of Tsuyoshi 's building . The man 's suit was good , but it looked as if he 'd slept in it . He was holding his head in his hands and rocking gently back and forth . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang again . " The coffee 's for him ? " Tsuyoshi said . <p> " Yes , " said the pokkecon . " He needs it . " <p> Tsuyoshi walked up to the lost businessman . The man looked up , flinching warily , as if he were about to be kicked . " What is it ? " he said . " Here , " Tsuyoshi said , handing him the cup . " Double iced mocha cappuccino . " <p> The man opened the cup , and smelled it . He looked up in disbelief . " This is my favorite kind of coffee .... Who are you ? " <p> Tsuyoshi lifted his arm and offered a hand signal , his fingers clenched like a cat 's paw . The man showed no recognition of the gesture . Tsuyoshi shrugged , and smiled . " It does n't matter . Sometimes a man really needs a coffee . Now you have a coffee . That 's all . " <p> " Well .... " The man cautiously sipped his cup , and suddenly smiled . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're welcome . " Tsuyoshi went home . <p> His wife arrived from shopping . She had bought new shoes . The pregnancy was making her feet swell . She sat carefully on the couch and sighed . <p> " Orthopedic shoes are expensive , " she said , looking at the yellow pumps . " I hope you do n't think they look ugly . " <p> " On you , they look really cute , " Tsuyoshi said wisely . He had first met his wife at a video store . She had just used her credit card to buy a disk of primitive black-and-white American anime of the 1950s . The pokkecon had urged him to go up and speak to her on the subject of Felix the Cat . Felix was an early television cartoon star and one of Tsuyoshi 's personal favorites . <p> Tsuyoshi would have been too shy to approach an attractive woman on his own , but no one was a stranger to the net . This fact gave him the confidence to speak to her . Tsuyoshi had soon discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for cute , antique , animated cats . They 'd had lunch together . They 'd had a date the next week . They had spent Christmas Eve together in a love hotel . They had a lot in common . <p> She had come into his life through a little act of grace , a little gift from Felix the Cat 's magic bag of tricks . Tsuyoshi had never gotten over feeling grateful for this . Now that he was married and becoming a father , Tsuyoshi Shimizu could feel himself becoming solidly fixed in life . He had a man 's role to play now . He knew who he was , and he knew where he stood . Life was good to him . <p> " You need a haircut , dear , " his wife told him . <p> " Sure . " <p> His wife pulled a gift box out of her shopping bag . " Can you go to the Hotel Daruma , and get your hair cut , and deliver this box for me ? " <p> " What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden gift box . A maneki neko was nestled inside white foam padding . The smiling ceramic cat held one paw upraised , beckoning for good fortune . <p> " Do n't you have enough of those yet ? " he said . " You even have maneki neko underwear . " <p> " It 's not for my collection . It 's a gift for someone at the Hotel Daruma . " <p> " Oh . " <p> " Some foreign woman gave me this box at the shoestore . She looked American . She could n't speak Japanese . She had really nice shoes , though .... " <p> " If the network gave you that little cat , then you 're the one who should take care of that obligation , dear . " <p> " But dear , " she sighed , " my feet hurt so much , and you could do with a haircut anyway , and I have to cook supper , and besides , it 's not really a nice maneki neko , it 's just cheap tourist souvenir junk . Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " Tsuyoshi told her . " Just forward your pokkecon prompts onto my machine , and I 'll see what I can do for us . " <p> She smiled . " I knew you would do it . You 're really so good to me . " <p> Tsuyoshi left with the little box . He was n't unhappy to do the errand , as it was n't always easy to manage his pregnant wife 's volatile moods in their small six-tatami apartment . The local neighborhood was good , but he was hoping to find bigger accommodations before the child was born . Maybe a place with a little studio , where he could expand the scope of his work . It was very hard to find decent housing in Tokyo , but word was out on the net . Friends he did n't even know were working every day to help him . If he kept up with the net 's obligations , he had every confidence that some day something nice would turn up . <p> Tsuyoshi went into the local pachinko parlor , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chargecard . He drank the beer , took the new train card and wedged himself into the train . He got out at the Ebisu station , and turned on his pokkecon Tokyo street map to guide his steps . He walked past places called Chocolate Soup , and Freshness Physique , and The Aladdin Mai-Tai Panico Trattoria . <p> He entered the Hotel Daruma and went to the hotel barber shop , which was called the Daruma Planet Look . " May I help you ? " said the receptionist . <p> " I 'm thinking a shave and a trim , " Tsuyoshi said . <p> " Do you have an appointment with us ? " <p> " Sorry , no . " Tsuyoshi offered a hand gesture . <p> The woman gestured back , a jerky series of cryptic finger movements . Tsuyoshi did n't recognize any of the gestures . She was n't from his part of the network . <p> " Oh well , never mind , " the receptionist said kindly . " I 'll get Nahoko to look after you . " <p> Nahoko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the pokkecon rang . Tsuyoshi answered it . <p> " Go to the ladies ' room on the fourth floor , " the pokkecon told him . <p> " Sorry , I ca n't do that . This is Tsuyoshi Shimizu , not Ai Shimizu . Besides , I 'm having my hair cut right now . " <p> " Oh , I see , " said the machine . " Recalibrating . " It hung up . <p> Nahoko finished his hair . She had done a good job . He looked much better . A man who worked at home had to take special trouble to keep up appearances . The pokkecon rang again . <p> " Yes ? " said Tsuyoshi . <p> " Buy bay rum aftershave . Take it outside . " <p> " Right . " He hung up . " Nahoko , do you have bay rum ? " <p> " Odd you should ask that , " said Nahoko . " Hardly anyone asks for bay rum anymore , but our shop happens to keep it in stock . " <p> Tsuyoshi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing happened , so he bought a manga comic and waited . Finally a hairy , blond stranger in shorts , a tropical shirt , and sandals approached him . The foreigner was carrying a camera bag and an old-fashioned pokkecon . He looked about sixty years old , and he was very tall . <p> The man spoke to his pokkecon in English . " Excuse me , " said the pokkecon , translating the man 's speech into Japanese . " Do you have a bottle of bay rum aftershave ? . " <p> " Yes I do . " Tsuyoshi handed the bottle over . " Here . " <p> " Thank goodness ! " said the man , his words relayed through his machine . " I 've asked everyone else in the lobby . Sorry I was late . " <p> " No problem , " said Tsuyoshi . " That 's a nice pokkecon you have there . " <p> " Well , " the man said , " I know it 's old and out of style . But I plan to buy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sell pokkecons by the basketful in Akihabara electronics market . " <p> " That 's right . What kind of translator program are you running ? Your translator talks like someone from Osaka . " <p> " Does it sound funny ? " the tourist asked anxiously . <p> " Well , I do n't want to complain , but .... " Tsuyoshi smiled . " Here , let 's trade meishi . I can give you a copy of a brand-new freeware translator . " <p> " That would be wonderful . " They pressed buttons and squirted copies of their business cards across the network link . <p> Tsuyoshi examined his copy of the man 's electronic card and saw that his name was Zimmerman . Mr. Zimmerman was from New Zealand . Tsuyoshi activated a transfer program . His modern pokkecon began transferring a new translator onto Zimmerman 's machine . <p> A large American man in a padded suit entered the lobby of the Daruma . The man wore sunglasses , and was sweating visibly in the summer heat . The American looked huge , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese woman followed him . The woman was sharply dressed , with a dark blue dress suit , hat , sunglasses , and an attach6 case . She had a haunted look . <p> Her escort turned and carefully watched the bellhops , who were bringing in a series of bags . The woman walked crisply to the reception desk and began making anxious demands of the clerk . <p> " I 'm a great believer in machine translation , " Tsuyoshi said to the tall man from New Zealand . " I really believe that computers help human beings to relate in a much more human way . " <p> " I could n't agree with you more , " said Mr. Zimmerman , through his machine . " I can remember the first time I came to your country , many years ago . I had no portable translator . In fact , I had nothing but a printed phrasebook . I happened to go into a bar , and ... " <p> Zimmerman stopped and gazed alertly at his pokkecon . " Oh dear , I 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room right away . " <p> " Then I 'll come along with you till this software transfer is done , " Tsuyoshi said . <p> " That 's very kind of you . " They got into the elevator together . Zimmerman punched for the fourth floor . " Anyway , as I was saying , I went into this bar in Roppongi late at night , because I was jedagged and hoping for something to eat ... " <p> " Yes ? " <p> " And this woman ... well , let 's just say this woman was hanging out in a foreigner 's bar in Roppongi late at night , and she was n't wearing a whole lot of clothes , and she did n't look like she was any better than she ought to be .... " <p> " Yes , I think I understand you . " <p> " Anyway , this menu they gave me was full of kanji , or katakana , or romanji , or whatever they call those , so I had my phrasebook out , and I was trying very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elevator opened and they stepped into the carpeted hall of the hotel 's fourth floor . " So I opened the menu and I pointed to an entree , and I told this girl .... " Zimmerman stopped suddenly , and stared at his screen . " Oh dear , something 's happening . Just a moment . " <p> Zimmerman carefully studied the instructions on his pokkecon . Then he pulled the bottle of bay run from the baggy pocket of his shorts , and unscrewed the cap . He stood on tiptoe , stretching to his full height , and carefully poured the contents of the bottle through the iron louvers of a ventilation grate , set high in the top of the wall . <p> ZIMMERMAN screwed the cap back on neatly , and slipped the empty bottle back in his pocket . Then he examined his pokkecon again . He frowned , and shook it . The screen had frozen . Apparently Tsuyoshi 's new translation program had overloaded Zimmerman 's old-fashioned operating system . His pokkecon had crashed . <p> Zimmerman spoke a few defeated sentences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands apologetically . He bowed , and went into his room , and shut the door . <p> The Japanese woman and her burly American escort entered the hall . The man gave Tsuyoshi a hard stare . The woman opened the door with a passcard . Her hands were shaking . <p> Tsuyoshi 's pokkecon rang . " Leave the hall , " it told him . " Go downstairs . Get into the elevator with the bellboy . " <p> Tsuyoshi followed instructions . <p> The bellboy was just entering the elevator with a cart full of the woman 's baggage . Tsuyoshi got into the elevator , stepping carefully behind the wheeled metal cart . " What floor , sir ? " said the bellboy . <p> " Eight , " Tsuyoshi said , ad-libbing . The bellboy turned and pushed the buttons . He faced forward attentively , his gloved hands folded . <p> The pokkecon flashed a silent line of text to the screen . " Put the gift box inside her flight bag , " it read . <p> Tsuyoshi located the zippered blue bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter of instants to zip it open , put in the box with the maneki neko , and zip the bag shut again . The bellboy noticed nothing . He left , tugging his cart . <p> Tsuyoshi got out on the eighth floor , feeling slightly foolish . He wandered down the hall , found a quiet nook by an ice machine and called his wife . " What 's going on ? " he said . <p> " Oh , nothing . " She smiled . " Your haircut looks nice ! Show me the back of your head . " <p> Tsuyoshi held the pokkecon screen behind the nape of his neck . <p> " They do good work , " his wife said with satisfaction . " I hope it did n't cost too much . Are you coming home now ? " <p> " Things are getting a little odd here at the hotel , " Tsuyoshi told her . " I may be some time . " <p> His wife frowned . " Well , do n't miss supper . We 're having bonito . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped at the fourth floor . The woman 's American companion stepped onto the elevator . His nose was running and his eyes were streaming with tears . <p> " Are you all right ? " Tsuyoshi said . <p> " I do n't understand Japanese , " the man growled . The elevator doors shut . <p> The man 's cellular phone crackled into life . It emitted a scream of anguish and a burst of agitated female English . The man swore and slammed his hairy fist against the elevator 's emergency button . The elevator stopped with a lurch . An alarm bell began ringing . <p> The man pried the doors open with his large hairy fingers and clambered out into the fourth floor . He then ran headlong down the hall . <p> The elevator began buzzing in protest , its doors shuddering as if broken . Tsuyoshi climbed hastily from the damaged elevator , and stood there in the hallway . He hesitated a moment . Then he produced his pokkecon and loaded his Japanese-to-English translator . He walked cautiously after the American man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke aloud into his pokkecon . " Hello ? " he said experimentally . " May I be of help ? " The woman was sitting on the bed . She had just discovered the maneki neko box in her flight bag . She was staring at the little cat in horror . <p> " Who are you ? " she said , in bad Japanese . <p> Tsuyoshi realized suddenly that she was a Japanese American . Tsuyoshi had met a few Japanese Americans before . They always troubled him . They looked fairly normal from the outside , but their behavior was always bizarre . " I 'm just a passing friend , " he said . " Something I can do ? " <p> " Grab him , Mitch ! " said the woman in English . The American man rushed into the hall and grabbed Tsuyoshi by the arm . His hands were like steel bands . <p> Tsuyoshi pressed the distress button on his pokkecon . <p> " Take that computer away from him , " the woman ordered in English . Mitch quickly took Tsuyoshi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He deftly patted Tsuyoshi 's clothing , searching for weapons . Then he shoved Tsuyoshi into a chair . <p> The woman switched back to Japanese . " Sit right there , you . Do n't you dare move . " She began examining the contents of Tsuyoshi 's wallet . <p> " I beg your pardon ? " Tsuyoshi said . His pokkecon was lying on the bed . Lines of red text scrolled up its little screen as it silently issued a series of emergency net alerts . <p> The woman spoke to her companion in English . Tsuyoshi 's pokkecon was still translating faithfully . " Mitch , go call the local police . " <p> Mitch sneezed uncontrollably.Tsuyoshi noticed that the room smelled strongly of bay rum . " I ca n't talk to the local cops . I ca n't speak Japanese . " Mitch sneezed again . <p> " Okay , then I 'll call the cops . You handcuff this guy . Then go down to the infirmary and get yourself some antihistamines , for Christ 's sake . " <p> Mitch pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and attached Tsuyoshi 's right wrist to the head of the bed . He mopped his streaming eyes with a tissue . " I 'd better stay with you . If there 's a cat in your luggage , then the criminal network already knows we 're in Japan . You 're in danger . " <p> " Mitch , you may be my bodyguard , but you 're breaking out in hives . " <p> " This just is n't supposed to happen , " Mitch complained , scratching his neck . " My allergies never interfered with my job before . " <p> " Just leave me here and lock the door , " the woman told him . " I 'll put a chair against the knob . I 'll be all right . You need to look after yourself . " <p> Mitch left the room . <p> The woman barricaded the door with a chair . Then she called the front desk on the hotel 's bedside pasokon . " This is Louise Hashimoto in room 434 . I have a gangster in my room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Tokyo police , please ? Tell them to send the organized crime unit . Yes , that 's right . Do it . And you should put your hotel security people on full alert . There may be big trouble here . You 'd better hurry . " She hung up . <p> Tsuyoshi stared at her in astonishment . " Why are you doing this ? What 's all this about ? " <p> " So you call yourself Tsuyoshi Shimizu , " said the woman , examining his credit cards . She sat on the foot of the bed and stared at him . " You 're yakuza of some kind , right ? " <p> " I think you 've made a big mistake , " Tsuyoshi said . <p> Louise scowled . " Look , Mr. Shimizu , you 're not dealing with some Yankee tourist here . My name is Louise Hashimoto and I 'm an assistant federal prosecutor from Providence , Rhode Island , USA .

" <p> " You can stop with the innocent act right now . I spotted you out in the hall earlier , and in the lobby , too , casing the hotel . How did you know my bodyguard is violently allergic to bay rum ? You must have read his medical records . " <p> " Who , me ? Never ! " <p> " Ever since I discovered you network people , it 's been one big pattern , " said Louise . " It 's the biggest criminal conspiracy I ever saw . I busted this software pirate in Providence . He had a massive network server and a whole bunch of AI freeware search engines . We took him in custody , we bagged all his search engines , and catalogs , and indexers .... Later that very same day , these cats start showing up . " <p> " Cats ? " <p> Louise lifted the maneki neko , handling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Japanese voodoo cats . Maneki neko , right ? They started showing up everywhere I went . There 's a china cat in my handbag . There 's three china cats at the office . Suddenly they 're on display in the windows of every antique store in Providence . My car radio starts making meowing noises at me . " <p> " You broke part of the network ? " Tsuyoshi said , scandalized " You took someone 's machines away ? That 's terrible ! How could you do such an inhuman thing ? " <p> " You 've got a real nerve complaining about that . What about my machinery ? " Louise held up her fat , eerie-looking American pokkecon . " As soon as I stepped off the airplane at Narita , my PDA was attacked . Thousands and thousands of e-mail messages . All of them pictures of cats . A denial-of-service attack ! I ca n't even communicate with the home office ! My PDA 's useless ! " <p> " What 's a PDA ?

Make jokes about it . You 're involved in a malicious software attack on a legal officer of the United States Government . You 'll see . " She paused , looking him over . " You know , Shimizu , you do n't look much like the Italian mafia gangsters I have to deal with , back in Providence . " <p> " I 'm not a gangster at all . I never do anyone any harm . " <p> " Oh no ? " Louise glowered at him . " Listen , pal , I know a lot more about your set-up , and your kind of people , than you think I do . I 've been studying your outfit for a long time now .

You 're living through kickbacks ! And bribes ! And influence peddling ! And all kinds of corrupt off-thebooks transactions ! " <p> Tsuyoshi blinked . " Look , I do n't know anything about all that . I 'm just living my life . " <p> " Well , your network gift economy is undermining the lawful , government approved , regulated economy ! " <p> " Well , " Tsuyoshi said gently , " maybe my economy is better than your economy . " <p> " Says who ? ' she scoffed . " Why would anyone think that ?

" <p> Louise bristled . " You 're saying I 'm barbaric ? " " I do n't mean to complain , " Tsuyoshi said politely , " but you do have me tied up to your bed . " <p> Louise crossed her arms . " You might as well stop complaining . You 'll be in much worse trouble when the local police arrive . " <p> " Then we 'll probably be waiting here for quite a while , " Tsuyoshi said .

" I have n't kidnapped you ! I 'm only detaining you here until the local authorities can come and arrest you . " <p> " Arrest me for what , exactly ? " <p> Louise thought quickly . " Well , for poisoning my bodyguard by pouring bay rum into the ventilator . " <p> " But I never did that . Anyway , that 's not illegal , is it ? " <p> The pasokon rang again .

She crawled slowly from beneath the bed , and sat on the mattress . Somehow , the darkness had made them more intimate . " I know very well what this is . I 'm under attack .

Mitch tumbled through , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guards were trying to grab him . Shouting incoherently in English , Mitch fell headlong to the floor , kicking and thrashing . The guards lost their hats in the struggle . One tackled Mitch 's legs with both his arms , and the other whacked and jabbed him with a baton . <p> Puffing and grunting with effort , they hauled Mitch out of the room . The darkened room was so full of steam that the harried guards had n't even noticed Tsuyoshi and Louise . <p> Louise stared at the broken door . " Why did they do that to him ? " <p> Tsuyoshi scratched his head in embarrassment . " Probably a failure of communication . " <p> " Poor Mitch ! They took his gun away at the airport . He had all kinds of technical problems with his passport .... Poor guy , he 's never had any luck since he met me . " <p> There was a loud tapping at the window . Louise shrank back in fear . Finally she gathered her courage , and opened the curtains . Daylight flooded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the roof of the hotel , on cables and pulleys . There were two window-washers in crisp gray uniforms . They waved cheerfully , making little catpaw gestures . <p> There was a third man with them . It was Tsuyoshi 's brother . <p> One of the washers opened the window with a utility key . Tsuyoshi 's brother squirmed into the room . He stood up and carefully adjusted his coat and tie . <p> " This is my brother , " Tsuyoshi explained . <p> " What are you doing here ? " Louise said . <p> " They always bring in the relatives when there 's a hostage situation , " Tsuyoshi 's brother said . " The police just flew me in by helicopter and landed me on the roof . " He looked Louise up and down . " Miss Hashimoto , you just have time to escape . " <p> " What ? " she said . <p> " Look down at the streets , " he told her . " See that ? You hear them ? Crowds are pouring in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone with wheels . Street noodle salesmen . Bicycle messengers . Skateboard kids . Takeout delivery guys . " <p> Louise gazed out the window into the streets , and shrieked aloud . " Oh no ! A giant swarming mob ! They 're surrounding me ! I 'm doomed ! " <p> " You are not doomed , " Tsuyoshi 's brother told her intently . " Come out the window . Get onto the platform with us . You 've got one chance , Louise . It 's a place I know , a sacred place in the mountains . No computers there , no phones , nothing . " He paused . " It 's a sanctuary for people like us . And I know the way . " <p> She gripped his suited arm . " Can I trust you ? " <p> " Look in my eyes , " he told her . " Do n't you see ? Yes , of course you can trust me . We have everything in common . " <p> Louise stepped out the window . She clutched his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creaked rapidly up and out of sight . <p> Tsuyoshi stood up from the chair . When he stretched out , tugging at his handcuffed wrist , he was just able to reach his pokkecon with his fingertips . He drew it in , and clutched it to his chest . Then he sat down again , and waited patiently for someone to come and give him freedom . <p> Author Affiliation
