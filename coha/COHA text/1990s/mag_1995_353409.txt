Republican consultant Ed Rollins has a way of getting his clients in trouble . At a roast in California on May 15 , Rollins , a part-time volunteer for Bob Dole , suggested that California Democrat Willie Brown might run for mayor of San Francisco  --  and not Los Angeles  --  because Brown did n't want to let " Hymie boys " from L.A. push him around . It was the kind of gaffe that might have paralyzed a fledgling presidential campaign . But at Dole headquarters in Washington , no one came unhinged . Instead , sources told Time , campaign manager Scott Reed telephoned Rollins last Monday and asked him to step down . Ed Rollins no longer works for the Dole campaign . Simple as that . <P> Dole has run for President twice before , and it shows . In all the important measures , he is out front : raising ample funds , locking up major endorsements , leading the polls and avoiding self-defeating mistakes . In such key states as Iowa , New Hampshire and South Carolina , Dole is well ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , but the fact that he is staying there has frustrated the popular wisdom that an early front runner is doomed to fall . This time it 's the also-rans who are doing that . His rivals have stumbled and stagnated , which means that each week without a Dole misstep reduces the chances that they will ever catch up . The growing sense that the second tier is fading , however , has raised the prospect that other contenders will jump in , chief among them Newt Gingrich . <P> So far , no strong runner-up has emerged . California Governor Pete Wilson remained sidelined last week after the removal of a benign nodule from his right vocal cord and missed his staff 's planned deadline to enter the race officially by Memorial Day . There is also internal strife : top Wilson aide George Gorton went on " vacation " after Wilson tapped former Bush aide Craig Fuller to run the campaign . Phil Gramm of Texas , still smarting from the disclosure of his R-rated movie endeavor in 1974 , has watched his approval ratings stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Tennessee Governor Lamar Alexander was embarrassed by his failure so far to get an endorsement , as his aides had touted , from popular Michigan Governor John Engler . <P> The normally skeptical Dole , returning from a two-day trip last week to Green Bay , Wisconsin , and Atlantic City , New Jersey , admitted to a lieutenant , " It feels good out there . " This campaign is different from his previous outings . Discipline is now a more regular companion . Prior to his announcement swing in April , Dole spent some time at his Washington headquarters delivering his stump speech to an empty TV studio . He was n't keen about the idea-and he did n't deliver it very well . But his aides first tested the speech 's broad themes with a focus group of Republican men and women in Fredericksburg , Virginia . Next they showed the tape to a " dial group ' ' of 30 Republicans  --  some committed to Dole , some not  --  in Cobb County , Georgia . Each was given a hand-held dial to register his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more . Officials at other campaigns scoff at the front runner 's overcalibration , but the careful market testing has helped Dole move away from talking about process and toward more presidential-sounding themes .
