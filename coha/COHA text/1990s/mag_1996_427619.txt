Section : U.S. News Why violence and social problems are taking their toll in South Boston <p> It could have been a vigil for those who have died young in almost any urban slum in America . Except that a teenage girl read a Gaelic blessing and a man in a kilt played " Amazing Grace " on the bagpipes . Unlike more familiar victims of inner-city violence and poverty , the dead honored at this vigil  --  Jimmy Noonan , John Pozniak , Stephen Dizoglio and others  --  shared one unexpected trait . Irish , Italian , Lithuanian or Polish  --  all but a handful were white . <p> Last month , some 200 people lined the center aisle of South Boston 's majestic Gate of Heaven Catholic Church for a memorial service that never made the nightly news . One by one , they lit candles at the altar , then invoked the names of lost loved ones . Mothers with infants cradled in their arms , young fathers wearing New England Patriots jackets , and children barely tall enough to reach the microphone recited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died from gunshot wounds , beatings , drugs or suicides , with the rest dying of accidents and illnesses . <p> Paul Rakauskas told the gathering about the agony of losing his only son , 15-year-old P.J. , to a drug overdose . The 6-foot , 290-pound biker , clad in a black leather jacket , confessed in a quavering voice : " Gone are the dreams of finally seeing someone from my end of the family ' make it out of the depths . ' " <p> Climbing out . In South Boston , one way to climb out of the depths is to leave behind the public-housing projects on the southern tip  --  " the lower end . " Two years ago , U.S. News identified 15 white underclass city neighborhoods , areas where most residents were non-Hispanic whites , 40 percent or more lived in poverty , and many children were raised by single parents . Topping the list , with the highest share of white families headed by a single mother of any white slum , was a section of South Boston 's lower end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Many of the vigil 's victims came from the two housing projects , Old Colony and the Mary Ellen McCormack Homes , that dominate the neighborhood . <p> America has long been home to millions of poor whites , from the Okie migrants of the 1930s to the Appalachian families of the 1960s . Yet poor whites have usually not been crowded into impoverished neighborhoods that resemble well-publicized black ghettos . While the country has more poor whites than poor blacks , more blacks than whites live in city slums . The Urban Institute reports that in 1990 , 4.2 million blacks lived in black ghettos , compared with 1.6 million whites in white slums . Nonetheless , in white slums , as in black ones , many residents have dropped out of school , given up looking for work , become dependent on public aid ( table , Page 51 ) and been stricken by violence . <p> These social ills reflect the loss of manufacturing jobs and migration of low-wage work out of inner cities as well as a surge in family breakdowns and out-of-wedlock births among whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and last year poverty dropped among most groups , including the black inner-city poor . But the number of poor central-city whites rose by at least 183,000 , according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities . In urban areas , the small white underclass appears to be growing . <p> Like the lives of other kids in South Boston 's projects , P.J. Rakauskas 's was marked by a mix of vice and innocence , of abrupt violence and cocoonlike calm . In the days before he died , P.J. would lie back on his bed to admire his initials , which he spelled out on a wall with glow-in-the-dark stars , or he would flex his skinny biceps and tell his father , " That 's a real man , Dad . " A few weeks before he overdosed , his parents gave him his first Schick razor and a can of shaving cream for Christmas . <p> But P.J. also drank , smoked pot and cut school when he could . He got picked up by the cops when he attacked his sister 's boyfriend with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's own battle with addiction exposed P.J. to drugs at a tender age . Paul is a recovering IV-drug user and has been clean for nine years . Though he never sold to kids , Paul sometimes peddled drugs to pay for his habit . Paul was later horrified to discover that when P.J. was a little boy , he had sometimes secretly watched through the keyhole of the bedroom door as Paul shot up . <p> Boredom . " Not long ago I asked him to describe a typical day , " Paul recalls . " He said he and his friends would hang out in the hallway of the project entrance and start getting bored . Someone would pull out a joint or go buy one , and they would just sit there and smoke . " The Rakauskases looked into moving to a safer part of Southie but could n't get a mortgage because of Paul 's drug-related debts and his modest salary as a chemical mixer in a factory . <p> One night last January , P.J. and some friends obtained a cache of Xanax pills from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of P.J. 's purchased a bottle of vodka for the group . P.J. imbibed too many shots and downed too many pills , went home and passed out on his bed . No one noticed when he started turning blue . But when foam bubbled on his lips , his mother called an ambulance . By the time it arrived , P.J. had inhaled his own vomit and fallen into a coma . He died a few days later . <p> " P.J. was a well-liked kid who got caught up in this s  --  storm out here , " says his father , as he wipes back tears . Most days from his second-floor apartment , Paul can watch " drug deals happening outside our windows . There are kids talking about what store to hit so they could boost sell stolen goods to buy drugs that morning  --  kids with schoolbooks under their arms at the bus stop . It 's so hard to see their faces because what you 're looking at is yourself . " <p> Last year , police received more reports of aggravated assaults at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than in any housing development in the city . And O.C. had the second-highest total of burglaries , larcenies and car thefts . Welfare dependency is the rule . Roughly 85 percent of the project 's families are on public aid . <p> Drug use seems to be spreading as well . Heroin use at O.C. has become far more brazen as the drug has become more accessible . Teenagers can avoid the stigma of needle tracks on their arms by snorting heroin , available in a 10-bag " bundle " for $70 . Strung-out junkies sometimes pester residents for money . A few dealers occasionally peddle their wares in the projects ' courtyards . Meanwhile , alcoholism , fueled by a throng of local bars , continues to be a neighborhood bane . South Boston has the second-highest death rate from alcohol and drug use of any city neighborhood , topped only by a nearby area with many homeless shelters . <p> One obstacle to remedying the lower end 's problems is that many residents refuse to acknowledge them . After his son overdosed , Paul Rakauskas posted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read : " As much as we would like to be able to say drugs and alcohol were the only reasons for P.J. 's death , we can not . P.J. was killed by ambivalence , tolerance and a general ' it ca n't happen here ' attitude . " <p> Cathy Havlin had a fateful lesson that it can . A divorced mother who also spoke at the church vigil , Havlin is no naif . She brought up her four children in the Mary Ellen McCormack development for more than 20 years . She and her only son , Brian , knew the neighbors whose teenage son was beaten to death with a baseball bat outside a Southie bar . They knew that the dead youth 's younger brother later hanged himself in the family 's apartment and left a farewell note for his dead brother under the family 's Pieta statue . And Havlin and her children also knew of neighbors who died from overdoses . <p> At times , Brian struggled himself . He dropped out of high school in 10th grade , was later convicted of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brian was his own worst enemy , but he was n't a punk , " his mother recounts . " People liked him  --  he just wanted to live life and have a ball . " <p> To Havlin , the tragedies that befell her neighbors were aberrations in an otherwise safe place . For most of the past decade , Havlin handled patient accounts at Boston Medical Center , the city hospital , asking patients about their health insurance carriers and where to send their bills . She often spoke with desperate parents as they waited to see if their children would live or die from gunshot wounds . " My heart broke for these people , " Havlin says . " I never thought I would be one of them . " <p> " Shots fired . " Then last July , Havlin found herself in the waiting room at the hospital . The night before , Brian had helped a girl move out of an apartment in Mary Ellen McCormack after she complained about drug use taking place there . James Joyce , another Southie man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked a fistfight with Brian . Several hours later , according to Boston 's district attorney , Joyce stopped Brian in a courtyard of the project , shot him nine times and was bent on running over Brian 's body with his car until witnesses stopped him . ( Joyce has pleaded not guilty . ) Riding with a police officer to the hospital , Havlin listened to chatter on the scanner  --  " nine or 10 shots have been fired "  --  thinking over and over , " they ca n't be talking about Brian . " Her son died without regaining consciousness . He was 25 . <p> For all the problems in the lower end , some inner-city nightmares  --  open-air drug markets , roving youth gangs and murderous crack dealers  --  are virtually absent from the projects . As a whole , South Boston has less violent crime than many parts of the city . The homicide rate in the largely black neighborhood of Roxbury is four times that of South Boston . And the area does not suffer from housing segregation and the flight of middle-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents , most of them Irish , grow up together , go to school together , marry among themselves and put shamrocks on their friends ' gravestones . That familiarity makes the streets secure enough that elderly women are not afraid to walk their dogs late at night . <p> Yet whatever the differences between black and white slums , both liberals and conservatives argue that the emergence of a white underclass is an important , little-noticed phenomenon that proves their theories about what makes people poor . Conservatives such as Charles Murray contend that welfare programs have " lifted the economic penalties of having a child without a husband , " enabling poor whites as well as blacks to bear children out of wedlock with scant social stigma . Liberals assert that the rise of a white underclass proves that low-income whites , in addition to blacks , have been hurt by changes in the economy that the urban underclass is an old one . What 's new is that poor whites are now included . It 's unlikely that the white underclass will soon eclipse the black one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South Boston vigil can attest , living in a white slum exacts its own harsh price . It can sometimes mean dying young . <p> Poor neighborhoods , in white and black <p> White and black slums , on average , had these features in 1990 : TABLE <p> Note : White and black slums are made up of census tracts where a majority of residents are of one race or another ( and not Hispanic ) and at least 40 percent live below the poverty line . <p> Source : USN &WR;  --  Basic data : Ronald Mincy , in African American Economic Thought : Vol. 2 .
