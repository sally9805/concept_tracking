In her private journal , a teenager finds fault with her mother and pronounces her parents ' marriage a mere convenience . One entry reads , " If she had only one aspect of an understanding mother , either tenderness , or kindness , or patience or something else , I would keep trying to approach her . " Elsewhere she complains that her father does not love his wife , that he kisses her as he kisses his daughters . <P> These are not the sort of disclosures that usually stop presses . But what if the diarist was Anne Frank , the most storied victim of the Holocaust , the precocious prose stylist whose single published work has sold 25 million copies in more than 50 languages and has been required classroom reading for half a century ? <P> That , of course , is another story , one that transcends the rash jottings of a 14-year-old and creates the kind of stir that occurs when competing interests squabble over the bones of a martyr . <P> Late last month , the Swiss-based Anne Frank Fonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Frank 's writings , threatened to sue the Amsterdam newspaper Het Parool after it ran previously unpublished pages from Anne 's diary about the elder Franks ' relationship . The paper would not divulge the source of its story . But the prime suspect is Cor Suijk , a senior official at the Anne Frank Center in New York City and a source for German journalist Melissa Muller 's new and well-timed biography Anne Frank ( Metropolitan Books ; 330 pages ; $23 ) . <P> Suijk ( pronounced Sowk ) claims that he was given the five pages of unpublished entries by Anne 's father shortly before Otto Frank died in 1980 . The only member of the family to survive the war , Otto was both custodian of his daughter 's legacy , and its expurgator . The first edition of the diary was published in 1947 without including embarrassing family passages . <P> Muller , who examined the new pages but legally could only paraphrase them , says that Suijk " got the pages because Otto did n't want to destroy them . " The rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept at the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation . Suijk is hoping that a philanthropist will buy his fragments and donate them to the Institute so that he can use the proceeds to support his center in New York . <P> That Anne Frank is remembered at all can be attributed to Nazi priorities : first , round up Jews ; next , confiscate their valuables . Books and personal scribblings were optional . That is what happened on Aug. 4 , 1944 when , on a tip , SS Oberscharfuhrer Karl Josef Silberbauer and his men broke into the annex behind Otto Frank 's foodstuffs firm at 263 Prinsengracht in Amsterdam . The raiders arrested the Franks and four others who shared their secret quarters . Furniture and salable items were removed . <P> Left strewn on the floor were the green-and-red book , the journals and loose blue-and-pink sheets containing Anne 's account of two years in hiding . They were picked up and put in a desk drawer by Miep Gies , Otto 's secretary . Gies , now 89 , is an international hero for helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains unclear . However , Muller pointedly notes that there were discrepancies in the postwar testimony of a Dutch cleaning woman that were never followed up .
