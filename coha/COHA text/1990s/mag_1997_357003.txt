The biggest entertainment software convention of the year was nine days away , and John Romero still did n't have his monsters finished or his dialogue written . The computer gaming masses who descend upon Atlanta this Thursday for the third annual Electronics Entertainment Expo ( E3 ) will be lining up to test-drive the latest offering from the man who designed some of the seminal CD-ROM games of the 1990s  --  including Doom , Doom II and Quake  --  but as of last week , Romero and his team were still scrambling to get the demo done . <P> Being under the gun is nothing new to Romero . For five years , he and the other co-founders of id Software rolled out one ultraviolent shoot-'em-up game after another , in the process becoming legends in the gaming world : designer Romero for the orgiastic mayhem of his monster-filled scenarios ; artist Adrian Carmack for his dystopian , mazelike backdrops ; and programmer John Carmack ( no relation ) for game engines that create an uncanny sense of careering movement through a real three-dimensional space . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ id but against it . Last November he and id marketing whiz Mike Wilson abruptly left the company , hooked up with Tom Hall ( an id designer who had left earlier ) , moved into a Dallas skyscraper and announced the birth of a new company , ION Storm . Their first product is called Daikatana , and the E3 show this week is their best chance to spark some buzz for a Christmas ' 97 software season in which they will almost certainly go head-to-head with id 's Quake II . How to finish the demo in time ? " Get in at 2 p.m. , " says Romero , " and stay until 4 in the morning . " And repeat daily until the job is done . <P> The ability to work around the clock , along with his childhood obsession with games like Pac-Man and his Bill Gatesian decision to drop out of college to write software , are traits Romero shares with many top-notch programmers . He met Hall and the two Carmacks at a company called Soft Disk in Shreveport , La. , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ id , settling by 1992 in a Dallas suburb called Mesquite . <P> Six years later , id 's 3-D bloodfests have spawned a worldwide gaming revolution and made its founders cult heroes and multimillionaires before age 30 . Sports cars and magazine covers swiftly followed . Romero in particular wore the mantle of pop-culture godhood with aplomb . If the four founders were , as Wired magazine dubbed them last August , " The Egos at id , " then Romero , with his lion 's mane of black hair , his Tudor mansion , his Testarossa , BMW and Humvee , was the superego . <P> Why did the hottest game-development team in PC history break up faster than the Beatles ? According to Romero , it was because his vision of gaming perfection clashed with John Carmack 's vision of coding perfection and lost . Carmack saw id as a boutique company , cranking out one title a year based on his latest **30;5484;TOOLONG game engine  --  which left lead designer Romero feeling like a second-class citizen . " We were spending all this time making data for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romero says , frustration still edging his voice , " and then we 'd have to throw it all away because John decided to change something .
