Setting the Record Straight I trust that years ago , when he was an assistant district attorney , Robert G. Cahill did a more reliable job prosecuting defendants than he has done attacking me ( Letters , 5/25 , responding to George M. Anderson , S.J. , " Capital Punishment in Perspective : An Interview With Kevin Doyle , " 4/20 . See also Letters , 5/18 ) . Beginning with Cahill 's broad defense of Deep Southern capital justice , you do n't have to take my word on the issue . Ignore the fact that ardent death penalty proponent Cahill , who as a district court judge can not even hear capital trials , erred on a point of law even in his letter . ( Under Alabama law , a judge does not " overturn " the sentencing jury 's merely advisory verdict . ) Consult articles in 44 Alabama Law Review 1 ( 1992 ) , 103 Yale Law Journal 1835 ( 1994 ) , or the June 11 , 1990 National Law Journal . Then make your own judgment about the counsel system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few months ago , first , the trial court declared our client , Mr. Williams , indigent . For sure , he could have been , as Cahill charges , " worth millions . " While on death row before the 1992 grant of a retrial , Mr. Williams 's wife and daughter were killed by a drunk truck driver . A huge wrongful death judgment was there for the claiming . Mr. Williams , however , signed the money over for a conservatorship for his surviving children . Now Cahill , though an old friend of the prosecutor who twice tried to have Mr. Williams executed , did not see or hear any of Mr. Williams 's trial . ( Cahill sits about half a state away . ) Still , had he even bothered to obtain and read the trial court 's sentencing order , he would have found that Mr. Williams 's financial gesture of concern for his children-compelling evidence of which we put in the record-gave the judge cause to show mercy . Second , the notion that I " travelled the southern part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media event for myself " is a bad joke . A writer for The New Yorker magazine , with whom I never travelled , covered the trial of his own accord . And , frankly , I needed to use up vacation to try a capital case for free like I needed a hole in the head ( which my wife and three children wanted to give me for my trouble ) . Concerning my professional ability and expertise , I am far from perfect and always look to improve . Still , if I was " sloppy " at trial , it received no note by the judge and escaped co-counsel , the press , Mr. Williams and apparently the prosecutor who failed to keep out any of our evidence . Further , it was early 1991 when Cahill heard me say I had not yet actually tried a capital case in Alabama . When I left Alabama in mid-1995 that was no longer true . I spent much of my 66 months in Alabama handling capital cases at the postconviction and direct appeal levels ( i.e. , trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , I was also counsel of record on eight trial level cases . I thank the Lord that today none of these clients face death sentences and only two ended up with even capital murder convictions and thus life without parole . Apart from my own cases , I collaborated with literally dozens of lawyers all over Alabama in defending their capital clients before and during trial . Finally , that collaboration was sometimes a great pleasure . I admired and learned from several of these Alabama lawyers . Indeed , unlike Robert Cahill , who defends the status quo , I wanted to see them better trained , equipped and compensated so they could do the kind of solid job they wanted to do , the solid job fairness demands in a death case . Kevin M. Doyle New York , N. Y. Objection , Your Honor Kevin Doyle took a 75 percent pay cut to come to Alabama in 1989 . He brought to Alabama over six years ' criminal jury trial experience and years of Wall Street litigation practice to aid Alabama capital defendants and death row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I relied on Doyle 's extraordinary skills as a litigator in coordinating much of our capital trial work . Judge Cahill 's misguided and grossly misinformed attack against Kevin Doyle 's terrific work reflects the extent to which too many in this state would rather defend a bad system of justice than work toward creating a better one . Bryan Stevenson Director , Equal Justice Initiative of Alabama Montgomery , Ala Another Witness A few years ago , Kevin Doyle greatly helped me to prepare a capital case for trial . So this past winter when he was trying a case in my city , I went to watch . His motion work was painstaking and innovative . His cross-examination , especially of the pathologist , was crisp and exacting . His argument was creative and compelling . The suggestion that Doyle was " sloppy " is laughable . Kathleen M. Nemish Dothan , Ala . Rachel Crying Terry Golway 's brief and brilliant article on partial-birth abortion ( 5/25 ) is a poignant plea for united opposition to this " high-tech infanticide " that I hope every citizen will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horror and evil of such an attack on the utterly helpless newborn , if our politicians can not override his veto , and if men and women of " common sense and simple morality " fail to oppose this plague of death in our land , then a terrible , empty silence will have stifled the sobbing and loud lamentation of Rachel , who wept for her children and would not be consoled since they were no more ( Mt . 2:18 ) . Daniel Durken , O.S.B. Collegeville , Minn . A Few Flowers The editorial " New Life For Parishes " ( 5/11 ) sees a " subtle transformation in pastoral leadership , " with a generous statement of expectations for continued growth in parish life . Would that it were true . But when I also read that only 20 percent of Catholics attend weekly Mass and we see our own children in late teens and 20 's tuning out on local parish activities , I think the optimism is a bit overstated . I firmly believe that many of our current generation are neither aware nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The late Cardinal Leo Jozef Suenens was a true believer . As an old church historian of sorts , I believe that the vision of Cardinal Suenens and Vatican II should be seen as a parish blueprint that must be fostered and pursued . To believe otherwise is to get carried away by the sign of a few flowers growing in the garden and ignoring the life of grace that lies fallow in the hearts of many of the 80 percent who do not attend church regularly . Joseph J. Burns White Plains , N. Y. Proceed Gently I think your response to Rose Mary Meyer 's letter , in which she condemned purportedly sexist language ( 5/25 ) , was one of the funniest comebacks I have heard in a long time . It reminded me that I should proceed gently ( and with a sense of humor ) when taking on the enemies of truth and justice . Unconsciously we may be undermining the very things which are closest to our hearts when we attempt to straighten out others . Bob Steele Cincinnati , Ohio Real Barriers As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tone of Maurice B. Conway 's article , " For the Least of These " ( 5/18 ) . Surely Mr. Conway must know the power of language and how language conjures up positive or negative images . For example , the word " handicap " has its source in the expression " cap in hand . " The term originated in England , when soldiers who were wounded in the Crimean War were allowed to beg for charity . Consequently , a more positive and preferable term today is " people with disabilities " rather than " handicapped people . " Also words such as " palsy victim " and " afflicted " tend to be judgmental and do a disservice . Most of all , they do not reflect the real barriers faced by people with disabilities in our society , such as discrimination , inaccessibility and high rates of unemployment . Anne M. Wasserstrom Delmar , N.Y . Certainly a Believer I read Eamon Duffy 's very informative and scholarly article in The London Tablet , " Was Shakespeare a Catholic ? " to which Daniel Wackerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglected an interesting point . While in England recently , I learned from the brochure given out at Holy Trinity Anglican Church at Stratford-Upon-Avon that Shakespeare became a " lay rector " of the church in 1605 . This is why " the priviledge was bestowed on him " of being buried in the chancel of Holy Trinity , the church in which he was baptized . I do n't know if Shakespeare was truly a Catholic or an Anglican . But he certainly was a believer . In probably the last play wholely written by the dramatist , " The Tempest , " we hear Prospero in the epilogue say : " And my ending is despair Unless I be relieved by prayer , Which pierces so that it assaults Mercy itself and frees all faults . As you from crimes would pardoned be , Let your indulgence set me free . " AMERICA is an oasis in the desert where live . Keep up the good work ! ( Rev. ) Michael J.
