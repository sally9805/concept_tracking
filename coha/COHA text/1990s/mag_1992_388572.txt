Section : An FDA horror story . <p> The killer grapes are back again , the same two cyanide-tainted grapes that terrorized American consumers three years ago , swept tons of fruit off supermarket shelves , and severely damaged the Chilean economy . First perceived as an averted tragedy and then as an overreaction by the Food and Drug Administration , it now appears that the Chilean Grape Scare of 1989 was a farce . Chilean fruit growers have filed a lawsuit against the U.S. government to recover more than $330 million in damages caused by the FDA 's eleven-day embargo of the grapes . The growers claim that the suspect grapes were most likely contaminated not by terrorists in Chile , as the FDA first implied , but by the FDA itself . <p> Both sides agree on the beginning of the story . On March 2 , 1989 , an anonymous caller to the U.S. Embassy in Santiago warned that fruit headed for the United States had been injected with cyanide as an act of protest against the Pinochet regime . The call was repeated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spotted three suspicious-looking grapes on the docks at Philadelphia , in a shipment that had just arrived from Chile . Two of the grapes had puncture marks surrounded by concentric white rings ; the third grape was slashed . <p> The fruit was rushed to the FDA 's Philadelphia laboratory , where the two punctured grapes were tested and found to contain cyanide . Not much , not even enough to make a small child feel ill . But then-FDA Commissioner Frank Young decided that it was " better to be safe than sorry , " as he repeatedly put it , and the mass fruit dumping began . The FDA impounded 2 million crates at airports and docks across the country and warned consumers not to eat any fruit from Chile , which included most of the peaches , blueberries , blackberries , melons , green apples , pears , and plums that were on the market at the time . In Oregon a distraught mother sent a police car on a high-speed chase after a school bus when she suddenly remembered that she had packed some grapes in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chilean fruit from the market . Before the crisis ended eleven days later , some 20,000 Chilean food workers had lost their jobs . <p> Given those facts , it would seem that , at the worst , the FDA had erred on the side of extreme caution . In their lawsuit , however , the Chileans claim there is more to the story . At the Philadelphia laboratory , the two punctured grapes tested positive for cyanide . But while the chemists there were congratulating each other on their discovery , part of the grape sample , along with the other grapes taken from the pallet and the other packing material that had accompanied the grapes , was sent to the FDA laboratory in Cincinnati for additional tests by Dr. Fred Fricke , an FDA specialist in cyanide contaminations . Cyanide is migratory . If the two suspected grapes had been injected with cyanide , the surrounding grapes in the bunch and the box itself would likely show traces of the poison . Fricke found nothing . Using the same tests as did the chemists in Philadelphia , he found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on anything else . <p> The obvious next step was to retest the Philadelphia sample . But , as the Chileans reveal in their suit , the Philadelphia sample had been destroyed . In violation of both the Code of Federal Regulations and the FDA Regulatory Procedures Manual , which require that part of any original sample be set aside for just such a situation , the Philadelphia lab had used sodium hydroxide to neutralize the grape sample , instead of liquid nitrogen . Sodium hydroxide rendered the sample useless for further tests . <p> It was now 3:30 a.m. on March 13 . The fruit was still sitting on the dock . Young had to decide whether to accept the docked fruit or reject it , and whether or not to embargo all Chilean fruit . Based on the information Young had , the decision should have been easy . Depending on which test he believed , the grapes were found to have either no cyanide at all or not enough even to upset the stomach of a child . What 's more , well before the discovery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be impossible to poison a Chilean grape by injecting it with cyanide . They knew , because they had tried it . Noting that the anonymous caller had specifically said the fruit would be " injected " with cyanide , the FDA had attempted to poison some grapes of their own , according to documents filed with the court . Lab studies had shown that the internal pressure of the fruit pulp in grapes would force virtually all of the cyanide injected back out onto the surface of the grape . This would turn the grape black , hardly an effective poisoning technique . In fact , FDA scientists had told Young that any grape poisoned in Chile would have turned black and wrinkled during the thirteen-day sea voyage from Chile to the United States . <p> Young also knew that the box containing the suspect grapes had been loaded aboard the Almaria Star in a position that was inaccessible during the entire voyage . If the grapes had not been poisoned in Chile , and could not have been reached aboard ship , then they had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there was another fact that Young knew , should have known , or should have been told . The grapes had been exposed to cyanide in the agency 's Philadelphia lab . Cyanide is used in poison tests to calibrate the testing instruments . It is also used to " spike " the sample being tested  --  introducing a known quantity of cyanide into the sample to guard against false negative results . This was the procedure used that day in Philadelphia , which meant that the grapes most probably had been contaminated right there in the lab . <p> However , in spite of the overwhelming evidence that the fruit posed no danger , the FDA announced the embargo the next day . Young appeared on national television , urging consumers to throw away the fruit they had on hand and instructing grocers to pull it from their shelves . " We urge people not to consume the fruit they have if they are not sure of its origin , " he said . <p> Young said nothing about the possibility that the tests were in error . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cyanide had been found . The public was told only that the grapes were poisoned and that a clear danger existed . <p> Why did the FDA instigate what was essentially a scare campaign ? The agency declined to be interviewed for this story , since the case is in litigation . But the answer may be relatively simple : the FDA panicked . <p> The Chilean fruit scare came in the wake of the many other food and drug tampering incidents that the FDA faced during the ' 80s . In 1982 it was Tylenol capsules laced with cyanide . In 1984 it was fragments of glass in Gerber fruit juice products . Gerber was hit again in 1986 , as were Tylenol and Excedrin . There were dozens of other threats that never made major headlines . Some were hoaxes , some the results of faulty production ( the tiny bits of Gerber glass were part of the bottling process ) , but some were acts of terrorism that took lives and terrified consumers across the country . <p> It was the FDA that had to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled them well , issuing warnings and working closely with industry to pull products off the shelves . But within the FDA , the fear of additional cyanide poisoning became the full-time bogeyman of the upper echelons of the agency . Everybody was waiting for " the big one , " a major eruption of food or drug tampering that would hold the entire nation hostage . " I was waiting for this to happen , " Young said after the Chilean grape scare . " This was not at all a surprise . I knew that it would eventually come to a major international tampering . " The FDA was so sure , say the Chilean growers , that the fear became father to the event . <p> By Herbert Burkholz <p> <p> HERBERT BURKHOLZ is writing a book about the FDA in the 1980s <p>
