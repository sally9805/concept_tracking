<p> Washington - The federal government is planning a little surprise for you this fall and , no , it 's not the tax increase . <p> Rather , the government has decided that the cable industry owes you , the general viewing public , $ 1 billion a year , every year for the foreseeable future . It wants to start returning this money in the form of rate rollbacks , beginning Sept. 1 . <p> But whether this rollback ever occurs depends on the Federal Communications Commission , a thinly staffed agency that has been financially starved for a decade . <p> Now this reed-thin agency must shoulder one of the heaviest regulatory loads in the history of the country . Last year Congress empowered the FCC to tell cable operators how to do everything from setting rates to answering telephone complaints . <p> The question is whether an agency with fewer than 2,000 employees can control a $ 20 billion industry that reaches more than 60 percent of all households . <p> " There 's no question that we 're snowed under , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge administrative challenge , but we can handle it . " <p> Others are not so sure . The Consumer Federation of America , which supports strong checks on cable operators , believes the agency is already knuckling under to the industry and congressional opponents of cable regulation . <p> " We 're surprised and disappointed by some of Mr. Quello 's decisions , " says Bradley Stillman , the consumer federation 's legislative counsel . Mr. Quello , for example , postponed the rollback of cable rates for six months . <p> " It 's hard to tell at this point whether consumers are going to come out ahead , " says Jill Luckett , legislative director for U.S. Sen. Robert Packwood ( R-Ore. ) , a leader in the Senate on the issue of telecommunications . <p> Far-reaching act <p> At issue is the Cable Act of 1992 , which re-regulated the country 's 11,385 cable systems . The act does a lot of things , including requiring cable systems to pay the networks for broadcasting their programming signals . The act also encourages new competition against cable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies . Mr. Quello and a growing number of congressmen would like to see the phone companies enter the cable business . The entry of the telcos , as they are called on Capitol Hill , is part of the impending convergence of computers , telephones and cable technologies . Someday in the not so distant future , you 'll be able to use your television to make telephone calls , play computer games and buy merchandise . <p> Overseeing this massive technological change will be the FCC . But it 's most immediate and most important job is to lower cable rates as mandated in the act . <p> Puffing uphill <p> In trying to enforce the cable act , the FCC is not unlike the little engine that could , of children storybook fame . It 's puffing uphill and muttering , " I think I can , I think I can . " <p> But can it ? Kept small under 12 years of Republican administrations , the agency 's budget grew slowly , if at all . The staff stayed roughly the same at about 1,700 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conservative leadership of Chairman Alfred Sikes , the FCC was hell-bent on deregulating the cable industry and most of the new emerging telecommunication technologies . <p> Then came the battle to pass the cable act . For years , consumers have been complaining to congressmen and consumer advocates about high cable rates and poor service . Last year Congress finally took up the issues . What ensued was a massive battle that pitted network broadcasters against the cable industry and consumer advocates against the Republican White House . To everyone 's surprise , the act passed and even survived a veto by then President George Bush . <p> " If Jesus had a second coming to Earth , he could n't have stopped this act , " says Mr. Quello . " There were a lot of unhappy consumers . " <p> The act 's passage marked the beginning of a new era for the FCC . Republican administrations and their deregulatory mission were replaced by a Democrat , President Clinton , who supported the cable act . Mr. Sikes stepped down and was temporarily replaced by another cable act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable industry had the world by the tail and now they have been brought back to earth , " says Mr. Quello , referring to the industry 's 10 years of unregulated growth , during which it wired 40 million homes and nearly tripled its rates . <p> A 29-year veteran of the FCC , Mr. Quello is no stranger to the cable industry . Nor is he a pushover . At age 79 , he is an avid tennis player who often faces off against other agency heads and congressional leaders . <p> In the cable industry , Mr. Quello faces a tough opponent who feels deeply stung . Even the industry 's largest cable operator faces a substantial financial hit . Tele-Communications Inc. , with 10.4 million subscribers , announced last month that a rate rollback would shrink its revenue annually by $ 140 million to $ 160 million . <p> " This is an enormous revenue setback , " says Brendan Clouston , TCI 's chief operating officer . <p> Not surprisingly , the cable industry struck back hard . Led by Atlanta-based Turner Broadcasting System , cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuccessful so far , the suit is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court this fall . <p> The industry has also been resisting other portions of the act . Under the act , broadcasters can choose for the first time whether they want to be compensated for their programming , which cable systems have carried with minimal charge for nearly 30 years . Almost every major cable operator has said that it wo n't pay for any broadcast signal . <p> " Cable had a strategy from the beginning to obstruct and delay compliance , " says Jeff Baumann , the National Association of Broadcasters ' general counsel . A longtime cable rival , the NAB lobbied strongly for the act , which it felt would rein in a competitor viewed as having grown too powerful . <p> Playing hardball <p> Mr. Quello has shown the industry that he , too , can play hardball . His agency determined that the cable industry had gouged consumers by $ 1 billion a year in rate overcharges . It immediately froze rates nationwide while figuring out a way to determine a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FCC came up with a formula some 500 pages long , sending cable operators into a panic . They had to fill out five pages of complex financial information that the FCC is using to set rates . <p> The industry threatened to drown the FCC in a flood of appeals . But it dropped the idea after Mr. Quello said he would slow down the whole process , giving the industry even bigger headaches . <p> " The industry has assured me now that it will cooperate , " says Mr. Quello , smiling . <p> The FCC , however , is hardly out of the soup . It still faces what NAB counsel Mr. Baumann says is an " insurmountable task . " <p> In fact , things got so bad in June that Mr. Quello threatened to shut down the FCC for August unless Congress gave him more money and more staff . The threat worked . <p> In early July , Congress gave the agency another $ 11.5 million , which will be used to hire 240 lawyers and accountants to enforce the cable act . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FCC , " says David Leach , a congressional staffer who helped write the cable act . <p> The additional money came with a big price tag . The agency had to move up from Oct. 1 to Sept. 1 its planned rate rollback . That means even more work for the beleaguered staff . <p> Wearily shaking his silvery head , Mr. Quello points to a sign on his desk . It reads : " Nothing is impossible for those who do n't have to do it . "
