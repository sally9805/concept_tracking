The performances by American educator Thomas Sutherland and British church envoy Terry Waite as they emerged last week from years of captivity testified to the remarkable resiliency of the human spirit . Sutherland , 60 , who spent most of his 2,347 days as a hostage in Lebanon tethered by ankle chains to a wall , calmly alternated tales of senseless beatings and profound depression with lighthearted quips about Waite , who , he reported , " snores awfully loudly . " Waite , 52 , limping from his years in chains , reported , " I was kept in total and complete isolation for four years . " Yet 1,763 days in windowless cells neither dimmed his megawatt smile nor diminished his faith in mankind 's basic goodness . " I trust the Hizballah , " he said of the very people whose double-crossing cost almost five years of his life . <P> Waite was referring to his captors ' pledge to free by the end of November the three remaining American hostages , among them journalist Terry Anderson . There seemed great promise that the hostage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hizballah said the fate of the remaining Western hostages was no longer linked to freedom for 300-odd Arab prisoners held by Israel 's proxy militia in south Lebanon . An announcement by U.S. officials that Washington and Tehran were nearing agreement on payment of $275 million owed to Iran for undelivered military equipment dating back to 1979 sweetened the prospect of a resolution . Both Syria and Iran continued to speed the process along in order ( to gain access to Western economic assistance . Still , the time frame remains iffy : Tehran radio said the hostages would be home by Christmas . <P> For Sutherland , it was a bittersweet homecoming . Even as he learned that his 88-year-old father-in-law had died just two days earlier , he received word that one of his three daughters was about to give birth . Sutherland seemed forgiving of his captors , allowing , " I do n't think they really thoroughly understand what they were doing to us , putting those chains back on our legs every day . " Although he appeared healthy , the discovery of an ulcer at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's hostage ordeal ended with the return of Waite , the high-profile envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the last British captive in Lebanon . But as bells joyously tolled his freedom , the homecoming unleashed feverish speculation about the role the U.S.  --  and maybe Waite himself  --  had played in his capture . Did Waite know of Washington 's secret arms dealings ? And was he a willing agent , or an unwitting collaborator ? Before his capture , Waite denied any knowledge of the U.S. arms-for-hostages scheme . <P> While the Briton began as a globe-trotting negotiator acting for the Church of England , his efforts gradually meshed with the U.S. campaign . Waite 's ties to Lieut . Colonel Oliver North , the point man in the doomed U.S. trade-off , are well documented . Not only did the two men meet at least five times , but the U.S. provided Waite with helicopters and other assistance during some of his missions . By 1986 , the captors had intertwined Waite 's efforts with the secret U.S. operation : each time a weapons shipment was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Damascus , and North would signal Waite that the time was ripe for him to visit his contacts in Beirut . With these pieces in place , a hostage would be released and Waite could claim credit .
