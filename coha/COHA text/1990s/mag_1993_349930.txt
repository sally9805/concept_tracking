In the most desperate moments of his life , a severely burned Sumner Redstone saved himself by clinging to a window ledge with his right handand counting to 10 over and over again as flames swept through his room in a Boston hotel fire . " My legs were burned to my arteries , " he recalls . " I got to a window , and it would n't open . I got to another one and hung by my hands . It seemed like a lifetime . " Despite 60 hours of burn surgery , doctors doubted that Redstone would ever walk again . His tendons were destroyed , his little finger partly amputated . Yet 14 years later , he not only walks but plays tennis with a ferocity that unnerves his opponents . <P> That relentless will to survive and conquer has now led Redstone , 70 , the chairman of MTV-owner Viacom Inc. , to launch what could be the business coup of a lifetime . At an age when most executives are thinking country clubs and conferences , Redstone last week engineered an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share in cash and stock and thereby create one of the world 's media giants.Since Redstone would hold 70% of the voting stock of the combined company , he would have majority control of more movies , books and television shows than any other media mogul  --  unless Ted Turner , Barry Diller or one of the other rival suitors now circling the Paramount building comes forward and derails the merger ( see box ) . <P> Redstone , a rags-to-riches tycoon who is worth about $4 billion , has always sought to crush all comers  --  from rivals who might try to bust up his latest deal to weekend tennis partners . On the court he uses a special leather strap that wraps around his scarred right hand to enable him to grip the racquet . " He is the most formidable competitor I 've ever had , " says Alan Friedberg , a retired chairman of Loews Theater Management Corp . In one tennis rally , Redstone demanded to know whether his ball was in or out . " He had to know , even though we were just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It happened to be out , and I told him . He insisted it was n't . We were rallying , mind you . I was stunned . " <P> Off the court , Redstone wears nondescript suits and owns the same three- bedroom home in Newton , Massachusetts , that he and his wife Phyllis paid $42,000 for 35 years ago . He favors the less fancy Pine Brook Country Club in nearby Weston over the prestigious Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline . He spends weekdays in Manhattan 's Carlyle Hotel to be near Viacom headquarters . Often rising at 5 a.m. , he reads the morning papers and then works out on a treadmill while watching TV . His days last up to 18 hours . " I live modestly , " Redstone says . " Possessions do n't count . Achievement counts . Winning counts . " <P> Just who is this ultracombative billionaire who happens to be the grandfather of the MTV generation ?
