<p> As whites and blacks joined Hispanic youths in the recent Washington disturbances , a TV reporter observed in all seriousness that the uproar had turned into " a multicultural rioting event . " Diversity , it 's wonderful . <p> <p> The Democratic Leadership Council ( DLC ) met in Cleveland May 6 and 7 in an effort to pull a McGovernized party to the center , and to push for an electable presidential candidate . The two are related , as the DLC recognizes . The Democrats considered a number of policy proposals , some of them sensible ; some of them , indeed  --  school choice , tenant control of public housing  --  lifted from the GOP . The group faced two hurdles . One is that many Democrats would rather be pure and powerless . The Left faithful held a meeting of their own in Des Moines , and Jesse Jackson , who was not asked to address the DLC , capered about Cleveland providing photo-ops . The second problem is division within the DLC 's own ranks . The group had to back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only those who supported using force in the Gulf . That would have axed founders Sam Nunn and Dick Gephardt . ( Special note for political birders : There was a confirmed sighting of Paul Tsongas . ) <p> <p> The NBC news show Expos , living down to its name , recently ran a segment alleging that Senator Charles Robb of Virginia had been partying with a Virginia beauty queen . This salacious gossip ( which Robb denies ) served no obvious public interest , and the nearest thing to a justification that the network could produce was that it exposed hypocrisy . But how ? Even if Robb did commit adultery , he was no Jimmy Swaggart preaching sexual virtue . Any hypocrisy could only have consisted of his being married with children and apparently happily so . On this logic Robb could have escaped Exposd 's accusation only by confessing toe it . But if publicly confessing one 's private sins is to be the media 's new test of decency  --  one borrowed , incidentally , from fundamentalists  --  will it be confined to sex ? Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and telling the occasional campaign promise ? Down that road lies an intolerable dictatorship of saints enforced by spies  --  the media  --  whose slogan would be " No policemen in the bedroom  --  just interviewers . " <p> <p> WALSH WATCH : Since our last dispatch from this front , Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh has spent another $6 million or so in prosecuting the Iran-Contra case , putting his total expenses well over $40 million . If that day should ever come when Mr. Walsh relinquishes his " temporary " post , let it at least be said that here was a truly " independent " counsel : independent of any apparent financial restraints , independent of any obligation to produce results , and independent of mundane , temporal considerations like the fact that Iran-Contra is now a piece of history about which no one really gives a damn any more . <p> <p> Will environmentalists , lawyers , or Exxon do the most harm to Alaska ? Federal Judge Russel Holland and Alaska legislators were pressured into turning down the $1-billion settlement offer from Exxon for the Valdez oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds . Exxon had even agreed to plead guilty to the Justice Department 's absurd claim that the spill was the crime of hunting migratory birds without a license . Judge Holland piled on by calling the biggest environmental fine ever inadequate because it can be " absorbed " by Exxon . Some people will only be happy once oil companies become an endangered species . <p> <p> There are deficits , and then there are deficits . Paul Craig Roberts noted recently in the Wall Street Journal that Ronald Reagan 's deficits supposedly decimated America 's industrial heartland , forced interest rates up , and condemned generations of Americans to lousy jobs . George Bush 's deficits , while twice the size of Reagan 's , have had no discernible economic impact , at least judging from the comparative lack of media hysteria . In fact , the Reagan Administration used the deficit as an excuse to restrain government spending , while the Bush people use it as a pretext for higher taxes and spending . Which explains why the deficit problem has vanished so far as most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic sanctions are , contrary to NR 's advice , the accepted method for dealing with apartheid . So let the United States cease and desist from doing business in and with the state of Minnesota . According to Judge Isabel Gomez of the Hennepin County Juvenile Court there , Stephen and Janet Sharp may not adopt the little girl to whom they have been foster parents for nearly two years because she is black and they are white . This , Judge Gomez assures us , violates Minnesota 's Minority Heritage Preservation Act under which interracial adoption is prohibited . So , apparently , is U.S. press coverage and liberal outrage against apartheid when it is enacted on this continent . <p> <p> The bad news : The unprecedented severity of New York 's fiscal crisis has paralyzed budget negotiations in Albany . The good news : This paralysis is helping just about everyone . For taxpayers the failure to reach a budget agreement means a $50-million-perweek tax cut , since the governor 's plan would raise taxes by that much . The budget impasse caused interest rates on New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up $50 million worth of City notes ? The New York State public-employee pension , fund . For the time being Medicaid has ceased growing at the 17 per cent rate of recent years , state payrolls are frozen , and new issues of state debt are on hold . Unfortunately , a budget agreement sometime in June seems likely . <p> <p> After a soviet pilot downed the Korean Air Lines plane carrying 269 people in 1983 , some odd explanations were floated to demonstrate that the U.S. , after all , was really responsible . It must have been a secret American spy mission , said some  --  including military aviation experts like Victor Navasky of The Nation , Dick Gregory , Noam Chomsky , and Helen Caldicott . And anyway , the plane was warned by radio to leave Soviet airspace . When the pilot refused , what choice did the Soviets have but to take out the plane ? Now , in an extensive interview with izvestia , the pilot who downed the plane , Lieutenant-Colonel Gennadi Osipovich , says , no , there was no warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mistake it for a military plane : it was clearly a 747 . He further admits that the Soviet government instructed him to lie on each of these points  --  an ex- cuse unfortunately not available to Victor Navasky , Dick Gregory , Noam Chomsky , or Helen Caldicott . <p> <p> The 16-year civil war in Angola has now come to an end with a ceasefire agreement reached on May 1 between the Marxist regime in Luanda and Jonas Savimbi 's Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) . The accord calls for free elections in the second half of 1992 . In effect , it is a victory for UNITA and for the United States , which has backed UNITA with military aid since the misguided ban on such aid was repealed in 1985 . Savimbi will more than hold his own in a free electoral contest , which represents the kind of democratization for which he has been fighting . The Soviets and Cubans long since abandoned any hopes for military victory : the Cubans are already almost gone under an agreement reached in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose futility was assured by a determined UNITA and an equally determined United States . Mark down another success for Ronald Reagan and for the doctrine that bears his name . <p> <p> The Reverend A1 Sharpton arrived in London for a visit a few days ago and , making himself right at home , accused Queen Elizabeth of racism . That set off everyone . Even the liberal newspaper The Independent called him " the most odious man in America . " Sharpton had come to attend a memorial rally for a black youth who had been stabbed to death by white punks ; after telling the crowd that the Queen and Prime Minister John Major , among others , were bigots , Sharpton did the talk shows , and so to bed . <p> <p> Taiwan 's 42-year-long civil war with Red China formally ended May 1 , as President Lee Teng-hui terminated the long-standing " Period of Mobilization for Suppression of the Communist Rebellion . " Lee 's action , while not relinquishing the Taiwan government 's claim to be the legitimate ruler of all China , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in the improvement of relations between the two adversaries ( their " indirect " trade reached $4 billion in 1990 ) . Domestically , it nearly completes Taipei 's push for democratic reform . The nation 's first-ever free and popular elections will occur in 1992 . Maybe it 's time we in the West made a similar bow to reality by admitting Taiwan  --  the world 's 13th largest trading nation ( and the sixth largest trader with the U.S. ) - as a full-fledged member of GATT . <p> <p> Incidentally , police in Taiwan have broken up a ring of deaf-mute robbers who formed their gang and learned the necessary communication skills attending a government deaf-mute school . <p> <p> The saga of our ill-starred embassy in Moscow continues . The March 28 fire may or may not have been a windfall for the KGB , as Soviet firefighters went about unescorted for a time . ( The State Department now denies any serious security breach . ) But while our diplomats labor in a dilapidated old firetrap , competing plans to solve the problem of a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building is 65 per cent complete , but has remained unoccupied since it was found in 1985 to be riddled with KGB bugs . The State Department has come up with a plan ( nicknamed " Top Hat " ) to make the building useable : demolish the top two floors and add four new floors , all built securely by U.S. workers with U.S. materials . The House Foreign Affairs Committee approved the plan . Now , the Senate Appropriations Committee has rejected it , saying it 's not secure enough . We seem to be acting on the principle : When in Moscow ... <p> <p> A special committee of the Presbyterian Church ( U.S.A. ) formed to re-examine church teaching on sexuality has specifically endorsed homosexual ministers , teen sex , and the erotic generally . The authors claimed their proposals were prompted by declining church membership . But surely this is too roundabout a method of solving the problem . <p> <p> Eighty-five per cent of those questioned in a British poll called themselves Christian , but 34 per cent did n't know what happened on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened Easter Sunday , and 50 per cent did n't have a ghost of an idea ( holy or otherwise ) that what happened happened in Jerusalem . Maybe the British are the first post-Christian Christians . <p> <p> Meanwhile , a new book purporting to reveal " the true soul of modern America " reports that 90 per cent of us say we " truly believe in God . " But to judge by other findings in The Day America Told the Truth , by James Paterson and Peter Kim , there is some confusion about what He expects of us . Of five thousand people polled in strict confidentiality , 91 per cent admitted they lie regularly to their friends and spouses . Sixteen per cent said they would kill their spouse for a sufficient sum of money ; another 7 per cent said if the price were right they 'd murder a stranger . And so on , all leaving the impression , as a British paper put it , of " a cynical and selfcentered country . " No doubt an overstatement ; truly modest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poll . But we now know that for a sufficient sum of money , at least two Americans will assemble a book of titillating interest to the statistically curious , but useless and even discouraging to the morally serious . <p> <p> Madonna 's new movie , Madonna : Truth or Dare , will be reviewed in NR in due course , but one preliminary thing can be said : the woman is a great entrepreneur . She attracts notoriety and cash like a magnet . Much is being written and said about her remarkable candor and self-revelation in this movie . We judge her " revelations , " however , to be put-ons designed to appeal to prole-cult . She simulates masturbation and picks her nose . Heroic defiance of something or other . If you want to impress us , young lady , shake a legato . <p> <p> Congratulations to The New Republic on winning the National Magazine Award for general excellence in its circulation category ( under 100,000 , which is why we can afford to be magnanimous ) . In accepting the award , publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful to the promise of founding editor Herbert Croly to light explosives under the tables of the policy elite . " But , like woman 's work , editor 's work is never done , and the Washington Post account of the event pointed out a table that could use its charge of dynamite : at the dinner the night before , the assembled editors " were treated to eighty pre-meal minutes of New York Governor Mario Cuomo 's unhappiness with the state of the union . " <p> <p> Federal bird-feather police swooped down on a small boy who had picked up feathers in his back yard for his science-fair project , confiscating the collection and reducing the boy to tears . <p> <p> In case you missed it , Senator Robert Byrd has managed to deliver in one year the billion dollars in porkbarrel spending he promised to bring to West Virginia in six if the good people re-elected him last fall . Ah , for the days when campaign promises were forgotten . . . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
