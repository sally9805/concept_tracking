<p> As tens of thousands of pilgrims gather today at a small farm near Conyers to hear Nancy Fowler relay the latest messages she says she receives from the Virgin Mary , for the first time conflicting views are emerging publicly over her claim . <p> Three former associates of Mrs. Fowler paint a picture of her that is in sharp contrast to the image of the pious visionary who speaks to the multitudes from the farmhouse porch . Once the crowds leave , these former associates say , the 45-year-old Mrs. Fowler is subject to mood swings ranging from petulance to anger to depression . <p> Also , they said , Mrs. Fowler has seemed at times to be obsessed with the presence of demons ; and she often has expressed a desire to be a nun , even though she is married . <p> While the crowds pray the rosary today in the farm field , a team of researchers inside the room where Mrs. Fowler says she experiences the monthly apparition will perform tests on her that they hope will shed more light on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show , however , the three former associates of Mrs. Fowler doubt her claims , based on their observations of her attitudes , behavior and statements . <p> All three former associates - sought out by The Atlanta Journal- Constitution - were hesitant about discussing the inner workings of a ministry they were part of and the private life of a woman whom so many people have placed their faith in : <p> Ann Wall , who was Mrs. Fowler 's personal secretary for four months in late 1991 , said Mrs. Fowler was subject to erratic mood swings , ranging from periods of depression when she would lock herself in the basement and cry for hours , to tantrums often directed at her family . Also , Ms. Wall said , sometimes when a person had done something to anger her , Mrs. Fowler would threaten to call down angels to destroy them . <p> Martha Fernandez-Sardina , a novice in an Ohio convent who agreed to assist with Mrs. Fowler 's ministry , served as a Spanish translator and traveling companion to Mrs. Fowler for about three months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixation with demons also seen by Ms. Wall , and a preoccupation by Mrs. Fowler with having others accept the validity of her apparition claims . <p> Kuwon Kim , who was a volunteer worker with the apparition group in 1991 , and Ms. Wall both said some monthly messages read to the crowds actually were prepared in advance , from purported apparitions received by Mrs. Fowler a day or two before the event . <p> ' I choose not to defend myself ' <p> All three former associates said Mrs. Fowler frequently expressed a desire to live as a nun . They said they doubt that any true visionary would seek a lifestyle that , in Mrs. Fowler 's case , would be in direct conflict with her marriage vows . <p> Mrs. Fowler , asked last week to respond to these issues , said : " I choose not to defend myself . Let my critics say what they will . I 'll pray for them . " <p> However , her husband , Ronald J. Fowler , said he does not consider his wife to be emotionally unstable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe than others , he said . <p> He added that he believes his wife is actually communicating with Mary and Jesus . <p> " I 've seen too many good things happen to too many people , " he said , referring to spiritual benefits cited by apparition pilgrims . He said he became convinced his wife 's visions were real when he smelled roses during one of her apparitions , after she told him he would receive this as a sign . <p> A side pilgrims did n't see <p> Ms. Wall said she first met Mrs. Fowler when she spoke to a church group in North Carolina in the summer of 1991 . She said she felt called to assist in Mrs. Fowler 's ministry , so she went to Conyers . <p> For the next four months , Ms. Wall kept Mrs. Fowler 's schedule , controlled who could see her , and helped with the care of Mrs. Fowler 's two sons . <p> Ms. Wall said she saw a side of Mrs. Fowler that the pilgrims did not see . <p> Mrs. Fowler 's behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " three days of darkness " forecast in the Book of Revelation , going through a dozen or more outfits in preparation for a television interview and insisting that the clothes be ironed and re- ironed , Ms. Wall said . <p> Mrs. Fowler claimed several times that the Virgin Mary had told her that she ( Mrs. Fowler ) was supposed to be a nun , Ms. Wall said . <p> Ms. Kim noted , " She said Mary told her she was not gifted for married life or to take care of children . " That seemed a strange message from Mary , who is held by the church to be the model of motherhood , she said . <p> A disillusioned follower <p> Mrs. Fowler moved toward adopting a nun 's lifestyle , Ms. Wall said , by sleeping in a room apart from her husband . " I 'm just for the pilgrims , " Mrs. Fowler once told her , she said . <p> Mr. Fowler said he has heard his wife express a desire to become a nun only once and that was many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his wife had separate bedrooms . <p> After four months as part of Mrs. Fowler 's group , Ms. Wall said she became disillusioned and left . She said Mrs. Fowler became vindictive toward her and accused her of stealing silverware and cookware and of having an affair with Mr. Fowler . She denied the allegations . <p> Ms. Kim said she had doubts when the messages from Mary to Mrs. Fowler included some " silly " details , such as a warning for Mrs. Fowler to stay away from soft drinks and a piece of advice that Mrs. Fowler should get a kneeler for her times at prayer in the apparition room . <p> When asked to respond to the issues raised by the three former associates , Mr. Fowler said he could only speculate that the three were either jealous of Mrs. Fowler or they might have come to her under false pretenses . <p> A researcher and a believer <p> When Mrs. Fowler undergoes tests during the apparition time today , one of those who will be in the apparition room with her is Dr. Ricardo Castanon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bolivia . <p> Dr. Castanon said he had been an atheist for the past 20 years , until he met Mrs. Fowler last year . During her visit to La Paz , Dr. Castanon was among a group of scientists and academicians who examined her . <p> Examinations by a clinical psychologist show no evidence of pathological personality in Mrs. Fowler , he said . An EMG ( muscular stress ) test showed Mrs. Fowler changed almost instantly from a stressed to a highly relaxed state when she began to pray ; and Dr. Castanon said a typical patient of his might take months to make such a change . <p> Also , an EEG ( brain-wave test ) was administered to her , and when she was asked to envision heavenly beings , the test charts " went crazy , " Dr. Castanon said . <p> Dr. Castanon recalled when Mrs. Fowler said she was experiencing an apparition , he and the others in the testing group saw a light glowing around a statue of Mary in the room . <p> " It changed my life , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together by Dr. Castanon - from the United States and other countries - will participate in the testing , he said . Most of them have no experience with the apparitions at Conyers , and a subgroup of the team will review and critique the findings of the researchers to ensure that the tests are objective and scientifically valid . <p> The tests will include EEGs to measure Mrs. Fowler 's brain-wave patterns before and during the purported apparition , magnetic-force measurements to determine if there are significant changes in the energy forces in the apparition room , and a machine that emits beams of infrared light , which might detect presences that the human eye can not , Dr. Castanon said . <p> Testimonials sought <p> For months , visitors to the apparition events have been asked to leave testimonials of healing or supernatural signs that they experienced at the Conyers site . <p> Ann Marie Hancock , a former Richmond , Va. , television journalist and talk-show host , has followed up on some of those testimonials and included them in a book she has written about the Conyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take My Heart , Take My Hand . " <p> Mrs. Hancock had written a book about the apparitions in Medjugore , Bosnia ; and , initially , she was skeptical that similar apparitions might be occurring in Conyers . <p> In December 1992 she came to Conyers and spent time with Mrs. Fowler . One evening , she and five other women went outside Mrs. Fowler 's home to pray together . <p> As they prayed , Mrs. Hancock said , the area where they stood was bathed in a gold light , and the setting sun started spinning in the sky , with shafts of different-colored light emanating from it . Her account of this event was confirmed by another woman in the group , Carole Bradford , a Sandy Springs homemaker . <p> Book focuses on healings <p> Convinced that something extraordinary was happening , Mrs. Hancock spent the next five months contacting pilgrims who had left testimonials . <p> Her book , to be released this month , will include about 20 case studies of people who claim to have experienced healings at the apparition site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the claims , she said . <p> In one of the cases , a Louisiana woman named Margaret Laurent states that a malignant tumor on her eye essentially disappeared after she came to Conyers . She added that she was undergoing radiation treatment for the tumor at the time . <p> Her oncologist sent her a letter confirming that her improvement could be described as a " miraculous " cure . <p> An associate of the doctor 's confirmed his conclusions in a recent phone interview . The radiation treatment had been given a low chance of success in Mrs. Laurent 's case , the associate said .
