Tomorrow is Toussaint in Paris , All Saint 's Day , and I suppose I 'll visit Brice 's little white marble plaque in the columbarium at Pere Lachaise . Why do I avoid it for months on end ? <p> I keep thinking of a couple of Americans we met during the year before Brice died . One of them , Thomas , was a heavy , stoop-shouldered man like me , and like me he had a barrel chest that descended directly into a barrel waist . Unlike me he still wore <p> mustache , which was gray and so thick it covered his upper lip . His hair he treated like an accessory he despised and he batted at it with his hand or slapped it impatiently away from his brow . <p> His lover , Giles Satsumi , was a Japanese-American lawyer in his thirties who no longer practiced . He 'd been brought up in San Francisco and had known two of my friends who 'd migrated there from New York in the early eighties and died in the first three years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lyrics to Noel Coward 's and Cole Porter 's songs . He kept nodding other people into agreement . He never spoke about himself and seemed more intent on understanding whatever was light and amusing about his guests than in confiding his darker secrets or eliciting theirs . <p> Tom was from an old New England family that had made a small but necessary military item . He apparently had a large enough fortune to finance a life of decorous leisure . But , since they were Americans , Tom and Giles felt the need to improve themselves even if in rather disjointed and ultimately useless ways . They studied cooking at the Cordon Bleu in Paris . They 'd toured gardens as far apart as Vancouver , Sissinghurst , Nara , and Florence . Giles had also spent months in Japan learning the tea ceremony and buying fabulously expensive cracked and mended pots and exquisitely crude Korean cups . They 'd purchased a little house in the eighth arrondissement in Paris that for them was just a bagatelle , since they rarely lived there . <p> " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rat-a-tat way that made everyone laugh but that did not coerce laugher , " we 're so naive , Tom and I , at least about certain things , that when we bought this house we could n't fathom why any residence would have eight bedrooms , each with a bidet , and no kitchen , until our French friends , stifling their eclats de rire , explained to us we 'd just bought a bordello " That one French expression , with its double r , so tricky for American uvulas , was so perfectly produced that I remembered they 'd also studied French diction with a private instructor . <p> In honor of this bonbonniere from the turn of the century with its fake Greek statues of laughing girls in shorty peplums and slipping togas , its slender Ionic columns in the tiny salon that appeared to be made of lightly licked spun sugar , and its courtyard fountain of a verdigrised Pan leering over his pipes while a drunken naiad embraced his hooves , Tom and Giles had covered their windows with crackling yellow satin curtains and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything looked as though it had just been pulled out of a dress shop box and flung with prodigal abandon over a bed . I could imagine a cocotte in an ice-blue peignoir trimmed in coffee lace smoking a cigarette in the salon and listening to a wind-up Victrola playing a recording of Mistinguette . The bathroom upstairs was royal , intended more for the piquant display of pink female flesh to special customers than for routine hygiene . <p> We ate a " gourmet " dinner and I remembered to keep up a constant stream of oohs and ahs and compliments , which sounded so exaggerated to Brice that he raised an eyebrow and suspected me of mockery until I explained to him later that Americans do n't mock each other , at least not with such subtle cruelty , and that among Americans praise any less dithyrambic would have struck our host as poorly concealed disappointment . <p> After dinner , Giles asked if we 'd like to participate in a tea ceremony . Brice had just recovered from a bout of wasting brought on by a bacterium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was miraculous he was still thin and weak . <p> " How long does it last ? " I asked . <p> " About an hour . " <p> " And we 're seated cross-legged on tatami mats the whole time ? " <p> " On tatami , but most Westerners lounge about or even lie down . " <p> " But I want to do it , " Brice said . " I 'm sure it 's very spiritual and beautiful . The problem with dying for an atheist is that there are no normal spiritual occasions ; exotic ones  --  or improvised moments  --  are made to bear a heavy weight . <p> Giles nodded and left the room . Tom woof-woofed a bit like a faithful family dog . He was companionable and heartbreakingly kind but he seemed a bit lost without his brilliant companion , so decisive , so magnetic , so full of amusing ideas . <p> After ten minutes Tom led us into the courtyard , where we were supposed to remain silent and drink sips of water from the fountain ( this absurd fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom said , " We 're purifying ourselves from the dust of the outside world . Our thoughts must settle I worried that Brice , so fragile and bony , might catch cold despite his many layers of shirts , sweaters , and vests , but I could see he was concentrating and participating in everything with great seriousness . <p> We went into a narrow but high room ( one of the many chambres d'assignation ? ) that was carpeted with tatami on platforms around a recessed fire and bubbling cauldron of hot water . Giles was outfitted in elaborate robes of many layers , the outermost of black silk . His shoulders were motionless somewhere under the stiff peaks . Wearing a glossy round black hat and a sort of brocaded apron , he seemed a cross between a Shinto priest and a Masonic Grand Master . He was easygoing and quick to explain things and laughed at passing awkwardnesses , but nevertheless the room , the costume , and the singing of the kettle made him seem more subdued . <p> Brice was panting slightly , no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hipbones that looked as huge as an old nag 's when he was naked and the bulb at the base of his spine where the coccyx had worn red and become inflamed . But his eyes were sparkling with the excitement . <p> Tom , in stocking feet and trousers , big belly hanging over his belt , scooted about on his knees , the grave , mustachioed acolyte serving the young priest and presenting us , the communicants , first with small , beautiful , and nearly tasteless rice cakes and , after the elaborate brewing and whisking , the foamy , bitter green tea . Giles explained everything he was doing . He showed us the ancient elements of the tea service . He explained the painting on the wall . He demonstrated the method for receiving the cup and turning it a hundred and eighty degrees away in order to drink modestly from the inferior side and to present the superior side , with a bow , to the next drinker . We examined the black lacquered caddy and the bright green dry tea piled high inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tea the bowls were rinsed and dried with a smart swipe of a folded towel . " Now you 're allowed to handle the bowls and look at them from every angle , since often a visitor might see a particular bowl only once in his lifetime <p> could see that Brice was sweating from the effort to stay seated this way but that he was charmed by such a fussy ritual combining spirituality and connoisseurship . <p> Nine months later , on New Year 's , just three months before Brice was to die , we were invited back , this time with Brice 's brother Michel , a big , strapping weight lifter from Nice who , despite his bulging muscles , was every bit as much an aesthete as Brice himself . Since he was shy and in any event spoke no English , he was very quiet , but he , too , marveled at the refinement of the ceremony , conducted so improbably in this Belle Epoque maison de passe . The elements of the tea service were all decorated this time with silver and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good luck , appropriate to a New Year 's tea . Giles was extremely attentive to Brice , who was now ectoplasmically thin ; his cheekbones looked as though they 'd burst through the translucent yellow parchment of his skin . And yet Giles was driven to complete this dolorous if inspiring ritual in the most exacting manner . <p> Brice died and I received a condolence note from Giles and Tom . Six months later , Tom sent me a black-bordered printed Bristol announcing Giles 's death . I called our only mutual friend , who told me that Giles had been ill for years , but able to travel , cook , garden , make tea . When his health suddenly took a turn for the worse at the end of the summer , he 'd refused all medication and faded in two weeks . Tom , his passionately devoted lover , had vanished , inconsolable . No one knew where he was . It seemed strange to me that Giles had never spoken of his own status and that of the five participants in the New Year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
