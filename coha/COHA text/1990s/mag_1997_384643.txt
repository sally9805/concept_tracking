THE USUAL SUGGESTION for a golfer struggling to groove a steady putting stroke is to take the arms out of the stroke by switching to a long putter . It works for some , but others may find the extra-long flatstick unwieldy . If you ca n't get comfortable with it , do n't be quick to eliminate the arms . Many power hitters have long arms that putt best by hanging loosely from the shoulders with little or no bend at the elbow . Unfortunately , with a standard-length putter , keeping the arms straight usually means standing straight up , which makes it difficult to see the line of the putt . The solution may be a putter significantly shorter than normal , such as 32 inches ( standard length is 35 to 36 inches ) . You 'll be able to crouch slightly at address , positioning your eyes directly over the ball , with your arms hanging straight down from the shoulders . This stance encourages a natural pendulum action as your arms swing freely with the rocking of the shoulders . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip down to the exposed shaft of your regular-length putter and accomplish the same thing . But gripping down has its drawbacks : 1 ) Rather than holding a real grip , you 're holding metal or metal wrapped with tape ; 2 ) The grip you 're not using can throw off the balance of the club , which is designed to be used at its full length ; 3 ) Gripping down gives you an easy out : If it does n't work right away , you 'll be tempted to switch back to your standard stroke . A few manufacturers now offer putters as short as 32 inches . Spend some time on the practice green with one of these shorter putters ; it may be just the fix your stroke needs . Do n't be Afraid to be Flexible ONE MYTH of clubfitting is that better players always use stiff shafts . Now consider the following fact : Most golfers use shafts that are too stiff for their swings , and there are no hard-and-fast rules to clubfitting . You should play what works . Low handicappers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better . Although you may feel less control on really hard swings , flexible shafts allow you to throttle back to about 85 percent and still hit the ball a long way . ( This occurs because the softer shaft has a tremendous amount of whip through the hitting zone . ) And swinging easier will improve your game : Besides achieving more solid contact , you 'll tire less quickly and have more energy in reserve for the crucial closing holes . Easier swings also enhance your tempo and feel , which will carry over to the short game and on the green , as well . If you prefer making gorilla-like swings , softer shafts probably are n't for you . Your direction control , for instance , may suffer . But if consistency and tempo are the keys to your game , try being a bit more flexible . // keeping one 's arms straight with a standardlength putter usually means standing upright . // A shorter putter will allow you to crouch slightly at address . // your arms hanging straight down from your shoulders encourages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hit at about 85% and still hit the ball a long way . // <p>
