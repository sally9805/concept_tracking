RING ! HELLO ? ARGH ! YOU 'VE missed the final seconds of an N.F.L. play-off game to answer the phone only to hear a recorded voice pitching some product you do n't want . Why , there ought to be a law . . . ! <P> Actually there is . The Telephone Consumer Protection Act , which restricts telephone solicitation , went into effect Dec. 20 , and is already being challenged . Kathryn Moser , who runs a chimney-sweeping business in Keizer , Oregon , says the law hurts her marketing , and got U.S. District Judge James A. Redden to issue a preliminary injunction on the part of the law that deals with prerecorded phone solicitations . The injunction applies nationwide , and the Federal Communications Commission will probably contest it in court .
