COMPANIES CA N'T GET AWAY WITH RACISM AS USUAL ANYMORE AS AFRICAN-AMERICAN EMPLOYEES TAKE THEIR GRIEVANCES TO COURT . TO PUT IT ANOTHER WAY , THE JELLY BEANS ARE BITING BACK Photograph // Wearilg a smartly tailored red blazer ; a crisp white shirt , a black skirt and sensible black pumps , her hair meticulously styled in thin medium-length twists , Bari-Ellen Roberts ( left ) is a perfect cover model for a glossy company brochure on employee diversity . She not only looks the part of the savvy corporate executive but she also has strong credentials to back her up . During her 20-year career in banking , Roberts , Aa , worked her way up the ranks at Harris Trust and Savings and Continental Bank , two of Chicago 's largest banks , and then moved to less York City 's Chase Manhattan , where she was eventually made vice-president and manager in the large division handling corporate pcllsiolls . From day one , stuff started happening . White males would silently march by her much-coveted office with a window , stop , look and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was there for the duration or just passing through . One finally spoke up , asking if she was an outside auditor : " I told him no and that the name on the door was mine . " Some comments were less benign . " You have the job I was in line to get , " another passerby told her . " Do n't be mad at me , " she responded . " If you think you should have this job , go talk to the people who hired me . " Roberts soon became convinced she was working with a bunch of " Neanderthals and dinosaurs . " She was unintentionally breaking rules left and right . She asked questions at meetings . Her manager warned her she was moving around too much and was too visible . After a lunch meeting with the vice-president of human resources and two other recently recruited Black professionals , she was asked how the company was doing . Her response was a carefully prepared presentation showing ways other large companies demonstrate commitment to diversity . Big mistake . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands onto his desk , " she says . " He accused us of being militant . The next thing I know you 'll have Black Panthers in the halls of Texaco , ' he told us . " The situation was getting ugly . On her third performance evaluation she was initially given an S as in " strong " and " promotable . " The next thing she knew , it was scratched out and downgraded to a G as in just " good . " The reason ? Management thought she was " uppity , " her manager explained . She should stay in her office and keep a low profile . A top executive later called.her " a smart-mouth colored girl . " By now she was taking notes , recording each and every incident in a journal . " I started thinking , Look , girlfriend , this is not going to fly . You can do one of three things : You can sit here and take this and become like some of these other people-just happy to be here . You can leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney and for nearly a year wrestled with the decision about what to do . Then Texaco forced her hand . When her manager left , Roberts , who by now had established herself as a strong team leader , was next in line for his position . But when her division 's director finally announced that someone from elsewhere in the company would head the department , Roberts 's colleagues were stunned . One spoke up , pointing out that the person they were bringing in lacked her extensive experience with banks and investments . The director 's response : aI guess Bari will just have to help train him . " That did it . " That was my worst day at Texaco , " she remembers . " I was so humiliated , so angry , so defiled . " She went back to her office , telephoned her attorney and gave him clear instructions : " File the suit tomorrow . " The upshot of that suit , Roberts v. Texaco , made legal history and triggered yet another agonizing debate on racism in America . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along at a snail 's pace through the long investigation process , when those infamous " black jelly bean " tapes surfaced . On the tapes you could hear the top brass hatching plans to destroy files that could be helpful to the plaintiffs ' case and referring to the company 's " black jelly bean " employees " at the bottom of the bag . " The company 's stock value plummeted briefly amid threats of a boycott of Texaco gas stations . In a matter of days , the country 's eleventh-largest company was brought to its knees and agreed to a $176 million legal settlement , the largest ever in a corporate race-discrimination suit . The civil-rights struggle is n't over-it has simply changed front lines , from Woolworth lunch counters , public bus and school systems and state-run universities to inside the workplace . The Texaco case grabbed the biggest headlines , but throughout corporate America , African-American employees-with Black women often in the lead-who are fed up with on-the-job racism are suing the boss , sometimes winning major victories . They 're hitting companies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are some of the biggest and best-known companies in America , wellrespected household names . You buy their goods and use their services . The money you 've set aside for your pension may be invested in some of their stock . For instance ( at this printing ) : Within a couple of weeks of the Texaco settlement , two African-American women employed by Circuit City , one of the country 's largest consumer-electronics retailers , were awarded a total of nearly $300,000 after a jury agreed with their charges that they were denied promotions because of their race . Photograph // Last summer the U.S. Department of Labor filed a complaint against NationsBank Corp. , alleging that the Charlotte , North Carolina , company discriminated against 1,500 qualified applicants of color for entry-level clerical jobs . The Labor Department says that " we could n't find any nondiscriminatory reason for their not being hired . " The company , which is required to comply with federal nondiscrimination laws , counters that it has demonstrated a commitment to diversity and that it is illegal for the Labor Department to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead counsel on the Texaco case , ten Black employees are suing National Car Rental System , charging that the company " overtly fosters a corporate culture of discrimination " and that racial discrimination at the Minneapolis-based agency is " severe and pervasive . " A spokeswoman for National expressed surprise about the suit , " considering that 93 percent of our employees in South Florida are either Black or Hispanic . " R.R. Donnelley &; Sons Co. , the Chicago printing giant , is being accused of race bias after it closed a plant and laid off a disproportionate number of Blacks , many of them veterans nearing retirement . A company spokesman says management believes the suit is without merit . Meanwhile , Black employees at Shell , Coastal and Pennzoil oil companies are taking legal action , calling attention to what some people allege is the industry 's historic pattern of racism . " Racial discrimination in the oil patches is rampant , " says Larkin C. Eakin , Jr. , a Houston attorney representing Black employees at Coastal and Pennzoil . That 's just for starters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( EEOC ) received more than 26,000 complaints of race discrimination . Many people say we have n't seen anything yet . Corporate downsizing and restructuring have only heightened White-male anxieties about job security and competition from Blacks . But these days they 're putting the squeeze on the kind of AfricanAmericans who refuse to grin and bear it . " We have a young generation now moving up within the ranks of corporate America who were n't socialized to be tolerant of discriminatory behavior , " says Dr. Maria Root , a University of Washington professor and clinical psychologist who has been an expert witness in more than a dozen race-discrimination cases . " These are children of the Civil Rights Movement and they are n't going to put up with this . " That description fits record executive Lisa Cortes to a T. The 35-year-old Yale graduate is suing PolyGram Records after they closed down Loose Cannon , the record division they asked her to create and head , which featured Jamaican dancehall singer Buju Banton and other artists . The industry has long depended on Black talent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have long been mostly White guys . Cortes wants to challenge business as usual . " This is not Lisa against PolyGram , " she insists . " There 's nothing personal here . This is part of our political agenda . " She says that during her two-year stint at Loose Cannon , she was treated poorly compared with the company 's 80 other division heads , all of them White men except for one AfricanAmerican male . She alleges she was denied the access and support accorded others on her level and was often not told about important meetings and social events she needed to attend . Her immediate supervisor failed to respond to her requests for meetings . During her time as division head , she met with him only once . At one point a company exec told her the treatment she was receiving was CONTINUED ON PAGE 156 comparable to " a rape . " Her talent and skills were never an issue , she says . She was told that her division had to be dismantled because it just did n't fit into the corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesperson , " The Loose Cannon imprint consistently performed under expectations , though it was supported with extensive financial and managerial resources . " Photograph // Cortes also says she was promised that a press release would go out announcing the change-a polite send-off routinely given top-level executives leaving the company in good standing . When her release never materialized , she went public , sending out a couple of thousand letters to people in the industry . She also went to an attorney . " She tried to discourage me , " she says about that first visit . " She wanted to see how committed I was to the struggle . She made me go home and write down every incident where I was treated differently from my peers . As I started writing and writing , I saw that it was n't just me . Just because bathrooms do n't say Colored and White does n't mean these discriminatory behaviors have stopped . " None of this comes as a shock to any Black woman or man who has ever tried to develop a career path or solid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to groups like the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility ( ICCR ) , a New York City consortium of the country 's major religious investors . The group uses its considerable shareholder clout-collectively they have a portfolio valued at $70 billion-to press corporations to improve their equalemployment opportunity and affirmative-action programs and diversify their top management and boards of directors . " There was nothing going on in corporate America in the forties and fifties that is n't still going on today , " insists Gary Brouse , the group 's director of equality , diversity and indigenous issues . " Am I being harsh ? No . The situation is really bad . " Brouse adds that the larger society 's response to bias complaints is the same as always : shock , disbelief or turning the complaints inside out and blaming the victim . " That 's similar to what was going on during the Civil Rights Movement , " he adds . " It was n't until TV came about that the public actually started believing other people could do these things . This society is not ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and have physical evidence . " The barriers go up at the front door . Job applications are sometimes coded according to race and gender . Once hired , you may be tracked into divisions that may pay relatively well but do n't lead to the top . " Anything that has a relations in it-community relations , public relations , government relations , human relations-tends to have a woman or a minority vice-president , " says Rene A. Redwood , executive director of Americans for a Fair Chance ; a consortium of the six leading civil-rights legal-defense organizations , and executive director of the now-defunct Presidential Federal Glass Ceiling Commission . " Not that there 's anything wrong with these positions , but people get trapped into these jobs and do n't get a broad view of the organization . " At some companies it 's plain old South African-style apartheid . The complaint filed by plaintiffs in the case against Coastal Oil outlines a pattern of confining Black employees-even those with years of experience and stellar jobperformance evaluations-to low-level positions , paying them less than Whites with fewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignoring their complaints when coworkers or supervisors subjected them to racial taunts . Employees who attempted to assert their legal rights risked retaliation . Their responsibilities were reduced or they were simply fired . There 's also the old-boy network , which creates a corporate culture and mind-set that can keep even the best and brightest African-American woman on the outside looking in . No matter how well you walk the walk and talk the talk , your fundamental packaging does n't change , and it 's your fundamental packaging that can make others uncomfortable . " A certain segment of the White-male population feels it is their inherent right to behave in particular ways , " says LaGretta Bjorn , a program director of the ICCR . " Black women , by our very presence , call into question those long-held assumptions about their very way of being . Everything about who they are and what they represent , their lifestyle outside the walls of the corporate structure , is often challenged when a Black woman is in the same space . Nobody wants to go through that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle . " White men , who hold all the power , can at some point embrace other men including Black men for their maleness , " she adds . " And of course there 's a certain level of acceptance of White women , out of a sense of protection . But there 's nothing in the corporate context that automatically connects them to Black women . " Whether the racism is subtle or in your face , being subjected to it is the emotional equivalent of being socked with a wrenching blow to the gut . If you 're at a point where your only options are to either get out of Dodge fast or take legal action , you 've probably already suffered considerable emotional anguish , if not physical damage . " We 're not talking about a one-time incident , but systematic discrimination that goes on over time , " says Root . " After a while your confidence in yourself goes down and you feel emotionally and physically drained . People who decide to sue their employers are usually strong people . But because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become paranoid . They have a vigilance and hyperalertness to destructive actions being directed their way . Your personhood is defiled ; you have selfdoubts . Over time , discrimination rewrites a person 's character so that they do n't even know themselves . " That 's pretty much what happened to Larry Lucas , a now-retired Seattle-area salesman for a national department store who sued the company he 'd been with for 27 years . ( The name of the company is withheld here , while Lucas 's suit is in appeal . ) When he first complained to management about racist slurs directed at him or the company 's Black customers by a fellow salesman , they would often intervene and keep the bigot in check . But Lucas remembers that in 1989 new managers came in and were less sympathetic to his complaints . " They would n't do anything , " he recalls . " When I would complain , their answer would be If you do n't like it , go work elsewhere . ' " Root , who served as an expert witness in Lucas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisively in response to an employee 's legitimate complaints of harassment , they in effect become an accomplice to the crime . " If management does n't step in , it 's collusion , " she explains , " which gives further impetus to the perpetrator . " In Lucas 's case , that is exactly what happened . The hostilities soon escalated into death threats : " He talked about the Klan and militia groups coming to get me . " Lucas , now 60 , says he stayed with the company because he had a family to support . He also considered himself a valued employee . aI was among the top five in sales every month , and I was determined not to let another employee force me to quit . " For Lucas the final straw came in 1991 . Incidents were happening on an almost daily basis . He would park his car in a different space every day because his coworker had threatened to firebomb it . Lucas again complained , and this time management responded that if he complained once more he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and broke down and cried , " Lucas says . Meanwhile , the years of absorbing it all were taking their toll . He began having panic attacks and suffering from insomnia . He never let on to his family what was happening , and it strained his marriage and social relationships . His blood pressure escalated to stroke levels and he had to go on medication . " After a while , I did n't want to go anywhere , and I would n't participate in social events . I could be driving down the freeway and would start crying . I did n't know when I would lose my composure . " Upon doctor 's orders he took a medical leave from the company . His job was beginning to kill him . The jury verdict led to one of the state 's largest awards for race discrimination . But for Lucas , it 's only a partial victory . " It was a relief that somebody had recognized what I had been through , " he says . " Finally someone agreed I had been wronged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer . The company immediately appealed the court decision . Meanwhile , the colleague who psychologically tortured him for years is still on the job . " What angers me is that after three White employees testified that this guy was unbearable , he 's still at the store . The company is saying to the world , the court and me that they do n't care . " The classic corporate response to charges of racism , even when a jury finds in a plaintiffs favor , is usually silence if not denial , or the classic line " This was an isolated incident . " " In every case I have ever litigated , the corporation has never apologized , " says Jeffrey Needle , Lucas 's lawyer . " Even the most flagrant ones circle the wagons and never admit wrongdoing . " A Texaco spokesperson , for example , insists that the company 's decision to settle in the class-action bias case brought by Bari-Ellen Roberts is by no means an admission of wrongdoing . " It was a business decision , " says Edward N. Gadsden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diversity . " It was in response to those conversations at that finance-department meeting . There was a need for us to put the lawsuit behind us . " Employees who do decide to sue discover that if the work environment was hard to tolerate before , after you take legal action , it 's jungle warfare . Some time after Roberts filed her legal complaint , she checked out a computer laptop so she could work at home over the weekend . The standard procedure is to fill out a requisition form . But this time she was waved on and told she need n't bother . Her instincts kicked in immediately , alerting her to watch her back . Sure enough , as she walked across the company parking lot to her car , she was descended upon by a swarm of security guards , demanding to check her briefcase , questioning her about a company computer . Little did they know that Roberts , suspecting an ambush , had left the computer in her desk . " One of the best ways to discredit employees is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So when I was just given a laptop , I knew that something was incredibly wrong . " Just as tough is handling the isolation from other coworkers , especially those you considered friends . Roberts , who has since left the company to write a book about her experiences and to head up the AfricanAmerican Association for Corporate Responsibility , an advocacy group , still ca n't get over the backlash she received from her African-American colleagues , many of whom stopped talking to her after she filed suit . " Black people were so afraid even to identify with me , " she recalls . " Some were openly hostile , telling me not to speak to them or calling up and asking me Why are you starting all this trouble ? ' I felt like Daniel in the lion 's den . " Suing your employer is a hellish and lonely place to be . That 's why it 's important that members of the Black community begin pressuring companies they patronize or invest in to do the right thing . Black organizations and individuals can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporate commitment to diversity , similarly to the way they pressured companies to divest from South Africa . For example , as a shareholder you can write the corporate head of human resources and request a copy of the company 's EEOC 1 file , which shows the demographics of men and women within the organization . Ask about the racial composition of the members of the board . Attend the annual shareholders ' meeting and press for a shareholders ' resolution calling for a stronger commitment to diversity . Redwood of Americans for a Fair Chance advises that even before you accept a job offer at a large company , you should try to find out if it really practices what it preaches or merely pays lip service to the concept of diversity . At the interview , ask about the current salary range of the position you 're considering and the salary range for the person who previously held the job . Also ask specific questions about the company 's workforce demographics : How many reporting levels from the top is the most senior woman ? How many reporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You also need to inquire about family-friendly policies . Do they have flextime and " flexworkplace , " and who has access to them ? How are job openings posted ? What kind of relationship does the company have with nonprofit organizations ? Where do they recruit ? Do they participate in the United Negro College Fund ? And never sign any agreement giving up your right to take legal action against your employer . If you 're pressed to do so " or else , " you 'd be better off looking elsewhere . If you 're currently in a work situation where you believe you 're being discriminated against because of your race , your gender or both and are considering filing suit , rest assured you 're not alone . But in reality most people who would stand a good chance of proving discrimination wo n't sue and probably should n't , according to those who have been there , done that . You may be better off finding another job . But if you have to go there , how do you make your decision and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some smart advice : Make sure your case is well documented . Documentation can be in the form of journals , work appraisals , employment agreements , manuals or meeting notes . Do n't assume your employer has copies of notes of commendation or written terms of your employment . If you have n't been keeping a file , start now . Seek advice from a reliable professional experienced with equal-opportunity cases . This could be a friend with a law , human-resources or management background-someone who can help you decide if your case is strong . " Many things may be going on , but is it discrimination ? " asks Janice A. Booker , who filed an EEOC complaint against her employer , the U.S. Treasury Department . The EEOC wo n't even consider investigating a frivolous or weak case . Exhaust the remedies available in your company or agency , and never threaten to sue . Failing a resolution at your workplace , contact your state or local civil-rights commission for instructions on filing a claim . You will probably have to exhaust local remedies before winning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federal court . When you reach the point at which you have to retain a lawyer , seek out the best you can afford . These days , most lawyers will want a large retainer$5,000 to $6,000-and will charge an hourly fee , $250 on average . Try to get the lawyer to agree to a fixed flat rate or , if your case is exceptionally strong , to accept payment on a contingency basis , plus expenses . In some cases , an outside organization that shares a strong interest in your cause may offer help from a defense fund . Do not discuss your case with coworkers . When you seek support-and it 's critical that you do so-turn to friends outside your company , and even your field . Along the same line , do n't try to rally others to join you in your suit . Dr. Patricia Gunn , a professor of business law at Ohio University , says that your lawyer-not you-is the one to determine if the case should be class action . Expect retaliation and stress . Retaliation from your employer may come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism ; monitoring of your calls , E-mail or trash ; and efforts to slander you . Roberts says her company dug up a failing course grade of hers from 1971 as part of its case . Now is the time to renew your commitment to your personal life , your family and your spirituality or talk things out with a counselor . After Cortes filed her complaint , she made a first-time-ever pilgrimage to Brazil to meet her father 's family . The experience shored up her faith in herself and reinforced her resolve to stay the course . Be prepared financially in case you have to quit . Like Larry Lucas , you may have to remove yourself from a situation that 's just too lethal . Stay open to an offer of settlement . " It 's generally best for all parties if you can settle before going to trial , " adds Gunn . " If not , go for bear and take no prisoners .
