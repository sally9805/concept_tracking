How far we 've come . A year and a half after her world-traumatizing death , Princess Diana is back as the heroine of a stage musical  --  and no one cares ! To be sure , the unheralded off-Broadway show Queen of Hearts is too scrappy and simplistic to be very satisfying , even to connoisseurs of kitsch . Its Diana is an unnuanced saint whose key moment of insight comes when Princess Grace advises her , " Trust in yourself . Be who you are . " Yet the musical boasts an appealing Diana in Paula Leggett Chase , who has the hairstyle and the gangly grace and ( in songs like The Walls Are Closing In ) makes a decent case for her emotional strength . In a more polished show , she might win a few hearts herself . <P>  --  By Richard Zoglin
