And you thought chaperoning a grade-school field trip was challenging ? <p> The wording on the sign was unequivocal ; " You can not go on this ride if you are shorter than this line ! " The bright red horizontal line was a bare meter-thirty above Sam Boone 's feet-and at least six centimeters higher than the head of one of the Kittchikoostrans-catlike , black-clad galactic tourists-who was standing beside him . Hissssss ! " What does this say ? " the nearest Kittchikoostran insisted and angrily hissed something to the others in its own unearthly language . The untranslatable speech was quickly echoed by the fifty-three nearly identical copies of the speaker . All were attired in similar black , skin-tight uniforms . " Well ? " the testy Kittchikoostran hissed as it impatiently scratched the walkway . Sam gulped when he noted the depth of the gouges the Kitties 's claws were making in the tough paving . He 'd learned earlier that the Kittchikoostrans were as deficient on patience as they were on altitude . " It says there 's a four-hour wait , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Say , let 's try that one . " He pointed to the Hall of the Ex-Presidents across the way and quickly began walking in that direction , hoping to lead them away from a potentially disastrous refusal by the operators of the ride . The fifty-some aliens hesitated for a moment and then marched in lock step behind him . Sam wiped the sweat from his brow and let out the breath he 'd been holding . God , why had he ever allowed himself to be talked into escorting these perpetually hissed-off aliens to Disneyworld-where they thought they were , having not yet detected Sam 's slight bit of misdirection ? After centuries of effort , humanity had finally achieved sufficient technological sophistication and cooperation to build a star-going vessel and had sent it forth to conquer the universe . Within a month of setting out the ship had made contact with a member of the galactic hegemony and had returned to inform Earth that the aliens would be arriving shortly . To become a member of a galaxywide civilization , to set foot on planets alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , stirred the minds and hearts of everyone on the face of the Earth ! With breathless anticipation the entire planet awaited the arrival of the diplomats , the representatives of the wise elder races , mankind 's first visit by extraterrestrial intelligent life forms . The first galactics to arrive seemed to find humanity 's preoccupation with electromagnetism rather quaint and puzzling . " Phloomb , " one of these arrivals had proclaimed to Earth 's leaders with booming confidence , " is a much simpler and more accessible technology . Would you be interested in buying , " the smooth-talking Gelderion had asked in oily terms , " a few hundred phloomb generators , a handful of interstellar ships , a dozen or so long-range ansibles , and a few million fuchsia wutzler-logs ? " All were , he assured them , " prime examples of galactic civilization 's cornucopia of technologies . " " If you act fast , " the alien emissary suggested with a slight edge in its voice , " I can give you some really good prices . Just sign here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or maybe South America ? " Needless to say , no nation , with the exception of France , was willing to sell off a goodly hunk of real estate for what might be the galactic equivalent of twenty-four bucks worth of beads . The Gelderion 's parting remarks after Earth 's political leaders " polite refusal of its offer wilted the closest vegetation and peeled the paint from the walls of facing buildings . Nobody asked for a translation . Which left Earth to do what any impoverished , backward , technologically unsophisticated culture had to in order to gain sufficient credits to buy things on the galactic market : they let themselves be exploited . At the same time , everyone hoped to discover the niche , any niche that humanity could fill so that it could claim a place in the greater hegemonic scheme of things . And so Sam found himself working for CT &T,; Crumptonian Tours and Trade , an alien travel agency specializing in escorting visitors to the Earth 's more interesting and exotic sites . Sam 's earlier successes with a variety of alien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vicious and temperamental Kittchikoostrans-a race who were not known for their sanguine temperaments . In a rather mild fit of pique , Djef and Dorth , as these two identified themselves , had not only made a shambles of the main ( and only ) office of CT &T; but had left Sam with no eyebrows , several first-degree burns , and a shock of singed hair that became the envy of every teenager who had seen him , such was the sad state of coiffure in twenty-second century Earth . The Kittchikoostrans were best known for three characteristics . The first , and most important , was that they were group minds , Djef , for example , consisted of thirty-two individual Kitties , while Dorth-Djef 's " mate " - numbered twenty-two . Second and third characteristics on the short list , if you will excuse the term , were their hair-trigger tempers and a complete absence of patience . Sam had heard from dependable sources that Djef and Dorth had slagged a trans port at one of the way stations en-route to Earth simply because it waited too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on edge since Mardnn had scheduled the trip to Disneyworld and was constantly alert to any slight or misstep that might set the diminutive aliens off . On the plane trip down to Orlando , Sam had put the two ( or fifty-four , depending on how you wanted to count them ) Kitties in coach while he reposed in first class among several resplendently garbed Pequodistas . There , in luxurious splendor , isolated from his charges , he had sipped on a cool and highly alcoholic drink to calm his frayed nerves . The Pequodistas were gray-skinned galactics with large rose-colored bladders on each side of their throats and a tangle of worm-like " fingers " growing from the sides of their heads . Speech , for them , consisted of drumming the bladders with the " fingers " to produce a not unpleasant humming sound . Hmmmmmmmm . MmmHmmm ? " Are n't you the human who sold me those wonderful magazines ? " one of the Peqs hummed into a small gray box from which emerged a reasonably understandable stream of glax , the galactic lingua franca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand her . He 'd seen these translators before . They turned the Peq 's humming speech into something other beings could understand . Sam looked at the speaker . The Peqs all looked so much alike , but now that he thought about it , this one appeared to be somewhat familiar . .. Yes , now he had it ! Just a week before , he had business with a Peq . Maybe this was the same one ? Sam stared at the box . That Peq-what was her name ? - had one just like it . " Yes , " he admitted in response to her question . Hmmm ; " Ahbbbb , " the Pequodista introduced herself . " And you are the untranslatable Sam Boone who helped me gain much wealth . " " Glad to help , er , Ahbbbb " Sam replied , recognizing the name and amazed at the humming translation of his words that emerged from the Peq 's end of the translator . " Always willing to help . " " Admired the way you dealt with us , " Ahbbbb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth , and could use someone with your talents-someone who might want to make a fortune out there . " She stuck a thin arm out from the mound of fabric that swaddled her and waved at the heavens . " I need a human to do some travelling for me . " " Thanks , but no , " Sam replied . " I have enough money to live quite well . Besides , I still have n't exhausted all of the attractions on Earth , so why should I leave ? No , I think I 'll stay right here . " He raised his glass , took a deep drink , and settled back to admire the tightly rounded bottom of the stewardess as she leaned over to help someone seated up ahead . Life was good . The Peqs " muted humming conversation had nearly lulled him to sleep when there was a scream from coach . Something told him that it had to do with the Kitties . As it did . Sam learned that Djef had savaged a rude passenger who insisted on pushing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Dorth ( how did one refer to these weird beings ? Sam wondered ? ) . As soon as they landed and the Kitties had been safety seated on the bus C &T; had arranged , Sam agreed to pay for the man 's shredded pants and torn tunic , with an additional promise to compensate for the boor 's whip burns and sundry flesh wounds , not to mention the poor man 's mental anguish for having to cower in the locked toilet for the rest of the trip . Sam was n't worried about the possibility of legal action against CT &T:; There could be no lawsuit due to the Alien Sufferance and Support Act of " 73 , which made it nearly impossible for a human to sue a galactic visitor for any act committed through accidents , differing mores , or lack of courtesy . All Earth realized that the potential of lost trade , not to mention the resulting galactic credits , overrode any petty infractions caused by inter-species ignorance . Of course the people of Kansas City would never be convinced of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown area had been turned into a smoking crater when one of its restaurants had made some galactic visitors wait three hours for a table-and then had served meat ! But , the politicians assured the city fathers , they would feel differently after the crater filled in with flood water to form a perfectly circular lake . And that would be something any reasonable city would be proud to own . Meanwhile civic organizations everywhere were reconsidering their standard tour itineraries . The hotel where Sam had made reservations had added its own wonderful complications to the trip . " You will have to board your , ah , animals in the kennels , " the clerk remarked primly , with a barely concealed sniff . " We 've just received word that this hotel now has a strict no-aliens " policy . We got rid of the others this afternoon . Might I add that it was about time , too ! " He shot his starched cuffs and flicked a speck of imaginary dust from his sleeve . Sam tried to contain his anger . He had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then , maybe the clerk was from Kansas City . " That 's not fair . I reserved an entire floor of rooms for the Kittchikoostrans " express use , " he dedared . " We paid in advance ! " " I 'm afraid that I can not honor your reservation , " the clerk replied , clearly indicating by the tone of his voice that someone had obviously made a mistake in booking the group , a mistake that he intended to rectify on the spot . " That 's a ridiculous , incredibly stupid policy ! " Sam yelled in exasperation . " This is Orlando , aliens come here by the hundreds , the thousands ! It 's the mecca for practically every damn alien who sets foot on Earth . " That last was a bit of hyperbole , since Hoboken and Kawasaki 's Sushi " n Ribs were equally famous attractions to the sophisticated galactic travelers . " Damn it , I demand to talk to whoever set this stupid policy . It 's the dumbest thing I 've ever heard ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someplace more , ah , interested in your type of clients ? " The smirking clerk turned away to burnish a spot on his pristine marble countertop with his thumb . The Djef speaker had been standing silently beside Sam through the entire exchange . Out of the corner of his eye Sam saw the Kittchikoostran reach for his belt . Sam felt cold sweat break out on his forehead . What sort of fiendish device was the tiny alien about to unleash ? He did n't want another damn incident today , no matter how much the clerk and his stupid hotel deserved it ! He started to say something , hoping to divert Djef from whatever he intended , but the alien was too quick . With a smooth flowing motion it pulled an oblong black object from its belt and tossed it at the clerk . Sam 's hand darted out to intercept , but the clerk had faster hands , snatched it from the air , and popped it open . " What is . . . ? , he began and then turned red , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slightly rosy shade of white as he read the paper that emerged from one end of the container . " What the hell ? " Sam asked as he admired the ability of the clerk to alter his coloration with such speed . It was a trait he 'd not suspected any member of the human race of possessing . " You . . . you . . " the clerk sputtered , staring alternately at the tiny alien and the paper in his trembling hands , " . . you things own this hotel ? " He seemed to have a bit of difficulty squeaking the words out . Hissss ! " Yes , and we are the ones who want these aliens out of here , immediately ! " The clerk looked puzzled . " But , but . . . there are no aliens left in the hotel , " he insisted . " We threw them all out ! " Three of Djef 's tribe leaped onto the counter so that their slit-like green eyes were staring directly into those of the stammering clerk . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clerk . " You ! You and your human kind are the aliens we are talking about ! This is now a restricted hotel . Get all of those who are not galactic citizens out-immediately ! " " Move ! " screamed Djef when the clerk remained immobile . Zappft ! A tongue of flame lightly touched the clerk 's carefully coifed hairdo . Simultaneously , all thirty-two of Djef 's corporate body hissed loudly , a sound not unlike a jet fighter making a low-level pass before releasing its load of napalm . The twenty-two tiny beings that comprised the mute Dorth stood demurely by , lazily cracking their whips in the air . Sam interceded while the flailing clerk was preoccupied by his blazing hairdo . " Is n't eviction of all the humans a trifle hasty ? " he suggested to Djef . " After all , it will take some time to fill the hotel with galactic visitors . No sense turning away paying customers and profits for the sake of principle , is there ? " Djef 's speaker stopped its admiration of the clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You speak of principle and profits as if they were different , " it said with a puzzled note in its voice . " But i understand what you say . All right , " it hissed over the counter , " the humans can stay , but they must pay in galactic credits , none of this quaint Earth currency , you hear me ? " The clerk lifted his smoking head from its refuge beneath the marble counter . " Galactic credits , " he repeated blankly , as if trying to grasp the concept of commerce with his limited intellect . " Pay , " he said , finally making a feeble connection . " Should n't be too hard to deal with , " Sam assured him with only a hint of malice . " The galactic currency 's a base fifteen system , with the lower denominations in base twelve . You wo n't have to worry unless you have to make change . " The clerk 's eyes flicked back and forth between Sam and the tiny alien , as if he were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam had once seen that same haunted look in the eyes of a trapped raccoon when it heard the barking of an approaching squad of dogs . Their rooms were very nice . The service was excellent . The officials at Disneyworld , now a state in its own right , had not been willing to accept Sam 's assurances that the Kittchikoostrans were only two individuals , not a pack of aliens trying to foil their head counts . The officials persisted in their belief that the number of individual bodies comprising a person was the absolute count rather than , as Sam had insisted , the number of souls in question . Neither did an offer of a small bribe change their minds , which made Sam 's attempts fail on both the mundane and spiritual levels . So much for epistemology , he thought , and wondered how he could gracefully manage to get the fift , - four little aliens into the park while remaining within Mardnnn 's parsimonious budget . Since none of the Kittchikoostrans understood Earthlish they left it to Sam to translate the various signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to skillfull , divert his alien charges past the gates of Disney World and through those of UniverseLand , an alternative and highly derivative park just outside the legal reach of the great Disney empire . The forward-looking officials of Universeland , gentlemen of refinement and honor , who took Sam 's bribe without so much as blinking , did not argue with Sam 's suggested head count . The duck-faced ticket-taker at UniverseLand 's park entrance did n't even blink when Sam showed up with his militaristic Kittchikoostrans though the gates . This was not surprising , given the parade of alien visitors who had already passed through these gates over the past few years . Sam doubted that even the first alien to enter would have surprised the ticket-takers . After all , when they were daily surrounded by such fantastic creatures as a two-meter-tall rat , talking chipmunks , and an array of characters comic , fantastic , and fictional , why would one more bit of weirdness bother them ? Sam had feared that herding the two ( or was it fifty-four ? ) Kittchikoostrans would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with individuals and clumps dashing off in all directions . But the Kitties were remarkably well-behaved in that respect , forming in two well-defined groups . Sam thought that someone with a discerning eye could easily detect the small differences between which Kitties were Dorth and those who were Djef . Any sharp-eyed observer would note their slight differences in size , detect a hint of shading in eye colors , discern the way Dorth tilted her head to the right , recognize the perky angle of Djef 's ears , and acknowledge that the Djef contingent were all brown while Dorth 's were tan ( or would that be " was ' ? ) Sam was always confused when applying human grammar to alien races in general and the Kittchikoostrans in particular The walk down UniverseLand 's Central Avenue caused no particular stir among the hordes of tourists streaming into the park . In fact , he imagined that most probably thought that his petite aliens were merely another element of the park 's magic . The Kittchikoostrans had no problems on either Ms. Frog 's ride or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An interesting experience , this continuous alteration of force and direction vectors under variable speed conditions , - Djef had remarked as some of its members were whirled around and about . " However I fail to see why they insist that the riders must be secured . Would it not be more interesting without the bars holding them in ? " Sam tried to imagine the effect of the teacups tossing the diminutive Kitties over the heads of the merry crowd , and maybe splattering a few against the walls of the nearby Capt'n Cook 's Samoan Restaurant . " I doubt it , " he answered . Dorth was disappointed when they could n't get on the Elephant rides . A flock of Netsrots from Lommoruse were hogging every one of the large eared cars , squealing and screaming as the swooping ride threw their massive bodies outward , held back only by the firm grip their tentacles had on the cars " trunks . The Netsrots were obviously having a hell of a time and signified it by beating the sides of their Elephant cars with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the threshold of pain . The Netsrots " long necks were higher than the top of the ride 's central mast and , occasionally one of the Netsrots would lean its head too far to the side and whack its beak on the pumpkin cornices of a nearby gingerbread kiosk . The pumpkins , after repeated beak whackings , were decidedly worse for wear and had begun to resemble well chewed apple cores . On the other hand , the Nesrots appeared to be quite unaffected by the repeated impacts . Sam noticed quite a few other alien races in the crowd . These were vastly outnumbered by the plethora of humans who were vainly struggling to master UniverseLand 's seven thousand acre complex of rides , restaurants , amusements , shopping centers , transportation hubs , and assorted hotels , motels , and hostels . Many of the human tourists had bright badges that identified them as being on the extended five-day tours of Florida theme parks . These usually guaranteed " Fifty rides per day or your money back ! " Sam wondered at the wisdom of setting such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shepherded into the lines for yet another of their daily allotment of rides by their ever-cheerful and perky guides . The guides " sincerity and solicitude might have been more convincing were it not for the worn grips of the cattle prods that hung at their waists . After entering the Hall of the ex-Presidents , Djef and Dorth became fascinated by the smoothly animated robotic characters on the stage , especially the Ronald Reagan one-hardly updated since its days in the oval office . The little aliens grew confused by everyone 's laughter whenever the Ford automatron tripped , and became even more so when the Clinton robot patted thwellupholstered behind of Madame sixtyninth ex-president . The more recent presidential robots were even more boring than their realworld counterparts , if possible . Such , Sam reflected , had been the unexpected consequence of the probity the electorate demanded in its candidates . Lack of any sort of enjoyment or business involvement whatsoever had become the watchword for candidates . Cal Coolidge 's looked like a party animal in comparison with robots of the last forty presidents . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more smoothly than Sam had expected , given the nasty disposition of his charges . But that could have been expected ; the sight of the regiment of Kittchikoostrans perambulating in syncopated synchronicity kept most people , and all of the other aliens , away from any troubling confrontation . Things were going so well that Sam relaxed for the first time in days and actually began to enjoy himself . Then they came to the Tiny Universe ride . Sam had his group of Kitties lined up in a row and waited until enough boats arrived to mount everyone ( both of them ? ) at the same time , earning him not a few grumbles from the waiting crowd of adults accompanied by their impatient children , many of whom became quite vocal over the delay . *Why do they have to bring kids to a place like this ? " Sam grumbled as he climbed into the lead boat . He could faintly hear the ride s music from the opening just ahead- " It 's a teensy-tiny , eeny-weeny cosmos ... " The tune was somewhat catchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the boats , they began to move smoothly forward through the entrance and slowly past the tiny dioramas . From every direction came the endless , repeating " It 's a teensy-tiny , eeny-weeny cosmos . . n The music continued unabated as the boats wove their way among the displays . The Kittchikoostrans quietly observed the hundreds of tiny dolls , each group resembling some alien life form . Every member of the galactic hegemony was there , all arranged in suspiciously , if somewhat contrived , cute , exotic settings . Sam had met just a few of the represented races . He recognized the huge lumbering Dermitts from the disastrous Kansas City trip , although the dolls did n't sport the huge blasters of the originals . He recognized the group of resplendently clad Pequodistas and , beside them , the slithering , purple Glerens . Sam laughed with recognition of the furry blue Freisnilles who 'd once helped him ruin the craps tables at Atlantic City . But the remainder were some he had never encountered or seen-it appeared that the galaxy had produced a host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine . Sam 's boss , for example , was a grumpy , sessile , blue cone of a creature with a single eye stalk and tentacle , which was quite an improvement over the agent with whom he 'd formerly worked . Still , the exhibition within this particular ride was wider than he 'd expected . Apparently the management had spared no expense in getting all of the races that had visited the Earth into the display in one form or another . How they knew the proper backgrounds for the various alien worlds was beyond Sam 's ken . It was enough that his charges seemed to be enjoying the parade of condensed galactic culture although , Sam noted , there was a slight twitching of their ears whenever the music loop started to repeat " It 's a teensy-tiny , eenyweeny cosmos .... " The twitching seemed to grow more pronounced as the long ride progressed . They were just passing the Imperials " exhibit , where some dolls who resembled that race were flashing their communication organs ( or were they sex organs ? Sam could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , when the boats jolted to an abrupt stop . " Just a minor problem , " Sam reassured Djef and Dorth as they rose in obvious panic . " We 'll start moving soon . " Whatever had halted the boats apparently did not affect the music , for it continued to repeat , over and over , the same lyrics , the same notes , the same sickeningly sweet , gooey , sugary tune , and those maddening , appealing words , " It 's a tiny , eeny-weeny cosmos .... " The loop continued over and over until Samthought he would go mad . Already , his mind was anticipating the loop as if the notes and lyrics of the song had been burned into the neural pathways of his brain . The song drove out all other thoughts , all other functions . He felt himself entering a trance-like teensy-tiny state of eeny-weeny being . A flicker of movement to his right caught his attention . He turned his head . One of Djef was standing on the seat . Its ears were folded back tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of " It 's a teensy-tiny , eeny-weeny cosmos .... H/ssssss ! the assembled Kittchikoostran shouted as one , or two actually , as the speaker 's blaster belched forth hissing flames of intense white flame that incinerated the tiny figures , flaring their little doll clothing to bright sparks of incandescence , and melting their teensytiny faux alien heads into eeny-weeny puddles of molten plastic . The music continued . " It 's a teensytiny , eeny-weeny cosmos .. " over and over and over and . . With a scream like the very banshees from hell , Dorth , all twenty-two of her , leaped from the boats and ran amok , slashing at the displays with her whips , beheading the dolls , destroying the settings as they clambered up , up , and up to reach the speakers mounted on the overhead girders . Bright sparks leaped as they ripped the loudspeakers from their mounts and tossed them into the water below . But the music did n't stop , From the settings ahead and behind came the faint repeated strains of " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screeched as the Djefs deployed to attack the forward regions while the Dorths concentrated on the nether . There were screams of adults and children as the Kitties wreaked havoc on the interior , battling the hated song to silence , trying to make it stop once and for all . The boats jerked once . Sam , who had been standing up and pleading with his charges to stop what they were doing , tumbled backwards over the seat and struck his head . For a moment he could think of nothing but " It 's a teensy-tiny , eeny-weeny cosmos . . . " repeating endlessly through his mind as a teeny-tiny universe of stars flashed before his eyes . Reflections of the flames from the Kittchikoostran blaster receded behind as his boat moved forward . The song continued to repeat over and over and over and over until he was certain that he was quite , quite mad . But not nearly so mad as the park of ficials who greeted him as the boat emerged . Sam found it hard to take seriously someone dressed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluffy tails appeared to be the costumes du jour-even though , intellectually , he knew better . The squirrels were surrounded , he noted , by a considerable crowd of angry adults . Most of those nearby appeared to have wet pant legs and each bore one or two wailing children . All of these were pointing at the boat in which he sat and screaming imprecations . Sam stepped from the boat with as much dignity as he could muster and discovered that his head was still twitch ing in time with the pervasive Tiny Universe rhythm . " Is there some sort of problem ? " he asked pleasantly as , behind him , the sounds of destruction continued . He tried to still his jerking head when he heard the music loop begin to repeat " It 's a teensy-tiny , eeny . . - SQUAWK ! " Blessed silence ensued . The crowd flinched back as Djef and Dorth emerged ; one contingent sloshing from the entrance and the other from the exit portals . Some of each had tiny hats on their heads , while others waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destroyed speaker system . The squirrelly officials began screaming something at Sam as the Kittchikoostrans lined up beside him . Sam could not grasp what the park wanted from him , for the song continued to loop in his head , drowning out all other thoughts . One of the squirrels , his fluffy tail flapping about his shoulders , made a clumsy grab for the wires from one of the passing Djefs and tripped . As he fell he reached out accidently ripped the belt from the Kitties " uniform . CRACK ! Ten whips snapped at the fallen squirrel as another of the Dorth 's snatched the belt from where it had fallen . Before Sam knew what was happening he found himself being propelled along by a dozen of ( or was it oneninth of ? ) the Kittchikoostrans . Djef formed a brown flying squad ahead as Sam and his escort raced through the crowd . Dorth 's tans followed and provided a rear guard for their escape . " No , no , " Sam screamed . " Stop ! Put me down ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kittchikoostrans listened . They raced across the footpath , down a slope , past a sign that said , " Your wait will be three hours from this point , " and around two barricades , where they astonished a crowd of waiting passengers , who clapped their pleasure at this unexpected bit of excitement . One of the Cajun Country 's longboats had just emptied as the racing Kitties , still carrying Sam , rushed the pier . Three of Djef 's cohort tipped the surprised steersman into the drink while the rest piled themselves and Sam on board before shoving the boat away from the dock . " Hey ! " yelled a piratically-clad attendant as he tried to simultaneously keep the waiting passengers from falling into the empty space where the boat had been while attempting to grab the longboat 's rail . With his attention focused on two dimensions he forgot the third and tumbled into the ersatz river , alongside the drenched steersman . And then the boat was around the first turn and out of sight of the angry and confused pirates , although not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half-dozen of Dorth who were holding Sam finally released him . He immediately sat up and tried to figure out where they were . As best he could recall there was n't a canal system leading out of the park , so this must just be another ride-not an escape route . BOOOM ! There was a flash of cannon on the left as they rounded a bend and came upon a representation of a pirate 's enclave . BOOM ! The cannon sounded again and there was a splash next to the boat . All of the Kitties on that side were drenched by the spray . As one all of the Kitties looked toward the smoking cannon . Their ears were pinned back against their skulls and their teeth were bared . " NO ! " screamed Sam as he suddenly realized what was about to happen . But his shout was too late . Djef 's reaction had been immediate and decisive . As one , all thirty-two of Djef 's bodies whipped out their blasters and lay down a fusillade of fire that set the entire pirate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding plastic forest . But the uneven firefight was cut short as the longboat made another turn around a bend , which hid the devastation they had caused from sight , but revealed a crocodile with jaws agape snapping at their side . Zappft ! Four simultaneous blasts from the hand weapons were enough to render the ersatz croc into an expanding cloud of component plastic and metal parts . Sam flinched as the rain of automatronic organs showered the vessel . Through the descending cloud he caught a glimpse of several bespotted agents of the Squirrel charging through the jungle . They seemed to be running parallel to the river 's course . " Pull into the bank up there , " Sam suggested , pointing just ahead . " Let 's wait for them there . " Perhaps he could still manage to talk his way out of this increasingly dangerous situation . Yes , this was definitely a time for conciliation . The many heads of Djef jerked around at a shout from their dogged pursuers . Dorth grounded the vessel on the bank opposite the spot Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Djef , pushed , pulled , prodded , and yanked along with the mass of black-clad Kittchikoostrans as they raced up a bank , leaped a low fence and charged onto a walkway , scattering civilians in all directions . " Which way ? " Djef hissed quickly . " How do we make our escape ? " " You do n't have to escape , " Sam tried to explain . " Let me take care of this . It 's all a misunderstanding . " Djef 's angry response told Sam that it was obvious that the Kitties were in no mood to palaver now that they had their dander up . Any attempted discussions with their furry pursuers were doomed to failure , or worse ! Sam looked around , trying to identify something familiar , some landmark that he could use as guidance for their escape . There ! He caught sight of the park 's flag-covered ramparts , which could be seen from every spot in the park . Perhaps , if he could get the little aliens to a place where they could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this disastrous turn of events from getting any worse . " This way ! " he yelled and the fifty-odd charged . " Uh-oh ! " Reinforcements were bearing down upon them from the direction of a distant medieval castle , cutting off that line of travel . " That way , " Sam yelled , pointing south , toward the Old West exhibits . Djef and Dorth turned as one . The Kitties in at the van threw blazing bolts over the heads of their pursuers . Sam thought furiously as he pounded along with the Kitties , trying to think of some other way to avert disaster . Where could he secure the maddened aliens for whatever time it would take to calm them down ? What was there .... He had it ! Now , the only problem was getting them there . He quickly reviewed his options : Should he lead them through the Old West or take a detour through Bobcat Country ? He decided on the latter since the automatronic gunslingers of the Old West would probably set off the Kitties even more . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that decared " From this point you have a twohour wait , " ran through the entrance and into the middle of a performance by the singing musical bobcats . One of these was raising his trumpet just as the first few of Djef leaped through the door . Zappft ! One blaster bolt caught the bobcat in midlift , rendering his trumpet , arms , and much of his head into a ball of flame and spitting sparks . Children in the audience squealed with delight as the catlike aliens leaped onto the stage , dodged among the automatronic bobcats , and headed for the red exit sign . Sam panted with the effort as he tried to keep up . They exited and ran into a crowd encircling a huge chicken who was sputtering wildly in apparent exasperation , much to everyone 's delight . As soon as the fifty-some Kitties ran into the area , everyone , adults and children alike , turned to watch this new diversion . Djef and Dorth organized themselves into flanking squads that could cover every approach while they waited for Sam 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of state troopers and local constabulary burst through the flowering shrubbery at the head of a mixed squad of brightly clad characters that had chosen to accompany their pursuers . Along with the sweat-drenched and lightly scorched squirrels , there were some technical types in orange coveralls and various sundry historic comic book characters . From the reaction of the Kittchikoostrans Sam knew that there was going to be an armed confrontation unless he did something , and quickly ! People were likely to be harmed , chief among which was his own precious self . He had to do something . He searched about for something with which to distract either sidesomething that would draw attention , relieve tension-and then he spotted it . With a scream he ripped the chicken 's head off and rolled it at the advancing cartoonish crowd as if they were a set of tenpins . The lead man tripped over the rolling head and went down , followed by a handful of his followers . Meanwhile the children were screaming that Sam had murdered their damned chicken , which was now turning in ever-increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brightly-colored wires in its neck . For some reason Sam had expected to find a.human being inside the suit , not a robot . But there was no time to reflect on the vagaries of the latest version of the Equal Opportunity Act while the pursuit was distracted . " Follow me ! " he yelled and pushed through the thin fringe of brush that separated them from the park 's railway . Luckily , a chubby-faced train was coming , moving at a sedate walking pace and emitting wheezes and puffs more suitable to an eighty-year-old marathon runner . Sam leaped onto the smiling purple engine as Djef and Dorth forced their way onto the cars behind . " Hey ! " the bushy-mustachioed engineer said as Sam reached for the throttle . " No time to talk , " Sam said and shoved the lever all . the way forward while he held the engineer at bay with his foot . The train started to accelerate , first achieving a trotting speed , then a brisk run , and finally started to really move out , leaving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissing Djef , still wearing his Tiny Universe hats , who had appeared from behind , screamed and leaped from the train . " Where are we going ? " the Djef speaker asked . " To get you out of here ! " Sam shouted back and waved gaily at the waiting crowd on the platform as the train raced through the station without stopping . Lord , he hoped that he remembered the layout of the park right . Unless he was mistaken the next stop would be . . . Yes , there it was-Galaxyland ! He pulled the throttle back and applied the brake , bringing the happyfaced train to a sudden , silent halt . This way ! " he said and leaped off with the Kittchikoostrans following like lambs to the slaughter . Sam raced around the side of the Galaxyland station , across Astro Plaza and into an entrance decorated with flashing lights and sparkling screens . Desperately he pushed the waiting crowd aside , leaped barriers disguised as handrails , and charged across the display areas without regard for signs or distractions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his alien crew was following his lead . There ! This was the ride he was looking for . Fortunately a ship had just disembarked . He took out the leading group of tourists who were heading for the ship with a body block and waved the Kitties into the ship . " Go , go ! I 'll hold them off ? " he yelled . With uncanny precision the fifty-odd Kittchikoostrans filed into the waiting spaceship . " Come on ! " Djef yelled from within the hatch . Sam raced forward , grabbed the edges of the hatch , and slammed it shut in Djef 's face , dogging the hatch firmly in place . With a roar of flame and a rocking motion the ship lifted off and rose out of sight through the hole in the overhead . Sam waved bye-bye from the launch ing pad at the Kittie faces pressed tightly to the portholes , breathed a sigh of relief , dusted himself off , and turned to the advancing attendant . " If you value your life you 'll keep them in that ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , the ship was twisting and turning to simulate an interplanetary trip , going around and around and around , following the endless rail that supported it . It took the rest of the day for Sam to convince Mardnnn , the head of CT &T,; that he should use his insurance policy to pay UniverseLand for the damages inflicted by the Kitties . The UniverseI.and officials released Sam once CT &T's; insurance agent confirmed that they would be adequately compensated . " VIadish dam you do n't come back ! " Mardnnn had spit out angrily when he learned of Sam 's deceit . " You fried ! " " You mean fired , " Sam corrected his boss " poor Earthlish . " That , too ! " Mardnnn replied . " And if you come back you fried ! " Sam had no doubt of his meaning . Sam 's Kittchikoostrans had been pulled from their looping trip hours before , much mollified by the endless circling and tumbling action of the spaceship ride . They had been sent back to the hotel under armed escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a flying squad of state police , none of whom , for some strange reason , seemed too keen on the assignment . Sam took a bus back to the hotel with a group of richly clothed Pequodistas . They turned out to be the same ones who 'd been on the plane . Ahbbbb had a black-eared hat perched on her head , nestled amongst her writhing medusalike appendages . From the pleasant humming among the crowd of Peqs it appeared that they had thoroughly enjoyed their trip to Disney 's Epcot county . Ahbbbb mentioned that they were looking forward to visiting UniverseLand the next day . " Stay away from the Tiny Universe ride , " Sam warned them as the bus pulled up to the hotel . " It 's a killer ! " Sam waved goodbye to the cluster of Peqs and stepped out . No sooner had his foot touched the pavement than , from far above , he heard a loud hiss . He looked up . All the windows along the seventh floor were open and from each projected at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that they were n't holding a grudge for his deceit . " It 's Sam ! " he yelled . " I 'm back-everything 's all right ! " Zappftl Twin bolts of blaster fire hit on either side of him . A third bolt singed the emerging hairs of his head , while a fourth ignited the corner of his jacket . Sam jumped backwards into the bus as the driver pushed the pedal to the floor to get out of the alien 's field of fire . He rolled on the floor while the Pequodistas smothered his jacket 's flames . " About that job offer , " Sam asked as Ahbbbb helped him to his feet . " Is it still open ? " Hmmm , Ahbbbb hummed . Her translator did not respond . She lifted it up and thumped it hard with fist , then shook it until little rattling sounds like broken glass come from within . Why not take the job ? Sam thought as he waited for her answer : This might be a chance to visit other worlds , an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open hew horizons , to explore , to learn , to discover what 's over the next ridge , to become filthy rich , and to simply get away from these soreassed Kitties and his homicidal boss . Taken altogether , these were appeals that no red-blooded human male would refuse . HAMM Ahbbbb said emphatically . " Yes , the offer is still open , " the box finally translated . " When can I start ? " Sam Boone said with a smile , sticking out his hand to close the deal .
