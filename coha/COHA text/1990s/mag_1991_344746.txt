For four years , the list of approved drugs for AIDS patients began and ended with AZT . The drug , also called zidovudine , can extend a patient 's life-span , but not everyone can tolerate its side effects , which may include nausea and severe anemia . Now , after billions of dollars of research and constant pressure from AIDS activists , the Food and Drug Administration has bypassed some of its usual requirements to approve another medication , didanosine , known as DDI . <P> Developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb , DDI resembles AZT in that it interferes with replication of the AIDS virus . Whether it will extend the life of patients remains unknown , but it has been shown to boost levels of disease- fighting T cells . Last week 's approval , granted with unusual speed , will enable doctors to prescribe the drug to those who can not tolerate AZT  --  about half of AIDS patients . <P> Though AIDS activists were delighted with the decision , there are several concerns . About 23,000 people have been receiving the pills for free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay $2,000 a year for the treatment . Bristol-Myers says , however , that it will continue to offer free pills to those who can not afford the drug or obtain insurance coverage . Another worry is side effects , including inflammation of the pancreas , numbness in the hands and feet , and diarrhea . Most important , DDI has yet to pass the rigorous testing usually required by the FDA . " We are giving DDI a status it has not earned , and we are lowering the scientific standards for drug approval , " complains Dr. Deborah Cotton of Harvard , who reviewed the DDI approval application . FDA chief David Kessler justifies the decision by saying that " people are dying . " Whether DDI can forestall their deaths will be clearer within six months , when the results of clinical trials are in.
