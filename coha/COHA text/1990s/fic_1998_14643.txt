Scene rudolf valentino : At the guard rail of the observation deck of the Empire State Building . It is raining . Two women ( JANE and her MOTHER ) stand next to each other , glaring into the mists below . MOTHER How long after you leap do you , do you think , make impact ? Land . Hit the sidewalk . JANE BUB How would I know a thing like that ? MOTHER Are n't you one who knows everything , with that degree in what nonlinear wah-wah ? JANE BUB Have n't you seen enough , Mother ? MOTHER In fact , it 's about eight and a half seconds . JANE BUB Do you want to go down ? What do you want to do , Mother ? MOTHER Eight and a half seconds . I know these things . I looked it up . JANE BUB Mother ? MOTHER What on earth would give you that idea ? Is n't it clear that I am engaged upon the thinking of a thought ? ( Pause . ) Upon the body of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think I am equipped with the appropriate apparatus ? Do you think I am a speed gun ? p. 3 MOTHER How would I know ? I like it up here . No one can ask you what you 're thinking or what you 're feeling or what your life has been like since the moment you lost that last shred of hope in humanity . Because that is the kind of thing people would like to know , being people . Do n't you think so ? ( Daughter does n't know what to say or do . ) Well ? Oh Sarah , sometimes I truly wonder . Wonder if the way I think and the way you think are linked by the same coaxial cable . JANE BUB Let 's not talk about that , and whatever else I do not want to talk about Bermuda . MOTHER You brought it up , not me . JANE BUB I do not want to talk about Bermuda . MOTHER You brought it up , and why would I want to talk about Bermuda ? JANE BUB I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you please listen to me : I do not have the slightest intention of even mentioning the word " Bermuda , " much less touch upon the place . JANE BUB Mother , I do not want to talk about Bermuda , and that 's that . MOTHER I am not talking about Bermuda . I would not even be thinking of the word that stands for that place , that place where you faced for a moment p. 4 JANE BUB I do not want to talk about Bermuda , Mother , and if you should so much as mention the word again I shall leap over this rail and plunge to my death MOTHER Sarah , why would you do such a thing ? Why would you consider such an ill-advised and desperate act all because of a single rather simple world . Word , I mean . A name . A name is a world of a word , I find. * A known name that is JANE BUB Mother , did you listen to what I said ? MOTHER Sarah , the name is so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sarah , for Pete 's sake , it 's the name of an onion . It is the name of a species of shorts . Are you claiming a suicidal tendency on the basis of the name of an onion ? JANE BUB I do not want to talk about Bermuda . I do not want to talk about Bermuda . I do not want to talk about Bermuda . ( Pause . ) MOTHER I was not talking about that . JANE BUB You were hinting in that direction . MOTHER I was not . JANE BUB You were too . ( Pause . ) MOTHER I was not . p. 5 JANE BUB You were too . MOTHER Sarah , Sarah . I was merely going to suggest , out of the benefit of my many years a few thoughts . A few cankered thoughts touching upon your behavior , if one can call it that , in recent years . A few thoughts touching upon the exact moment , the exact moment* one loses one 's soul . JANE BUB Mother , please , you 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know why people always assume there is a correct way to talk . I mean , it is such an assumption that we have anything at all to say to one another . And maybe we truly do n't . Maybe the truth is far more scary than even the books with terrible clawed faces we read as children , or as cats . The faces of Rapunzel and the dwarves . The dwarf of Father Riley , the old dwarf known as Stopes of Nokes , the dwarf of Anomalous Narcolepsy , the seven-toed dwarf of Reptile Boulevard and all the glimmering , lazy-eyed rest . Folk of a devil parable . Nope , maybe we all tend to that center of gravity , down there , Hell , spooked and propelled at the very same time by the noise of our old shame . JANE BUB Mother , I did not bring you all the way to New York for this . MOTHER I can spell streptococcus . ( She does so . Smiles . Pause . Her daughter brightens. ) p. 6 JANE BUB Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I had my nest of pet scorpions in the bread box ? The air was like nothing I 'd ever seen . A solid crystal , bright as a glass of white gin . Like a moment from long ago frozen solid , squirreled away among scarves and tartans of the family trunk . The one from Mexico , with leather hinges . MOTHER A moment like the one in Bermuda. * Oops . JANE BUB I do not want to talk about Bermuda.I do not want to talk about Bermuda , okay ? It 's just that I do not want to talk about Bermuda . MOTHER A sleep of the tongue . I was thinking about stage blood . Stage blood and Bermuda . Stage blood and Bermuda and men 's clothing . JANE BUB Men 's clothing ? MOTHER Men 's clothing with nothing inside . JANE BUB I wear men 's clothing occasionally . What of it ? MOTHER I was simply making an observation . JANE BUB I wear men 's clothing occasionally . What of it ? Are you trying to pick a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . JANE BUB Are you saying I look mannish ? Is that what you 're saying ? I do not look mannish . These clothes* are good , clean clothes . These clothes are not men 's clothing . They are simple clothes of the most fashionable kind I can afford with a mother in Des Moines in tow who gives one cause to worry , and worse . p. 7 MOTHER Shame , the shame of it . Shame , the shame of it . ( Pause . ) JANE BUB What ? What are you saying ? MOTHER I am saying " shame the shame of it . " To threaten with harm your old woman of a mother . I think it is shameful . JANE BUB I never did any such thing , Mother . ( Pause . ) MOTHER Shame , the shame of it. * ( Under her breath , bitterly . ) Vile , vicious . Bully . JANE BUB I am astounded . I am absolutely astounded . I did no such thing . MOTHER You were thinking of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am thinking of it now , why yes I am , but that is an outcome of the tack you are trying to get me to take . MOTHER ( Under her breath , bitterly . ) Vicious , vile . Bully . ( A shameful pause . ) JANE BUB Mother , I do not think I have the slightest idea what you are driving at . MOTHER ( Not hearing ) Good . I 'm glad . At least on that score . Now what I was thinking was that I know a great deal more about you than you suspect . Certainly more than you ought to suspect . p. 8 JANE BUB I do not want to talk about Bermuda . MOTHER I was not talking about that . JANE BUB You were hinting in that direction . MOTHER I was not . JANE BUB You were too . ( Pause . ) MOTHER I was not . JANE BUB You were too . ( Pause . ) So : just what is it you think you think know ? MOTHER I know you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know too you have a way of touching the nape of your neck . Touching the nape of your neck in moments of emotional crisis . At critical points of crisis , when doom is near . ( Her daughter does this by reflex . ) Touching yourself on the back of your head , on the nape of your neck is an old habit with you , dearie . An old , old habit , I would say . From the season of our salad days , after we had departed Santa Fe but before the clinical terminus . The catastrophe that would lead , lead us that is , would lead ineluctably to Des Moines . And you wore pigtails , and could take on all comers at baseball , darts , checkers . JANE BUB Swimming and diving . p. 9 MOTHER Swimming and diving . And mumbletypeg . JANE BUB Was that Pensacola ? MOTHER That might have been Pensacola . It was the place , I can just barely recall . Sawgrass under the Spanish moss , and up on the limbs of trees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember only the sweetness of those big , pale green grapefruits . Oh yes , Oh Yes , I do . JANE BUB Anyway , that was not an old habit . I formed it recently . It is , I suppose , stress related . MOTHER I have been able to observe the small motions of your soul for all these years . JANE BUB What a thing to say Mother . What a genuinely creepy thing to say : the small motions of my soul ? MOTHER Yes , dearie , yes . That is what they are . Yes , and I have seen you paint your nails for the first time . The first time scarlet . Yes , dearie , yes . Scarlet , for the very first time . JANE BUB Why ? Whatever for ? Why is it these odd and uncomfortable things that you choose to share ? MOTHER Because . JANE BUB And why , why , why do your persist in calling me Sarah when you know I so hate the name ? p. 10 MOTHER ( Icily ) Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can see how angry you are with all the names , some of them not even your own , that you 've soiled . Not my doing , any of it . Who named you , daughter , if not me  --  and and JANE BUB And you ! And so ? What are you saying ? Mother ? MOTHER Only a fool names herself , and arrives by the end of her train of thought at the pure end of the premature . JANE BUB ( Coldly ) Damn you . You hate my youth , my elegance , and yes , my money , because at least I have that . And you never had the wit to care . About money . MOTHER What do you know of what I cared ? I cared plenty . Still do . JANE BUB Oh yeah ? MOTHER Yeah . Plenty . JANE BUB I do n't believe you . MOTHER I do n't give a damn what you believe . JANE BUB That makes two of us . MOTHER Amen . ( Pause . ) JANE BUB ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! How could I be so stupid to end up like this , talking to the crazy , ruined has-been who is my mother on a dull , rusty Thursday a halfmile up over the mist of New York and not go mad myself . p. 11 MOTHER All of you have wanted forever to put me on that drug , Prolapsis or Prolepto-whatsis , but I wo n't , see ? I just plain wo n't . Sure , you 've got the upperhand , I know I know . And do n't count on me taking the easy way out  --  over the rail , over the rail and splat . Because the old harridan ain'ta gon na do it . Nosirree , she 's damned if she 's not . She 's got other plans , and these plans include living forever and winning the lotto jackpot for seventy-five million . ( Doughter whistles . ) Go ahead , laugh . What do I care ? I 've arrived at the calm serenity of wizened maturity . Wizendom . Loss , what do I care ? Hope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ static . A caterpillar of moments , gone moments of what is no more . ( Pause . ) JANE BUB Shall we try again ? MOTHER Why ? JANE BUB Well . I do n't know . Just because . ( A biological pause . ) MOTHER I do n't want to and besides , you made fun of me not five minutes ago for just that circumlocution . JANE BUB What ? MOTHER Because . I said " because . " JANE BUB So ? I do n't remember saying anything in the slightest derogatory. p. 12 MOTHER You would n't . Of course . That 's no surprise . ( Pause . ) JANE BUB Blank . MOTHER Blank ? JANE BUB Yes , blank . I just feel blank . MOTHER What a sad case you are . I feel rich and full and large with hopefulness , blood , and a sense of true being . JANE BUB What 's your secret ? MOTHER Would n't you like to know ? JANE BUB Seriously , where does this sense of true being come from ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ? MOTHER My secret is a chronically faulty sense of spacio-temporal continuity . I do n't care if I behave in ways others consider inconsistent , not holistic , or unself-similar . Naturally this fills me like a a blimp with with a sense of true being . JANE BUB Sometimes I wonder if you 're really my mother . MOTHER Who else would I be ? Why else would I bother , for Pete 's sake ? ( Poor JANE does n't know . ) Yes , I 'm as full of true being as the grapefruits of Pensacola. p. 13 JANE BUB ( Wisfully ) When I was a little girl , a little little girl . Long before the episode of the scorpions , I can recall you telling me stories I loved . I 've never heard stories like the ones you told me then , although those stories troubled me like a stone skipping along over the face of a pond . MOTHER The moment 's ripple . JANE BUB Mainly I do not recall much of the narrative structure , only . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still see the Poor Girl 's purple shoelaces and her blackened tooth that caused her shame , but saved her from the savage Wild Turnip . Each full moon a different turnip , all of them wild . All of them powerfully subject to minima and maxima according to the Handy Tables of G. J. Toomer 's Survey of the Toledan Tables . ( Pause . Both sigh at the thought . ) Or the story about the caterpillar who lived for centuries inside the wooden knee of the Poor Tailor from Milwaukee . The caterpillar who dreamed successively of seven worlds , each more remote than the last , the last unaccountably a world without tailors . Hence caterpillars dozing in their wooden knees . MOTHER Yes , that was a very good one , only you 've missed a few crucial details and have the point of the whole somewhat spavined . ( Pause . ) I never cared much for Jane . As a name . p. 14 JANE BUB Then why was I named Jane ? MOTHER It was n't your Christian name . Your Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea you would use it , respecfully and worshipfully , and not that other , that Jane . JANE BUB But I like to be called Jane . MOTHER That was at the last moment , to fill out the whole . For the legal documents . JANE BUB Well , I like it . MOTHER You would . When I think of Jane , I think of Crazy Jane or Plain Jane . Jane Bub : sounds like a sprain or bellyache . I know more about you than you think . ( Pause . ) MOTHER My word , with all that fog down there it feels like we 're in an airplane . JANE BUB This is my first time up here . MOTHER I first came up here many years ago , during the war . I forget which one . JANE BUB They do run together . MOTHER They do run together to form one long , continuous , murderous , bloody-red splotch . JANE BUB So many dead . MOTHER So pointless . ( Pause. ) p. 15 JANE BUB Not if you died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way . Pointless and obvious at the same time . Funny , in a girl so smart . My , is that a man with wings down there , walking across the cloudtops ? JANE BUB Some kind of a float , looks like . Is n't this a holiday ? MOTHER Veterans Day . I think . JANE BUB Veterans of Foreign Wars . Does that include us ? ( Soundless , dry laughter . ) MOTHER Something like that . How long have we been up here ? One fine , fine thing about tourists in Iowa : there are n't any . Suppose you think I 'm mad . JANE BUB Never crossed my mind . Much . Until now . ( Pause . ) What I was thinking was how much I detest being observed . One thing about Lucent , mostly what I do there I can do unobserved . Unseen . Fractals and Fourier analysis . ( She looks up . ) It is somehow more clean . MOTHER Clean to be unseen . Ha . JANE BUB I 'm not joking , really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what makes you tick . The one , tiny , little fatal brass screw . I hate that . I hate that arrogance of bosses and friends with their long gray fingers you can feel threading the jewels of your dream . Pearls , black pearls of your dream . Long bony fingers up to the knuckle in your ear sockets , poking around in the dull , windy places of your head . Trying to take apart whatever it is you want . p. 16 MOTHER ( Matter-of-factly ) Skin . Human skin . JANE BUB Skin ? MOTHER My Bermuda was Caracas , Sarah . JANE BUB What ? Beg your pardon . MOTHER Caracas . The moment for me came in Caracas , in Venezuela . A place full of parrots and toucans . Caracas stands , for me at least , for depravity . ( Pause . ) Dropeverything depravity . Depravity undraped . JANE BUB You ? MOTHER Depravity , yes . That was my object , although I did not and could not have known it at the time . Surely there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young and so so seeming frail. * Although JANE BUB You ? Frail ? Ha . A mechanized urchin of spring steel , I 'll bet . MOTHER That too , dearie . That too . Still I was true to my nature , and to the clothes I wore . ( Gestures lamely . ) JANE BUB Forget it . Forget it . Just that . That 's all I mean . I should keep my trap shut . MOTHER Feel like someone drove a ten-penny nail through my skull . p. 17 JANE BUB Sometimes when I look at a person in the street , all I see is costume . An arrangement of men 's clothing , more or less coherent with nothing inside . MOTHER This is turning into a cluster headache . ( Pause . Brightening. ) @x Scene rudolf the red-nosed reindeer : JANE 'S MOTHER 'S daughter , JANE BUB , and her friend , JO RUDGE , stand on the observation deck of the World Trade Center . A dark and foggy day with misting rain . JANE BUB Caracas , can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can believe it . Tough old bird , your mom . JANE BUB Medium height , medium build . Murderous eyes . Dressed to kill . Wave in the hair , all the same down to the singleton earring . Black pearl . With a look like murder , or its incubation . JO RUDGE Odd to think of murder in an egg . As a mere chick . JANE BUB No odder than the rest of it , Jo . What 's great starts small . That was Mom 's motto . JO RUDGE Well frankly I do n't understand how you get so theoretical about it . What it 's about is invisibility and how somehow you , Jane Bub , have allowed yourself to be erased . Like a cartoon figure , drawn by a child on a piece of mat paper . Then set aflame and burnt . Ffft . JANE BUB Erased . JO RUDGE Made invisible , by your own choice . Such things , such things happen to women who happen not to be up to a truly responsible and informed choice . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drab . ( Pause . ) Reified . Then erased. p. 19 JANE BUB But I 'm not erased . JO RUDGE You 've been erased , and are now invisible . There is no one standing in your shoes . ( Poor JANE looks down at her shoes . ) Only air . Ffft . JANE BUB Only air and misery . JO RUDGE Do n't feel sorry for yourself . You are n't the first . Nor the only . JANE BUB Look , I do n't know where you get off . I do n't understand your line of reasoning . JO RUDGE I am asserting a fact . It 's a metaphor . JANE BUB Makes no sense to me . I 'm not erased . It 's a silly metaphor if you ask me . JO RUDGE You are invisible . JANE BUB I am not . JO RUDGE You are too . JANE BUB I am not . ( Pause . ) JO RUDGE You have become commodified and reified . You have become invisible . An " it . " From a " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause . ) And I am not talking about Bermuda . JANE BUB And I do not want to talk about Bermuda . p. 20 JO RUDGE I was not talking about Bermuda . JANE BUB You were hinting in that direction . JO RUDGE I was alluding to the event that occurred At Key West , and which you only allude to by the nonce term " Bermuda . " And that is indeed a highly unusual coinage since to my knowledge you have never set foot in the place . ( Pause . ) JANE BUB Have too . JO RUDGE Have not . ( Pause . A sad one . ) JANE BUB Have too . JO RUDGE Have not . ( Pause . ) Ffft . Have it your way then . A martyr to invisibility , ha . You know Bermuda like the back of your hand . You visit the dignitaries of Bermuda on the National Day and take part in the festivities : curling , golf , and clog dancing . You wear the famous shorts of that tribe . And eat of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends of the Imperial Bermudian State . Ffft , I say , Ffft . JANE BUB That is not funny , Jo . Just because I have sometimes shared a confidence somewhat does not mean you have the right to , well , mock me in my disgrace . JO RUDGE You are talking like royalty , Jane . You are talking like a most wonderful machine of contented , well-adjusted visibility when I know otherwise . p. 21 JANE BUB Oh , pooh . JO RUDGE Oh , pooh , indeed . I perceive the true invisibility of Jane Bub . JANE BUB You and Mother both seem to assume you have the right to mechanically bore with drill-bit into the dark part of my mind . The inner recesses . I do n't like that , Jo . I really do n't . JO RUDGE So , you admit . Being visually accountable terrifies you . Admit it , Jane . JANE BUB I admit nothing except an aversion to prying eyes . Particularly when they pry under my lid . My lid is mine alone . Get thee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUDGE You are invisible , it 's as simple as that . JANE BUB I sometimes wish I were , oh how I wish I were . ( Pause . ) I dream my teeth are broken stubs , and click about in my mouth like a pocketful of small change . My heart leaps up and I feel nothing but a wheeze of no hope . Hope gone , and no answer . No answer , but a dream of broken teeth , and down down there beneath that eerie carpet of cloud a hell of what my heart leapt up for . JO RUDGE You 're being romantic . Self-involved . Be tough . ( Pause . ) And it 's like , well , I do n't have any bad things going on in my wretched , dingy sublet of a life , eh ? It 's like , solid old reliable Jo , she 's a pillar of cement when it comes to matters of the fucking heart , eh ? She 's like Miss Moral Center of the Universe and the weight of Atlas is balanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? * Sure , sure , go ahead and deny it , deny all of it . While I spend day after day wilting under the fluorescence at work , totaling up statistics concerning practices so grotesque I break out in hives . And that jerk . You know who . After three bourbons , you ask . After my commitment to the larger things in life . Ideas . Righting certain political wrongs I had nothing to do with . My whole generation a crowd of ciphers , professional weathervanes , asshole-kissers , nerds , carreerist windsocks , hypocrites , emotional dwarves , and the intellectually barren . Paper clips . Hair pins . Used cue tips . ( JANE looks aghast at this . ) Loose-wired has-been and smoke-eating swine , I 'd like to tear the motherfuckers ' face off . The whole bunch . p. 22 JANE BUB Jo , what is it ? Jo , hey , Jo . It 's okay . JO RUDGE After three double bourbons , you ask , what does a face mean ? JANE BUB A face mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much do you have to try to stand face to face , and not lose a chance at something better , you know ? I mean , a person 's face is her own face , and it is so damn easy to lose it . It is so damn , damn easy and you become a stand-in for yourself . Even in the morning after when you stand face to face with whoever you are , in the mirror . Not easy . Not so pleasant . Listen to me , Jane , listen . This is important . This is hard stuff . JANE BUB I 'm listening , Jo , I 'm listening hard . ( A hollow pause . ) JO RUDGE Well I 'm not . Period . I am not ever listening to another godamn thing anybody ever says to me , and do you know why , Jane , do you ? Do you know why ? ( She snorts in disgust . ) You 're just like all the rest . JANE BUB Why do you say that ? JO RUDGE Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone owes me an apology . I ask , with perfect clarity and an open heart , I ask friends and family , all , all of you . I ask all of them to speak when it is apparent these persons have a thing to answer for , out of my interest in their wellbeing . I do this in a spirit of love* yes , love . I ask the hard question and the easy one , out of a spirit of unmotivated , disinterested compassion , and the reply I seem invariably to receive is " because . " p. 23 JO RUDGE It 's because you pry too much . JANE BUB " Because . " JO RUDGE It 's because one senses an agenda . JANE BUB I pry too much ! I pry too much ! I pry too much ! Ha . ( An empty , dead pause . ) JO RUDGE People talk about love when they mean motor oil . People talk about love when they mean epidermis . People talk about love when they mean the unholy dollar . People talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition or surprise even , even disappointment in the face of the callous brute who has shamelessly brutalized them emotionally time and time again over the full , horrid course of a three-hundred and fifty year relationship . People talk about love when what they mean is closer to a hideous , insidious itch . ( Pause . Both are aware of the desire to scratch an itch . But given the circumstance neither one will honor the impulse . ) JANE BUB Do you think it will clear up soon ? It 's supposed to clear up soon is n't it ? JO RUDGE Weathermen are all degraded swine . How should I know ? Fuck the weather , I hate the weather . JANE BUB I like the weather . p. 24 JO RUDGE Let 's talk about something else . Now I 'm in a really foul mood . JO RUDGE I hate the weather.I hate the weather.I hate the weather . JANE BUB And while we are on the subject , I do not want to talk about Bermuda . JO RUDGE I was not talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JO RUDGE I was not . JANE BUB You were too . ( Pause . ) JO RUDGE I was not . JANE BUB You were too . ( Pause . ) JANE BUB Feels like we 're floating above the weather , like witches or crows . Weather of the word . JO RUDGE It 's an ocean we 're in , the weather of words . JANE BUB Nevertheless . Oh , hell , I like it up here . I 'm going to make a point of doing more touristy things from now on . Being in New York . After all , we are located here . JO RUDGE I need sunlight . Otherwise I shrivel up , emotionally . This sucks . I ca n't stand this place when it rains . p. 25 JANE BUB ( Seriously ) Life is good . JO RUDGE Listen to you : life is good . Ha ! What would you know about life , little Miss Precocious . JANE BUB Drank it to the dregs . JO RUDGE Ha . JANE BUB Life is my metier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I make . JO RUDGE Ha . JANE BUB Life is a gift . It is our goldest God-given adornment . JO RUDGE Double ha ! What 's that from ? JANE BUB Great Aunt Dolly . Her branch of the family consorted with snakes and spoke in tongues . Hallelujah . JO RUDGE What is it again ? JANE BUB Life is a gift . It is our goldest God-given adornment . I like the word goldest . JO RUDGE It 's a mystery word . Name ten completely unsolvable mysteries . JANE BUB Any human heart at random . And nine more just like it . JO RUDGE You know that one . Damn . ( A full pause . ) Ten hearts . What 's ten ? Deka . Decem . Dix . Dux . Duck . p. 26 JANE BUB ( Unselfconsciously ) A duck of hearts . JO RUDGE A duck of tarts . JANE BUB A truck of ducks .

That one is truly creepy . p. 27 JANE BUB Great Aunt Dolly 's cousin Vernal . From Cajun country . Down south , way down south . ( JANE recites it primly . Pause . Both sing it perfectly . Both are impressed and pleased with themselves . JO darkens . A chilly and lonesome pause . ) JO RUDGE It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Have a cup of coffee . Cup uh Joe . ( Soundless laughter . ) JANE BUB I feel wretched . JO RUDGE Then let 's go down . Coffee , or a drink maybe ? Cheer us up . A double bourbon . JANE BUB You always get your way . This time you 're not . People like you , people who end all their arguments with the word " because " They are my bane . JO RUDGE Ha . JANE BUB Yes , my bane . JO RUDGE Come on , you 'll feel better once we have our feet on the ground . Real , level ground . Try it . JANE BUB How long does it take , if you leap , if you vault the rail , for you to land ? JO RUDGE ? JANE BUB About eight-and-a-half seconds . JO RUDGE ( Astonished ) How on earth did you arrive at a fact like that ? p. 28 JANE BUB I overheard someone say so .

JO RUDGE and her daughter , LINDSAY , a nasty little girl . The latter surveys the harbor with a smile . LINDSAY RUDGE Someday all of this will be mine . JO RUDGE Lindsay , what an odd thing to say ! LINDSAY RUDGE Nonsense , mother . I am being perfectly rational . I know exactedally what I want and when I go to Groaner University I shall know exactedally what must be done . JO RUDGE What must be done ? You sound like Lenin . LINDSAY RUDGE What must be done to get it . JO RUDGE Admire the view , dear . Stick to that if you do n't mind . LINDSAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult it was to get permission . LINDSAY RUDGE Yeah , yeah . ( Long pause . ) LINDSAY RUDGE Mother , are you a mammal ? ( Pause . ) JO RUDGE Lindsay , can you sense the hugeness of the city ? Volume ? Scope ? Dimension ? Solidness ? Light ? To me , such a view of the city always suggests nothing so much as an illusion . p. 30 LINDSAY RUDGE An illusion : is n't that something that is unreal ? JO RUDGE It is the image of a thing . Something else . But images too possess a certain reality . LINDSAY RUDGE I find what you 've said baffling . JO RUDGE Just remember how beautiful the view is , and that through an act of kindness your mother accomplished the most difficult . For most people , Liberty 's torch is off limits .

I like the small square boxy look of it . I like the idea of roaches cozily lodged within . I like the idea of a whole , new species of roach able to foil our murderous designs . Able not only to foil us , and live happily and contentedly , and to live among our stupid poisons , but also smart enough to fool us. p. 31 JO RUDGE To fool us how ? LINDSAY RUDGE To fool us by pretending to be dead when we drawn near . With our grossness and stupidity and mindless theatrical excess . JO RUDGE Look at the sky . Look at the sea . LINDSAY RUDGE I dislike the sea . It 's a grotesque abstraction . Furthermore , it is not beautiful . The roach motel is beautiful . Boxy and beautiful . JO RUDGE You astonish me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not an ordinary child you may as well know that I am already aware of the fact . JO RUDGE Where did you learn to talk that way ? I am not sure I approve . LINDSAY RUDGE Oh , Mother , may I bring this lovely roach motel home ? I just adore it . JO RUDGE Of course you may not . Put it back immediately , wherever you got it from . ( A chilly pause . Her daughter does as she 's told . Another chilly pause . ) LINDSAY RUDGE You will pay for this , Mother . JO RUDGE Other children understand obedience , and also what the implications of this idea are . LINDSAY RUDGE I am not other children , mother . p. 32 JO RUDGE Oh ? LINDSAY RUDGE No , mother , I am a genius . A genius of childhood and I will not be denied . JO RUDGE ( Suddenly bitter . ) Your time will come . LINDSAY RUDGE No , Mother , not in the way you imagine . JO RUDGE We will see about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought you here in the hope the experience would prove edifying . The world today is a stunned sea bass gasping on the shore , its glimmer fading . Certain old and sacred things , and the reverence which attends upon these mysteries has got broken . Spine shattered , no splint suffices. * Only the visible LINDSAY RUDGE Sham rules , we agree on that . JO RUDGE Shame more than sham , Lindsay . LINDSAY RUDGE Cultural wobble . JO RUDGE Insincerity . LINDSAY RUDGE Denial . JO RUDGE Shame . The shame of it . LINDSAY RUDGE All that , all that out there that you revere in obtuse sentimentality shall fall to me and be mine . I know this for a fact . As surely as the root weevil bores that part of both apple and pear . p. 33 JO RUDGE Do they teach the concept of liberty at that fine school I pay for ? LINDSAY RUDGE What I am talking about has nothing to do with what is taught at school , Mother . As I have explained before , I observe the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and draw my own conclusions . JO RUDGE There is knowledge , and there is killing knowledge . LINDSAY RUDGE My aim is to accomplish something tremendous . JO RUDGE And what of your friends , family ? The community at large . What of me , your poor , old mother ? What will become of me , after I cease my struggle , take up the needle and knitting craft of acceptance ? LINDSAY RUDGE I did not come into the world to bewail my state , nor to lament the lures and veils of appearance to which I 've succumbed . What you say is simply false drivel . It is only meant to manipulate me . JO RUDGE And so what do you do with the human heart ? How do you account for its storms , its Bermudas and Caracases and even its drunken Keys West ? LINDSAY RUDGE That kind of talk is the reason why , even at my tender age , I distrust metaphor . You are fooling with me , mother . JO RUDGE No , no , Lindsay , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . Things you will need to know when you come of age , and are possessed by your alchemical animal body . Possessed and clasped in the vice grip as tightly as we are held today , in Liberty 's forbidden fist . p. 34 LINDSAY RUDGE It is the torch she carries that I shall model my intention upon . The pure light of ultimate reason that shall clear my pathway , and to which alone , in my secret self , I shall pledge allegiance . JO RUDGE If you are so alone , how will you go into the world ? People need other people , for solace , society , friendship , and comforting . LINDSAY RUDGE There are others like me . I know it . JO RUDGE Perhaps . LINDSAY RUDGE I do not care a fiddle for your " perhaps . " I know what I 'm talking about . JO RUDGE Ca n't you see , Lindsay , ca n't you understand . I mean when you perceive all creatured things : mice and kittens , alligators and rhyncocephalians even , bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these and not be seized by the rapture of what is holy ? Ca n't you respond to the holiness that infects the very air we breathe ? LINDSAY RUDGE " Infects " is the right word , Mother , in that locution . JO RUDGE Lindsay , I want to pass along to you what I 've learned , learned from life . Not just my cynicism and heartbreak and tendency to whine ; not just my modest savings and rent- controlled apartment in Murray Hill ; these things do not matter . What matters is is the heart and its dark unfathomableness . What matters is our social vision and human generosity and the willingness to measure one 's reach by lacks . To not indulge one 's instinctual dichotomy to the full furnace blast . To be good , generous , and always considerate . Even of the poor , withered , blasted dolt standing there , there , there below on the street , withering in his rage , at us , in his desperate , irremediable abjection. p. 35 LINDSAY RUDGE Talk turkey , Mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , no , no , no , Lindsay . It is not . Our humaneness is a vast , tentiform spider- thing of inescapable connection . Connection radiating from every point to every other point in the three-dimensional field . LINDSAY RUDGE Rot , Tommy-rot , all of it . As surely as the Venus's-hair has black and shining roots and branches . ( An exasperated pause . ) What you do not comprehend , Mother , is how bogus and sentimental your phoney pipe dream truly is . America hates the weak , Mother , because they are weak ( Mom is stunned . ) America does not wish to hear the cries of the underprivileged , the abject , the unlucky . It has heard all these things for years and years and years and years and years . JO RUDGE But the dream has never been delivered . Once the full plan has been explained to ordinary people they will be able to grasp it . Why we must rebuild our cities and save the snail darter , the spotted owl , and so on . LINDSAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hates all that . America hates all that because all that is creepy and dated and just does n't cut it . JO RUDGE Do n't you want a family , children ? Do n't you want to pass on to the next generation what you care about ? Do n't you want to propagate values you believe in ? p. 36 LINDSAY RUDGE Of course , but I realize there is a duplicity present in all discussions of these things . JO RUDGE Oh ? How do you mean ? LINDSAY RUDGE Just that , you people who claim you care so much for humanitarian causes , we see who you are . We are not so stupid . We watch television . JO RUDGE Who is this " we " ? LINDSAY RUDGE This " we " is me . And people like me . Because we are everywhere , and we are a force that spurns your habit of lies . JO RUDGE Television . So that 's where this comes from . I should have known . Well , Lindsay , television is over for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother , do n't act so simpleminded . Do You really think I have regard for Oprah , or anything but contempt for Friends , Felicity , and David Letterman ? Do you think I am so stupid that I actually buy the manure that they are dishing out ? No , Mother , No . It is like I say : I study the creatures of television , and the fruit of this study shall be my ability to move silently and swiftly . Silently and swiftly through the world of appearances unseen and undetected . In this way I shall achieve my objects . And I shall do this without ever needing to explain or justify my actions , motives , or intentions . In this way I shall be clean , and not subject to the fits of whining hypocrisy and shabby question- begging I see everywhere around me . Do you understand , Mother , what it is I am saying to you ? p. 37 JO RUDGE I know I should 've been more disciplined as far as attending parent-teacher activities at Crown of Briars school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , Mother . JO RUDGE  --   --  LINDSAY RUDGE  --   --  ( Both smile and shrug . Pause . ) The teachers at Crown of Briars are idiots , Mother ; I pay them no mind . JO RUDGE That 's hardly reassuring , Lindsay . LINDSAY RUDGE They 're harmless . Faded liberals , just like you . As surely as the lightning bug Photuris pennsylvanica when squashed leaves a lovely smear of greenish-gold light . JO RUDGE Watch what you say . Watch what you say . A thing said can not be unsaid , an act of the human soul can not be undone . You are getting drunk on sheer possibility . Leave one link out of the chain , and the entire sequence is broken . LINDSAY RUDGE That 's mere Popish fact-twisting . JO RUDGE You are putting me in the state of high dudgeon . LINDSAY RUDGE What is high dudgeon , and if " high " why not low ? JO RUDGE Dudgeon is rage , fury . Righteous indignation . There is no such thing as low fury . ( A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle ? It did , diddle it ? Diddle it ? Diddle it ? p. 38 LINDSAY RUDGE It diddle not . JO RUDGE It did , diddle it ? Diddle it ? * Diddle it ? LINDSAY RUDGE It most certainly diddle not . ( Pause . ) I am thinking about what you 've said . JO RUDGE Good . I hope you manage to think your way out of the intellectual cat 's cradle you 've concocted . LINDSAY RUDGE Then " high " dudgeon is redundant , mother , at least by your reasoning , and you have made an error of language . I like the word dudgeon , and I like even more the phrase cat 's cradle , only , what does it mean ? JO RUDGE It 's a a gizmo made of hands and string . LINDSAY RUDGE A gizmo made of hands and string ? What is that supposed to mean ? JO RUDGE A tentiform structure of string , using the various fingers of the hand as supporting struts . LINDSAY RUDGE You are saying my way of thinking is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JO RUDGE It 's only a figure of speech . LINDSAY RUDGE A lie , you mean . JO RUDGE No , the intention was not to mislead . The intention was to clarify . p. 39 LINDSAY RUDGE Then the intentien failed miserably . JO RUDGE I 'm sorry , Lindsay . LINDSAY RUDGE I forgive you , Mother , if you promise not to do this thing ever again . JO RUDGE I 'll do my best . LINDSAY RUDGE Do better . JO RUDGE I 'll try . LINDSAY RUDGE Trying is not good enough . You must promise . ( Pause . ) JO RUDGE Okay . LINDSAY RUDGE Promise . Say it . JO RUDGE I promise . LINDSAY RUDGE The experience of Singapore has rotted the very pith of your mind . JO RUDGE I do not want to talk about Singapore.I do not want to talk about Singapore.I do not want to talk about Singapore . LINDSAY RUDGE I was not talking about Singapore , I was talking about the way Singapore had rotted your mind , a supposition further confirmed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to talk about Singapore , I do not no want to talk about singapore , * I do not want to talk about Singapore p. 40 JO RUDGE ( Fiercely ) What do you know about any of it ? What ? What do you think people do ? What about my friend Alice , lost in the rabbit hole of her dudgeon ? My dear friend Jane Bub and her mother , what about them ? What do they do ? What about your friends ? Dolly Mitchell and Patty Carmichael , what about them ? And Lindsay Rudge , what in the name of Sam Hill does she do ? LINDSAY RUDGE There is no answer to your question , Mother . Because it is a pointless one . JO RUDGE Senseless , all of it senseless . The dredging up of counterfeit , past selves to be questioned concerning this or that . Their sad lives and accidental and inadvertent wickedness and their witless political betrayals that follow as easily from what they do not accomplish , as from what they do . All of it senseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) LINDSAY RUDGE No , Mother , no . The Republicans are not so dumb as that . Mister George W. Bush Jr . with his glittering eye and that poor , tormented poet Dick Cheney . These people are more intelligent than you imagine . Why should they reveal all they know and all they intend to do before it is come to term . These men know that the majority of people are weak and foolish and do not even have a basic grasp on statistics and the statistical use of numbers . Ordinary Americans are baffled by complex things and only want a strong man to lead them . This is true . You do not understand this fact , and that is why your liberal glory is a faded thing . As superfluous as a billet-doux from the olden days . ( Pause . ) Will the police arrest us if they find us here ? p. 41 JO RUDGE Maybe . Maybe not . Excursioning in Liberty 's arm is a misdemeanor , I believe . LINDSAY RUDGE ( Brightening ) Jail ! We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so nice ? LINDSAY RUDGE It 'll be an experience . Besides , I do n't think jail can be as bad as it is portrayed on television . JO RUDGE Oh ? LINDSAY RUDGE You have your own little room , your own little bed , and your own little toilet . JO RUDGE Would n't you get lonely ? LINDSAY RUDGE Probably . But I would have my fellow prisoners to talk to . We could meet secretly and conspire . We could devise unusual ways to escape . That would be fun . JO RUDGE What of Dolly Mitchell and Patty Carmichael ? LINDSAY RUDGE They would come and visit me in jail . They would keep me informed as to conditions outside . ( Both laugh lightheartedly . Pause . The daughter turns to her mother . ) LINDSAY RUDGE The seductions of the world would lean less heavily upon me , being young . JO RUDGE Callow youth . p. 42 LINDSAY RUDGE Mother , you never answered my question . JO RUDGE What question was that ? LINDSAY RUDGE Are you a mammal ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . LINDSAY RUDGE And father , what was he ? JO RUDGE He was a reptile , dear . A snake . LINDSAY RUDGE I like snakes . What kind of snake was he ? JO RUDGE A beaded snake . LINDSAY RUDGE Are beaded snakes poisonous ? JO RUDGE They closely resemble the coral snake which is very poisonous , but no , The beaded snake is not poisonous . LINDSAY RUDGE How can it achieve its objects in the world and avoid detection if it has no pot of poison ? JO RUDGE Because it resembles the coral snake , all things fear it . LINDSAY RUDGE I like snakes ; snakes are smart . JO RUDGE Yes , they are . ( Darkening . A sough of wind . ) LINDSAY RUDGE Where does the wind go when it gets tired ? p. 43 JO RUDGE It goes to its little wicker basket behind the moon . LINDSAY RUDGE Is there a fuzzy blanket in the wicker basket ? JO RUDGE The fuzziest of the fuzzy . LINDSAY RUDGE As surely as the leaning Tower of Pisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LINDSAY RUDGE But I do n't like the sea . The sea says the same thing over and over again . JO RUDGE Maybe the sea gets restless . LINDSAY RUDGE How can that be ? The sea must have a low IQ . JO RUDGE I 'm not so sure . LINDSAY RUDGE You 're not sure of anything , Mother . JO RUDGE Because I get lonely sometimes . LINDSAY RUDGE I never get lonely . The world is a puzzle and I know how to read it . The world is full of wonderful toys posing as astounding objects . I think the world and me will get along just fine together . JO RUDGE I think you will do just fine also . ( Mom whistles the tune from the little song at the end of the second scene . Pause . ) Do n't you even like the sight of the wind as it troubles the water , over there , by Governor 's Island ? p. 44 LINDSAY RUDGE A little , yes , a little . It reminds me of the moon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon is a place that time left alone . I want to live forever , and be like the moon . A never-never land . JO RUDGE I thought you wanted only to pursue your objects without detection . LINDSAY RUDGE To become the moon is one of my objects , as surely as a cat's-paw is a person used by another . JO RUDGE As surely as a cat's-paw is a hitch made in a bight of rope so that two eyes are formed to hold the hook of one block of a tackle . LINDSAY RUDGE Mother , you are MAD . ( LINDSAY laughs . ) JO RUDGE As surely as a light breeze that ruffles the surface of the water over a comparatively small area . ( Pause . ) LINDSAY RUDGE Mother , I am quite pleased with myself today . Today I have learned a fine , new word : dudgeon . Dudgeon , rage . Righteous indignation . ( Pause . Out of the blue they sing . ) BOTH Don Juan Dudgeon that curmudgeonkilled his wiveshis seven wiveswith five little sticksand a pin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hallway in Federal Superior Court , in Lower Manhattan . JANE 's MOTHER and LINDSAY sit together on a long wooden bench outside a grand jury room . LINDSAY RUDGE My mother is a stupid fool . MOTHER So was mine , so are they all . LINDSAY RUDGE My mother is a greater fool than most . She did n't secure the proper documentation . Now she 's up shit 's creek . MOTHER Up shit 's creek ? My word . LINDSAY RUDGE Exactedally . That is exactedally true . MOTHER How can you be so sure ? LINDSAY RUDGE You do n't know who you 're talking to , clearly . MOTHER I have a pretty good idea . LINDSAY RUDGE Do n't act coy . It 's so foolish . I am aware of the fact you know my name . I was not talking about that . What kind of ninnyhammer do you take me for ? MOTHER Does your mother know you talk this way ? LINDSAY RUDGE What business is it of yours ? ( Pause . ) MOTHER So , I see we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RUDGE Another idiotic euphemism . Phooey . MOTHER Well , I would n't worry . My daughter will explain to the people inside just what they need to know . LINDSAY RUDGE Who is your daughter , exactedally ? MOTHER Jane Bub , Jo 's friend . LINDSAY RUDGE Oh her . And you are her mother ? MOTHER Yes I am . LINDSAY RUDGE What is your name ? MOTHER Why , Mrs. Bub of course . LINDSAY RUDGE No , I mean your Christian name . MOTHER Hildegard , Hildgard Bub . LINDSAY RUDGE I am Lindsay Rudge . MOTHER How do you do , Lindsay ? ( They shake hands . Pause . ) LINDSAY RUDGE This whole day has put me in the state of high dudgeon . MOTHER Do n't worry . LINDSAY RUDGE I am not worried , I 'm bored . And tired . I want to go home . MOTHER How on earth did the two of you get all the way up there , undetected , to Liberty 's torch ? p. 47 LINDSAY RUDGE Mother claimed she had a powerful friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and broke the monster padlock with these . ( Holds up a pair of metal-cutting sheers . ) MOTHER The law does n't bend for anybody . LINDSAY RUDGE  --   --  MOTHER  --   --  LINDSAY RUDGE We did n't break anything . I see no reason for all this pointless rigamarole . MOTHER Well , I would n't worry too much . LINDSAY RUDGE I am waiting for you to offer some proof concerning that . MOTHER Well , Dr. Jane Bub is an expert on the physics of stress . Metal fatigue may not be her specialty , but it is a related discipline . Metallurgy . Airy stress . LINDSAY RUDGE Airy isostasy is one of my favorite things . MOTHER Airy apostasy ? LINDSAY RUDGE Is n't she the one who did n't want to talk about Bermuda ? MOTHER That 's my Sarah . LINDSAY RUDGE It was not our intention to break Liberty 's arm . Surely the grand jury will listen to reason and not spring the trap upon us Rudges. p. 48 MOTHER Sarah will offer evidence , and the bonus of character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Jane . My daughter . LINDSAY RUDGE All this is baffling to me . You Bub people are all crazy , Hildegard . MOTHER Shall I tell a story while we wait ? LINDSAY RUDGE Only if it is not a creepy one . MOTHER Once upon a time there was a LINDSAY RUDGE Hold it . MOTHER What 's the matter ? LINDSAY RUDGE I do n't understand . MOTHER Understand ? LINDSAY RUDGE What you just said . I do n't understand it . MOTHER Lindsay , I have n't got to the story yet . There is nothing to not understand . LINDSAY RUDGE What I do not understand is that non-airy business of " Once upon a time " That is not airy . MOTHER Yes , once upon a time , yes , my dearie , that is the proper way to begin a story . LINDSAY RUDGE Well , I do not understand it . Furthermore , I do not trust it . p. 49 MOTHER What is there in such a harmless phrase to warrant such suspicion . The hideous and scary part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that you can say " once upon it " as though it were a footstool ? It makes no sense . MOTHER Such old things contain the glister of the deepest heartfelt things . LINDSAY RUDGE ? MOTHER What ? LINDSAY RUDGE Such talk gives me the creeps . Are they going to execute Mother by firing squad maybe , or by the garrote ? ( She feigns her own strangulation . ) MOTHER Do you want to hear my story or not ? LINDSAY RUDGE Only if it only if you do not begin with this malarkey of standing on time like it was the back of an elephant . That is not airy . That does not cut it . MOTHER Agreed . No more talk of time 's thinginess . Shake on it ? ( They shake hands . ) Once upon a time , there was a big , round bowl of slobber . ( The little girl rolls her eyes . ) In this bowl of slobber there was a red velvet couch , and upon this couch there lay in gloomy splendor a rosebush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprinkled all over this recumbent rosebush person there were exactedly three hundred and twenty seven crushed Christmas tree ornaments , each one a slightly different hue so that their fragments glimmered with a strangely disturbing luminescence , as with a radiance from another world , a strangely disturbing demented world p. 50 LINDSAY RUDGE I do n't like this story . Can you tell a different one ? MOTHER It is a very fine story , Lindsay . What is it you do n't like about it ? LINDSAY RUDGE There are no people . I should like to hear a proper story . With an interesting person at the very center of it . Perhaps a fine , young little girl , a person rather like me . She should encounter certain obstacles and learn how to overcome them , overcome them with intelligence , bravery and her native perscapacity . She should be rewarded and grow rich and famous . All the evil phantoms of her lonely and wretched childhood  --  a childhood wasted among doltish adults  --  should be utterly dispelled and made to vanish , vanish and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINDSAY RUDGE And be no more indeed . Exactedally . Hildegard , why are you looking at me in that way ? MOTHER I am considering how I should reply . LINDSAY RUDGE What a large and blocky hall this is . Where in the world do they find all this measureless mass of marble ? MOTHER Lawyers have a genius wire that extends deep into the center of the world , and that is where the trolls and cobolds dwell . Not to mention all the dead pandas . Special pandas , sisters under the skin to the notorious March Hare . And a certain very sad , very strange little girl p. 51 LINDSAY RUDGE Really ? MOTHER Yes , really . They go there and release hundreds of a rare breed of bunny rabbit , called the sapphire-tufted coney . It is called that because , of course , of the wiggle-waggle of its bluish ear-flaps . LINDSAY RUDGE Of course , of course . And the little girl ? MOTHER The little girl had somehow gotten lost one fine spring morning as she was collecting empty machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapdragons . LINDSAY RUDGE She was a modern little girl then ? MOTHER A very modern little girl . LINDSAY RUDGE Hildegard I do n't like this story either . MOTHER Why not , Lindsay ? LINDSAY RUDGE It smells wormy . MOTHER Wormy ? LINDSAY RUDGE Yes , it smells wormy with the stench of the pathetic loser and social victim . It smells too of senility 's elegy to itself . It suggests all those tired cliches concerning loss of innocence . Innocence , ha ! ( Pause . Hildegard sits pondering . ) MOTHER Yes , I think they will probably shoot your mother . Tie her to the mouth of a cannon . Blup , blup . Blown to bits . Or poison her with a random overdose of of upas , or foxglove , or belladonna , yes p. 52 LINDSAY RUDGE But we did not break Liberty , nor commit an act of public nuisance upon her person . Liberty 's structural integrity is intact . I 'm very sure of it . MOTHER I 'm not so very sure of it . My daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metallurgical maladies . The frown she wore upon entering the grand jury room was symptomatic . Symptomatic of a crime , my dearie . LINDSAY RUDGE And why this business of " my dearie " ? It makes my flesh crawl . All this " my dearie " business reminds me of the witches of olden times and other even stupider older stuff . Fictional stuff . Pointless lies and bulldiddly . MOTHER It is not bulldiddly . It is a gesture of fun . LINDSAY RUDGE It is not fun , Hildegard , it is bulldiddly . It is pointless . A bad check on the mind 's fiscal resources . ( Pause and a sigh . ) MOTHER So : you do not want to hear a story ? LINDSAY RUDGE Of course I want to hear a story . MOTHER No , I do n't think you do . LINDSAY RUDGE Yes I do . Yes I do . Yes I do . ( Pause and a sigh . ) I diddily do . p. 53 MOTHER You diddily do n't . LINDSAY RUDGE Do . MOTHER Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be situated at the site of truth . The real , I mean . Geographically . And be current , consistent and such that it unfold according to our contemporary notions of fact , reason , and rules of evidence . All this hokey-pocus of " once upon a time " gives me quite a pain . And , as I have said , what is a specific and local time , what kind of thing is it , like a shoe or hat , that it may be " put upon " yet another thing ? And if it is an object like one of these , what sort of thing must it rest upon ? Really ? I ca n't imagine . I ca n't . MOTHER All right , if that 's the way you want it . I shall tell you a story with no once upon a time , but with a local habitation and a name . ( A suspicious pause . ) LINDSAY RUDGE What is the name of its name , and where is its habitation located ? In precise terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for effect . ) It is called " The Story of the Monster Grease Ball that Clogged the Giant Sewer Pipe . " LINDSAY RUDGE Wow . I like it already . Go on . p. 54 MOTHER And it is located in the continuous present at a place called Sparks , Nevada . LINDSAY RUDGE Good , very good . I like the specificity of it ; only is Sparks , Nevada a true place ? Oh , it must be , Hildegard , it must be . MOTHER Yes , Lindsay , it is a very real place . Near Reno and Virginia City . In the vast American desert . LINDSAY RUDGE Go on then . Go on . MOTHER ( Sweetly ) Once upon a time ( LINDSAY frowns. ) oops , sorry  --  operators of the local sewage treatment plant , of Sparks , Nevada , were forced to warn locals not to pour grease down the drain , after a Monster Grease Ball disrupted operations . LINDSAY RUDGE Ooh ooh ooh . MOTHER Sanitary engineer John Gonzales LINDSAY RUDGE We 'll amend that to Lolita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut from a familiar mold . LINDSAY RUDGE A fine mold , Hildegard . Go on . MOTHER Sanitary engineer Lolita Gonzales  --  that 's her real name  --  reports that the 150 pound monster has lodged against a bar screen at the plant . It is the 4th of February , 1996 . The Monster Grease Ball is causing sewage to back up , can you imagine . Now , it is taking some twenty sticky minutes to dislodge and remove the terror of its greasy bulk p. 55 LINDSAY RUDGE Oh , I like the bulkiness of it . Oh . MOTHER Lolita explains that it looks like a side of bacon and so she nicknames it the Grease Bison . Now employees are using pitchforks to remove it , now they are hauling it to a nearby dump . LINDSAY RUDGE Wow . What dump ? MOTHER The one at Dewlap , Nevada . ( But she 's making it up . LINDSAY narrows her eyes . ) " There 's no telling where it came from , " Lolita says . " What people should do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it congeal and throw it away . Grease is a serious problem ; do n't put it down the drain . " LINDSAY RUDGE That must be the moral of the story . MOTHER Now Lolita is urging residents to get rid of their kitchen garbage disposals , saying they 're a major source of sewer-line grease . ( Our LINDSAY beams . ) The bar screen that caught the Grease Bison is used to keep objects such as sticks and rags out of the sewage system . ( She leans over LINDSAY and whispers into her ear . ) Rings and dentures also have been known to lodge against it . LINDSAY RUDGE Wow , Hildegard . That is the most wonderful story I have ever heard . p. 56 MOTHER Hot off the AP wire . Real life , factual . A slice of the bacon of life . LINDSAY RUDGE The people felt so real , not like the corny constructed people in children 's books . And edifying too , without being an insult to one 's perscapacity . It is , as far as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you Hildegard . Oh , please tell it again . ( She sees JANE and JO over JANE 's MOTHER 's shoulder . The latter , however , does not . ) MOTHER The Story of the Monster Grease Ball that Clogged the Giant Sewer Pipe JANE BUB Mother what is this ? LINDSAY RUDGE Oh , mother , mother , Hildegard has told me the most wonderful story . And it is a true one . JO RUDGE She has , has she . MOTHER Right off the AP wire . From Sparks , Nevada . LINDSAY RUDGE A 150 pound " Grease Bison " had to be removed with a pitchfork . Wow . JANE BUB I am surprised , Mother , you have been up to your old tricks . Are n't you aware of the gravity of the situation ? MOTHER What 's wrong with a little harmless distraction ? * What 's wrong with that ? p. 57 JO RUDGE Oh , Lindsay dear , Mom 's coming home . There is n't going to be any indictment . Mother 's going free . LINDSAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scot free . Truly . Jane Bub has saved the day . It 's a complete miracle . Tell us , Jane , tell us how you did it . MOTHER I can just imagine , my dearies . JO RUDGE Hush now , Mrs. Bub , your daughter convinced the grand jury of our innocence . LINDSAY RUDGE " Our " innocence , Mother ? Surely you are not implicating me , your own child , in your crimes ? Crimes against the state . And the structural integrity of Liberty 's arm . JO RUDGE Lindsay , stop this . LINDSAY RUDGE Mother , I do n't want to be implicated in your idiotic choices . JO RUDGE And I am coming to believe you are one of the most . Idiotic , that is . LINDSAY RUDGE I am not a choice of yours , mother . I am an event all of my own . Do not confuse me with you . You with your Bermudas and Acapulcos and whatever the hecks . I just happened . We are not the same . JANE BUB I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about Bermuda.I do not want to talk about Bermuda.I do not want to talk about Bermuda ; and furthermore , if that child of yours starts talking about Bermuda I am going right back into that grand jury room and tell Assistant District Attorney Hoskins Carmichael* that I have perjured myself and and that you , Jo , the apparently innocent Jo Rudge , are in fact  --  p. 58 LINDSAY RUDGE Can we leave this place I 'm getting hungry . ( JANE stifles an angry response , then begins to speak with calm assurance . ) JANE BUB Well I presented the facts clearly to the assistant district attorney : first outlining the forces identified as stress , whether tensile , compressive , or shearing , according to the nature of the straining action.I supplied graphs and appropriate diagrams.Using Mohr 's Circle , I succeeded in demonstrating beyond a doubt that the strain energy per unit stored in Liberty 's arm in no way reached the upper yield point for strain hardening . Not to mention necking , and fracture . The stress within Liberty 's arm remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per unit volume . ( Pause . Then applause . ) Like you they applauded . And ushered the two of us out , Jo and me I mean . Triumphant . I did not even need to mention airy stress function , nor the fact that Assistant District Attorney Carmichael 's daughter , Patty , is a classmate of one Lindsay Rudge at Crown of Briars School . It seemed , at that point , superfluous . LINDSAY RUDGE By airy stress function you are referring to the biharmonic function of two variables whose second partial derivatives give the stress components of a body subject to stress ? p. 59 JANE BUB Precisely . LINDSAY RUDGE Then , Miss Bub , I apologize for my insensitivity and promise never again to refer to that subtropical archipelago formerly ruled by Sir John Swan where you suffered your Fall . MOTHER Doom . Doom . JO RUDGE But at least I am free . LINDSAY RUDGE One thing I mean to ask you , Mother . In the event of an indictment , am I to understand it was your intention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lindsay , to smooth the way for your release by some act of bribery involving my best friend , Patty Carmichael , daughter of Assistant District Attorney Hoskins Carmichael and incidentally a classmate at Crown of Briars . JO RUDGE Lindsay , it never crossed my mind . ( Pause . ) LINDSAY RUDGE I would be vexed if it were to be the case , Mother . Very vexed . JO RUDGE Do n't worry , dear , do n't worry . There is nothing to be vexed about . Wow , I could use a stiff drink . I know a nasty little bar down on Columbus Park . It 's called Winnie 's . LINDSAY RUDGE I do n't suppose you remembered to ask concerning my roach motel . p. 60 MOTHER You had a roach motel ? Wonderful . LINDSAY RUDGE Yes , I discovered a wonderful roach motel in Liberty 's arm . Mother , in her predictable way , made an issue of it . Only , without her knowledge , I managed to secret it , here , upon my person . At home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gone , later . Agents of mother no doubt found it , and brought it here , to turn it in as evidence . Evidence against me . And it was the most perfectilius roach motel . MOTHER How sad . JO RUDGE Come on , Lindsay . Let 's get going . LINDSAY RUDGE So you did not ask the assistant district attorney as I requested ? JO RUDGE Quite slipped my mind , Lindsay . MOTHER Perhaps I can find you another roach motel . LINDSAY RUDGE It would n't be perfect like the one I found in Liberty 's torch . JANE BUB She 's so cute . JO RUDGE Do n't let her hear that . MOTHER Yes , Lindsay I can send you one even more perfect than the one you lost . LINDSAY RUDGE Hildegard , whose side are you on ? p. 61 MOTHER Hush , hush . We 'll fix all this silliness , just the way Lolita Gonzalez did . With her pitchfork , at the sewage treatment plant in Sparks , Nevada . LINDSAY RUDGE Well , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just because I am young and small . JO RUDGE And powerless , Lindsay , remember that . Powerless . Hopelessly dependent on the kindness of her mother . LINDSAY RUDGE Mother , your attempt at wit is grotesque . JANE BUB Lindsay , tell me what the " airy points " are . Then we 'll all go to Winnie 's for a drink . After that we 'll go to Chinatown . Green tea ice cream all the way around . LINDSAY RUDGE Pooh on Winnie 's . ( She refuses . ) JANE BUB Let 's hear about those airy points . ( She refuses . ) JO RUDGE She has n't been this bad since well since LINDSAY RUDGE It was the time of Acapulco , Mother . And I came through the crisis unaffected , quite unruffled , despite all the general hysteria . You , Mother , on the other hand : a total basket case . ( Her mother turns away . ) Exactedally , Mother , your introjects came unstuck . Pathetic . p. 62 JO RUDGE ( Turning back in a fury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Hildegard , would you like a stick of gum ? ( She offers . JANE 's MOTHER takes it . ) Jane ? JANE BUB Sure . ( She takes a stick . LINDSAY does not offer one to her mother . ) MOTHER What about your own mother ? LINDSAY RUDGE She has put me into a state of high dudgeon over this roach motel issue . I am thinking of what former Senator Bob Dole would do in my place . ( Pause . ) JO RUDGE Well Lindsay , what do you think he would do ? Mister Dole . That lugubrious , snake-oil charmer ! What ? LINDSAY RUDGE I do not think he would give you a stick of gum . JO RUDGE We 're going then without you , Lindsay . LINDSAY RUDGE Fine , I am beginning to like this place . It is boxy and large . With vast blocks of anti-theatrical stone all around . It feels reliable and solid . It is full of the feeling of what 's real . In fact , I like it very much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay here forever . p. 63 JO RUDGE She likes being in the catbird seat . LINDSAY RUDGE Tell Mother the state may have let her off gently , but not me . JO RUDGE We will negotiate this , Lindsay . LINDSAY RUDGE You need to establish a system of priority among your projects , Mother , and then go after them one at a time . JO RUDGE ( Aside ) I 'm going to commit a violent act ( Turning back . ) I 'm going to count to ten first , and then I 'm going to commit a violent act . MOTHER If you come along I 'll tell you my favorite story , the story of what the glass eyeball had to say to the moon . JO RUDGE One . Two . Three ( All smile . Pause . All go out. )                                          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
