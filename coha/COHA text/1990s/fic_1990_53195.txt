Dolores meets the African boy in a tourist restaurant called The Yoghurt Inn . She is sipping a cold lemon juice , despite her vow to avoid drinks made with unboiled water , and trying to read The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat . It is extremely hot and humid . Before she collapsed in the bamboo-filtered shade of the flowery patio , she walked a bit beyond it , looking for a less touristy place , one without a quaint wooden sign inviting her to " Pop In for a Cold Drink and Some Yoghurt . " But she found no more restaurants on the town 's main street . Farther on , the low houses were made of stone instead of the heavily textured coral rag that composed the Swahili island 's historic buildings . These ordinary houses shrunk down convoluted passageways , where pigs ran loose and chickens scratched and the local people stared , but did not see her . <p> The boy is a waiter at The Yoghurt Inn . He serves her drink with an elaborate gesture , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chases the chicken that has penetrated the patio 's bamboo fence  --  draped with fluid vines of bougainvillea . Despite the absence of distractions in the empty restaurant , Dolores finds it difficult to read . Her attention is divided between a restless feeling of dissatisfaction and the young African waiter , whom she would scarcely notice , except for the fact that even with his white-shined back turned toward her , he makes it clear that he notices her . Chicken banished , he waits alertly on the sidelines for her to finish her drink . His narrow hand extends from the cuff of his shirt , and his long fingers close carefully around the empty glass 's sweating exterior . She asks him to bring her another juice , tamarind this time . <p> Dolores had been on the remote East African island for a day and a half . Her guidebook had recommended it as " that romantic side street , The Isle of Love . " It had not been easy to get to this place  --  nine hours of unpaved road on a crowded bus that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rough voyage on a crude , motorized barge , listing beneath the weight of produce and too many passengers . At first , with its donkey traffic , pitted , color-washed walls , and minimal electricity , the island had seemed a sultry , atavistic place with vaguely frightening possibilities . She had arrived in the evening , and after checking into an inexpensive guesthouse , walked along the waterfront in the sensuous dusk . As the wind rose , the Indian Ocean tongued the hulls of the wooden chows pitching on the thin horizon line that taped land to water . When the light sunk into a weightless cobalt medium , she felt her way into the darkened town , where Muslim women , gripping the veils of their black boui bouis between their teeth , hurried toward the carved wooden doors that had sanctified their mysterious female life for centuries . She found herself racing behind their vulture-shaped shadows , her feet drumming hollow notes from the dense , pockmarked stone , suddenly unnerved by the close , poorly lit streets  --  reeking of unfamiliar sweetish flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel , she was stopped by a sobbing , chanting Arabic music , a dervish 's transcendent whirl . The compelling strength of the hysterical , high-pitched singing , ejected from the cloth-covered doorway of a low stone house , pinned her up against a wall . The house , the island itself , seemed too small to contain such a song , if you could call it that  --  a cramped , shuddering , unsatisfied expulsion . Her head was too small to contain it ! Later , she lay in her bare , white room , beneath the skylit gauze of a mosquito net , breathing heavily . The wind banged the shutter closed then yanked it open again . After a month in Africa , she thought , she had arrived in a place where it might be possible to have a significant experience , to reach , however briefly , to the core of its life . <p> But exactly what experience ? she wonders now , turning a page of words that had not achieved meaning . What in Kenya had she wanted , and failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tangle of thorn , four feet gathered in a motionless point , a phalanx of running giraffe , superimposed on the base of a volcano , a glittering desert-bound lake : these sanitized visions , viewed from the window of a safari van , were as tasteless and odorless as a film of Africa . When the lights flicked back on , she found herself in front of hotel mirrors that reflected unchanged images of herself , or in safe , predictable tourist restaurants , like The Yoghurt Inn . <p> On her organized tour to Lake Turkana , the driver had stopped to greet a white man trudging along an unpaved road in the midday heat ; he wore a heavy leather jacket and carried no water . The driver had said that this crazy mzungu periodically " went bush , " or wandered unarmed and unequipped into whatever part of the country he happened to find himself . Once he had walked for days , and could not build a fire , or lie down to sleep , because two lions were following him . That , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to escape the movie , vanish into the bush , and walk all night , stalked by lions , emerging as someone or even something else , larger , fiercer , the color of dust . She had wanted to be transformed by the unfamiliar reality of this intense , foreign place . Obviously , she had asked too much of Africa , or of herself . <p> In the morning , the Swahili island 's possibilities had retreated behind its impenetrably quaint historic facade , and she was a typical tourist again . She walked up and down the main street , exploring the circuitous maze of thickly walled alleyways behind the market , stopping to take some photographs . She visited the museum , once a rich Portuguese merchant 's house , and circled the 16th-century Arab fort , presently under restoration . Shopkeepers , wearing white embroidered kofia hats , watched her unemotionally , sizing up the potentiality of her displaced American wealth . " Jambo , " they saluted her softly . " Habari yako ? Come in . You are wel-come . " From one she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb that translated : " Take care of yourself . " She ate lunch in another tourist restaurant , its walls decorated with antique ebony combs . After that , there was nothing left to do but go to the beach  --  a forty-five minute walk in the direction of Shela , a crumbling , white town with a 19th-century mosque , distinguished by a unique , conical minaret . Along the ocean , reduced by noon sun to a sluggish lapping , she found bits of antique blue-and-white Chinese pottery , a legacy of the old Arab seaport 's history of commerce , as her guidebook predicted she would . Across the bay , the island of Manda shone like a platinum disk , flat edges quivering in the kiln of equatorial sunlight . Even blotted by sunglasses and a hat , the sky was blinding . She spread her towel beneath a ledge of shale . A fat Swahili man , wearing a striped kikoi , walked by her prostrate form and stopped . " Jambo ! " he greeted her unctuously . " My name is Mohammed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I work at the big hotel . " He gestured toward Shela . " I give massage . " He looked at her torso appraisingly . " I can give special massage . No problem . Hakuna matata . Ask for Mohammed . Anytime . " <p> On her way back to town , she rested in the shade of a stunted , umbrella-shaped tree . A veiled goatherd begged a cigarette by making imaginary puffing motions , then stretched forth a henna-decorated hand . Everyone here wants something , she thought , wishing that what she wanted was as easily defined and as possible to get as money , a massage , or cigarettes . <p> It is now five o'clock . The town 's twenty-six mosques call the faithful to God with a blurry , sore-throated cry that sounds like amplified pain or sex . The Muslim world topples into an ecstatic swoon or prayer , while an American tourist , fated to return to New York the same , almost middle-aged , unsatisfied adventuress she was when she left , sips a tamarind juice and struggles to focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she smiles at the boy , he judges that the time is right to approach her . His steps toward her table are cautious and slow ; the weight of his nervous smile tips back his head . He asks her , Please , what is she reading ? She hands him her book , and he slowly recites , " The man who mix-took his wife for a hat . " Then he laughs . The man has mix-taken his wife for a hat ? Sure ! Can she please explain to him the meaning ? Speaking slowly , using simple phrases , Dolores delivers a short explanation of a neurological disorder , as she understands it  --  barely  --  herself . The boy continues to smile , standing upright , arms akimbo . His dark brow furrows . He is not a native of this island , she thinks ; his skin is black and his features , though well-molded , lack the refined Swahili cast . He places the book down on the table , his fingers lingering on its glossy cover . " I wish , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Other customers enter the restaurant and he excuses himself . As he walks away , his shoes , made out of a hard , rubbery material , appear to hurt his big feet . <p> The next morning the shuddering cry of the twenty-six mosques and the heat awake her . She is already sweating . The rooftop cistern that feeds the bathroom faucets is almost empty ; she washes with a few sparse drops , then goes to The Yoghurt Inn for breakfast . What will she do today ? Perhaps she should check the flight schedules to Nairobi . The aimlessness of tourism is starting to depress her ; all she does is make plans to get to one place , and then , to leave for the next . Mentally she computes the time left in her African vacation . When she thinks of home , she envisions the warped , red vinyl asphalt floor in the kitchen of her small New York apartment where she lives alone . Despite the parties and gallery openings she attends , her elegant wardrobe , her friends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckling , scarred floor seems a metaphor for a life that begs for replacement . <p> The African waiter approaches her table , wearing the same white shirt , tan pants , and painful shoes as the day before . He appears clean and neat , but when he is close enough to touch , she sees that his shirt cuffs are frayed and his pants are threadbare . He walks slowly , pinching the menu between the tips of his long , tapered fingers with cautious firmness , as if it were a butterfly , straining to flutter away . " You have come , " he says , " to take your breakfast ! " He smiles with nervous joy . She orders a banana pancake , tea flavored with cinnamon and yoghurt , although it is already almost too hot to eat . <p> He receives her order attentively , then stands mesmerized . Heat eddies around his stillness , like water around a half-submerged stone . " My name is Nicholas , " he tells her , then waits uneasily . <p> " Pleased to meet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She makes it a point to be friendly and polite to local people . <p> Pressing his palms together , as if praying , he gives a speech . He was born on this island . His parents had a little farm . He gestures . Toward Matondoni . They were growing vegetables and mangos . But then they moved to Kilifi , on the coast , where is from his tribe . He is Giriama . <p> " Then you must speak a different language than they do here , " Dolores states academically . <p> " Yes . I speak Giriama . " The boy takes a breath . " I will like to show you these farms . " He inclines his head toward the inland direction . " It is beautiful that way . That way there are big trees . It is green . " <p> Dolores toys with her book . To escape the town 's restrictive maze is appealing . But what would it mean to go off into the wilds with this naive young waiter ? What would he want from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the past , brief romantic interludes with exotic men had provided the significant experience of her foreign trips ; but now she was  --  or soon would be  --  too old for that . In fact , she had come to Africa partly to redefine her idea of romance . In any case , this boy seems nice , and harmless enough . It could n't hurt to get to know him . <p> " Maybe I can see you later , " he offers quickly . " Later , I have a break . At that time , I am permissioned to leave the restaurant . " <p> " Maybe , " she answers . <p> After breakfast Dolores thinks , Why not walk to the interior by myself ? She does n't really need a guide . Perhaps she can get as far as Matondoni , a village on the other side of the island , where , according to her guidebook , traditional craftsmen build the chows . The big hotel runs donkey tours there , but she has already had her fill of tours  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea how many kilometers it is to Matondoni , but the island is small , it ca n't be far . She is so excited about this solitary excursion into unexplored territory that she forgets to stop back at the guesthouse for her sunblock and hat . She asks the way , and begins to walk . But the Matondoni road , which is supposed to lead straight out of the town , ends abruptly in a porous wall , crumbling beneath a tangled vine of purple flowers . She must have misunderstood the directions . She tries another street , overhung by a ponderous stone arch , and inexplicably ends up in the center of town , back at the market . She asks directions again , and again is directed to the Matondoni road , easy to find , there , down that alley , behind that shop . The winding maze of stone weaves complex corridors into and over one another . Landmarks dissolve before they are marked . Sun-bleached pastel houses shrink behind indistinguishable wooden doors . A black figure appears at the end of a tubular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lighted aperture . She passes an ancient Swahili man , dozing on a porch . Certain that she is walking straight ahead , she arrives back at the dozing man , then slams into the same cracked wall , seething with magenta flowers . A donkey pulling a heavily loaded wooden cart presses her into the roughly textured coral rag . A fly pursues her , its buzz supersonic in the syrupy light . An open sewer trickles down a narrow stone path to the alley behind the Arab fort , a few steps from the central market , exactly where she started out . Now it is too late to set off on any major hike . The sun is high , her skin , a lake of oily sweat . She feels faint , or sick . Tomorrow she will get up early , pack some fruit and Halazoned water , find out how far the village is , and ask the waiter to draw a map . <p> Deprived again of significant experience , she wanders irritably in and out of the same main street shops . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a polished dowry chest and picks up a brightly painted wooden eye , designed to help the chows " see " perilous rocks . When she turns , she finds herself pinpointed by the intense gaze of the nervous boy , who holds an old-fashioned black camera in a leather case . " I have come out to take a few pictures , " he says , breathing quickly . " On my morning break . I saw you here . " <p> Weird , Dolores thinks . He is following me , posing as another tourist . But why ? To make it seem as if they have something in common ? Oddly , she is touched by that . " Oh , " she says . " That 's nice , I guess . " <p> The boy moves closer . Even in this relentless heat , his skin , molded to his bones with the smoothness of rubber , does not perspire . " I want to show you the farms , " he says . " Inside the island . Away from the town . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then suddenly he makes another proposition . " Beyond the restaurant there is a beach . On the other side . The tourists do not know it . It is quiet there . Wo n't you , " he asks , " come there with me ? " <p> That afternoon , Dolores accompanies the African waiter to his private beach , shielded from the sun by a long , striped caftan , sunglasses , and a wide-brimmed straw hat . The sweaty trek is not picturesque . Beyond the historic buildings and the ordinary people 's street , they pass the slaughterhouse ; dingy , black Marabou storks wait in the muck outside , opening their raw , featherless throats in hope of butchered scraps . Farther on , a jungle of thorny trees balances on twisted talon roots in the mud of a tide-drained swamp , swarming with gnats . Unencumbered except for a roll of towel , the boy runs lightly up a hill of burning sand . She wishes that she had worn her sneakers instead of rubber thongs . Her heavy daypack , stuffed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat , yanks her backwards . With a cautious gesture , he takes her hand . She notices , without surprise , that there is emotional power in this casual touch . <p> The beach is not as beautiful as the one at Shela . The sand is brownish instead of white ; humps of rock and seaweed flotillas mar the shallow flow of tide . They spread their towels in the ragged shadow the sea wall of an unoccupied villa casts . <p> " Who owns this mansion ? " Dolores asks . <p> " I do not know , " he answers . " But he is very rich , I think . Not like me . " Then he laughs . <p> " Or me ! " Dolores adds . <p> Turning his back , the boy disrobes . Apparently his thin cotton underwear doubles for swimming trunks . He lies beside her , self-conscious about his long-boned , almost naked body , his oversized hands and feet . There is not much space between pores in the thin , convex planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seldom see such a dearth of flesh , Dolores thinks , wondering when , and exactly why , she became aware of his awkward , compressed grace . Her skin , next to his , looks unhealthily soft and white . The perimeters of their arms and ankles touch . Maybe she is suffering from a touch of sunstroke ; she does n't feel very good . Though it would be logical to sleep or talk , they lie alertly silent , rigid , conscious of the edges of their bodies , cooler than the penetrating heat . " Will you , " he finally asks , " teach me how to swim ? " <p> Later they lie as close as possible beneath the wall . He shivers in his wet underwear , now heavy and opaque . She argues with herself : You ca n't get involved with a boy like this , a waiter . She doubts that he perceives her age ; so far , most Africans have taken her for younger . She wonders if Africans kiss ; she has heard that they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white people do . She notices his lips , their orchid fullness . <p> He lifts her wrist and examines her watch , running his fingers over the face that has collected beads of moisture , stroking its cracked blue leather strap . It is time to go back to the restaurant , he says . They both dress hurriedly . He stares as she ties her Indian cotton harem pants , patterned with gaudy metallic stripes , over her bathing suit , then reaches out , as if to take possession of a glowing element . " In town , the men feel envy in their hearts , because I walk with a woman wearing such beautiful trousers , " he tells her . Dolores looks down at the flimsy cheap pants , packed mainly because they needed no ironing , and smiles to herself . <p> On the way back to town she begins to feel queasy . The dazzling sunlight slows her down . Her stunned eyes follow his dark body , contracting like a shadow of itself . On the hill of burning sand , a thorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzy a bit . " Oh , I am sorry . . . " he says . The insignificant puncture is bleeding profusely ; red plasma turns black in the color-stripping glare . He removes the thorn with fingers guided by a liberated gentleness that must be quintessentially African in its instinct to cure by touch , and supports her with his long hand , smeared with her blood , as she hops awkwardly along on one foot . Then he asks , almost with expression , " Can we stop here together ? On the way back there is a place . In the swamp . Behind the trees . " <p> That night Dolores waits for the boy in a small Swahili restaurant on a back street . The cinnamon-flavored tea she drinks smells like the pungent sandalwood oil she dabs on herself to conceal the smell of her anxious sweat , and tastes like the trickle of open sewers , the cloying sweetness of waxy jasmine . Drugged , buzzing flies congeal in a sticky film on the table 's scarred wood . To copulate like an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the primitive idea , so sexually abandoned , the innocent boldness of the request , intrigued her profoundly . The mosques ' amplified moan mingles with a donkey 's braying . She continues to argue with herself : Maybe this is the best you can do  --  know a single African , however briefly . To be " stalked by lions , " or whatever that image represented , is , for her , a myth . <p> The boy led her out of the town 's stone streets , through a maze of soft sand pathways , lit only by the sky 's blue glow , which made dark solids gleam , and displaced the outlines of paler shapes . Gelatinous forms , probably cats , dissolved through alleyways and the yards of low shacks . She had never realized that the town was so large , spread so far away from its historic center . At one point she lost her nerve and asked , " Where are we going ? " although she knew . They finally reached a low concrete building with rooms off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is known as " quarters , " she thought . He unlocked a door , and in the quivering wedge of light , she saw a bed , nothing more . He shut the door . The room folded in , as dark and airless as a closet stuffed with sun-bleached bones and some pungent , half-dried vegetable matter . It smells , she thought , like Africa  --  the Africa she had n't felt . <p> The boy 's desire had been gracious and slow , more ponderous than the spare body it occupied with a sure-footed , lethargic power , yet removed from it , like a large tusked animal seen through binoculars on the horizon . After the second time , he had said that he loved her , and with troubled urgency , asked her if she loved him . She had answered , " Of course , " although the question was disconcerting : Love was not a word she would have normally used in a situation like this . Then she had felt uncomfortable , jaded ; a naive African boy  --  who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies on his back . He had wanted sex again , but she had said no ; maybe later . Suddenly her body aches all over ; she feels as if she might get sick . Though the crude , wooden shutters are unbolted , not a draft stirs the humid capsule of much-breathed air . He does n't seem to notice the mosquitos that bite without a warning whine , then circle somnambulantly , bloated with blood . No net tents in the bed . He has already told her that the island 's mosquitos are too " weak " to transmit malaria ; she thinks , I bet ! He gets up , still hugely naked , and wraps his sharp-boned hips , as narrow as a dancer 's , in a faded kanga . " I go out to bathe , " he informs her , then pulls a string that hangs from the ceiling and turns on the light . <p> In the flickering low wattage from the bulb , Dolores is abruptly confronted with the dismal room . Apart from the bed ( a slab of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no other furniture . A low wooden stool doubles for a table . The shirt and trousers that he always wears hang on a nail in the wall , soiled with dried , bloody splotches , rusty stains , and crumbling gouge marks from previous nails . Another , even shabbier pair of pants is folded on top of the stool , and his hard rubbery shoes are placed precisely beneath it ; one of the uppers , she sees , has split away from the sole . There are none of the usual bedroom appliances  --  no alarm clock , no radio . A cheap English mystery novel , some tourist 's discard , lies facedown on the floor , pages bent . There is no sign of the camera he carried in the woodcarver 's shop ; to impress her , he must have borrowed it . Through the thin wall , she hears voices , arguing in a shrill African language , the sound of a rewinding tape , then music , fractured by blaring static . The unpainted concrete floor is gritty beneath her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flee . It is not so much that the room is poor  --  she has visited poor people 's homes before , if not for the same reason  --  but that it communicates a claustrophobic , terminal fate , an old man 's hopelessness , though the boy is young . The room makes her feel sorry for him , and because of her sorrow , ashamed and guilty , as if she has entered it to steal or spy . This time , she thinks , she has gone too far , crossed a closed boundary into forbidden territory , where much could go wrong . She could leave before he returns from his bath , run back to her peaceful , clean guesthouse ; no one will ever guess she was here , and time will erase the memory of it all , as it would a dream that reveals a desire the dreamer would rather not know she had . She jerks her T-shirt on inside-out , and locates her underpants , crumpled into a moist , richly silk ball in the depths of the torn sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightest idea where she is right now , or how to retrace her steps through the vertiginous streets . <p> When the boy comes back in , his taut , bare chest glistening with drops of water from the cistern , he finds her semi-dressed , examining the room 's only item of decoration  --  a framed diploma on the splotchy wall . Keshar Nicholas Ogembo , this document testifies , graduated from the St. Bartholomew Mission School in Kilifi with training in sign painting . Beside the gold seal , there is a photograph of the boy , younger face less definite , awkwardly posed . The frame is dusty , and across the glass zigzags a violent crack . <p> He watches her carefully . Sensing desertion , he takes in his breath , and places his delicate , long fingertips over his heart . <p> " I was thinking that maybe I should go back now , " she ventures . " They may wonder where I am . . . at the hotel . " <p> " No , " he tells her . " They know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes on the pathetic cracked diploma . What should she do ? She does n't want to hurt him ; her bad judgment is not his fault . She has come this far ; maybe now she has to spend the night . " Your first name is not really Nicholas ? " she asks , buying time , immobilized by his unhappy gaze . <p> " It is Keshar , " he answers with a sober dignity that comes from a cleaner , more opulent space . " That is my African name . " A water bug , the size of a mouse , plunges from the unpainted rafters and hurtles across the floor . <p> The next day Dolores joins an Australian couple on a fishing trip to Manda . She does n't eat breakfast at The Yoghurt Inn , as she promised she would . She hopes that a typical tourist agenda will help her forget the previous night  --  an embarrassing mistake , inspired by sunstroke . She has slept with someone she should n't have slept with ; well , it is n't as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wind-bloated sail of the chow , the thrill of drawing a real fish from the fluidly bucking Indian Ocean , she ca n't shake the hopelessness of that desolate room , where , in the end , she endured a sleepless , self-reproachful and paranoid night . <p> Before he slept , oblivious to the fetid heat , the attacking mosquitos , and the scuttling of giant dry-shelled roaches , the boy had told her about his life . He had been trained as a sign painter at the mission school , as the diploma told , but on the coast , there were no signs to paint . So he had come to this island to become a waiter . He arrived at the restaurant at six A.M. to prepare for breakfast and stayed until ten at night . All day long he took no food . He got paid 500 shillings a month , little , sure , and tips were bad ; these foreign peoples were very selfish , especially the French . In Ramadan , when the restaurant shut , he went to Kilifi to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to her he gave , and also to his brother , who was not working . He wished to go to another school and train in electricity , but he could not save the tuition money . His room was costly and he had to eat . One day he would leave this place ! Go to America ! He laughed . On his day off , he had nothing to do . Usually he stayed in his room , doing nothing . It was . . . he searched for the word . . . bored . He had no radio or tape deck . " But now , " he had said , extending his fingers toward her in the stifling blackness , " I have met you . " To all of this she listened uneasily , making indignant or sympathetic sounds , thinking , What am I doing here , with him ? <p> After the fishing trip , she dined at Sinbad 's , a funky waterfront restaurant at the north end of town . Guiltily she remembered that she had told the boy she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date she must have known she had n't the slightest intention of keeping . She was behaving badly , no doubt about that , hurting someone young and poverty-stricken , more vulnerable than she was ; but she had already declared she was leaving tomorrow afternoon , so he could n't expect much . At Sinbad 's some French tourists invited her to a party , where an almond-eyed Swahili musician , with skin the color of smoked glass , played a haunting flute . The older Frenchman , a portly , bearded homosexual , danced a ludicrous jig ; everybody clapped and laughed , including her . After last night , she did n't mind being a superficial tourist . The flute player , Abdulnasser , walked her back to her hotel , gazing intensely into her eyes as he said goodnight . If she was going to welch on redefining romance and succumb to an inappropriate dalliance , she thought , it should have been with him  --  handsome , artistic , a native of " The Isle of Love .

Tomorrow , she promised herself , she would go to The Yoghurt Inn and say goodbye to Nicholas . <p> In the morning , very early , right after the mosques ' orgiastic howl , Dolores is awakened by the sound of her name . She opens the shutter ; the boy is standing on the street outside , staring anxiously up at her window . Half-asleep , she throws on her caftan , and goes downstairs to the narrow stone street . As she approaches what she imagines will be an unpleasant scene , she sees that he is breathing with difficulty , almost panting , his face a rigid mask of distress . Again , he places his hand over his heart , as if to encourage it to keep beating . He stands like this , gasping , looking at her with dry , parted lips . " You did not take your breakfast at The Yoghurt Inn , " he finally says , accusation absent from his flat , toneless voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were n't coming to my room last night .

They say they will tell the police . And the police will beat me . " As the boy speaks , his voice rises , and the anguish that seems to smother his features lifts to reveal harder , angry bones . " I do not have a tape deck , " he says . " I do not have a clock . " He looks pointedly at her watch . " Yesterday , I waited for you all the day . I did not sleep .
