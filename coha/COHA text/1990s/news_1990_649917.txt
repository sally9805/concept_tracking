<p> The deaths of 21 Palestinians from Israeli police gunfire have made it clear that the U.S. could not keep Arab nations in its shaky Middle East military coalition if it launched a military offensive against Iraq and Saddam Hussein . <p> This is so whether you accept Israel 's contention that the 21 deserved what they got , or the more general view that the police barrage was unjustified . Either way , the events on the Temple Mount raised the possibility of renewed Arab unity against Israel and the breakdown of the U.S. coalition against Iraq . <p> So serious was the threat considered by President Bush that his Administration introduced in the Security Council a U.S. resolution condemning Israel , and designed to make it possible for Arab nations like Egypt and Syria to remain in the coalition . That 's as far as any U.S. Government has gone in chastising Israel , and defying its powerful U.S. supporters . <p> Even so , the Palestine Liberation Organization and other Arabs unsuccessfully sought a stronger resolution against Israel , which did not ease the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Israel , as promised , rebuffs a U.N . investigating mission , the crisis could be rekindled . <p> Yet the shooting of Palestinians produced a relatively minor Arab reaction compared with what would follow a U.S. assault on Iraq . Arabs who have joined in a justified international effort to stop Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia will not take part in a military attack on another Arab nation and on a man many Arabs regard as a hero and leader . <p> " Egyptian forces in Saudi Arabia will not participate in any offensive , " their commander , Gen. Mohammed Ali Bilal , has said . Syria 's attitude is not so clear , and Hafez al-Assad no doubt would like to see the end of Mr. Hussein as a rival for Arab leadership ; but he could hardly stand alone with the U.S. in an attack on Iraq when other Arab nations were holding back or aiding Mr. Hussein . <p> It 's not even certain that most non-Arab allies would join the U.S. in a desert offensive against Iraq . Mrs. Thatcher , as if nostalgic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech to the Conservative Party last week . But the U.S. would need more than British backing if it were to make war on Iraq under supposed international auspices . Is the Soviet Union likely to join the U.S. and Britain in an anti-Arab war ? <p> Up to now , Mr. Bush has admirably succeeded in putting together , leading and maintaining a collective-security effort in the Mideast that has restored credibility to the concept . It would vitiate that success and dash the concept if , in the end , the U.S. were to act alone , or in concert only with the British , to assert a military settlement of a political crisis . <p> But what about Kuwait and Mr. Hussein 's aggression ? If belligerent talk from Washington and London were muted , a settlement that restored Kuwaiti independence - but not the Emirate - and gave Iraq access to the Persian Gulf might not be impossible . Mr. Bush would have to swallow a few tough words , but that 's what makes a compromise . <p> Even if that could be arranged , hawkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left with his army , his chemical weapons , his nuclear ambitions , his savage dictatorship and his aggressive intentions . How , they ask , can the U.S. , paragon of peace and democracy , permit any such thing ? <p> Two responses are in order . The first is that if Saddam Hussein remains in power after a Kuwaiti compromise , he might cause trouble in the future , even after the massive international rebuke to his first aggression . But then again , he might not ; predicting what may happen in five years , or ten , is an uncertain art , not necessarily improved by experience . And preventive war is only aggression with good intentions . <p> Second , if collective security could shut off the possibility of an invasion of Saudi Arabia , and impose a punishing blockade and embargo on an offender nation , it 's possible collective security could provide the Mideast and the world with needed future protection against Iraq . Peace-loving nations , of which the anti-Iraq coalition supposedly is composed , owe it to the world to take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without explicitly stating the idea that war is the only alternative if economic sanctions do n't cause Mr. Hussein to surrender . The President has suggested , for example , that " Nuremberg trials " await Iraqi leaders . But tough talk is cheap ; war costs real lives .
