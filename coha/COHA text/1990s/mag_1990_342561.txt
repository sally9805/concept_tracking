There was a stroke ! Or two , to be precise . With a war resolution in hand , George Bush last week took steps to begin a high-level dialogue with Saddam Hussein . Less than 18 hours after the Security Council authorized the use of force against Iraq if Saddam fails to comply with the U.N . ' s call for an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait by Jan. 15  --  a triumph for U.S. diplomacy  --  Bush made a surprise announcement . Iraq 's Foreign Minister would be welcome at the White House during the week of Dec. 10 , and Secretary of State James Baker could meet with Saddam in Baghdad thereafter . <P> By giving content to the " one last chance " aspect of the latest U.N . resolution , Bush had , for the time being at least , confounded his domestic opponents  --  especially those on Capitol Hill . Few will dispute the President 's assertion that he is attempting to " go the extra mile for peace . " Few will seek to constrain his handling of the crisis , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by then it may be too late to again cry " Wait ! " <P> But what exactly will the U.S. and Iraq talk about ? Everything and nothing , it seems . During his midday press conference last Friday , Bush said Baker would be prepared " to discuss all aspects of the gulf crisis , " words that appeared to telegraph the possibility of a face-saving compromise . But there " can be no face-saving , " Bush added only minutes later . Baker 's will not be a " trip of concession , " the President insisted . His sole purpose will be to make sure Saddam " understands the commitment of the U.S. " to " implementing to a T . . . the United Nations position . " That would mean Bush and Baker are ready only to discuss the manner and timing of Iraq 's capitulation . <P> Whether Saddam would be receptive to that message remained highly doubtful . In a tough statement at week 's end , the Iraqi government agreed to the proposed meetings but referred to Bush as " arrogant " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vowed to bring up the Palestinian question and other Arab grievances at the talks . <P> If Bush 's elaboration accurately reflects his real intentions , then the diplomatic shuttling to come is probably best viewed as a clever public- relations exercise , a dance designed to convince audiences at home and abroad that the anti-Saddam coalition has exhausted every possibility for a peaceful resolution to the crisis before going to war . " When ( ( Bush ) ) saw us last month , " says a senior Kuwaiti official , " we were told we would hear and see a lot of things that might be upsetting but that he was not going to give in and that in the end it will be important for the world to believe we have spared no effort to bring Saddam to his senses . " <P> If long-term gulf stability is the Administration 's primary goal , then last week 's highlight was Bush 's assertion that the " status-quo ante will not be enough . " Since Aug. 8 the President 's stated objective has been to get Iraq out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he has told allied leaders privately : he will not allow Iraq 's awesome ability to wage war to remain intact . <P> The anti-Saddam coalition has three options if it wants to neutralize the worst of Saddam 's war-fighting capacity :
