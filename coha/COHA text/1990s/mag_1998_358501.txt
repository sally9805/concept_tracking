The Pietraroia limestone beds near Naples , Italy , are celebrated for the exquisite fossils they 've yielded up since the early 1800s  --  gorgeously preserved specimens of prehistoric fish and a few birds . No dinosaurs , though . While the rocks date back some 110 million years , smack in the middle of the terrible lizards ' reign , not a single dinosaur bone had ever been found there . As far as amateur paleontologist Giovanni Todesco knew , that dismal record was still intact even after he unearthed a 9-in. - long specimen about a decade ago . The nearly complete skeleton , missing only its tail and the lower part of its legs , looked as if it belonged to a bird , and that 's what Todesco assumed it was . <P> But a couple of years later , he went to see Jurassic Park . As he viewed its distinctly birdlike velociraptors , it suddenly dawned on Todesco that he 'd better get a second opinion . Sure enough , when he showed his little critter to experts at a paleontology museum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinosaur ever found in Pietraroia but the first found anywhere in Italy . <P> That fact alone made the discovery important . But on closer examination , scientists found something even more remarkable : not only had the mini-dino 's bones survived ( save those of the lower legs and tail ) , but so , evidently , had some of the tissues inside . As described in the current issue of the journal Nature , the dinosaur , almost certainly a baby , has significant amounts of its intestines and liver still intact , along with muscles and the cartilage that once housed its windpipe  --  " details of soft anatomy never seen previously in any dinosaur , " write Italian paleontologists Cristiano Dal Sasso and Marco Signore . <P> As a result , the newly named Scipionyx samniticus may end up telling paleontologists more about the anatomy of theropods  --  a group of two-legged dinosaurs  --  than they could ever learn from bones alone . The group , which includes Tyrannosaurus rex as well as velociraptors , is considered by many to comprise the direct ancestors of modern birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or torpedo  --  that connection . Already , in fact , some scientists are suggesting that the position of the liver indicates an internal structure more like a lizard 's than a bird 's , undercutting the dinosaur-bird link . Its breastbone , on the other hand , says paleontologist Mark Norell of the American Museum of Natural History , could hardly be more birdlike . <P> No matter Scipionyx 's evolutionary significance , its aesthetic significance is clear . " It really is a beautiful specimen , " says Norell . On that , he gets no disagreement from anybody .
