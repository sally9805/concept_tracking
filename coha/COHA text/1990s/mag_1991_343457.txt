Astronomers and physicists have learned repeatedly that the universe is more creative than they are . Time and again they have peered closely at the cosmos and discovered some object or phenomenon that they had never imagined could exist . The latest surprise came last week , and it forced scientists to drop whatever they were doing and scribble hurried calculations , even on napkins and scraps of envelopes . A report in the Astrophysical Journal claimed that something gigantic is hiding in the core of a distant galaxy called NGC 6240 . Perhaps it is a black hole , a concentration of matter so dense that not even light can escape its powerful gravity . If so , it is more massive by far than any black hole ever detected . Or it may be something so bizarre that it does not fit into existing theories . <P> The history of science is full of similar discoveries , some of which have revolutionized ideas about the universe and many of which turned out to be less than they had seemed . In the former category , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the muon , an elementary particle similar to the electron but more massive . Existing theories had predicted no such thing , and its appearance greatly complicated high-energy physics . " Who ordered that ? " grumbled theorist I.I . Rabi at the time . But the muon and its kin led eventually to a new understanding of the subatomic world . <P> And then there are the breakthroughs that become embarrassments . Cold fusion is probably in this category . So is the discovery , reported two years ago , that under certain conditions a gyroscope weighs less when spun upside down . If that were true , it would force scientists to rewrite the laws of gravity . <P> Now comes the mysterious phenomenon in NGC 6240 . It was first spotted in 1986 by astronomers working with a University of Hawaii telescope , but they checked and rechecked their puzzling findings before finally publishing a report last week . At first blush , it looks temptingly revolutionary . The apparent object is invisible , detectable only by its gravitational pull on surrounding gases . Calculation pegs its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun , or about as much as the entire Milky Way . Yet it is squeezed into a mere 3,000 light-years , only about one-thirtieth the diameter of the Milky Way . The mass could come from tightly packed stars , but then their light should be blazingly bright , contend the report 's authors . The only other choices : a black hole of unprecedented proportions , or some even more peculiar form of matter . <P> NGC 6240 is an abnormal galaxy though . In fact , it is really two galaxies in the process of colliding . The violence of the collision may account for the unexpected forces at work , rather than a black hole or some other strange object . And even if there is a great mass in the galaxy , it could be made of ordinary stars . All it would take to hide these would be a veil of dust . <P> At an informal lunch last week , members of Princeton 's prestigious astrophysics department checked their envelopes and napkins and gave this discovery a preliminary thumbs-down . They think a simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All would admit , however , that they have been surprised before  --  and will be again .
