Tenth in a series <p> Ever since we were young , most of us have pointed to a group of small fish we saw in the water and said , " look at the minnows . " We knew they were minnows because after all they were small and kind of round - right ? Wrong . What most of us did not know is that just because a fish is small , it does not mean it is a minnow . Half the time what we thought were minnows were probably young fish - perhaps some perch or bass or even trout . <p> The actual group of fish known to scientists is " minnows " comes in all shapes and sizes . Some species , like the fathead minnow and the blacknose dace , are small and do look like the classic minnow we usually picture . But other species , like the fallfish and the creek chub , can grow to be 11 plus inches long and are fun to catch . <p> Minnows are interesting creatures to observe . Many minnows reproduce in groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time resulting in hybrid minnows . Certain species build nests while others utilize existing nests of co-existing species . Male minnows develop breeding tubercles ( small , thorn-like structures ) on the head and face during spawning . These tubercles may be numerous and feel like sandpaper or they may be few in number and quite large . They are used in nest construction and in maintaining body contact with spawning females . <p> Minnows are important food items for other fish species in most of the state 's waters . They are essential in maintaining healthy aquatic systems . While several species of minnows are caught by anglers and several more are used as bait fish , the vast majority of minnows never even receive a passing glance from most humans . <p> In New York State , there are 48 known species of minnows . They make up the largest family of fish found in the state . Below we discuss a few of the more common and colorful species of New York 's minnows . Persons interested in finding more detailed descriptions for any member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada by W B. Scott and E. J. Crossman and 7-be Inland Fishes of New York State by C. Lavett Smith . Fallfish <p> The largest of New York 's native minnows , fallfish can grow to be 17 inches in length . They can put up a decent fight when hooked and are frequently caught by trout fishermen when flyfishing . <p> With the exception of Long Island , the Black River Basin and west of the Genesee River , fallfish are found in waters across New York State . They live in clear streams , lakes and ponds and do not tolerate muddy water . Young fallfish prefer riffle ( fast water ) sections of streams while adult fallfish usually remain in deeper pools . <p> Bright silver in color , smaller fallfish ( under eight inches ) are often confused with their relative the common shiner . However , larger adults are rather dull silver in color and the differences between the two fish species is more apparent . Mature male fallfish will develop a pinkish tint to their heads during breeding season . <p> Fallfish are group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones in their mouths . The round nest can be four feet wide and nearly one and one half feet high . <p> Fallfish feed on insects , small fish , crayfish and some plant material . Small fallfish are eaten by other fish and larger fallfish fall prey to fish-eating birds such as ospreys . Although edible when taken from cold water , fallfish are not normally eaten by anglers . However , smaller fish are sometimes used as bait . Creek Chub <p> Large minnows , creek chubs can reach six to 12 inches in length . They live in all but the fastest moving waters of streams and rarely inhabit lakes . With the exception of Long island , they are found in waters across the state . <p> Generally dark in color , creek chubs have a purple sheen on their sides . They can be distinguished from most other minnow species by a dark spot at the base of the dorsal ( back ) fin . Male creek chubs develop a pink coloration during spawning . <p> In some waters , creek chubs look like they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are often heavily covered with the parasite that causes black spot disease . While the parasite may affect the fish 's appearance , it is generally harmless to the fish 's health and is not transmittable to humans . <p> Similar to fallfish , male creek chubs build nests in gravel . Females then deposit eggs and the males cover them . After several females have spawned in succession in one nest , the nests can reach several feet long . Interestingly , female creek chubs will often float belly-up after spawning - as if dead . They quickly recover , however , and swim off to spawn several more times . Creek chubs readily take baited hooks and are often caught by children . While they can be eaten , these fish are generally released . Anglers often use creek chubs for bait . Golden Shiner <p> One of the most widespread fish in New York , golden shiners are found in waters across the state . They are one of the most popular bait fish and have been raised by people for the bait industry for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just about any place the water is quiet , weedy , clean and somewhat shallow . They do not have the " typical " minnow body shape , but are instead deep and compressed . The lateral line that runs along their sides noticeably dips down in the middle of their bodies , distinguishing them from some of their relatives . juvenile golden shiners are silver , but adults are gold or brassy with red fins . Adult golden shiners are generally five to seven inches long , but can grow as long as 10 inches . <p> Golden shiners grow rapidly and reach maturity at age two . They reproduce in late spring/early summer and require algae and other aquatic vegetation to spawn . The adhesive eggs are simply scattered over vegetation . There is no parental care . <p> Aside from their use as bait , golden shiners are occasionally caught and eaten by fishermen . Blacknose Dace <p> A small minnow , blacknose dace rarely grow larger than three inches long . They live in clear streams where current is present , and are often the only fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Blacknose dace can be distinguished from other minnows by the numerous speckles on their dark upper bodies . The lower part of the body is cream-colored with fewer speckles . A dark line runs from the nose to the tail and during breeding , males develop a green tint and red fins . <p> Relatively short-lived , blacknose dace i-nature at age two and rarely live past age four . They are spring spawners , with males establishing territories over gravel in shallow riffles . Males perform a spawning ritual but must then immediately defend the eggs from other dace who attempt to eat them . <p> In addition to falling prey to other fish species and birds , blacknose dace are used as bait by anglers in some areas . They are easily captured in minnow traps or by seines ( where allowed ) . Longnose Dace <p> Unusual in appearance , longnose dace look like miniature sharks . They have a prominent snout with an underslung ( lower jaw shorter than top ) mouth . They range in color from olive to brown on back shading to cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to five inches in length . <p> Longnose dace are found in streams across New York State except for Long island . They have specific habitat requirements , living only in riffle areas where there is fast water current . <p> Spawning takes place in late spring in shallow riffles over gravel bottoms . Male longnose dace guard territories and mate with females as they enter this territory . Following hatching , the young float downstream to live in quiet water areas . After several months , longnose dace change to their adult lifestyle and move to areas of high water velocity . <p> Bottom dwelling fish , longnose dace use their underslung mouths to feed on fish eggs and insects  --  especially black fly larvae . Except for occasional use as bait by anglers , this fish has little interaction with man . Central Stoneroller <p> Central stonerollers are found in riffles and pools of streams scattered across the state . They require clean water with a current . Stonerollers are locally abundant in the Mohawk River drainage west to the Great Lakes and from the western side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Medium-size minnows , stonerollers average four to six inches in length . They have an unusual appearance , with light colored very noticeable lips . The lower lip has a prominent ridge which they use during feeding to scrape algae and other tiny organisms off rocks . They have long intestines which they need for digesting these foods . Adult stonerollers are generally di-ill gray with a brassy tint . Males develop an orange tint during spawning . <p> Stonerollers are spring spawners . Like many minnow species , male stonerollers build nests by using their mouths to carry or push gravel . Nests are communal and usually located at the upstream end of riffles . Stonerollers have little direct interaction with man . However , because of their need for clean water , these fish are occasionally used as an environmental indicator of stream water quality . Cutlips Minnow <p> With the exception of Long Island and west of the Genesee River , cutlips minnows are common across New York State . They are strictly stream dwellers , found in pool areas with clean gravel and cobble . Cutlips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Generally three to five inches long , these drab , slate-colored minnows are rather ordinary in appearance . Their only prominent feature is their lower jaw that is divided into three lobes ( hence the name ) . While cutlips minnows eat mostly aquatic insects and mullusks , they have the unusual habit of feeding on the eyes of other fish . <p> Spawning takes place in late spring . Using pebbles , males construct round nests . If the proper-sized pebbles are in short supply , the males will steal them from other nests . Several females mate with one male who abandons the nest after spawning . Cutlips minnows have little interaction with man . Redside Dace <p> Redside dace are one of the most colorful minnows . Their backs are iridescent dark green or blue with a gold stripe on the side . There is a red band that runs from the gills to mid-body below the gold stripe . Dark scales are scattered across the body . <p> Redside dace live in clean , clear small streams . They are generally found only in pool areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redside dace occur in streams across the southern part of the state to the western Catskills , in the upper Mohawk drainage and in the Tug Hill area . <p> Small in size ( three to four inches long ) , redside dace feed mostly on insects . Their large mouths enable them to capture flying insects while leaping out of the water . Spawning occurs in late spring . Redside dace are group spawners - frequently depositing their eggs in creek chub nests . There is no parental care given either the eggs or young . <p> Similar to stonerollers , redside dace make good environmental indicators of water quality because of their need for clean water . Spottail Shiner <p> Silver colored fish , spottail shiners get their name from the prominent dark spot on their tails . They can live in a variety of habitats , but prefer sandy areas in large lakes and streams . Spottail shiners are found in Lake Erie , Lake Ontario , the St. Lawrence River , the Hudson River Drainage and the Finger Lakes Region east to the Delaware and Mohawk rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four inches in length . They are early summer spawners and spawn in areas with sandy bottoms . Large numbers gather over the spawning sites to deposit eggs . There is no parental care given . <p> Adult spottail shiners feed on algae , insects and fish eggs and larvae ( including their own ) . In areas where they are abundant , they are usually the main forage item for other fish . Spottail shiners are frequently used as baitfish by anglers . Their scales fall off easily when handled . Emerald Shiner <p> Different from many other species of minnows , emerald shiners are open-water ( pelagic ) fish . They are only found in large rivers and lakes such as the Hudson , Niagara and lower Mohawk rivers and in the Great Lakes , Oneida Lake and Lake Champlain . <p> Emerald shiners average three to four inches in length and have very short snouts with large eyes . They are generally silver in color with green iridescence on the top fading to silver/white on the belly . Young emerald shiners are semi-transparent in appearance . <p> Emerald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they do not spawn over gravel or vegetation but release their eggs in mid-water . <p> Plankton feeders , emerald shiners will approach the surface at dark to feed but retreat to deeper water in the day . Their population levels widely fluctuate , with one year their numbers being low and the next year their numbers high . In years when emerald shiners are abundant , they are important forage fish for predators as well as important bait fish for anglers . Many anglers know these fish as " buckeyes . " Northern Redbelly Dace <p> Limited in range in New York State , northern redbelly dace are mostly found in the Adirondacks . They occur in boggy lakes , creeks and ponds where the water is often dark brown . in streams , redbelly dace prefer quiet areas with a bottom of silt or decaying vegetation . <p> Redbelly dace are dark brown or black on the back and yellow to red on the belly . Two dark stripes run the length of the upper body . They have small mouths and large eyes . Redbelly dace are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Redbelly dace spawn in late spring . Eggs are deposited in algae mats and then left unguarded . Adult fish feed on plant materials and some zooplankton and insects . Although they are used as a baitfish in some parts of Canada , redbelly dace are rarely used for bait by people in New York State . Common Shiner <p> As the name implies , common shiners are found in numerous waters across New York State . They are primarily stream fish preferring areas without fast-moving water . They will tolerate some silt , but can not survive in muddy water . <p> Common shiners are generally three to four inches long , but can grow as large as six inches . They have large , diamond-shaped scales covering their mostly silver bodies . During the spawning season , male common shiners develop blue backs and red bellies . <p> Spawning occurs in late spring . Males select nest sites at the upstream end of riffles . Common shiners will spawn in both groups and individual pairs . These fish are known for using other minnow nests to spawn in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Common shiners eat a number of different food items including insects , fish larvae and plant material . In turn , these minnows are eaten by other fish and wildlife species such as kingfishers , mergansers , bass and pike . Northern pike anglers often use common shiners for bait . Fathead Minnow <p> Fathead minnows are small in size , averaging two to three inches in length . They are stubby , heavy-bodied fish with small mouths and a lateral line that stops under the dorsal fin . They are generally dull in color , with dark bodies and a slight brass tint on the sides . <p> With the exception of Long Island , fathead minnows are found in waters across New York State . They prefer ponds and slow-moving water in streams . They can tolerate muddy water and are occasionally found in roadside ditches . In addition , fathead minnows can tolerate water with salt in it . <p> While fathead minnows do use nests during spawning , their nests differ from other minnow species . Fathead minnows deposit their adhesive eggs in sites ( or nests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lily pads and even inside beer cans . Several females deposit eggs in the same nest . After spawning , males chase away the females and then remain with and guard the nest until the eggs hatch . <p> Because of their small size , fathead minnows are an important food item for a number of fish and wildlife species . Fishermen also find fathead minnows important . These fish are raised commercially for bait and for stocking in farm ponds as forage for gamefish . Fathead minnows are also the most commonly used fish in toxicity studies . River Chub <p> River chubs are stubby looking minnows with small eyes . They have large scales , edged in black , covering their generally silvery bodies . While they normally average four to six inches in length , they can grow as long as eight inches . <p> River chubs live in large gravel or rocky bottomed creeks with clear water . They are found in the Susquehanna drainage basin and parts of western New York . They are only occasionally used as bait by fishermen . <p> Male river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for spawning . Nests are built in stream bottoms that contain large gravel and rocks . The males dig shallow pits and backfill them with selected stones until a small mound is formed . During this process , male river chubs will move nearly 200 pounds of pebbles . Actual spawning takes place in a trough built on top of the nest which is then refilled with pebbles after the eggs are deposited . <p> Similarities and Differences Between New York 's Fish <p> FALLFISH Description : <p> 12-17 " long <p> Smaller fish are bright silver ; larger fish are dull silver <p> Habitat : <p> Clear streams and lakes and ponds <p> Young prefer riffles , adults pools <p> Does not tolerate muddy water <p> Reproduction : <p> Spawns in groups in late spring ( April-June ) <p> Males build nests in stream gravel .

In addition , many types of fish have different common names in different parts of the country . To distinguish one organism from another , biologists give each a scientific name that is unique to that organism . The names are derived from the Latin language and consist of a genus and a species . The genus name is first and is capitalized . The species name is second and is in lower case . Both the genus and species are either underlined or italicized when written . While several organisms in the same " family " share a common genus name ( like family members sharing a last name ) they have different species names .
