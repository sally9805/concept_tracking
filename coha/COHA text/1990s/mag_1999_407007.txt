Before you tie on that clicking , tickihg , buzzing , whirring , rattling marching-band of a bass lure , consider a few surprising facts about what largemouths actually hear under water // A bass boat settles down to a quiet drift over a shallow point extending into a vast basin of open water . The angler picks up a rod , unhooks a BB-filled minnow plug from the rod 's first guide and launches a long , downwind cast . Then he begins his familiar , steady retrieve , without a clue that-for better or worse-his rattling lure is broadcasting a din to every bass within a quarter-mile of the boat . The characteristics of underwater sound are truly a believe-it-or-not story . Before man was a technological presence in the oceans of the world , it 's believed that pods of gray whales , using their highly developed language of " songs , " could audibly communicate with other schools at distances of up to 6,000 miles . What 's more , these songs are not highly specialized sonar signals , but sound signals that fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , however , due to the racket of large-scale shipping and other sources of submarine noise pollution , that hearing range has been cut to a couple hundred miles at best . It 's no wonder that these communicationdependent mammals frequently lose their bearings and become beached . Photograph Photograph Photograph A noisy lure may prompt a bass to invest gale , but the fish may not connect the sound the the lure // Extreme examples of animals using sound in an air environment-such as owls acoustically locating prey in darkness and bats using sonar to catch insects in flight-pale in comparison to what fish and aquatic mammals can hear . In studies , blindfolded porpoises have distinguished between two cylindrical rods that differ in size by only a hundredth of an inch by emitting clicking sounds and analyzing their echo . So , how do whales , porpoises ... and bass achieve such feats of aural excellence ? Count out advanced ear development . In bass , that organ is simplicity defined . The fact is , the dynamics of underwater sound transmission are so impressive that most fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have evolved to capture airborne noises . THE WATER MEDIUM For humans to hear it , sound must be collected with the outer ear and funneled through a small hole to resonate the eardrum , which then conveys the sound through a series of tiny bones to the inner ear . Animals that possess large external ears and ear openings , like foxes and deer , can hear much better than animals with relatively small ears , like people . But that 's in the terrestrial world . The body of a bass is about the same density as water . Sounds from every direction pass right through the fish , virtually unhindered , to its inner ear . Therefore , there 's no need to collect sound with elaborate external appendages . Furthermore , sound travels at 1,087 feet per second through air ; it travels at 4,818 feet per second through water . So efficient is the transmission of sound under water that the energy of an exploding firecracker can seriously injure or even kill a submerged man . ( On an interesting side note , the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictated by the difference in density between the two media . Water is 800 times denser than air , and allows only one ten-thousandth of the sound energy from above water to penetrate the surface . Which is why your partner 's barking at you to " shut up , you 're spooking the fish " is probably misplaced criticism . ) DINNER BELL OR DEATH KNELL ? So what do bass hear when a fisherman retrieves a noisemaking lure like a RatL-Trap through the water ? It is certainly not a natural sound . If minnows made that kind of a ruckus there would be so much background noise under water no fish could make sense of the acoustic riot . Still , I believe there are times when such sound chambers in a lure are helpful , just as there are times when they are not . My belief that even unnatural sounds can sometimes be helpful is based on several factors . Chief among them is the fact that a bass is a predator , and one of the fundamental predatory principles is optimism . Anything a predator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " hope " that it represents a feeding opportunity . However natural or unnatural a stimulus may seem , it is a bass 's instinct to investigate and determine whether it amounts to a chance for a meal . Most of the ways humans locate sounds are based on the fact that sound travels so inefficiently in air . Amplitude drops off sharply with distance , so we use clues like loudness and differences in volume between the left and right ear to locate the source of a sound . Conversely , sound travels with such incredible efficiency under water that a rattling lure produces almost the same volume at 200 yards as it does when it 's only a few feet away . So the volume of a noise is of almost no help to a bass in locating its source . And because waterborne sound passes virtually resistance-free through a fish 's body , the noise reaches both of the fish 's ears at the same time without giving any impression of the sound 's direction . Water 's efficiency as a conveyor of sound is a product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be squeezed ; if it could , the weight of the liquid above it would collapse water at the bottom of the ocean into a solid mass ) , which is why sound moves through water much as it would through a solid substance . Imagine workmen servicing a radiator pipe in an old building . Once the hammering starts , you might have to look around to assure yourself the banging is not being done in the room in which you are standing , even though the workers might be several floors and a considerable distance away . But , if that particular pipe is not connected to your radiator and you can even faintly hear the workmen through the walls , you 'll have a fairly good idea of which direction the noise is coming from . Put another way , if you 've ever heard the sound of a boat engine from under water , you know that to place the source of the sound you needed to lift your head above water to hear the sound in air . Now , imagine the quiet underwater world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rattling lure . The fish 's senses are aroused , and curiosity brings it out to look for the source . Unaware that the lure is creating the sound , the bass spots the plug , ignores the buzzing and strikes . In this instance it could be said that an unnatural sound had a positive influence on the catching of the fish . Still , the influence was incidental . SWEET SOUNDS Sound , like any other aspect of a fishing lure , is a tool for anglers to use when the time is right . Neither I , nor anyone else , can tell you all the rules for determining the best time to use sound , but I can tell you that it is certainly not " all of the time , " as purveyors of rattling lures would love to have you believe . It is also important to define the type of noise a lure makes . Subtle , relatively quiet clickers , like those inserted into plastic worms , are less likely to be off-putting to fish than a hollow plastic plug filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the loudest lures for deep water and open spaces , or for situations when the fish are extremely active and responding to things like bright colors and fast retrieves . When I 'm after savvy , more experienced fish , I try to keep my approach as true-to-life as possible , even though I 'm aware that there are plenty of big fish caught on noisemaking plugs . Some of the most natural , albeit quiet , noises emitted by lures are those made when they bump rocks , trees and other underwater structure . Perhaps this is one reason for the long-standing success of lures that have always been categorized as " quiet , " like soft plastics . Their action comes from erratic retrieves and from contact with underwater objects-contact that creates subtle sounds bass are accustomed to hearing from their natural prey . Other natural sounds you can use are the surface disturbances made by poppers , prop baits , chuggers and even buzzbaits . And if you 're wondering where spinnerbaits-one of the oldest and most consistent producers of bass-fit into all of this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are virtually soundless in the water , their blades turning in one direction in harmony with the flow of the water . The throb we feel during the retrieve , the one most of us think is caused by a violent underwater vibration , is simply the weight of the blade tugging on the line , like an out-of-balance tire shaking the steering wheel of a car . Spinnerbaits are consistent with the rules of " quiet baits , " in that they are much more effective when they 're fished through , or bounced off of , underwater structure , creating their version of a natural sound . In that sense , bass fishing is a lot like deer hunting : The soft sound of a twig breaking behind you in the woods can be much more important than the loud roar of a jetliner overhead . lt Photograph Sound moves so efficiently under water that bass can hear a noisemaking lure a quarter-mile away . // <p>
