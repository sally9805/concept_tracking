Imagine going to an abortion clinic and waking up days later handcuffed to a bed in a basement where you will be held prisoner until it is too late to get an abortion . You are the captive of a Christian underground prepared to do anything to protect a fetus ' rights , even kidnap you , take you hundreds of miles from home and " document " your experience as an unwilling mother . Your captors mean to use you as a public test case proving they know what is best . Indeed , you were chosen specifically because you were raped  --  the rape victim has always been the most nettlesome case for right-to-lifers , they explain , and they want to demonstrate that their remedy is redemptive even in extremis . There is no point in screaming , because you can not be heard . There is no point in fighting , because your captors may flinch but will meticulously turn the other cheek , trying to shame you with sanctimony . And there is no point in reasoning , because their minds are made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his will . <P> This nightmare situation , not exactly ripped from the headlines but a plausible extension of them , befalls a young woman at the outset of Keely and Du , perhaps the most important and surely the most harrowing American play produced outside New York City this year . It debuted briefly at Actors Theatre of Louisville 's annual new play festival in March , and the same production opened a five-week run last week at Connecticut 's Hartford Stage Company . Other stagings have been seen at the Dublin Festival and , currently , in Washington , and one is planned at Houston 's Alley Theatre . <P> Such a play could easily degenerate into an endless debate , going over all too familiar terrain , about the nation 's thorniest ethical issue . But just when it seems that is about to happen , playwright Jane Martin turns out to have plenty to say about the antifeminist anger that may underlie much activism . The lead captor , a windy minister , appears to have trouble separating his concern for unborn children from his devotion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of the family . " He condescends unashamedly to the day-to-day keeper , a grandmotherly woman who is trained as a registered nurse and who is old enough to be his mother . In the most unnerving scene , he brings in the kidnap victim 's estranged husband , an alcoholic abuser who considers himself saved by born-again Christianity . It was he who , in the aftermath of their breakup , raped his wife as a way of reasserting his claim . Speaking in an affectless , almost lobotomized-sounding whisper , the husband alternately pledges to put his ex-wife on a pedestal and take possession of her and the child as rightfully his . The minister looks on approvingly throughout . <P> The play 's inner life is the growing bond between the captive , Keely , and her grandmotherly keeper , Du . Part of the closeness is their natural sympathy as women beleaguered by men . Part is a shared , stereotypically feminine impulse to focus on an individual situation more than an abstract principle . Part , too , is the " Stockholm syndrome " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enduring forced togetherness . The effect is especially strong in this situation because , unlike most hostages , the young woman has no fear of being murdered  --  her captors are desperate to keep her alive , if only as an incubator.
