COLD AS IT WAS , the girl would come down to George 's wearing one of those summer dresses , little nothing , and as soon as she 'd settled on her stool at the bar one of the men would say , " Poor girlie . " <p> " Ay , " another would say , " got no clothes . " And the rest would look sober , frown down for a second or two at their beers or their game , while Jack , wherever he looked , could see only the image invoked by those words . When at the end of the night he went home and fell into bed next to Lee , he would conjure the girl again , clothed , and then slowly take off that dress . Sometimes he did her a good turn , fended off one of his drunker companions or started her car when it stalled on the hill or carried her well water , and she took the dress off herself . The sight always shook him . He never got too far , barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before he woke up with his hands caught in Lee 's nightgown . The one time he 'd tried to kiss the girl good-night , she 'd rebuffed him , but that might have been a dream , too . It would be hard to say . Sometimes , in fact , he woke up in the yard with no idea how he 'd got there , curled up like a baby except for his work arm , which was thrown open behind him , dew on his hand . <p> The girl had been living in the woods above town for maybe five months when people began to notice her condition . As she walked down the street the women would nod after her and say , " That 's three months . Four at most . " And the men , overhearing or told this directly , would dismiss the pronouncement with a soft " Nah , " since the girl had turned back the advances of most of them and that was as many as had made advances , and there was no one else around or they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really tried that hard anyway  --  an offer to buy her a drink , drive her home , even walk her way up there , but that was all  --  because there was something fine about her that would have shamed them if they 'd been any pushier . Whatever that something was , they 'd sensed it even before she 'd turned down the first of them , which accounted for the long time it had taken the first of them even to try . And then it became clear that she did n't need company the way they did , and this was assuredly a sign of something as well , which , since they did n't know what it could be , they figured must be above them , too . <p> So her pregnancy was perplexing , and sometimes when she sat on her stool now , with her back to the pool table , the men would consider each other at length , and as soon as someone looked away , eyebrows would rise all around . Since the girl had out-and-out rejected them all and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tacit conclusion that she 'd been coerced , and if not coerced outright , then tricked . They 'd all done their share of tricking and fooling around and going too far , most often only in mind , and if not then they owned up or else , which was why it seemed that the culprit in this case must have been a stranger  --  to them if not to her . <p> Now a stranger in town was a memorable event , so once they gave it some thought , a few of them did seem to recall someone around about three months before , a man nobody claimed as a relative . He was tall , if they remembered right , with black hair and a hat , a fedora , and a beak nose . There the picture began to blur as they thought about it , one of them scratching his bald spot and one tucking in his shirttail and another tapping his flat teeth , and then they were all looking at Jack . He was tall enough and had black hair and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life had he worn a fedora , let alone owned one . " What ? " he said . <p> Roger said , " You were going to say something . " <p> Jack said , " No I was n't . " <p> " Then why 'd you clear your throat ? " <p> " Ca n't a man clear his throat ? " <p> " It was the way you did it , " Roger said . " Town meeting fashion . " The others nodded . <p> From behind the bar came George 's dry voice , " That gal should go back where she came from . " Everyone turned to stare as if he 'd said , " She should be lynched . " Then they were all looking at Jack again . <p> The next time the girl came to the bar , he sat at the far end of the counter , slouched to think , and holding his head with his hand like a shade until he was almost cross-eyed . When George stooped to glance up under his hand , Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he uncupped his nose and slid down off his stool and made his way along the bar toward the girl . Close enough not to be overheard , still he waited for the crack of the pool balls behind him before saying quickly , " Excuse me , Miss . " Then he stuck . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " what 's your name ? " <p> This was n't what he 'd meant to say , but the girl had turned upon him her deep brown eyes . " You know it , " she said . <p> It occurred to him that he must , though he could n't remember at the moment just how he 'd come by it or what it was . " Maybe so , " he said , " but what I wanted to know is , " he nodded , not wanting to point , and lowered his voice , " who 's responsible ? " <p> Her voice dropped , too , to that depth where he felt it before he heard , " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , he had only to raise his eyes . They met hers for a second , reflected , then he scanned the others , confused by her look and low voice until she clapped a five onto the bar and it all became clear . From a long way off , his image looked back at him like the real Jack , the girl walking away , the whole place silent for an instant . <p> There was that kiss . He went over it again , and then the way she 'd pushed him off , and it pained him that he could n't recall any more , though since the girl said so , he must be responsible  --  if not by due process , then by some other process involving his happiness in the grass and his guilt waking up with his wife . Marriage was responsibility ; he 'd always thought so , but never really felt it until the heat went out of his and that other warmth that was supposed to make up the difference failed to appear , and no children either to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now he was going to be visited with a baby after all , one who would grow up regarding him day in and out with strange eyes so that he 'd finally know what responsibility really was . <p> Until three he wandered , sometimes stopping to retch , along the outskirts of town where the last clipped reaches of grassy backyards verged on the weeds of the woods , and when he went home and Lee rolled over in bed to say , " You 'll be in great shape at five , " he was so sorry that he could n't speak . <p> Every time he saw the girl after that , no matter how hard he tried to avoid it , she gave him a slow look so loaded with meaning that after a few times the weight almost hobbled him . Mother Nature put her in a superior position , and there she was , waiting to see who would be the first to say something  --  or would they have to wait till the baby could tell ? This was a possibility Jack could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given him one more look as they passed at the post office , he made up his mind to speak . <p> That night he sat at the kitchen table long after he 'd finished his dinner . When Lee hung up the dish towel and sat down across from him , he told her , " Get ready . " <p> She said , " For what ? " <p> " A baby , " he said . <p> She said , " I 've been ready . " <p> " No , " he told her , " that girl 's . Baby , I mean . " <p> Again she said , " What ? " This time , however , she rounded the word out , making room for suspicion , and then snapped it shut . <p> " I never touched her that I remember , " he told her . " Except to try and . kiss her when I was too drunk to know better , let alone enjoy it , so I 'm not even so sure about that . But she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she aims to give it to me . " <p> Lee only looked at him , silent for so long , such a study , he started to wonder what else there was . Finally all she said , in a hard way she sometimes had , was , " She 's putting you on . <p> " He said , " No . " <p> " And you never touched her . " <p> " Except what I told you . " <p> " So what makes you think ? " She stopped there , but watched him for an answer anyway . After a minute she threw up her hand as if to wake him , then , planting it on the table again , leaned in to say , " She 'll bring that baby here over my dead body . Kisses or no . " <p> At that , he started up from the table , so abruptly that he stumbled , astonished . " Where are you going ? " Lee said , and he looked at her , sitting as fixed in her chair as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after him , " Do n't be a fool . " <p> The girl lived on the point in a ramshackle cabin some said had been built by or belonged to her uncle , though no one knew him or anyone who 'd ever lived there or , in fact , anything except that the cabin had somehow risen in a patch of woods forsaken by everyone but God and that girl . The light was so low by the time Jack reached it that he had to make three slow passes before he found the choked drive with , parked halfway down , her rusted white Honda , no bigger than a freezer box but still blocking the way , so he parked and walked . <p> Through the linty screen he could see a kerosene lamp on a table , where the girl sat , bent to read . As he put his hand on the knob , she said without looking up from her book , " Yes ? " <p> He did n't know exactly what to say , so he waited there , hoping for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just do n't give up , do you ? " <p> " If that 's mine , " he said , again only able to nod , although he was standing in the dark . He was sickened to the point of immobility and had n't even had a drink yet . <p> The girl sat back , crossed her hands on her belly , and turned her head to look at him , with a little glint  --  glasses , which he 'd never seen her wear . Slowly she got up and walked over to where he was . " Christ , " she said , peering at him through the screen , " you do n't remember . " <p> Jack bowed his head . " I do n't remember anything , " he admitted in a voice that almost disappeared . <p> " There 's nothing to remember , " she said . <p> Then he started to shake , and he could n't stop , and he shook as if nothing but the cold were holding him together . <p> " Christ , " the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better come in . " He found it difficult to take a step . " Come on , " she said , tugging , " you 're letting the bugs in , " and he let her lead him to the chair where she 'd been sitting . Under his eyes was the book she 'd been reading , Your Baby and You , which she slid away from him as he sat down . <p> Finally , when he could , he said , " I do n't care . " <p> " Do n't care what ? " <p> " Whose it is . " <p> She was standing above him , studying him in a perplexed and skeptical way that reminded him of his wife , so he told her , " Somebody has to take care of it . " <p> " Take care of it ? " <p> " Sure , " he said , " a baby . " <p> " I thought I would do that , " she said . <p> He said , " You ? " Staring at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of his sense , he said stupidly , <p> " You 're going to keep it ? " <p> " You think I 'd go through all this if I were n't ? " <p> She shamed him into saying , " I guess not , " but that was exactly what he 'd thought  --  or , actually , he had n't thought of the baby in any relation to the girl , except as something she 'd been tricked into bearing until she could drop it on the life that , with its burdens and blind plodding , seemed to deserve it the most , and that seemed to be his , as he tried to explain . He told her he was staying put anyway ; he had responsibilities , but she was free-floating . She came out of nowhere and went where she wanted and did n't need anybody , anybody could see , from the way she turned on his ear any man offering her a hand . <p> " A hand ? " she said . " Do n't need anybody ? You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I 'd go crazy up here alone . " Now he was the skeptical one , thinking she was condescending to soothe him . Then she laid her hand on her belly and said , " But pretty soon I 'll have company . That 's my responsibility . " <p> He felt no lighter for seeing the baby bound to the girl . In fact he felt as if he were weighing right down to the very depths where he could see what a burden it might be to watch someone at the beginning of a hard life like his . He said , " You said it was mine . " <p> " I said look in the mirror . Anyway , you asked for it . You should n't go around thinking just because a woman 's alone she might want you . " <p> " I do n't know why else . " <p> Her smile was a wonder , even if it mocked him a little . " Who knows , " she said . " Maybe there 's something in that . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , " and he turned . " If I do need someone  --  " And she patted her belly as if the baby might answer , although Jack was almost sure that by " someone " she 'd meant him . <p> On his way back he stopped at George 's , where over a beer he told the men that he 'd just called on the girl and asked her point-blank : Who is it ? <p> " Well ? " Roger finally said for the rest . <p> " Nobody , " Jack told them . " Can you beat that ? It came on her like a dream . " <p> Without lifting his head , George raised his eyes from the crossword puzzle he was working . " You see any proof ? " <p> " Hell , " Jack said , " she 's carrying it around right in front of her , Georgie . " <p> Late as it was , Lee was still up , sitting in front of the TV with the sound turned down . " Putting me on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You were right . " <p> As if she were watching the silent show right through him , she stared at his midsection and said , " Let alone enjoy it . " <p> That was her sole comment and , again , all she would say when he tried to get her to come to bed with him and all she would say later , too , when in his dreams he reached for her . <p> The girl had been living in the woods for approximately seven months when George called Jack to the telephone and , extending the receiver , announced for everyone 's benefit , " Rachel . " <p> Jack nodded as if he knew who that was , and then he recognized her voice , strained somewhat , saying , " I need someone now . " <p> She 'd driven as far as the gas station , where she 'd had a pain and become afraid that she might not be safe driving the rest of the way . He took her to Mrs. Holman , the midwife , who turned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Congratulations . " Getting only a blank look in return , she said , " Daddy ? I saw Lee yesterday . " <p> This was news to him . What the midwife had seen of Lee had to be more than he himself had seen of her in the past few months , outside of his dreams . When ? he wanted to ask the woman , how far along ? But she was occupied with the girl , whose sudden shuddering pain unnerved him completely , so he started back to the bar instead , stopping at home on his way to look at Lee and see if he could tell , now that he knew , or maybe she would tell him . When he told her the news about Rachel , she said , " Premature ? " <p> " No , " he said , scrutinizing her , " right on time . " <p> " You never can tell with the little ones , " was all she said . This would be the women 's explanation . <p> It was n't until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the bar . " Girl baby , " he declared . " Seven pounds something . " Jack sat there a while longer . Then , light-headed , he drifted in the direction of the midwife 's , determined to ask about Lee so he would know just what to say to her . <p> He was standing in the walk leading to Holman 's house , wavering , when a Buick drove up and a stranger got out . The man was short and stocky , gray-haired , and wearing a fedora . Taking off his black gloves as he came , he paused before Jack , who was blocking the way , and asked in a soft , bass voice , " Is this the Holman residence ? " <p> Jack stepped aside . When the man paused again and looked back , Jack said to him , " A man should look after his daughter . " <p> " A man should mind his own business , " the man answered , but Jack was already going , stumbling away in a hurry , looking for home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he circled around to the back of the house and lay down in the patchy grass and slept without dreaming until the dew woke him . <p> <p> By ELLEN AKINS <p>
