A checking-him-out checklist to figure out early on whether this is a man you want to spend your quality time with . Photograph " Why go for a man who 's harder to open up than a new jar of peanut butter ? " // Sure , the guy 's a dead ringer for George Clooney , but if you want lasting love , you need more tham gorgeous . To be worthy of your love and devotion , a man should be trushworthy , interesting , and treat you with compassion . . . and it would n't hurt if he keeps you laughing either . " Basically , a quality man is someone for whom you feel the right combination of admiration and passion , " says Beverly Hills , California , psychiatrist Carole Lieberman , coauthor of Bad Boys : Why We Love Them , How to Live With Them , and When to Leave Them ( Dutton , 1997 ) . You do n't have to have known a man since elementary school to clue in to his character : There are subtle signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volumes about a man 's heart and soul . So Cosmo put together a checklist of 10 qualities to check out before making him yours . And while he does n't have to have all of them , the yeas should definitely outnumber the nays . HE HAS A DOG . . . or a godchild or nieces he 's wild about . Even a Chia Pet is a good sign if his eyes go soft when he talks about it . " My boyfriend 's very affectionate with his dog , " says Molly Nover* , a 23-yearold New York City editorial assistant . " Playing with Kodi is a way Ryan shows his sensitive side . A man who does n't take good care of his pet is certainly not going to take care of a girlfriend ! " Provided he 's not spending more time with Fido than with females of his own species , a man who lavishes time and attention on , say , his dog or a garden is one who 's not allergic to commitment . " You want to know that he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , " says New York City marriage counselor Sharyn Wolf ; author of How to Stay Lovers for Life ( Dutton , 1997 ) . " Caring for a pet or a person or a plant shows he has feelings for something besides himself-and that he can attach . " HE 'S NOT FRIEND-OBSESSED " My ex-boyfriend and I were always doing stuff with his friends-we 'd have to go to the movies with other couples , to dinner with 12 people , " says Amelia Sayre , a 27-year-old kennel owner in Litchfield , Connecticut . " He was uncomfortable being alone-or alone with me . Though he was 28 , it became clear to me he had a frat-boy mentality . " Is he continually dragging you out with the gang  --  or worse , leaving you behind while he parties with the boys ? Does he live and die by whether his pals give you the thumbs-up ? If he 's totally dependent on their opinions , he 's probably not ready for a real relationship . The fact that he has good friends says good things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need a man who 's also an independent thinker . HE HAS A SENSE OF HUMOR " It does n't matter if a man 's president of IBM , makes $3 million a year , and has the body of an Olympic athlete , " says Wolf ; " if you ca n't laugh with him , you 're love life 's going to fizzle . " Sandy Leifer , 2,5 , a San Francisco coffee-bar owner , remembers her first date with Allen , a musician she 's been seeing for three months now : " IIe was so funny , he had me rolling on my kitchen linoleum . Humor 's a do-or-die thing for me-I 'm not into comedy-club routines , but when a guy can tell a finny story , that shows me he has a quirky view of the world and we 're going to get along just swell . " Studies show that being able to laugh together helps diffuse tension and keep problems in perspective . " Life is serious enough , " ad ( is Daphne Rose Kingma of Santa Barbara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Tle Four Essential Keys to Discovering the Love of Your Life ( Conari Press , 1996 ) . " When a man can laugh at himself or lovingly tease us when we 're uptight , its very reassuring . Humor is like a message of acceptance . " Of course , if your humor styles do n't mesh-he only laughs at Beavis and Butt-head jokes and old Jerry Lewis movies , while you 've got a subtler sense of the absurd-it can be a total killer . Or worse , " If you 're with a man who makes racist jokes or says things you find reprehensible , he 's letting you see the horrible person he truly is , " says Wolf . HE 'S A GOOD TALKER Why go for a man who 's harder to open up than a new jar of peanut butter ? " My ex-husband and I could n't talk for 10 minutes , " says Margie Wisham , a 33year-old Chicago bank vice president . " He was n't interested in sharing anything . It turned out to be a precise indicator of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type is a man of mystery , who can be seductive at first but often turns out to be someone who either does n't want or fears intimacy , " explains psychiatrist Lieberman . Sharing ideas and thoughts is key to building a strong , interesting life together . Margie , luckily , has since hooked up with a guy who enjoys speaking his mind : " My current boyfriend and I talk about everythingan article we read in the Wall Street Journal , favorite scenes in a movie , general gossip about friends , college football ; we never run out of conversation . " HE 'S GOT A GOOD RELATIONSHIP RESUME A guys commitment history is a huge part of his emotional makeup . A quality man will have had relationships that lasted longer than the World Series . " If he 's demonstrated the ability to be loyal and connect with a woman , been in a relationship long enough to have tried to work through some rough patches , that 's a sign he 's stable , " says Wolf . " On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with longer than three months , he might be a guy who likes the idea of being in a relationship but actually has trouble with the reality of commitment . " If he does n't volunteer his relationship resume , you can tactfully bring up the subject . You do n't need to pry for details , but after a month or so of dating , you can ask him , for instance , " What 's the longest relationship you 've ever had with a woman ? " Listen carefully to how he replies . A quality man is someone who 's gained insight from past experiences , not just a collection of women-are-psycho stories . " After two dinners with this one guy , the subject of past relationships came up , " recalls Tara Daniels , a 24year-old Orlando , Florida , tour guide . " Well , his ex-wife was a witch , and all the women he 'd dated since-each for no longer than three weeks-were either nags or oversensitive or too pushy or too needy . Obviously , this guy had issues . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say about exes-he probably has a problem respecting women . " This is a man who may take out his unresolved resentments on you , " says Dr. Lieberman . " You want a man who takes some responsability for breakaps , because that 's an indicator of how well he 's going to be able to cope when you have fights or disagreements . " HE 'S CURIOUS ABOUT YOU When you talk , he listens , asks questions , and remembers-the names of your friends , the players in your office , even minor points , like that you hate presweetened iced tea . " Bob and I were dating just a few weeks when he left for vacation , " says Joyce Stein , a 26-year-old Birmingham , Alabama , travel agent . " He remembered my telling him some story about how sensitive my skin is and called to ask what fabrics I 'm allergic to because he wanted to buy me a shirt . I thought that was so sweet and thoughtful . " While you do n't want to be quizzed on your background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man ask you to share your thoughts and ideas . " Six months into our relationship-way past the trying-to-impress stage-Scott planned a week of kayaking for us because I 'd mentioned that it was something I 'd really like to try , " says Pat Sturgis , a 32-year-old Boston accountant . " I 'm sure he would rather have gone golfing or windsurfing , but the fact that he wanted to try something we could do together made me feel special . " HE HAS INTEGRITY " I 'd been dating a guy I really liked for a few weeks , " says Yvonne Delrosia , a 25-year-old Miami , Florida , makeup artist . " I told him if he wanted to date other women , that was cool , but then I would n't want to sleep with him . He said lie was happy dating only me , but once in a while , he 'd cancel at the last minute or would n't call for a couple of days . A month and a half later , he said he was n't ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman all along- , mcf probably telling her she was the only one too . " Clearly , if a man ca n't be up front with you from the start , he 's not worth your time . But how can yon tell early on whether or not a man 's honest , responsible , a good guy ? Watch how he treats other people-his mom , friends , even waiters . Tune in to what his coworkers and pals say about him . " It 's not just how a man treats you , " says Diane Bayer , a 27-yearold San Antonio real-estate agent , " but how he goes through the world . I knew Larry had integrity from the way he interacted with his friends and family . I was n't looking for a Mr. Mush , but he has a kind and fair heart , and his word really means something . If you ca n't develop trust and respect for your lover , then all the great sex and great conversation in the world do n't mean a thing . " HE CAN FORGIVEAND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he will argue , it 's how he argues that indicates whether he 's a quality guy . Are you scared by his temper ? Does he storm out without hearing what you have to say or drown you out by turning up the volume on Seinfeld ? If he 's dismissive of your feelings , flies off the handle , or gives you the cold shoulder , you do n't need him . Ideally , a quality man can express what he 's feeling without freaking out . He makes an effort to understand your point of view and admits when he 's wrong-or easily forgives you when you are . " Ben has taught me how to work out problems , " says Mandi Power , a 27-yearold nutritionist from Piermont , New York . " Instead of blaming each other , we take turns explaining what it was that upset us . I 'm pretty stubborn and do n't think it 's easy to say , ' I 'm sorry , ' but it 's easier when you know where the hurt feelings are coming from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of myself as an adventurous type , " says Jamie Simms , a 29yea-old boutique owner in Burlington , Vermont . " But Paul is so enthusiastic about extreme sports , he 's persuaded me to jump out of a plane with him , walk on an Alaskan glacier , try rock climbing . " Whether it 's skydiving , writing , the theater , or his life 's work , a man who exhibits a zest for life is irresistible . " We 're attracted to intensity , " explains Kingma . " When we 're in the presence of someone who 's impassioned about something , that connects us with our own sense of excitement . It 's the power and energy and the thrill that makes ns feel life is worth living . " " I dated a fashion photographer who paid the bills with magazine and advertising shoots , but his real passion was photographing people 's faces and exotic places , " says Annie Dunn , a 30-year-old Denver river-rafting guide . " We traveled together and spent hours at outdoor markets , walking city streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He talked about the earth 's vanishing cultures and the environment and was intent on capturing these lost worlds on film . He really loved his work and finally managed to switch to travel photography . He inspired me . " HE HAS THE HOTS FOR YOU . . . AND VICE VERSA The way he looks and smells , the way his eyes crinkle when he smiles ... something ( or everything ) about him should make you fantasize about getting naked together . If the chemistry 's not there , all the other nine attributes together ca n't make up for it . A sexual connection is essential for a solid union , according to many studies-it 's a physical affirmation of your love . In other words , if that sexual spark is missing , you 're never going to make the full love connection . " I consider my husband , Andrew , my best friend , but after two years , we also ca n't get enough of each other-we 're always holding hands or whooping it up in bed , " says Mary Ralston , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And you should drive him wild with desire too . " Maybe this sounds very throwback-y , but I 'm all for the traditional pursuing of a woman by a man , " says Sarah Bellows , a 30-year-old Chicago portfolio manager . " When a man is ravenous for me , I feel greatmore beautiful , sexier , smarter , more confident . And the sex is incredible . You may not want to be put on a pedestal in other ways , but when it comes to sex , you want to feel your man 's hunger .
