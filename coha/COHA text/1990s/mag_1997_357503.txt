Some National Security Council aides are grumbling that they 'd like to pull the plug on the twice-a-year meetings AL GORE has with Russian Premier VIKTOR CHERNOMYRDIN . The sessions , they say , have lately produced few results . Chernomyrdin has dropped in the Kremlin pecking order and can no longer deliver much . But the Veep , who 's in Russia this week for his ninth Gore-Chernomyrdin commission meeting , is still high on the confabs . In past get-togethers Gore has hammered out agreements on unglamorous issues other politicians avoid , like environmental cleanup and health-care exchanges . This week 's meeting will have " no single newsworthy event " to dazzle reporters , he admits . But the two men were to tackle such thorny subjects as Russian arms sales to Iran , the Mir space station and allegations that Moscow continues to test nuclear weapons . More important , the commission gives Gore a chance to huddle with a foreign leader and , even better , escape the campaign-finance scandal in Washington . <P>  --  By Douglas Waller/Washington      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
