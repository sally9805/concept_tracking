Abstract <p> Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo ( BPPV ) is a common cause of vertigo , and has a typical constellation of physical findings . Atypical forms of paroxysmal positional nystagmus ( APPN ) also exist , and are thought to represent conditions which are in fact not " benign " . We studied 100 consecutive patients with positional vertigo in order to learn whether APPN differed from classic BPPV in etiology or clinical fate , and to learn the incidence of central nervous system ( CNS ) disorders in these patients . <p> APPN was present in 38% of these patients with diverse causes . One-fourth had CNS disorders or vascular insufficiency , the remainder , otogenic or idiopathic . APPN was more likely than BPPV to have a prolonged ( persistent or recurring ) clinical course . Although most cases eventually resolved , duration of symptoms tended to be longer , regardless of etiology . We conclude that APPN has a less favorable prognosis than typical BPPV , and that a CNS etiology should be suspected in prolonged cases . <p> Introduction Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertigo . BPPV is believed to be a peripheral vestibular disorder that is self-limited , hence the designation " benign " . Occasionally patients with positional nystagmus demonstrate atypical findings . Atypical paroxysmal positional nystagmus ( APPN ) may be caused by conditions which are not " benign " , therefore a search for a central nervous system ( CNS ) disorder is frequently conducted in these cases . Our impression has been that APPN is not uncommon in patients with positional nystagmus , whereas the incidence of CNS disease in these patients is low . The aim of this study was to learn the incidence of APPN in patients with positional vertigo , and to learn whether APPN differs from BPPV in etiology , clinical course , radiologic or electronystagmographic findings , and response to therapy . <p> BPPV , first described by Barany , 1 is diagnosed when vertigo and typical nystagmus are elicited by the Dix-Hallpike maneuver. 2 In BPPV , the nystagmus is rotary , directed toward the undermost ear ; has a latency of onset of a few seconds ; is transient , usually lasting less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright ; and shows response decline ( fatigability ) on repeat positioning . In APPN , the nystagmus may be atypical in direction ( e.g. , upbeating , horizontal or ageotropic ) , may be bilateral , may not demonstrate latency or fatigability , or may persist beyond the usual length of time . <p> Nylen was first to recognize that some forms of positional nystagmus were not " benign " , but caused by CNS disease. 3 He postulated that direction-changing nystagmus signified CNS disease , and direction-fixed nystagmus signified benign inner-ear disease . In clinical practice , other forms of positional nystagmus are encountered . Barber and Leigh 4 proposed a system which differentiates static-persistent nystagmus ( i.e. , occurring with passive head maneuvering ) from dynamic-paroxysmal positional nystagmus . The latter can be either typical ( if it displays the usual pattern of BPPV ) or atypical ( if it does not have the usual features ) . The cases classified as APPN in this manuscript correspond to atypical , dynamic-paroxysmal positional nystagmus in this classification . Methods <p> This study involved 100 consecutive patients who had paroxysmal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our clinic at SUNY-Stony Brook between April 1990 and March 1994 . A computerized database was used to compile the data . For each patient , age , gender , date of examination , and duration of symptoms were recorded . An etiology was identified whenever possible : trauma , if vertigo began within two weeks of a head or ear injury ; an otogenic lesion ( such as chronic suppurative otitis media ) or acoustic neuroma , if it preceded the vertigo and if it occurred in the appropriate ear ; Meniere 's disease , if there was a history of episodic vertigo and unilateral sensorineural hearing loss ; vestibular neuritis , if the initial symptom ( by history ) was sudden , continuous vertigo lasting at least a few days ; or ischemic vestibulopathy , if the patient had a history of cardiovascular disease or radiographic evidence of cerebrovascular disease . The disorder was considered idiopathic when no other cause could be identified . <p> Nystagmus was identified by physical examination . All patients in this study had paroxysmal nystagmus during Dix-Hallpike maneuvers ; patients with nystagmus only on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typical if it was rotary or horizontal-rotary , geotropic , elicited in a single head position , with a latency of onset of a few seconds , and duration of less than 30 seconds . Nystagmus that did not display these characteristics was classified as atypical . These atypical cases included nystagmus that was prolonged ( greater than 30 seconds in duration ) ; ageotropic ; upbeating , downbeating , horizontal or skew ; bilateral ( i.e. , occurring in both the head-right and head-left positions ) ; or evoked only by the head-straight-back position . Fatigability , a feature observed in most cases , was not used as a criterion of typicality since many patients would not submit to repeated testing . <p> The clinical pattern of the disease over time was classified as persistent if the symptoms remained unchanged during the period of follow-up ; recurrent , if the symptoms improved and later returned sporadically ; decrescendo , if the symptoms resolved and did not return ; and unknown , if the patient was lost to follow-up after the first visit . The total duration of symptoms was noted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow-up . <p> Audiometry and impedance testing were obtained on all but three patients . Auditory brainstem responses ( ABR ) , electronystagmography ( ENG ) , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) , and high-resolution computed tomography ( CT ) of the temporal bones were obtained on a select basis . ENG was utilized as a confirmatory test but was not used to make the diagnosis . It has been our experience that ENG is not sensitive enough to detect every case of BPPV or APPN because in purely rotary nystagmus , the horizontal and vertical components may be too small to be recorded . <p> Treatment was individualized . Vestibular suppressants such as meclizine were frequently prescribed for symptomatic treatment . Diuretics were used when endolymphatic hydrops was suspected clinically . Brandt-Daroff exercises were recommended to most patients earlier in the study period , unless there was significant musculoskeletal disease. 5 Later in the study , we performed the " canalith repositioning procedure " described by Epley. 6 Singular neurectomy or posterior semicircular canal occlusion was recommended to patients who had disabling symptoms lasting longer than 12 months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In another patient surgical revascularization was performed for vertebrobasilar insufficiency ( VBI ) with subclavian steal . Some patients opted for no therapy when they were apprised of their diagnosis and treatment alternatives . Results <p> Of 100 consecutive patients with paroxysmal positional nystagmus , 62 had typical BPPV and 38 had APPN . The mean age of APPN patients was 58 years , of BPPV patients , 50 years . There was an equal gender distribution in the two groups : 68% of APPN patients and 65% of BPPV patients were female . The period of follow-up was as long as 36 months , with a mean length of follow-up of 4.4 months . <p> Etiology <p> Of the cases of APPN , 10 ( 26% ) were idiopathic , 6 ( 16% ) were traumatic , 11 ( 29% ) were otogenic , and 11 ( 29% ) were caused by ischemia or CNS disease . In contrast , more than half the cases of typical BPPV were idiopathic , and none had a CNS cause . The results are represented in Figure 1 . <p> Looking at these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or otogenic positional vertigo were more likely to have typical BPPV than APPN , while all of the patients with CNS disorders had APPN . <p> Physical Findings in Atypical Cases <p> Various forms of atypical nystagmus were seen , as summarized in Table 1 . The most common atypical finding was prolonged nystagmus , which occurred in 12 patients . Bilateral paroxysmal positional nystagmus occurred in nine patients . Eight patients had vertical or skew nystagmus ; three had horizontal nystagmus ; two had ageotropic rotary nystagmus . Six patients had nystagmus evoked only with the head straight back or on arising . <p> None of these atypical findings was associated with a single etiology , and none occurred exclusively with CNS disease , except for downbeating nystagmus in one case of ischemia . None of the variants of atypical nystagmus was predictive of clinical pattern or of symptom duration . <p> Duration and Clinical Pattern <p> Patients with typical BPPV were more likely to have a decrescendo course and shorter duration of symptoms than patients with APPN ( Figure 2 ) . Patients with APPN were more likely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of symptoms was related to clinical pattern in most instances , with the decrescendo pattern having the shortest mean duration , and recurrent , the longest . Figure 3 shows that the overall duration of symptoms for patients in both groups had a bimodal distribution . In typical BPPV , 42% of patients had resolution of symptoms within three months , 60% within six months . In contrast , 59% of patients with APPN had symptoms six months or longer . <p> Value of Diagnostic Studies <p> Audiograms were obtained in all but three patients . These had localizing value ( i.e. , showed asymmetric hearing loss ) in otogenic cases and in acoustic neuroma . Two post-traumatic patients had unilateral conductive hearing losses . <p> ABR was obtained on a select basis when a retrocochlear or brainstem disorder was suspected , and was often omitted when MRI or CT were obtained first . Twenty-one ABRs were performed . Positive studies were obtained in six cases : two Meniere 's disease , two post-traumatic sensorineural losses , one acoustic neuroma , and one sudden hearing loss . <p> ENG was used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ENG was performed in 20 APPN patients . Three patients had abnormal smooth pursuit , all of whom had idiopathic vertigo . Static positioning nystagmus in a nonspecific pattern was observed in five patients , and direction-changing positioning nystagmus was seen in two ( one with ischemia and one with vestibular neuritis ) . Unilateral caloric weakness was seen in four patients  --  one ischemic , one Meniere , one vestibular neuritis , and one post-traumatic . Five studies were entirely normal . <p> MRI or CT scan was obtained in 30 of the patients with APPN . Findings of probable significance included temporal bone fractures in three patients , an acoustic neuroma in one patient and ischemic changes or vertebrobasilar artery ectasia in three . Findings of possible significance included a cyst of the cerebellar peduncle in one patient . Findings likely to be coincidental included one frontal meningioma , one arachnoid cyst , one pineal cyst , one sphenoid sinusitis , and several occurrences of subcortical bright signals of uncertain significance . The majority of the studies were negative . Eight of the APPN patients did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two had a clinical diagnosis of ischemic vestibulopathy , and one refused the study . <p> Effect of Therapy <p> Symptomatic treatment with meclizine or promethazine was given to 40 patients ( 13 APPN , 27 BPPV ) ; this is not believed to influence outcome . Surgery was performed in five patients  --  two patients with singular neurectomy , one with posterior canal occlusion , and one with acoustic neuroma resection resolved completely after surgery ; one patient with subclavian revascularization continued to have vertigo . Several patients were treated with physical measures , namely Brandt-Daroff maneuvers at home or canal repositioning procedures in the office , and their results are recorded in Table 2 . In most patients , the clinical pattern was established by history before treatment was instituted , and therefore , therapy probably did not influence this tabulation . Discussion <p> Paroxysmal positional nystagmus is a common finding in patients with vertigo and can occur in typical and atypical forms . In this study , typical BPPV resolved in most cases , as expected . Most patients had a decrescendo course , and most resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sizable minority of our patients with typical BPPV ( 40% ) reported symptoms for greater than six months , implying that the prognosis for this condition is not uniformly good . We note that nearly all of these prolonged cases had a clinical pattern of recurrence , and the data may have been influenced by the patients ' recall . <p> In our study , APPN had a longer median duration of symptoms than BPPV . The majority of the patients reported vertigo for longer than six months , and a greater proportion had a clinical pattern of persistent or recurrent symptoms . The clinical pattern could not be predicted from etiology or duration . Nonetheless , many patients with APPN did improve with time , and their overall prognosis was fair , with 40% of patients experiencing resolution of symptoms within six months . <p> The variety of atypical findings observed with Dix-Hallpike testing ( summarized in Table 1 ) implies that APPN is a group of heterogeneous disorders . The most common atypical finding was prolonged nystagmus , lasting longer than 30 seconds . A prolonged paroxysm of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nystagmus ( the finding that Nylen associated with CNS disease 3 ) . The former probably represents typical BPPV that is unusually intense . For example , one of our patients with prolonged ( dynamic ) positional nystagmus was cured by singular neurectomy , implying a peripheral vestibular disorder . <p> Bilateral positional nystagmus may represent either CNS disease or a bilateral inner ear disorder . Longridge and Barber previously found that 35 % of patients with bilateral positional nystagmus had CNS disease. 7 In our series , two of eight patients with bilateral positional nystagmus had ischemia as their diagnosis ; the remainder were post-traumatic , cervicogenic , or idiopathic . <p> Upbeating nystagmus , observed in five of our patients with non-CNS etiologies , may be a usual , gaze-dependent component of typical BPPV ( Katsarkas and Kirkham observed that the eye movements of BPPV , which are typically rotary or horizontal-rotary , depend on the direction of gaze 8 ) . Purely horizontal nystagmus , observed in three patients , represents the **26;157;TOOLONG variant of BPPV. 9 Other forms of atypical nystagmus  --  downbeating , skew , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes  --  ischemia , trauma , and Meniere 's disease . CNS disease should be suspected in these cases , since these eye movements are not generated by independent semicircular canals. 10 <p> While APPN should raise the suspicion of a CNS disorder , three-fourths of the atypical cases in our study had benign causes or were idiopathic . Atypicality in itself does not imply CNS disease . Moreover , ancillary studies  --  ABR , ENG and MRI  --  proved to have low diagnostic yield in this series . ABR was not obtained routinely since MRI was frequently performed first ( often by the referring doctor ) . In only one case did ABR have diagnostic value , showing bilateral wave V prolongation in a patient with VBI . ENG turned up a variety of abnormalities ( other than paroxysmal positional nystagmus ) in the APPN group , but these findings were not often diagnostic . <p> The diagnostic yield of imaging studies was lower than we had expected . MRI or CT were obtained frequently  --  in 30 of the 38 APPN cases  --  and were omitted only if symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other means . Seven of these studies ( 23% ) showed findings of probable diagnostic significance . Three post-traumatic cases revealed fractures on CT , an important finding . Unsuspected tumors were not found . An acoustic neuroma occurred in a patient who had progressive unilateral hearing loss and ataxia ; although he did have positional vertigo , this was not the symptom that suggested the diagnosis . Ischemic vestibulopathy was usually diagnosed on clinical grounds rather than by MRI . There were various instances of findings which suggested , but were not diagnostic of , ischemia , such as subcortical bright signals or vascular ectasia . Indeed , one patient with known VBI had a negative MRI but demonstrated subclavian steal on angiography . We conclude that MRI should generally be obtained in all patients with APPN . <p> In cases of trauma or ischemia , differentiating central from peripheral lesion site may not be straightforward . For example , in cases of closed head injury , positional nystagmus may result from brainstem concussion , labyrinthine concussion , or both . Ischemia too may affect the labyrinth or the brainstem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and experimental evidence that BPPV could arise from anterior vestibular artery occlusion . Barber and Dionne observed typical paroxysmal positional nystagmus in 30% of patients with VBI. 13 Baloh et al observed that VBI is often associated with unilateral caloric weakness , and they regarded this as evidence of labyrinthine ischemia. 14 , 15 In this study we chose to classify ischemic vestibulopathy as a CNS disorder because of the potential seriousness of cerebrovascular disease . <p> We can only make general comments about the effectiveness of therapy since appropriate controls were not used . Medications were usually prescribed with symptomatic rather than curative intent . Physical measures appeared to be beneficial when they were performed . Home head exercises usually resulted in a decrescendo or recurrent course . Canal repositioning maneuvers yielded good initial results , with most BPPV patients improving by the second session of therapy . Three of seven patients with APPN had persistence of symptoms however ; while this number is too small to draw a conclusion , we will continue to monitor our results to learn whether this therapy is as effective in atypical cases . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common . In this study , 38 of 100 patients with positional vertigo had atypical findings . <p> APPN represents a heterogeneous group of disorders . Although most cases of APPN are self-limited , prolonged or recurrent symptoms are more common than in typical BPPV . <p> The incidence of CNS disease was low in this study . MRI has relatively low yield , but should be obtained when symptoms are prolonged and when nystagmus is continuous , bilateral , or bizarre , or when the patient is elderly or has vascular disease . <p> Presented at the Fourth International Symposium on Inner Ear Medicine and Surgery , July 17 , 1994 , Snowmass-Aspen , Colorado . <p> Reprint requests to : Eric E.
