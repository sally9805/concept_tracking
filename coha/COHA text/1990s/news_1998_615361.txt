<p> Tom Wolfe is baffled that some critics are portraying him as a modern-day Sherman who has burned Atlanta in his sizzling new novel , " A Man in Full . " <p> " I was n't there to praise Atlanta nor to bury it , " Wolfe says in an interview in his suite at the Carlyle Hotel . " To me , it 's an exciting backdrop for a story . " <p> Perhaps . But Washington Post critic Jonathan Yardley calls " A Man in Full " ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux , $ 28.95 ) " a thermonuclear explosion " and writes that Sherman , unlike Wolfe , at least allowed the residents to evacuate the city before destroying it . <p> And weeks before the book was published Friday , the Buckhead Coalition withdrew a luncheon invitation because members were upset about the way Wolfe portrayed Buckhead . <p> " All I can say is that I am completely buffaloed , " Wolfe says softly in a voice still tinged with a Virginia accent . " I ca n't imagine what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I never got the invitation in the first place . " After hundreds of inches of pre-publication stories and interviews about the book , Wolfe begins his publicity tour in earnest this week . With 1.2 million copies of the novel in print , the publisher has booked Wolfe with dozens of interviews ; a public reading tonight at New York 's Town Hall theater ; appearances on David Letterman , " Good Morning America , " and " Today " ; a party at the Pierre Hotel ; and an interview Thursday with PBS ' Charlie Rose . <p> And next week , Wolfe heads to Atlanta for a book-signing gala at Borders Books and Music in Buckhead , a speech at the Atlanta History Center , a $ 600-a-plate dinner to benefit the Margaret Mitchell House , lunch at the Piedmont Driving Club and other activities . <p> As he prepares to come to the city he is accused of torching , Wolfe talked about what he learned about Atlanta during his months of research with the help of his friends , developer Mack Taylor and his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . was the skyscrapers . When I started the book back in 1989 , they were still building skyscrapers . It was like a duel or a tournament of great developers . . . . <p> The big difference from the beginning was filling in the whole map of Atlanta and discovering that there are about two-thirds of Atlanta you do n't see . The whole area south of Ponce de Leon is not even mentioned in the guidebooks . . . . Q : How did you get beneath the surface of the city and find what you were looking for ? A : Mostly through talking to people . You can only see so much . Mary and Mack introduced me to a lot of people . I talked to a lot of them and they introduced me to others . It was very eye-opening to see south Atlanta . Q : What was your impression of the politics of race in Atlanta ? A : The details were all new to me and fascinating . I do n't know of a comparable situation . Here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400,000 people , of which probably most are black . Around it , however , you 've got 12 or 14 counties in which people are moving in droves . There are probably 3 million people living around the city . Three million people and they 're making their money in Atlanta . <p> These people in the counties around Atlanta are mostly white . You 've got some Asians moving into Chamblee and Doraville  --  " Chambodia "  --  but mostly those around the city are white and this led to " the Atlanta way , " which is best exemplified by one story I was told that 's in the book . It had to do with a meeting about running a highway through south Atlanta . This very well-spoken lawyer speaking for the business interest was trying to overcome opposition from neighborhoods in south Atlanta , saying , " We 're all in this together ; we have to have a mobile city for traffic and commerce . " And this one minister spoke up and said , " Brother , I do n't mean to interrupt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole lot here . I 'd like to cut straight to the checkered flag . What it gets down to is , you got the money , we got the power . We want the money . " . . . <p> I do n't think of Atlanta as a graft-stricken town as New York in days gone by . What the " Atlanta way " means is , you build us the things we need  --  day care centers , parks , recreation halls  --  and we 'll see what we can do to help you with some of your business . <p> The airport is a prime example . I gather that ( former Mayor ) Maynard Jackson insisted that 30 percent of contracts go to black-owned firms , and he later said with considerable pride that the airport created 25 black millionaires . This relationship between the black power structure and predominantly white business structure is one of the things I found most interesting . Q : Several critics have not been pleased with the novel 's ending , where your character Conrad Hensley introduces Charlie Croker to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it ? A : Speaking only for myself , I was rather pleased with it . I did try to tenderize Charlie Croker for a religious message by bringing him down so low that he was going to hang on to anything . The poor guy was about to lose everything , he 's totally humiliated in front of all the people he cares about in Atlanta , when suddenly this boy materializes who offers him the hope and the way . Now , I thought it was beautiful , but it either works or it does n't . I thought the lovely thing about Stoicism is that it is so totally different from people 's approach to life in this country today . This Stoicism is very stern stuff . Once I put my character Conrad in jail , I suddenly thought of a book that was written , I think , by a pilot named Robinson Reasoner , who had been in jail in Hanoi for seven years . And he wrote in this book that if he had not had a course in philosophy at the Naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 10 minutes from one class on Epictetus , in which the philosopher said they ca n't make you admit to anything that is not true . You 're free as long as you have reason . Q : What most impressed you about the plantation life you describe in the book ? <p> A : It was the most conspicuous form of consumption I had ever seen in my life . I thought the ultimate was in New York . In the plantation belt of South Georgia , you 've got plantations of 15,000 , 25,000 acres or more devoted solely to shooting quail for 13 weeks out of the year . I think at tax time there may be some mention of a farming enterprise . It 's mostly shooting quail at enormous expense . I was at a quail plantation one evening at dinner and the host says exactly what Charlie Croker says in the book . He said , " How 's your quail ? " and I said , " Delicious , " and he said , " They ought to be . Each bird cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birds shot during the year into the cost of the place , and it was exorbitant . . . . <p> I was particularly intrigued by the fact that it was not enough just to have the money , to own the plantation . You also had to be man enough to keep it . You had to be willing to deal with animals and men with your own hands , or with shotguns , if necessary . If you could n't , you did n't deserve a plantation . You could n't be some tenderfoot who comes out with a shotgun at the appointed hour . You had to be a man . <p> It 's very , very Southern . A lot of the book has to do with manhood and what it means to be a man . Q : Obviously this is a testosterone-laden novel . How do women figure into the story ? A : On the quail-shooting plantations , the women are there to approve of this very masculine world , and they should at least support the premise of man 's role as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought of taking hunting lessons just so I could take my son hunting . It 's well worth maintaining the Southern code of manhood . It 's not something ridiculous . Q : Did you shoot while you were there ? A : No I was on the buckboard . . . . I was a tenderfoot . If I had been out there in the field , a lot of people likely would have been in danger . I was offered the opportunity , and I think everyone was relieved when I declined . Q : In The Wall Street Journal , there was a lot of buzzing in town about who is exactly in this book . Obviously you did not pick one developer for your main character , but which people did you meet that left a great impression on you ? A : A lot of the developers did . John Portman is an extraordinary figure , as both a developer and major architect . Tom Cousins , Charlie Ackerman . . . The developers have really been stars in a way that you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mention Donald Trump , but after that , name another name . Q : When the out-of-town media came to town for the Olympics , almost everyone said Atlanta had no soul , no defining identity . Do you agree ? A : I think what the New Yorkers were probably saying was that you could n't duck out of your hotel downtown and find marvelous boutiques and so on . Atlanta is nothing like New York in that respect . All of the boutiques are in malls like Lenox Square and Phipps . It 's not dominated by one area the way Charleston or Savannah is . But Atlanta is in some ways the city of the future . I 'm not the first one to say this . There 's a wonderful book called " Edge City , " in which the author points out how Buckhead became an edge city and how the minions of commerce have relocated to Perimeter Center and beyond . That 's really the future of America 's cities . I think Atlanta manages to maintain a Southern politeness . <p> All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write about in this story . It 's exciting . Q : You were n't too kind to the High Museum crowd in the book with your scene about the homoerotic art exhibit , were you ? A : At first I had this book situated in New York . Charlie Croker was an Atlanta developer who wanted to come to New York and become a national figure . Then I realized that was unlikely , because a developer would be a bigger figure in Atlanta than he would be in New York . Anyway , . . . there was going to be this opening at the Whitney Museum , but I was bored with it . I had done the New York party scene before . <p> But when I finally moved it to Atlanta , with an exhibit of homoerotic art , my belief was that this would be a bit of an issue in Atlanta and among the board members of the High Museum . I also posited the notion that since this had already been pronounced an important discovery , these homoerotic paintings by a dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some museum in New York would show them and they would look like they were in Dogpatch . My assumption was they would have to hold their noses and have the exhibition . Q : No one would criticize it because it would make them appear unsophisticated . A : Right . That 's the great modern sin : to be considered unsophisticated . Q : Time magazine speculated on who might be in the movie . Is there a film deal yet ? A : No . A couple of producers have looked at it and they ca n't figure out a way to make it in the confines of two to three hours . And after what happened to my last book and film , I 'm not exactly biting my fingernails over this . If it happens , I think it would have to be five or six hours long . Maybe HBO would do it . I could n't stand to see it with commercials . Q : More than a decade ago you took American novelists to task for not writing big , sweeping novels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed ? A : No , I see it more profoundly than ever before . A man has just written a novel called " Thumbsucker " about someone who sucks his thumb for the first 21 years of his life . Somehow , " thumbsucking " sums up most of American fiction today . . . . This is an amazing , bizarre , baroque country that nobody is looking into . There should be 20 or 30 novels about a city as rich in material in Atlanta by now . That 's true for Dallas and Chicago and other cities . Q : What 's your next book ? A : I want to do a novel about education . I know that sounds dull , but I think it 's anything but dull . I think it can be fabulous . <p> Atlanta provides such a rich setting , says author Tom Wolfe , that it should have 25 or 30 novels written about it. / JULIE MARKES / Special Photo : Tom Wolfe / JULIE MARKES / Special
