Chapter One SHE WOKE IN THE DARK . THROUGH THE SLATS on the window shades , the first murky hint of dawn slipped , slanting shadowy bars over the bed . It was like waking in a cell . For a moment she simply lay there , shuddering , imprisoned , while the dream faded . After ten years on the force , Eve still had dreams . Six hours before , she 'd killed a man , had watched death creep into his eyes . It was n't the first time she 'd exercised maximum force , or dreamed . She 'd learned to accept the action and the consequences . But it was the child that haunted her . The child she had n't been in time to save . The child whose screams had echoed in the dreams with her own . All the blood , Eve thought , scrubbing sweat from her face with her hands . Such a small little girl to have had so much blood in her . And she knew it was vital that she push it aside . Standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testing . Any officer whose discharge of weapon resulted in termination of life was required to undergo emotional and psychiatric clearance before resuming duty . Eve considered the tests a mild pain in the ass . She would beat them , as she 'd beaten them before . When she rose , the overheads went automatically to low setting , lighting her way into the bath . She winced once at her reflection . Her eyes were swollen from lack of sleep , her skin nearly as pale as the corpses she 'd delegated to the ME . Rather than dwell on it , she stepped into the shower , yawning . " Give me one oh one degrees , full force , " she said and shifted so that the shower spray hit her straight in the face . She let it steam , lathered listlessly while she played through the events of the night before . She was n't due in Testing until nine , and would use the next three hours to settle and let the dream fade away completely . Small doubts and little regrets were often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the machines and the owl-eyed technicians who ran them . Eve did n't intend to be off the streets longer than twenty-four hours . After pulling on a robe , she walked into the kitchen and programmed her AutoChef for coffee , black ; toast , light . Through her window she could hear the heavy hum of air traffic carrying early commuters to offices , late ones home . She 'd chosen the apartment years before because it was in a heavy ground and air pattern , and she liked the noise and crowds . On another yawn , she glanced out the window , followed the rattling journey of an aging airbus hauling laborers not fortunate enough to work in the city or by home ' links . She brought the New York Times up on her monitor and scanned the headlines while the faux caffeine bolstered her system . The AutoChef had burned her toast again , but she ate it anyway , with a vague thought of springing for a replacement unit . She was frowning over an article on a mass recall of droid cocker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and watched her commanding officer flash onto the screen . " Commander . " " Lieutenant . " He gave her a brisk nod , noted the still wet hair and sleepy eyes . " Incident at Twenty-seven West Broadway , eighteenth floor . You 're primary . " Eve lifted a brow . " I 'm on Testing . Subject terminated at twenty-two thirty-five . " " We have override , " he said , without inflection . " Pick up your shield and weapon on the way to the incident . Code Five , Lieutenant . " " Yes , sir . " His face flashed off even as she pushed back from the screen . Code Five meant she would report directly to her commander , and there would be no unsealed interdepartmental reports and no cooperation with the press . In essence , it meant she was on her own . Broadway was noisy and crowded , a party that rowdy guests never left . Street , pedestrian , and sky traffic were miserable , choking the air with bodies and vehicles . In her old days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecks and crushed tourists who were too busy gaping at the show to get out of the way . Even at this hour steam was rising from the stationary and portable food stands that offered everything from rice noodles to soy dogs for the teeming crowds . She had to swerve to avoid an eager merchant on his smoking Glida-Grill , and took his flipped middle finger as a matter of course . Eve double-parked and , skirting a man who smelled worse than his bottle of brew , stepped onto the sidewalk . She scanned the building first , fifty floors of gleaming metal that knifed into the sky from a hilt of concrete . She was propositioned twice before she reached the door . Since this five-block area of West Broadway was affectionately termed Prostitute 's Walk , she was n't surprised . She flashed her badge for the uniform guarding the entrance . " Lieutenant Dallas . " " Yes , sir . " He skimmed his official CompuSeal over the door to keep out the curious , then led the way to the bank of elevators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swished shut behind them . " Fill me in , Officer . " Eve switched on her recorder and waited . " I was n't first on the scene , Lieutenant . Whatever happened upstairs is being kept upstairs . There 's a badge inside waiting for you . We have a homicide , and a Code Five in number eighteen-oh-three . " " Who called it in ? " " I do n't have that information . " He stayed where he was when the elevator opened . Eve stepped out and was alone in a narrow hallway . Security cameras tilted down at her , and her feet were almost soundless on the worn nap of the carpet as she approached 1803 . Ignoring the hand plate , she announced herself , holding her badge up to eye level for the peep cam until the door opened . " Dallas . " " Feeney . " She smiled , pleased to see a familiar face . Ryan Feeney was an old friend and former partner who 'd traded the street for a desk and a top-level position in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computer pluckers these days . " " They wanted brass , and the best . " His lips curved in his wide , rumpled face , but his eyes remained sober . He was a small , stubby man with small , stubby hands and rust-colored hair . " You look beat . " " Rough night . " " So I heard . " He offered her one of the sugared nuts from the bag he habitually carried , studying her , and measuring if she was up to what was waiting in the bedroom beyond . She was young for her rank , barely thirty , with wide brown eyes that had never had a chance to be naive . Her doe-brown hair was cropped short , for convenience rather than style , but suited her triangular face with its razor-edge cheekbones and slight dent in the chin . She was tall , rangy , with a tendency to look thin , but Feeney knew there were solid muscles beneath the leather jacket . But Eve had more-there was also a brain , and a heart . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I picked that up already . Who 's the victim ? " " Sharon DeBlass , granddaughter of Senator DeBlass . " Neither meant anything to her . " Politics is n't my forte , Feeney . " " The gentleman from Virginia , extreme right , old money . The granddaughter took a sharp left a few years back , moved to New York and became a licensed companion . " " She was a hooker . " Dallas glanced around the apartment . It was furnished in obsessive modern-glass and thin chrome , signed holograms on the walls , recessed bar in bold red . The wide mood screen behind the bar bled with mixing and merging shapes and colors in cool pastels . Neat as a virgin , Eve mused , and cold as a whore . " No surprise , given her choice of real estate . " " Politics makes it delicate . Victim was twenty-four , Caucasian female . She bought it in bed . " Eve only lifted a brow . " Seems poetic , since she 'd been bought there . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . I want you to see for yourself . " As they crossed the room , each took out a slim container , sprayed their hands front and back to seal in oils and fingerprints . At the doorway , Eve sprayed the bottom of her boots to slicken them so that she would pick up no fibers , stray hairs , or skin . Eve was already wary . Under normal circumstances there would have been two other investigators on a homicide scene , with recorders for sound and pictures . Forensics would have been waiting with their usual snarly impatience to sweep the scene . The fact that only Feeney had been assigned with her meant that there were a lot of eggshells to be walked over . " Security cameras in the lobby , elevator , and hallways , " Eve commented . " I 've already tagged the discs . " Feeney opened the bedroom door and let her enter first . It was n't pretty . Death rarely was a peaceful , religious experience to Eve 's mind . It was the nasty end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a stage deliberately set to offend . The bed was huge , slicked with what appeared to be genuine satin sheets the color of ripe peaches . Small , soft focused spotlights were trained on its center where the naked woman was cupped in the gentle dip of the floating mattress . The mattress moved with obscenely graceful undulations to the rhythm of programmed music slipping through the headboard . She was beautiful still , a cameo face with a tumbling waterfall of flaming red hair , emerald eyes that stared glassily at the mirrored ceiling , long , milk-white limbs that called to mind visions of Swan Lake as the motion of the bed gently rocked them . They were n't artistically arranged now , but spread lewdly so that the dead woman formed a final X dead-center of the bed . There was a hole in her forehead , one in her chest , another horribly gaping between the open thighs . Blood had splattered on the glossy sheets , pooled , dripped , and stained . There were splashes of it on the lacquered walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much blood was a rare thing , and she had seen much too much of it the night before to take the scene as calmly as she would have preferred . She had to swallow once , hard , and force herself to block out the image of a small child . " You got the scene on record ? " " Yep . " " Then turn that damn thing off . " She let out a breath after Feeney located the controls that silenced the music . The bed flowed to stillness . " The wounds , " Eve murmured , stepping closer to examine them . " Too neat for a knife . Too messy for a laser . " A flash came to her-old training films , old videos , old viciousness . " Christ , Feeney , these look like bullet wounds . " Feeney reached into his pocket and drew out a sealed bag . " Whoever did it left a souvenir . " He passed the bag to Eve . " An antique like this has to go for eight , ten thousand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fascinated , Eve turned the sealed revolver over in her hand . " It 's heavy , " she said half to herself . " Bulky . " " Thirty-eight caliber , " he told her . " First one I 've seen outside of a museum . This one 's a Smith and Wesson , Model Ten , blue steel . " He looked at it with some affection . " Real classic piece , used to be standard police issue up until the latter part of the twentieth . They stopped making them in about twenty-two , twenty-three , when the gun ban was passed . " " You 're the history buff . " Which explained why he was with her . " Looks new . " She sniffed through the bag , caught the scent of oil and burning . " Somebody took good care of this . Steel fired into flesh , " she mused as she passed the bag back to Feeney . " Ugly way to die , and the first I 've seen it in my ten years with the department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , Lower East Side , party got out of hand . Guy shot five people with a twenty-two before he realized it was n't a toy . Hell of a mess . " " Fun and games , " Eve murmured . " We 'll scan the collectors , see how many we can locate who own one like this . Somebody might have reported a robbery . " " Might have . " " It 's more likely it came through the black market . " Eve glanced back at the body . " If she 's been in the business for a few years , she 'd have discs , records of her clients , her trick books . " She frowned . " With Code Five , I 'll have to do the door-to-door myself . Not a simple sex crime , " she said with a sigh . " Whoever did it set it up . The antique weapon , the wounds themselves , almost ruler straight down the body , the lights , the pose . Who called it in , Feeney ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to him . " From right here . Called the station . See how the bedside unit 's aimed at her face ? That 's what came in . Video , no audio . " " He 's into showmanship . " Eve let out a breath . " Clever bastard , arrogant , cocky . He had sex with her first . I 'd bet my badge on it . Then he gets up and does it . " She lifted her arm , aiming , lowering it as she counted off , " One , two , three . " " That 's cold , " murmured Feeney . " He 's cold . He smooths down the sheets after . See how neat they are ? He arranges her , spreads her open so nobody can have any doubts as to how she made her living . He does it carefully , practically measuring , so that she 's perfectly aligned . Center of the bed , arms and legs equally apart . Does n't turn off the bed ' cause it 's part of the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know right away he 's no ordinary man . He 's got an ego . He does n't want to waste time letting the body be discovered eventually . He wants it now . That instant gratification . " " She was licensed for men and women , " Feeny pointed out , but Eve shook her head . " It 's not a woman . A woman would n't have left her looking both beautiful and obscene . No , I do n't think it 's a woman . Let 's see what we can find . Have you gone into her computer yet ? " " No . It 's your case , Dallas . I 'm only authorized to assist . " " See if you can access her client files . " Eve went to the dresser and began to carefully search drawers . Expensive taste , Eve reflected . There were several items of real silk , the kind no simulation could match . The bottle of scent on the dresser was exclusive , and smelled , after a quick sniff , like expensive sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded precisely , sweaters arranged according to color and material . The closet was the same . Obviously the victim had a love affair with clothes and a taste for the best and took scrupulous care of what she owned . And she 'd died naked . " Kept good records , " Feeney called out . " It 's all here . Her client list , appointments-including her required monthly health exam and her weekly trip to the beauty salon . She used the Trident Clinic for the first and Paradise for the second . " " Both top of the line . I 've got a friend who saved for a year so she could have one day for the works at Paradise . Takes all kinds . " " My wife 's sister went for it for her twenty-fifth anniversary . Cost damn near as much as my kid 's wedding . Hello , we 've got her personal address book . " " Good .
