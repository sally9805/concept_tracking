Your television flickers . You 're alone , your wife on a week-long visit to friends , so you watch the late news . Tonight is entirely about the Berlin Wall : the Germanies reunite , laughing and weeping Germans chip away at the Wall itself . One has a carpenter 's hammer , another a sledge , another a crowbar . The sight pleases you ; the days when the Berlin Wall seemed to rise layer by layer not through human labor but out of some evil magic are more alive in your mind than the day you 've just spent at the office . You feel old : you 've lived long enough to see both the beginning and the end of something that mattered in the world 's history . But your attention wo n't remain focused on that television screen ; instead , you keep drifting , as though your mind does n't want to give up this Wall , does n't want to lose anything which was ever part of the world you lived in . <p> You 're only six or seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grenade ! Dive for cover ! Kabloom , aaah , they me ! " You rod with the blast , lie still , and count to twenty-five , then clamber to your feet , creeping or dashing back into the struggle . Other soldiers , sneaking through the willows , act out the same death and rebirth , the death painless and the rebirth painless also ; and nothing , nothing ever permanent , nothing that could not be undone . <p> You crawl through the small willows , the dry grass scratching your stomach through your T-shirt , your empty BB gun pushed out ahead of you . You imagine that you look like the crawling soldier from your plastic Army set , the one who lies forever on his stomach , head up , right arm crooked to the side , palm flat against the earth ( or , more often , the linoleum on your bedroom floor ) , left arm holding the rifle shoved out in front . <p> The sun is hot , and the small river willows do n't give much shade in high summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the willows grow would be too wet to crawl through , even for six-year-olds . It feels like hours since you 've seen anyone , though it 's probably fifteen or twenty minutes . Your sense of time is imperfect as yet ; you have no idea how lucky that makes you . <p> Off to your left somewhere Karl and Jimmy , your allies , should also be crawling through this patch of willows growing next to the irrigation ditch which marks the town border . The enemy-Jerry , Michael , Bobby  --  started from the block 's other end . For a while both sides walked in a slight crouch  --  you know that is true of your side , and believe it of the other  --  then crouched more deeply , again modeling after those plastic soldiers , this time the ones whose back-bent crouch is permanent , rifle held low in one hand , the other out for balance . Finally , as you came closer to where the enemy should be , you decided to crawl . By then you had spread out , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Jerry 's house because your parents wo n't let you buy them . <p> But now you have n't seen anyone , not the enemy or Jimmy or Karl , for what seems like a long time . You 're on the south edge of the willows , closest to the irrigation ditch where it 's more open , where you can see better . That was your choice , and right now you 're not certain it was a good one : the little clearing just ahead is so open you do n't think you can crawl through without being shot , so you wait here at its edge , watching for the enemy . You hope Bobby 's opposite you ; he 's no better at this and he 's a year younger , a lot just now , and might show himself for you to shoot first . <p> The willows are n't large . The tallest tops out perhaps eight feet overhead , its trunk no more than an inch around . These are river willows ; they do n't get much larger , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a real forest someday , every tree as large as Dolven 's up the street , the one which weeps all the way to the ground in a circle big enough for six kids to get inside at once . Flies buzz ; you lift your head only slightly to peer at the willows across the clearing , afraid to rise enough to see much . You do n't hear anything but wind rustling the dry grass ; there 's almost always wind in this north country , summer , winter , spring , and fall . You wish a bird would come along , start to land on the other side , then flutter up , startled , like in the movies , so you 'd know that 's where the enemy is . <p> These enemies have no ideology . When you choose up sides for war , both are nameless . Only when two or three fight an imaginary enemy do you struggle against Germans or Nazis , which you think are different names for the same thing . Oddly , though there is a war on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those peoples . As nearly as you can remember , you do n't even fight Russians , though everyone knows they 're the most frightening of all . " Cowboys and Indians " is different ; sometimes you want to be an Indian , or a rustler , enemies whose freedom , even anarchy , somehow appeals . <p> On an afternoon later that fall you 'll smell burnt weeds as you walk home from the town 's only grade school  --  it 's not far , about a city block away from your home and this patch of willows across the street two blocks if you stay on the sidewalk instead of cutting through Michael ' s yard . The town is six blocks long by eight wide ; you do n't know how small that is because you 've seen Hogeland , which is two blocks by one . <p> On this afternoon you 'll be halfway home before you smell burnt weeds . It 's one of those October days when the wind does n't blow  --  there are maybe six quiet days a year , two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading only as far as Michael 's . Almost as soon as you begin wondering where the smell comes from , you see the whole south edge of the block has been burned black . The willows are gone the weeds are gone , there are n't even any sparks left . <p> It 's the kind of disruption , at six , you look at but do n't approach ; you wish you had n't cut through Michael 's yard and come this close . Safely inside your own house you ask your mother ; she says the town did it . When your father gets home , he says more : The willows choke the little drainage ditch , provide cover for mosquitoes , and , worse , puddles where mosquitoes can breed . Even at six you know enough mosquito-lore to understand . <p> After supper that evening , the neighborhood kids will gather along the street edge where the blackness begins : you and Jerry and Karl and Jimmy and Bobby and Michael , and your sisters , and the older guys who usually ignore you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a battle there . Jimmy mumbles , " God , what a mess , " not " Some scorched-earth policy , huh ? " and Michael mutters , " Jeez , they ruined it , " instead of staring over everyone 's head and pronouncing , " Looks like the town dropped the big one . " War means individual heroics , mostly single combat , maybe a GI with a tommy gun like gangsters used , holding off a dozen German or Japanese soldiers , or a pilot singly defeating a dozen enemy fighters . Saturation bombings , napalm , scorched earth , smart bombs , Agent Orange , are no part of your life ; nothing in that burnt-out field looks like war to you . <p> David , Jerry and Karl 's older brother , has gone to the real war in Korea . When the Berlin Wall falls , he will be a grandfather ; you will have read about it the week before in your hometown newspaper , which you subscribe to now for the first time in years . When the willows burn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You were pretty young when he went and do n't really remember him , but your parents say he exists and that 's good enough for you . <p> Your parents hope David exists ; he 's missing in action , his bomber shot down over North Korea . Only once can you remember anyone talking about that , when your mother told you not to play soldier in Jerry and Karl 's yard because David was missing in action and your game might remind his parents of how worried they were . The suggestion puzzles you ; you think parents can always tell how worried they are , which is usually a whole lot about nothing , but you like your mother , and you like Jerry and Karl 's parents , so you say yes . <p> It 's a difficult promise to keep . Jerry and Karl like to play Army , or cowboys and Indians , and their yard with its barn and granary and chicken coop and haystack and triple garage is a better place to play than the willows , where you ca n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowboys and Indians is almost as much fun , and you do n't remember their mother ever chasing you away for playing it . <p> Later your parents say something else : David 's a prisoner in Korea , no one knows when he 'll ever get home . But you know that sooner or later he will . Everyone comes home , always ; spat 's how things are , even if adults say prison camps are horrible places . No one will tell you in what ways they 're horrible , so you guess , end you guess some pretty bed things . Nothing you make up is as bad , you are still learning , as the reality : you are n't old enough , do n't know enough of horror , to imagine a genuine prison camp . Perhaps you 'll never be that old . <p> On this day , lying in the willows , the Army game is n't much fun . If anything , it 's kind of boring , but also , for some reason you do n't understand at all , frightening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies with rifles instead of toy Winchesters and empty BB guns . You find you ca n't move from your hiding place ; you lie there , afraid and sweating in the hot sun , the flies bothering you ( but no mosquitoes , not at mid-morning in the heat ) , and soon you 're so afraid you do n't even notice the sweat . <p> That 's where the memories end . Did you crawl out into the open ? Did someone blunder into your sights , have to count to twenty-five or even stay dead until everyone on one side or the other was also dead ? Did you lie , frozen and sweating , until everyone got bored and called a truce , went off to climb Jerry and Karl 's haystack ? All these years , and you ca n't move beyond the heat and the inexplicable fear . <p> Your late-night television flickers as the Berlin Wall portion of that fear begins to dissolve into chips and splinters . Someone is already selling fragments for souvenirs . You ca n't yet chuckle at any irony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
