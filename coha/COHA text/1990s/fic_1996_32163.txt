One Cottonmouth could not take his eyes from the young woman warrior who lay on her stomach before him . Feathers of long hair haloed her beautiful face , looking startlingly black against the white sand . Her short tunic , the color of dry grass , had been woven from the finest palm thread , and painted with the green images of bobcat , whale , and dolphin . In the past half a hand of time , so much blood had run from her wound that it had pooled , red and glistening , at her side . As his men moved among the dead , the amber gleam of their torches reflected in that pool like flashes of lightning . Cottonmouth forced a shallow breath into his lungs . Every wet scent of the night smelled incredibly clear to him , as if it had soaked into his flesh and been carried through his veins like a powerful Spirit plant . The sweetness of the coastal pines mixed with the salty fragrances of fish and sea , and the earthiness of the rain storm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dart had pierced her back just below the shoulder blades , she had fallen , then weakly pushed up and tried to crawl away . When she could go no further , she had stiffened her trembling arms and legs , keeping herself upright so that she might turn and defiantly stare him in the eyes . The shock of seeing that face had been like a hard fist in his stomach . Blessed Sun Mother , how many times had he gazed into thoseeyes in his dreams ? How many times had he tenderly touched that face ? Clenching his hands to nerve himself , he walked forward and knelt beside the young woman . Huge , amorphous shadows swayed through the trees as a few of his warriors lifted their torches momentarily to watch him , curious . He had lost only two men in the battle . The remaining ten-and-eight moved through the camp , laughing and joking , kicking over the bodies , ripping Power bundles from around throats , plundering the dead for trinkets to take home to their wives and children . Against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they seemed somehow unreal ... more like scavenging ghosts floating over the sand than living men . Cottonmouth broke off the dart shaft and flung it away . His heart had started to pound . He slipped his arms beneath the girl 's knees and shoulders , and clutched her slender body against his bare chest . Blood leaked from her wound , running warmly down his muscular belly and legs , soaking his breechclout . His long , graying black hair fell over her face as he lifted her and rose to his feet . Disapproving murmurs came from his warriors . The customs of their clan , the Standing Hollow Horn Clan , demanded that enemies killed in battle be left for scavengers . If their relatives did not find the dead within two days , their souls would justly be condemned to wander the earth forever . Mulberry , a small skinny youth , stepped forward and lifted his torch so that it glared in Cottonmouth 's eyes , forcing him to squint . The boy had coiled his black hair into a bun and fixed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spirit Elder , " he said sternly . " We must leave the dead . " He cast a worried look over his shoulder . " The men expect it . " Cottonmouth stared at his warriors . They shifted uncomfortably . Anger creased Mulberry 's young face , hardening his jaw . Boldly , he stepped closer . " Elder , our men do not wish this filth to enter the afterworld and live among our relatives ! " Terse whispers passed back and forth . " Have you searched the dead for Diver ? " Cottonmouth asked . The very softness of his voice held threat . " Or did you allow him to escape ? " Mulberry tried to scowl , but his resolve quickly faltered and he wet his thin lips . " I ... n-no . Not yet . " " He is about my age , four-tens-and-five or five tens of summers . I will return soon . When I do , I will wish to know where he is . You had better have an answer for me . " Cottonmouth walked away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against his , the silken feel of her long black hair tumbling down his side . When he had first seen her , he 'd stumbled and almost fallen . Only after moments of agony had he realized she must be Morning Glory , daughter of Musselwhite , and not Musselwhite herself -- but she looked so much like her mother with those high cheekbones , that turned-up nose , and those fierce brown eyes , that he had been stunned and unable to take his gaze from her . Cool wind blew across his face . Sister Moon shone so brightly tonight that every blade of grass threw a shadow . As he rounded the northern edge of a clearing , he could make out the gangly shape of a blue heron standing on one foot in the meadow , and a short distance further , a snowy egret . On the western side of the clearing an ancient oak had fallen long ago , blocking the path . Great crooked branches held the heavy trunk off the ground . He would have to crawl through on his knees , then drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft pile of old leaves and slid under on his stomach . Powerful scents of wet bark and packrat dung stung his nose . He emerged on the opposite side and turned . When he reached through the tangle to grasp her wrist , her fingers had stiffened , raking his arms like curled talons . He tugged . She moved , then stopped abruptly . He jerked harder and heard the sound of ripping fabric as her short tunic tore free from a snag . She came through on her stomach , her face in the dirt . The sight pained him . Blood trickled darkly from her back wound . Cottonmouth sat down beside her and brushed the dirt from her smooth cheeks and forehead , but drew back his hand when he noticed that one of her eyes had opened . He did not want to look into those eyes again , though tens of times , in a dozen battles , he had lived only for that sight . He gently spread her hair over-her face , then picked her up and carried her on down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the green grass , placing her in the same spot her mother had lain two tens and six summers before . Musselwhite had been laughing when they 'd loved each other . Since that day the world had changed . The forest had grown up around their secret places . Deadfall had accumulated , filling the spaces between the trees . No lovers came here now . It saddened Cottonmouth , for he could recall very clearly bright days when he and Musselwhite had walked here and felt Brother Earth 's age like a warm cape upon their shoulders . This forest had held a stillness so great they could sense the wingbeats of the Spirit birds who flew around them . They had spent days listening to the trees sing . Each had its own distinct voice , and when they sang together , a harmony of extraordinary majesty filled the world . Cottonmouth 's sandals sank into the damp soil as he went in search of sticks to stake Morning Glory 's body down . If she had been a member of his clan , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rare shells and precious stone tools -- but she was not , and he had n't much time . Already his warriors would be growing restless , worrying about his odd behavior , ready to go home to their wives ' beds . Cottonmouth sifted through a pile of deadfall until he had selected nine sticks with sharp points . He tucked them into his belt , and went back to Morning Glory 's side . " I will Sing you to the afterworld , " he murmured and began the Death Song in a low voice , just loud enough that the three strands of her braided soul could hear . I have come with living waters , To give these healing ways of the Wolves , these healing ways of the living water Wolves . Look northward now , down the pathway of living waters to the Wolves in the Village of Wounded Souls . Hear them call you ? They are calling you , calling , calling . Gripping her by the ankles , he walked into the pond . Cold water swirled around his knees . Her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floated in a wealth of sinuous black hair . Through that half-open eye she watched him . He rolled Morning Glory onto her left side , then turned her so that she faced north . " Look northward . Do you see the tunnel that leads to the Village of Wounded Souls ? All ponds are openings to that distant afterworld , you know . You have a long way to swim , but there will be Spirit Helpers to guide you . Wait for Alligator , he 'll show you the way . " With great care , he tucked her knees against her chest and drove one of his stakes through her sandal laces to keep her feet in place . The rest of the stakes he drove through the bloody fabric of her tunic , securing her to the bottom of the pond so she would not float free and lose sight of the tunnel . Black hair writhed in slow motion over Morning Glory 's face , covering her open eye , but her perfect body lay calm and still beneath the glimmering veil of moonlit water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for tens of tens of summers , rather than a single hand of time . Cottonmouth waded out of the pond and piled logs around the edges of the grassy strip , blocking the gaps in the deadfall , making certain no animals could enter and drag her from her grave . Sister Moon 's luminous face hung high above him . The Shining People had retreated to the far edges of her radiance , patiently waiting for her to sink into the Village of Wounded Souls so their own splendor could burst forth again . Tomorrow Cottonmouth would order several warriors to return to the battle site and track down and capture each enemy who had escaped . Two or three days from now , Musselwhite would start to panic , wondering what had happened to her husband and children , fearing the worst . It would not take long for her to mount a search party . She would do it over vehement protests from the Spirit Elders , who would warn her that if she left , the village would be almost defenseless . But she would leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother herself to keep her relatives from falling into Cottonmouth 's hands . For two-tens-and-six summers his bitterness had been festering , eating him alive . She would rightly fear what tactics he might use to repay that old debt of honor . He looked up to watch the bats flitting through the darkness , their wings flashing in the moonlight , and wondered what he would do when she came . The ache in his chest grew overpowering . He dropped his head in his hands , and closed his eyes . He knew only that he would be waiting for her . Continues ...
