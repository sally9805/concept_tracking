<p> The chives come up first in my little herb garden . Bright green spikes push their way up through dry , brown leaves . I put them in butter for steaks and grilled shrimp . I roll them in rice paper with match-stick vegetables to dip in peanut sauce . <p> The tiny rosemary trees that decorated the table for Christmas are now a foot tall in the kitchen window . They bush out over bare stalks , like topiaries . I 've trimmed them to flavor bruschetta , veal shanks and warm potato salad . <p> Now the sage is coming back . I ca n't wait . <p> Herbs give me a sense of history more than any other plants . And I love the lore . " There 's rosemary , that 's for remembrance  --  pray you , love , remember , " said Ophelia . The Romans , it is told , wore crowns made of parsley . There are reports that women in the Middle Ages embroidered thyme and bees on the scarves worn by knights , as a symbol of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few weeks , herb plants will be available in abundance at area farmers ' markets and garden-supply outlets  --  even supermarkets . With some sun and proper drainage , they will thrive in pots , window boxes or garden plots to enhance your menus all year . Last fall , I picked sage leaves from my garden into December . <p> Fresh herbs can give life and interest to old recipe standbys . As the mint began to send its roots through the patio bricks , I learned to put it in warm sauces for roasts of lamb , in a salsa verde for tacos and with cilantro and yogurt to season broiled bass . A bit of tarragon in soft scrambled eggs is lovely , but for how many Sunday brunches ? Instead , I tucked some , with chives , under the skin of a chicken . Voila ! <p> If you do n't have the space or the inclination to grow your own herbs , you can purchase a good variety in bunches . The Fresh Fields/Whole Foods stores will have local organic spearmint and peppermint this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The farmers ' markets and the Bethesda Coop offer many local cut herbs as well as plants . <p> It 's a treat to have fresh herb-flavored vinegars and oils . Try steeping thyme , parsley and chives with peppercorns in a pint of white-wine vinegar . Strain it after two or three weeks and use it in salads and marinades . <p> Warm a mild oil with your favorite herbs in the oven at its lowest setting . Sometimes I add a little citrus peel as well . Strain and use on vegetables and fish for the grill , warm toast or in chicken salad . Refrigerate any oil that you do not use right away and use it within a few days . Oil will not curtail the growth of bacteria and you risk serious infection if it is kept too long . Freshly flavored oils are best , anyway . <p> Tired of the same old hummus ? Add some mint . Getting weary of plain polenta ? Throw in some chopped marjoram , chervil or chives .
