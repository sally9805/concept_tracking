From the moment Grant Morgan saw the woman , he knew thatdespite her beautyshe would never be any man 's bride . He followed the waterman through the swirls of fog , cold mist clinging to his skin and forming beads on his wool coat . He kept both hands shoved deep in his pockets , while his gaze chased restlessly around the scene . The river looked oily in the dull glow of lamps hung on the massive blocks of granite near the landing . Two or three tiny boats ferried passengers across the Thames , bobbing like toys on the water . Chilly waves lapped against the steps and face of an embankment wall . A wintry March breeze curled around Grant 's face and ears and slipped persistently beneath the edge of his cravat . He suppressed a shiver as he stared at the sloshing black river . No one could survive much longer than twenty minutes in water that cold . " Where is the body ? " An impatient frown tugged at Grant 's brow . He reached inside his coat , fingering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have all night . " The Thames waterman stumbled as he twisted his head to glance at the man following him . The drifting mist surrounded them in a yellow-gray haze , causing him to squint in the effort to see better . " Ye 're Morgan , are n't ye ? Mr. Morgan hisself ... Why , no one will believe it when I tell ' em . A man who guards the king ... I would ha ' thought you above such dirty business as this . " " Unfortunately not , " Grant muttered . " This way , sir ... and mind yer step . The stairs is awful slick by the water , specially on a dampnight like this . " Stiffening his jaw , Grant made his way down to the small , soaked form that had been hauled onto the landing stairs . In the course of his detective work he often saw dead bodies , but drowning victims were surely among the most unpleasant . The body had been left facedown , but it was clearly female . She was spread akimbo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skirts of her dress heaped in a dripping mass around her legs . Crouching beside her , Grant clasped the woman 's shoulder with a leather-gloved hand and began to turn her over . He recoiled instantly , startled , as she began to cough and retch salt water , her body spasming . The waterman yelped in terror behind him , then drew nearer . " I thought she was dead . " His voice shook with amazement . " She was cold meat , I swear it ! " " Idiot , " Grant muttered . How long had this poor woman been left in the bitter cold while the waterman had sent for a Bow Street Runner to investigate ? Her chances of survival would have been far greater had she been taken care of immediately . As it was , her odds were n't good . He flipped the woman over and lifted her head to his knee , her long hair soaking his trousers . Her skin was ashen in the murky light , and there was a swelling lump on the side of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were recognizable . He knew her . " My God , " Grant breathed . He made a point of never being surprised by anything ... but to find Vivien Rose Duvall here , like this ... It was inconceivable . Her eyes half opened , dull with the knowledge of her imminent death . But Vivien was not the kind of woman to slip away without a struggle . She whimpered and reached upward , her hand brushing the front of his waistcoat in a feeble attempt to save herself . Spurred into action , Grant locked his arms around her and hauled her upward . She was small and compact , but the skirts of her waterlogged gown nearly doubled her weight . Grant held her high against his chest , giving a grunt of discomfort as the icy salt water soaked through his own clothes . " Will you take ' er to Bow Street , Mr. Morgan ? " the waterman chattered , hastening to follow Grant as he took the steps two at a time . " I ' spect I should go too , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone a favor , did n't I , finding the lady afore she croaked . I would n't take no thanks , o ' course ... just to do the right thing is enough ... but there might be a reward , might n't there ? " " Find Dr. Jacob Linley , " Grant said harshly , interrupting the man 's eager speculation . " He 's usually at Tom 's coffeehouse this time of night . Tell him to come to my residence at King Street . " " I ca n't , " the waterman protested . " I ' as to work , ye know ... Why , I could earn five shillings yet tonight . " " You 'll be paid when you bring Linley to King Street . " " But what if I ca n't find ' im ? " " You 'll bring him there within a half hour , " Grant said curtly , " or I 'll have your boat confiscatedand I 'll arrange a three-day stay for you in a prison hulk . Is that motivation enough ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waterman said sourly , " until I met you . You 're not a-tall like they write you in the papers . Hours I 've spent in the taverns whilst they read aloud about yer doings ... " He trotted away , disappointment evident in every line of his squatty form . Grant 's mouth curved in grim amusement . He was well aware of the way his exploits were described in the papers . Editors and writers had exaggerated his accomplishments until he was made to seem superhuman . People regarded him as a legend , not as a normal man with flaws . He had made the job of Bow Street Runner into a highly profitable one , earning a fortune from recovering stolen property for banks . He had , on occasion , taken other kinds of caseslocating an abducted heiress , serving as a personal guard to a visiting monarch , tracking down murderersbut banks were always his preferred clients . With each case solved , his name had garnered more celebrity , until he was discussed in every coffee shop and tavern in London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its bejeweled bosom , clamoring for his presence at their social functions . It was said that a ball 's success was assured if the hostess was able to write " Mr. Morgan will attend " at the bottom of the invitation . Yet for all his apparent popularity with the nobility , it was clear to all that he was not one of them . He was more a figure of entertainment than an accepted member of the high social circles he frequented . Women were excited by the notion that he was a potentially dangerous character , and men wanted his friendship in order to appear more brave and worldly themselves . Grant was aware that he would never be accepted except in the most superficial way . And he would never be trusted by the ton ... He knew too many of their dirty secrets , their vulnerabilities , their fears and desires . A gust of frosty air whirled around him , making the woman in his arms moan and tremble . Clutching his unwieldy burden more tightly , he left the embankment and crossed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a small , square court filled with stagnant water barrels , a fetid pigsty , and a cart with broken wheels . Covent Garden was littered with courts like these , from which dark , winding rookeries spread out in disease-ridden webs . Any gentleman in his right mind would be terrified to venture in this area of the city , rife with thieves ' kitchens , whores , bullies , and criminals who would kill for a few shillings . But Grant was hardly a gentleman , and the London underworld held no terrors for him . The woman 's head lolled on his shoulder , her weak , cool breath hitting his chin . " Well , Vivien , " he murmured , " there was a time I wanted you in my arms ... but this was n't exactly what I had planned . " He found it hard to believe he was carrying London 's most desirable female past Covent Garden 's tumbledown booths and open stalls . Butchers and peddlers paused to stare curiously as he passed , while prostitutes ventured from the shadows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman called , " got a nice fresh cream pot for ye ! " " Some other time , " Grant said sarcastically , ignoring the whore 's eager cawing . He crossed the northwest corner of the square and reached King Street , where the decaying buildings turned abruptly into a row of tidy town houses , coffeehouses , and a publisher or two . It was a clean , prosperous street with bow-fronted houses inhabited by the upper class . Grant had purchased an elegant , airy three-story air town house there . The busy headquarters at Bow Street was only a short step away , but it seemed far removed from this serene location . Swiftly Grant mounted the steps of his town house and gave the mahogany door a resounding kick . When there was no response from within , he drew back and kicked again . Suddenly the door opened and his housekeeper appeared , spluttering with protests at his cavalier treatment of the polished wood paneling . Mrs. Buttons was a pleasant-faced woman in her fifties , kind of heart but bottled-up , steel-spined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no secret that she disapproved of Grant 's chosen profession , abhorring the physical violence and corruption he dealt with as a matter of course . Yet she tirelessly received the wide assortment of underworld callers who came to the town house , treating all with equal parts of politeness and reserve . Like the other Bow Street Runners who worked under the direction of Sir Ross Cannon , Grant had become so immersed in the world of darkness that he sometimes questioned how much difference there was between himself and the criminals he pursued . Mrs. Buttons had once told Grant of her hopes that he would someday step into the light of Christian truth . " I 'm beyond saving , " he had replied cheerfully . " You 'd better direct your ambitions toward an attainable goal , Mrs. Buttons . " As she beheld the dripping burden in her employer 's arms , the housekeeper 's normally unflappable face went slack with amazement . " Good Lord ! " Mrs. Buttons exclaimed . " What happened ? " Grant 's muscles were beginning to tire from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A near drowning , " he said curtly , pushing past the housekeeper as he headed for the stairs . " I 'm taking her to my room . " " But how ? Who ? " Mrs. Buttons gasped , making a visible effort to recover herself . " Should n't she be brought to a hospital ? " " She 's an acquaintance of mine , " he said . " I want her seen by a private doctor . God knows what they would do to her at a hospital . " " An acquaintance , " the housekeeper repeated , hurrying to keep pace with his rapid strides . It was clear she was burning to know more , but would n't presume to ask . " A lady of the evening , actually , " Grant said dryly . " A lady of the ... and you 've brought her here ... " Her voice reeked with disapproval . " Sir , once again you have outdone yourself . " A brief grin crossed his face . " Thank you . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Morgan , would n't you prefer to have one of the guest rooms prepared ? " " She 'll stay in mine , " he said in a tone that quashed further argument . Frowning , Mrs. Buttons directed a housemaid to wipe up the puddles they had left on the inlaid floors of the amber marble entranceway . The town house , with its long windows , Sheraton furniture , and English hand-knotted carpets , was the kind of place Grant had once never dared to dream of living in . It was a far cry from the crowded flat he had occupied as a small child , three rooms crammed with the eight offspring of a middle-class bookseller and his wife . Or the succession of orphanages and workhouses that had come later , when his father had been thrown into debtor 's prison and the family had fallen to pieces . Grant had eventually found himself on the streets , until a Covent Garden fishmonger had taken pity and given him steady work and a pallet to sleep on at night . Snuggled up against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something better , something more , though his dreams had never taken precise shape until the day he met a Bow Street Runner . The Runner had been patrolling the jostling market square and had caught a thief who had snatched a fish from the fishmonger 's stall . Grant had stared wide-eyed at the Runner in his smart red waistcoat , armed with cutlass and pistols . He had seemed larger , finer , more powerful than ordinary men . Grant had immediately known that his only hope of escaping the life he had been consigned to was to become a Runner . He had enlisted in the Foot Patrol at age eighteen , was promoted to the Day Patrol within a year , and a few months later was chosen by Sir Ross Cannon to complete the elite force of a half dozen Bow Street Runners . To prove his worthiness , Grant had hurled himself into his work with unflagging zeal , treating each case as if it required a personal sense of vengeance . He went to any lengths to catch a culprit , once following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As success mounted on success , Grant had begun to charge exorbitant fees for his private services , which had only made him more sought-after . Acting on advice from a wealthy client who owed him a favor , Grant had invested in shipping and textile companies , purchased a half interest in a hotel , and bought several choice pieces of property on the west side of London . With some luck and determination , he had climbed far higher than God or man had intended . At age thirty , he could retire with a comfortable fortune . But he could n't bring himself to resign from the Bow Street force . The thrill of the chase , the lure of danger , were strong , almost physical needs he could never seem to satisfy . He did n't care to dwell on exactly why he could n't settle down and lead a normal life , but he was certain it did n't speak well of his character . Reaching his bedroom , Grant brought Vivien to the massive mahogany tester bed with draped swags carved at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed , had been specially made to suit his proportions . He was a tall , big-framed man , for whom the tops of doorframes and ceiling beams posed a frequent hazard . " Oh , the counterpane ! " Mrs. Buttons exclaimed as Vivien 's clothes saturated the heavy velvet embroidered with gold and blue silk . " It will be ruined beyond repair ! " " Then I 'll buy another , " Grant said , flexing his sore arms and stripping off his drenched coat . He dropped his coat to the floor and bent over Vivien 's still form . Intent on removing her clothes as quickly as possible , he tugged at the front of her gown . A curse escaped his lips as the buttons and hooks remained obstinately entrenched in the shrunken wet wool . Grumbling about the damage that was being done to the velvet counterpane , Mrs. Buttons endeavored to assist him , then pulled back with a frustrated sigh . " They 'll have to be cut off her , I suppose . Shall I fetch the scissors ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a smooth move born of long habit , he extracted an ivory-handled knife with a six-inch spearpoint blade . The housekeeper gaped as he began to cut through the gown 's thick woven bodice as if it were butter . " Oh , my , " she faltered . Grant focused intently on the work at hand . " No one can wield a knife like a former Covent Garden fishmonger , " he remarked dryly , spreading the sides of the gown wide to reveal a wealth of white linen undergarments . Vivien 's chemise was soaked and plastered to her snowy skin , revealing the rose-colored points of her nipples beneath . Although Grant had seen countless female bodies , something about Vivien 's barely clad form made him hesitate . He struggled with the unaccountable feeling that he was violating somethingsomeonetender and virginal . Ludicrous , considering the fact that Vivien Duvall was an accomplished courtesan . " Mr. Morgan , " the housekeeper said , fidgeting with the edges of her large white apron , " if you would prefer , I can have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Duvall , " Grant supplied softly . " Miss Duvall 's garments . " " I 'll see to our guest , " Grant murmured . " I 'll wager at least a regiment 's worth of men have had the privilege of seeing Miss Duvall naked She 'd be the first to say , Get the job done and modesty be damned . ' " Besides , after the trouble he 'd gone to tonight , he was entitled to this one small pleasure . " Yes , sir . " She gave him an odd , considering look , as if he were n't quite behaving like himself . And perhaps he was n't . A strange feeling suffused him , the chill from the outside mingling with a heat that burned at his core . Stone-faced , Grant continued to cut away the wet clothes , slicing through one sleeve and then the other . As he lifted Vivien 's slim upper torso and yanked the sodden wool from beneath her , someone walked through the half-open door and gasped loudly . It was Kellow , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and a pair of round spectacles settled firmly on his nose . His eyes seemed to fill the spectacle lenses as he beheld his employer standing with a knife over the half-clad body of the unconscious woman . " Oh , dear God ! " Grant turned to fix him with a ferocious scowl . " Try to be of some use , will you ? Get one of my shirts . And some towels . And now that I think of it , some tea and brandy . Now , hurry . " Kellow started to reply , appeared to think better of it , and proceeded to fetch the required articles . Carefully averting his eyes from the woman on the bed , he handed a fresh shirt to Mrs. Buttons and fled the room . Grant 's growing need to have Vivien clothed and warm overrode any desire to see her naked . He caught only a brief glimpse of her body as he and the housekeeper worked to pull Vivien 's arms through the long linen sleeves ... but his brain gathered the image greedily and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the promise of delight was captured in her imperfections . She was charmingly short-waisted , as so many petite women were , with gorgeous round breasts and softly dimpled knees . Her smooth abdomen was crowned with a triangle of spicy red hair just a few shades darker than the sunset locks on her head . No wonder she was the most highly paid prostitute in England . She was lush , pretty , dainty ... the kind of woman any man would want to keep in bed for days . They weighted Vivien with linens and heavy blankets , and Mrs. Buttons wrapped her stiff , salt-tainted hair in one of the towels Kellow had brought . " She 's a lovely woman , " the housekeeper said , her face softening with reluctant pity . " And young enough to change her life for the better . I hope the Lord will choose to spare her . " " She wo n't die , " Grant said shortly . " I wo n't allow it . " He touched the pure ivory curve of Vivien 's forehead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath the towel . Carefully he laid a cold cloth over a bruise at her temple . " Though it seems someone will be disappointed by her survival . " " Pardon , sir , but I do n't follow ... oh . " Her eyes widened as Grant 's fingertips swept gently over Vivien 's throat , indicating the shadowy bruises that encircled her slim neck . " It looks as if someone tried to ... to ... " " Strangle her , " he said matter-of-factly . " Who would do such a thing ? " Mrs. Buttons wondered aloud , her forehead creased with horror . " Most often in the case of a murdered woman , it 's a husband or lover . " His lips twitched with a humorless smile . " Females always seem to fear strangers , when it 's usually the men they know who do them harm . " Shaking her head at the ugly thought , Mrs. Buttons stood and smoothed her apron . " If it pleases you , sir , I 'll send up some salve for Miss Duvall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctor 's arrival . " Grant nodded , barely aware of the housekeeper leaving the room as he stared at Vivien 's expressionless face . Gently he rearranged the cloth on her forehead . He stroked the curve of her pale cheek with a single fingertip , and made a sound of grim amusement in his throat . " I swore you would rue the day you made a fool of me , Vivien , " he murmured . " But the opportunity has come a hell of lot sooner than I expected . "
