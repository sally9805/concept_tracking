As German bombers struck 50 years ago , Britain was ready with a newfangled system that became its first line of defense : radar <p> A few years before the outbreak of World War II , Britain realized that it had no adequate defense against Germany 's fast-growing air force . Nazi bombs , it seemed , would soon set London ablaze . Located less than 30 miles from the sea , the city was the " greatest target in the world , " said Winston Churchill , a " fat cow tied up to attract the beasts of prey . " Speaking to the House of Commons in 1932 , Stanley Baldwin , Britain 's future prime minister , told his nation that it could not expect any protection : " I think it is well also for the man in the street to realize that there is no power on earth that can protect him from being bombed . Whatever people may tell him , the bomber will always get through . " <p> Not everyone agreed . Here and there creative thinkers  --  military and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop the bomber . Wild schemes emerged : <p> * Steel wires or nets , hung from balloons , could snag incoming planes ; <p> * Clouds , somehow frozen solid , could provide platforms for mounting antiaircraft guns ; <p> * British bombers , flying even higher than the enemy , could release swarms of mines that would float down on parachutes to explode in the faces of hostile pilots ; <p> * " Death rays " using ultraviolet rays or x rays or radio waves could knock attackers from the sky ; <p> * Massive sound locators , installed along the coast , could listen for the roar of bomber engines . <p> Exactly 50 years ago , as German planes began to sweep over England to prepare the way for a Nazi invasion , the survival of Britain  --  and thus the survival of any significant opposition to the forces of Adolf Hitler  --  hung on the evolution of one of those wild schemes . One of them had to stop the beasts of prey . And in fact one of them would become the early-warning system now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost universally by its acronym , RADAR . <p> As David E. Fisher explains in his excellent book A Race on the Edge of Time , " Britain 's Royal Air Force ( RAF ) had realized for a long time that it needed to find something that could work . By 1934 , the British knew that Hitler was building up Germany 's air force , the Luftwaffe , aiming for 4,000 bombers  --  presumably capable of overwhelming the RAF 's 330 fighter planes . That summer , the RAF staged a trial of its fighters ' ability to intercept attacking bombers . They failed miserably . Although many of the mock attackers flew far more slowly than any Luftwaffe bomber would , most of them cruised to their targets without encountering any opposition . The RAF pilots simply could not find incoming bombers in the vast sky . <p> Soon after that embarrassment , the RAF officer in charge of research and development , Air Marshal Sir Hugh ( Stuffy ) Dowding , traveled to an air base south of London for a demonstration of the scheme that seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound locator . He saw a curved wall 200 feet long by 25 feet high and studded with microphones . Britain 's Air Ministry intended to build similar listening devices along the headlands and beaches east of London in the hopes of detecting the thrum of oncoming bombers as early as possible . <p> Shortly before the demonstration was scheduled to begin , a milkman appeared , driving his horse and cart , his milk cans clanking away . The would-be defenders of Britain rushed off and reprimanded the noisy intruder , who fell silent . But Dowding was no fool . The Luftwaffe , he knew , would not agree to attack only in Britain 's quiet moments . <p> The sound locator failure gave new life to an old , wild scheme  --  a " death ray " to knock pilots and planes from the sky . As early as 1916 , a British commander in chief had watched while an inventor zapped two rabbits with his new ray . After a few minutes the rabbits died , but only because they had been poisoned . Later , other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In early 1935 the Air Ministry requested a new death ray evaluation from the superintendent of the nation 's Radio Research Station , a mercurial Scot named Robert Watson Watt . Could radio waves , the ministry wondered , be transmitted with enough power to knock out enemy pilots ? <p> In Watson Watt , a physicist , Britain 's defense problem had found its man . Irreverent , chubby , clubby and , perhaps most important , intolerant of the " drab scum of routine , " Watson Watt apparently saw himself as a salesman of ideas awaiting his one great marketing opportunity . Alas for him , the death ray question presented itself as , fundamentally , a problem in mathematics  --  perhaps his worst subject . To give his destiny and his math a boost , he turned to one of his most skilled assistants , Arnold ( Skip ) Wilkins , also a physicist . Without explaining his purpose , Watson Watt posed an odd problem : imagine that eight pints of water at 98 degrees Fahrenheit is suspended five kilometers away and one kilometer high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how much radio power would you have to transmit toward it ? <p> Wilkins quickly decoded the question . Eight pints of water at 98 degrees Fahrenheit equals , more or less , a human being . A human being suspended one kilometer in the air is probably a pilot . A pilot whose blood temperature rises suddenly to 105 degrees is unsafe at any speed . Watson Watt was asking for the power demands of a death ray . <p> Those demands , Wilkins ' math showed , could not be met , but out of that abortive collaboration emerged the seeds of a new scheme that resulted in what is now called radar . Its paternity remains in dispute even today , but Watson Watt reveled in calling himself the father of radar . On February 12 , 1935 , he submitted the draft of a rather technical memo to Britain 's new Committee for the Scientific Survey of Air Defence . He urged that Britain use radio to ring its shores with " an invisible curtain " ( as Watson Watt would put it years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtain would be erected by a series of radio transmitters that would generate " loud , short , sharp radio bangs . " A series of receiving devices would listen for echoes and count the millionths of a second between bang and echo . Each ten-millionths of a second represented roughly a mile . A plane 's distance in miles could thus be displayed on the glowing screen of a cathode-ray tube . <p> With a bit more calculating , the echoes could also give clues to a plane 's direction and height . A friendly plane could even carry a device that would respond to its own nation 's radar bangs  --  automatically sending back , along with the echo , a signal allowing radar operators to distinguish friend from foe . <p> On paper , radar sounded ready to guard Britain . The committee asked for military seed money . Its request stopped with Stuffy Dowding  --  still in charge of RAF research . After the fiasco of the concrete sound locators , he was skeptical about wild schemers . Wars are n't fought with math on scraps of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast . <p> Handed another tough problem , Watson Watt again turned to the indispensable Wilkins . Without money , he asked , how could a nonexistent system be prepared for an almost-immediate test ? <p> Wilkins swiftly located a British Broadcasting Corporation transmitter in Northamptonshire that sent the kind of radio waves that he hoped would create good echoes . He gathered some receiving gear he hoped would work . On the day before the crucial test , he loaded the gear into an old Morris van , drove to a farmer 's field not far from the transmitter , and started setting up aerials and batteries and cathode-ray equipment . Night fell . To prepare the receiver , he needed to tune it to the BBC radio waves , which would cut off at midnight . He had no light ; his assistant began striking matches . Wilkins worked to connect wire after wire . The night turned cold and froze the mud beneath them . By midnight , the work was done . <p> The next morning , February 26 , Watson Watt arrived for the test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air Ministry and his own nephew , who had come along for the ride . As planned , an RAF bomber flew overhead . The BBC radio waves , bouncing off the bomber , allowed Wilkins ' receiver to follow the bomber for about eight miles . <p> Watson Watt and the Air Ministry observer said almost nothing . They just left Wilkins to pack up , jumped in the Daimler and dashed for London . But apparently they were thrilled quite out of their minds : after several miles spent predicting radar 's rosy future , they abruptly realized they had abandoned Watson Watt 's young nephew to wander in the mud of an empty field . They sped back to get him . The next day , Stuffy Dowding authorized 10,000 pounds for the top-secret creation of radar . <p> With this relatively modest sum , Watson Watt and Wilkins began what they believed was a race against time . They aimed for success by 1938 , when Watson Watt predicted war with Germany . What neither of them seemed to realize is that they were racing not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year earlier , for example , Russian radar had detected airplanes almost two miles away , and French radar had detected planes three miles high . Italy and America had also begun radar work . But the worst news for the British , had they known it , would have come from Germany . <p> German radar had a long history . In 1904 , a German inventor had demonstrated a radio obstacle-detector to help navigate ships through fog ; the German Navy had shown no interest . Later , in 1916 , with their nation at war , two Germans proposed a radio target-detector to help aim guns at night ; they said they could have it ready in six months . The navy replied : too late , because the war would not last so long . Finally , in 1933 , the German military awoke to radar . A year later , its navy had demonstrated a device that could detect a ship at seven miles and a plane at almost half a mile , and the government had authorized further development . <p> By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were already far behind . For their secret mission , they needed a secret site . Watson Watt chose perhaps the most forbidding research station in England , a remote gravel spit known as Orfordness . Its low and flinty strand divided barren Suffolk marshes from the harsh North Sea . Reached by ferry across a tidal river that had taken many lives , blown over by hail and sleet , Orfordness offered its crew a life of hardship . <p> The easy-living Watson Watt did not assume management of the hardscrabble site . Instead , he entrusted Orfordness to the man who was all that he was not  --  the man who was granite to his mercury , patience to his impatience , sinew to his flab , quiet to his noise  --  the unflappable Skip Wilkins . At Orfordness , Wilkins quickly set to work with a small team  --  half a dozen , all told . Watson Watt blew in on weekends to stay at a nearby inn . There he impressed his team with the imminence of Armageddon , telling them that " every week that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to count our own . " There also he entertained guests , to whom he sometimes exaggerated what his team had accomplished . For him , Orfordness was a place where " a small group of young men , led by one not so young "  --  himself , of course  --  " lived and breathed their enterprise , and they talked about it at breakfast , at lunch , at dinner , in the boat crossing to the Island and in the hotel sittingroom , until it was time to go to bed . " <p> Racing to overtake Watson Watt 's exaggerations , the team made dramatic progress . Soon they were tracking airplanes at distances of 40 and then 80 miles offshore . Near the end of 1935 , responding to those successes , the British Treasury allocated l million pounds to create five radar stations along the coast east of London . And then , as if to give the radar team a token of its esteem , for a mere 24,000 pounds the Treasury bought them a new home . <p> Headquarters became Bawdsey Manor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. Cuthbert Quilter . Just south of Orfordness , Bawdsey perched atop impressive cliffs . Set among formal gardens , stables and sports fields , it had a fruitery of lemons and a lily pond full of goldfish . It overlooked a fine beach and a river mouth guarded by towers left from the Napoleonic Wars . The house itself held great chambers of high windows , tooled leather , molded plaster and carved oak . <p> The radar team moved only ten miles , but from one of England 's roughest research stations to its most seductive . Even Watson Watt , quitting his job as head of the Radio Research Station , moved to Bawdsey Manor . There radar 's young men swam in the sea at midday and worked in labs until midnight , or staged evening cricket matches on the manor 's lawn and adjourned to technical debates before a roaring fire in a great timbered hall . They had entered radar heaven . <p> To fill the manor , Watson Watt scoured British universities for brilliant young scientists . They could be ignorant of radio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood radio so little that an amateur radio manual became their main reference book . But soon these amateurs faced professional tests . <p> The Bawdsey spirit found its epitome in an enthusiastic young Welshman , E. G. ( Taffy ) Bowen , who had been working on a doctorate in physics before joining the team and whom Watson Watt liked to portray as a Celtic brigand . Bowen now took responsibility for squeezing radar gear from the size of a room into the size of a two-foot-square box that could be jammed into an airplane . Always smiling and often nearly electrocuting himself , the 24-year-old Bowen set about single-handedly creating the first airborne radar equipment . <p> Late in the summer of 1937 , Bowen , always an eager sportsman , got word of a game he could not resist  --  some military hide-and-seek . A flotilla of ships from the Royal Navy would slip into the North Sea , and then Royal Air Force squadrons would fly off looking for them . Watson Watt urged Bowen , as a civilian brigand , to fly out in his radar-equipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's opening morning , Bowen and two of his Bawdsey team members had their plane aloft at dawn . The weather turned perfect for hiding the navy  --  all cloud and fog . Bowen 's team flew on unconcerned , eyes on their newly created radar screen . At about 8 A.M. , they picked up large echoes five miles away and then cruised over the Royal Navy fleet . The navy , in response , unleashed a barrage of antiaircraft blanks . At the same time , it scrambled all the fighter planes off the deck of the aircraft carrier Courageous  --  whereupon Bowen 's triumphant crew saw , for the first time , that airborne radar could indeed detect approaching planes . <p> They turned away from the onrushing fighters and soon , realizing their plane was flying with little fuel and no visibility , headed for home through the fog . As expected , the coast appeared on their radar screens , and they landed to report success . <p> When Bowen called his report to the Air Ministry , the wing commander in charge confirmed that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed . But , the commander wanted to know , what RAF squadron was taking credit ? Just two civilians and their pilot , Bowen told him . The stunned commander then delivered his own surprise . Because of foul weather , at 8 A.M. the entire exercise had been canceled  --  grounding all RAF aircraft . <p> Bowen 's team , in a stroke , had shown the RAF and the Royal Navy the promise of radar : it could be carried by craft as small as an airplane ; it could detect enemy boats and planes when nothing else could ; it could permit navigation in otherwise-impossible weather . Bowen 's success also showed that Bawdsey was achieving a peculiarly British ideal : the spirited amateur triumphing over hardened professionals ( in this case , military ) . Victory in the future battles of Europe , it seemed , was being prepared on the playing fields not of Eton but of Bawdsey Manor . <p> And then , on September 1 , 1939 , Germany invaded Poland . Britain responded by entering World War 11 . British radar still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for example , if a plane was in front or in back of them . Airborne radar sets , suffering worse problems , had been installed in only six fighters . Most of the flaws could be fixed , but months were needed . <p> Adolf Hitler , to Britain 's surprise , provided those months . Through the end of 1939 and into the summer of 1940 , Germany rolled into Poland and Denmark and Norway and Holland and Belgium and finally France , but did not send any significant force against England . As Europe fell , the RAF lost hundreds of planes in hopeless sacrifice above the fields of France . Winston Churchill , as prime minister , pushed to send more . But Stuffy Dowding managed to hold them back . The man who had bet Britain 's first l0,000 pounds on radar , now the most senior officer in the RAF and the commander in chief of its Fighter Command , Dowding saw that his outnumbered planes had no chance over Europe . But he prayed that radar 's invisible curtain might work well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England . <p> While Dowding prayed for his radar , he must have wondered what the Germans were doing with theirs . They had not , after all , been modest about it . Two years before war began , a German general had announced to RAF officers that the Luftwaffe , too , was working on radar , " and we think we are ahead of you . " To the RAF , that meant Germany had penetrated what Britain once hoped was its private radar secret . With secrecy lost , British radar would be terribly vulnerable . German bombers needed only to hit Britain 's exposed coastal radar stations , it seemed , and the radar curtain would fall in tatters . <p> Britain 's months for unmolested tinkering with radar ended finally in July 1940 . Directed by Field Marshal Hermann Goring , the Luftwaffe began what Winston Churchill called " the Battle of Britain "  --  the fight for Britain 's survival . Goring had 1,500 bombers and 1,000 superb fighters to provide escort , many of them based within 30 miles of Britain . Dowding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense . <p> Goring 's plan was simple . His bombers would lure forth large numbers of RAF defenders . His fighters would gun them down . Once the RAF had been destroyed , Goring 's planes could bomb any Royal Navy ship that entered the no-longer-British Channel . And once that narrow strip of water no longer divided Germany 's army from Britain 's coast , Germany could invade and , said Hitler , " occupy the country completely . " He scheduled the invasion for September 1940 . <p> Meanwhile Dowding kept praying that radar would work well enough  --  and survive long enough  --  to save Britain . Without it , he would need to keep large numbers of fighters patrolling aloft . Without radar his pilots would spend crucial time growing tired and wasting fuel before locating an incoming raid . Without radar his defense would be scattered and weakened . Dowding counted on radar to make all that unnecessary . <p> By the start of the Battle of Britain , a chain of 29 Bawdsey-designed radar stations , sprouting lattices of steel or wood that rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round the British southern and eastern coasts from Land 's End in Cornwall to the Orkney Islands of Scotland . All were linked , or soon would be , by specially laid underground cables to Dowding 's headquarters just north of London . There , also underground , sat a vast map of the English Channel and its adjoining coasts . When Goring 's planes took off from a field in France or Belgium or Holland , wooden markers appeared on the map and were then pushed along the Luftwaffe flight paths by members of the Women 's Auxiliary Air Force , who used plotting rods modeled on croupier 's rakes found in gambling casinos . <p> Using information from the radar map , Dowding 's commanders at RAF bases around the country could send off their fighters not in scattershot swarms but as small flights like rifle shots . As each RAF flight rushed into the air , markers carrying flags appeared on the map and moved to meet the unflagged Luftwaffe markers . Directed by radio calls from ground controllers , RAF fighters raced to intercept the Luftwaffe at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Goring 's bombers and fighters met tight packs of British Spitfires and Hurricanes , flown by fresh pilots with ample fuel and blazing guns . <p> And Goring apparently thought it was luck . Although Germany had entered the war with radar sets as good as Britain 's , it had not bothered to create a system utilizing communication webs and map rooms . Goring knew the coastal towers were intended for radio detection of aircraft , but he could not imagine how the British system worked , if it really worked at all . The radar secret was , so to speak , safe with him . <p> In the first five weeks of the Battle of Britain , the " lucky " RAF outshot the Luftwaffe day after day , losing 128 planes but destroying 255 by August 12 . Finally , pressured by his associates , Goring ordered one concentrated attack on Britain 's radar stations . His bombs hardly damaged the latticed towers  --  only a direct hit would have worked  --  but they severed wires and shattered huts and put five crucial stations out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goring never found out . Dowding and his aides had long been prepared for such a crisis . Within hours , they rushed four stations back into operation and kept the radar curtain nearly intact . The next day , British " luck " continued : the RAF lost 13 fighters , the Luftwaffe 45 . Two days later the RAF lost 34 , the Luftwaffe 75 . As his losses mounted , Goring decided that the radar stations were not just inconsequential , as he had always believed  --  they were indestructible . " Not one of those attacked , " he incorrectly informed his commanders , " has been put out of action . " He ordered German pilots to leave the radar stations alone , except in unusual circumstances . In the next month the Luftwaffe lost plane after plane , and by mid-October Germany had lost all chance of invading Britain . <p> As Fisher points out in " A Race on the Edge of Time , " British radar evolved at the only moment in which it could have saved Britain from invasion . Had it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain . But had it arrived a bit earlier , German strategists might have recognized its importance and destroyed radar 's frail towers . <p> Although the Battle of Britain officially ended in late October 1940 , radar 's role in World War II had only begun . Soon , because of the work of Bowen and many others , radar sets moved into the air . Carried in the noses of planes , they played a crucial role in intercepting German night bombers and in combating German submarines . <p> For all that it contributed to Allied victory , one of the greatest testaments to radar came in defeat  --  at a place called Pearl Harbor . By early December 1941 , the United States had built five radar stations of its own design in Hawaii and had created a central monitoring base near Pearl Harbor . Unfortunately , the base had no effective system : no method to distinguish between hostile and friendly blips , for example , and no communications adequate to direct intercepting planes . Also , it had instructed its five stations to go on duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for no clear reason except perhaps the theory that no enemy would attack after breakfast . Like the German command , it seemed American officers in Hawaii did not take radar seriously . <p> Just before 7 A.M. on December 7 , a few stations reported echoes more than a hundred miles off , and then all but one dutifully shut down . At that lone station , however , one young Signal Corps private had persuaded another private to give him radar lessons . At a few minutes past 7 , their radar screen suddenly flashed the biggest blip they had ever seen , apparently a formation of more than a hundred planes . <p> The privates called the monitoring base to alert the lieutenant on duty . The lieutenant did not know what to do . He told the privates , " Do n't worry about it . " <p> Still the privates kept putting dots on their chart . They traced a massive flight of planes , cruising toward them from 132 miles north of Oahu at 7:02 A.M. to 20 miles at 7:39 A.M. ( when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At about 8 A.M. on December 7 , 1941 , his day 's work complete , the young lieutenant who did not know what to do stepped out of his monitoring base and looked up at Pearl Harbor 's sunny sky . It was full of Japanese bombers . Eight days later , Pearl Harbor had an effective radar system . <p> By Fred Strebeigh <p> <p> The author teaches writing at Yale .
