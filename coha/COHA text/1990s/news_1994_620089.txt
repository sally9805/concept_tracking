<p> From " The Lives of Danielle Steel " by Vickie L. Bane and Lorenzo Benet ( St. Martin 's Press , $ 22.95 ) . <p> Two years to the day after Japan surrendered , bringing an end to World War II , Danielle Fernande Dominique Schuelein-Steel was born in New York City . On August 14 , 1947 , the 7 1/2-pound baby girl made her debut . The only child of John Schuelein-Steel and Norma da Camara Stone des Reis , the newborn Danielle was labeled by family members as " exceptionally pretty . " <p> Baby Danielle was the daughter of immigrants . Like scores of other Germans of Jewish descent , her father 's family had sought passage on crowded ships during the late 1930s and early 1940s to escape the Nazis . Her mother 's family had already arrived in the United States from Lisbon , Portugal , and the Azores Islands , a Portuguese colony in the Atlantic Ocean 740 miles west of Europe . <p> Danielle 's paternal grandparents were born in Munich , Germany , and raised in well-to-do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Brewery Schuelein and Co. in 1895 , later merging it with Lowenbrau in 1921 , creating the largest brewery in Bavaria . <p> DANGER FOR JEWS <p> As Germany came under the dominion of Adolf Hitler , changes were forced on the Schuelein family . By 1933 , Jews were beginning to be excluded from business leadership in Germany , and the executive committee of Lowenbrau sought to remove Steel 's great-uncle Hermann Schuelein , ostensibly to keep him out of the Nazi line of fire . Hermann turned over his title as director , or president , of the company . <p> Later that year , after reading Hitler 's " Mein Kampf " and realizing what the Fuhrer had in mind , Hermann saw the urgency in getting his family out of Germany . By 1936 , the situation in Germany had become so dangerous for Jews that Hermann bought his way out of the country . He was able to get official permission for his family to leave , but at tremendous cost . Jewish emigrants had to leave three- quarters of their fortune , which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source close to the family , was converted at ridiculous rates : 100,000 German marks for $ 8,000 U.S. After buying passage for himself and his family , Hermann had little money left . <p> In 1938 , Josef Schuelein died in Germany and his castle was confiscated by the Nazis . During the next few years , the Schuelein sons fled to the United States , aided in large part by Hermann . <p> GERMAN PLOT <p> Danielle Steel 's 1980 best-seller and first hardcover , " The Ring , " begins in Germany several years before the start of World War II . The book commences with the story of a successful Jewish writer , Dolff Sterne , who can no longer publish his books in Germany . In a moment of anguish , Dolff explains to his lover , the wife of a wealthy German banker , why his homeland will ignore his accomplishments : " A Jew is n't supposed to be successful , is n't supposed to win national awards . There will be no room at all for Jews in the New Germany , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1939 , the World 's Fair came to New York City , and after the fair ended , the Portuguese government wanted to maintain a commercial presence in the United States . To that end , they created Casa de Portugal , the Portuguese national tourist office . Steel 's maternal grandfather , Gil Stone , worked for the organization . <p> Reportedly caught in an unhappy marriage , Stone , then 47 , wanted a divorce from his first wife to marry Tekla Alicanti , a 37-year-old American of Italian descent who was a social worker in New York . Although both he and Tekla were Catholic , Stone was ready to forsake his church and get married by a justice of the peace before his first wife relieved him of that responsibility by dying in early 1945 . In June he traveled to Washington , D.C. , with his only child , Norma , to marry Tekla in St. Thomas Catholic Church . <p> Danielle 's parents , John and Norma , met in New York City as World War II was reaching its peak . They married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Patrick 's Cathedral . John converted from Judaism to Catholicism , said a source close to the family . <p> Some time after Danielle 's birth , the family moved into an apartment on East 45th street off Lexington Avenue in New York City . <p> A bright student , Danielle did especially well in languages . She liked poetry , but her escape was literature . Danielle 's favorite author was Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette , France 's most-honored female writer of her day , who died in August 1954 , just before Danielle 's seventh birthday . <p> Danielle was so " bookish " that she once told a reporter she was kidded in school about " walking into walls " while reading . <p> While intellectual pursuits came easily , athletic endeavors did not . During her school years , she played basketball , volleyball , badminton and golf , but would later joke that her classmates drew lots to see who had to take her on their team . <p> When she was n't at school or studying , Danielle began to take control of her father 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed to Woman 's Day in 1990 , " made his appointments , took care of everything . I thought that was what I was supposed to do . " <p> SICK AND ALONE <p> Unfortunately , their relationship was far from reciprocal in terms of care and concern . <p> Danielle was almost completely deaf in her right ear and was always sickly . She went through a series of hospitalizations for a variety of ailments . She had asthma and allergies , and , at 12 , contracted polio . <p> She would later confide in her second husband that she was often sick and alone in the hospital . And although her bout with polio was relatively mild , it did affect her back , which necessitated three years of intensive physical therapy . Even her vacations were punctuated with illness . At 15 , while on a trip , she got hepatitis from something she ate . <p> ABSENT PARENTS <p> Given Danielle 's own parental role models , it 's no wonder that in nearly two-thirds of her novels the heroine 's parents are somehow persona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the main characters . If family does appear , as in " Thurston House " or " Daddy , " the plot often revolves around the mother abandoning her child ( or children ) and relinquishing control to the father . <p> Danielle 's first love came into her life when she was 14 . Claude- Eric Lazard was eight years her senior , the somber youngest son of an international banking family . They were reportedly introduced by friends . <p> A brown-haired , brown-eyed aristocrat , Claude-Eric was educated in Paris at the Lycee Louis Le Grand . <p> After graduating from Stanford , Claude-Eric enrolled in Columbia University , where he received a master 's in business administration , soon thereafter going to work at Bankers Trust Co. in New York City . <p> By all accounts , Claude-Eric was a " good catch . " <p> His father , Claude Lazard , was the son of a former partner of the international banking firm of Lazard Freres of Paris , and his mother , Esther , was the daughter of Sidney Ehrman , a San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art patron and a philanthropist . Esther 's maternal grandfather was Isais Hellman , who , in the early 1900s , was labeled " the richest man in California . " <p> The Ehrmans were a pillar of California society . They owned a mansion next to the Presidio in San Francisco , and a 1,977-acre estate in Lake Tahoe on Sugar Pine Point , complete with a mile and a half of beachfront on Meek Bay . <p> In 1932 , Claude-Eric 's parents were married by Catholic Archbishop Edward Hanna at the Ehrman mansion in what was termed in newspaper accounts " the most brilliant wedding of the social season . " <p> SIMILAR EPISODES <p> Danielle has included episodes in her World War II-era books such as " Crossings " that were similar to those experienced by Claude and Esther . <p> At 20 , Danielle gave birth to a daughter . Later , although she did n't discuss it publicly , Danielle told a subsequent husband that she felt guilty for not having produced a male heir for Claude-Eric . <p> Four days after the birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-op . From the beginning , a nanny was hired to help care for the baby . In " Having a Baby , " Danielle remembered coming home and suffering from " a little postpartum depression . I mean I was n't in a black funk , but , looking back , I do n't think I was ecstatic either , " she wrote . <p> " For one thing , I really never got to have the baby . I had been through this major experience alone , barely got to hold the baby , never got to share her with my husband , and then I went home and gave her up to a nurse who took over . " <p> Expressing remorse at what she missed , Danielle concluded , " But I was a baby myself and knew nothing about my own baby . And what I lacked most of all was self- confidence . " <p> But Danielle was ripe for new experiences . While on a trip to San Francisco several months later , she was watching " The Tonight Show " when two guests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danielle would later talk about watching Johnny Carson interview two young women who had started a public relations-promotion firm called Supergirls . <p> It was the kind of excitement Danielle craved : two young women marketing their energy and creativity , doing " anything as long as it 's legal . " <p> Intrigued , Danielle called the Supergirls office in New York the next morning to apply for a job . <p> Danielle approached her new duties with unbridled enthusiasm and arrived each morning dressed impeccably . <p> From the book " The Lives of Danielle Steel .
