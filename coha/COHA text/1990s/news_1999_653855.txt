<p> Displayed proudly above the reception desk of the Ilyushin Aviation Complex office at the Paris Air Show here is a newly minted air-worthiness certificate from the United States Federal Aviation Administration . On June 2 , the big , four-engine Russian Ilyushin IL-96T parked nearby became the first wide-body jet , other than ones made by Airbus Industrie and the Boeing Company , to meet F.A.A. safety standards . <p> It was not easy . <p> While Airbus and Boeing have the certification process for new models down to a science , often breezing through it in a year or less , Ilyushin struggled for five years to get approval . And even though it now has the certificate , making it easier for leasing companies and banks to finance sales of the IL-96T , the success of the cargo plane , or of a sister passenger plane that is in the works , is by no means assured . <p> Ilyushin , founded in 1933 by Sergei Vladimirovich Ilyushin , who won the Order of Lenin three times for designing some of Russia 's most famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far . The company , which was partly privatized in 1994 , has orders for 19 more from Aeroflot International Airlines . But it can not even deliver the first one because an agreement for loan guarantees from the Export-Import Bank in Washington that would help pay for the planes has lapsed . <p> But the Ilyushin team , in the best Russian tradition , knows how to live with adversity . " We have overcome so much , " Vladimir A. Belyakov , the company 's deputy marketing director , said , ticking off the collapse of the Soviet Union , the introduction of a market-based economy that eliminated decades of fat government subsidies , and last summer 's financial debacle . " And we continue . " <p> The IL-96T was the inspiration of the late industrialist Armand Hammer , who in 1989 suggested combining the best of the Soviet and American aerospace industries . He convinced wealthy friends , including the publisher Robert Maxwell and the real estate executive Paul Reichmann , to invest in the project . <p> But after Dr. Hammer and Mr. Maxwell died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal fell apart . Mr. Belyakov said Ilyushin executives now joked that they should have taken $1 billion from Mr. Reichmann . " What difference would it have made if he were $11 or $12 billion in debt ? " he asked . <p> But the idea of building a Russian-American airplane survived . Eventually Pratt &; Whitney , a unit of United Technologies , agreed to supply the engines , while Rockwell-Collins , a unit of Rockwell International , furnished the cockpit instruments and controls . Other American suppliers also signed on . The result was the IL-96T . <p> It was  --  and is  --  a bet on the future of the aviation market in Russia , a country that spans 10 time zones and desperately needs more airplanes . Arthur Kelly , the Rockwell-Collins executive who oversaw the company 's role in the project , was a believer , making his final presentation to Rockwell-Collins 's board of directors in the early 1990 's , dressed in the uniform of a Russian Air Force colonel . <p> " Arthur was passionate about getting Rockwell Collins into international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief spokeswoman , said . " He would do things like that . " Mr. Kelly , who died of cancer in 1996 , got the board 's approval . So far , Rockwell-Collins has invested $50 million in the airplane and Pratt &; Whitney $80 million . Mr. Belyakov estimated that Ilyushin had spent $600 million . <p> Sergei Ilyushin joined the young Soviet military as an aircraft mechanic in 1919 and began building gliders as a student at Russia 's Air Force academy in the 1920 's . During World War II , he developed the IL-2 attack airplane to support infantry . <p> For most of its history , Ilyushin was simply a design center , creating airplanes that were built by factories around the Soviet Union as ordered by the central authorities . The system may not have been efficient but it was certainly productive : More than 36,000 of the single-engine prop attack planes were built , making it a mainstay of the war and the most widely produced model in the world . <p> During the cold war , the Ilyushin Design Bureau , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighters but also branched into civil aviation . Hundreds of Ilyushin airplanes were produced each year and " sold " to Soviet allies in the East bloc and elsewhere  --  the allies had little choice but to buy them . <p> The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 ended the cozy relations between the state and the aircraft industry . Government orders dried up . Designers like Ilyushin and the factories that produced its planes were told to make it on their own . While some airplanes , like the mighty Antonov , the world 's largest cargo airplane , have found niche markets , most Russian airplane makers have fallen on hard times . The Antonov , for example , moved the Rockefeller Center 's 73-foot Norway spruce Christmas tree to New York from Cleveland last year . And , because it was being leased , it did not need F.A.A. certification . <p> Liberated East European countries dumped their Russian planes , opting for more modern and cost-efficient Airbus and Boeing jets . Even Aeroflot decided to buy Boeing 737 's and leases Airbus A310 's and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with its factories in Voronezh and Tashkent to form a joint-stock company . ( The Tashkent deal was delayed because the Governments of Russia and the former Soviet republic of Uzbekistan first had to work out a two-way agreement . ) In addition to the new IL-96 , Ilyushin now makes the IL-114 , a regional two-engine prop , the four-engine IL-76 cargo jet , and the IL-103 , a small , single-engine private plane that in December was actually the first Russian airplane to receive F.A.A. certification . <p> So far , business has not been good . A decade ago , 60 IL-76 's were made each year ; last year just 15 were produced . And while China bought three wide-body IL-86 passenger jets and one IL-76 freighter three years ago , most of the new Ilyushins now coming off the assembly line are flown by Russian airlines that lack the money to pay for them . <p> Mr. Belyakov estimated that around 1,500 Ilyushins , ranging from the four-engine prop IL-18 's of the 1950 's to the wide-body , 350-passenger IL-86 's of the 1970 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , Cuba , India and Vietnam . <p> The new , Westernized version of the IL-96 is based on the all-Russian IL-96-300 , which went into service in 1993 . It is currently flown only by Russian airlines and serves as the official plane of President Boris N. Yeltsin . The IL-96M , which is the soon-to-be-introduced passenger version of the new airplane , can carry up to 436 passengers . <p> The company says the IL-96T , which is the cargo version and the first of the planes to come off the assembly line , can carry as much as 92 tons more than 7,000 miles . <p> That makes it smaller than the biggest Boeing 747 freighter , which can carry up to 140 tons . But Genrikh V. Novozhilov , Ilyushin 's chief airplane designer since 1970 , said the IL-96T 's 16-foot-wide and **25;424;TOOLONG side cargo door , which is bigger than any competitor 's , gave it a competitive edge . And at an asking price of $75 million , the plane is less than half the list price of a new 747 , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel-efficient American engines . Thus , its backers contend , the IL-96T could find a ready market , even a huge one , from cash-short customers that need cheap hauling capacity . <p> That may be one reason why Boeing unsuccessfully lobbied the Clinton Administration in 1995 not to let the Export-Import Bank guarantee a $1 billion loan to pay for 85 percent of the Western content of the first 20 planes . Boeing said that it did not mind competing with Ilyushin but not when Russian Government subsidies enabled it to sell its planes at below market prices . <p> " It 's not a bad airplane , " said Edwin Laird , the publisher of Cargo Facts , a monthly magazine that focuses on freight airplanes , as he watched the IL-96T lumber along the runway into take-off position for its demonstration flight here . But that is a just a small part of the equation , he explained . <p> " The airlines are not worried about the engines or the avionics , which are all made in America , " he said . " They are worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaks down ? Do you go out in the back yard and make a part ? " He said he doubted there would be much of a market for the plane outside Russia until it had proved itself . <p> Mr. Belyakov said Ilyushin was prepared to offer airlines a global support network with the help of Pratt &; Whitney and others . The real problem , he said , is that Ilyushin lacks the money to help customers finance the purchase of its planes . <p> The F.A.A. certification will help with that . Uncertified planes like the IL-96-300 are allowed to fly back and forth between the United States and Russia but it is very difficult to sell airplanes in third countries without a stamp of approval from American or European safety authorities . Few banks and other financial institutions will lend money to finance the sale of an uncertified airplane . <p> Mr. Belyakov said that Ilyushin was now looking for alternative ways to finance the Aeroflot sale to make up for the absence of the Export-Import Bank loan guarantees . Ilyushin 's plan is to deliver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so it can show the world how well the IL-96 can perform in commercial service . But Ilyushin executives were busy entertaining prospective customers at the air show here and were said to have some interest from airlines in Europe and Asia . <p> " There is a lot of opportunity for it in the C.I.S. , " said Louis Chenevert , the president of Pratt &; Whitney , referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States , the successor to the Soviet Union . " But as the airplane builds credibility for itself , it will gain customers all over the world . The airplane will do well over the next couple of years . " <p> Not that Airbus and Boeing should really lose any sleep . Together , they will deliver more than 900 new airplanes this year , while Ilyushin will be lucky to deliver one of its IL-96 's . <p> " The F.A.A. certification will ease access to international capital for us and for our customers , " Mr. Belyakov said . " We are rising to the same level of competitiveness with the Western-made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A New Bird in the Sky " The Russian Ilyushin 96T cargo plane was recently deemed safe by the F.A.A. , and a passenger version is planned .
