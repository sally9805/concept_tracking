<p> When 5-year-old Max McCaffrey plays soccer , his 3-year-old brother , Christian , ca n't bear to watch . <p> ' Christian is always trying to run out on the field to be with his big brother , ' his dad said . ' We have to keep reeling him back in . ' <p> Christian ca n't help it . The need for speed , the energy driving his little motor , the desire to follow the bouncing ball - they 're in his genes . <p> His grandfather won a silver medal in the 100-meter dash in the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome . Uncle Billy became a legend in the Pennsylvania rust belt and later won a national basketball championship with the Duke Blue Devils . <p> When she was a pixie in South Florida , Christian 's mom scored so many goals for her high school soccer team that her mug shot ended up in Sports Illustrated 's ' Faces in the Crowd . ' <p> Christian 's dad ? All he 's done is win three Super Bowl rings , earn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stop a rhinoceros , become one of the best receivers in Denver Broncos history and destroy forever the notion that white men ca n't run . <p> The fusion of these two highly charged athletic families began at Stanford University in Palo Alto , Calif . That 's where a 5-foot-6 , 125-pound soccer player with an acerbic wit named Lisa Sime met a 6-5 , 230-pound wide receiver with an All-American persona and a bad haircut . <p> ' We met at a birthday party of a mutual friend , ' Ed McCaffrey recalled . ' For me , it was love at first sight . ' <p> Wait . Not so fast , bucko . <p> ' Um , we have a little discrepancy there , ' Lisa McCaffrey said . ' I think we met in preseason in the trainer 's room . I was in there getting taped . If he does n't remember , it 's because he was this big-time football player , and I was just this little soccer player . ' <p> It really does n't matter . One way or another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love and started a family . Last March 25 , Lisa gave birth to son No. 3 . His name is Dylan . <p> ' He 'll probably love sports , too , but it 's a little too early to tell , ' Lisa said . <p> Olympic roots <p> To find the roots of this incredible athletic family tree , you have to go back to Fair Lawn High School in northern New Jersey in the 1950s . That 's where Lisa 's dad , David Sime , began his athletic legacy . He was a star in basketball , baseball and football . He always knew he could run fast , but it was n't until he went to Duke that he realized he was a world-class sprinter . <p> ' I never even ran track until I got to Duke , ' recalled Sime , now an eye surgeon in Miami . <p> Sime was a star center fielder for the Blue Devils in 1957 , hitting .379 and earning All-American honors . <p> But it was his fleet feet that landed him on the cover of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cover with the legendary Bobby Morrow . Sime had beaten Morrow in the Drake Relays , and the two were being touted as the world 's fastest men before the U.S. Olympic Trials . <p> Morrow went on to win three gold medals at the 1956 Summer Games in Melbourne , but Sime tore his groin muscle during the Olympic Trials and had to wait until ' 60 to get his shot in Rome . <p> That 's where he met a brash young boxer named Cassius Clay , who later changed his name to Muhammad Ali . <p> ' I was the only white sprinter on our team , so I used to have breakfast every morning with all of the black athletes , ' Sime recalled . ' Muhammad - he was Cassius back then - was wonderful . He was a terrific , clean-living kid . He was just starting his bravado act back then . <p> ' I remember one day , Floyd Patterson , who was the heavyweight champion of the world at the time , came into the Olympic village with his entourage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fork and begins screaming , ' Patterson , I 'm going to have you for dinner ! " <p> Ali went on to win the gold medal . Sime took home the silver . He ran the 100 meters in 10.2 seconds but lost in a photo finish to Germany 's Armin Hary . <p> ' It was actually a very disappointing time for me , ' Sime recalled . ' I anchored the 4-by-100-meter relay and we won , but then we were disqualified for a foul . ' <p> Lisa McCaffrey did n't know about her father 's silver medal , or about the fact that at one time or another between 1956-66 he owned world records in six sprint events . <p> ' I did n't know about the Olympics and all of that until my fifth-grade gym teacher told me , ' she said . <p> What she did know was that her father was the kind of man who went helicopter skiing in British Columbia , ran and biked like a madman and played tennis with passion . <p> ' My dad 's like a thoroughbred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so intense . He has to work out . If he does n't , he 's like a race horse that ca n't run . He 's got all this pent-up energy . ' <p> Living here in Allentown <p> So did the McCaffrey kids . <p> They grew up in the industrial town of Allentown , Pa. , the sons and daughters of the Catholic family headed by Ed Sr. and his wife , Elizabeth . <p> Ed Sr. and his wife did n't play a lot of sports themselves , although he did play one year of basketball at St. Joseph 's College in Philadelphia . <p> ' I guess we were too busy putting ourselves through college , ' he said . <p> It was that kind of blue-collar work ethic - that steel rod of structure - that mattered in the industrial northeast . Just ask Billy Joel . <p> Education mattered , too . That 's why the McCaffreys sent their children to Allentown 's Central Catholic High School . It 's a school so proud of its tradition , that callers are greeted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' three-time Blue Ribbon School of Excellence . One of only 36 nationwide . ' <p> ' We all loved sports , but we considered athletics a privilege , ' Ed Sr. said . ' We expected our kids to take care of academics first . Then they could play sports . ' <p> Ed Jr . remains thankful for that . <p> ' I think it 's obvious what a school like that gives you , ' he said . ' It was a place about morals and values . It was a place where we got support . ' <p> According to Dennis Ramella , the athletic director at Allentown 's Central Catholic High School for the last 24 years , the McCaffrey name was pure gold in steel country . <p> ' If you mention the name McCaffrey in the Lehigh Valley , everyone knows who you are talking about , ' Ramella said . ' Even now , the McCaffreys are still the first family of sport in the Lehigh Valley . ' <p> But it was about more than just sports . <p> ' The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They had great intellect , were outstanding students and model citizens . They must have been taught those things from a very young age . <p> ' Those McCaffrey kids were given a gift to be great athletes , but it was their parents who taught them that responsibility came along with the gift . ' <p> All the right moves <p> Eddie McCaffrey , as he was known back then , was the first football player in Central Catholic history to be named a Parade All-American . <p> But it was in Central Catholic 's musty old , 3,200-seat Knute Rockne Hall , with its metal bleachers and capacity crowds , where the McCaffrey siblings wowed them on the basketball floor . <p> First came Eddie . Already 6-5 by the time he was in high school , he was , as Ramella recalled , ' a man among boys . ' <p> ' I was his assistant coach back then , ' Ramella said . ' Ed was this physically overpowering player . We had an inbounds play where we signaled No. 1 . But actually , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball into Eddie and he jammed it home . ' <p> Eddie averaged 21.4 points his senior season and finished his career with a then-school record 1,637 points . Eddie 's Vikings won a state title in 1984 and again in ' 86 . <p> Next in line was sister Monica , who was one year behind Eddie . Her Vikings won a state title in 1987 , her senior season . She finished her career with a school-record 1,903 points . It 's a record that stood until point guard Michelle Marciniak , who later starred for Pat Summitt at the University of Tennessee , obliterated it by scoring 3,025 career points . <p> ' Monica was a lot like Eddie , ' Ramella said . ' She was 5-11 and she was a dominant player . She was a force inside . ' <p> Monica , who went on to start for two seasons at Georgetown University , still holds Central Catholic 's record for rebounds in a season ( 394 ) and points in a game ( 50 ) . <p> And then there was ' Billy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high school basketball player I ever saw , ' said big brother Ed . <p> Billy certainly was the best hoopster to come out of the Lehigh Valley . <p> Billy was a talented freshman when Eddie won his second state championship , in 1986 . And the truth of the matter is , without his kid brother , Eddie never would have gotten that second title . <p> Central Catholic had breezed through the regular season , winning the league and district titles . But in the first round of the state playoffs , the Vikings ran into a stubborn Warwick High School team . <p> ' We kind of figured it would be an automatic game , ' Ramella said . ' We went through all of our guards , and they just were n't doing anything . ' <p> That 's when Vikings coach Bob Schlosser looked down the bench and eyed the eager freshman . <p> ' Do we have the guts to do what we know we have to do ? ' Schlosser asked his assistants . <p> And so in went Billy . In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baskets . The Vikings came back to beat Warwick , and then cruised through the rest of the playoffs to the state title . <p> ' Billy did n't play a lot the rest of the way , but he saved his big brother 's season , ' Ramella said . ' They got a state championship together . That game against Warwick , that little stretch , that 's when everybody started calling him ' Billy The Kid . " <p> Billy never won another state title , despite his 37-point performance in the state championship game his senior season . But he broke his older brother 's career scoring record and averaged 27.9 points as a senior . <p> Next month , after the traditional 10-year waiting period , Billy will join Eddie and take his place on the Rockne Wall of Fame at Central Catholic . <p> ' The McCaffrey 's legend was immense here , ' Ramella said . ' People still talk about them . If you say ' Billy ' or ' Eddie , ' everyone knows who you mean when it comes to sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Billy , the 1988-89 Pennsylvania player of the year , went on to be a collegiate star . After playing in the McDonald 's Classic with players such as Bobby Hurley and Shaquille O'Neal , he ended up at Duke . He started 21 games on the Blue Devils ' 1990-91 national championship team , averaging 11.6 points . He was selected to the all-Final Four squad after scoring 16 points off the bench in the title game against Kansas . <p> Billy then transferred to Vanderbilt , where he became a star for the Commodores . In 1993-94 , he was named Southeastern Conference co-player of the year along with Kentucky 's Jamal Mashburn . <p> Billy is trying out for a number of teams in the Continental Basketball Association after spending four years overseas playing ball in Italy , Australia and Germany . <p> Family ties <p> The athletic endeavors of Ed and Lisa McCaffrey 's other siblings are notable , too . For example , Scott Sime , Lisa 's big brother , was a state wrestling champion and all-state football player at Florida 's Coral Gables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullback at Duke . He carries remnants from that career to this day . <p> ' He got hit by ( Virginia Tech 's ) Bruce Smith so hard in one game that he started having migraine headaches , ' Lisa said . ' He never had them before that hit , but he still has them today . ' <p> And what about Lisa herself ? <p> ' She 's a great athlete , ' her husband Ed said . ' I know she kicks my butt in tennis . ' <p> In the spring of 1997 , less than a year after giving birth to Christian , Lisa finished fifth in her age group in Denver 's Cherry Creek Sneak 5-mile run . <p> Back in Florida at her tiny private school of Ransom Everglades High School , Lisa once set the school record in the 100-meter dash and lettered in tennis four times . She scored 56 goals in her career , and it was her proficiency for putting the soccer ball in the net that landed her mug shot in Sports Illustrated in 1986 . <p> ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said the self-deprecating mother of three . ' So it 's not like I was scoring goals against these great players . I mean , our school gave out letters for water polo . ' <p> Still , Lisa was a good enough soccer player that Vanderbilt offered her its first women 's soccer scholarship . She turned it down , opting for the Stanford experience instead . <p> Although Stanford did n't offer soccer scholarships at the time , Lisa played , and started , for the Cardinal for three years until she ruptured two discs in her back . <p> ' Sports taught me a lot , ' she said . ' I remember we used to have three-a-day practices during the summer , getting ready for the season . It makes you realize that you can handle it . It makes you realize that you can handle just about anything I think it helped me get through childbirth . Seriously . And I know it got me through those 2 a.m. feedings with the kids . ' <p> And the early lessons at Central Catholic obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was cut by the then-New York Giants head coach Dan Reeves in the summer of 1994 . It was his talent and his drive to succeed that have turned him into one of the best wide receivers in the NFL . <p> Generation Next ? <p> So , what about the McCaffrey kids ? Will Max , Christian and Dylan be Colorado 's sports stars of the future ? Like the Kennedys in the realm of politics , will the McCaffreys breed a new generation of athletes ? <p> ' I think it 's inevitable that they will play sports , ' said Lisa , who coached Max 's soccer team this fall . ' Who knows if they are going to be talented or not ? But I want them to be involved in what they love . If that 's books or music , that 's a good thing , too . ' <p> But will the next generation of McCaffreys live high on the hog , feeding off their dad 's success as a football player , mustard salesman and McDonald 's pitchman ? <p> That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 'd like to pass that on to his sons . But he wo n't push them where they do n't want to go . <p> ' I 'll give them direction , but I wo n't put pressure on them , ' he said . ' I think sports is good for goal setting , and I think it teaches you some important values . So far , Max and Christian seem to love sports . But we 'll just have to see . What Lisa and I want is for our kids to grow up to be good people . ' <p> But maybe , just maybe , the legacy that began with a silver medal , matured in that musty old gym in Allentown and came of age in Denver Broncos uniform No. 87 , will someday be bestowed upon one of the little McCaffreys . <p> Should they be so blessed . <p> THE MCCAFFREY FAMILY TREE <p> ED McCAFFREY 'S SIDE OF THE FAMILY <p> EDWARD McCAFFERY SR . &; ELIZABETH McCAFFREY <p> EDWARD McCAFFREY <p> - Played one year of basketball at St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ELIZABETH McCAFFREY <p> Their children : <p> EDWARD MCCAFFREY Jr . <p> - Pro Bowl wide receiver with Denver Broncos .
