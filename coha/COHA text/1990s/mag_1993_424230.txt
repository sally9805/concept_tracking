THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE WORKS TO REINTRODUCE BIGHORN TO THEIR HISTORIC RANGE . <p> THWHOCK ! A sound like a rifle shot echoes off the surrounding cliffs , rippling outward over the sandstone fantasy of Canyonlands National Park . Then , a second and a third distinctive crack follow , splitting the autumn air . <p> Two rams materialize on the ridge line overhead , their horns spiraling to nearly full curl . They pivot to opposing stances , stand upright , and walk forward , falling into a headlong lunge . <p> The larger ram powers from a higher stance . His horn plate explodes off the young ram 's right curl and blows the challenger backward over a 15-foot cliff . Twisting and writhing , the sheep tumbles upside down and disappears among the ragged boulders . A puff of duse hangs in the air where the two rams met . <p> Although it seems impossible for the loser to have survived the fall , he scrambles up trembling , eyes wild , and nostrils flared in alarm , outwardly intact . The triumphant ram poses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ewes . From across the basin comes another , more muffled crack . It is late autumn in Canyonlands , and the desert bighorn rut has started . <p> Images of dueling bighorn strike romantic chords within us all , but shepherding these symbols of the wild toward the 21st century has been a bittersweet effort . Although there are some bright spots , the bighorn 's future seems as rocky as the terrain the animals have come to prefer . The challenge for wildlife management agencies , such as the National Park Service , is coming up with the winning formula for sustaining the species . <p> Desert bighorn do not respond well to the types of techniques used to build the dwindling numbers of many big game species , and intensive efforts , such as reintroducing the animals in certain areas , have merely slowed the decline . Historically , bands of fewer than 50 individuals do not survive more than 50 years , and herds made up of 50 to 90 bighorn typically do not last beyond 70 years . Only populations of more than 100 sheep have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well below that number . <p> At Zion National Park in Utah , bighorn were introduced to replace a native herd that had disappeared decades earlier . But this herd , introduced 20 years ago , was nearly destroyed by a combination of cougar predation and an exotic cattle disease  --  a grotesque sinusitis caused by larvae from the botfly , a parasitic nostril fly . <p> " We wrote the herd off in the mid- ' 80s , " says state biologist Jim Guymon , who has followed the Zion herd since its introduction . " Then , in 1990 the park began receiving reports of sheep sightings , which led to a helicopter overflight last year . " Park officials were elated to count a herd of nearly 40 desert sheep , about half of them lambs , although Zion 's herd is far from stable . <p> In an effort to duplicate the results at Zion National Park in a more predictable manner , the Park Service recently began its bighorn initiative . The steps involve taking a census to find out how many bighorn sheep there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which techniques succeeded and which did not ; performing genetic and mortality studies to establish herd health ; doing habitat inventories to determine the best areas for future reintroductions ; and eventually restoring wild sheep to historic park habitats . Among the buttes of Canyonlands , biologists working from a helicopter surveyed the Island in the Sky herd this fall . From there , they moved to the Needles herd , and then farther north along the Colorado  --  Utah border to Dinosaur National Monument . <p> " We 've got lots of small , isolated populations , which typically do n't survive long , " said Frank Singer , the Park Service research ecologist charged with coordinating the intermountain region 's bighorn initiative . " And a lot of our transplanted herds have n't done too well , so we 're looking into how we can improve that . Mesa Verde National Monument in Colorado , for example , is down to three or four animals . Our number one priority for the bighorn initiative is interagency cooperation . With three or four exceptions , you ca n't manage sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Despite problems with poaching , loss of habitat , and diminishing water supplies , the biggest immediate problem facing desert bighorn is livestock diseases for which they have little resistance . These diseases have ravaged bighorn herds throughout their historic range , an area that once supported huge numbers . <p> The animal 's curling horns are the single most prevalent figure in desert rock art , and turn-of-the-century naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton estimated nearly two million desert sheep roamed North America when the conquistador Coronado first penetrated their habitat in 1540 . Successive mineral strikes occurred throughout desert bighorn country from 1849 to 1940 , bringing with them displacement , loss of water supplies , subsistence hunting , and diseases . <p> Although historically desert bighorn used foothill and valley habitat , over time they became a reclusive mountain species . By 1979 , biologists estimated only 11,000 to 14,500 desert sheep remained in six Southwestern states . Now , because pressures on the sheep have diminished and management has increased , the population has climbed to 20,000 , although no one knows their true numbers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to observe . Most live scattered among the mountain ranges of the Southwest deserts in small bands , and most are reintroduced . Many of the sheep used for reintroduction come from herds with higher numbers and healthy populations living on lands administered by either a state agency or the Bureau of Land Management ( BLM ) . <p> Bighorn reproduction rates are lower than those of most wild ungulates , and their life spans are about ten years . The rutting season is late autumn , and the lambs , which weigh about eight pounds , are born in the most rugged terrain six months after breeding , typically April and May . The average adult bighorn ram weighs 160 to 200 pounds , and ewes , about 105 , although the animals ' weight can vary 30 percent from summer to winter . <p> Bighorn range within a radius of about ten to 20 miles and during their travels can come into contact with domestic livestock . Rams ' horns provide an unfortunate target for diseases . To limit the weight of rams ' horns , which can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous hollow sinus cavities honeycombing their skull and horn cores . These sinuses can also form a reservoir for infection , and consequently desert bighorn are susceptible to a variety of sinusitises . <p> The constant transport of livestock throughout the West has spread disease so efficiently that most wild sheep now carry live organisms , not just the antibodies , for a number of ailments : pasteurella , moraxella , bluetongue , bovine sinusoidal respiratory virus , and epizootic hemorrhagic disease . Some of these can be transmitted by flies or gnats , but the original source is domestic livestock . Pasteurella and moraxella , bacterial pneumonias common to domestic sheep , require contact , and stress or poor nutrition may cause these diseases to express themselves . <p> Sheep seek social contact wherever they can find it , readily mingling with domestic herds , often nuzzling nose-to-nose . Die-offs usually start within ten days after contact with a domestic herd , and bighorn mortality rates of 95 percent are common during the first wave of disease . Surviving adults generally do not show active symptoms , but all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Disease has taken its toll throughout bighorn range . The North and South San Juan herds , which ranged from the Needles District of Canyonlands south to the San Juan River  --  once the state 's largest herd  --  are gone , virtually exterminated by pasteurella and moraxella . The implications for Rocky Mountain bighorn have been especially pronounced ; they remain extinct in huge areas of historic habitat throughout Colorado , Wyoming , Montana , Idaho , Oregon , Washington , and northern Utah where domestic sheep were heavily grazed . <p> Two subspecies , the California and peninsular bighorns , are listed by the state of California as threatened . The U.S. population of peninsular bighorn was federally listed as a threatened species late last year . Native sheep disappeared from Big Bend in Texas , Colorado National Monument , Arches and Capitol Reef national parks , and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area in Utah . Grand Canyon , Dinosaur National Monument in Utah , Death Valley in California , and Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument in southern Arizona all harbor remnant native populations , which are especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Juan herd in the early 1980s regularly turned up 300 desert bighorn . In 1982 , shortly after a wild ram was seen mixing with domestic sheep on a BLM grazing allotment near Hatch Point , wild sheep began dying . By 1989 , overflights of the North San Juan herd revealed only eight desert bighorn , none of them lambs . Since then , the South San Juan herd and the Needles District Canyonlands herd have followed similar downward spirals . There are no geographical barriers separating sick herds from healthy ones , and bighorn rams are occasionally seen crossing the Green and Colorado Rivers . <p> Overall , the population of the Colorado corridor herds has climbed , but the potential for a crash similar to the one that obliterated the North San Juan herd is a constant threat . Die-offs related to domestic sheep raged through Death Valley National Monument in 1960 and Lava Beds National Monument in 1980 . There is significant danger for any herd when nearby grazing allotments are too close or when vacant allotments are reactivated . Trespass grazing , both intentional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southwest parks . Most Bureau of Land Management or U.S. Forest Service sheep allotments bordering bighorn herds have been closed . <p> Eighty percent of desert bighorn habitat is administered by the Bureau of Land Management , mostly in southern California , southern Nevada , Arizona , and southern Utah . Some of this land is proposed-as part of the 1.5-million-acre Mojave National Monument in the California Desert Protection Act . Wildlife refuges , military reservations , Park Service lands , and larger state parks like California 's Anza-Borrego account for much of the remainder of the animal 's habitat . Although most of the habitat is administered by BLM , much of the land in the Death Valley region of California and along the Colorado River corridor from Canyon-lands south through Glen and Grand canyons to Lake Mead is administered by the Park Service . <p> In some ranges , particularly where mule deer have expanded , cougar predation can be a serious limiting factor . In Nevada 's BLM country , 66 percent of all radio-collared bighorn died from lion predation over the course of a decade . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historic habitats , this can be a temporary but troublesome obstacle . <p> Coming up with money for programs such as the bighorn initiative is not easy . At the same time that Congress appropriated $4.5 million to expand the new visitor center in the Needles District of Canyonlands , biologists with BLM NPS , and the state were forced to pool their funds like kids buying a skateboard magazine to get $7,400 to pay for the helicopter time needed to count sheep in Potash and Canyonlands . This example further illustrates a shortcoming of the Park Service , which was the focus of a recent report by the Interior Department 's inspector general . The report criticized the Park Service for spending too much money on visitor accommodations while ignoring the resources . But in fairness to the Park Service , although the agency may seek money to pay for research , these programs are not always approved by Congress . <p> Although NPS may have trouble getting funds for bighorn research , some private groups have made the sheep a priority . The Friends of North American Wild Sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the San Juan/Needles epidemic , including blood tests on Island , Potash , and Lockhart Basin sheep to see if the problem is spreading . <p> Restricted funding is a problem throughout desert bighorn management . In Grand Canyon no one has any idea how many sheep lie tucked among the terraces of the 300-mile canyon . " We 've had no funding for any sheep work for some time , " says Grand Canyon biologist Johnny Ray . " We 've requested it , but nothing has come through . When it comes to sheep , even our field technicians have been laid off . " Their limited funds are taken by species listed as threatened or endangered , such as the bald eagle , Mexican spotted owl , southern willow flycatcher , and humpback chub , an endangered Colorado River fish . <p> Although the situation sounds dismal , the picture is more hopeful than it at first seems , and evidence suggests that the decline of the desert bighorn has been halted . In the sizable refuge of Canyonlands National Park , the Island in the Sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contiguous population ) are doing well . The BLM Potash herd to the north , the Lockhart Basin transplants to the east , and the Canyonlands Maze District herd transplanted west of the Green River are all thriving . Colorado , New Mexico , and Texas each have populations of about 300 . Twenty-five sheep introduced into Arches National Park in the mid-1980s have grown to more than 50 . Perhaps 800 desert bighorn populate the Colorado River herds . To the north , herds introduced to the San Rafael Swell , a BLM area recommended for park designation by NPCA , now total more than 300 sheep . The huge bombing ranges and military reservations of California 's Mojave Desert also include large expanses of bighorn habitat where visitation , grazing , and development are negligible , and water sources can be improved for sheep . All of these lands combine with Park Service , state , and BLM lands to form a huge habitat net work . The biggest limiting factor to bighorn expansion , in California as throughout much of their range , is lack of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denude range and compete for critical water holes . <p> In the cactus and alkali hardpan of southern California , more than 3,900 Nelson 's , another subspecies , and 600 peninsular bighorn inhabit the Sonoran and Mojave zones by incorporating jojoba and barrel cactus into their diet . In Joshua Tree National Monument , the surveys have identified one tenuous population in the Cockscomb Mountains . Bighorn south of Joshua Tree are considered peninsular sheep . <p> Native sheep are beginning their long climb back to a secure niche in North America 's deserts . Unlike the large carnivores , desert bighorn are fairly undemanding in their habitat requirements . They need adequate forage , accessible escape terrain , reliable water supplies , and a reasonable level of solitude . <p> Throughout the Southwest , nearly two-thirds of appropriate bighorn habitat is vacant . " Glen Canyon National Recreation Area looks to be one of our most promising areas for expansion , " says the bighorn initiative 's Singer .
