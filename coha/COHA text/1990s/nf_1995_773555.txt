txt // of grief and loss in that moment . Only those who " have been there " will fully comprehend such an experience . The funeral was held three days later , at which time I delivered a tribute to my father . Somehow I managed to express the following words from my heart on that cold December day . The Tribute To our friends and loved ones , I want to express appreciation on behalf of our family for each of you being here today . We appreciate your coming to honor the man whom we loved so dearly ? the man whose name I share . I asked my mother for this privilege of paying tribute to my dad , although quite honestly , this is the most difficult moment of my life . This man whose body lies before me was not only my father and my friend , but he was also the source of great inspiration for me . Few people realize that most of my writings are actually an expression of his views and his teachings . Whenever we were together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the kind of relationship we had , and his loss is devastating to me . So I do n't apologize for the grief that overwhelms me in this hour . These are not tears of guilt or remorse or regret . I have no bitter memories . . . there were no harsh words that I wish I could retrieve ... we had no conflicts or struggles or strife . The emotion that you see reflects only the love of a soil who has suddenly lost his father and gentle friend . Some of you are aware that my dad had a very serious heart attack in September of this year . Shirley and I had traveled to San Antonio , Texas , where I was to speak to the Texas Pediatric Society on Friday . When we arrived at the hotel on Thursday night , we received a message from Dr. PauI Cunningham , indicating that my dad was in intensive care i n a Kansas City hospital . On Friday morning , Dr. Cunningha n i called again to say that my father 's condition had worsened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . He also informed me that my uncle , Dr. James McGraw , had died in the same hospital at 10:30 that morning . It is impossible to describe the sorrow that Shirley and I felt as we flew to Kansas City that afternoon . We never expected to see my dad alive again and went through all the agonies of his loss . But when we arrived at the airport , we learned that my dad had made a remarkable improvement and was anticipating our visit at the hospital . How thankful I will always be that God answered our prayers and granted us seventy-nine more days ? beautiful , golden days ? before He took my dad to heaven on December 4 , 1977 . May I share with you what thoughts went through my troubled mind on that endless plane trip from San Antonio to Kansas City ? I journeyed backward in time , experiencing a kaleidoscope of early memories . I thought about the very happiest days of my life , occurring when I was between ten and thirteen years of age . My dad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a wintry morning . We would put on our hunting clothes and heavy boots , and drive twenty miles from the little town where we lived . After parking the car and climbing over a fence , we entered a wooded area which I called the " big woods " because the trees seemed so large to me . We would slip down to the creek bed and follow that winding stream several miles back into the forest . Then my dad would hide me under a fallen tree which made a little room with its branches . He would find a similar shelter for himself around a bend in the creek . Then we would await the arrival of the sun and the awakening of the animal world . Little squirrels and birds and chipmunks would scurry hack and forth , not knowing they were being observed . My dad and I then watched as the breathtaking panorama of the morning unfolded , which spoke so eloquently of the God who made all things . But most importantly , there was something dramatic that occurred out there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and affection was generated on those mornings // that set the tone for a lifetime of fellowship . There was a closeness and a oneness that made me want to be like that man .. . that made me choose his values as my values , his dreams as my dreams , his God as my God . These were among the memories that surged through my mind on that lonely plane trip in September . Then another flood of emotion came over me , as I thought about my own children . I wondered what memories will predominate in their minds when I lie at the point of death , a moment or two from now . What will they remember to be the happiest experiences of their lives ? Will they recall a busy father who was preoccupied with writing books and catching planes and answering mail and talking on the telephone and being a " big man " ? Or will they recall a patient dad who took time to love them and teach them and enjoy the beauty of God 's world with them ? I pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of my list of priorities during the precious primetime years . James Dobson was a man of many intense loves . His greatest passion was expressed in his love for Jesus Christ . His every thought and deed were motivated or influenced by his desire to serve his Lord . And I can truthfully say that we were never together without my being drawn closer to God by being in his presence . Not because he warned me or chastised me . . . but because his love for the Lord penetrated and shaped my own attitudes . The last conversation I ever held with my dad reflected my confidence in his faith . Exactly five days before his death , I telephoned him from Los Angeles at 11:27 A.M. I said , " Dad , I have an appointment at 11:30 and can only talk for three minutes . I am calling because I face some decisions this afternoon which are very important to me professionally , and I want you to pray for me . " His final word were , " I will pray about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did ! My dad also loved my mother with great intensity . The fact was beautifully illustrated last year when my parent , ' came to visit us in California . Dad and I took a walk in , 1 // nearby park one morning , and as usual , he was talking and I was writing . He then reached into his pocket and retrieved a crumpled sheet of paper which looked very old . He said , " You might be interested in reading this statement . These are words I expressed to your mother before we were married , forty-two years ago . They were not read to her , but I later wrote down the thoughts I had communicated . " This message was written on the paper . I want you to understand and be fully aware of my feelings concerning the marriage covenant which we are about to enter . I have been taught at my mother 's knee , and in harmony with the Word of God , that the marriage vows are inviolable , and by entering into them , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estrangement from you through divorce for any reason at all ( although God allows one ? infidelity ) will never at any time be permitted to enter into my thinking . I 'm not naive in this . On the contrary , I 'm fully aware of the possibility , unlikely as it now appears , that mutual incompatibility or other unforeseen circumstances , could result in extreme mental suffering . If such becomes the case , I am resolved for my part to accept it as a consequence of the commitment I am now making , and to bear it , if necessary , to the end of our lives together . I have loved you dearly as a sweetheart and will continue to love you as my wife . But over and above that , I love you with a Christian love that demands that I never react in any way toward you that would jeopardize our prospects of entering heaven , which is the supreme objective of both our lives . And I pray that God Himself will make our affection for one another perfect and eternal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love you " ? How badly America needs husbands and fathers who are committed to their families ? men who are determined to succeed in this important responsibility . My father was such a man , and his // devotion to my mother grew steadily through their forty-three years of marriage . They were mutually dependent in the way God intended . It is fitting , therefore , that in his final moment of consciousness , he fell toward my mother and died peacefully in her arms . Very few people fully comprehended the depth of my dad 's love of learning . When he died , he left a book beside his big chair , opened to a description of the molecular structure of deoxyribonucleic acid and the process by which hereditary characteristics are transmitted from one generation to the next . Beside it was a list ( in his handwriting ) of the twenty essential amino acids in humans , and how they are genetically coded . ( He called them " God 's four-letter words .

He left a half-finished painting of . a mountain stream in his basement , with a photograph propped to its right . A palette of oils still rests where he placed them on that final Saturday night . Yes , my dad loved everything God made , and it is thrilling to contemplate the learning process that must be occurring right now on the other side ! Finally , my dad also loved me . I 've known that from my earliest moments of awareness . I 'm told that when I was a small child , perhaps three years of age , we lived in a one-bedroom apartment . My little bed was located beside the bed of my parents . Dad said it was not uncommon during that time for him to awaken at night and hear a little voice whispering , " Daddy ? Daddy ? " He would answer quietly , " What , Jimmy ? " Then I would reply , " Hold my hand ! " My dad would reach across the darkness and grope for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said the instant he encompassed my hand , my arm would become limp and my breathing deep and regular . I had gone back to sleep . You see , I only wanted to know that he was there ! I have been reaching for him throughout my forty-one years , and he has always been there . And now for the first time in my life , he 's gone . // So where do we go from here ? Do we leave this church today in despair and discouragement ? Certainly not , although our sorrow is incalculable . But my dad is not in that casket before us . He is alive , and we will soon see him again . He has achieved the pearl of eternal life , which is our heritage , too . I now understand that the death of my dad was not an isolated tragedy that happened to one unfortunate man and his family . In a real sense , this is the human condition which affects us all . Life will soon be over for everyone in this sanctuary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have determined to live each day as Christ would dictate , keeping in mind the temporal nature of everything which now seems so permanent . Even in death , you see , my dad has taught me about life . Thank you for allowing me to share my deepest feelings and emotions , today . I must acknowledge , in closing , that James Dobson was not a perfect man . It would be unfortunate to eulogize him in a way that would embarrass him if he were sitting among us . My father had a generous assortment of flaws , even as you and I. But I loved him . Perhaps . . . as much as any son ever loved his dad . Danae and Ryan addressed to my children , you had a great man for a grandfather . Not because he was President or because he will be remembered in the history books . He was great because of his uncompromising dedication to the Christian faith . And if I can be half the father to you that he was to me , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is God 's kiss upon the soul ! " ? Anonymous *Seven members of our family have died in the past eighteen months : my father , Shirley 's grandmother ( Mrs. Hassie Wisham ) , my uncle ( Dr. James McGraw ) , my aunt ( Mrs. Naomi Dobson ) , my great uncle and aunt ( Rev. and Mrs. R. M. Parks ) and Shirley 's uncle ( Mr. Al Frasher ) . 4 The Revelation T wo years before my father 's death , he shared an experience that occurred while he had been praying and reading the Bible . He seemed almost embarrassed to reveal the details , but I coaxed him to tell me the story . It involved an overwhelming impression , almost a divine decree , that he and I were going to cooperate on a very important project . He hastened to say that he did n't want me to think he was trying to " ride on my coattail . " In fact , his first impulse was to tell no one about the revelation for fear that his motives would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in life that when God " speaks " to Dad , I had better pay attention . This man and his Lord had a very unusual relationship . It often involved sessions of prayer and communion , lasting from four to six hours , focusing especially on his ministry and on those whom he loved . He was known in the small town where I spent my preschool years as " the // man with no leather on his shoes . " He spent so much time on his knees that he wore out the toes of his shoes before the soles . Thus , James Dobson , Sr. and the Lord had a very unique relationship . When God revealed His purpose to His faithful servant , the outcome was an absolute certainty . But what task would we accomplish together ? Neither of us knew the answer to that question , nor did we pursue it further . We did join forces to work on a conference book entitled Family under Fire , but that did n't seem to be related to the revelation . The months rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Things I do n't understand about the Lord . " Then came my father 's initial heart attack while I was in San Antonio . That devastating telephone conversation reverberated in my head . " Your dad is dying . He has developed both arhythmia and congestion , which is usually a fatal combination following a myocardial infarction . We do n't expect him to live through the night . Come as quickly as you can get here ! " Two friends rushed me to the airport , where Shirley was already waiting . But as we drove through the San Antonio traffic , the Lord spoke to me . His voice was not audible , nor was it accompanied by smoke and fire . I ca n't even tell you how the message was conveyed . All I know is that God reminded me of His revelation to my dad , and then said , " You are going to write a book for husbands and fathers , based on the life of your dad . The inspiration will be derived from his values , his dedication , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I spoke two years ago . " As we made that long plane ride from San Antonio to Kansas City , Shirley and I knew that my dad 's condition would be obvious instantly as we stepped into the terminal . If my mother was there to meet us , that would mean he was gone . But if she were not present , then she would still be with him at the hospital . Upon disembarking from the plane , we scanned the crowd breathlessly and to our great relief , Mother was not there . Instead , we were greeted by the wife of the president of the college where my father served as a professor . And she was smiling . // " Your dad is remarkably better , " she said . " In fact , he 's waiting to see you at the hospital . " I will always be thankful for having the priceless opportunity to see him alive , again ? to express those words of appreciation and love that we seldom convey before it is too late . I stood by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oscilloscopes and bottles of glucose , I patted those delicate artistic hands that I have loved since my earliest awareness . He was entirely calm and coherent , revealing no hint of his brush with death . Then I told him about the Lord 's message to me on the way to the airport . I explained that his part of the project was already completed : it involved sixty-six years of integrity and devotion and love . I had watched him at home throughout my childhood , where it was impossible to hide his true nature . But never one time did I see him compromise with evil or abandon the faith by which he had lived . His character had been like a beacon for me , illuminating my way and steering me past the snares that entrapped so many of my friends . " Thank you , Dad , " I said , with deep emotion . He smiled knowingly , and I quietly slipped out of his room . Though the months have passed and he is now gone , that conversation lingers as I begin my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have been his sixty-eighth birthday , and it is fitting that I use this occasion to describe the values for which he stood . But this book is not intended as a biography of my dad 's life , by any means . In fact , its primary theme actually originated three years before his death . I had asked the Lord , as a special favor , to reveal His message to the Christian family . I prayed , " As long as I 'm going to be speaking and writing and attempting to influence husbands and wives and children , I would like to know what you want me to convey . Why should I depend on my own puny insight and wisdom , when I can tap the resources of the Creator of families ? Give me , then , the concepts that you want me to communicate . " // Again , I experienced one of those quiet moments of awareness when I knew the Lord had spoken . It should be emphasized that for me , at least , these examples of unmistakable leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learn of His will through providential circumstances , doors that open or close , and so on . But on a few occasions , His desires have been communicated directly from His heart to mine . Such was the case in response to my prayer for wisdom and insight ( although it sounds terribly pompous and selfimportant to relate now ) . But this was God 's reply , translated into my own words : " If America is going to survive the incredible stresses and dangers it now faces , it will be because husbands and fathers again place their families at the highest level on their system of priorities , reserving a portion of their time and energy for leadership within their homes ! " I have been dutifully conveying that message at every opportunity for the past twenty years . I 've said it on the radio , on television , on audio cassettes and on film . The time has come , at last , to put it in writing , where the concept can be explored in its many dimensions . That brings us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let me be honest about what it means to me . I suspect that authors often write a new manuscript in the same spirit that General Motors brings out a new model . It merely takes its place in a long line of creations , having no more significance than the one before or after . However , I feel that my message to men is the most critical topic I have ever addressed , and as such , may be the task for which I was born . The Western world stands at a great crossroads in its history . And it is my opinion , based on the experience I shared , that our very survival as a people will depend on the presence or absence of masculine leadership in millions of homes . Why do I place such importance on the involvement of men in determining the survival of a culture ? Because no modern society can exceed the stability of its individual family units , and women seem more aware of that fact than their // husbands . Consider the evidence . Who read the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . Who attend seminars on meaningful family life ? The majority are women . Who enroll in Bible study classes devoted to Scriptural underpinnings of the family ? Women outnumber men by an incredible margin . Who listen to family radio programs and cassette tapes on marriage and parenthood ? Once again , they are likely to be female . What I 'm saying is that Christian women , to a large extent , are already motivated to preserve their families . And though I hate to admit it , women often know more than their husbands about the role God has ordained for men . One of the most common letters I receive is sent by hundreds of women who ask the same question : My husband wo n't assume spiritual leadership in our family . He does n't seem to be aware of my needs and the requirements of our children . How can I get his attention ? That 's why I believe , with everything within me , that husbands hold the keys to the preservation of the family . If we can get men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some will make the changes necessary for survival . And I 'm certain that their wives will follow suit . Derek Prince expressed his view that the major problems facing the Western world can be traced to what he called " renegade males . " A renegade is defined as " one who reneges . " It is a harsh indictment , but there is validity in the assessment . God has charged men with the responsibility for providing leadership in their homes and families : leadership in the form of loving authority ; leadership in the form of financial management ; leadership in the form of spiritual training ; and leadership in maintaining the marital relationship . Husbands are instructed to " love their wives , just as Christ loved the Church and gave himself up for her " ( Eph. 5:25 , NIV ) . That is not a casual suggestion to Christian men ; it is God 's commandment to husbands and fathers . This book , then , is a call to // arms . . . an urgent plea for men to recommit themselves to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be God 's concept of masculinity . And , as might be expected , he learned it from his father . We 'll discuss the life of R. L. Dobson , my paternal grandfather , in a subsequent chapter . 5 The Heritage D uring the Christmas season 1969 , my father 's two surviving brothers and his sister gathered in California for a family reunion . And on that happy occasion , they spent the better part of five days reminiscing about their childhood and early home life . One of the grandchildren had enough initiative to record the discussions on cassette tapes , and I was privileged to obtain a complete set . What a rich heritage this provided , granting insight into my grandparents ' home and the early experiences of my dad . While all the conversations were of interest to me , there was a common thread that was especially significant throughout the week . It focused on the respect with which these four siblings addressed the memory of their father ( my grandfather ) . He died in 1935 , a year before my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe more than thirty-four years later . He still lived in their minds as a man of enormous character and strength . // I asked them to explain the qualities that they admired so greatly , but received little more than vague generalities . " He was a tower of strength , " said one . " He had a certain dignity about him , " said another , with appropriate gestures . " We held him in awe , " replied the third . It is difficult to summarize the subtleties and complexities of the human personality , and they were unable to find the right words . Only when we began talking about specific remembrances did the personality of this patriarch become apparent . My dad provided the best evidence by writing his recollection of Grandfather Dobson 's death , which I 've reproduced below . Flowing throughout this narrative is the impact of a great man on his family , even three decades after his demise . The Last Days of R. L. Dobson The attack that took his life occurred when he was sixty-nine years of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle . For many years after his death , I could not pass Tri-State Hospital without noting one particular window . It stood out from the rest , hallowed because it represented the room where he had suffered so much . The details of those tragic days and nights remain in my memory , unchanged by the passage of time . We had been three days and three nights practically without sleep , listening to him struggle for breath , hearing the sounds of approaching death , smelling the smells of death . Dad lay in a deep coma . His heavy breathing could be heard up and down the corridor . We walked the halls of that old hospital for hours listening to the ceaseless struggle which now was becoming fainter and fainter . Several times the nurse had called us in and we had said the last " good-bye " ? had gone through the agony of giving him up , only to have his heart rally , and then the endless vigil would begin all over // again . Finally , we had gone into an adjoining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some across the beds , we had fallen into the sleep of utter exhaustion . At five minutes to four o'clock the nurse came in and awakened one of my twin brothers . Robert roused with a start . " Is he gone ? " he asked . " No , but if you boys want to see your dad one more time while he is alive , you 'd better come , now . " The word quickly passed around and we filed into the room to stand around his bed for the last time . I remember that I stood at his left side : I smoothed back the hair from his forehead , and laid my hand on his big old red hand , so very much like my own . I felt the fever that precedes death : 105 . While I was standing there a change came over me . Instead of being a grown man ( I was twenty-four at the time ) I became a little boy again . They say this often happens to adults who witness the death of a parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Shreveport , Louisiana , in the late afternoon , and I was watching for his return . The old Kansas City Southern passenger train was backing into the station and I saw it come ' round the curve . My heart swelled with pride . I turned to the little boy standing next to me and said , " You see that big man standing on the back of the train , one hand on the air brake and the other on the little whistle with which he signals the engineer ? That big man is my dad ! " He set the air brakes and I heard the wheels grind to a stop . I saw him step off that last coach . I ran and jumped into his arms . I gave him a tight hug and I smelled the train smoke on his clothes . " Daddy , I love you , " I said . It all comes back . I patted that big hand and said " Goodbye , Dad , " as he was sinking fast , now . " We have n't forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl through college : how you wore those old conductor uniforms until they were slick ? doing without ? that we might have things that we did n't really need .... " At three minutes to four o'clock , like a stately ship moving slowly out of time 's harbor into eternity 's sea , he breathed // his last . The nurse motioned us to leave , and pulled the sheet over his head , a gesture that struck terror to my heart , and we turned with silent weeping to leave the room . Then an incident occurred that I will never forget . Just as we got to the door , I put my arm around my little mother and said , " Mama , this is awful . " Dabbing at her eyes with her handkerchief , she said , " Yes , Jimmy , but there is one thing Mother wants you to remember , now . We have said ' good night ' down here , but one of these days we are going to say ' good morning ' up there . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven years later , and I know he met her " just inside the Eastern gate . " His death was marked by quietness and dignity , just like the life he had lived . Thus came to an end the affairs of R. L. Dobson , and thus ended , too , the solidarity of the family . The old home place was never the same again . The old spirit that we had known as children was gone forever ! Though this illustration reveals few of the specific characteristics that made R. L. Dobson such a powerful influence in his family , it does tell us how his son felt about him . I happen to know some of the other details . He was a man of absolute integrity and honesty . Though not a Christian until shortly before his death , he lived by an internal standard that was singularly uncompromising . As a young man , for example , he invested heavily in a business venture with a partner whom he later discovered to be dishonest . When he learned of the chicanery , he virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partner built the corporation into one of the most successful operations in the South , and became a multimillionaire . But my grandfather never looked back . He took a clean conscience with him to his grave . There were other admirable traits , of course , and many of them were transmitted to my dad . These two men personified much of what I 'm trying to convey in this examination of masculinity . My father added the dimension of vulnerability to the pattern , which is beautifully captured // in the drawing by Ray Craighead ( his art student ) reproduced on the dedication page of this book . Having looked superficially at the image of two strong fathers and their influence at home , let 's turn now to the specifics . We 'll discuss the interaction of a man with his children , his wife , his work , and his God , among related subjects . And as we do , may I make a suggestion for those who enjoy a personal relationship with the Lord ? You might pause to ask him , prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convey through the pages of this book . It is my desire that He speak to each family ( and especially to each man ) in the terms we need to hear . 6 A Man and His Children I was walking toward my car outside a shopping center a few weeks ago , when I heard a loud and impassioned howl . " Auggghh ! " groaned the masculine voice . I spotted a man about fifty feet away who was in great distress ( and for a very good reason ) . His fingers were caught in the jamb of a car door which had obviously been slammed unexpectedly . Then the rest of the story unfolded . Crouching in the front seat was an impish little three-year-old boy who had apparently decided to " close the door on dad . " The father was pointing frantically at his fingers with his free hand , and saying , " Oh ! Oh ! Open the door , Chuckie ! They'recaught . . . hurry ... Chuckle . . . please . . . open ... OPEN ! " Chuckie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dad 's blue fingers . The father then hopped and jumped around the aisles of the parking lot , alternately kissing and caressing his battered hand . Chuckie sat unmoved in the front seat of their car , waiting for Pop to settle down . // I know this incident was painful to the man who experienced it , but I must admit that it struck me funny . I suppose his plight symbolized the enormous cost of parenthood . And yes , Virginia , it is expensive to raise boys and girls today . Parents give the best they have to their children , who often respond by slamming the door on their " fingers " ? especially during the unappreciative adolescent years . Perhaps that is why someone quipped , " Insanity is an inherited disease . You get it from your kids . " But there are other things that we get from our kids , including love and meaning and purpose and an opportunity to give . They also help us maintain our sense of humor , which is essential to emotional stability in these stressful days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom she described in her book Disciplines of a Beautiful Woman .

" Nels answered on his own behalf , " I sleep very well . " The nurse wrote that down . " How 's his appetite , Mrs. Ortlund ? " " I eat everything , " said Nels . She wrote that down . " Mrs. Ortlund , how are his bowels ? " The boy responded , " A , E , I , 0 and U. " * Those memories are priceless to the parent who is n't too tired to notice . Let me share one more true story .

But never having been in an earthquake before , he thought the rumble had been caused by his own bathroom activity . " What did I do , Mom ?

Although my kids are now grown , I can recall ten thousand episodes that are carefully preserved in my mind . The " videotapes " of their early years are among my most valued possessions : even now , I see a six-year-old girl coming home from school . Her hair is disheveled and one sock is down around her ankle . It is obvious that she 's been spinning upside down on the playground bars . She asks for a glass of milk and sits down at the kitchen table , unaware of the tenderness and love that I feel for her at that moment . Then she runs out to play . Another " tape " begins to roll .

Our daughter , especially , has loved every aspect of childhood and has been most reluctant to leave it . Her phonograph records and her stuffed animals and her bedroom have been prized possessions since toddlerhood . Likewise , she sat on Santa 's lap for four years after she knew he was a phony . But , alas , she turned thirteen years old and began hearing a new set of drums . About a year later , she went through her toys and records , stacking them neatly and leaving them in front of Ryan 's bedroom door .

Love , Danae That brief message signaled the closing of the door called " Childhood . " And once it shut , no power on earth could open it again . That 's why the toddler and elementary school years should be seen as fleeting opportunities . Yet this priceless period of influence often occurs at a time when fathers are the least accessible to their kids . They are trying to establish themselves in their occupations , racing and running and huffing and puffing , dragging home a briefcase crammed to the brim with night work , scurrying to the airport to catch the last plane to Chicago , moonlighting to pay those vacation bills , and finally collapsing in bed in a state of utter exhaustion . Another day has passed with no interchange between Dad and his teachable little boy or girl . One mother told me of hearing her preschool son talking to another four-year-old boy on the front steps . " Where is your daddy ? " he asked . " I 've never seen him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " came the reply . " He only sleeps here . " // Without wanting to heap guilt on the heads of my masculine readers , I must say that too many fathers only sleep at their homes . And as a result , they have totally abdicated their responsibilities for leadership and influence in the lives of their children . I cited a study in my previous book What Wives Wish Their Husbands Knew About Women that documented the problem of inaccessible fathers . Let me quote from that source . An article in Scientific American entitled " The Origins of Alienation , " by Urie Bronfenbrenner best describes the problems facing today 's families . Dr. Bronfenbrenner is , in my opinion , the foremost authority on child development in America today , and his views should be considered carefully . In this article , Dr. Bronfenbrenner discussed the deteriorating status of the American family and the forces which are weakening its cohesiveness . More specifically , he is concerned about the circumstances which are seriously undermining parental love and depriving children of the leadership and love they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know as the " rat-race . " Dr. Bronfenbrenner described the problem this way , " The demands of a job that claim mealtimes , evenings and weekends as well as days ; the trips and moves necessary to get ahead or simply to hold one 's own ; the increasing time spent commuting , entertaining , going out , meeting social and community obligations . . . all of these produce a situation in which a child often spends more time with a passive babysitter than with a participating parent . " According to Dr. Bronfenbrenner , this rat race is particularly incompatible with fatherly responsibilities , as illustrated by a recent investigation which yielded startling results . A team of researchers wanted to learn how much time middleclass fathers spend playing and interacting with their small children . First , they asked a group of fathers to estimate the time spent with their one-year-old youngsters each day , and received an average reply of fifteen to twenty minutes . To verify these claims , the investigators attached microphones to the shirts of small children for the purpose of recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shocking : The average amount of time spent by these middle-class fathers with their small children was thirty-seven seconds per day ! Their direct interaction was limited to 2.7 encounters daily , lasting ten to fifteen seconds each ! That , so it seems , represents the contribution of fatherhood for millions of America 's children. * Let 's compare the thirty-seven-second interchanges between fathers and small children with another statistic . The average preschool child watches between 30 and 50 hours of television per week ( the figures vary from one study to another ) . What an incredible picture is painted by those two statistics . During the formative years of life , when children are so vulnerable to their experiences , they 're receiving thirtyseven seconds a day from their fathers and thirty or more hours a week from commercial television ! Need we ask where our kids are getting their values ? Someone observed , " Values are not taught to our children ; they are caught by them . " It is true . Seldom can we get little Johnny or Mary to sit patiently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the other important issues of life . Instead , they are equipped with internal " motors " which are incapable of idling . Their transmissions consist of only six gears : run , jump , climb , crawl , slide and dive . Boys and girls are simply not wired for quiet conversations about heavy topics . How , then , do conscientious parents convey their attitudes and values and faith to their children ? It is done subtly , through the routine interactions of everyday living. ** We saw this fact illustrated in our own home when Danae was ten years old and Ryan was five . We were riding in the car when we passed a porno theater . I believe the name of the particular movie was " Flesh Gordon , " or something equally // sensuous . Danae , who was sitting in the front seat , pointed to the theater and said , " That 's a dirty movie , is n't it , Dad ? " I nodded affirmatively . " Is that what they call an X-rated movie ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought for a moment or two , then said , " Dirty movies are really bad , are n't they ? " I said , " Yes , Danae . Dirty movies are very evil . " This entire conversation lasted less than a minute , consisting of three brief questions and three replies . Ryan , who was in the back seat , did not enter into our discussion . In fact , I wondered what he thought about the interchange , and concluded that he probably was n't listening . I was wrong . Ryan heard the conversation and apparently continued thinking about it for several days . But amusingly , Ryan did not know what a " dirty movie " was . How would a five-year-old boy learn what goes on in such places , since no one had ever discussed pornography with him ? Nevertheless , he had his own idea about the subject . That concept was revealed to me four nights later at the close of the day . Ryan and I got down on our knees to say his bedtime prayer , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dear Lord , " he began in great seriousness , " help me not to go see any dirty movies ... where everyone is spitting on each other . " For Ryan , the dirtiest thing he could imagine would be a salivary free-for-all . That would be dirty , I had to admit . But I also had to acknowledge how casually children assimilate our values and attitudes . You see , I had no way of anticipating that brief conversation in the car . It was not my deliberate intention to convey my views about pornography to my children . How was it that they learned one more dimension of my value system on that morning ? It occurred because we happened to be together . . . to be talking to one another . Those kinds of subtle , unplanned interactions account // for much of the instruction that passes from one generation to the next . It is a powerful force in shaping young lives , if ! If parents are occasionally at home with their kids ; if they have the energy to converse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if they care . My point is that the breathless American lifestyle is particularly costly to children . Yet 1.8 million youngsters come home to an empty house after school each day . They are called " latchkey " kids because they wear the keys to their front doors around their necks . Not only are their fathers overcommitted and preoccupied , but now , their mothers are energetically seeking fulfillment in the working world , too . So who is at home with the kids ? More commonly , the answer is nobody . A popular song beautifully portrays the cost of overcommitment in family life . It was written by Sandy and Harry Chapin , who titled it " Cat 's in the Cradle . " I 've obtained permission to reproduce the lyrics , as follows , specifically for the fathers who are reading this book : Cat 's in the Cradle By Sandy and Harry Chapin My child arrived just the other day he came to the world in the usual way But there were planes to catch and bills to pay he learned to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it and as he grew he 'd say I 'm gon na be like you , Dad you know I 'm gon na be like you . and the cat 's in the cradle and the silver spoon Little boy blue and the man in the moon when you comin ' home , Dad // I do n't know when but we 'll get together then you know we 'll have a good time then My son turned 10 just the other day he said , Thanks for the ball , Dad , com'on let 's play Can you teach me to throw ?

When you comin ' home , Son ? I do n't know when but we 'll get together then you know we 'll have a good time then I 've long since retired , my son 's moved away I called him up just the other day I said I 'd like to see you if you do n't mind He said , I 'd love to , Dad ? if I can find the time You see my new job 's a hassle and the kids have the flu but it 's sure nice talkin to you , Dad It 's been nice talking to you // And as I hung up the phone , it occurred to me ? he 'd grown up just like me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the cradle and the silver spoon Like boy blue and the man in the moon when you comin ' home , Son ? I do n't know when but we 'll get together then , Dad , we 're gon na have a good time then Do those words strike home to anyone but me ? Have you felt the years slipping by with far too many unfulfilled promises to your children ? Have you heard yourself saying , Son , we 've been talking about that wagon we were going to build one of these Saturdays , and I just want you to know that I have n't forgotten it . But we ca n't do it this weekend ' cause I have to make an unexpected trip to Indianapolis . However , we will get to it one of these days . I 'm not sure if it can be next weekend , but you keep reminding me and we 'll eventually work together . And I 'm going to take you fishing , too . I love to fish and I know a little stream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just happens to be a very busy month for your mom and me , so let 's keep planning and before you know it , the time will be here . Then the days soon become weeks , and the weeks flow into months and years and decades . . . and our kids grow up and leave home . Then we sit in the silence of our family rooms , trying to recall the precious experiences that escaped us there . Ringing in our ears is that haunting phrase , " We 'll have a good time . . . then ... " Oh , I know I 'm stirring a measure of guilt into the pot with these words . But perhaps we need to be confronted with the important issues of life , even if they make us uncomfortable . Furthermore , I feel obligated to speak on behalf of the millions of children around the world who are reaching for fathers who are n't there . The names of specific boys and girls come to my mind as I write these words , symbolizing the // masses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me acquaint you with two or three of those children whose paths I have crossed . I think , first of the mother who approached me after I had spoken some years ago . She had supported her husband through college and medical school , only to have him divorce her in favor of a younger plaything . She stood with tears in her eyes as she described the impact of his departure on her two sons . " They miss their daddy every day , " she said . " They do n't understand why he does n't come to see them . The older boy , especially , wants a father so badly that he reaches for every man who comes into our lives . What can I tell him ? How can I meet the boy 's needs for a father who will hunt and fish and play football and bowl with him and his brother ? It 's breaking my heart to see them suffer so much . " I gave this mother a few suggestions and offered my understanding and support . The next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Following the service , I stood on the platform as a line of people waited to tell me good-bye and extend their greetings . Standing in the line was the mother with her two sons . They greeted me with smiles and I shook the older child 's hand . Then something happened which I did not recall until I was on my way back to Los Angeles . The boy did not let go of my hand ! He gripped it tightly , preventing me from welcoming others who pressed around . To my regret , I realized later that I had unconsciously grasped his arm with my other hand , pulling myself free from his grip . I sat on the plane , realizing the full implications of that incident . You see , this lad needed me . He needed a man who could take the place of his renegade father . And I had failed him , just like all the rest . Now I 'm left with the memory of a child who said with his eyes , " Could you be a daddy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in my memory , although I do n't even know her name . I was waiting to catch a plane at Los Angeles International Airport , enjoying my favorite activity of " people watching . " But I was // unprepared for the drama about to unfold . Standing near me was an old man who was obviously waiting for someone who should have been on the plane that arrived minutes before . He examined each face intently as the passengers filed past . I thought he seemed unusually distressed as he waited . Then I saw the little girl who stood by his side . She must have been seven years old , and she , too , was desperately looking for a certain face in the crowd . I have rarely seen a child more anxious than this cute little girl . She clung to the old man 's arm , who I assumed to be her grandfather . Then as the last passengers came by , one by one , the girl began to cry silently . She was not merely disappointed in that moment ; her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fighting back the tears . In fact , he was too upset to comfort the child , who then buried her face in the sleeve of his worn coat . " Oh , God ! " I prayed silently . " What special agony are they experiencing in this hour ? Was it the child 's mother who abandoned her on that painful day ? Did her daddy promise to come and then change his mind ? " My great impulse was to throw my arms around the little girl and shield her from the awfulness of that hour . I wanted her to pour out her grief in the protection of my embrace , but I feared that my intrusion would be misunderstood . So I watched helplessly . Then the old man and the child stood silently as the passengers departed from two other planes , but the anxiety on their faces had turned to despair . Finally , they walked slowly through the terminal and toward the door . Their only sound was the snuffing of the little girl who fought to control her tears . Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reader will bear with me , I must introduce you to one other child whose family experience has become so common in the Western world . I was waiting at Shawnee Mission Hospital for word on my dad 's heart condition , after he was stricken in September . There in the waiting room was an American Girl magazine which caught my attention . ( I must // have been desperate for something to read to have been attracted to the American Girl . ) I opened the cover page and immediately saw a composition written by a fourteen-year-old girl named Vicki Kraushaar . She had submitted her story for publication in the section of the magazine entitled " By You . " I 'll let Vicki introduce herself and describe her experience . That 's the Way Life Goes Sometimes When I was ten , my parents got a divorce . Naturally , my father told me about it , because he was my favorite . Notice that Vicki did not say , " I was his favorite . " " Honey , I know it 's been kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't want to make it worse . But there 's something I have to tell you . Honey , your mother and I got a divorce . " " But , Daddy ? " " I know you do n't want this , but it has to be done . Your mother and I just do n't get along like we used to . I 'm already packed and my plane is leaving in half an hour . " " But , Daddy , why do you have to leave ? " " Well , honey , your mother and I ca n't live together anymore . " " I know that , but I mean why do you have to leave town ? " " Oh . Well , I got someone waiting for me in New Jersey . " " But , Daddy , will I ever see you again ? " " Sure you will , honey . We 'll work something out . " " But what ? I mean , you 'll be living in New Jersey , and I 'll be living here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you spending two weeks in the summer and two in the winter with me . " " Why not more often ? " " I do n't think she 'll agree to two weeks in the summer and two in the winter , much less more . " " Well , it ca n't hurt to try . " " I know , honey , but we 'll have to work it out later . My plane leaves in twenty minutes and I 've got to get to the airport . Now I 'm going to get my luggage , and I want you to go to your room so you do n't have to watch me . And no long good-byes either . " // " Okay , Daddy . Good-bye . Do n't forget to write . " " I wo n't . Good-bye . Now go to your room . " " Okay . Daddy , I do n't want you to go ! " " I know , honey . But I have to . " " Why ? " " You would n't understand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , you would n't . " " Oh well . Good-bye . " " Good-bye . Now go to your room . Hurry up . " " Okay . Well , I guess that 's the way life goes sometimes . " " Yes honey . That 's the way life goes sometimes . " After my father walked out that door , I never heard from him again. * Vicki speaks eloquently on behalf of a million American children who have heard those shattering words , " Honey , your mother and I are getting a divorce . " Throughout the world , husbands and wives are responding to the media blitz which urges and goads them to do their own thing , to chase impulsive desires without regard for the welfare of their families . " The kids will get over it , " goes the rationalization . Every form of mass communication seemed mobilized to spread the " me first " philosophy during the 1970s and early 1980s . Frank Sinatra said it musically in his song , " I did it my way . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got ta be me . " Robert J. Ringer provided the literary version in Looking Out for Number One , which became the best-selling book in America for forty-six weeks . It was flanked by Open Marriage , Creative Divorce , and Pulling Your Own Strings , among hundreds of other dangerous best sellers . The est program then sold the same sickness under the guise of psychological health . It all sounded so noble at the time . It was called " the discovery of personhood , " and if offered an intoxicating appeal // to our selfish lusts . But when this insidious philosophy had wormed its way into our system of values , it began to rot us from within . First , it encouraged an insignificant flirtation with sin ( perhaps with a man or woman from New Jersey ) followed by passion and illicit sexual encounters , followed by camouflaging lies and deceit , followed by angry words and sleepless nights , followed by tears and anguish , followed by crumbling self-esteem , followed by attorneys and divorce courts and property settlements , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maelstrom , we can hear the cry of three wounded children ? two girls and a boy ? who will never fully recover . " Then when lust hath conceived , it bringeth forth sin ; and sin , when it is finished , bringeth forth death " ( James 1:15 , KJv ) . Lest I sound self-righteous and " preachy , " let me focus the glaring spotlight on my own inadequacies . While I have never been involved in an affair , nor will I ever , there have certainly been times when I have permitted overcommitment to rob my children of my involvement . I 'll reveal the details in the following chapter for those who have the inclination to continue . My father often quoted Eugene Field 's " Little Boy Blue " to me when I was a child . This poem has always been a favorite , but it has assumed new meaning since the birth of my children . Little Boy Blue The little toy dog is covered with dust , But sturdy and staunch he stands ; And the little toy soldier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands . Time was when the little toy dog was new , And the soldier was passing fair ; And that was the time when our Little Boy Blue Kissed them and put them there . " Now , do n't you go till I come , " he said , " And do n't you make any noise ! " // So , toddling off to his trundle-bed , He dreamt of the pretty toys ; And , as he was dreaming , an angel song Awakened our Little Boy Blue Oh ! the years are many , the years are long , But the little toy friends are True ! Ay , faithful to Little Boy Blue they stand , Each in the same old place Awaiting the touch of a little hand , The smile of a little face ; And they wonder , as waiting the long years through In the dust of that little chair , What has become of our Little Boy Blue Since he kissed them and put them there . Eugene Field . 1850-1895 7 A Man and His Ultimate Priority I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being written . I was running at an incredible speed , working myself to death like every other man I knew . I was Superintendent of Youth for my church , and labored under a heavy speaking schedule . Eight or ten " unofficial " responsibilities were added to my full-time commitment at USC School of Medicine and Children 's Hospital of Los Angeles . I once worked seventeen nights straight without being home in the evening . Our five-year-old daughter would stand in the doorway and cry as I left in the morning , knowing she might not see me until the next sunrise . Although my activities were bringing me professional advancement and the trappings of financial success , my dad was not impressed . He had observed my hectic lifestyle and felt obligated to express his concern . While flying from Los Angeles to Hawaii one summer , he used that quiet opportunity to write me a lengthy letter . It was to have a sweeping // influence on my life . Let me quote one paragraph from his message which was especially poignant : Danae referring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a world much farther gone into moral decline than the world into which you were born . I have observed that the greatest delusion is to suppose that our children will be devout Christians simply because their parents have been , or that any of them will enter into the Christian faith in any other way than through their parents ' deep travail of prayer and faith . But this prayer demands time , time that can not be given if it is all signed and conscripted and laid on the altar of career ambition . Failure for you at this point would make mere success in your occupation a very pale and washed-out affair , indeed . Those words , written without accusation or insult , hit me like the blow from a hammer . It contained several themes which had the ring of eternal truth . First , it is more difficult to teach proper values today than in years past because of the widespread rejection of Christian principles in our culture . In effect , there are many dissonant voices which feverishly contradict everything for which Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have discarded the moral standards of the Bible . Numerous studies have documented the steady increase in promiscuity occurring among teenagers and college-aged young people . For example , the American Journal of Diseases of Children* reported that of 677 seventh , eighth , and ninth graders in a mostly white , lower middle class junior high in Indianapolis , 55 percent had had sex . More than 50 percent of the boys had intercourse by age thirteen , and more than 50 percent of the girls had intercourse by sixteen . Quoting from Josh McDowell 's book , The Myth of Sex Education , " A 1987 study by the National Academy of Science discovered , ' the attitude shift has been best documented // among girls . From 1971 to 1982 , the proportion of unmarried girls aged 15-19 who had had sexual intercourse at least once increased from 28 percent to 44 percent . " * This is the world in which our children are being raised . We need all the help we can get to lead them through the mine fields of adolescence . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ended my parental complacency . He helped me realize that it is possible for mothers and fathers to love and revere God while systematically losing their children . You can go to church three times a week , serve on its governing board , attend the annual picnic , pay your tithes and make all the approved religious noises , yet somehow fail to communicate the real meaning of Christianity to the next generation . I have since talked to dozens of parents whose children are grown and married . " We thought our kids had accepted our faith and beliefs , " they say , " but somehow , we failed to get it across . " For those younger parents whose children are still at an impressionable age , please believe the words of my dad , " The greatest delusion is to suppose that our children will be devout Christians simply because their parents have been , or that any of them will enter into the Christian faith in any other way than through their parents ' deep travail of prayer and faith . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you read the story of Eli in 1 Samuel 2-4 . Here is the account of a priest and servant of God who failed to discipline his children . He was apparently too busy with the " work of the church " to be a leader in his own home . The two boys grew up to be evil young men on whom God 's judgment fell . It concerned me to realize that Eli 's service to the Lord was insufficient to compensate for his failure at home . Then I read farther in the narrative and received confirmation of the // principle . Samuel , the saintly man of God who stood like a tower of spiritual strength throughout his life , grew up in Eli 's home . He watched Eli systematically losing his children , yet Samuel proceeded to fail with his family , too ! That was a deeply disturbing truth . If God would not honor Samuel 's dedication by guaranteeing the salvation of his children , will He do more for me if I 'm too busy to do my " homework " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Lord then gave me an enormous burden for my two children . I carry it to this day . There are times when it becomes so heavy that I ask God to remove it from my shoulders , although the concern is not motivated by the usual problems or anxieties . Our kids are apparently healthy and seem to be holding their own emotionally and academically . ( Update : Danae finished college in 1990 and Ryan was entering his junior year at the time of the revision . ) The source of my burden derives from the awareness that a " tug of war " is being waged for the hearts and minds of every child on earth , including these two precious human beings . Satan would deceive and destroy them if given the opportunity , and they will soon have to choose the path they will take . This mission of introducing one 's children to the Christian faith can be likened to a three-man relay race . First , your father runs his lap around the track , carrying the baton , which represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he hands the baton to you , and you begin your journey around the track . Then finally , the time will come when you must get the baton safely in the hands of your child . But as any track coach will testify , relay races are won or lost in the transfer of the baton . There is a critical moment when all can be lost by a fumble or miscalculation . The baton is rarely dropped on the back side of the track when the runner has it firmly in his grasp . If failure is to occur , it will likely happen in the exchange between generations ! According to the Christian values which govern my life , my most important reason for living is to get the baton ? the gospel ? safely in the hands of my children . Of course , I want to place // it in as many other hands as possible , and I 'm deeply devoted to the ministry to families that God has given me . Nevertheless , my number one responsibility is to evangelize my own children . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " pale and washed out " when compared with that fervent desire . Unless my son and daughter grasp the faith and take it with them around the track , it matters little how fast they run . Being first across the finish line is meaningless unless they carry the baton with them . The urgency of this mission has taken Shirley and me to our knees since before the birth of our first child . Furthermore , since October 1971 until early 1978 , I designated one day a week for fasting and prayer specifically devoted to the spiritual welfare of our children . ( Shirley then accepted the responsibility and continues it to this day . ) This commitment springs from an intense awareness of our need for divine assistance in the awesome task of parenthood . There is not enough knowledge in the books ? not enough human wisdom anywhere on earth ? to guarantee the outcome of parenting . There are too many factors beyond our control ? too many evil influences ? that mitigate against the Christian message . That is why we find ourselves in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Lord , here we are again . You know what we need even before we ask , but let us say it one more time . When You consider the many requests we have made of You through the years ... regarding our health and my ministry and the welfare of our loved ones . . . please put this supplication at the top of the list : keep the circle of our little family unbroken when we stand before You on the Day of Judgment . Compensate for our mistakes and failures as parents , and counteract the influences of an evil world that would undermine the faith of our children . And especially , Lord , we ask for Your involvement when our son and daughter stand at the crossroads , deciding whether or not to walk the Christian path . They will be beyond our care at that moment , and we humbly ask You to be there . Send a significant friend or leader to help them // choose the right direction . They were yours before they were born , and now we give them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them even more than we do . Toward that end , we dedicate this day of fasting and prayer . Not only has God heard this prayer , but He has blessed it in ways that we did not anticipate in the beginning . First , it has represented a project which Shirley and I have enjoyed together , drawing us closer to one another as we drew closer to God . Secondly , this act of fasting each week serves to remind us continually of our system of priorities . It is very difficult to forget your highest values when one day out of seven is spent concentrating on them . Finally , and most importantly , the children have seen this act of discipline every Tuesday , and have been influenced by it . Conversations similar to the one below occurred throughout the critical years of childhood . " Why are you not eating dinner with us tonight , Dad ? " " This is Tuesday and I 'm fasting today . " " Oh , yeah ? what did you say ' fasting ' meant ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of special prayer . It 's a way of asking God for a blessing , or of expressing love to Him . " " What are you asking for ? " " Your mother and I are praying for you and your brother , today . We 're asking God to lead and direct your lives ; we want Him to help you choose a profession and to find the right person to marry , if that is His will . We 're also asking Him to walk with you every day of your lives . " " You must love us a lot to fast and pray like that . " " We do love you . And God loves you even more . " I suppose there 's another explanation behind my concern for the spiritual welfare of our two children . I 'm told that George McCluskey , my great-grandfather on the maternal side , carried a similar burden for his children through the final decades of his life . He invested the hour from eleven to twelve o'clock each morning to intercessory prayer for his // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bless his children ; he extended his request to generations not yet born ! In effect , my great-grandfather was praying for me . Toward the end of his life , the old man announced that God had made a very unusual promise to him . He was given the assurance that every member of four generations of our family would be Christians , including those yet to be born . He then died and the promise became part of the spiritual heritage that was passed to those of us in George McCluskey 's bloodline . Since I represent the fourth generation subsequent to the one that included my great-grandfather , his promise assumes added significance . It has , in fact , been fulfilled in a fascinating way . McCluskey and his wife were ministers and charter members in their church denomination . They brought two daughters into the world , one eventually becoming my grandmother and the other my great-aunt . Those two girls married men who were ministers in the same denomination as their parents . Between them , they produced a boy and four girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same denomination and the boy became one . Then came my generation . My cousin H. B. London and I were the first two members to reach the age for college , where we were roommates . During the first semester of our sophomore year , he announced that God had called him to be a minister in ( you guessed it ) the same denomination as his great-grandfather . And believe me , I began to get very nervous about the entire proposition ! I now represent the first , though not the only , member of four generations from the time of my great-grandfather who has not felt specifically " called " into the ministry . But considering the hundreds of times I have stood before audiences , talking about the gospel of Jesus Christ and its application to family life , I have to ask , " What 's the difference ? " ! God has marvelous methods of implementing His purposes in our lives . There have been times as I have sat on the platform of a large church , waiting to speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... and it seemed as though he was smiling mischievously from the beyond . // Though my great-grandfather is long dead , having died a year before my birth , he still provides the richest source of inspiration for me . It staggers the mind to realize that the prayers of this one man , spoken more than fifty years ago , reach across four generations of time and influence developments in my life today .

Anonymous 8 A Man and His Authority T he following " Letter to the Editor " appeared in Moody Monthly , dated February 1979 : The other day I was sitting in a muffler shop , waiting for a new muffler to be put in our car . A young Mommi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plopped down two seats away from mine . After three minutes , Mark began to demand " a dwink , " pointing to the pop machine . " No , Mark , " the Mommi said . But Mark knew , and I knew , by the way she said " no " that she really meant " keep pushing me and I 'll give in . " So Mark began his campaign . He threatened to hit her . He got on the floor and screamed . He accused her of not loving him . And he said some things that little Maxis or Marks should not say . It was too much . I turned to the Mommi and said , " Please , for Mark 's sake , discipline him ! He will thank you for it later . Buy a copy of Dr. James Dobson 's book , Dare to Discipline ( Tyndale ) for Mark 's sake and yours . " Did she ? I do n't know . Will you ? I hope so . // The letter was unsigned , so I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know how she feels , however , for I have also watched little Maxis and Marks do their thing in airports and restaurants and muffler shops across the country . And as you might guess , it is incredibly difficult for me to remain silent when I see a 40-pound child intimidate and outmaneuver his 150-pound parent . I 'm rarely as blunt as the writer of the letter above , although I once asked the mother of a four-year-old spitfire named Tara if her child 's name was spelled Terror . Mother did not reply . In the absence of parental leadership , some children become extremely obnoxious and defiant , especially in public places . Perhaps the best example was a ten-year-old boy named Robert , who was a patient of my good friend Dr. William Slonecker . Dr. Slonecker and his pediatric staff dreaded the days when Robert was scheduled for an office visit . He literally attacked the clinic , grabbing instruments and files and telephones . His passive mother could do little more than shake her head in bewilderment . During one physical examination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knew that the boy must be referred to a local dentist . But who would be given the honor ? A referral like Robert could mean the end of a professional friendship . Dr. Slonecker eventually decided to send him to an older dentist who reportedly understood children . The confrontation that followed now stands as one of the classic moments in the history of human conflict . Robert arrived in the dental office , prepared for battle . " Get in the chair , young man , " said the doctor . " No chance ! " replied the boy . " Son , I told you to climb onto the chair , and that 's what I intend for you to do , " said the dentist . Robert stared at his opponent for a moment and then replied , " If you make me get in that chair , I will take off all my clothes . " The dentist calmly said , " Son , take ' em off . " // The boy forthwith removed his shirt , undershirt , shoes and socks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , " said the dentist . " Now get on the chair . " " You did n't hear me , " sputtered Robert . " I said if you make me get on that chair , I will take off all my clothes . " " Son , take ' em off , " replied the man . Robert proceeded to remove his pants and shorts , finally standing totally naked before the dentist and his assistant . " Now , son , get in the chair , " said the doctor . Robert did as he was told , and sat cooperatively through the entire procedure . When the cavities were drilled and filled , he was instructed to step down from the chair . " Give me my clothes now , " said the boy . " I 'm sorry , " replied the dentist . " Tell you mother that we 're going to keep your clothes tonight . She can pick them up tomorrow . " Can you comprehend the shock Robert 's mother received when the door to the waiting room opened , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he was born ? The room was filled with patients , but Robert and his mom walked past them and into the hall . They went down a public elevator and into the parking lot , ignoring the snickers of onlookers . The next day , Robert 's mother returned to retrieve his clothes , and asked to have a word with the dentist . However , she did not come to protest . These were her sentiments : " You do n't know how much I appreciate what happened here yesterday . You see , Robert has been blackmailing me about his clothes for years . Whenever we are in a public place , such as a grocery store , he makes unreasonable demands of me . If I do n't immediately buy him what he wants , he threatens to take off all his clothes . You are the first person who has called his bluff , doctor , and the impact on Robert has been incredible ! " No great insight is required to recognize the need for discipline in the lives of Robert , Tara , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense would reveal as // much . Children who are permitted to rule their bewildered parents are among the most frustrated creatures in God 's universe , as they scream and protest and pound on the floor . Nevertheless , the humanistic theorists of our day have somehow concluded that what these kids need is freedom from adult leadership . Authority , even when it is permeated with love , is perceived as harmful to children . That incredible concept has given birth to a powerful political force operating within the Children 's Rights Movement ( CRM ) . Their objectives are outlined in a Child 's Bill of Rights , originally written by Dr. Richard Farson , * and paraphrased below : 1 . Children should have the right to make all their own decisions . CRM advocates consider this to be the fundamental right on which all others stand . As such , it proposes the annihilation of parental leadership . 2 . Children of any age should have the right to live where they choose . For example , if a three-year-old boy decided to move in with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from bringing him home . No kidding ! 3 . Children of any age should have the right to vote and be involved in any decisions that affect their lives ( whether governmental , ecclesiastical , educational , medical or familial. ) 4 . Children should have access to any information that is available to adults . No pornography or violence could be shielded from a child , nor could his medical or school records be withheld . 5 . Children should be permitted to engage in any sexual activity that is legal for their parents . If a fifteen-yearold boy elected to bring home a playmate to spend the night , his parents could only step aside and watch them shut the bedroom door . An eight-year-old girl could // pleasure an adult male with no legal implication for either generation , provided the consent was " mutual . " 6 . Children of any age should be totally responsible for their own educational pursuits , being free to quit school or attend only when convenient . Compulsory education would be eliminated at all grade levels . 7 . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of asking them to adapt to the world of adults . The meaning of this item is unclear ; I 'm assuming it would be illegal to build adultsized furniture or put drinking fountains at their present height . 8 . Children should never be spanked under any circumstances , whether at school or at home . 9 . Children should be guaranteed the same system of justice that now applies to adults . No minor disciplinary action could occur at school , for example , until the child was tried , faced by his accusers , informed of the evidence against him , and pronounced guilty by a jury of his peers . 10 . Children of any age should be permitted to join a labor union , seek employment , receive equal pay for equal work , sign legal contracts , manage all of their own money , and be financially independent . The scrawled signature of a seven-year-old would be legally binding . It has even been suggested by John Holt and others that children should receive a guaranteed income , although it is unclear whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt about the objective of these extreme " Children 's Rights " advocates ? They do not wish merely to weaken parental authority ; they want to kill it , once and for all . Their stated goals represent , in essence , a series of prohibitions for parents and teachers . No , sir , you ca n't require your eight year old to go to school , or live at home , or feed the dog , or attend church , or take his medicine , or speak respectfully to parents , or be home by midnight , or clean his // room , or return the stolen toy , or avoid X-rated movies , or stop playing " doctor " with the child next door , or quit drinking liquor . No , sir , you will go to jail if you deprive you child of his rights in this fashion . You are the " peer " of your son , not his leader . " Talk is cheap , " I can hear a few readers saying . " Just because a kookie psychologist offers some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions will be imposed on my family . " I 'm not so confident . The first major triumph for CRM was achieved in Sweden , 1979 , when it became illegal for parents to spank or otherwise punish their children . The law , which the Swedish Parliament passed by a vote of 259-6 , prohibits " any act which , for the purpose of punishing , causes the child injury or pain , even if the disturbance is mild and passing . " The intent also prohibits psychological punishment such as scoldings , sending the child to the bedroom , withdrawing television rights , and similar humiliations . An emergency telephone service is provided twenty-four hours a day so that youngsters can report parental violations directly to an ombudsman . Following this incredible development , American psychologists took to the airways , advocating passage of a similar law in this country . The elimination of punishment is merely a small part of what the Los Angeles Times called " The Mounting March for Children 's Rights . " Accordingly , we can expect the other nine objectives to become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , where the Movement has found the most fertile ground , a prominent professor of law at Stockholm University has proposed that the Swedish constitution be amended to provide numerous rights to minors . One component that he hopes to include is the right of kids to " divorce " their parents . ( Since writing the statement above , Sweden has passed the proposed law . ) Of broader concern , the United Nations adopted a disturbing document in 1989 entitled " The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child . " While it contained many worthy provisions designed to protect the children of // the world from exploitation and deprivation , it also included seven articles that would undermine the authority of parents . Indeed , they conform entirely to the spirit of the Children 's Rights Movement . They are : ? Article 13 grants freedom of expression and the right to " seek , receive and impact information and ideas of all kinds . . . either orally , in writing or in print , in the form of art , or through any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance is made for possible parental restrictions based on family standards of decency . ? Article 14 guarantees children freedom of " thought , conscience and religion . " The parental role is only " to provide direction . " ? Article 15 prohibits any restrictions on a child 's freedom of association except as necessary for national security , public safety or order , public health or morals , or to protect the rights and freedoms of others . No parental right to oppose undesirable friendship is mentioned . ? Article 16 prohibits arbitrary interference with a child 's privacy , family , home , or correspondence . ? Article 17 entrusts to the mass media the responsibility for providing children with information and material for their " social , spiritual and moral well-being and physical and mental health . " The media also should protect them from " information and material injurious to his or her well-being . " ? Article 18 grants the children of all working parents " the right of benefit from child-care services and facilities . " ? Article 19 requires the state to legislate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care of their parents , guardians or others , in order to stamp out " all forms of physical or mental violence . " Observers are left wondering precisely what this means and how much farther such legislation might go. * // It does not require a public policy analyst to recognize the thrust of this United Nations Convention or its potential impact on parent leadership . Most significantly , the documentation functions like a treaty . In other words , it becomes legally binding on individuals living in countries which ratify it . So far , ratification has occurred in seventy-one nations , including France , Sweden , Spain , Australia , Germany , the Soviet Union , and even the Vatican . Canada reportedly stands on the verge of adoption as I write in 1991 . The United States has not officially considered ratification only because the president has not sent the convention to Congress for a vote . There is good reason to believe it will pass if that opportunity occurs . On September 11 , 1990 , the U.S. Senate formally asked President Bush to send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 , 1990 , the House passed a similar resolution . By the time you read this book , the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child could be the law of the land , superseding the U.S. Constitution and being legally binding on every citizen in this country . My point is that the Children 's Rights Movement is international in scope , and that it has scored significant victories in the past twenty years . Ultimately , its adherents wish to replace the ancient wisdom of the Judeo-Christian system of values with the humanistic notions of the twentieth century . We must not let them succeed . Parental authority and family stability simply must not be undermined if we are to raise healthy children and maintain the heritage handed to us by our forefathers . In a brilliant monograph entitled " Children 's Rights : The Ideological Road to Sweden , " Professor William Donahue expressed this concern : It is one of the great tragedies of our day that those who professionally claim to represent the best interest of children ... the self-described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem then resolve it . Specifically , // it is those children 's rights advocates who have pushed for positive rights ( as opposed to those who wish to stem child abuse ) that have done , and are continuing to do , great damage to the psychological well-being of children . Their motives may be benign , but that is of little consequence in the end . They think the number one problem facing children is the lack of freedom . Having made the wrong diagnoses , they double their mistake by holding a flawed definition of freedom . Strike three is their solution to the problem. * Donahue concludes , " If children were granted the same rights as adults , the very seat of parental authority would collapse . Absent that social base , all the individual attributes that freedom is predicated on would never develop . Society , and the liberty that inheres it , would self destruct " ( p. 5 ) . I should emphasize that I am not opposed to the many worthwhile organizations that are working to secure a better life for children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are being inflicted on helpless boys and girls across this country , and I certainly do not wish to discredit the efforts of those who seek to ameliorate their suffering . However , within this body of concerned individuals is a smaller constituency which I have described . They seek to impose a new way of life . . . a new parental ethic . . . on families everywhere . They have been remarkably successful in this effort during the past decade . The extreme element of the Children 's Rights Movement is now shifting its emphasis from a philosophical level to the courtroom . I received a letter from an attorney several years ago who sought my help in defending a father who was threatened with the loss of his child . The details are difficult to believe . It appears that the Department of Social Service in his community is attempting to remove a six-year-old girl from her home // because her father will not permit her to attend movies , listen to rock music or watch certain television programs . This child is well adjusted emotionally and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports that she ranks in the top five students in her class , academically . Nevertheless , the courts are being asked to remove her from her home because of the intolerable " abuse " she is experiencing there . Few matters make me angry during this tranquil phase of my life , but you 've just read one of them . When humanists are permitted to impose their naive idealism on the composition and functioning of the basic family unit , including yours and mine , then we are in serious trouble as a nation . In this instance , they are undermining the right of parents to instill moral values in their children , which is a responsibility ordained by God , Himself . I have written these words before , but feel compelled to repeat their beleageured message : authority is the glue that holds human organizations together , whether in a government , military , school , business . . . or home . Without leadership in human relationships , chaos soon reigns supreme . Three principles relative to authority are vitally important to the family , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me discuss them briefly : 1 . The primary responsibility for the provision of authority in the home has been assigned to men . It will not be popular to restate the age-old Biblical concept that God holds men accountable for leadership in their families . Nevertheless , that 's the way I interpret the Scriptures . 1 Timothy 3:4 ? 5 ( PHILLIPS ) states : He the father must have proper authority in his own household , and be able to control and command the respect of his children . Whether it seems out of date or not , a Christian man is obligated to lead his family to the best of his ability . This assignment // does not justify iron-fisted oppression of children or the disregard of a woman 's needs and wishes , of course . But God apparently expects a man to be the ultimate decision maker in his family . Likewise , he bears heavier responsibility for the outcome of those decisions . If his family has purchased too many items on credit , then the financial crunch is ultimately his fault . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church , God holds the man to blame . If the children are disrespectful and disobedient , the primary responsibility lies with the father . . . not his wife . ( I do n't remember Eli 's wife being criticized for raising two evil sons ; it was her husband who came under God 's wrath . See 1 Samuel 3:13 . ) From this perspective , what happens to a family when the designated leader does n't do his job ? Similar consequences can be seen in a corporation whose president only pretends to direct the company . The organization disintegrates very quickly . The parallel to leaderless families is too striking to be missed . In my view , America 's greatest need is for husbands to begin guiding their families , rather than pouring every physical and emotional resource into the mere acquisition of money . That belief motivated the book you are reading . 2 . Children naturally look to their fathers for authority . When my son Ryan was five years old , he overheard a reference to my childhood . " Daddy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , Ryan , I was smaller than you , " I replied . " Were you ever a baby ? " he inquired with disbelief . " Yes . Everyone is a tiny baby when he is born . " Ryan looked puzzled . He simply could not comprehend his 6-foot 2-inch , 190-pound father as an infant . He thought for a minute and then said , " Were you a daddy-baby ? " It was impossible for Ryan to imagine me without the mantle of authority , even if I were a tiny newborn . His nineyear-old sister reacted similarly the first time she was shown home movies of me when I was only four . There on the screen // was a baby-faced , innocent lad on a horse . Danae had to be assured that the picture was of me , whereupon she exclaimed , " That kid spanks me ? ! " Danae and Ryan both revealed their perception of me .. . not as a man who had been given authority . . . but as man who was authority . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look to their fathers , whose size and power and deeper voices bespeak leadership . That 's why , despite numerous exceptions , men teachers are likely to handle classroom discipline more easily than soft ladies with feminine voices . ( A woman teacher once told me that the struggle to control her class was like trying to keep thirty-two Ping-Pong balls under water at the same time . ) That is also why mothers need the disciplinary involvement of their husbands . Not that a man must handle every act of disobedience , but he should serve as the frame on which parental authority is constructed . Furthermore , it must be clear to the kids that Dad is in agreement with Mother 's policies and he will defend her in instances of insurrection . Referring to 1 Timothy again , this is what is meant by a father having the " proper authority in his own household . " 3 . Authority will be tested . Deeply ingrained in the human temperament is a selfwill that rejects external authority . This spirit of rebellion manifests itself during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " terrible twos " can be summarized by this barbed question , " By what right do you or anyone else try to tell me what to do with my life ! ? " That same question will be bellowed during the adolescent years , along with sweet little comments such as , " I did n't ask to be born , you know ! " Johnny Carson once said that if his teenager ever said that to him he 'd reply , " It 's a good thing you did n't ask . I 'd have said no . " My point is that human beings at all ages are inclined to test the limits of authority . At its most basic level , this resistance // is an expression of mankind 's spiritual rebellion against God . Anyone who doubts this stubborn nature need only observe the sheer power of a toddler 's self-will . Have you ever seen an angry three year old hold his breath until he becomes unconscious ? It happens . Consider the child whose mother wrote me the following note : My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child the night she was introduced to green peas . Julie took one bite and then refused to swallow . But she also refused to spit out the peas , no matter what we tried to do . We attempted to pry open her jaws , then threatened to spank her . Finally , we pleaded with Julie to cooperate , but she would n't budge . There was nothing left to do but put her to bed . Twelve hours later she awoke bright and cheery with no peas in her mouth . We found them in a little pile down at the foot of her bed . Her father and I were very relieved that those green peas did not remain in her mouth all night long ! Could it be that a two-year-old girl is actually capable of outmaneuvering and outlasting the adults in her world ? It certainly is . And if there is one blind spot in twentieth-century psychology , it is the failure to recognize this pugnacious human temperament and the importance of responding appropriately when willful defiance occurs . But what is the appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit a Certified Public Accountant , William Jarnagin , to answer that question . He wrote me the following letter which speaks volumes about parent-child relationships . Dear Dr. Dobson : This is a note of thanks for your work in strengthening the American family . My wife and I have recently read four of your books and we have profited very much from them . Please permit me to relate a recent experience with our sixyear-old son , David . Last Friday night , my wife , Becky , told him to pick up some orange peelings he had left on the carpet , which // he knows is a " no-no . " He failed to respond , and as a result received one slap on his behind , whereupon he began an obviously defiant temper tantrum . Since I had observed the whole episode , I then called for my paddle and applied it appropriately , saw to it that he picked up and properly disposed of the orange peelings , and sent him straight to bed , since it was already past his bedtime . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle down , I went to his room and explained that God had instructed all parents who truly love their children to properly discipline them , etc. , and that we truly love him and therefore would not permit such defiant behavior . The next morning , after I had gone to work , David presented his mother with the following letter , together with a little stack of ten pennies : From David and Deborah To Mom and Dad Ross Dr. 3d house Sellmer , Tennasse 39718 Dear Mom and Dad here is 10 Cints for Pattelling me when I really neded and that gos for Deborah to I love you Love yur son David and yur Doter Deborah Oh , incidentally , Deborah is our one-year-old daughter whose adoption should be final sometime in June . Keep up your good work and may God bless you . Sincerely , William H. Jarnagin // Mr. William Jarnagin understands the appropriate response of a father to a child 's defiance . It is neither harsh nor insulting nor dangerous nor whimsical . Rather , it represents the firm but loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . How fortunate is the boy or girl whose father still comprehends that timeless concept . Summary Men in Western nations have experienced a severe crisis of identity in recent years , similar to the confusion that their wives have encountered . It has been brought on by persistent challenges to everything traditionally masculine , just as the women 's movement has mocked traditionally female behavior and mores . Masculine leadership , especially , has been ridiculed as " macho " and invariably self-serving . But the purpose of this chapter has been to reaffirm the importance of authority in a family ? first , in the provision of gentle direction and guidance , and second , in raising healthy children . Both objectives appear to be part of the Creator 's blueprint for a successful home . 9 Questions Pertaining to Children We have dealt exclusively with the relationship between a man and his children to this point . Before turning to other aspects of masculine involvement , perhaps we should devote a remaining chapter to questions and answers relevant to boys and girls . This approach will permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions that might have been raised . Of special concern will be the matter of man 's " ultimate priority " ? winning children to Christ . We 'll begin with an issue that is especially troubling to Christian women , today . It is , in fact , a question that is often asked whenever I speak on the subject of fatherhood. 1 . I agree with your belief that the father should be the spiritual leader in the family , but it just does n't happen that way at our house . If the kids go to church on Sunday , it 's because I wake them up and see that they get ready . If we have family devotions , it 's done at my insistence , and I 'm the one who prays with the // children at bedtime . If I did n't do these things , our kids would have no spiritual training . Nevertheless , people keep saying that I should wait for my husband to accept spiritual leadership in our family . What do you advise in my situation ? That 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now . As you indicated , some Christian leaders instruct women to wait passively for their husbands to assume spiritual responsibility . Until that leadership is accepted , they recommend that wives stay out of the way and let God put pressure on the husband to assume the role that He 's given to men . I strongly disagree with that view when small children are involved . If the issue focused only on the spiritual welfare of a husband and wife , then a woman could afford to bide her time . However , the presence of boys and girls changes the picture dramatically . Every day that goes by without spiritual training for them is a day that can never be recaptured . Therefore , if your husband is not going to accept the role of spiritual leadership that God has given him , then I believe you must do it . You have no time to lose . You should continue taking the family to church on Sunday . You should pray with the children and teach them to read the Bible . Furthermore , you must continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In short , I feel that the spiritual life of children ( and adults ) is simply too important for a woman to postpone for two or four or six years , hoping her husband will eventually awaken . Jesus made it clear that members of our own family can erect the greatest barriers to our faith , but must not be permitted to do so . He says , " Do not think that I have come to bring peace on earth ; I have not come to bring peace , but a sword . For I have come to set a man against his father , and a daughter against her mother , and a daughter-inlaw against her mother-in-law ; and a man 's foes will be those of his own household . He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me ; and he who loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me " ( Matt. 10:34-38 , Rsv ) . // I mentioned my grandfather , R. L. Dobson , earlier in this book . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . His spiritual disinterest placed my grandmother , Juanita Dobson , under great pressure , for she was a devout Christian who felt she must put God first . Therefore , she accepted the responsibility of introducing her six children to Jesus Christ . There were times when my grandfather exerted tremendous pressure on her , not to give up her faith , but to leave him out of it . He said , " I am a good father and provider , I pay my bills , and I am honest in dealing with my fellow man . That is enough . " His wife replied , " You are a good man , but that is not enough . You should give your heart to God . " This he could not comprehend . My ninety-seven-pound grandmother made no attempt to force her faith on her husband , nor did she treat him disrespectfully . But she quietly continued to pray and fast for the man she loved . For more than forty years she brought this same petition before God on her knees . Then at sixty-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the first time in his life he was desperately ill . One day his young daughter came into his room to clean and straighten . As she walked by his bed , she saw tears in his eyes . No one had ever seen him cry before . " Daddy , what 's wrong ? " she asked . He responded , " Honey , go to the head of the stairs and call your mother . " My grandmother ran to her husband 's side and heard him say , " I know I 'm going to die and I 'm not afraid of death , but it 's so dark . There 's no way out . I 've lived my whole life through and missed the one thing that really matters . Will you pray for me ? " " Will I pray ? " exclaimed my grandmother . She had been hoping for that request throughout her adult life . She fell to her knees and the intercessions of forty years seemed to pour out through that bedside prayer . R. L. Dobson gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // During the next two weeks , he asked to see some of the church people whom he had offended and requested their forgiveness . He concluded his personal affairs and then died with a testimony on his lips . Before descending into a coma from which he would never awaken , my grandfather said , " ... Now there is a way through the darkness . " The unrelenting prayers of my little grandmother had been answered . Returning to the question , I would like to caution women not to become " self-righteous " and critical of their husbands . Let everything be done in a spirit of love . However , there may be some lonely years when the burden of spiritual leadership with children must be carried alone . If that is the case , the Lord has promised to walk with you through these difficult days . 2 . Parents have been commanded in the Bible to " train up a child in the way he should go . " But this poses a critical question : What way should he go ? If the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training , what should be taught during this period ? What experiences should be included ? What values should be emphasized ? It is my strong belief that a child should be exposed to a carefully conceived , systematic program of religious training . Yet we are much too haphazard about this matter . Perhaps we would hit the mark more often if we more clearly recognized the precise target . Listed below is a " Checklist for Spiritual Training " ? a set of targets at which to aim . Many of the items require maturity which children lack , and we should not try to make adult Christians out of our immature youngsters . But we can gently urge them toward these goals ? these targets ? during the impressionable years of childhood . Essentially , the five scriptural concepts which follow should be consciously taught , providing the foundation on which all future doctrine and faith will rest . I encourage every Christian parent to evaluate his child 's understanding of these five areas : // CONCEPT I : " And thou shalt love the Lord thy God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . 1 . Is your child learning of the love of God through the love , tenderness , and mercy of his parents ? ( most im-portant ) 2 . Is he learning to talk about the Lord , and to include Him in his thoughts and plans ? 3 . Is he learning to turn to Jesus for help whenever he is frightened or anxious or lonely ? 4 . Is he learning to read the Bible ? 5 . Is he learning to pray ? 6 . Is he learning the meaning of faith and trust ? 7 . Is he learning the joy of the Christian way of life ? 8 . Is he learning the beauty of Jesus ' birth and death ? CONCEPT II : " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself " ( Mark 12:31 , KJV ) . 1 . Is he learning to understand and empathize with the feelings of others ? 2 . Is he learning not to be selfish and demanding ? 3 . Is he learning to share ? 4 . Is he learning not to gossip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself ? CONCEPT III : " Teach me to do thy will ; for thou art my God " ( Ps. 143:10 , KJV ) . 1 . Is he learning to obey his parents as preparation for later obedience to God ? ( most important ) 2 . Is he learning to behave properly in church ? God 's house ? 3 .

Send me ! " 3 . It is very difficult for us to have meaningful devotions as a family because our young children seem so bored and uninvolved . They yawn and squirm and giggle while we are reading the Bible . On the other hand , we feel it is important to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you help us deal with this dilemma ? The one key word to family devotions is brevity . Children ca n't be expected to comprehend and appreciate lengthy adult spiritual activities . Four or five minutes devoted to one or two Bible verses , followed by a short prayer , usually represents the limits of attention during the preschool years . To force // young children to comprehend eternal truths in an eternal devotional can be eternally dangerous . 4 . My wife and I are new Christians , and we now realize that we raised our kids by the wrong principles . They 're grown now , but we continue to worry about the past , and we feel great regret for our failures as parents . Is there anything we can do at this late date ? Let me deal , first , with the awful guilt you are obviously carrying . There 's hardly a parent alive who does not have some regrets and painful memories of their failures as a mother or a father . Children are infinitely complex , and we can not be perfect parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pressures of living are often enormous , and we get tired and irritated ; we are influenced by our physical bodies and our emotions , which sometimes prevent us from saying the right things and being the model we should . We do n't always handle our children as unemotionally as we wish we had , and it 's very common to look back a year or two later and see how wrong we were in the way we approached the problem . All of us experience these failures ! No one does the job perfectly ! That 's why each of us should get alone with the Creator of parents and children , saying , " Lord , you know my inadequacies . You know my weaknesses , not only in parenting , but in every area of my life . I did the best I could , but it was n't good enough . As You broke the fishes and the loaves to feed the five thousand , now take my meager effort and use it to bless my family . Make up for the things I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wrap Your great arms around my children , and draw them close to You . And be there when they stand at the great crossroads between right and wrong . All I can give is my best , and I 've done that . Therefore , I submit to You my children and my self and the job I did as a parent . The outcome now belongs to You . " // I know God will honor that prayer , even for parents whose job is finished . The Lord does not want you to suffer from guilt over events you can no longer influence . The past is the past . Let it die never to be resurrected . Give the situation to God , and let Him have it . I think you 'll be surprised to learn that you 're no longer alone ! 5 . My wife and I are extremely busy during this period of our lives . My job takes me on the road several days a week , and my wife has become very successful as a real estate agent . Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our three children , but we give them our undivided attention when we are together . My wife and I wish we had more family time , but we take comfort in knowing that it 's not the quantity of time between parents and child that really matters ; it 's the quality of time that makes the difference . Would you agree with that statement ? Permit me to respond to your question by a back-door approach which may seem irrelevant , at first . As a person who earns part of his living by use of the King 's English , I often find myself examining the validity of folk wisdom and cliches which have been accepted prima facie within our culture . While discussing the legal ramifications of pornography with a friend , for example , he confidently uttered that familiar phrase , " Well , you ca n't legislate morality , you know . " I nodded in agreement , but later asked myself , " Why not ? " It is immoral to kill , rape , slander , defraud , and plunder , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we ? Is not all criminal law based on the prohibition of certain inherently evil acts ? Indeed , we would be in a mess if our lawmakers truly believed , " You ca n't legislate morality , you know . " Returning to the question of quantity versus quality in parent-child relationships , we confront yet another widely quoted cliche that is equally porous . Without intending disrespect for the father who asked the above question , this phrase is bandied about by overcommitted and harassed // parents who feel guilty about the lack of time they spend with their children . Their boys and girls are parked at child care centers during the day and with baby-sitters at night , leaving little time for traditional parenting activities . And to handle the discomfort of neglecting their children , Mom and Dad cling to a catchphrase that makes it seem so healthy and proper : " Well , you know , it 's not the quantity of time that matters , it 's the quality of your togetherness that counts . " There is a grain of truth in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can all agree that there is no benefit in being with our children seven days a week if we are angry , oppressive , unnurturing and capricious with them . But from that point forward , the quantity versus quality issue runs aground . Simply stated , that dichotomy will not be tolerated in any other area of our lives ; why do we apply it only to children ? Let me illustrate . Let 's suppose you are very hungry , having eaten nothing all day . You select the best restaurant in your city and ask the waiter for the finest steak on his menu . He replies that the filet mignon is the house favorite , and you order it charcoal-broiled , medium rare . The waiter returns twenty minutes later with the fare and sets it before you . There in the center of a large plate is a lonely piece of meat , one inch square , flanked by a single bit of potato . You complain vigorously to the waiter . " Is this what you call a steak dinner ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us before you taste that meat ? I have brought you one square inch of the finest steak money can buy . It is cooked to perfection , salted with care , and served while hot . In fact , I doubt if you could get a better piece of meat anywhere in the city . I 'll admit that the serving is small , but after all , sir , everyone knows that it is n't the quantity that matters ; it 's the quality that counts in steak dinners . " " Nonsense ! " you reply , and I certainly agree . You see , the subtlety of this simple phrase is that it pits two necessary virtues in opposition to one another and invites us to choose // between them . If quantity and quality are worthwhile ingredients in family relationships , then why not give our kids both ? It is insufficient to toss our " hungry " children an occasional bite of steak , even it if is prime , corn-fed filet mignon . My concern is that the quantity versus quality cliche has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 6 . I want to ask you a very personal question . Your books deal with practical aspects of everyday living . They offer solutions and suggestions for handling the typical frustrations and problems of parenthood and marriage . But that makes me wonder about your own family . Does your home always run smoothly ? Do you ever feel like a failure as a father ? And if so , how do you deal with self-doubt and recrimination ? I have been asked this question many times , although the answer should surprise no one . Shirley and I experience the same frustrations and pressures that others face . Our behavior is not always exemplary , nor is that of our children . And our household can become very hectic at times . Perhaps I can best illustrate my reply by describing the day we now refer to as " Black Sunday . " For some reason , the Sabbath can be the most frustrating day of the week for us , especially during the morning hours . I 've found that other parents also experience tensions during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Black Sunday was especially chaotic . We began that day by getting up too late , meaning everyone had to rush to get to church on time . That produced emotional pressure , especially for Shirley and me . Then there was the matter of the spilt milk at breakfast , and the black shoe polish on the floor . And , of course , Ryan got dressed first , enabling him to slip out the back door and get himself dirty from head to toe . It was necessary to take him down to the skin and start over with clean clothes once more . Instead of handling these irritants as they arose , we began criticizing one another and hurling accusations back and forth . At least one spanking was delivered , as I recall , and another three or four // were promised . Yes , it was a day to be remembered ( or forgotten ) . Finally , four harried people managed to stumble into church , ready for a great spiritual blessing , no doubt . There 's not a pastor in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt guilty throughout the day for the strident tone of our home on that Black Sunday . Sure , our children shared the blame , but they were merely responding to our disorganization . Shirley and I had overslept , and that 's where the conflict originated . After the evening service , I called the family together around the kitchen table . I began by describing the kind of day we had had , and asked each person to forgive me for my part in it . Furthermore , I said that I thought we should give each member of the family an opportunity to say whatever he or she was feeling inside . Ryan was given the first shot , and he fired it at his mother . " You 've been a real grouch today , Mom ! " he said with feeling . " You 've blamed me for everything I 've done all day long . " Shirley then explained why she had been unhappy with her son , trying not to be defensive about his charges . Danae then poured out her hostilities and frustrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain the tensions that had caused our overreaction . It was valuable time of ventilation and honesty that drew us together once more . We then had prayer as a family and asked the Lord to help us live and work together in love and harmony . My point is that every family has moments when they violate all the rules ? even departing from the Christian principles by which they have lived . Fatigue itself can damage all the high ideals which have been recommended to parents in seminars and books and sermons . The important question is , how do mothers and fathers reestablish friendship within their families when the storm has passed ? Open , nonthreatening discussion offers one solution to that situation . // Returning to the question , let 's acknowledge that a psychologist can no more prevent all emotional distress for his family than a physician can circumvent disease in his . We live in an imperfect world which inflicts struggles on us all . Nevertheless , Biblical principles offer the most healthy approach to family living ? even turning stress to our advantage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 . You 've indicated that seven deaths have occurred in your family during an eighteen-month period . We have also had several tragic losses in our family in recent years . My wife died when our children were five , eight , and nine . I found it very difficult to explain death to them during that time . Can you offer some guidelines regarding how a parent can help his children cope with the stark reality of death ? especially when it strikes within the immediate family ? Some years ago , I attended a funeral at the Inglewood Cemetery-Mortuary in Inglewood , California . While there , I picked up a brochure written by the president of the mortuary , John M. McKinley . Mr. McKinley had been in the funeral business for fifteen years before writing this valuable pamphlet entitled " If It Happens to Your Child . " He gave me permission to reproduce the content here in answer to your question . I knew Tommy 's parents because they lived in the neighborhood and attended the same church . But I knew Tommy especially well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had ever been my pleasure to meet . It was a shock , therefore , when his mother became a client of mine at the death of her husband . As a doctor must learn to protect himself from the suffering of his patients , so a funeral director must protect himself from grief . During the course of the average year I come in direct contact with several thousand men and women who have experienced a shattering loss , and if I did // not isolate myself from their emotions , my job would be impossible . But I have not been able to isolate myself from the children . " I do n't know what I would have done if I had not had Tommy , " his mother told me when I visited her in her home the morning she called me . " He has been such a little man ? has n't cried , and is doing everything he can to take his daddy 's place . " And it was true . Tommy was standing just as he imagined a man would stand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daddy 's place . I knew it was wrong . I knew I should tell her so ? that Tommy was not a man ; that he needed to cry ; that he needed comfort probably far more than she . But I am not a psychologist , and I said nothing . In the two years since then I have watched Tommy . The joy has not come back in his face , and it is clear even to my layman 's mind that he is an emotionally sick child . I am sure it began when his mother , unknowingly , made it difficult ? impossible ? for him to express his grief , and placed on him an obligation he could not fulfill ; that of " taking daddy 's place . " There have been few examples so clear cut as Tommy 's , but I have seen so much that made me wince , and I have been asked so often : " What should I tell Mary ? " or Paul , or Jim , that I finally decided to do something about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how a child should be treated at such moments of tragedy , and I asked them to lay down some guidelines that parents could understand and follow . I talked to several psychologists and psychiatrists and pediatricians , but principally to Dr. A. I. Duvall , a psychiatrist , and Dr. James Gardner , a child psychologist . Translated into my layman 's language , here is the gist of what I learned : ? When a child , like any other human being , experiences a deeply painful loss , not only should he be permitted to cry ; he should be encouraged to cry until the need for tears is gone . He should be comforted while the tears are
