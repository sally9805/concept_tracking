The Apollo Theatre , Harlem , New York : Amid all the preproduction hubbub that turns this entertainment landmark into a glitzy TV-show venue , Regina Belle stands and waits , a calm port in a storm of activity . Here to host an episode of It 's Showtime at the Apollo , she waits for the director to give her cue-card lines , tapping her foot to some beat only she hears . Seconds later , her three backup singers take their places on a low-riser upstage left , and the booming track begins . The song is " Dream in Color , " a sensually spirited ballad from Passion , her third and most recent album . Belle and her singers are dressed down in rehearsal-gear style : jeans , sweaters , caps . It 's apparent just how comfortable she is when I went out there , " Belle recalls at her home in suburban Cleveland . " I thought , Why do I have to be some kind of beauty makeup queen ? Besides , that makeup messes up your skin . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits for our interview on her Pepto-Bismol-pink sectional couch ( the result of a botched order ) , she exudes the kind of confidence and intelligence that comes from finding inner peace after a time of much personal turmoil . Smaller in person than she appears onstage and athletic in build , Regina , wearing an oversize white oxford and snug white shorts , glances around her home , toward the playroom where her daughter , Tiy , and son , Jayln , occupy themselves with assorted toys and playmates . Thanks to her new album ( her first in three years ) and all the attendant clutter of photo shoots , interviews and live shows , it 's been a time of serious schedule readjustments for her and her husband , John Battle , a guard on the Cleveland Cavaliers . But having both a million-plus records sold and a loyal following , Belle is learning to rest more and to enjoy the fruits of her success , materitearing this song up in street clothes . No star stuff . Just the singer , the music and the song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this busy , rushed Apollo audience of stagehands , producers and hangers-on , the activity stops , the makeshift crowd halts . This is a star , they can clearly see , with or without makeup . It 's this kind of naturalness with which this songstress instantly enamored folks when her debut album , All by Myself , hit the radio airwaves . But the 30-year-old singer seems to be riding an even bigger wave of professional glory right now . Passion  --  which features her number-one pop hit , " A Whole New World , " the Academy Award-winning theme song from the Disney film Aladdin , plus the number-one R &; B hit " If I Could "  --  is a smash . Belle has always been a natural performer . But she really learned how to work a crowd in the mid-eighties , during her two-year stint as a featured singer with The Manhattans . Even though group member Winfred Blue Lovett eventually got her to wear makeup and sequined outfits , she was far more focused on perfecting her stage presentation . During that period she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be real beneath all the colored lights and high-toned hairstyles . " I thought it was important that I give 110 percent ally and emotionally , which means making more time for Regina . " My list of priorities goes from God to family , then to my music  --  in that order , " she says . " I think the one blessing that I 've had is that my life is not dependent on fame and fortune . My life revolves around family . That 's the most important thing to me . " In fact , it 's her family that Regina Belle turns to when she finds herself faced with the sometimes painful personal events of her life offstage . Belle has suffered three miscarriages over the last five years , the most recent one shortly after her Apollo appearance . Although the depression still lingers , she remains strong . " I 'm a soldier , a fighter , and I 'm not a quitter , " she says . " I 'm definitely my mother 's child . She spent many years trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I realize that it 's really God 's plan when it 's meant to be . " Through it all , her parents have been supportive . " I was crying so much after my last miscarriage that my mother came and took the kids for a while daughter Tiy , 3 , and son Jayln , 18 months , are both adopted . She told me that I 'd smother them with the love for the child I lost . But I 've started repairing myself . I 'm planning work for the rest of the year . You know , keep busy . Then we 'll try again in the near future . " She 's also educating herself about the reproductive process , to better understand what she 's been through . " Sometimes I think it 's the environment or the water . I 've spoken to numerous specialists and read lots of books on the subject . The ratio of infertility is as high as one in six couples . That 's amazing ! It 's easy to get depressed . But I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be no surrogate parents here , " she adds , making a joke , perhaps to ease the pain . " No Baby M in this house . We 'll keep fighting . " It was during her formative years in Englewood , New Jersey , that Belle developed her commitments to family and music . In high school she frequently sang with bands and in church , consistently winning pageants and talent contests . ( She sang mostly gospel then and was dubbed the " next Shirley Caesar . " ) At her parents " insistence , after high school Belle went straight to Rutgers  --  The State University in New Brunswick , New Jersey . " I was the eldest . So all the expectations and ambitions were placed on me . There was no question about college . " Academics came first at Rutgers . ( In fact , her father put it to her rather bluntly : " Girl , you can already sing . What you wan na study music for ? " ) She embarked on a business and economics major and sang in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economics were n't exactly her strong points . Belle thrived in Black-history courses , however . " Learning my history was the beginning of Regina Belle  --  knowing who she is and where she fits in life , " she explains . " As a child , I hated it when people called my father Black because he was darker than my mother . And I got mad when people said I looked just like my father . I would go off . " Learning her history changed all that . " Now I get on everybody 's nerves . I do n't wan na hear nothin ' " bout good hair or bad hair . " She grabs her pulled-back coif . " Good hair is what you got right here . Bad hair is when you ca n't grow none . " She laughs , but one can tell this sister is serious . " I 'm like that with my kids too . I do n't want that kind of stuff being said around them . You do n't want to be a nag , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical transformation at Rutgers . She added secular music to her repertoire and fell in love with jazz . " I did n't really like jazz until some of my college musician friends said , " Look , you got ta learn two songs a day , ' ' " she remembers . Music became her unofficial minor , and she started " taking jazz courses . " I wanted to sing it , but I also felt I had to know its history  --  how a lot of the white boys had gotten credit for stuff . I think it was Frederick Douglass who said , " Once I learned to read , I was no longer a slave . ' ' " She even did a thesis on the music , drawing parallels between African-American culture and the development of spirituals , slave chants and the blues . Today when Regina Belle sings , she 's like a historian . In her phrasings one can hear the struggles of generations of Black singers who used the sheer , powerful force of vocal stylings to tell their stories . Compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of character . She does n't have the biggest voice or hold the longest notes , but her sound really resonates in a room . It calls up the spirits of black musicianship . And when Regina gets the spirit , the spirit gets you . Or , as she puts it , " people believe me . " It was this vocal power that led New York City radio personality Vaughn Harper of WBLS-FM to introduce Regina to The Manhattans . She auditioned for three days straight before they finally said yes . Their former lead singer , Gerald Alston , remembers why they gave her the gig : " The other girls just wanted to look cute . Regina was n't scared to make her face ugly to get the notes out . " Booked to go on the road for a week , she ended up spending a month with the band . She still had 12 credits to go toward her college degree , but she decided to drop out . She had found her calling . And the sister simply had to sing . She toured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal with Columbia Records . All by Myself was greeted with overwhelming acclaim . Initially there were frequent comparisons to Anita Baker and Whitney Houston . But as people took notice of her somewhat melancholy performance on her second single , " So Many Tears , " Regina Belle found herself instead being compared to the legendary Lady Day . Belle bought her first Billie Holiday record during her senior year in high school . Today she considers Holiday a musical mentor . " I always thought she was the total epitome of femininity , " she says . " Her voice was smooth , silky , sensual , seductive ... " Suddenly she stops her eulogy . She thinks for a moment , then continues . " Billie Holiday died on my birthday . I do n't want people to think that I want to be Billie Holiday . But through my music , I can keep her alive  --  through zamani . As long as you can remember a person and escalate that memory , that person lives . That 's called zamani in Swahili . " Belle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a musician , lasted three and a half years . " We did n't gel , " she says , explaining that too much time spent apart and her rising career contributed to the breakup . " We both had things to do , but we were n't doing them well together . " Coupled with the marital problems , Belle also suffered her first miscarriage . " I was so depressed after I lost that baby . I could n't even go to work . But we decided to adopt . " She was blessed with Tiy , the beautiful , energetic daughter who appears now as if on cue , offering her mommy candy . " After divorcing , I did n't even want to think about getting married again . I just wanted to take care of my child . At first I was scared . I mean , this child was mine . I felt a little helpless , but eventually I started living with that . " Finally clearheaded , she recorded her highly emotional second album , Stay With Me . One of its highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children " and Donny Hathaway 's " Someday We 'll Be Free . " Belle 's dramatic rendering of these two soul classics is positively inspirational , full of the hope in the songs ' messages . She sounds happy . Which is kind of how she sounds when she talks about John Battle , her second husband of two years , with whom she adopted Jayln , Tiy 's natural brother , and for whom she left her hometown to make a life in the Cleveland suburbs . " John and I went to Rutgers together , " she recalls . " I 'd go watch him play . He 'd come hear me sing when he was in town . We were best friends . " But one day they had a meal together , and stronger feelings appeared out of nowhere . " I waited until I was out of town to call him and tell him what I was feeling . And you know what he said ? " I 'll get back to you . " My face just fell off . I was like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail my eyes ? " she says now , laughing . When Battle finally touched base , a long six months later , he confessed he 'd had his fair share of dating . He was ready to get serious . He told her , " I 'm looking for a wife  --  not a tourist . " Says Belle , " I think he wanted somebody safe , somebody who would quit her nine-to-five and let him support her  --  all the storybook crap . But here I come . I can make as much money as he , if not more , if not for longer . I have as many fans ... " She breaks off , laughing at the memory of that conversation . " But it 's good . We 're resolving it . Besides , John knows how I feel about family and would n't do anything to disrupt what we have here . And I intend to continue my career as I try again to have a child . " Belle also intends to make this union last forever . This time around , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence , " as her manager described her before her first marriage . She 's more settled , more concerned about family , and adjusting well to the changes of her life as she starts a new round of tours to support her latest album . Entitled Passion , it sums up a lot of who Regina Belle is : funny , playful , serious and full of feeling . But let her tell it , and it 's not even by her . Or about her . " It 's about Ginger , " she says , laughing . " That 's my alias . I do n't know where she comes from , but I know when she 's here . She 's fresh , she 's kind of a tease . But she 's not fatal , she 's not trying to hurt anybody . She likes to play games . Ginger has grown over the years , though , thanks to time and experience . She 's gotten older and wiser . " Regina Belle pauses for a moment , looking away as if struck by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't grow old being a fool . ' ' " And mothers always know best .
