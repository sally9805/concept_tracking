Section : FUND WATCH News and performance <p> If income exempt from federal taxes is good , then income free from both the feds and the state must be great . Right ? <p> Well , not necessarily . But you 'd never guess that from the recent buying behavior of mutual fund investors . In the first quarter of this year , tax-wary investors shoveled more than $2.2 billion into single-state municipal bond funds , $700 million more than went into the next hottest category , national muni funds . Because the funds invest in munis issued within a single state , the income they produce is generally free of federal , state and local taxes for the state 's residents . ( Income from multistate , or national , tax-free funds is exempt from federal tax only . ) The problem with single-state funds , however , is that their tax advantages can sometimes cause you to lose sight of your financial goals . " You should n't just try to reduce your tax bite , " says Harold Evensky , a financial planner in Coral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maximizing your after-tax return . " And in these recession-whipped times , single-state funds are n't always the best way to do so . <p> One reason is that the risks of single-state fund investing are arguably higher than ever . Since a single-state fund lacks the geographic diversification of a national muni fund , fiscal troubles at the statehouse or other tax-exempt authorities can weigh heavily on returns . Funds in deficit-plagued Massachusetts , for example , returned just 37% over the past five years , compared with 43% for national muni funds . The risk is n't limited to the sickly Northeast either . More than $6.6 billion of bonds issued in states ranging from Colorado to Georgia were downgraded by the rating agency Standard &; Poor 's in the first quarter of this year , and analysts warn that California could be next . <p> Still , if your combined federal , state and local tax rate is 35% or more , a single-state muni bond fund may be right for you . But keep the following advice in mind : <p> Be extremely picky about your fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only in portfolios insured against default by leading municipal bond insurers , such as MBIA and AMBAC . ( Most such funds have the word insured in their name . ) The cost of insurance typically slices a quarter of a percentage point or so off a fund 's yield , but in today 's market the extra credit protection can pay for itself . In the three years to May 1 , insured single-state funds outgained their uninsured cousins 30% to 28% , despite their lower yields . <p> Unfortunately , only California , New York and Pennsylvania investors can buy insured funds without paying sales charges of as much as 5% . If you refuse to pay a load for an insured fired , stick with no-load funds that keep at least 85% of their assets in bonds rated A or better by Standard &; Poor 's . <p> Make sure you 're really getting a tax break . Before the state and local tax break is taken into account , single-state funds generally yield slightly less than comparable national funds . So , to compare the two fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground called a taxable-equivalent yield . ( To make the calculation , see the box on page 50 . ) Muni bond experts say that a high-grade noninsured single-state fund should have a taxable-equivalent yield at least 1.5 percentage points higher than a national muni fund . Otherwise , the state fund is n't worth the extra risk brought on by its relative lack of diversification . For an insured fund , a premium of 0.25 to 0.50 points will do . <p> Consider alternatives . If you 're a confirmed buy-and-hold investor , the best single-state investment may not be a mutual fund at all but the close relative known as a unit investment trust . Instead of being actively managed like a fund , a unit trust holds a fixed portfolio of 12 to 15 bonds until they mature . Though most trusts are sold through brokerages  --  and thus charge an up-front sales fee of about 4.75%  --  over seven years or so the trust 's minuscule annual expenses of about 0.2% , compared with 0.75% for the average mutual fund , offset the load . Trusts work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than reinvesting , says Christine Carter Lynch , managing editor of Lynch Municipal Bond Advisor ( $250 a year ; 505-984-9199 ) . " Like a bond , " says Lynch , " a trust provides you with a predictable stream of income and returns your principal when it matures . " <p> Diversify . Use the rest of your portfolio to make up for the diversification that your single-state fund ( or trust ) lacks . Joel Vernick , a muni bond portfolio manager at David L. Babson &; Co. , an investment advisory firm in Cambridge , Mass. , recommends keeping no more than a third of your bond investments in single-state funds , with the remainder split between national muni and U.S. Treasury funds . " Especially in this market , " says Vernick , " you would be foolish to put all your eggs in one portfolio of statewide munis . " Monthly results at a glance <p> Bonds funds blossomed in April , while stock funds wilted .

Small-stock funds remained the hot choice among equity investors . <p> By Derek T. Dingle <p> FIGURING YOUR TAX-FREE ADVANTAGE <p> To compare national and single-state muni funds with one another and with taxable funds , you need to convert the tax-free yields to their taxable equivalents . Here 's how : <p> For a national muni fund , divide the current yield by 0.72 if you 're in the 28% tax bracket and 0.69 if you 're taxed at a 31% rate . <p> For single-state funds , first multiply your state and local tax rate by 0.72 or 0.69 , depending on your federal bracket . Then add the result to your federal tax rate to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fund 's yield by 1 minus your combined rate , expressed as a decimal . <p> For example , suppose a California couple with a joint income of $85,000 are choosing between a national fund yielding 6.6% and an insured state fund paying 6.4% . At that level of income , their federal bracket is 31% , their state rate is 9.3% and the combined rate is 37.4% . Thus the taxable equivalent yield from the national fund is 9.6% ( 6.6% divided by 0.69 ) . From the state muni fund it 's 10.2% ( 6.4% divided by 1 minus 0.374 ) . For this couple , then , the single-state fund would be the better buy . <p> By Derek T. Dingle <p>
