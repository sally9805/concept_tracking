! IN A FILM STUDIO IN ATLANTA , AMY Ray and Emily Saliers , who make up the folk- rock duo Indigo Girls , stand before a row of skeletons illuminated by flashes of light . The two are shooting a video of their new song Least Complicated ; in another scene Saliers lies on her back wearing a white wedding dress and clutching a bouquet of red flowers . What does it all mean ? Saliers , who wrote the song , offers a profound interpretation . " It 's about repeating patterns in life , " she says , " if you wanted to get the basic philosophic message . The video is an illustration of that . " Ray 's response is a bit less deep . " Well , " she says , " to me it really does n't have a meaning . " <P> The exchange is typical of these two partners , who in many ways are opposites . Ray is tough and outspoken and has a growling , devilish singing voice . Saliers is quiet and reflective , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced by punk bands like the Sex Pistols ; Saliers prefers Joni Mitchell . The two never write songs together , and for weeks at a time they drift apart to their separate circle of friends . But something connects them . The children of professional parents , both are 30 , Atlanta natives and graduates of Emory University . They have known each other for 20 years , played together for 12 and put out five studio albums since 1989 . Ray explains their alchemy in unromantic terms : " Me solo is too much of me , " she says . " Emily solo is too much of Emily . " <P> The just released CD Swamp Ophelia is Indigo Girls ' most complex and satisfying album . They started off performing at coffeehouses and on street corners , and their early songs were naked and direct  --  just the two of them playing guitar and singing folk music . Swamp Ophelia is more ambitious , with waves of orchestration , African drums , accordions and trumpets ; Saliers even plays a long electric-guitar solo . " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Ray . " There are more extremes going on . Electric and acoustic . Loud sounds and soft sounds . " <P> Some fans may miss the simplicity of the pair 's earlier recordings . But their new , more elaborate songs still have fire , grace and melodies that leap out at the listener . Once again , they sing beautifully braided harmonies with the occasional hint of dissonance , and their lyrics as usual have an eloquent , freewheeling wordiness . " I 'm just a mirror of a mirror of myself , " Saliers declares on Least Complicated . On This Train Revised , Ray reshapes the classic song This Train into a forceful , impressionistic account of her visit to Washington 's U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum : " Piss and blood in a railroad car/ 100 people gypsies queers and David 's star . " <P> Indigo Girls are n't made-for-video babes . They are not about belly buttons or cleavage or appearing on the Late Show with David Letterman chewing cigars and swearing to get attention , as Madonna did in April . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ album went platinum  --  both Girls harbor acid feelings about the image-conscious video age . " MTV has hurt music in one sense because people now judge a song by more than just the song , " says Ray . But , she concedes , " in the sense of having another art form around  --  video  --  MTV is probably a good thing . If only they would be more responsible and not just play the same videos over and over again . "
