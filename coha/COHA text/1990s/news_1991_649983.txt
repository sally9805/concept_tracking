##@x <p> When Beijing 's hardliners look to Moscow , they face their worst nightmare . The crumbling of the party and purging of the police and army , the ascendancy of Yeltsins , the flowering of freedom , the splintering of empire , and ethnic tensions along the northern border can only be hellish to those who cling to power by silencing and shooting citizens . <p> Will this mean resurgent demonstrations ? The demise of the Government ? The collapse of Communism ? While only a fool would hazard firm predictions , it is likely that the impact of Soviet events on China , though huge , will take time to emerge . Certainly , progressives are greatly heartened , and even more officials will adjust to the prevailing winds . But the paranoid autocrats will continue to crush the slightest dissent , and leading reformers will remain in jail , limbo or exile . <p> Though economic problems are severe , the reforms of the 1980 's have yielded a better life for many Chinese . And while serious tensions infect the Tibetan , Muslim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Han ; the center has a better chance of holding than did the Kremlin . <p> Thus , dramatic change may wait until Deng Xiaoping leaves the stage , when intense scrambling at the top doubtless will ensue . But bitterness over the Tiananmen massacre and the ongoing crackdown , resentment over corruption , the need for openness and information for development , yearnings for liberty , the linkage between political and economic reform , and the contagion of global trends should produce an early breakthrough toward freedom . <p> While no one knows when Communism will implode in China , we glimpsed the future in June 1989 , when millions of Chinese inspired Eastern Europeans and others around the globe . <p> There are major differences between the China spring and the Soviet summer . The crowds in Beijing were five to 10 times larger than those in Moscow or St. Petersburg ; demonstrations broke out in 200 to 300 Chinese cities compared to perhaps a dozen in the Soviet Union . The Chinese demonstrators petitioned modestly to reform the system , not end it , as did protesters in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked a charismatic leader like Boris Yeltsin , and China 's rulers were ruthless while the Soviet putschists were inept . <p> Then there is the glaring contrast in the Bush Administration 's positions . After initial hedging , the President strongly sided with Soviet freedom fighters . <p> Three weeks after the Beijing massacre , he dispatched his national security adviser , Brent Scowcroft , to confer with the perpetrators secretly . A few months later , in the wake of executions , jailings and persecution , Mr. Scowcroft returned to China to toast them publicly . <p> Ever since , the Administration has followed a consistent pattern : vetoing Congressional acts pressuring China , relaxing selective sanctions , welcoming the Foreign Minister in the Oval Office , strongly supporting democracy and human rights in the Soviet Union , Eastern Europe , Latin America and Africa  --  but not in China . <p> The Administration 's basic defense is that the U.S. can not afford to " isolate " that nation . That argument is a straw man . China is indeed important , with the world 's largest population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations Security Council , a potentially huge market and a rich civilization . It launches satellites and sells missiles . It is salient on regional issues like Indochina and Korea and global challenges like the environment and drugs . <p> Thus , no serious analyst seeks to quarantine China . By defying historical currents sweeping the world , Beijing isolates itself . <p> But our options are not confined to shunning or absolving China . The U.S. can conduct requisite business and honor its ideals . The U.S. should fortify reformers while dealing soberly with the Government ; we should sharply condemn repression and preserve links with progressive forces . We should maintain a dialogue with Beijing at the working level and in international forums , not with photo opportunities that legitimize the regime . We should continue sanctions in military cooperation , technology transfers and international loans . We should elevate Hong Kong on our agenda , stressing our stake in its political and economic freedom . <p> We should extend most-favored-nation trading status for one year , with realistic humanitarian conditions , while vigorously pursuing economic and military issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on China 's commercial and investment policies . Private academic , cultural and scientific ties should be safeguarded whenever productive . <p> Above all , let us drop the double standard . It is wrong . Chinese share the dreams of peoples everywhere . <p> In this way , we can project our values and promote our interests , for a freer China would enhance our relations and erase a bitter issue in our national debate . Reflecting popular will , China would be a more responsible global partner . Reducing commercial barriers , it would be a more expansive economic partner . Respecting human rights , it would be a more congenial political partner . <p> The Chinese will shape their own destiny . But the Havels , Walesas and Sakharovs have testified that international voices lend succor to those struggling in the dark . <p> In August , President Bush declared that Americans " stand behind the people of the Soviet Union . " Let us hope he will now stand behind the Chinese people . @@649983 Have mercy ! Lord , have mercy on my poor soul ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caves and out-of-the-way places that humans did n't usually use for birthplaces . Moses had n't come yet , and these were the years when Israel first made tears . Pharaoh had entered the bedrooms of Israel . The birthing beds of Hebrews were matters of state . The Hebrew womb had fallen under the heel of Pharaoh . A ruler great in his newness and new in his greatness had arisen in Egypt and he had said , " This is law . Hebrew boys shall not be born . All offenders against this law shall suffer death by drowning . " <p> So women in the pains of labor hid in caves and rocks . They must cry , but they could not cry out loud . They pressed their teeth together . A night might force upon them a thousand years of feelings . Men learned to beat upon their breasts with clenched fists and breathe out their agony without sound . A great force of suffering accumulated between the basement of heaven and the roof of hell . The shadow of Pharaoh squatted in the dark corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with terror at the indifference of their wombs to the Egyptian law . <p> The province of Goshen was living under the New Egypt and the New Egyptian and they were made to know it in many ways . The sign of the new order towered over places of preference . It shadowed over work , and fear was given body and wings . <p> The Hebrews had already been driven out of their well-built homes and shoved further back in Goshen . Then came more decrees : <p> Israel , you are slaves from now on . Pharaoh assumes no responsibility for the fact that some of you got old before he came to power . Old as well as young must work in his brickyards and road camps . <br> No sleeping after dawn . Fifty lashes for being late to work . <br> Fifty lashes for working slow . <br> One hundred lashes for being absent . <br> One hundred lashes for sassing the bossman . <br> Death for hitting a foreman . <br> Babies take notice : Positively no more boy babies allowed among Hebrews . Infants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hebrews were disarmed and prevented from becoming citizens of Egypt , they found out that they were aliens , and from one new decree to the next they sank lower and lower . So they had no comfort left but to beat their breasts to crush the agony inside . Israel had learned to weep . <p> <br> <p> Chapter Two <p> The sun was setting . Under the brilliant , cloudless Egyptian sun thousands of Hebrew workers were struggling with building stones . Some of their backs were bloody from the lash ; many of them were stoopy from age and all of them were sweaty and bent and tired from work . The Egyptian foreman gazed at the drooping sun in awe and breathed with reverence : " Ah , Horus , golden god ! Lord of both horizons . The weaver of the beginning of things ! " <p> Amram , struggling with the help of another man to move a heavy stone into place in the foundation , heard him and looked up . <p> " Horus may be all those good things to the Egyptians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fry our backs . " <p> " I heard him what he said , " the other worker whispered back . " If Horus is the weaver of the beginning of things , he 's done put some mighty strange threads in his loom . " <p> " And still and all I used to admire him too , before this new government come in , did n't you ? " <p> " Uhuh . I used to admire everything in Egypt . But the palms and the plains ai n't scenery to me no more . They just look like suffering to me now . " <p> " They look that way to me too , now , " Amram whispered back , " and the worst part about it is , my wife is going to have another baby . " <p> " I heard about it , Amram . What you going to do ? Take her off in the wilderness like I did mine ? " <p> " Do n't know exactly , Caleb . One man was telling me he hid his wife out in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a girl so it was all right . " <p> " How soon you expecting ? " <p> " Of course you ca n't never be sure exactly , but we figure in two or three days more . I 'm planning on hunting up some good cave or some place like that the secret police do n't know about yet . Thought I 'd take tonight to locate a place . Will you go along with me ? " <p> " Sure I will . You got the midwife engaged ? " <p> " Yes , that 's all fixed up . Going to send my boy Aaron and my girl Miriam along to help around generally . They can do little things around and watch out for spies . Old Puah , the midwife , knows her business all right and she 's just as loyal as she can be , but she 's getting kind of old , you know . " <p> " That 's right . It 's good you got a sizeable boy and girl to run errands and to stand watch . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . " <p> " Oh , yes , and that 's how come I want to find a place and get it sort of fixed up with a quilt or two for my wife to rest on and some water and things like that so when the time comes I wo n't need to worry . It 's a sin and a shame our wives ca n't even have a baby in peace . " <p> " And that 's just the reason I want to go with that delegation to see old Pharaoh tonight . You know a bunch of us are going tonight to see him to protest these new decrees , do n't you ? " <p> " Sure , but I do n't believe it 'll do a bit of good . Still and all I want to go just to see what he 's going to say this time . <p> <br> Continues ...
