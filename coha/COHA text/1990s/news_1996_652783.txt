<p> WHEN 7-YEAR-OLD RAZIEH , DISobeying her mother , goes to watch some snake charmers , a neighborhood woman chides her for being where girls are n't supposed to be . Razieh , the character at the center of " The White Balloon , " replies , " I wanted to see what it was that was not good for me to watch . " <p> Like many current Iranian films , " The White Balloon " creeps to the very edge of what Iran 's censors consider good to watch . Just beneath the surface of its deceptively simple story lies a catalogue of Iranian social ills , among them poverty , the tension between the pre- and post-revolutionary generation , racial prejudice and even hints of child abuse . <p> Earlier this month , in protest over a United States Government decision to support a $20 million covert plan against the Iranian Government , Iran tried to withdraw " The White Balloon " as its official entry in the best foreign-language film category for the Academy Awards . But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was delivered here , it 's eligible and we 're going to screen it , " says Bruce Davis , executive director of the Academy . <p> The attention may end up helping " The White Balloon , " which is up against 40 other entrants in its category . And by leaving the film in competition , the Academy may have kept Iran from gagging a star witness in its own defense . Jafar Panahi 's gentle movie , which opened on Wednesday , is itself an eloquent protest against outdated United States stereotyping of Iranians as a nation of wild-eyed Islamic extremists . <p> The people of " The White Balloon " are neighborhood folks : shopkeepers and housewives concerned with getting the next meal on the table and arriving at the in-laws ' place on time . In this , and in " The Jar , " an Iranian film that played in New York last year about attempts to repair a cracked water jar at an impoverished desert school , small events become the stage on which larger issues are played out . <p> Social criticism is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they must withstand . Each film must be approved both in screenplay and in final cut . The cast and crew must be vetted for political and religious correctness , and a rating system determines how wide and well publicized the film 's release will be . <p> Even with these restrictions , though , Iranian films remain surprisingly severe on the subjects of Government failures and social malaise . Like the Iranian press , which is allowed to be more critical than is typical in other Middle Eastern countries , movies too are allowed to express a range of opinion . What is not allowed is sex and gratuitous violence . Perhaps it is the absence of these two Hollywood standbys that makes watching Iranian movies like " The White Balloon " so refreshing to Western audiences . <p> Film makers who have continued to work in Iran since the revolution may be zealous former revolutionaries like Mohsen Makhmalbaf ; his 1989 film , " Marriage of the Blessed , " indicted the swift marginalization of Islamic idealists in a society still run by a careless rich elite . Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the cultural soul of their country rather than emigrating in search of a more hospitable creative environment . <p> Iranian films , especially those by Abbas Kiarostami like " Through the Olive Trees , " have been increasingly admired at international film festivals . ( Mr. Kiarostami wrote the screenplay for " The White Balloon . " ) In April the Walter Reade Theater in New York will begin a monthlong retrospective of Mr. Kiarostami 's films and showcase new Iranian movies . <p> Iran 's mullahs have n't exactly reveled in such attention . Iran 's leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , has noted that Western film juries often give prizes to movies that show Iran 's poverty and distress . Of course , the same juries give prizes mainly to Western films that similarly show their society 's ills . One example with which the Ayatollah Khamenei may be familiar is " Dances With Wolves , " the 1990 Oscar winner for best picture , director , screenplay , original score , cinematography , editing and sound recording . It also happens to be one of the few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was approved because its stark portrayal of brutality toward American Indians shows the Great Satan in a bad light . <p> " The White Balloon , " winner of the Camera d'Or for best first feature film at the 1995 Cannes Film Festival , is striking in its almost entirely secular portrayal of Iranian daily life . Apart from an early scene in which a character passes a prayer place , from which voices rise and fall , blessing the prophet Mohammed , the film contains no reference to Islam . <p> The action takes place on the eve of the Persian feast of Nowruz . After the revolution , the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , trying to elevate the importance of religious holidays , discouraged observance of this pre-Islamic New Year festival . But Shiite Islam 's gloomy commemorations of martyrdom could n't vanquish Nowruz . Despite harassment , Iranians clung to their joyful spring feast , which takes place on the equinox . These days it is observed with as much verve as ever . <p> For Nowruz , Iranians clean house , bathe carefully and don new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingering ills from the old year . The table is decorated with a mirror , candle and white foods . Light , fire and white are all representative of God in Zoroastrianism , the ancient Persian religion . In an echo of the ceremonial foods of the Jewish springtime Passover table , Persians assemble seven foods whose names begin with the letter S , like sabzi  --  green herbs symbolizing nature 's springtime rebirth . There must also be a goldfish bowl , with the goldfish representing the mystery and joy of life . <p> It is the quest of Razieh ( played by Aida Mohammadkhani ) for a plump " dancing " goldfish that propels the action of " The White Balloon . " <p> Iranian films often have child protagonists , to avoid the mine field of Islamic restrictions on the portrayal of adult male-female relationships . Actors portraying a married couple , for instance , can not touch each other on screen unless they are also married in real life because it is a violation of Islam for unrelated men and women to touch . And actresses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must cover all the hair and curves of the body , even in scenes depicting private moments in the home where , in real life , every woman sheds her Islamic coverings . In addition , there can not be any extended close-ups of attractive actresses , because that might be construed as exploiting female beauty . <p> With the 7-year-old star of " The White Balloon , " this is n't an issue . The child , with her gap-toothed smile and tragic eyes , gives an incandescent performance . A critic for The Hollywood Reporter says she " displays a range of emotions that would stymie Meryl Streep . " <p> Razieh nags her mother into letting her buy the goldfish , then accidentally drops the money down a sidewalk grate and persuades various passers-by to help her retrieve it . Alternately kvetching and sobbing , then lit up with hope and delight , Razieh has an intensity that drags the viewer back into the sometimes terrible realm of childhood , where the loss of a few dollars can be a catastrophe . <p> The film is shot almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world ; it is unpanoramic , with the focal point always on what is close and immediate . At times the frames have the intimate feel of Persian miniatures , with Teheran 's weathered mud bricks providing the geometrically patterned background and impassive onlookers gazing from the sidelines at the doings of the passionate protagonists . <p> The film works almost flawlessly at its superficial level , re-creating the ardent intensity of childhood in a sometimes oblivious adult world . But there is so much more going on here . Each of Razieh 's encounters contains a small , ominous aside . Together these add up to a profile of the quiet desperation of ordinary Iranian lives in a society ravaged by revolution , war and international isolation . <p> In the early scenes , Razieh 's nagging is as relentlessly maddening as a midnight car alarm . It is evident that her mother ( played by Fereshteh Sadr Orfani ) , bustling to finish the shopping and cleaning in time for the New Year feast , is a victim of holiday stress . For one thing , she ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent of not being able to provide the major item on a Christmas list . For another , her husband , who appears in the film only as a bellowing voice , flinging soap and curses from the bathroom , keeps up a constant flow of distracting demands . <p> Like many economically struggling Teheranis , the meter-reader husband has a second job . But what he does to make ends meet is kept secret because it is somehow shameful or illicit . <p> Economic hardship is explored again when Razieh meets a lonely young conscript from the provinces who ca n't get home for New Year because he lacks the bus fare . Other social pressures emerge . An elderly tailor is intimidated by a young client of the post-revolutionary generation who knows how to use the new system against the old-timers . A young Afghan refugee is abused , used , then thanklessly abandoned in the film 's haunting final scene . And there is a suggestion that Razieh 's father may have punched her brother in the face . <p> Perhaps to emphasize the characters ' isolation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film " Moscow on the Hudson , " when every New Yorker turned out to be from someplace else , the Teheranis in " The White Balloon " speak Farsi accented by Polish , Turkish and thick regional patois . <p> Mr. Panahi , the 35-year-old director of " The White Balloon , " was to have visited the United States to promote the film during its American release . Instead , friends say he is " location scouting " in the provinces and could not be reached to comment on the attempted withdrawal of his film from Oscar consideration . <p> Previously , Mr. Panahi has identified the sequence in which Razieh watches the snake charmers as one of his favorites . The scene , he said , was drawn straight from his own childhood , when he defied his father to sneak into " unsuitable " films . Like Razieh , he too " wanted to see what it was that was not good for me to watch . "
