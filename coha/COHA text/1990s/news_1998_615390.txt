<p> The contents of the glass-covered , oak pseudo-locker set off from the rest in the Texas Longhorns ' dressing room include a cardboard box filled with light fixtures , an electric power strip , several plastic bags from Wal-Mart and a fine coating of dust . <p> That soon will change . <p> By early next year , it will hold a jersey , helmet and etched bio of the most prolific running back in major-college history . It will sit right next to one holding the No. 20 of Heisman Trophy winner Earl Campbell , at the far right end of a cluster that also include hermetically sealed shrines to Darrell Royal , Tommy Nobis , Scott Appleton , Tony Degrate , Brad Shearer and Kenneth Sims . <p> It will honor Ricky Williams , who will leave Texas as the most decorated player in Longhorns history : likely with two Doak Walker Awards , two-time consensus All-American honors , a Maxwell Award , a Heisman Trophy and 11 NCAA records . <p> Three weeks ago as he recited numbers , his numbers , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion that maybe , just maybe , Williams was being less than sincere when a half hour earlier he had professed to a cluster of media that he did n't care about records . <p> " Only one , " he replied simply . And now it 's his . <p> With a 60-yard touchdown run in the first quarter in his final game at Royal-Memorial Stadium , Williams passed former Pitt star Tony Dorsett as the NCAA Division I-A career leading rusher . Dorsett , whose perimeter speed was no match for the slow-footed defenses of his era , ran for 6,082 yards for Pitt from 1973 to ' 76 and finished his career with a national title and Heisman Trophy . <p> For 22 years the mark stood . The career passing record ? Last broken in ' 91 by Ty Detmer . Career receiving yards ? Two years ago by Marcus Harris of Wyoming . Scoring ? Just this season by Williams . But before that ? In ' 91 by Houston kicker Roman Anderson . A jump ahead For all practical purpose , Dorsett was the Bob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 29 feet , 2 1/2 inches at the ' 68 Olympics in Mexico City , folks figured it would never be broken . One sports biomechanic , examining the physics of Beamon 's quantum leap , calculated the force and torque needed to break it would shred the ligaments and tear the tendons holding the athlete 's hip together . Bottom line ? Hip  --  breakable . Record  --  not . <p> As time went on , if seemed as if Dorsett 's mark would be the same rarefied air . It was n't that the effort would destroy the aspiring record-breaker , just that no one would even get close enough to attempt that leap . Eight-man fronts ? Try eight-figure signing bonuses . Juniors could n't resist . <p> But just as Mike Powell jumped long enough to defy prophecies of life with a walker  --  leaping 29 feet , 4 1/2 inches at the ' 91 World Championships in Tokyo  --  Ricky Williams stuck around long enough to defy prophecies of life without a runner . <p> Williams and Dorsett were different runners . Dorsett , barely 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Williams , at 6 feet , 230 , had outstanding speed but was just as willing to take the direct route . <p> Dorsett 's coach , Johnny Majors , was asked about his former star . <p> " Like Jim Brown , Tony was slow getting up , " Majors said . " He checked all of his surroundings  --  the defense , the scoreboard , the chains . Those eyes were always in action . <p> " I do n't think I ever had to tell him anything twice . He had so much pride , he never wanted you to have to tell him anything twice . " <p> Majors could just as easily have been talking about Williams . <p> In 1995 , in his second stint at Pitt , Majors coached against a freshman fullback making only his second career start . " I could see he would be excellent , because of his power , speed and open-field ability , " Majors said of Williams . " He was very impressive . " <p> There are multitude backs with great physical skills . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williams has accomplished took more than 4.38 speed , hydraulic thighs and a stiff arm that could probably fend off a floored Volkswagen . <p> It took durability . In four seasons , Williams has overcome a badly sprained ankle , a stress fracture in his foot , fractured ribs , a pulled thigh muscle , a stomach ulcer and a stomped-on shin . What it took It took perseverance . In his first season and a half , Williams had 20 or more carries in a game only once . Even without a passing game to turn to last year , former coach John Mackovic gave Williams the ball more than 19 times only once in the first four games . Then he carried 40 times for 223 yards against Oklahoma , and it became obvious to everybody that Williams was the Horns ' only fearsome threat . He never had fewer than 20 carries a game the rest of his career . <p> Blessing ? It saved him some pounding . Curse ? Dorsett carried 1,074 times in his career . The play on which Williams broke Dorsett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 403 touches in 1981 , the year he set a then single-season record of 2,342 yards . Both played at least a decade in the NFL . Dorsett is in the Hall of Fame ; Allen is on his way . That begs the question : What record would we be talking about if Williams had gotten more than 166 carries as a freshman , or 205 as a sophomore ? <p> It took a strong supporting cast . Williams has had James Brown and Major Applewhite to throw the ball , Priest Holmes and Shon Mitchell to provide alternative rushing threats , Mike Adams , Pat Fitzgerald , Wane McGarity and Kwame Cavil to keep safeties honest , Ricky Brown to lead him into the hole , and a veteran offensive line that included All-American Dan Neil and three players who have started the past three seasons . <p> It took timing . Last year Division I-A teams averaged 158.7 yards a game rushing , the lowest since 1966 . Whither the run ? Hardly . Of the top eight single-season rushing totals in major college history , five have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byron Hanspard of Texas Tech ran for 2,084 yards , fifth-best ever  --  but only second-best that season . Teams may not be running as well , but individuals are running better than ever . Right time . Right place . <p> It took explosiveness . You do n't slog your way to 6,279 yards . None of the top five rushers all-time averaged fewer than 5.29 yards a carry . All broke at least one run over 70 yards . Williams has five longer than that , and three more of at least 60 , four more of at least 50 and a total of 17 at least 40 yards . Taking his shots It took color-blindness . Williams could n't recognize the color green . Three backs with better totals after their junior season  --  Herschel Walker , Marshall Faulk and Hanspard  --  could n't resist , leaving early for the riches of pro football . All mortgaged potential collegiate immortality for more-or-less nondescript NFL careers . Williams wanted it all . Projected as perhaps the top pick in the April draft , if the new Cleveland Browns decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he may get it . <p> It took guts . The only numbers guaranteed about Williams ' senior year were the ones he wore on his jersey . Even a switch from 11 to 34 , though , would n't keep teams from zeroing in him , stacking the line of scrimmage and doing everything within their power to keep him from beating them . Opponents have hit him late , stood him up and taken their shots . One Baylor player stomped on his shin . Another ripped off his helmet . Before the season , at the urging of his family and advisors , he took out a $ 2.9 million insurance policy in case of injury and then took forever to finish the paperwork . " When I was at Iowa State we had a senior back named Dwayne Crutchfield , " Texas coach Mack Brown recalled . " After one game , an opposing coach came up to me and said , ' Since we do n't have to play against him again , I 'll tell you  --  you have tendencies with Crutchfield . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say  --  we ran him 49 times . ' Sometimes with great players , you have tendencies . . . . The great thing about Ricky is if you hand it to him enough , he 'll get his yards . " <p> Texas offensive coordinator Greg Davis said : " To put it in perspective , in my 26 years of coaching , I 've been around one national record . That includes Eric Zeier ( at Georgia ) leading the nation in passing . Then I get here , and Ricky 's breaking a new one every week . " <p> Big numbers : Ricky Williams came back to Texas for his senior season and took aim at Tony Dorsett 's 22-year-old rushing mark . / ERIC GAY / Associated Press Photo UNIV . TX. -R .
