The only sexual shock in my life happened at the Telman Vegetable Processing Plant . I was a freshman at Leningrad University , and we had been sent off to do volunteer work for the directors of that fruit and vegetable plant . There were fifteen or so of us in the group . We were divided into teams , three in each . Before that we received instructions . The representative of the local union committee said , " You may eat as much as you want . " <p> My classmate Lebedev asked , " How about to take out ? " <p> The explanation was forthcoming : " You can carry out whatever you 've eaten . " <p> We went off in our teams . I got an assignment right away . The foreman said , " Go to Cooler Four . Remember this name  --  Mishchuk . Get copies of yesterday 's invoices . " <p> I asked , " Where is Cooler Four ? " <p> " Behind the ramp . " <p> " And where is the ramp ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I wanted to ask where the narrow-gauge was but changed my mind . I was n't in any hurry . I 'd find it . <p> It turned out that the plant occupied a huge territory . It stretched south to the Piskarevka railroad station . Its northern border followed a nameless river . I got lost quickly . People were wandering among identical-looking brick packing houses . I asked a few about Cooler Four . The answers were unintelligible and distracted . I later learned that the plant was the site of embezzlement from the state of particularly large scope . Everyone was stealing . Without exception . And that 's why everyone had that distracted , preoccupied look . <p> People carried off fruit in their pockets and inside their shirts . In loose pants tied at the ankle . In musical-instrument cases . They stuffed their capacious briefcases with fruit . <p> The truck drivers acted more decisively . An empty truck drives into the plant . It goes to a special weighing station . On the way out the loaded truck is weighed again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And what did the drivers do ? They drove inside . Got weighed . Then they pulled over and took out a sixty-kilo hunk of lead from the cab . They hid it in the ravine . Then they loaded up their trucks and came away with an extra sixty kilograms of cargo . <p> But these were mere trifles . Most of the embezzlement took place on paper . In the quiet of the administrative accounting offices . In the thick of the profit-and-loss ledgers . <p> But I learned all that later . At the moment I was wandering around amid some unpainted trailers . It was a cloudy , humid day . A wide , smoky pink band hovered over the horizon . Four stray dogs lay on the grass near the fire pump like old rags . <p> Suddenly I heard a woman 's voice . " Hey ! Dimwit ! Give me a hand . " <p> She meant me . I wanted to walk past without looking back . I am always reacting to the most bizarre calls . And with a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open shed door , with a heavily made-up girl looking out . " I mean you . " <p> And then she said , " Help me get some crates from the top row . " <p> I went into the shed . It was stuffy and dark in there . Women worked in the narrow passage between piled-up crates of cabbage . There must have been twelve of them . And they were all naked . Rather , half-naked , which is more frightening . Their blue woolly underpants were filled with huge , movable buttocks . Their pink bras with marked seams displayed the fruit-like splendor of their forms . All the more so , since some of the women preferred to use their brassieres as bands around their crazy heads . So that their globular ornaments sparkled in the stuffy gloom like night stars . <p> I felt dizzy and stifled at the same time . Soaring and sinking . As if I were swimming in molten lead . I said in a loud voice , " What 's the problem , comrades ? " and passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten cabbage . The women were pouring water on me from a tin can labeled " codfish fillet . " I wanted to be swallowed up by the ground . That minute , without ever getting up . <p> The women bent over me . From the floor their nakedness was even scarier . The pink cups were so taut they made my ears ring . The blue underpants bulged below like pillowcases filled with straw . One of the women said sorrowfully , " What kind of an act is this ? You get the cards but run out of money . " <p> " The music did n't play very long , " another one said . " The guy did n't dance very long , either . " <p> A third bent closer , straightened , and told her girlfriends , " Hey , take a look , he 's got a zipper on his pants , like a purse . " <p> I realized that I had to make a run for it . I slowly got on all fours , then stood by pulling myself up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't feel so good , " and left . <p> The women scattered from the shed . One shouted , " Hey , student , do n't run off fully loaded . Come back here . " <p> Another one said , " Leave your thingy for Zoya to make meat loaf . " <p> And a third added , " No , give it to me , as a loan . I 'll send it back C.O.D .  --  cock on delivery ! " <p> At least an old woman in a dirty white skirt said reproachfully , " You 're shameless hussies , I see . " And then she said to me , " And you , do n't be so shy . Do n't be like jelly , be like steel . " <p> As I walked away , I thought to myself , Oh , how can I go on ? It 's wrong to be a virgin at my age ! Where can I get some cyanide ? <p> And I got lost again . This time for good . <p> I passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a path leading to a ramp . Then I turned the corner of a two-story gray building . Hospital kitchen smells rushed out of its open doors . I asked some guy , " What is this place ? " <p> He said , " The canteen . " <p> A minute later I noticed narrow-gauge tracks in the grass . I followed them for thirty yards . And then I saw Zaichenko and Lebedev , from my class . They were with a group of laborers led by the foreman . When they saw me , they shouted , " There he is ! There he is . " <p> The foreman asked wanly , " Where 've you been ? " <p> " I was looking for Cooler Four . " <p> " Find it ? " <p> " Not yet . " <p> " Then come with us . " <p> " What about the invoices ? " <p> " What invoices ? " <p> " The invoices I was supposed to get from Mishchuk . " <p> Just then a woman with a briefcase stopped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Yes ? " the foreman replied . This is a nightmare , I thought . <p> The woman pulled a bust of Tchaikovsky out of her briefcase . She handed the foreman a blue form to sign . " On the line . It 's for the second quarter . " The foreman signed , picked up Tchaikovsky by the neck , and we went on . <p> A train stood by the tall platform . The platform led to the open doors of a huge warehouse . A swarthy Georgian man in a green cap with earflaps was pacing near the doors . His jodhpurs were tucked into tight , shiny boots . He turned sharply toward us . His nylon raincoat rustled like a newspaper . <p> The foreman asked him , " Are you in charge ? " Instead of an answer , the man grabbed his head and moaned , " I 'm miserable ... I 'm a poor , miserable man . " <p> The foreman interrupted abruptly . " How much ? " <p> " According to the invoice , 194 tons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much are you short ? " <p> The Georgian said , " Just a little . Four tons short . Actually , ten . At most , sixteen tons . " <p> The foreman shook his head . " You 're a card , pal . You moved sixteen tons of grapes . How 'd you manage that ? " <p> The visitor explained . " People come up at every station . Our own Soviet people . ' Dear Bala , ' they say , ' give us a few grapes . ' I have a kind heart . ' Take , ' I say . " <p> " Right , " the foreman said . " And so you push sixteen tons of state property . And not without some profit to you . " <p> The man clutched his head again . " I know it was a risk ! I know I could go to jail ! But I have a kind heart and I ca n't say no ! " <p> Then he lowered his head and said sorrowfully , " Listen , foreman ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget you . And I 'll thank you generously . " <p> The foreman replied slowly , " It 's within our power . " And then came the question , " How much ? " <p> The foreman led the man aside . Then they argued over money . The foreman chopped the air with his hand . It looked as if he were going to turn the man into coleslaw . The man clutched his head and ran up and down the platform . <p> Finally , the foreman returned and said , " That mountain hero is short sixteen tons . We 'll have to draw them , boys . The man 's being tight about it , but he 's got nowhere to go , he 's on the hook . Sixteen tons means the pitchfork . " <p> My classmate Zaichenko asked , " What does draw mean ? " <p> The foreman replied , " That means doing a trick . " <p> " And what 's the pitchfork ? " wondered Lebedev . <p> " Prison , " explained the foreman . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach them in college , anyway ? " <p> " Not prison , " a bearded truck loader corrected gleefully , " the chair . " And then he added , joyously , " We 're talking grand embezzlement . " <p> Another loader said , " He should have been more modest . Steal , but know your limit . " <p> The foreman raised his hand . And then he spoke directly to me . " The technique is simple . Watch what the older comrades do . As they say , let Communists be your role model . " <p> We formed a line . The Georgian noisily opened the doors of the freight car . A ramp came down to the platform . <p> Two men went into the freight car . They handed us wooden crates . They were filled with bunches of dark blue grapes . <p> A light went on in the warehouse . Auntie Zina , the warehouse keeper , showed up . She carried a fat notebook , with a pencil marking a place in it . She had wound a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her eyeglasses were tied with twine at the back of her head . <p> We worked in a chain . Put the crates on the scales . Piled them up high . Then the keeper would write down the weight and say , " You can take them away . " <p> And then here 's what we 'd do . We would take the crates down from the scales , go around nearsighted Auntie Zina , and put the same crates back on the scales . And then go around her once more . After four times with the same crates , we 'd carry them off to the far end of the warehouse . <p> After twenty minutes , the foreman said , " We 've got two tons . " The Georgian would peek into the warehouse from time to time . Smiling broadly , he watched us work . Then he 'd go back to his pacing , singing : I 'll give you a chrysanthemum/And my first love ... <p> An hour later the foreman announced , " Break . " We left the cooler . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " We 've drawn you eight tons . And now let 's talk about love . How much ? " <p> " I told you , four hundred . " <p> " You 're hurting my feelings , buddy . " <p> " I told you , four . " <p> " Fine , " the foreman said with a laugh . " We 'll see . Later . " <p> Then he came over to me . He looked at me and asked , " Do you remember the roads of Smolenshchina , Alyosha ? " <p> " What 's that ? " I asked , not understanding . <p> " Do me a favor , " he said . " Tell me the contents of War and Peace . In just two words . " <p> I was completely bewildered . Everyone was crazy . <p> " What 's the matter ? " I asked . " What is this ? " <p> The foreman lowered his voice . " Is Professor Viktor Manuilov still alive ? " <p> " Yes , " I replied . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Of course . " <p> " And Gregori Byaly ? " <p> " I hope so . " <p> " And Professor Serman ? " <p> " Yes , what about him ? " <p> " I defended my dissertation under him in 1961 . " <p> " Do you mean you 're a college graduate ? " <p> " Cum laude . " <p> " Then why are you here ? " <p> " Where should I be ? Where should I be working , in your opinion ? In a school ? And what can I steal there  --  blackboard erasers ? When you get a job you have to think of three things : what , where , and how . What will I be able to steal ? Where will I be able to steal it ? And how will I be able to steal it ? Understand ? Fine , then . Everything will be fine . We 'll have what we want by nightfall . " <p> I blushed and shuddered . The foreman explained , " The money , I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . " <p> We went back in . Now something even stranger began to happen in the cooler . The loaders carried the crates from the freight car . One out of four hurried over to the scales . The other three carried the crates behind the keeper 's back , without weighing them . <p> Bala got worried . He sang a less happy tune : I 'm miserable Ismail/Without a penny ... His wealth was melting before his very eyes . The drawn eight tons were diminishing rapidly . Thirty minutes passed . <p> The foreman said , " Two tons , as if they were never here , returned to the socialist state . " <p> In another half-hour he announced , " Another two and a half tons returned to the socialist state . " <p> Bala broke . He called the foreman for a conference . But the foreman said , " Speak openly , before witnesses . " <p> Bala said , with a tragic grimace , " You said six hundred ? Kill me , go ahead , I 'm ready ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's go back to work . We 'll talk later . " <p> Now we were back to the first technique . We put the crates on the scales . Went around the keeper . Put the crates back on the scales . Three or four times . And only then took the crates into the warehouse . <p> Our Georgian was feeling better . He was back to his first song . <p> Forty minutes passed . The foreman stopped the work . The old woman pulled out her thermos from inside her shirt . We went out on the platform . Bala opened another pack of Kazbeks . The foreman said , " We 've drawn ten tons . " And then he turned to Bala . " You said six hundred . " <p> " I did n't say six . You said six . You have me by the throat . " <p> " Does n't matter , " the foreman said . " I 've changed my mind . Now I say eight hundred . That 's a fine , pal , for being so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nasty and threatening way . Bala turned purple . " Listen , I do n't have that kind of money . " <p> " Yes you do , " said the foreman . " Let 's get to work . " <p> And we started bringing in the crates without weighing them . <p> And Bala went back to his sad song : I 'm miserable Ismail/Without a penny . . . Then he burst out , " This is murder . I 'll pay eight hundred ! " <p> And we went back to putting the crates on the scales three times , and running behind the keeper 's back . And Bala was singing about his chrysanthemum again . <p> And foreman Mishchuk said again , " I 've changed my mind . We want a thousand . " <p> And Bala clutched his head . And sixteen tons turned into nine . And then into fourteen . And then into two and a quarter . And then sixteen tons once more . And from the platform we 'd hear the familiar I 'll give you a chrysanthemum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm miserable Ismail ... <p> It was getting dark when the foreman said for the last time , " This is my final word . Sixteen hundred . And right now , right here , in cash ... Answer me , pal , right now , yes or no . " <p> Bala cried , " You 've killed me ! " and sat down on the edge of the platform . He grabbed the heel of his boot and pulled it off . The tight-fitting boot came off like snakeskin . Bala groaned as he pulled out his sinewy , bluish feet , which were encased in rubles . Removing a small pack of hundred-ruble bills , he whispered , " Take it . " <p> He then wrapped the remaining bank notes around his ankles and held them in place with pink sticky bandages . He pulled his boots back on . <p> " Where 's your Kazbeks ? " the foreman demanded . <p> The man pulled out a third pack of cigarettes gladly . And then he said to the foreman , " Come visit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll roast a sheep . Introduce you to a fine girl ... " <p> Mishchuk mocked him . " Introduce you to a sheep , roast a girl ... What girls are you talking about , buddy ? My oldest daughter is your age . " <p> He called over Auntie Zina . He gave her a hundred rubles , which she put in her thermos . Then he gave each of us a hundred . <p> Bala wanted to hug him . " Wait , " the foreman said . He rummaged around in a pile of clothes . He pulled out the bust of Tchaikovsky . He handed it to the Georgian . " For you to remember me by . " <p> " Stalin , " whispered the man with reverence . He pulled off his green cap with earflaps . He was going to give it to the foreman . Then he hesitated and said in embarrassment , " I ca n't . My head gets cold . " <p> The foreman got another pack of Kazbeks . Bala stepped off the platform into the darkness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a chrysanthemum ... <p> " See you tomorrow , " the foreman told us . <p> I ended the day in the most unexpected way . I went home in a taxi . Stopped by a phone booth . Called the extravagant , married woman Regina Britterman and said , " Let 's go to dinner at the Astoria . " <p> Regina replied , " With pleasure . But I ca n't . I just washed my only whole pair of pantyhose . Why do n't you come here with a bottle of champagne . Lyalik is in Rybinsk , " she added . <p> Her elderly , thirty-year-old husband had the babyish name Lyalik . He had a Ph.D . in physics . <p> That day I became a man . First a thief and then a man . I think it 's related somehow . There 's something to think about in that , I feel . <p> And in the morning I wrote Hemingway 's lines in my teenage diary : " If a woman gives herself joyfully and without tragedy , it is a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with love . " Something like that . <p> To tell the truth , that was n't Hemingway . This was my own triumphant realization . And that phrase was the start of my ill-starred writing . In short , I had covered a marvelous road in a single day : from theft to literature . Not counting adultery . <p> I was done with adolescence . Waiting on the doorstep was my lonely , ridiculous , and joyless youth . <p> Sergei Dovlatov was born in the Soviet Union in 1941 and was the author of five books , including The Zone , a collection of stories . He died in 1990 in New York City . <p>
