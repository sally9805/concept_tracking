ALL REVVED UP AND NO WAY TO GO <p> For nearly 15 years , since oil shock began to recede , energy has had remarkably low priority in global policy councils . The time has come for a reevaluation , and nowhere is one more urgent than in the Pacific . Major changes in East Asian energy patterns are creating both danger and opportunities for troubled trans-Pacific relations chronically oriented toward the past . <p> Asia 's emerging energy problems cut subtly across the conventional boundary between economics and security . They have been further masked by the temporary collapse of demand in many markets , such as eastern Europe , since 1990 . But they are no less perilous for their obscurity . <p> The coming decade  --  if buoyant economic growth continues in Asia , as seems likely  --  holds the potential for severe strains between Asian powers as regional oil markets tighten while contenders for supplies grow more diverse and competitive . China , Japan , the Koreas , and most Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) members will be vigorously bidding for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more relaxed. 1 Changing supply routes for northeast Asian importers may spark geopolitical rivalries along the vulnerable sea-lanes that link Asia with the Middle East . Countries have already come to blows over their conflicting claims to offshore areas that may be rich in oil and gas . <p> Virtually all foreseeable futures pose unsettling dilemmas for Asia . Greater use of plentiful coal invites strip-mining , acid rain , and other environmental complications . Rapidly expanding nuclear power production raises safety concerns as well as the specter of nuclear proliferation . Continued reliance on oil means a tightening embrace of necessity between East Asia and the Middle East that , over the next generation , could fundamentally challenge the prevailing Western-dominated global order . CHINA 'S THIRST FOR OIL <p> At the root of Asia 's energy security problem is China  --  a rising , frustrated , revisionist power in which ideological communism is yielding to nationalism  --  and its new status as an oil importer . A decade ago the People 's Republic shipped nearly a quarter of its production abroad . But since the early 1990s China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by double-digit economic growth and the transition to a consumer economy . In November 1993 the country became a net importer of oil for the first time in more than a quarter-century , and the deficit has since soared to about 600,000 barrels a day . <p> The dependence on imports will likely deepen , in spite of sporadic efforts by Beijing to curb it . China 's per capita energy consumption is still only 40 percent of the world average , and per capita oil consumption little more than one-sixth . Korea uses 10 times as much oil per capita , Japan 20 times , and the United States 30 . <p> Over the coming decade three powerful engines will propel rising Chinese demand for oil : an automotive revolution , growing industrial production generally and energy-intensive manufacturing in particular , and expanding air travel . In 1994 China produced only 350,000 autos , many of them for state enterprises . But the aspiration among the Chinese middle class expected to exceed 200 million people within a generation  --  to own a car is clear and is supported by government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the country has a population of 1.2 billion , a long-range projection of 300 million cars on the road is not unreasonable . The production of petrochemicals , which , like cars for China 's masses , requires large quantities of oil , has been designated one of the country 's four " pillar industries for early 21st-century development , " along with auto manufacturing . Annual increases in the demand for petrochemicals climb well into the double digits , with plastics and fertilizers leading the way . Air travel has risen 20 percent a year in China since 1978 but still accounts for only 6 percent of total transport  --  very low for so sprawling a country . During the next two decades the demand for aviation fuel should grow at at least double the rate of overall energy consumption . <p> Logistics compound the country 's energy problem . The most explosive increases in demand are in the southeastern coastal provinces , notably Fujian and Guangdong , yet the southeast produces virtually no oil and relies heavily on imports . Northeastern oil fields like Daqing and Shengli are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves it , the 220 , 000-square-mile Tarim Basin of western Xinjiang province , close to the Russian border ; some experts suggest that Tarim could top Saudi Arabia 's proven reserves of nearly 250 billion barrels . Yet prospecting in Tarim 's desolate desert is torturous , and the oil , located in deep , small , hard-to-find pockets , is devilishly difficult to extract . Enormous investment in pipelines , roads , and telecommunications would also be necessary if this remote field were to be exploited . As it stands , Xinjiang accounts for less than seven percent of China 's oil production . According to the International Energy Agency , this may not change until well beyond 2010 , unless major foreign assistance is forthcoming . <p> The prospects for offshore oil in internationally recognized Chinese waters also appear quite limited . Multinational corporations have already invested more than $3 billion , with discouraging results , in the East and South China Seas as well as the Bo Hai Gulf . Potential significant reserves in offshore areas that China claims but other countries dispute have more obvious drawbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government needs economic growth to pacify the people as never before , China faces spiraling oil demand and limited short-term supply within its established frontiers . Thus it is likely to become a major and vigorous bidder in regional and global oil markets . Recent estimates from the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) organization suggest that China 's net external requirements will rise from some 600,000 barrels per day to over one million by 2000 and nearly three million by 2010 . That huge total  --  nearly half Saudi Arabia 's current production  --  would represent almost 20 percent of Asia 's oil imports . By 2015 , less than two decades hence , Shell China Petroleum Development estimates , Chinese imports of more than seven million barrels per day will approach the current imports of the United States . COMPETING WITH THE NEIGHBORS <p> China will be emerging as a major oil importer in a rapidly growing northeast Asian region whose other nations will be that much more precariously dependent on international supplies . Preeminent among the rival importers will be Japan , whose $4 trillion economy lacks any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 percent of the energy it consumes . Even with the gains from conservation campaigns in the 1970s and 1980s , Japan has a $50 billion annual bill for fuel imports and scant hope for substantial further reductions . <p> South Korea 's economy , with its large steel , shipbuilding , and petrochemical sectors , together with a growing middle class ever more addicted to driving , is even more energy-intensive than Japan 's . Yet it has still less domestic energy at hand . South Korea 's annual energy import bill is triple Japan 's as a fraction Of GNP and includes an oil demand component rising 20 percent a year . A smaller and less influential nation than the economic giant across the Sea of Japan , South Korea has more difficulty competing for oil in times of shortage , as was patent during the two oil shocks of the 1970s and the Persian Gulf crisis of 1990-91 . Its fears about energy security seem likely to deepen over the next two decades as the prospective reunification of the peninsula swells local demand and Chinese competition intensifies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in Korea and as formerly in Japan , by a tense geostrategic context . Unlike Korea , Taiwan lacks substantial coal reserves and must import large amounts of that fuel along with oil . The bill is more than twice what it was in the mid-1980s , and more than 40 times higher than in 1975 . APEC forecasts that the burden will double again in the next 15 years . <p> ASEAN has been a net energy exporter to the rest of Asia , buttressed by the Indonesian oil fields that were the primary target of imperial Japan 's December 1941 Southeast Asian offensive . But today , throughout the region and especially in Indonesia , subsidized domestic energy prices and inadequate incentives for exploration and production are accelerating the trend toward oil importer status . Despite expanding production in Vietnam , ASEAN should become a net importer just after the turn of the century . <p> Asia 's oil market thus seems poised to undergo dramatic , destabilizing shifts . New importers will enter the fray , particularly China and ASEAN members . By 2010 , predicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Energy , they will transform a market dominated by Japan ( 77 percent of Asia 's oil imports in 1992 ) into one delicately balanced among Japan ( 37 percent ) , China ( 19 percent ) , Korea ( 18 percent ) , the ASEAN countries ( 17 percent ) , and Taiwan and Hong Kong ( 9 percent ) . <p> A dynamic Asia will become increasingly dependent on the volatile Middle East  --  including Iran and possibly Iraq  --  where the oil is abundant . By 2000 , the East-West Center estimates , 87 percent of the oil East Asian nations import will flow from the Middle East , up from 70 percent today ; by 2010 dependence on Middle Eastern oil could reach 95 percent . The heart of the dependence could increasingly be China 's relations with Iraq and Iran  --  two countries accounting for nearly 20 percent of proven global oil reserves  --  which in the past have involved significant arms transfers . A growing fleet of laden super-tankers will plow across the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean in coming decades , headed for Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the next 15 years , East Asian oil imports from the Middle East could easily triple to more than 15 percent of global consumption . Russian reserves , which include an estimated 20 percent of the oil and 39 percent of the gas on earth , could forestall this development , as could the discovery of large-scale offshore fields in the East or South China Seas , but the prospects for both are clouded by political uncertainty and infrastructure problems . So unless other forces intervene to arrest the trend , the Middle East and Asia , the two major economic and geopolitical centers of the non-Western world , are likely to grow closer . The global implications are unsettling . MISCHIEF REEFS <p> The new energy realities contribute to Chinas aspirations to develop a blue-water navy capable of force projection in the South and East China Seas , the Indian Ocean , and beyond . They also give it incentives to reassert offshore territorial claims on its continental shelf . Beijing 's 1992 Territorial Sea Law and a series of military actions reflect its willingness to advance these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea , the strategic importance of the area and the value of any oil and gas adjacent to the booming southeastern coast are undeniable . <p> China 's published military budget has risen 75 percent since 1988 , after adjusting for inflation . And the totals it lists are significantly lower than actual spending since they include neither weapons procurement nor the share of profits from military-run enterprises that are plowed back into defense . Energy-vulnerable neighbors worry about a Chinese giant ever more voracious for oil and now better armed and increasingly nationalist . <p> The flash point for these tensions is the South China Sea . Through the sea pass the maritime routes that supply 70 percent of Japan 's and the Koreas ' oil imports and growing portions of other Asian nations ' energy needs . The area may also contain substantial oil and , especially , gas reserves , although political uncertainties and a tendency for deposits to be small , deep , and expensive to explore make judgment difficult ; recent Chinese estimates have suggested reserves 20 percent larger than Kuwait 's , although many Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area , based on an association going back to the voyages of Admiral Zheng He in the fourteenth century , but five other claimants  --  Vietnam , the Philippines , Brunei , Malaysia , and Taiwan-dispute Chinese sovereignty in several potentially oil-rich sectors . Violence has flared on several occasions . In 1988 nearly 150 people were killed in a confrontation between Chinese and Vietnamese forces in the Spratly Islands . As recently as January 1995 , Chinese troops removed Filipino fisherman from Mischief Reef in the Spratlys , less than 150 miles from major Philippine oil reserves off Palawan Island , and two months later Taiwanese artillery fired on a Vietnamese supply ship not far away . <p> Tokyo was especially sensitive about the Mischief Reef incident , both because of what it signaled regarding Chinese intentions in an area of strategic importance to Japan and because of the specific encroachment on Philippine claims , which touches important Japanese business interests engaged on the Philippines ' Palawan Shelf . Japan has even more reason to be concerned about recent developments in the East China Sea , directly adjacent to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farther south . Last summer China began geological explorations near the Senkaku Islands ( Diauyutai to the Chinese ) , over which the two countries staged a tense confrontation in 1974 . Last December a Chinese oil-drilling ship was spotted anchored in Japanese-claimed waters 200 nautical miles north-northeast of the Senkakus , prompting Japanese diplomatic protests to Beijing . There were indications that the dispute could seriously escalate , with the commencement of actual drilling and China and Japan 's mutual establishment of exclusive economic zones . <p> South Korea , which imports virtually all its oil through the South and East China Seas , has expanded its naval forces since the early 1990s and begun a significant technical modernization program in the military . Indeed , its defense budget has risen more rapidly since 1990 in local currency terms than that of any other country in northeast Asia , with the bulk of new spending arguably directed more at emerging regional naval and air contingencies than the decades-old struggle with North Korea . A naval arms race among China , Japan , and possibly South Korea sparked by the changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . <p> The most substantial and modern naval force in the region , apart from the U.S. force stationed there , clearly belongs to the Japanese . It includes some 100 maritime aircraft , among them a fleet of PC-3 submarine surveillance aircraft second in size only to the U.S. one , together with more than 60 principal surface combatants and 18 submarines . To better cover the country 's sprawling naval defense perimeter and huge array of maritime concerns , Japan recently began launching a series of at least three destroyers equipped with U.S. Aegis radar surveillance and tracking systems , at a billion dollars each . Tokyo is also planning to acquire tanker aircraft to extend the range of its maritime air coverage and has for several years considered obtaining " defensive " aircraft carriers . Acquisition of a full-scale blue-water navy would be enormously expensive  --  probably over $30 billion or $40 billion for even modestly credible capabilities  --  and time-consuming for Japan . Tactical considerations would dictate the acquisition of full aircraft-carrier battle groups and significant naval air power . Spurred by energy , realities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. presence in Asian and Indian Ocean waters could significantly recede , Tokyo is approaching a moment of decision on its deployments in the early 21st century . THE NUCLEAR ALTERNATIVE <p> The increasing energy vulnerability of Asian nations , especially those in the northeast , makes nuclear power highly attractive . Japan generates nearly a third of its electricity from nuclear power , South Korea around 40 percent , compared to less than 20 percent in the United States . Northeast Asia , with its myriad geopolitical uncertainties , has by far the most ambitious nuclear programs in the world , at a time when Europe and America still recoil before the twin specters of Chernobyl and Three Mile Island . <p> For nations chronically short of energy like Korea , Taiwan , China , and Japan , nuclear reactors yield it in large quantifies at a low marginal cost without bulky imports , if only users can find a way of coping with high start-up costs , waste products , and safety concerns . With the fast-breeder reactor , nuclear power becomes a self-renewing source of energy that can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about acid rain , global warming , and other forms of pollution , nuclear power plants , unlike coal-fired ones , emit no greenhouse gases . For many in East Asia , given proper safety measures , nuclear power even appears to be an environmentally friendly substitute for oil and coal . <p> The region currently represents roughly 14 percent of global nuclear capacity . But U.S. Department of Energy forecasts suggest that Asia could account for 48 percent of new nuclear capacity worldwide between 1992 and 2010 , the bulk of the growth coming in Japan and Korea , with China and Taiwan not far behind . At least $160 billion in capital spending is scheduled for the next decade alone . The United States , by contrast , is expected to retrench ; the Energy Department expects America to have dose to 10 percent less nuclear capacity in 2010 than it does now . <p> In meeting their increasingly pressing energy needs , Asians may raise a swarm of problems . The favored long-term approach of many local energy producers , especially in northeast Asia , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power also produces large quantities of plutonium , the raw material for most nuclear weapons . Japan already has an active program of this sort , and China and South Korea are contemplating similar efforts . Such programs , if not carefully supervised , clearly raise risks of proliferation and terrorism . <p> North Korea 's energy ' deficiencies and nuclear ambitions are well known . Pyongyang 's October 1994 nuclear agreement with the United States to freeze and then gradually transform its nuclear program may , if implemented , ultimately defuse the danger of the North developing a large-scale military nuclear capacity . But even under the agreement , ambiguities will remain well into the next decade , and North Korea will have a political and perhaps economic interest in perpetuating them . Reunification of the peninsula , if it came , would sharply boost energy demand , especially in the north , as well as Korean desires to pursue a plutonium-generating complete nuclear fuel-cycle program . It would also bring together nuclear programs in the north and south that are in many ways complementary , possibly hastening the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilian one . <p> Taiwan is not likely to go nuclear overtly , as Deng Xiaoping and others on the Chinese mainland have cited that as a casus belli . Yet Taiwan could well move quietly closer to the nuclear threshold by reviving its military program of nuclear research . Like North Korea , Taiwan has a perverse reason to encourage limited uncertainty about its nuclear intentions , and fuel-cycle programs , under the guise of energy security , provide a credible way to do this . <p> Deepening nuclear uncertainties across northeast Asia could have especially troubling implications for Japan . That shadow superpower could easily go nuclear in a matter of months if the technology alone were at issue . If regional nuclear frictions worsen and the U.S. commitment to Japan 's security is vague , such a fateful move , although unlikely , is not inconceivable during the prospectively turbulent first decade of the coming century . POWER POLICIES <p> The United States and Japan are ideally suited to take the lead in developing an integrated package of economic and security measures to defuse mounting tensions in Asia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a far-sighted energy plan would be an important contribution to the summit meeting between President Bill Clinton and Japan 's new prime minister , Ryutaro Hashimoto , scheduled for later this spring in Tokyo . A comprehensive response would address four imperatives : securing the passage of the inexorably rising flow of oil through the Strait of Malacca ; encouraging the stable development of oil reserves in Asia , including China ; preventing proliferation and operational safety and spent-fuel storage problems associated with nuclear power ; and promoting cost-effective , environmentally acceptable alternative energy sources as well as energy conservation . <p> Recent steps by the Clinton administration , including declarations in mid-1995 of U.S. willingness to escort commercial shipping in an emergency , have made progress on reaffirming freedom of navigation in the strategic energy sea-lanes from the Persian Gulf to East Asia . The U.S. declarations focused on the South China Sea , but seaways west of the Strait of Malacca are also important . America 's intention to maintain sufficient capability in the area to render commitments to free navigation credible must also be reaffirmed continually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many Asians fear the picture may begin to change after the year 2000 , as China 's blue-water navy becomes operational and as presumed isolationist sentiment begins to tear at American resolve . <p> Ensuring the security of the southern seaways and of the pivotal states that dominate them particularly Indonesia and India  --  should loom larger and larger on the long-term U.S.-Japanese agenda , while Japan 's active involvement with Korean contingencies is relegated to a lesser place . Such a change of emphasis would unquestionably be supported throughout northeast Asia . Many Southeast Asians , by contrast , would welcome further Japanese involvement in their region , in which Japan already has more than $70 billion in direct investment . There will be many possibilities for joint U.S.-Japanese projects in the southeast , especially in energy efficiency and infrastructure . <p> Keeping China and Indonesia from becoming large-scale energy importers likewise deserves priority and could be furthered by cooperative initiatives , provided the economic interests of all parties are considered . The hand extended to Indonesia should involve official development aid for improved domestic energy efficiency and coordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy sector as well as for rationalization of domestic energy-pricing policies . In China , parallel efforts are an even more complex and significant proposition . <p> Energy cooperation among the United States , Japan , and China could be enormously important over the coming decade , both in moderating China 's oil imports and in breaking the dangerous new dynamic of escalating suspicion among the three economic giants of the Pacific . The United States and Japan bring highly complementary tools to the task : American technology and entrepreneurship joined to Japanese capital and the organizational skills of the keiretsu . Both countries , together with internationalist groups in China , have a clear interest in moderating and stabilizing Chinas entry into the global political economy , and joint projects could help achieve that . <p> International assistance , including help from Washington and Tokyo , could foster the development of the oil sector in China . It could improve the efficiency of slowly declining fields like Daqing and Shengli through secondary recovery techniques not widely available in China at present . Such assistance could also enable the development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xinjiang , that could not otherwise be easily exploited . The United States , Japan , and possibly other nations such as South Korea could collaborate in providing large-scale energy infrastructure like long-distance pipelines and electric power plants . Finally , the United States and Japan could pool their energy conservation expertise and apply it to China , whose energy consumption per unit of GDP stands at 4 times the world average , 5 times U.S. levels , and 12 times that of Japan . <p> Joint energy projects in China would need to be commercially viable for all parties , but government  --  the Japanese government especially  --  should help make them feasible , in part by offering development aid and export insurance to American as well as Japanese participants . There are encouraging precedents . Since 1991 U.S. and Japanese export credit agencies have jointly supported half a dozen major energy projects in Asia , particularly **26;406;TOOLONG power plants , which have helped address Asia 's chronic electricity shortages . Such projects , which typically pair U.S. heavy electrical equipment makers and Japanese general trading companies , have led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $3 billion in Japanese exports over the past four years . <p> Policy and diplomacy must take account of the definite possibility that Asia 's energy rivalries could become dangerously politicized , especially in an oil crisis . Unlike Europe , Asia has no mechanism for allocating energy in an emergency . The United States and Japan should cooperate with other Asian nations in establishing one . The two could also work to create a multilateral resource development regime for the South China Sea similar , perhaps , to accords that Indonesia , Malaysia , and Thailand have already achieved with one another . Such a scheme could significantly reduce the political risks of offshore exploration and development in the region and so spur multinational investment . To be successful , it would have to include China as well as Japan and the United States ; to encourage Chinese participation , the regime could be cast as part of a broader initiative toward China like those described above . <p> Nuclear proliferation , operational safety , and storage constitute a third pressing complex of issues with which a far-sighted Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem is not so much North Korea  --  which , given its chronic economic weakness , can hardly survive much longer in its present bellicose , autarkic form  --  as it is the future of nuclear reprocessing programs regionwide . Such programs generate large amounts of plutonium and highly toxic waste , and when pursued in politically fluid environments such as a reunited Korea or a decentralized Greater China , they could present major security and safety risks . <p> Establishment of a multilateral nuclear oversight agency Asia Atom  --  would be one good way to defuse the dangers . Like Euratom in western Europe , Asia Atom would register , monitor , and allocate supplies of plutonium throughout the region , guarding against proliferation or diversion to terrorists . It could also coordinate research on fast-breeder reactors and administer long-term programs to cope with the byproducts of the region 's rapidly expanding nuclear facilities . Any such body should include the United States , Canada , and Australia along with key Asian nations . <p> The final , and in some ways most important , imperative for Asian energy security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of energy . Biomass and solar technologies that turn plant material and agricultural waste or sunlight into power may have applications in parts of the region . Hydroelectric power and environmentally friendly uses of coal , including liquefaction and clean-coal technology , will be significant in China with its trillion-ton coal reserves , which currently provide three-quarters of the country 's energy . China is expected to account for two-thirds of the global increase in coal use over the next 15 years , making it the prime target for clean-coal technology assistance from the United States and Japan . <p> From an environmental standpoint , the most attractive alternative fuel is natural gas . It is plentiful in Asia , with major deposits identified in Siberia , off Sakhalin Island , near Natuna Island off Indonesia , and elsewhere in the South China Sea . Natural gas burns cleanly and generates almost no pollution . It is broadly adaptable to both consumer and industrial needs , including cooking , heating , and even mass transportation , as well as the production of fertilizer , cement , and steel . Malaysia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas in their urban transportation systems , while South Korea plans to spend close to $10 billion between now and 2000 to develop both compressed natural gas technology and electric cars . The two could meaningfully reduce Asian oil consumption , especially in China , and deserve strong support . <p> While natural gas has great advantages in crowded , polluted , energy-deficient Asia , large political and economic obstacles stand in its way . Gas is difficult to transport , requiring expensive liquefaction , pipelines , or both . That both its production and transport are highly capital-intensive introduces a major political risk factor for would-be suppliers , deterring investment . And gas prices are tied to market prices for oil , which fluctuate in response to unpredictable political and economic variables . <p> Public support for natural gas can help neutralize the risk . For two decades Japan 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry has vigorously promoted the use of natural gas at home ; something similar is needed now across Asia . While it is mainly up to Japan to provide development assistance , the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural gas megaprojects in Asia , as the Clinton administration did in the $40 billion 1994 agreement between Exxon and the Indonesian company Pertamina to develop the Natuna offshore field . Support for American gas exports to Asia is also important , from both a domestic and a Pacific perspective . <p> The Caspian Sea area of formerly Soviet Central Asia could be an important alternative source of oil and , especially , gas for China , Japan , and Korea , reducing their dependence on and increasing their leverage with the Middle East and Russia . Transporting the Caspian 's resources eastward would entail building the longest natural gas export pipeline in the world at a cost of well over $10 billion . Yet such a pipeline could well benefit the United States , diplomatically and economically , as well as the major East Asian nations . It offers another chance to transform the geostrategic danger of Asia 's energy shortage into opportunity . <p> Asia 's energy realities can not be reduced to a purely economic calculus . They have presently subtle but ultimately dangerous implications that should make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . It is profoundly in America 's interest to assure , through activism , that energy becomes a bridge for cooperation between the United States , Japan , and the potentially volatile continent of Asia , rather than a catalyst for distrust and uncertainty . <p> 1 The members of ASEAN are Brunei , Indonesia , Malaysia , the Philippines , Singapore , Thailand , and Vietnam . <p> MAP : OIL IMPORTS , ASEAN COUNTRIES <p> By Kent E.
