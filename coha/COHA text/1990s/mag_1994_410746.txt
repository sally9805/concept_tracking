Yvonne Haulsey made her living in New York City 's biggest and flashiest porn palace , performing one-on-one peep shows in the private fantasy booths at Show World Center at 42nd St. and Eighth Ave . On March 24 , 1991 , she was stabbed to death in a rear room of Show World Center . The 21-year-old lay dead , dressed in her skimpy work clothes , for several hours before her body was discovered , while her co-workers continued to lure customers into their booths for a peep . Critics point to Haulsey as evidence that the porn industry feeds sexual deviants and degrades women . Whatever the critics say , thousands of dollars are spent on pornography every day , and the neon lights of 42nd St. continue flashing , 24 hours a day , advertising sex shows and drawing customers . The sex shops in the Times Square area that have live peep shows also sell a variety of sex items such as magazines and toys . In addition to X-rated movie theaters and video stores , porn magazine shops , and topless bars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . Show World Center is a four-story monument to New York 's thriving retail sex industry . On display in the lobby 's window is a clipping from The New York Times describing the center as " the McDonald 's of sex . " Inside , men stroll through a room lined with movie peep booths that look like confessionals . Hidden speakers blast Madonna 's voice : " Let your body move to the music . " Customers are hit by the smell of strong disinfectant , used throughout the shop to clean the floors in the booths . The booths have doors that lock from inside . In each is a bench seat , a coin box on the wall , and a television screen . Movies are kept running by dropping tokens , purchased for 25 cents each , in the coin boxes . Al each end of ' Show World Center are staircases leading to the live peep show performers . The women are dressed in miniskirts , bikini underwear , laced halter tops , and skimpy bras . The walls also are lined with booths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five are needed to peep at a live woman . Giving her a $10 tip beforehand ensures an active performance . The men browse , checking out each of the women : white , black , Hispanic , Asian . A customer picks one and goes inside her booth , closing the door behind him . She enters her side of the booth and closes her door . He drops his tokens in a coin machine on the wall . A black curtain that covers the glass wall between them rises , and they stare at each other . Babs , who performed in Show World Center , graphically describes what happens next : " Customers would put in $5 for the curtain to rise for about a minute or a minute and a half . They usually stayed in there an average of five or six minutes . Most of them come in their business suits after work . They 'd just stand there and masturbate . I had maybe one or two that did n't . There was a phone and we would talk . There was a glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's pretty much it . " The Attorney General 's Commission on Pornography said in its 1986 report that peep shows are the biggest moneymaking portion of the porn industry , with annual nationwide net profits projected at $2,000,000,000 . According to William P. Kelly , a former FBI agent who investigated porn and now serves as a consultant on obscenity for various law enforcement and advocacy groups , " The biggest single income of any of it is the 25-cent coin or the token dropped in the peep show machine in the back of the dirty book stores . " A VICTIMLESS CRIME ? Ginger put herself through New York University performing in the peeps and maintains that the shows are innocuous fun . " It 's a safe , harmless way to have some erotica in one 's life . It is certainly victimless and should be accepted in society . " Betty Wein of Morality in Media disagrees . The New York-based agency works to stop the spread of pornography through the enforcement of anti-obscenity laws . Wein is horrified by peep movies involving bondage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peep emporiums are breaking the law . " I think Americans are insidiously being desensitized to decadence , to violence , to barbarism . I think peep shows are frightening peeps into decadence , a frightening peep into the dehumanization of women . Do n't tell me there are n't unhinged people looking at this as a blueprint for rape . " Dorchen Leidholdt of Women Against Pornography insists peeps and porn are in reality commercial exploitation of females and obstacles to social equality for women . " Show World and all of these emporiums are a cross between prostitution and pornography . The women are really being bought and sold . Obscenity laws do n't address the harm at all : the harm to the safety and the status of women . The porn industry is growing and men are being acculturated and socialized to view women as sexual objects . " Many people in the porn business say the performers are just people working a job . Alan , who owns a peep emporium in the 42nd St. area , says the women come from many walks of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women that have straight professions . I have some regulars . I have some part-timers . I have some , what I call , regular occasionals . If a girl is short of cash , she might work for a while . You really have to have a turnover . " The girls that do peeps are not hookers . They do not sell their bodies . This is a way for them to be in the industry without prostituting themselves . There is never contact in my operation . I will not knowingly hire anybody that is involved with drugs . " Ginger sees thing differently . " There are plenty of drug users and there are plenty of vegetarians . I guess you have more drug users in that industry than you would find in an equal number of paralegals . Some are prostitutes . But generally speaking , the girls in the peep shows do that because they 're not prostitutes . " Babs and Ginger indicate that their coworkers appeared to have come from stable backgrounds , but the Attorney General 's Commission on Pornography found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financially strapped . It concluded that they work under extremely poor conditions and are exposed to serious health hazards and strong temptations to use drugs . The commission also found that their personal lives suffer substantial injury to relationships , reputation , and self-image . However , the report points out that the findings are not concrete . " We acknowledge that exceptions exist to all these findings , and we conclude , as well , that extremely thorough investigation might prove one or more of them untrue . " Peep show performers paint a mixed picture of their profession . " It 's a job just like any other job , " maintains Eve , a professional body builder who worked at Show World Center . " You 're going to make money . You 're going to do things that are going to give you nightmares , but you deal with it . You count your money and you do n't think about it . " Many performers say their job is not very good , but the money is great . Ginger was so popular that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $125 per hour , and she is making more money than she did working the booths . She also posed for the March , 1991 , issue of Genesis magazine , earning $2,500 . At the booths , Ginger received minimum wage plus tips . When she first started , she made $50 to $100 per day in tips and later could earn a few hundred dollars in one night . The $5 needed to open the curtain went to the house . The customer usually tipped $10 or $15 , which she kept . Ginger would see 40 to 50 men on a busy night . She wo n't give her yearly income . " I do n't really pay taxes so let 's just leave it out . " The customers are mostly white men , according to a City University of New York study . The report says 97% of the sex shop patrons are men and 56% are white . Nearly 50% are white-collar workers ; 40% blue-collar workers . Forty-one percent are 25-34 years old , 29% 16-25 , and the rest are 35 and over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Center , serviced a wide variety of customers . " I had guys who work on Wall Street and wore very expensive clothes . I had kids who wore T-shirts and jeans . I had kids who looked like they were 21 and I had men who were quite elderly . I had definitely a lot of three-piece suits in there and a lot of them had wedding rings . " Tom , who sells space advertising for a magazine , goes to the peep shows even though he agrees their customers are disturbed . He started going to shows in high school and knows the 42nd St. area well . " There are people who just like this ... and I 'm one of them . It 's not like I 'm going to go out and rape someone . I think it 's important to clean it up because the city is part of the corruption . " Some sex shops offer a " key-hole " peep and " one-way mirror " peep , where performers can not see the customer . Another offers " custom peeps " so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific show , and then go there to see it . A third variation is " buddy peeps , " whereby two men in adjacent movie peep booths can watch each other through a glass wall between them . Patrick J. Suraci , a New York psychologist who specializes in sexual disorders , indicates there are a number of reasons men are attracted to peeps and porn . They like more variety of sexual stimuli than women do and are excited more by visual stimuli , while women react more to tactile stimuli . Also , males are more promiscuous . They want to have different kinds of sexual activity , adding an element of excitement and danger . " That danger element appeals to males . Danger does n't usually appeal to women . The danger heightens the sexual excitement . These men could be discovered in the peeps . Their reputations could be ruined . " For most people , porn is not harmful , Suraci notes , but it can be destructive for a group of people called paraphilics . " Paraphilia " is a psychiatric term for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are necessary for sexual excitement . Paraphilias are what Sigmund Freud called perversions . There are several different classifications of paraphilia , including sadism , masochism , exhibitionism , voyeurism , and fetishism . Suraci maintains that pornography does not turn people into paraphilics . " A paraphilia is a clinical disorder and some people have it and some do n't . You do n't develop it by going to these places . This stuff does not make you an addict . It will always be there and there 's a need for it in society for the normal guy . If it interferes with the person 's functioning , that 's how we define abnormal . " Peeps safely can fill a societal need , he says , " But there are a group of people , the paraphilics , who are drawn to them . It 's like they ca n't resist . They go to these places to fulfill their fantasies and then they 're filled with guilt . " Victor B. Cline , a clinical psychologist at the University of Utah , offers another view . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cline has identified four stages of the effects of pornography . First , a person  --  almost always a man  --  becomes addicted to pornography . Second , he escalates to more explicit " kinky " material . Third , he becomes desensitized to the pornographic materials that originally were perceived as shocking or taboo ; in time , they become acceptable and commonplace . Finally , he acts out the behaviors viewed in pornography . Another danger is that the videos and shows in the peep houses could be illegal under the state obscenity law . " When " performers " get into hard-core performances , they 're engaging in acts where the New York state obscenity law reaches , " says Bob Peters , staff attorney for Morality in Media . " I think it 's common knowledge that the ladies who perform in the 42nd Street area are not engaging just in topless dancing , or even in bottomless dancing . They 're doing sexual acts to satisfy the preference of the customer . " Morality in Media has a long-standing complaint that Manhattan District Attorney Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Neither the U.S. attorneys nor Mr. Morgenthau 's office has been willing , for many years , going on almost a decade now , to enforce the obscenity law , " Peters claims . " Illicit sex has been around for as long as humanity , so to try and suppress every bit of it would simply be unsuccessful . But when enforcement agencies do not enforce the obscenity laws , valid government interests at stake in curbing the flow of obscenity are n't furthered . Individuals suffer and society is the loser . " More X-rated video stores are popping up in Greenwich Village , SoHo , and Chinatown , Wein points out . " Now watch , they 'll start putting up peep show booths . This is absolutely what I predict . I think that Robert Morgenthau 's non-enforcement of the state obscenity laws for so many years is a major cause for the deteriorating conditions in Times Square , for the spread of that toxic matter , X-rated videos , in neighborhoods . " Prosecuting smut is easier said than done . " As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial burdens are imposed on prosecutors who seek to bring obscenity prosecutions , " notes James M. McGuire , deputy chief of the Appeals Bureau for the New York County District Attorney 's Office . " Prosecutors must show that the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that the particular item in question appeals to prurient interests , is patently offensive , and that it lacks any serious literary , artistic , political , or scientific value . That has proven to be an extraordinarily difficult , if not an impossible , task . " Given that fact , and the undeniable fact that we all live in a world of limited resources , it would be irresponsible for a prosecutor to devote resources to prosecutions which have such dismal prospects for success when doing so would necessarily mean taking resources away from areas where we do have excellent prospects for success : violent crimes , crack , and the like . " MOB INFLUENCES As much as people are worried about the proliferation of obscene material and acts , they also are concerned about the porn industry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Pornography supports what many people claim  --  that the porn industry is run by organized-crime families . " I do n't think that it 's an exaggeration to say that 90% or more is controlled or influenced by organized crime , " says Peters . Kelly agrees . " You 're talking organized crime families in New York with a large percentage of the movie business . You 'll find that probably 75% of them are ... organized crime figures . " He explains the business is filled with violence , noting that John Gotti , the reputed boss of the New York Gambino crime family , now in prison , allegedly was linked to the 1986 murder of Robert DiBernardo , a pornographer and top Gambino figure . " Robert DiBernardo was probably the most influential organized-crime Gambino family person in the history of the porno industry in the United States . " Before his death , investigators indicated that DiBernardo controlled Show World Center . Despite the attacks of porn critics , peeps and porn remain a vital industry that has established itself as a part of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feels the sex industry fills a societal need and always will be around . " They 're not going to stop it . They 're just going to cause it to relocate . It just makes me sick that people are concerned about peep shows when people are dying on the street . " He adds that there is another , more important element that keeps the porn houses running : " It 's business . " Mr. Wes Goodman is a New York free-lance journalist . <p>
