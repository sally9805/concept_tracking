He placed the burnished rosewood box on the table , then went to all the windows in turn , pulling the drapes together , tugging at the edges to make sure no gap remained . After he had started a fire and set the kettle on the blackened stove , he returned to the table . He opened the box and paused , a smile flickering across his face . The contents of the box gleamed in the candlelight . <p> " It was a triumph , Henri , " he said loudly . " All Paris will be talking about it tomorrow . The best yet . I wish you could have seen their faces  --  they were amazed ! " <p> " You are quite a showman , " his brother called back , his voice muffled by the intervening wall . " And the pretty Comtesse ? The one I saw the painting of ? " <p> Gerard laughed , a deliberately casual sound . " Ah , yes , the Comtesse de Buise . Her eyes were as wide as a little girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it home with her and keep it as a pet . " He laughed again . " So beautiful , that one , and so likely to be disappointed  --  at least in this . " He reached into the box and teased free the velvet ties . " No one will ever make a pet of my wonderful canard . " <p> With the care of a priest handling the sacrament , Gerard Vergalant lifted out the gilded metal duck and set it upright on the table . Eyes narrowed , he took his kerchief from the pocket of his well-cut but ever so slightly threadbare coat and dusted the duck 's feathers and buffed its gleaming bill . He paid particular attention to polishing the glass eyes , which seemed almost more real than those of a living bird . The duck was indeed a magnificent thing , a little smaller than life-size , shaped with an intricacy of detail that made every golden feather a sculpture unto itself . <p> The teapot chuffed faintly . Vergalant repocketed his kerchief and went to it . <p> " Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he called . " Old Guineau , the Marquis , he was most dismissive at first  --  the doddering fool . ' In my youth , I saw the bronze nightingales of Constantinople , ' he says , and waves his hand in that if-you-must-bore-me way he has . Hah ! In his youth he saw them build the Hanging Gardens of Babylon , I 'll wager . " <p> He poured the water into a teacup with a small chip in the handle , then a little more in a bowl which he set on the table . <p> " The old bastard went on and on , telling everyone about clockwork movement , how the Emperor 's nightingales would lift their wings up and down , and swivel their heads . But when my duck walked , they all sat up . " He grinned at the memory of triumph . " None of them expected it to look so real ! When it swam , one of the ladies became faint and had to be taken out into the garden . And when it devoured the pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guineau could not keep the astonishment from his face ! " <p> " I am always sorry I can not see your performances , Gerard , " his brother called , straining slightly to make himself heard . " I am sure that you were very elegant and clever . You always are . " <p> " It 's true that no matter how splendid the object is , " Vergalant said thoughtfully , " it is always more respected when presented in an attractive manner . Especially by the ladies . They do not like their entertainment rough . " He paused . " The Comtesse de Buise , for instance . There is a woman of beauty and pretty sentiment . . . " <p> The duck 's head rotated slightly and the bill opened . There was a near-silent ticking of small gears and the fiat gilded feet took a juddering step , then another . <p> " If you please . " Henri was apologetic . <p> " Oh my brother , I am so sorry , " Gerard replied , but his tone was still distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countess sullied by mundane things . He went to the table and fumbled at the duck 's neck for a moment , then found the catch and clicked it . " The tail seems to move a little slowly , " he said . " Several times tonight I thought I saw it moving out of step with the legs . " <p> The head and neck vibrated for a moment , then the entire upper structure tipped sideways on its hinge . Glassy-eyed , the shining duck head lolled as though its neck had been chopped through with an axe . <p> " If it was my fault , I apologize , Gerard . I do my best , but this duck , it is a very complicated piece of work . More stops than an organ , and every little bit crafted like the world 's costliest pocketwatch . It is hard to make something that is both beautiful and lifelike . " <p> Vergalant nodded emphatically . " True . Only the good Lord can be credited with consistency in that area . " He caught a glimpse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw , for he repeated the head movement with careful gravity . " And the Lord achieved that with the Comtesse de Buise . She has such lovely eyes , Henri . Like deep wells . A man could drown in them . You should have seen her . <p> " I wish I had . " The gilded duck shuddered again , ever so slightly , and then a tiny head appeared in the hollow of the throat . Although it was only a little larger than the ball of Gerard Vergalant 's thumb , the facial resemblance was notable . " But I can not make a seeing-glass that will allow me to look out properly without interfering with the articulation of the throat , " said the little head . Hair was plastered against its forehead in minute ringlets . " One can not have everything . " <p> " Still , " Gerard replied with magnificent condescension , " you have done wonderfully well . I could never hope to make such an impression without you . " <p> The rest of the tiny figure emerged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little man sat for a moment atop the decapitated duck , then climbed down its back , seeking toeholds in the intricate metalwork of the pinfeathers before dropping to the tabletop . <p> " It was a good night 's work , then . " Shivering , Henri hurried across the table toward the bowl of hot water . <p> " Yes , but we can not yet allow ourselves to rest . " Gerard looked on his brother fondly as Henri pulled off his loose clothing and clambered into the bowl . " No , do not be alarmed ! Take your bath  --  you have earned it . But we do need to develop some new tricks . Perhaps since it takes in food at one end . . . ? Yes , that might do it . These people are jaded , and we will need all my most sophisticated ideas  --  and your careful work , which is of course indispensable  --  to keep them interested . That old fop Guineau is very well connected . If we play our hand correctly , we may soon be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Henri lowered himself beneath the surface to wet his hair , then rose again , spluttering and wiping water from his face . " The King ? " He opened his eyes wide . <p> Gerard smiled , then reached into his pocket and produced a tooth brush . Henri stood and took it , although it was al most too large for his hands to grasp . As he scrubbed his back , water splashed from the bowl onto the table top . A few drops landed near the gilded duck . Gerard blotted them with his sleeve . <p> " Yes , little brother  --  the king ! Mother always said I would go far , with my quick wits and good looks . But I knew that one needs more in life than simply to be liked . If a man of humble origins wishes to make an impression in this world , if he wishes to be more than merely comfortable , he must know powerful people  --  and he must show them wonders . " He nodded toward the table . " Like the duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . astonished . " <p> Henri stepped from the bowl . He accepted his brother 's kerchief and began to dry himself , almost disappearing in its folds . <p> " Ah , Gerard , " he said admiringly . " You always were the clever one . " <p> <p> By Tad Williams <p> " Monsieur Vergalants Canard " marks popular novelist Tad Williams 's first appearance in F &SF.; Tad has written many other stories ( including one that recently appeared in Narrow Houses , a British anthology ) , but he is best known for his novels . Daw Books published his most recent , To Green Angel Tower , in 1993 <p> Tad says he ca n't quite explain the origins of this story . " I was reading Stephen Levy 's Artificial Life ( researching for the next multi-volume bloated epic , gasp , gasp ) and came across a reference to Vaucanson 's Canard , a famous automaton of the 17th century . . . . A few days later , the story just popped out , fully written in my head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
