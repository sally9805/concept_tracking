The three articles in this collection were first presented as part of a symposium , organized by Sue Kenyon , at the Annual Meeting of the Central States Anthropological Society in 1992 . The topic was a timely one then as it is now ; the geographic region under discussion is one of particular interest to scholars both of possession religions and of social change . The two topics are closely related , both here and in other parts of the world . As these articles show , possession beliefs and rituals are particularly dynamic and sensitive to their social contexts . This is a discovery of relatively recent origins . Authors who wrote about such religions , whether in surveys ( for example , Oesterreich 19661921 ) or in older ethnographies ( for example , Herskovits 1937 ) , thought of them as conservative , if not archaic . Thus , to see them grow and expand , not only serving as records of history but also registering migrations and other recent events , provides us with a renewed reason for studying them . <p> The three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or " hinges , " to other parts of the world . The Sudan is linked by many ties to Egypt , to North Africa and the larger Islamic world , to West Africa as reflected in the presence of Hausa bori spirits , and to Eritrea and Ethiopia to the southwest . The Swahili Coast , too , is linked to Islam and Zanzibar , but to inland Africa as well . Madagascar has roots and affinities in Southeast Asia as well as in Central and East Africa ; in addition it has tics to Christianity as well as to Islam , and to its colonial experience with France . By contrast , the other two locations have their primary European contacts with Britain and , in the case of Tanzania , with Germany , at an earlier time . <p> We know that possession beliefs expressed in trance states are widespread throughout the world . Indeed , they were found to be present in 52 percent of sample societies , worldwide ( Bourguignon 1973 ) . However , sub-Saharan Africa at 66 percent and the Insular Pacific area at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to this study . These recent first-hand ethnographic data on Sudan , the Swahili Coast , and Madagascar can contribute importantly to our understanding of such broad general findings . <p> It is important to stress the diverse cultural and colonial connections of the regions under discussion , for history and its representations can be seen to play key roles in the iconography of the possession trance religions described here , as they do in the case of many others . By iconography I do not mean only graphic or plastic representations , but above all the temporary embodiment of the spirits in ritual participants . The spirits are revealed in their appearance and behavior , in their tastes and preferences , in their demands and their powers . In this connection it is noteworthy that our authors say little about mythology in the traditional sense of the word as oral ( or written ) bodies of narratives . The often improvised ritual dramas , to a large extent , constitute the effective mythology . What is known of the spirits results from interactions with them and what they reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings described here , the ritual constitutes a drama that changes with each actor and each situation but that , over time , builds up a picture of the spirit protagonists . New characters appear , others fade from view . For example , in the Sudan , Kenyon tells us , there has been an influx of Ethiopian and Eritrean spirits , as there has been a migration of people from those regions during the years of war and strife . In Madagascar , as Sharp shows , there has been an emphasis in recent years on the embodiment of younger spirits : the playboy , cowboy , and prostitute spirits , who represent a general shift to " grandchildren " in the spirit hierarchy , and show thereby a new stress on the concerns of younger people . No longer arc the powerful royal ancestors the primary focus ; rather the lives and deaths of young people , and hence the problems of their generational peers , have become significant themes . Those who suffered a certain fate can , as spirits , give advice on how to deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ articles of this issue show us interesting similarities and differences . This is significant because they deal with what have been regarded as rather distinct regions , historically and ethnographically , in spite of their geographic proximity and long-term links through trade and Islam . Thus , the primary value of these articles lies in their fine-grained , jargon-free ethnographies . They contribute to our better understanding of the respective regions , in the context of a common problem : what , if any , is the relationship between what are , after all , old , established possession religions and ongoing contemporary change in the peoples ' lives ? The three authors are experienced and seasoned field workers , who have reported on other aspects of their work elsewhere . It is good to have them here together to provide us with a comparative perspective . All too often ethnographic materials are presented in isolation , with a narrow focus on a given location . When written in the context of a theoretical perspective that focuses on cultural uniqueness , the larger picture risks being lost . If , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine detail and the real lives of people may get short shrift . Here , by contrast , we have the opportunity of looking at three regions and of asking questions about similarities and differences that are raised by such juxtapositions . And , indeed , if we are not regional specialists , we may be prompted to ask questions relevant to our own research in other parts of the world . <p> Here then is a first such question : are possession religions , enacted in the drama of possession trance , on the rise everywhere ? Kenyon , for Sudan , and Sharp , for Madagascar , say they are : that is , there are old established religions of this type , but they are gaining new adherents , face new problems , present new spirits , and show an increase in the frequency of rituals . Giles , in her impressive regional survey of the Swahili Coast , says there is evidence that there may actually be a decline , at least in parts of the area . On the other hand , she shows some surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than in rural areas . Sharp , we note , deals with an urban area in Madagascar , and Kenyon 's Sennar is a good-sized town . Here it may be helpful to consider evidence from other parts of the world . Studies in the Americas ( Haiti , Cuba , Brazil , for example ) have consistently shown greater elaboration of rituals and of their supporting organizations , as well as more frequent performances of rituals , in urban areas . This may be associated , as Giles suggests , with the availability of greater resources in urban areas . Perhaps it is also connected to the fact that , as , for example , in Haiti , in rural areas ritual and ritual organizations are largely family-based , while in urban areas cult leaders attract followers on the basis of their reputations and those of their spirits . Corin ( 1979 ) has made a similar point for Zare . In urban areas , in particular , the interaction with other institutions may also be of relevance , as seen , for example , in Kenyon 's interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a hospital setting , or in Sharp 's account in her recent ( 1993 ) book of the relationship between mediums and schools . <p> Another broad question we may ask concerns the involvement of women in the possession trance religions . Kenyon notes that the majority of leaders and participants in zar today are women , and so does Sharp for Madagascar mediums . Giles speaks of a rise in the participation of women , claiming a greater leadership role for men in earlier periods . The participants , in the majority , are women as they have been in the past . <p> The preponderance of women in possession religions has been a primary focus for many scholars and observers . Explanations for the association of females and possession have been varied and have generated considerable debate . In her recent review article Boddy ( 1994 ) virtually omits reference to possession among men . Local-level explanations are sometimes offered . For example , in America and Europe nineteenth-century Spiritualists argued that women were ideal mediums because they were sensitive and used to suffering , explanations still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who linked possession trance and multiple personalities to hysteria ( Kenny 1986 ) , found explanations for these conditions in women 's physical and psychological constitutions . In anthropology arguments have ranged from possession as weapons of the weak and deprived ( Lewis 1971 ) to questions of nutrition , particularly calcium deficiency ( Kehoe and Giletti 1981 ) . Raybeck et al . ( 1989 ) have shown in a sophisticated model , that nutritional , psychological , and sociocultural explanation may be seen as complementary , not competitive . The articles here draw attention to several other dimensions of this issue . For example , mediums and their clients everywhere are heavily involved in diagnosis and healing , whether of medical or life problems . This is most dramatically shown in Kenyon 's account , but it appears elsewhere as well . Women everywhere are the majority of patients seeking help for themselves and their children , whether in biomedicine or alternative therapies , in traditional forms of healing or whatever other forms of support may be available . It is therefore not surprising to see them seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moving from patient to healer , becoming healers themselves . It must be remembered , however , that while women may be the majority of patients or help seekers as well as the majority of mediums or cult leaders , men are always part of the picture , whatever their public position against the cults in Islamic societies . They do not question the existence of spirits , as part of their overall view of the world ; they help support the healing rituals of family members in situations of crisis or stress . <p> In the Swahili coastal area , according to Giles , women may be , or have been in the past , among the most powerful cult leaders , with a clientele of women ; but men have also participated directly in possession cult activities , especially in the role of cult leaders . In Madagascar , according to Sharp , male and female aspects of ritual should be balanced . While women are the mediums , men serve other complementary functions , such as drummers or slaughterers . A male spirit balances a female medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over zar by men in the context of modernization is particularly interesting . When the cults involve the private lives of women and families , women may well be in charge ; in Sudan , when zar acquired a public face , men sought to take over . It should also be noted that men play a large symbolic role in the beliefs and rituals of possession religions , if we may interpret the widespread presence of male spirits and the consequent enactment of male spirit roles by women in this manner . It has been suggested that the spirit possession religions , whether expressed in zar ( Lewis 1986 ) or in Korean shamanism ( Kendall 1985 ) , are but one component of an overall religious system that also includes male-dominated aspects , such as Islam in the Sudan , ancestor worship in Korea , or Catholicism in Haiti . The religious system then may best be seen as a pluralistic one , like the health care system of the Sudan described in Kenyon 's study . More importantly , without an understanding of each component of the religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategies of people in the face of change is severely limited . The possession religions described here have important practical implications , with metaphysical concerns in lesser evidence . Coping , as already noted , involves dealing with problems of health and illness and the struggles of everyday life . It also involves the presence of strangers , variously powerful , threatening or fascinating . Women play the roles of men , of foreigners of various categories , of alien categories , such as prostitutes . As Stoller ( 1989 ) suggested , we can see spirit possession as cultural critique or even as an expression of cultural memories ( Stoller 1994 ) . <p> Kramer ( 1993 ) also considers possession and " mimesis " as a tool for criticizing the alien . Whether women embody male spirits , Africans embody aliens , or Malagasy embody royalty or playboys , in each case a transaction is expressed in the transformation . One of the aspects of this transaction is communication , communication not between the spirit and the medium  --  the possession episode is likely to be covered by amnesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always a triad . Lambek ( 1981 ) has discussed this in some detail for the people of Mayotte , in the Comorro Islands . Hurston ( 1938 ) called her book on Haiti Tell my horse , for that is what Haitian spirits say when they wish to leave a message for their human hosts . Communication has to take place by way of a third party because the host 's ( the " horse 's " ) own spirit is temporarily displaced by the visiting entity . The third party is drawn into the relationship between the spirit and its host . Whether the message concerns every day life or matters of ritual it may often involve innovations or transformations , elaborations or losses . <p> These brief remarks have touched on only a few of the many interesting questions raised in these fine papers . The spirit religions described in them show us dynamic systems that not merely reflect ongoing changes in their societies , but may also act as agents or facilitators , even as critics , of change . As the three scholars who present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to report on further transformations of the communities , their ritual practices and the changed perspectives on the world they ( and we ) may infer from their observations . As these articles make abundantly clear , the artificially constructed categories of the anthropological classroom , based as they are on the separation of institutions in American life , have little relevance to our understanding of the experience of people to whom social criticism , coping strategies , health care , religious ritual , worldview , and aesthetics are one . We need more such joint presentations of reports on related research enterprises .
