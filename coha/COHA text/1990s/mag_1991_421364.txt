Section : SPECIAL REPORT : THE ECO-BIZ It 's rich , powerful , and looking for new lands to conquer . But can the most successful eco-force keep its seal of approval ? <p> THE COMPUTER ON DICK DILLMAN 'S DESK IS blinking with the pulse of the vast Greenpeace network . A few strokes on the keyboard and he can send a memo to international headquarters in Amsterdam , talk with the seven boats in the Greenpeace navy or the two helicopters and one hot-air balloon in the Greenpeace air force , conference with any of the more than twenty-four Greenpeace national offices or the scientific substation in Antarctica , get updates from the Greenpeace diplomatic corps , post messages for any of the Greenpeace foot-soldier " campaigners " spread across the globe , or request the services of the press office , the publications division , the mobile pollution laboratories , the world 's second-largest environmental photo archive , and the many mountain climbers , deep-sea divers , sky divers , pilots , skippers , bridge hangers , video crews , scientists , and rabble-rousers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions . " <p> Dillman is the bearded San Francisco biker who built this Greenpeace telecommunications empire . " I am convinced , " he intones , as he turns from the screen , " that there is a need in Greenpeace for a blimp . " <p> Somewhere on the other side of the world is David McTaggart , the high-school dropout and self-made millionaire who heads Greenpeace International . McTaggart does n't really sit much of anywhere but moves  --  from his Italian villa to the Amsterdam offices , around the USSR , throughout Eastern Europe . The fast-talking , impatient McTaggart ca n't be bothered with blimps . He wants a Greenpeace satellite . <p> According to a Greenpeace USA source , Greenpeace has already gone " shopping " for a satellite and even " investigated using a decommissioned vehicle for a nuclear weapon " for putting it in orbit . Independent verification of atomic-bomb tests , spying on global deforestation from space  --  the satellite is a typically McTaggart-sized idea . So is the price tag , and the project is on the back burner . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not outlandish to think it could tomorrow . In the United States alone , Greenpeace has a membership base of 2.5 million , which is growing by 77,000 a month , and a budget that has doubled every two years for a decade and now stands at fifty-eight million dollars . " Frankly , " confided one U.S. Greenpeace staff member , " they have more money than they know what to do with . " <p> Internationally , Greenpeace has become the most ambitious attempt to build a world-scale radical organization since Lenin 's Communist International of the early twentieth century . Worldwide , Greenpeace has over twenty-four ofrices , with more soon to open . In the Netherlands , more than one household in ten has at least one Greenpeace member . And in a marketing survey that asked West Germans , " What do you admire most ? " Greenpeace scored second to gold . Greenpeace organizers entered Eastern Europe in the wake of the democratic revolutions there and were literally mobbed : during the campaign bus 's ten-day tour around Prague , Czechs snatched up 1,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved into the USSR in 1987-two years prior to the Eastern European upheaval  --  in typical Greenpeace style , getting rock stars to kick open the door with Rainbow Warriors , the first major album ever released simultaneously in the West and the USSR . McTaggart went straight to the top , meeting in the Kremlin with Gorbachev . <p> A radical organization that suffers an excess of money , that could make a serious run for electoral office in key countries but demurs , whose diplomatic corps dwarfs that of some nations , and that boasts its own navy , air force , and possibly a space program  --  this is power on a scale most movement activists do n't dare dream of . Greenpeace dreams of more . McTaggart envisions environmental strife bringing governments crashing down , and Greenpeace picking up the geopolitical pieces . Meanwhile , his organization has set its sights on Latin America , then Asia . <p> But changing the entire world will mean navigating some wild and uncharted territory , and as Greenpeace 's weight grows , so does the chance that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people it needs on its side . Does Greenpeace understand how risky its self-appointed mission really is ? <p> THE EARLY GREENPEACE WAS AN EXCEEDINGLY UNLIKELY candidate for global environmental superpower . Founded in Vancouver in 1971 , its initial objective was to protest U.S. nuclear-weapons testing off the coast of Alaska by sailing a decrepit boat to the test site . They never made it . The organization was run with a haphazardness that could only have existed at the tail end of the 1960s . " I 'm one of the few people who was around when they used to throw the I Ching to figure out what to do next , " laughs Dillman , who still spends his time away from the computer , " sleazing " around Bay Area biker bars . <p> But Greenpeacers had other assets : a tremendous imagination about direct action , savvy about the press , and the audacity to convince themselves that they were launching a world-scale undertaking . In 1972 , the group hooked up with David McTaggart , a developer contemplating the meaning of life from the privacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his yacht to the Moruroa atoll to protest French atmospheric nuclear-bomb testing there . For two weeks , the French navy tried to drive McTaggart from the site , then rammed the yacht with a minesweeper . <p> McTaggart returned to Moruroa in 1973 , and French commandos boarded his yacht and beat him severely . Twelve years later , French agents sank the Rainbow Warrior on its way to yet another protest at Moruroa , killing a Greenpeace photographer in the attack . McTaggart sued , and the ensuing scandal nearly brought down the Mitterand government , which eventually settled for $8.2 million . While McTaggart spent time in Paris fighting the case , he helped start Greenpeace offices throughout Europe . <p> By the late seventies , Greenpeace had expanded its focus and won huge international notoriety through campaigns to save first the whales and then the Newfoundland harp seal . But the campaigns also revealed the problems that arise when a small group of mostly male white people goes charging around the world saving the planet without checking in with the majority of its inhabitants . Angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Appearing on the arctic ice with cuddly baby harp seals and French actress Brigitte Bardot did wonders for fund-raising , but when the bottom eventually fell out of the seal-pelt market , it was n't Greenpeace that paid the price . <p> GREENPACE " Inuit Eskimo communities suffered because they could n't sell their pelts , " admits Greenpeace USA spokesperson Peter Dykstra . " Probably some people went hungry . " <p> Winona LaDuke , an Amishinabe activist in northern Ontario , knows who went hungry . " Forty native communities in the Arctic had their economies totally devastated by the seal campaign , " she declares . <p> The most bitter dispute between Greenpeace and the Eskimos emerged over the bowhead-whale campaign , which became so widely discussed within indigenous-rights networks that , a full decade later , when Greenpeace approached Mohawk Indians on the Akwesasne reservation in New York about collaborating to fight toxic dumping , the Mohawks insisted that the first item on the agenda be the bowhead whale . <p> Meanwhile , turf struggles emerged among the Greenpeace offices that were springing up right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organization apart . As the whale and seal campaigns made it clear that this organization could raise a lot of cash , the infighting escalated . " We would occasionally have meetings where we behaved like congresspeople behave when a military base is to be sited in one of their districts , " Dykstra recollects . By 1979 , the Vancouver and San Francisco offices had sued each other for control of the organization , and the entire house of cards was ready to collapse . <p> In stepped McTaggart the entrepreneur to broker the deal that framed the current Greenpeace structure . He placed Greenpeace USA under a national office on neutral turf in Washington , D.C. , while Greenpeace International became a separate , parent organization , based in Amsterdam under President McTaggart . <p> Greenpeace took off into the 1980s . Soon the same motorized inflatables that had positioned themselves between harpooners and whales were disrupting British ships dumping radioactive waste off the coast of Spain . From newly acquired riverboats , divers went down to plug pipes polluting rivers and lakes . Backpackers hiked into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Greenpeace skydiver became a media hit . <p> IN A WORLD DESPERATELY SHORT OF HEroes who stand up , even symbolically , to the forces of environmental catastrophe , the Greenpeace roadshow is a hard act to follow . So the money , fame , and support comes pouring in . But even as Greenpeace has resolved the worst of its internal turf battles , its relations with the rest of the world have grown increasingly difficult . <p> After two decades of playing rugged-individualist eco-cowboys , Greenpeace has amassed real power . The power , for example , to destroy an indigenous economy based on seal hunting , which , as LaDuke points out , can come back to haunt in unexpected ways . " Their economies are gutted , " LaDuke says of the Arctic 's native communities . " And then the multinationals come in to look for oil . When you have economic control , you can resist these thing.s " <p> To exercise its power effectively will require skills that have not so far had top billing in the Greenpeace circus : constituency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But here Greenpeace is rather limited . For all its growth and expansion , Greenpeace remains an eminently " European " organization . It has organized Europeans in Europe , and their descendants in North America , Australia , and New Zealand . Given that the world 's tropical rain forests grow in places like Malaysia and Guatemala , given what Greenpeace itself describes as the global nature of the environmental crisis , such cultural uniformity is a serious problem , and some of those running the organization recognize this . <p> " When the history of how the world was or was n't saved is written , if we are to make a serious difference , we do n't have any choice , " asserts Steve Sawyer , the volunteer who , at thirty-two , rose to become the Greenpeace International director in Amsterdam . We need people of color . Without them we may still have the opportunity to speak to and influence the power structure , but , in some fundamental way , we 'll be just another extension of it . " <p> In the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of toxics . Most chemical waste is not dumped at sea among the whales , but in the backyards of poor , nonwhite communities , where environmental groups have often been organizing for years at the grass roots . Some have expressed resentment at what they see as Greenpeace 's lack of ongoing political dialogue with locals . <p> " They come into a community and do an action , and then there is a big letdown , " explains one veteran activist , who has helped organize dozens of towns to fight polluters . " People say , How can we follow that act ? ' You have to understand these are people grasping at straws , who found all their actions ineffective . " Another critical activist describes Greenpeace as " the Delta Force of the environmental movement " : they get in , get out , and leave without a trace . <p> Greenpeace USA 's antitoxics campaign , however , is developing along very different lines from the rest of the organization . Daredevil stunts are few and far between , while attempts at coalition-building with community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Native Americans , from twenty-five tribes , converged at Dilkon , Arizona , to discuss toxics dumping on reservations , an issue that has become increasingly charged as waste traders have discovered that reservation land is exempt from state and local environmental regulations . The conference was funded by Greenpeace , but this time the political direction was left in the hands of the participants . <p> This approach has received less than unanimous support within the organization , however . And the rather insular Greenpeace leadership can still show a glaring lack of sensitivity . The Southwest Network for Environmental &; Economic Justice , a toxics fighting eight-state coalition of grass-roots activists of color , wrote Greenpeace in May 1990 , recommending that , " Within a year , people of color compose 50 percent of your staff and Board of Directors , " and requesting assistance for training activists of color . Four months later , there had been no reply . " I do n't know him . I have n't had time to meet the guy , " explained USA executive director Peter Bahouth , a brash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is still in his thirties , and has had no political experience outside of Greenpeace . <p> Richard Moore , the " guy " who signed the Network letter , said the group was " astonished " that Greenpeace did n't respond ( Bahouth finally did , the day after he was interviewed for this story ) . " We represent seventy-five community-based organizations in the Southwest . We wonder if this is how they operate throughout the world . Can Greenpeace sit at the table and be equal partners in this ? From what we 've seen , at the present time , the answer is no . " <p> FROM THE ANTI  --  VIETNAM WAR MOVEment of the 1960s down through the Free South Africa movement today , white radicals in the North have always found the multicultural challenge easier to confront when dealing with cultures beyond their own national borders . Greenpeace is no exception . " It 's easier to deal with something further away , because you 're not up against the real hard choices , " admits Bahouth . <p> In Santiago , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sits Juan Carlos Cardenas , a soft-spoken Chilean veterinarian . Cardenas is part of the nucleus of Greenpeace Latin America , the first full-scale effort by Greenpeace-or any other First World environmental organization  --  to sink real roots in the Third World . <p> The computer atop Cardenas 's desk is connected to Dillman 's via satellite . But while their computers blink with the same overload of Greenpeace information , the two men see the world quite differently . Until five months ago , Cardenas , who spent much of the last decade working in poor Chilean fishing communities , had never used a computer . <p> " It 's a violent cultural change , " he says of his job with Greenpeace . The computer is the least of his problems , for molding First World environmentalism to Latin American reality is no easy task . " What Greenpeace becomes here is an open question , " he sighs . " It could be marvelous or monstrous . But it 's like Latin America itself : marvelous or monstrous , it will always be vital . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled delicately is nothing new . Due to creative organizing by indigenous Amazonians , for example , U.S. progressive circles are learning that the First World can not simply charge , uninvited , into the Amazon and " save " a rain forest that provides a way of life for entire cultures . But even the most sympathetic of northern ecoactivists often do not realize that virtually all environmental issues look different from the South , and the discrepancies , says Cardenas , make real North-South collaboration look tough . <p> Take something as seemingly cut-and-dried as tuna and dolphins . <p> Dolphins and tuna school together . In the 1960s , fishing fleets started following dolphins to find tuna , then netting them along with the tuna . Environmentalists howled , and , in 1972 , the Marine Mammal Protection Act , one of the real accomplishments of Earth Day I , imposed new regulations on the U.S. tuna industry . The dolphin kill began to diminish . In 1988 , the Act was amended to ban from the U.S. market all tuna caught with a high dolphin kill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three largest U.S. tuna firms announced that they would buy and can only tuna identified as dolphin-safe by independent observers on tuna boats . Greenpeace campaigner Traci Romine called the development " a major victory , the most important event since the Marine Mammal Protection Act . " <p> It looks different from the South . <p> One of the world 's most important tuna-fishing areas lies off Latin America 's Pacific coast , but it has been exploited , almost entirely by the U.S. fleet . In the 1980s , a developing Latin American fleet began to give the U.S. fleet a run for its money . <p> This Latin American fleet kills vast numbers of dolphins . Part of the problem is political : the fleet has been totally unregulated . But the problem is economic , as well . Much of the tuna is exported to the United States for hard currency . With U.S. banks squeezing blood out of these economies to service huge foreign debts , there is tremendous pressure to increase the tuna catch . What 's more , the largest tuna tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more efficient to send large tuna down the assembly lines in U.S. tuna canneries , bigger tuna bring more per pound on the U.S. market . <p> Feeling the heat in the market from Latin American competitors , U.S. tuna interests began to grumble . Soon Congress passed an amendment requiring countries selling tuna on the U.S. market to reduce their dolphin kill within three years to near the standard obtained by the U.S. fleet . Tuna from countries that did not comply were to be banned from the U.S. market , and if the situation was not remedied , all fish from those countries would be embargoed . Furthermore , even fish from countries that buy from those foreign fleets and sell to the U.S. market were to be embargoed . <p> " For Latin America , " explains Cardenas , " this was a declaration of war . " By 1990 , the new law was in effect and several countries became candidates for embargo . Everyone was waiting for the shoe to drop when the major U.S. canneries announced their own embargo . It was a master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eyes of U.S. consumers , returned the U.S. tuna fleet to the monopoly that the Latin Americans had worked for years to break , and appeared to harness the U.S. environmental movement to the whole project . <p> So when Greenpeace Latin America 's staff members went knocking on doors to introduce themselves , a Mexican fishing official accused Greenpeace of fronting for the CIA . From the Mexican perspective , the Greenpeace program seemed a backdoor channel for U.S. business interests to push their agenda in Latin America . <p> Latin American Greenpeacers took up the issue with their northern counterparts . " We had a very heavy discussion , " Cardenas remembers . " The fundamental point was the embargo , for , through it , U.S. law is indirectly regulating Latin American resources . To us , this focus was very U.S.  --  centric , and , if continued , would have led to severe contradictions between Greenpeace in the United States and Latin America . " <p> In the end , Greenpeace USA agreed to " explicitly not support the embargo but work for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was Greenpeace 's first real policy step toward becoming a truly multicultural organization . <p> In May 1990 , the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission , the forum where the U.S. and Latin America hash out these issues , held what some feared would be its final meeting , as the issue of embargo threatened to explode the commission . <p> Greenpeace , arrived with a united U.S. Latin American delegation . " The meeting quickly reached an impasse , " Cardenas recounts , " and Greenpeace was the only actor which could form a strategy in which all actors had input , which could build alliances . " Working from the anti-embargo position , Greenpeace emerged with an informal agreement with the Latin American governments . The agreement holds that the dolphin kill must end . But it insists that the objective be viewed as a " technology transfer " issue that needs international financing for observers on boats and Latin American-based research , while market incentives must be structured to make dolphin-safe fishing a good deal for Latin America . <p> " The Latin American governments saw for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cardenas concludes with a smile . " We call it Greenpeacestroika . " <p> It is quite an accomplishment for only a year of work , but Cardenas is not particularly elated . He shrugs . " It 's all palace politics . This is not what we want Greenpeace to be . The bottom line is that we tie ourselves to a social movement , a social base . Otherwise we will be co-opted by governments . " <p> VETERAN GREENPEACE USA LEADER JOHN Hinck acknowledges : " We must be more sophisticated in our analysis , and we must talk to these people . The key in the future is to warn people ahead of time . The problem is that , in the past , we did n't really think the campaigns would win . So , of course , we would n't go to some fishermen and tell them to prepare for our campaign . " <p> The idea that warning the majority of the planet 's inhabitants in the Third World to prepare for the fallout from environmental campaigns conceived and executed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange that could be the basis for a truly multicultural environmental movement . How to do it right was the overriding concern when Greenpeace 's fledgling Latin America team gathered in Rio de Janeiro for a week last August to map strategy . This highly sophisticated bunch , which included specialists in ocean ecology , nuclear matters , and international environmental law , met from morning to night , exchanging torrents of words while enthusiastically consuming red meat , white sugar , and cane alcohol , a dead giveaway that these were not your standard-brand U.S. environmentalists . <p> Tani Adams , the thirty-six-year-old Guatemala-born , U.S.-raised firebrand who directs the program , is proud of the team that she assembled : " These people come from different places , but have reached similar conclusions about what needs to be done to save this region of the earth , and what people from Latin America might contribute to resolving the environmental crisis as a whole . " Adams , who is also on the board of the Foundation for National Progress , which publishes Mother Jones , concludes , " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the cultural reality of Greenpeace . " <p> Rio was a surreally apt setting . Half of the city is the vacation spa of the richest people in the world , the other half home to a desperate working class struggling under the weight of the worst economic crisis in modem Latin American history . The slums of some of the poorest people in the world are scattered in sewers and dumps throughout the whole mess , which is crowded into a fantastically beautiful setting rapidly turning into an ecological disaster area . <p> To survive in this environment , Greenpeace will have to remake itself . In Europe and the United States , Greenpeace always leaped before it looked . As John Hinck has put it , " We always had to go out front first and get some momentum going , so you always made mistakes . " In politically and economically polarized Latin America , the margin for that kind of error simply does n't exist . So Greenpeace Latin America spent its first year just looking , commissioning indepth studies of the Latin American environmental crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sips strong Brazilian coffee before one of the Rio meetings , Marcie Mersky remembers a " skill-sharing " seminar she had organized in Guatemala months before for European Greenpeacers . " It was all carefully planned to have a controlled experience , " Mersky says . On the first morning , the visitors boarded a bus for a look at Guatemalan agriculture . Less than an hour away from the hotel , they came upon soldiers combing a field . Two soldiers dragged out the body of a campesino . Further up the road , soldiers had herded a large number of campesinos into an army truck . Another body was being dragged toward the vehicle . The soldiers waved the busload of gringos on . Welcome to Latin America . <p> Mersky , a U.S.-born ecologist with more than a decade of work in Latin America , now coordinates the program 's toxics campaign from her home in Guatemala . And like the toxics campaigners in the United States , she is trying to involve the grass roots . " Central American campesinos have terrible environmental problems , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say things like , The land is dying . ' " She wonders what Greenpeace can really offer them . " They are very , very poor . You ca n't even approach them about pesticides unless you have a real alternative to offer . " <p> The work of Sergio Lopez , on the other hand , is more concerned with the forces that keep those peasants in their place . A young , intellectual , Paris-educated Mexican lawyer , Lopez is the Latin American member of the Greenpeace diplomatic corps , which rivals that of some Latin American countries . He and his colleagues are now some of the leading experts on treaties and international environmental law . Governments have turned to Greenpeacers like him to help interpret and even write sweeping legislation . How cozy should Greenpeace get with these regimes ? <p> As the discussions proceed , the questions multiply much faster than the answers . Who should be " members " ? What could a Colombian peasant who hardly participates in the cash economy contribute to become a " member " ? How can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America and indigenous grassroots environmental organizations , which often can not even afford to rent office space ? How can " direct actions " be pulled off without activists getting shot by militaries not schooled in the finer distinctions of nonviolent civil disobedience ? <p> What does it mean to have a Latin American program ? " Greenpeace is arriving in a different form in each country , " notes Cardenas . " Mexico , Uruguay , Chile , these are different realities . You can say you 're planetary , but here in Brazil , that 's poetry . It 's an idea for music and dancing . Here , you must acquire a national character . " <p> Carlos Lopez Iglesias , a former university professor who directs the Argentine office , sums up the team 's vision over late-night firewater . " The hardest thing in our countries is to reconstruct the sense of citizen protagonism , which was mutilated and destroyed by the military dictatorships . Greenpeace can be a catalyst in that process , a nonparty way to push civilian participation in daily life . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become too closely allied with opposition projects , and in others , too close to the small bourgeoisie . We could be strangled by political polarization . It will require a high level of political imagination . " <p> Optimists point to the success of Greenpeace Latin America 's first major public action , spearheaded by Sara Larrain , a Chilean specialist in nuclear issues . Ships loaded with radioactive waste regularly pass through the Panama Canal , Larrain announced to the world during an August 1990 Greenpeace press conference . In the United States , such shipments are legally banned , but the U.S. administrators of the canal do n't apply their own country 's protections . <p> " A cargo which represents an undeniable danger for North American citizens and their environment represents the same danger for the people and government of Panama , " Larrain declared to the Panamanian press . She also noted that the ship Pacific Sandpiper would soon enter the canal , loaded with radioactive cargo . <p> The event was a bombshell in post-Noriega Panama , whose government had , after all , ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Local journalists ran to government officials , who were caught so unaware that one began taking notes on details of Larrain 's revelations . Panama 's foreign minister publicly thanked Greenpeace for the information . <p> The next day , student groups blockaded a downtown intersection , with banners denouncing the shipments . The signature hightech stunts of northern Greenpeace were absent , but when the Sandpiper came through , local groups were at the canal , protesting the ship 's presence . <p> For Larrain , these events offer a model for what Greenpeace Latin America could become . " We were a catalyst for the local groups , " she concludes . In the politically charged atmosphere of a country invaded by the United States less than a year before , it would have been very dangerous for locals to denounce the U.S. double standard of running the canal without Greenpeace backing . Greenpeace 's international research apparatus and worldwide legitimacy were used as tools to " open the space for them to speak with their own voice . " <p> THERE IS A NEW KIND OF POLITICS EMERGing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whose voices get heard . The outcome will have broad implications for Greenpeace and the entire First World environmental movement . <p> The outline of this new politics is most clearly discernible in the Southern Cone countries  --  Brazil , Argentina , Chile , and also Uruguay-where strong radical movements rose to threaten the ruling order in the 1960s , only to be smashed by brutal military repression . Activists there have had two decades of dictatorship under which to contemplate their errors . Rejecting their past dogmatism , they have left party politics behind and are likely these days to be found teaching adult literacy , giving technical and legal assistance to rural cooperatives and urban squatters , and searching for new models of citizen empowerment . <p> " The difference between Right and Left is increasingly confused , " explains Cardenas , long active on the Chilean scene . " People see that political parties do n't allow real democratic space . There are new forms of grassroots democracy being built , organizations that will not move in the direction of becoming parties .... The most important element @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . " <p> This is the complex and creative terrain where Greenpeace has landed , on the cutting edge of radical Latin American thought . Northern Greenpeace leaders , like many other First World progressives , have trouble thinking strategically . Indeed , for two decades , they have lived on action , not strategy . <p> Ask Peter Bahouth about a long-term vision for Greenpeace and he waffles , offering tidbits like " The purpose of the organization is to be campaign-driven . " Longtimer John Hinck sums up two decades of Greenpeace strategy like this : " Our idea was to make problems as public as possible and then trust that people would intuitively make the right choice . " The problem now is that , while the environmental crisis has finally become hot news , too many powerful people still are n't making the right choice . <p> Yet Greenpeace is in many ways well positioned to make a synthesis with its new partners in the South . For Greenpeace has stumbled , by design , intuition , and luck , in roughly equal parts , into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved out for themselves so diligently . The organization eschews party politics , adheres strictly to nonviolence , and at its best serves as a catalyst for local organizing . And it has the resources necessary to make its visions reality , resources that the Latin Americans lack . <p> Its particular approach to internationalism offers tremendous possibility . The Greenpeace North-South link is being made not on the traditional basis of " aid " to the poor South , nor of " solidarity " with leftist vanguards . Instead , Greenpeace is attempting to construct a disciplined , centralized , international organization on the basis of common struggle against common enemies  --  from transnational corporate polluters to the World Bank . <p> The obstacles in its path are daunting , and some parts of the Latin American line will be easier to swallow than others . Larrain cautions : " I do n't see Greenpeace as the major protagonist . What is most important here is the service it can provide to the Latin American environmental cause . " Such stay-in-the-background sentiments will run strongly against the grain of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hog the spotlight . <p> " This kind of cross-cultural dialogue is difficult , believe me , " sighs Adams . " It takes time . And with the social and ecological crises exploding all over the world , there is more and more pressure and less and less time . It 's particularly acute in the Third World , due to the huge gap between rich and poor . <p> " As far as we know , Greenpeace is one of the few spaces that exists in the world to do this , where citizen groups can sit down together and hash these things out . Just getting Europe and the United States together is complex . Latin America adds another level , not to mention Africa and Asia . It may fail . But it 's something you really have to take one day at a time , and , as simplistic as it sounds , the key is for all sides to take the time to really sit down and listen to each other , learn how the whole fits together , and then act on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last grand scheme for radical internationalism still fouling the air , today would hardly seem an auspicious moment for grandiose dreams of a new , world-embracing social insurgency . But Greenpeace , which began with a creaky old boat of peaceniks , limping alone on the sea to a nuclear test it never reached , now wields power on a scale that more than a handful of governments might envy . And , as Greenpeacers constantly point out , with a global environmental disaster breathing down our necks , what choice is there ? <p> " It 's not easy , " sighs Mersky , as we talk late into the night , the polluted waters of Rio 's once-pristine beaches lapping at the sand before us . " But in the world we live in , this is a reasonable place to start . " THE ECO-BIZ Inside Greenpeace , Inc <p> " The people who are drawn to this organization hate structure , " says Greenpeace USA 's Peter Dykstra . Still , it 's possible to chart the ties that bind Greenpeace International to its national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into " campaigns "  --  ocean , ecology , toxics , tropical forests , atmosphere and energy , and disarmament and over twenty-four national offices are given wide latitude in determining how campaigns are carried out . But the international office in Amsterdam holds ultimate power through control of the Greenpeace trademark , which it licenses to the national offices . The national offices raise the money , and kick some of it back to Amsterdam . <p> How democratic is Greenpeace ? Any Greenpeace USA member or staffer of six years can vote for board members . Policy decisions come from the board and the executive director , while the real content of the campaigns is determined by campaign coordinators . While some activists thrive on this decentralized opportunity , loose cannons have , on occasion , dragged the organization into a mess . <p> The Greenpeace USA board has three members , all of them white : David Chatfield , a veteran of the old Friends of the Earth ; Tani Adams , who did pesticide organizing in Texas and now coordinates Greenpeace 's Latin America program ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board , and add people of color . <p> As head of the International board , David McTaggart still wields big clout . But a lot of Greenpeace policy is thrashed out through the International Council , on which every national office that gives 24 percent of its income to Greenpeace International has one vote . With its many national offices , Europe holds a majority in the council . Some see this as an unfair majority , now that Latin America , the Soviet Union , and Japan have been added . The problem is that Greenpeace USSR 's rubles are useless , and Greenpeace Latin America wo n't be self-sufficient anytime soon . Meanwhile , Latin America is being organized as one region instead of on a country-by-country basis . So who gets to vote ? At this point , searching for a new answer is tense ; the matter has been tabled twice . <p> Money . In 1990 , the Greenpeace International budget hit $32 million . In 1988 , Greenpeace in the United States split into Greenpeace USA and Greenpeace Action , the latter abandoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their total membership of 2.5 million makes Greenpeace the nation 's largest environmental group , with a budget of $58 million ( fourth highest ) . Executive Director Peter Bahouth still makes a frugal $45,000 , as compared to , say , the Sierra Club 's executive director , who gets $86,000 . <p> Controversial , however , is the ratio of funds spent on fund-raising versus program activities . Most of the money comes from a huge direct-mail operation and a smaller , but still growing , door-to-door canvass . For every dollar Greenpeace Action collected in 1989 , a substantial 32 cents was spent getting it . The New York-based National Charities Information Bureau rates the worthiness of nonprofits in part by this fund-raising-to-program criteria . Greenpeace has not filed its financial data with the Bureau for several years . <p> Greenpeace leaders argue that their approach buys independence . " We do n't solicit money from corporations or the government because we do n't want to be beholden to them , " asserts Greenpeace USA board member Chatfield . " Who 'd want to be in hock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc. , the toxics-disposal giant , does give eco-grants , and even applied to join the Environmental Grantmakers Association , a coalition of big funders . Some at the EGA were unhappy , and quietly asked Greenpeace to protest . They knew that self-sufficiency gave it the freedom to raise hell .  --  BOB OSTERTAG <p> <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) : Its eco-warriors cut bold figures when getting in the way of whalers on the open seas .

With Mother Jones associate editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 issue . <p> FATHER GREENPEACE Looking ahead with David McTaggart <p> MJ : What is the biggest challenge confronting Greenpeace ? McTaggart : It used to be apathy . These days , it 's directing green energy in the right direction .... We need to channel the wave , focus it on a handful of make-or-break issues in the next decade . What is the biggest threat ? Certainly there are many , but one that must be addressed is nationalism . We have gotten to the point where racism is condemned internationally as a form of barbarism , but when it comes to nationalism  --  hey , different story . That 's our oil , that 's our grain , that 's our auto industry In the next century , we are going to he faced with issues which simply can not be addressed on a nation-by-nation basis . Only with the Latin American Program has Greenpeace made a serious effort to organize in the Third World . Why did this take so long. ? The question is how we did it so quickly . It took from 1971 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the organization to sit down in the same room . It 's taken ten more years to get them working together smoothly What we are trying to do is work together internationally , despite centuries of nationalist prejudice . <p> We made a decision long ago that Greenpeace would he a tight ship , that we would not go handing out franchises like a fastfood chain Instead of sending emissaries scattering off to the four winds , we decided to make expansion a subject of international review , test cases , and a dedicated department of the organization . <p> Latin America , quite honestly , is the test child . How we emerge as an organization ready to take on the problems of Africa and India and Southeast Asia will depend a great deal on how we adapt in Latin America . To work outside Europe and North America , we need to reinvent our tactics , our fund-raising , our personnel policies  --  everything . There have been some bitter lessons along the way . The trick is to make sure they make us stronger without destroying us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of challenges . You can talk about the green wave in the West , where corporations are putting nice pictures of pine trees on their product labels , but the green wave in the Soviet Union is a massive tidal force that is knocking politicians , nuclear-power plants , and western multinationals out of the way . <p> We have had some successes already . The unilateral Soviet moratorium on nuclear testing was straight out of a briefing paper we submitted to Gorbachev . ... The Soviet decision to stop whaling , and to support the creation of a world park in Antarctica are other areas where we 've managed to get our foot in the door . What are the most contentious issues in Greenpeace ? You name it , it 's contentious  --  straight up from the kind of cotton our T-shirts should be made from to whether or not we put a satellite in orbit . I 'm far happier with an organization of stubborn-ass strugglers than a room full of bureaucrats who can say yes in twelve languages . We 're in the business of challenging authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streamlined , corporate profile . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Father Greenpeace <p> By BOB OSTERTAG <p> HOW THEY PULL IT OFF <p> " Our job is to be in their face , all the time . " That is how communications czar Dick Diliman sums up the Greenpeace brand of civil disobedience . In fact , the direct-action stunt has become Greenpeace 's finely honed product , crafted with years of experience and the latest technology , a sure sell to the media . Take , for example , a recent action protesting the entrance of the nuclear battleship New Jersey into the self-designated nuclear-bee port of Astoria , Oregon . The seemingly simple plan was to have climbers hang from a bridge over the Columbia River with a banner , blocking the New Jersey 's route up the narrow passageway to port , while a rally took place down below . <p> The climbing coordinator quietly slipped into town early , to surveil the bridge and map out the maneuver . With him was the campaign coordinator , and together they worked out the action down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the photo most likely to appear in the papers was the one they wanted . The climbers arrived later at a mountain resort far enough away so as not to attract attention , practiced the new moves they would use for the stunt , and learned the radio gear . <p> On the morning of the action , a van drove across the bridge , depositing climbers armed with radios and banners . The climbers quickly anchored the ropes and began their descent . The moment that all were in a position where no authorities could reach and nab them , they radioed a go ahead . <p> The crucial moment had arrived . If the New Jersey just steamed on through , the climbers would not have time to climb out of its path ; they could be injured or killed . So Dillman had set up a secret command post days earlier , from which he surveilled the area 's radio traffic , located the New Jersey 's frequency , and studied the dialogue . Dillman , who had to know how to beam his voice to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fooled into acknowledging . For if the New Jersey did not acknowledge his transmission , sailed right through the banner , and harmed a Greenpeacer , the navy could later claim that it had not been forewarned . <p> Given the news that the climbers were in place , Dillman took a deep breath , summoned up his most official voice , and barked into his mike . " New Jersey , this is Astoria Safety One with information concerning your approach . Oven " <p> " Astoria Safety One , this is New Jersey . Go ahead . " <p> Dillman relaxed . " New Jersey , this is Astoria Safety One . Please be advised that Greenpeace activists are hanging from the bridge , blocking your approach .... " <p> The stalled New Jersey was forced to send out helicopters to view the scene ahead . The demonstrators on shore went wild . The press ate it up . And , of course , in case the media had missed their cue , Greenpeace photographers and video crews were on hand , documenting every move . <p> PHOTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct action .
